            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HAVING been, for ſome time, a labourer in the Drama, and finding it neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue my labours, I cannot help endeavouring to guard the paſt from miſrepreſentation, leſt my ſupineneſs may injure the future. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that a prejudice has been created againſt the Play which I now ſubmit to the Reader, and conſcious how far I am innocent of raiſing it, it were ſtupid to ſit down in ſilence, and thus tacitly acknowledge myſelf guilty of dulneſs;— dumbly confeſs I have been deficient in the knowledge of my trade, damn myſelf for a bungling workman, and fix a diſrepute upon every article which may, hereafter, come from my hands.</p>
            <p>Thanks to you, Ladies and Gentlemen! you have been kind cuſtomers to me; and I am proud to ſay that you have ſtamped a faſhion upon my goods. Baſe, indeed, and ungrateful were the attempt, after your favours, ſo long received and continued, to impoſe upon you
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0072801100:3"/>
a clumſy commodity, and boaſt it to be ware of the beſt quality that I ever put up to ſale! No— on the word of an honeſt man, I have beſtowed no ſmall pains upon this <hi>Iron Cheſt,</hi> which I offer you. Inſpect it; examine it; you ſee the maker's name is upon it. I do not ſay it is perfect; I do not pretend to tell you it is of the higheſt poliſh; there is no occaſion for that:— many of my brethren have preſented you with mere <hi>linings for cheſts,</hi> and you have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent:—but, I truſt, you will find that my <hi>Iron Cheſt</hi> will hold together, that it is tolerably ſound, and fit for all the purpoſes for which it was intended.</p>
            <p>Then how came it to fall to pieces, after four days wear?—I will explain that:—but alas! alas! my heart doth yearn, when I think on the taſk which circumſtance has thruſt upon me.</p>
            <p>Now, by the Spirit of Peace, I Swear! were I not doomed to explore the rugged wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Drama, I would wrap myſelf in mute philoſophy, and repoſe calmly under the dark ſhade of my grievance, rather than endure the pain, and trouble, of this explanation.— I cannot, however, cry "Let the world ſlide:" I muſt purſue my journey; and be active to clear away the obſtacles that impede my progreſs.</p>
            <p>I am too callous, now, to be annoyed by thoſe innumerable gnats and inſects, who daily dart their impotent ſtings on the literary traveller; and too knowing to diſmount, and waſte my time in whipping graſshoppers:—but here is a ſcowling, ſullen, black Bull, right athwart my road;—a monſter of magnitude, of the Boeotian breed, perplexing me in my wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings through the entangled labyrinth of Drury!
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0072801100:4"/>
he ſtands ſulkily before me, with ſides, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly impenetrable to any laſh, and tougher than the Dun Cow of Warwick!—His front out-fronting the brazen bull of Perillus!—He has bellowed, Gentlemen! Yea, he hath bellowed a diſmal ſound! A hollow, unvaried tone, heaved from his very midriff, and ſtriking the liſtener with torpor!—Would I could paſs the animal quietly, for my own ſake!—and, for his, by Jupiter! I repeat it, I would not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly harm the Bull.—I delight not in baiting him.—I would jog as gently by him as by the aſs that grazes on the common: but he has obſtinately blocked up my way—he has already toſſed and gored me, ſeverely—I muſt make an effort, or he batters me down, and leaves me to bite the duſt.</p>
            <p>The weapon I muſt uſe is not of that bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, and keen quality, which, in a ſkilful hand, neatly cuts up the ſubject, to the delight, and admiration, of the bye-ſtanders: It is a homely cudgel of Narrative; a blunt batoon of Matter of fact; affording little diſplay of art in the wielder; and ſo heavy in its nature, that it can merely claim the merit of being appropriate to the opponent at whom it is levelled.</p>
            <p>Pray, ſtand clear!—for I ſhall handle this club vilely: and if any one come in my way, he may chance to get a rap, which I did not intend to beſtow upon him. Good venal and venomous gentlemen, who dabble in ink for pay or from pique, and who have dubbed yourſelves <hi>Criticks,</hi> keep your diſtance now! Run home to your garrets!—Fools! ye are but <hi>Ephemera</hi> at beſt; and will die ſoon enough, in the paltry courſe of your inſignificant natures, without thruſting
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0072801100:5"/>
your ears (if there be any left you) into the heat of this perilous action.—A vaunt!—well, well, ſtay if ye are bent upon it, and be pert and buſy;—your folly, to me, is of no moment.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ye who impartially, and conſcientiouſly, ſit in diurnal judgment upon modern dramatiſts, apply not this to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It aims only at the malevolent, the mean, and the ignorant, who are the diſgrace of your order.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I haſten now to my Narrative.</p>
            <p>I agreed to write the following Play, at the inſtance of the chief Proprietor of Drury-Lane Theatre; who, unconditionally, agreed to pay me a certain ſum for my labour:—and this certain ſum, being much larger than any, I believe, hitherto offered on ſimilar occaſions, created no ſmall jealouſy among the Parnaſſian <hi>Sans Culottes</hi>; ſeveral of whom have, of late, been vapidly induſtrious to level, to the muddy ſurface of their own Caſtalian ditch, ſo <hi>Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocratico-Dramatick</hi> a bargainer. The Play, as faſt as written, (piecemeal) was put into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal: But let it here be noted, gentle reader! that a rehearſal, in Drury-Lane, (I mean as far as relates to this Iron Cheſt) is <hi>lucus à</hi> non <hi>lucendo.</hi> They yclep it a rehearſal, I conjecture, becauſe <hi>they do</hi> NOT <hi>rehearſe.</hi> I call the loved ſhade of Garrick to witneſs; nay, I call the leſs loved preſence of the <hi>then</hi> acting Manager to avow,—that there never was one fair rehearſal of the Play.—Never one rehearſal, wherein one, or two, or more, of the Performers, very eſſential to the piece, were not abſent: and <hi>all</hi> the rehearſals which I attended, ſo ſlovenly, and irregular, that the ragged maſter of a theatrical Barn, might have bluſhed for
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0072801100:6"/>
the want of diſcipline in the pompous Director of His Majeſty's Servants, at the vaſt and aſtoniſhing new-erected Theatre-Royal, in Drury-Lane.</p>
            <p>It is well known, to thoſe converſant with the buſineſs of the ſtage, that no perfect judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be formed of the length of a Play, apparent to the ſpectator, nor of the general <hi>effect</hi> intended to be produced, until the private repetitions, among the actors, have reduced the buſineſs into ſomething like <hi>lucidus ordo:</hi>— then comes the time for the judicious author to take up his pruning-knife, or handle his hatchet. Then he goes luſtily to work, my maſters! upon his curtailments, or additions; his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, his loppings, his parings, trimmings, dockings, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. As in the writing, ſo in the rehearſal.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"Ordinis haec virtus erit et venus, aut ego fallor;"</l>
               <l>"Ut jam nunc dicat, jam nunc debentia dici"</l>
               <l>"Pleraque differat, et praeſens in tempus omittat:"</l>
               <l>"Hoc amet, hoc ſpernat, promiſſi carminis Auctor."</l>
            </q>
            <p>But, woe is me! while I was patiently wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the expected criſis, a circumſtance occurred which compelled me to watch a criſis of a leſs agreeable nature. A fever attacked me, as I ſat beneath the damp dome of Drury, and drove me, <hi>malgrè moi,</hi> to bed; where I lay during a week, till three hours before the Play was exhibited. In addition to the unavoidable injury ariſing from the author's abſence, Mr. KEMBLE, the acting-manager, and principal performer in the piece, was, and had been for a few days, previous to my own illneſs, confined
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0072801100:7"/>
to his chamber, by indiſpoſition. I lay little ſtreſs, indeed, upon his temporary incapacity to perform his managerical duty; his mode of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging it, hitherto, was productive of little benefit to me;—Still it was <hi>ſome</hi> drawback— for were a mere Log thrown amidſt a Theſpian community, and nominated its dull and ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ruler, ſtill the block, while in its place, would carry ſome ſway with it:—but his non-attendance as an actor, ſo much engaged in the Play, was particularly detrimental.</p>
            <p>Nay, even the Compoſer of the muſick— and here let me breathe a ſigh to the memory of departed worth and genius, as I write the name of STORAGE—even he, could not preſide in his department. He was preparing an early flight to that abode of harmony, where choirs of Angels ſwell the note of welcome to an honeſt, and congenial ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Here then was a direct ſtop to the buſineſs? No ſuch thing. The Troops proceeded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaders: In the dark, <hi>Meſſieur.!—"Sans</hi> eyes, <hi>Sans</hi> every thing." The Prompter, it is true, a kind of non-commiſſioned officer, headed the Corps, and a curious march was made of it!</p>
            <p>But, lo! two days, or three, (I forget which) previous to the public repreſentation, up roſe King KEMBLE! like Somnus from his ebon bed, to diſtribute his dozing directions among his ſubjects.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"Tardâ gravitate jacentes"</l>
               <l>"Vix oculus tollens;"</l>
               <l>"Summaque percutiens nutanti pictora mento,"</l>
               <l>"Excuſſit, tandem, ſibi ſe; cubitoque levatus," &amp;c.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0072801100:8"/>He came, ſaw, and pronounced the Piece to be ripe for exhibition. It was ordered to be performed immediately. News was brought to me, in my ſickneſs, of the mighty <hi>Fiat</hi>; and, although I was told, officially, that due care had been taken to render it worthy of public attention, I ſubmitted with doubt and trembling to the decree. My doubts, too, of this boaſted care, were not a little increaſed by a note, which I received from the Prompter, written by the Manager's order, <hi>three hours only,</hi> before the firſt repreſentation of the Play:—wherein, at this late period, my conſent was, abruptly, requeſted to a tranſpoſition of two of the moſt material ſcenes in the ſecond act: and the reaſon given for this curious propoſal was, that the preſent ſtage of Drury—where the Architect and Machiniſt, with the judgment and ingenuity of a Politician and a Wit to aſſiſt them, had combined to outdo all former theatrical out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings—was ſo bunglingly conſtructed, that there was not time for the carpenters to place the lumbering frame-work, on which an Abbey was painted, behind the repreſentation of a Library, without having a chaſm of ten minutes in the action of the Play; and that in the middle of an act.—Such was the fabrication of that New Stage, whoſe <hi>"extent</hi> and <hi>powers"</hi> have been ſo vauntingly advertiſed, under the claſſick management of Mr. KEMBLE, in the edifying exhibition of Pantomimes, Proceſſions, Pageants, Triumphal Cars, Milk white Horſes, and Elephants!</p>
            <p>As I did not chuſe to alter the conſtruction of my Play, without deliberation, merely to ſkreen the ill-conſtruction of the Houſe, I would
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0072801100:9"/>
not liſten to the modeſt, and <hi>well timed</hi> demand, of turning the progreſs of my fable <hi>topſy turvy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Very ill, and very weak, from the effects of the fever, which ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> not, yet, left me, I made an effort, and went to the Theatre, to witneſs the performance. I found Mr. KEMBLE, in his dreſſing-room, a ſhort time before the curtain was drawn up, taking <hi>Opium Pills:</hi> and, nobody who is acquainted with that gentleman will doubt me when I aſſert, that, they are a medicine which he has long been in the habit of ſwallowing. He appeared to me very unwell; and ſeemed, indeed, to have imbibed,
<q>
                  <l>"Poppy and Mandragora,"</l>
                  <l>"And all the drowſy ſyrups of the world."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Play began; and all went ſmoothly, till a trifling diſapprobation was ſhewn to the character perſonated by Mr. DODD;—the ſcene in which he was engaged being much <hi>too long:</hi> A proof of the neglect of thoſe whoſe buſineſs it was to have informed me (in my unavoidable abſence from the Theatre) that it appea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed in the <hi>laſt rehearſals,</hi> to want curtail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I conſidered this, however, to be of no great moment; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Mr. KEMBLE was to appear immediately in a ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And, here, let me deſcribe the requiſites for the character which I have attempted to draw, that the world may judge whether I have taken a wrong meaſure of the perſonage whom I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to fit: premiſing that I have worked for him before, with ſucceſs, and, therefore, it

            <p>Look at the actor;—and will any body do him the injuſtice to declare that he is deficient in theſe qualifications? It would puzzle any author, in any time or country, from Aeſchylus down, even, to the Tranſlator of <hi>Lodoiſka</hi>—and really, gentlemen, I can go no lower—to find a figure and face better ſuited to the purpoſe. I have endeavour'd, more-over, to pourtray <hi>Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Mortimer</hi> as a man ſtately in his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, reſerved in his temper, myſterious, cold, and impenetrable, in his manner: and the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did obſervers, I truſt, will allow that Mr. KEMBLE is thouroughly adequate to ſuch a perſonation.</p>
            <p>To complete my requiſitions, I demanded a performer who could enter into the ſpirit of a character proceeding upon romantic, half-witted principles, abſtracted in his opinions, ſophiſticated in his reaſonings, and who is thrown into ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where his mind and conduct ſtand, tiptoe, on the extremeſt verge of probability. Here, ſurely, I have not miſtaken my man; for if I am able to form any opinion of him, as an Actor,—and my opinion, I know, is far from
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0072801100:11"/>
ſingular,—his chief excellence almoſt approaches that ſtyle which the learned denominate <hi>Carica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Poſſibility on the ſtretch, paſſion over-leaping it's cuſtomary bound, movements of the ſoul, ſullen, or violent, very rarely ſeen in the common courſe of things, yet ſtill <hi>may</hi> be ſeen —in theſe is his element. As our language is ſaid to have ſunk under the vaſt conception of MILTON, ſo does the modeſty of nature ſuffer a depreſſion beneath the unwieldy imaginings of Mr. KEMBLE. He ſeldom deigns to accompany the Goddeſs in her ordinary walks; when ſhe decently paces the regular path, with a ſober ſtep, and a ſtraight perſon: but he kindly aſſiſts her when ſhe is, doubtleſs, in need of aſſiſtance —when ſhe appears out of her way, crazy and crooked.</p>
            <p>The arrogant fault of being more refined than Refinement, more proper than Propriety, more ſenſible than Senſe, which, nine times in ten, will diſguſt the ſpectator, becomes frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an advantage to him, in characters of the above deſcription.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, Mr KEMELE is a paragon-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of the <hi>Luſus Naturae:</hi> and were Mr. KEMBLE ſewed up in a ſkin, to act a hog in a pantomime, he would act a hog with ſix legs better than a hog with four.</p>
            <p>If any one aſk why I choſe to ſketch a <hi>Luſus Naturae</hi> when it might better become an author to be chaſte in his delineation, I can only reply that, I did ſo to obtain the aſſiſtance of Mr. KEMBLE in his beſt manner; and that now, I do moſt heartily repent me: for never, ſure, did man place the main ſtrength of his building upon ſo rotten a prop!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0072801100:12"/>Well, the great actor was diſcovered, as <hi>Sir Edward Mortimer,</hi> in his library. Gloom and deſolation ſat upon his brow; and he was habited, from the wig to the ſhoe-ſtring, with the moſt ſtudied exactneſs. Had one of King CHARLES the Firſt's portraits walked from its frame, upon the boards of the Theatre, it could not have afforded a truer repreſentation of ancient and melancholy dignity.</p>
            <p>The picture could not have looked better— but, in juſtice to the picture, it muſt alſo be added, that, the picture could ſcarcely have acted worſe.</p>
            <p>The ſpectators, who gaped with expectation at his firſt appearance, yawned with laſſitude before his firſt <hi>exit.</hi> It ſeemed, however, that illneſs had totally incapacitated him from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the buſineſs he had undertaken. For his mere illneſs he was entitled to pity; for his conduct under it, he, undoubtedly, deſerved cenſure.</p>
            <p>How can Mr. KEMBLE, as a Manager, and an Actor, juſtify his thruſting himſelf forward in a new Play, the material intereſt of which reſted upon his own powers, at a moment when he muſt be conſcious that he had no powers at all?—Mr. KEMELE owes a duty to the publick, to his employer, and to an author writing for his employer's houſe. How does he treat the claimants upon his ſervice, in this inſtance? Exactly, thus—he inſults the underſtanding of the firſt, and injures the intereſts of the two laſt, by calling in a crowd to an entertainment which he knows he muſt mar.</p>
            <p>I requeſted him, at the end of the firſt act, to order an apology to be made for his indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0072801100:13"/>
leſt the uninformed or malicious, might attribute the ponderoſity of the performer to the heavineſs of the author. I was anxious to diſavow all right and title to thoſe pigs of lead which did not belong to me, and of which Mr. KEMBLE was the juſt proprietor. But no—he peremptorily declared he would not ſuffer an apology to be made! It ſhould have been made (if at all) before the play began.—Then why was it not made?—He did not, <hi>then,</hi> imagine that illneſs would have diſabled him.—So, then, a man quits his chamber, after an attack which has, evidently, weakened him extremely, and he has no bodily feel, no internal monitor, to whiſper to him that he is feeble, and that he has not recovered ſufficient ſtrength to make a violent exertion!—This mode of reaſoning, adopted by Mr. KEMBLE, is much in the ſpirit of that clown's, who did not know whether he could play on the fiddle 'till he tried. Be it noted, alſo, that Mr. KEMBLE was ſwallowing his opium pills, <hi>before</hi> the play began, <hi>becauſe he was ill:</hi>—but opium cauſes ſtrange oblivious effects; and theſe pills muſt have occaſioned ſo ſudden a lapſe in Mr. KEMBLE's memory, that he forgot when he took them, why he took them, or that he had taken them at all.—The doſe muſt have been very powerful.—Still, for the reaſons already ſtated, I preſſed for an apology; ſtill Mr. KEMBLE continued obſtinate in oppoſing it. His indiſpoſition, he ſaid, was evident; he had coughed very much upon the ſtage, and an apology would make him <hi>"look like a fool.."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Good-nature in exceſs becomes weakneſs; but I never yet found, in the confined courſe of
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0072801100:14"/>
my reading, that good-nature and folly would bear the ſame definition: Mr. KEMBLE, it ſhould ſeem (and he produced, at leaſt, mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerical <hi>authority</hi> for it) conſidered the terms to be ſynonimous. Freely, however, forgiving him for his unkindneſs, in refuſing to gratify a poor devil of an author,—who, very anxious for his reputation, was very moderate in his requeſt—I do, in all chriſtian charity, moſt ſincerely wiſh that Mr. KEMBLE may never find greater cauſe to <hi>look like a fool</hi> than an apology for his indiſpoſition.</p>
            <p>At length, by dint of perſeverance, I gained my point. A proprietor of the Theatre was called in upon the occaſion, whoſe mediation in my favour carried more weight with the Acting Manager than a hapleſs Dramatiſt's entreaty; and the apology was, in due form, delivered to the audience.</p>
            <p>One third of the Play, only, was yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and I was, now, to make up my mind, like an unfortunate traveller, to purſue my painful journey, through two ſtages more, upon a broken-down Poſter, car whoſe back lay all the baggage for my expedition. Miſerably, and moſt heavily in hand, did the Poſter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed!—He groaned, he lagged, he coughed, he winced, he weezed!—Never was ſeen ſo ſorry a jade! The audience grew completely ſoured, and, once completely ſoured, every thing, naturally, went wrong. They recurred to their diſapprobation of poor DODD—and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what this produced. I muſt relate it.</p>
            <p>Mr. KEMBLE had juſt plodded through a ſcene, regardleſs of thoſe loud and manifeſt tokens that the Criticks delight not in the
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0072801100:15"/>
               <hi>"drowſy hums"</hi> with which he <hi>rang night's "yawning peal,"</hi> when DODD appeared to him on the Stage; at whoſe entrance the clamour was renewed. Then, and <hi>not till then,</hi> did the Acting Manager, who had been deaf as any poſt to the ſupplications of the author for an apology—then did he appear ſuddenly ſeized with a fit of good nature. He voluntarily came forward <hi>"to look like a fool,"</hi> and beg the indulgence of the town. He feared he was the unhappy cauſe of their diſapprobation; he entreated their patience, and hoped he ſhould ſhortly gain ſtrength, to enable them to judge, on a future night, what he handſomely termed the <hi>merits</hi> of the Play. Here was friendſhip! Here was adroitneſs! While the Publick were teſtifying their diſguſt at the Piece, through the medium of poor DODD, Mr. KEMBLE, with unexampled generoſity, took the whole blame upon his own ſhoulders, and heroically ſaved the author, by ſo timely an interpoſition. I was charmed with this maſter-ſtroke, and, at the impulſe of the moment, I thanked him. But, alas! how narrow is the ſoul of man! how diſtruſtful in its movements, how ſcanty in its acknowledgments, how perplexing to itſelf in its combinations! Had I, afterwards, looked on the thing ſimply and nakedly, by itſelf, why the thing is a good-natured thing: but I muſt be putting other circumſtances by the ſide of it, with a plague to me! I muſt be puzzling myſelf to ſee if all fits; if all is of a piece. And what is the reſult?—Miſerable that I am! I have loſt the pleaſure of evincing a gratitude, which I thought I owed, becauſe I no longer feel myſelf a debtor. Had I abandoned my mind
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0072801100:16"/>
to that placid negligence, that luxurious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, which the inconſiderate enjoy, it had never occurred to me that Mr. KEMBLE, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing, perhaps, that an aggrieved author might not be totally ſilent—ſteped forward with this ſpeech to the publick, as a kind of <hi>ſalvo,</hi> (ſhould a ſtatement be made) for his rigidity in the firſt inſtance. It had never occurred to me that Mr. KEMBLE was ſufficiently hiſſed, yawned at, laughed at, and coughed down, to have made his apology <hi>before</hi> Mr. DODD appeared: It had never occurred to me that his making his apology at a previous moment would have anſwered the ſame purpoſe to <hi>me,</hi> and not to <hi>him:</hi> It had never occurred, in ſhort, that there is ſuch a thing as oſtentatious humility, and a politick act of kindneſs; and that I ſhould have waited the ſequel of a man's conduct, before I thanked him for one inſtance of ſeeming good will, cloſe upon the heels of ſtubborn ill-nature, and in the midſt of exiſting, and palpable injury. The ſequel will ſhew that I was premature in my acknowledgment—but before I come to the ſequel, a word or two (I will be brief) to cloſe my account of this, the firſt night's, eventful hiſtory. The Piece was concluded, and <hi>given out,</hi> for a ſecond performance with much oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <p>Friends, who never heard the Play read, ſhook their heads; Friends, who <hi>had</hi> heard it read, ſcarcely knew it again: Several, I doubt not, of the impartial, who choſe to be active, actively condemned; and enemies, of courſe, rejoiced in an opportunity of joining them.</p>
            <p>No opportunity could be fairer. The Play was, at leaſt, a full hour too long; and had
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0072801100:17"/>
               <hi>Job</hi> himſelf ſat to hear it he muſt have loſt his patience. But, if, gentle reader, thou poſſeſſeſt <hi>Job's</hi> quality, and haſt followed me thus far, in my Narrative, it will appear to thee (for I doubt not thy retention and combination) that I was unable to curtail it effectually, at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time—the laſt rehearſals. I was, then, laid flat, my dear friend, as you remember I have told you, by a fever. The Acting Manager did attend the laſt rehearſals, and ſuffered the piece to be produced, <hi>uncut,</hi> to "drag its ſlow length along" ſurcharged with all his own incapacity, and all his opium.</p>
            <p>How, then, do I ſtand indebted, according to the articles of this night's ſtatement? I owe to Mr. KEMBLE,

            <p>This account is ſomewhat like the Tavern bill, picked from Falſtaff's pocket, when he is ſnorting behind the arras. There is but one halfpenny worth of compaſſion to this intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deal of blame.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſequel.—I have ſhewn, I think, that Mr. KEMBLE, in the firſt inſtance, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took a duty which he <hi>could</hi> not perform: I have now to affirm, with all the difficulty of proving a negative full in my face, that he afterwards, made a mockery of diſcharging a duty which he <hi>would</hi> not perform.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0072801100:18"/>After a week's interval, to give him time to recruit his ſtrength; and the Author time to curtail, and alter, the Play; (for the impreſſion which the Miſ-Manager and Actor, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to ſtamp rendered alteration neceſſary) it was a ſecond time repreſented.</p>
            <p>I muſt, here, let the uninformed reader into a ſecret;—but I muſt go to Newmarket to make him underſtand me.—No, Epſom will do as well; and that is nearer home.—It often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, at a Race, that a known Horſe, from whom good ſport is expected, diſappoints the crowd by <hi>walking over the courſe.</hi>—He does not miſs an inch of the ground; but affords not one jot of diverſion, unleſs ſome pleaſure is received in contemplating his figure. Now, an actor can do the very ſame thing. He can <hi>walk over his part:</hi> He can miſs no more of his words than the Horſe does of his way: he can be as dull, and as tedious, and as good-looking as the Horſe in his progreſs:—The only difference between the two animals is,—that the Horſe brings in him who bets upon him a gainer; but the luckleſs wight who has a large ſtake depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the actor is, decidedly, certain to loſe. There is a trick, too, that the Jockies practiſe, which is called, I think, <hi>playing booty.</hi> This conſiſts in appearing to uſe their utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reach the winning-poſt firſt, when they are already determined to come in the laſt. The conſequence is, that all, except the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones, attribute no fault to the Jockey, but damn the Horſe for a ſluggard.—An actor can <hi>play booty</hi> if he chuſes:—he can pretend to whip and ſpur, and do his beſt, when the Connoiſſeur knows, all the while, he is ſhirking:—but
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:0072801100:19"/>
Sluggard is the unmerited appellation given by the majority to the innocent author..</p>
            <p>Mr. KEMBLE chiefly choſe to be Horſe, and <hi>walked over the ground.</hi> Every now and then (but ſcarcely enough to ſave appearances) he gave a ſlight touch of the Jockey, and <hi>played booty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the language which is put into the mouth of <hi>Sir Edward Mortimer</hi> be above mediocrity, or below contempt, is not to the preſent purpoſe: but the words he is made to utter certainly convey a meaning; and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the ſcenes afford an opportunity to the Performer of playing off his mimick emotions, his tranſitions of paſſion, his ſtarts, and all the trickeries of his trade. The devil a trick did Mr. KEMBLE play but a very ſcurvy one! His emotions and paſſions were ſo rare, and ſo feeble, that they ſeaſoned his general inſipidity, like a ſingle grain of wretched pepper thrown into the largeſt doſe of water-gruel that ever was adminiſtered to an invalid. For the moſt part, he toiled on, line after line, in a dull current of undiverſified ſound, which ſtole upon the ear far more drowſily than the diſtant mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings of Lethe; with no attempt to break the lulling ſtream, or check its ſleep-inviting courſe.</p>
            <p>Frogs in a marſh, flies in a bottle; wind in a crevice, a preacher in a field, the drone of a bagpipe, all, all yielded to the inimitable, and ſoporific monotony of Mr. KEMBLE!</p>
            <p>The very beſt Dramatick writing, where paſſion is expreſſed, if delivered languidly by the Actor, will fail in it's intended effect: and I will be bold enough to ſay that were the <hi>Curſe in King Lear</hi> new to an audience, and they heard
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:0072801100:20"/>
it uttered, for the firſt time, in a croak, fainter than a crow's in a conſumption, it would paſs unnoticed, or appear vapid to the million.</p>
            <p>If I raiſe a critical clatter about my ears, by this aſſertion, which ſome may twiſt into a profanation of Shakſpeare, I leave it to Horace, who can fight battles better than I, to defend me.</p>

            </q>
            <p>That Mr. KEMBLE did not miſconceive the Part is certain; for he told me, ſome time before the Play was acted, that he feared the exertions requiſite, in <hi>Sir Edward Mortimer,</hi> would ſtrain his lungs more than <hi>Octavian,</hi> in the <hi>Mountaineers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he can ſtrain his lungs, to good purpoſe, in <hi>Octavian,</hi> is well known; and, after this, his own intimation, how will he eſcape the charge of wilful and direct delinquency, when, with ſuch a conception of the Part, and with health recovered, he came forward in the true ſpirit of <hi>Bottom,</hi> and <hi>"aggravated his voice ſo that he roared you as gentle as any ſucking dove?"</hi>

            <p>He inſulted the Town, and injured his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployer, and the Author, ſufficiently in the firſt inſtance: in the ſecond he added to the inſult and injury an hundred-fold: and as often as he mangled the Character (three or four times, I am uncertain which, after the firſt night's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance) he heaped aggravation upon aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:0072801100:21"/>The moſt miſerable mummer, that ever diſgraced the walls of a Theatre, could not have been a ſtronger drawback than Mr. KEMBLE.— He was not only dull in himſelf, but the cauſe of dulneſs in others. Like the baleful <hi>Upas of Java,</hi> his peſtiferous influence infected all around him. When two Actors come forward, to keep up the Shuttle cock of ſcenick-fiction, if one plays ſlovenly, the other cannot maintain his game. Poor BANNISTER, Jun. would he ſpeak out (but I have never preſſed him, and never ſhall preſs him to ſay a word upon the ſubject) could bear ample teſtimony to the truth of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.

Miſs FARREN, too, who might animate any thing but a ſoul of lead, and a face of iron, experienced the ſame fate.</p>
            <p>I could proceed, and argue, and reaſon, and diſcuſs, and tire the reader, as I have tired my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (it is now, my good friend, one o'clock in the morning) to prove, further, that Mr. KEMBLE was unſound in my cauſe, and that he ruined my Play:—But I will deſiſt here.

            <p>They who are experienced in <hi>Dramaticks</hi> will, I truſt, ſee that I have made a fair <hi>extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of myſelf—they who are impartial will, I hope, be convinced that I have ſet down <hi>nought in malice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only queſtion that may ariſe to ſhake, materially, the credit of all I have ſaid, is—
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:0072801100:22"/>
"How is it probable that Mr. KEMBLE ſhould injure you thus, without provocation? Is it in nature? Is it in man?" I can merely anſwer that I am unconſcious of having given him cauſe for provocation; that if I have given him cauſe, he has taken a bad mode of revenge; that Mr. KEMBLE's nature has frequently puzzled me in my obſervation upon it; and that I think him a very <hi>extraordinary man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let him take this with him, ſhould this crudely written Preface ever fall in his way. I have committed it to paper <hi>currente calamo.</hi> I mean no alluſion, no epithet, to apply to him as a private individual. As a private individual I give him not that notice which it might, here, be impertinent to beſtow:—but I have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right to diſcuſs his merits, or demerits, in his publick capacities of Manager and Actor: and my cauſe of complaint gives me a good reaſon as well as right. His want of conduct, his neglect, his injuſtice, his oppreſſion, his fineſſe, his perſon, his face, are in this point of view all open to my animadverſion.</p>

            <p>I AM indebted for the ground-work of this Play to a Novel entitled <hi>"Things as they are, or the Adventures of Caleb Williams; written by William Godwin."</hi> Much of Mr. GODWIN's ſtory I have omitted; much, which I have adopted, I have compreſſed; much I have added; and much I have taken the liberty to alter.</p>
            <p>All this I did that I might fit it, in the beſt of my judgment, to the ſtage.</p>
            <p>I have cautiouſly avoided all tendency to that which, vulgarly, (and wrongly, in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) is termed Politicks; with which, many have told me, <hi>Caleb Williams</hi> teems.</p>
            <p>The ſtage has, now, no buſineſs with Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: and, ſhould a Dramatick Author en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to dabble in them, it is the Lord Chamberlain's office to check his attempts, before they meet the eye of the Publick. I peruſed Mr. GODWIN's book, as a tale replete with intereſting incident, ingenious in its arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

maſterly in its delineation of character, and forcible in its language. I conſidered it as right of Common; and, by a title which cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom has given to Dramatiſts, I encloſed it within my theatrical paling. However I may have tilled the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To all the Performers (excepting Mr. KEMBLE) I offer my hearty thanks for their exertions; which would have ſerved me more, had not an actor, <hi>"dark as Erebus,"</hi> caſt a gloom upon them, which none of their efforts, however brilliant, could entirely diſperſe.</p>
            <p>But this does not diminiſh my obligations to them:—ſo much, indeed, I owe to them, that, when the Play was laſt performed, it was riſing, ſpite of <hi>Erebus,</hi> in favour with the Town. It was, then, advertiſed, day after day, at the bottom of the Play-bills, for repetition, till the promiſſory advertiſement became laughable; and, at length, the Advertiſement and the Play were dropt together.</p>
            <p>If, after the foregoing Preface, I ſhould at a future period, bring the Play forward in the Hay-market Theatre, I am fully aware of the numbers who from party and pique, may now oppoſe it. I am aware, too, of the weight which a firſt impreſſion leaves upon the minds of the moſt candid:—Still, ſo ſtrong is my confidence in the genuine deciſion of a London audience, who have a fair opportunity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing their judgment and feelings, (which they have not had, yet, in reſpect to this Play) that I believe I ſhall venture an appeal.</p>
            <p>The Piece is, now, printed as it was acted on the <hi>firſt night</hi>; that they who peruſe it may
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:0072801100:25"/>
decide whether, even in that ſhape, (with all the misfortunes, before enumerated, with which it was doomed to ſtruggle) it ſhould be, for ever, conſigned to moulder on the ſhelf.</p>
            <p>The Songs, Duets, and Choruſſes, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended merely as vehicles for muſical effect. Some criticks have pompouſly called them <hi>Lyrick Poetry</hi>—that by raiſing them to dignity they may more effectually degrade them: as men lift a ſtone very high, before they let it fall, when they would completely daſh it to pieces.</p>
            <p>I, now, leave the gentle reader to the peruſal of the Play—and, leſt my Father's memory may be injured by miſtakes; and, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of after-times, the <hi>Tranſlator of Terence,</hi> and the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>The Jealous Wife,</hi> be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed guilty of the <hi>Iron Cheſt</hi>; I ſhall, were I to reach the Patriarchal longevity of Methuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leh, continue (in all my Dramatick publications) to ſubſcribe myſelf</p>

                  <p>'Tis not my method, friend, of doſing a patient. Look ye, Gilbert; Her mind is a fair flower, ſtuck in the rude ſoil, here, of ſurrounding ignorance, and ſmiling in the chill of poverty:— I would feign cheer it with the little ſun-ſhine I poſſeſs of comfort and information. My parents were poor like her's; Should occaſion ſerve, I might, haply, were all parties agreed, make her my wife. To offer aught elſe would affect her, you, and myſelf; and I have no talent at making three people uneaſy at the ſame time.</p>

                  <p>Harkye—he is my maſter. I owe him my gratitude;—every thing:—and had you been any but my Barbara's father, and ſpoken ſo much againſt him, my indignation had work'd into my knuckles, and cram'd the words down your ruſty throat.</p>

                  <speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis his way;—but he would not have it mention'd. He is one of thoſe judges who, in their office, will never warp the law to ſave offenders; but his private charity bids him aſſiſt the needy, before their neceſſities drive them to crimes which his public duty muſt puniſh.</p>

                  <p>I tell thee, then, our good Sir Edward was beloved in Kent, where he had returned a year before from his travels. Madam Helen's uncle was hated by all the neighbourhood, rich and poor. A mere brute, doſt mark me.</p>

                  <speaker>Wilf.</speaker>

                  <p>Go to, you fire-brand! Our good maſter labour'd all he could, for many a month, to ſoothe his turbulence; but in vain. He pick'd a quarrel with Sir Edward, in the publick county aſſembly; nay, the ſtrong ruffian ſtruck him down, and trampled on him. Think on that, Wilford; on our good maſter Sir Edward, whoſe great ſoul was nigh to burſt with the indignity.</p>

                  <speaker>Wint.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, our young maſter took horſe, for his own houſe, determined, as it appear'd, to ſend a challenge to this white-liver'd giant in the morning.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wilf.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſee. He kill'd him in a duel. That's another kind of butchery, which the law allows not; true humanity ſhudders at, and falſe honour juſtifies.</p>

                  <p>See, now, how you fly off! Sir Edward's revenge, boy, was baffled. For his antagoniſt was found dead in the ſtreet, that night; killed, by ſome unknown aſſaſſins, on his return from the aſſembly.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0072801100:47"/>
I told you, at the next aſſize. Mercy on me! 'twas a crowded court; and both gentle and ſimple threw up their caps, at his acquital! Heaven be thank'd! he was cleared beyond a ſhadow of doubt.</p>

                  <p>The more fatherly in him, madam, to give his ſon what he has need of, for himſelf. But a knave is often applied to, to vouch for a good ſervant's honeſty. I will ſerve you as faithfully as your laſt footman; who, I have heard, ran away this morning.</p>

                  <p>I would Sir Edward were come! The dread of a fearful encounter is, often, as terrible as the encounter itſelf. Yet my encounters with him, of late, are no trifles. Some few hours back, in this very room, he held a loaded piſtol within an inch of my brains. Well, that was paſſion—he threw it from him on the inſtant, and—eh!—He's coming.— No. The old wainſcot cracks, and frightens me out of my wits: and, I verily believe, the great folio dropt on my head, juſt now, from the ſhelf, on purpoſe to encreaſe my terrors.</p>

                  <p>What Wilford, ſit?—my poor—O, ſir, my heart is burſting! I pray you, pardon me. Had he paſs'd our cottage in his flight, I would have ran out, and follow'd him all the world over.</p>

                  <p>Beſeech you, forgive me, ſir! I only came to make enquiry, for I had heard a ſtrange tale. I would not have my ſorrows make me troubleſome to your worſhip.</p>

                  <p>Peace, peace, I pray you. Our maſter is taken ill: So ill, my fellows, that I fear me he ſtands in much danger. That you rejoice in my acquittal, I perceive, and thank you. Sir Edward's brother will explain further to you: I cannot. But believe this:—Heaven, to whoſe eye the dark move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of guilt are manifeſt, will ever watch over,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0072801100:122"/>
and ſuccour the innocent, in their extremity. Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour not now your congratulations to me, I entreat you: Rather, let the ſlow, ſtill voice of gratitude be lifted up to Providence, for that care ſhe ever beſtows upon thoſe deſerving her protection!</p>
