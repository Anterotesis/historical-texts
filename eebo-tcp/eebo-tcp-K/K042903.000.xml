            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>EVERY act, ſays goodman Delver, hath three branches: 'It is to <hi>act,</hi> to <hi>do,</hi> and to <hi>perform</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Hamlet.</note>.'—Contemptible as this piece of caſuiſtry may be deemed; certain it is, that our honeſt grave-digger was not miſtaken in the <hi>number</hi> of thoſe diſtinctions, which are neceſſary to the inveſtigation of moral merit. He was not ſo happy, indeed, in his ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the parts to be diſtinguiſhed. His logic, however, may paſs, if we conceive the <hi>firſt</hi> part of his diviſion to comprehend the deſign or intent of the act; the <hi>ſecond</hi> the manner of putting it in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; and the <hi>third,</hi> the effects or conſequences produced by it.</p>
            <p>Thus, in apologizing for the preſent <hi>Review,</hi> there are three things to be conſidered. 1. The deſign or intent of writing it. 2. The manner in which it is
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0047702200:3"/>
written; and <hi>laſtly,</hi> the probable effects or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that will enſue.</p>
            <p>In reſpect to the former; the Reviewer begs leave to expreſs his motives for writing in the words of an ingenious author, who ſtood exactly in the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament.
<q>I thought it a piece of juſtice due to the memory of Shakeſpeare, to the reputation of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in general, and of our Engliſh language in particular, to take ſome public notice of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, which, I am ſorry to ſay, hath violated all theſe reſpects. Had this been done by a common hand, I had held my peace; and left the work to that oblivion, which it deſerves: but when it came out under the ſanction of a great name, that of a gentleman, who had by other writings, how juſtly I ſhall not [<hi>now</hi>] examine, obtained a great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for learning; it became an affair of ſome conſequence; as chimerical conjectures and groſs miſtakes might by theſe means be propagated for truth among the ignorant and unwary; and that be eſtabliſhed for the genuine text, nay, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine text amended too, which is neither Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare's nor Engliſh <note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix to the Canons of Criticiſm.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such being the motives of action, the intent and deſign of the act is plainly what is ſet forth in the title, viz. to defend the text of Shakeſpeare from the <hi>perſecution</hi> of his commentators.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0047702200:4"/>The Reviewer is well aware that Dr. Johnſon's ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency may ſuggeſt a more ſiniſter view. For, he doubts not, that gentleman <hi>thinks</hi> of himſelf, what he has <hi>ſaid</hi> of Dr. Warburton, that he has
<q>a name ſufficient to confer celebrity on thoſe who can exalt themſelves into antagoniſts;</q>
and hence he may poſſibly impute the preſent work to the motive which he inſinuates to have actuated the opponents of that writer. The alluſion, alſo, of the eagle and owl, which he quotes from Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, may, with a very little latitude of conſtruction, be applied as well to himſelf and the Reviewer, as to Dr. Warburton and his antagoniſt.</p>
            <p>'An Eagle, tow'ring in his pride of place,</p>
            <p>'Was, by a mouſing owl, hawk'd at and kill'd <note n="†" place="bottom">See Dr. Johnſon's preface to his edition of Shakeſpeare.</note>.' For tho', Dr. Johnſon having neither preferment in the church, nor poſt in the ſtate, the word <hi>place</hi> may ſeem to want that ſtrict propriety the critics require; yet, if we reflect how nearly <hi>places</hi> and <hi>penſions</hi> are allied, there is not one of Shakeſpeare's commentators who would make any ſcruple of ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting one word for the other, reciprocally, and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, as he thought the caſe might require. There is no doubt alſo that, on this occaſion, the word penſion would be preferred; as a penſion muſt be univerſally allowed, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> to be better than a place, to a man ſo fond of doing but little; as it is apprehended the reader will think is the caſe with Dr. Johnſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0047702200:5"/>To invalidate, however, the force of ſuch a ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, the Reviewer is reduced to the neceſſity of apparently boaſting, that, in this reſpect, he does not lie under the diſadvantage of being exactly in the ſame ſituation with the author of the Canons of Criticiſm; who frankly confeſſes, that it was the <hi>firſt,</hi> as it was the <hi>only</hi> book he wrote in his life. Dr. Johnſon indeed may, in all probability, have never before heard the name of the preſent writer. He hath nevertheleſs ſome little literary reputation to loſe; which he would not unadviſedly or wantonly put to the hazard.</p>
            <p>This long-expected edition of Shakeſpeare is not the firſt work, by many, that he hath <hi>reviewed,</hi> nor is this Review the only book he hath written: For, tho' the name of Dr. Johnſon is much better known than the merit of his writings, his Reviewer, on the contrary, hath hitherto choſen rather to have the merit of his writings known than his name. The publication of the one is of conſequence to the world, that of the other of none but to the writer; with whoſe perſonal importance or inſignificance the public have nothing to do <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>In confirmation of what is here aſſerted, it may poſſibly be thought neceſſary to name ſome of thoſe publications, on which the public have conferred the honour of a favourable reception.—It is preſumed needleſs, however, to particularize performances that would certainly have been leſs faulty, had they been leſs nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous. The author contents himſelf, therefore, with mentioning only his Epiſtles to Lorenzo; and the Tranſlations of Rouſſeau's Eloiſa, and Emilius.</p>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0047702200:6"/>With regard to the <hi>ſecond</hi> diviſion of our prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſermon, reſpecting the manner in which this Review is written; the author can readily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, that he ſhall be thought to have treated both Dr. Johnſon and Dr. Warburton with an ill-becoming levity, if not with unmerited ſeverity: at leaſt, this he conceives will be the opinion of thoſe, whom an innate conſciouſneſs of their own weakneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires with a <hi>timidity,</hi> which they miſcall, and flatter themſelves to be, CANDOUR. The Reviewer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes indeed he ſhould have been glad to have had, on this occaſion, leſs to do with the commentary of the reverend gentleman laſt mentioned. And this, he hath reaſon to think, would have been the caſe, had not Dr. Johnſon been prevailed on by his printer pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially to cancel ſeveral annotations, in which he had ſtrongly expreſſed his diſſent from that learned ſcholiaſt. But having, on ſecond thoughts, judged it expedient to ſhelter himſelf, as it were, under the wing of the biſhop of Glouceſter; it is hoped the juſtice due to Shakeſpeare will excuſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewer, tho' he ſhould be ſometimes obliged, in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting his preſent editor, to ruffle and expoſe an irreverend feather or two of the Biſhop's.</p>
            <p>That he may not be ſuſpected, however, of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to injure either, from a principle of ſpleen or reſentment, he can ſafely aver, with regard to both, what another of Dr. Warburton's antagoniſts hath declared in reſpect to him alone; i. e.
<q>That
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0047702200:7"/>
he is perſonally a ſtranger to either of theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; never converſed with them; never ſaw them [<hi>but once</hi>]; never had the leaſt communication with them of any kind; never hath received or ſolicited any favour from either; nor, on the other hand, hath been ever perſonally diſobliged by them; ſo that it is impoſſible this proceeding can have been influenced either by diſappointment or reſentment. The truth is, that the Reviewer hath always underſtood it to be an eſtabliſhed law in the republic of letters, wiſely calculated to reſtrain the exceſſes of inſult, petulance and ill-nature, too apt to ſhoot up in the ſplenetic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of ſolitary literature, that every writer ſhould be treated on the ſame foot of civility, on which, when unprovoked by prior ill uſage, he hath been accuſtomed to treat others <note n="*" place="bottom">See the preface to the <hi>Reviſal of Shakeſpeare's text.</hi>
                  </note>.</q>
Now, whether he he hath treated either of theſe gentlemen worſe than they have treated Shakeſpeare, he dares appeal to the impartiality of the public; which, at whatever low eſtimation it may rate an obſcure author, who hath never ſet his name to a book; it will hardly think there can be a greater difference between <hi>him</hi> and this <hi>par nobile fratrum</hi> of commentators, than there is between them and the inimitable writer on whoſe works they have ſo freely commented. If the Reviewer hath at any time, indeed, behaved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theſe gentlemen with <hi>little</hi> ceremony, it hath been always when they deſerved much <hi>leſs:</hi> for it is
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0047702200:8"/>
to be obſerved, he had nothing to do with the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical characters of either. He did not think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, therefore, to pay any deference to Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as his majeſty's penſioner; nor to Dr. Warbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, as biſhop of Glouceſter. Their literary cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter was all that concerned him; and even, viewing them in this light, he had to reſpect them only as commentators on Shakeſpeare.—</p>
            <p>Not that the Reviewer piques himſelf on being deficient in point of civility, or would take upon himſelf to infringe the neceſſary forms of decency and decorum. He admits, as Dr. Johnſon obſerves,
<q>that reſpect is due to high place, and tenderneſs for living reputation:</q>
but then he conceives that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to be limited both as to place and time; and cannot admit that any tenderneſs for the Living gives us a right to trample inhumanly and ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly on the Dead.</p>
            <p>Had the Biſhop of Glouceſter, when he entered on that right-reverend function, made a public recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the errors of poetry, and formally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the pomps and vanities of verbal criticiſm; not one of the hereſies he maintained, or the ſins he committed in this kind, abſurd and enormous as they were, ſhould, with the Reviewer's conſent, have riſen up in judgment againſt him; or have been dragged from that oblivion, to which they ſeemed eternally conſigned. But if either Dr. Warburton, or his friends, preſume on the influence of lawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleeves
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0047702200:9"/>
in the republic of letters, it is proper to inform them there are neither Biſhops, Prieſts nor Deacons in that community. The republic of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is a perfect democracy, where, all being equal, there is no reſpect of perſons, but every one hath a right to ſpeak the truth of another, to cenſure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear, and to commend without favour or affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nor is the <hi>literary</hi> community of leſs dignity than the <hi>political.</hi> Popularity and influence, indeed, may be obtained, for a while, by ſiniſter means in both; but though birth and wealth may confer eminence and power in the one, not the deſcent of an Alexander, nor the riches of Croeſus, confer prerogative or authority in the other.</p>
            <p>In the primitive ſtate of ſociety, a ſuperiority of intellectual abilities was the foundation of all civil pre-eminence; and hence the ſceptre continued to be ſwayed by ſuperior wiſdom through a ſucceſſion of ages. The acquiſitions of ſcience and learning were held among the ancients, in no leſs eſteem than thoſe of conqueſt, and in as much greater than the poſſeſſions of royalty, as a chaplet of laurel was preferred to a coronet of mere gems and gold. Xenophon reaped more honour from his Cyropaedia, than from the famous retreat of the ten thouſand; and Caeſar ſtill more from his commentary, than from all the military exploits recorded in it. As to the examples of modern times; to ſay nothing of James and Chriſtina, leſt it be objected that one was a weak man, and the other a fooliſh woman, we have
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0047702200:10"/>
ſeen the kings of Pruſſia and of Poland, the Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander and the Neſtor of our age, ambitious to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come authors, and be made denizons of our little ſtate. Frederick hath been more than once heard to ſay, he would give his crown, and Staniſlaus, if he had not loſt it, would have given another, to poſſeſs the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entific fame of Leibnitz, or the literary reputation of Voltaire.</p>
            <p>Is it, by the way, then, to be wondered at, that a private individual, like Samuel Johnſon, ſhould be even prepoſterouſly elated at finding that homage paid to him, which has been in vain ſolicited by ſovereigns, and is refuſed even to the King on his throne? Graduated by univerſities, penſioned by his prince, and ſurrounded by pedagogues and poetaſters, he finds a grateful odour in the incenſe of adulation; while admiring bookſellers ſtand at a diſtance, and look up to him with awful reverence, bowing the knee to Baal, and holding in fearful remembrance the exemplary fate of Tom Oſborne; preſumptuous Tom Oſborne! who, braving the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of this paper-crowned idol, was, for his teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, transfixed to his mother-earth by a thundering folio! It may be a pity to diſturb Dr. Johnſon from ſo pleaſing a reverie, and to diſſipate ſo agreeable a ſcene of deluſion; he will exclaim doubtleſs, with the honeſt citizen of Argos.
<q>
                  <l>Pol me occidiſtis—</l>
                  <l>—cui ſic extorta voluptas,</l>
                  <l>Et demptus per vim mentis gratiſſimus error.</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0047702200:11"/>
But, if the intereſts of our literary ſtate require it, it cannot be doubted that the mere gratification of an individual ought to be given up for the good of the whole community.</p>
            <p>But to proceed to the <hi>third</hi> and laſt head of our diſcourſe: the object of which is the effects or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of the following Review. Theſe, like the ſubject of our preface, may be divided alſo into three parts. In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, it is preſumed the injuries done to the name of Shakeſpeare will be in a great meaſure repaired, and the luſtre of his tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed honour reſtored. In the <hi>ſecond,</hi> it is feared Dr. Johnſon will ſuffer not a little in his literary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; and in the <hi>laſt,</hi> it may be ſuſpected, that the proprietors will be injured in the ſale of the work.</p>
            <p>In regard to the <hi>firſt</hi>; the pleaſure, which it is preſumed every true Engliſhman will feel, at the attempt to do juſtice to his favourite poet, will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently exculpate the author, had it been neceſſary to practiſe a ſtill greater ſeverity in effecting it.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> it may not be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the writer to offer ſomething in his juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is not eaſy to gueſs how far Dr. Johnſon would have the <hi>reſpect due to living reputation</hi> extend, when applied to himſelf. He may poſſibly have adopted the opinion of Wolfius, and will plead the authority of that great civilian, to prove that men

of letters ought not to detract from the <hi>unmerited</hi> reputation of others. <hi>Nemo eruditorum alterius famae ac laudi, ſive meritae, ſive</hi> IMMERITAE <hi>detrahere debet.</hi> In reply to this, however, Mr. de Vattel, a civilian of equal authority, though perhaps of ſomewhat leſs note, takes a different ſide of the queſtion; affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that no perſon hath a juſt complaint, becauſe we may deprive him of a thing to which he hath no right, and which he unjuſtly aſſumes to himſelf. On the other hand, he determines that the literary reputation which is gotten undeſervedly, is injurious to men of true merit; who thus become ſufferers by the Vain and Undeſerving. When praiſe, continues this able civilian, is proſtituted on unworthy objects, it loſes its value: the world grows diſtruſtful, and in conſequence of being made the dupe of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, frequently refuſes to beſtow its applauſe on the truly Meritorious. Ought we to contribute to this injuſtice, for fear of depriving an impoſtor of the reputation on which he plumes himſelf, and to which he hath no well-founded pretenſions? Surely not! Such is the reaſoning of de Vattel on this intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing point; how far it is applicable to any, or all the editors of Shakeſpeare, the public is to determine. It is ſufficient that the Reviewer hath the civil law at leaſt on his ſide, in his endeavours to do juſtice to merit; though he ſhould be found to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, more in effect than with deſign, from the reputation of the Undeſerving. His conſcience is perfectly eaſy alſo, from the reflection that if he had not undertaken to expoſe the defects of Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0047702200:13"/>
work, ſomebody elſe would. For, as Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards juſtly obſerves,
<q>the world will not long be impoſed on by ungrounded pretences to learning, or any other qualification; nor does the knowledge of words alone, <hi>if it be really attained,</hi> make a man learned. Every true judge, as he obſerves, will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to Scaliger's opinion;</q>
               <q>If, ſays that great Critic, a perſon's learning is to be judged of by his reading, no body can deny Euſebius the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a learned man; but if he is to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed learned, who has ſhewn judgment together with his reading, Euſebius is not ſuch.</q>
To this it may be truly added, in the words of another author, from whom this writer alſo borrowed them, as he uſed them on a ſimilar occaſion;
<q>It is not the purpoſe of the following remarks, to caſt a blemiſh on his [Dr. Johnſon's] envied fame; but to do a piece of juſtice to the real merit of the <hi>comment</hi> and the <hi>commentator</hi>; by that beſt and gentleſt method of correction, which nature has ordained in ſuch a caſe; of <hi>laughing them down</hi> to their proper rank and character.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to the laſt point, viz. the intereſt of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors; the Reviewer thinks it very problematical whether this will be affected either way. He hath indeed known books ſometimes ſell the better for being publicly cenſured: but, be this as it may, he can truly aver that he meant them no harm; for, though it is poſſible that one or other of them may have ſometimes failed a little in that reſpect to the writer, which he thinks an author has a right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0047702200:14"/>
of his bookſeller, and his bookſeller, if he is wiſe, will be ready to pay him, yet he does not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſo much reſentment againſt any of them, as to wiſh to hurt their intereſt. If unluckily it ſhould turn out, however, that the ſale of Dr. Johnſon's edition of Shakeſpeare ſhould be hence obſtructed, and that it ſhould only <hi>hobble,</hi> inſtead of taking a <hi>run</hi>; the proprietors have nothing to do, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Reviewer, if they can, or ſome body elſe, to furniſh them with a better edition. Nor will this be a difficult taſk, although it would be an arduous and noble one, to give the public ſuch a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary as the writings of this incomparable Bard de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
            <p>To detain the reader but a moment longer.—Dr. Johnſon, having acted, in the outrage he hath committed on Shakeſpeare, juſt like other ſinners, not only by doing thoſe things he ought not to have done, but by leaving undone thoſe things he ought to have done; his ſins of omiſſion are not leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, though much more numerous, than thoſe of commiſſion. Indeed, nothing is more uſual with commentators in general, than to diſplay their own ſagacity on obvious paſſages, and to leave the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult ones to be explained by the ſagacity of their readers <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Dr. Johnſon, indeed, ſays, in his Preface:
<q>Not a ſingle paſſage in the whole work has appeared to me corrupt, which I have not attempted to reſtore; or obſcure, which I have not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to illuſtrate.</q>
How he hath ſucceeded in theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, the reader is left to judge for himſelf on peruſal of the following ſheets.</p>

here to have given a compleat commentary himſelf; indeed he hath been able only to include in the following ſheets ſome few remarks on the moſt glaring blunders and defects that occur in this new edition; of which ſuch wonderful things were promiſed and expected; and to which, having ſeen the prophecy fulfilled, we may apply, with as much juſtice as ever it was applied to any thing, that well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known quotation from Horace.</p>

                  <p>This paſſage hath raiſed much contention among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators; though it is authorized, it ſeems, by the old edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Dr. Johnſon, however, ſays
<q>it is apparently defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Mr. Rowe (continues he) and Dr. Warburton, read <hi>that there is no ſoul loſt,</hi> without any notice of the variation. Mr. Theobald ſubſtitutes <hi>no foil</hi>; and Mr. Pope follows him. To come ſo near the right, and yet to miſs it, is unlucky; the author probably wrote <hi>no ſoil,</hi> no ſtain, no ſpot: for ſo Ariel tells,
<q>
                           <l>Not a hair periſh'd;</l>
                           <l>On their ſuſtaining garments not a blemiſh,</l>

                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0047702200:17"/>
And Gonzalo—<hi>The rarity of it is, that our garments being drenched in the ſea, keep notwithſtanding their freſhneſs and gloſſes.</hi> Of this emendation I find that the author of Notes on the Tempeſt had a glimpſe, but could not keep it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. Theobald is treated with no little ſeverity in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the preſent editor, for pluming himſelf on his critical pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration in making ſome diſcoveries that have eſcaped others. Dr. Johnſon, however, gives himſelf an air of ſuperiority in the above note, as exceptionable at leaſt as any of Theobald's; as will appear on the ſlighteſt attention to the conſtruction of the ſentence; this pretended emendation, however plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſupported, being in fact entirely groundleſs.—What can we underſtand by NO SOIL BETID <hi>to any creature in the veſſel?</hi> Or if we can with difficulty ſtrain out a meaning, is the ſtile at all like that of Shakeſpeare; whoſe attention to colloquial idiom is ſo cloſe, that our language is more indebted, in this reſpect, to him than to any other writer; I had almoſt ſaid, all other writers put together?—If the paſſage is to be altered, let us at leaſt make <hi>Engliſh</hi> of it: Shakeſpeare very probably wrote ILL; a word eaſily corrupted by the tranſcriber into <hi>ſoul.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>—there is no ILL,</l>
                        <l>No, not ſo much <hi>perdition</hi> as an hair,</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Betid</hi> to any <hi>creature,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
                     </q>
To <hi>betide</hi> is to befal, to happen to, to come to paſs, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of; and would here be very improperly uſed with <hi>ſoil</hi>; for even ſuppoſing there were no impropriety in ſaying a <hi>ſoil</hi> might <hi>betide a ſuit of cloaths:</hi> no idiom will bear a <hi>ſoil betiding to</hi> a <hi>creature,</hi> when its cloathing only was meant.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall we ſay to the ſpeeches of Ariel and Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalo, that ſeem to favour the <hi>emendation</hi> propoſed?—What, indeed, but that they are little or nothing to the purpoſe! The poet was evidently judicious enough to apprehend the ſpectator muſt be offended with the palpable impropriety of bringing on a parcel of people, that had been juſt heartily
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0047702200:18"/>
ſouſed in the ſea, without any apparent <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>For that it was only the external appearance of their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that was preſerved, is evident, from the ſpeeches of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio and Sebaſtian immediately ſucceeding that of Gonzalo. <hi>Our garments,</hi> ſays the latter, <hi>are rather new dy'd than ſtained with ſalt water.</hi> On which Antonio ſays to Sebaſtian,
<q>If but one of his pockets could ſpeak, would it not ſay, he lies?</q>
To which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark Sebaſtian anſwers, "Ay, or very falſely pocket up his report." Thus it does not appear that the <hi>creatures,</hi> the people themſelves, ſuſtained no <hi>ſoil, ſtain,</hi> or <hi>ſpot.</hi> On the contrary, it ſeems by their diſcourſe that they were all in a very pretty pickle, notwithſtanding their fair outſide, which the decency of theatrical repreſentation rendered neceſſary for the poet to beſtow on them.</p>
                     </note> ſoil or ſpot on their cloaths. To prevent him, therefore, from being thus offended on their appearance on the ſtage, Ariel is previouſly made to mention this circumſtance to Proſpero; and in order to reconcile the audience to it when the perſons actually appear, Gonzalo is artfully made to remind them of what had been effected by the miniſtry of Ariel.—There is not the leaſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for telling this to the auditors three times over, or for Proſpero to mention this circumſtance at all to Miranda.—Proſpero had before told her there was no <hi>harm</hi> done: which ſhe thinks very ſtrange; and he proceeds accordingly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain from what cauſe there is no <hi>ill betid</hi> thoſe, of whoſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhe was ſo very apprehenſive, and for whoſe ſafety ſhe was ſo very ſolicitous.

Perhaps the reader will be of my opinion, that the paſſage loſes neither ſenſe, ſpirit, nor propriety by this reſtoration. As Dr. Johnſon tells us in his preface, that he has generally adopted Theobald's notes, unleſs confuted by ſubſequent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notators, it is to be wiſhed he had always given his reaſons for deviating from him in the text.</p>
               </div>

                  <head>Vol. I. Page 17.</head>
                  <p>The note contained in this page is ſo far a good one, as it is neceſſary and proper to give the reader an idea of the ſyſtem of enchantment, on which the plot and machinery of the play is conducted. I ſhould therefore have paſſed it over as unexceptionable, had it come from any other pen than that of Dr. Johnſon. But as the world hath been pleaſed very publickly to impute ſentiments to him, which ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous with thoſe he here profeſſes, I cannot paſs it over without ſome little animadverſion. The incongruity I mean lies here: the Doctor, I have been frequently informed, very religiouſly believes in the exiſtence of ghoſts and appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; although he here ſtrongly inſinuates that there <hi>never</hi> was any ſuch thing practiſed as witchcraft. But if he believes the ſtory of the witch of Endor, and that the ghoſt of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>e of witchcraft, and alſo in its power over de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſpirits. For, though ſome divines maintain that it was the devil who appeared in the form of Samuel, and not the ghoſt of Samuel himſelf; yet, as Dr. Johnſon, in the note before us, adopts the diſtinction made by king James in his demonology, viz. that an <hi>enchanter is one who commands the devil, whereas the witch only ſerves him,</hi> he cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0047702200:20"/>
to ſhelter himſelf under the opinion of thoſe learned theologues. Either Dr. Johnſon therefore muſt give up his faith in apparitions, or retract this part of his note.—But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, perhaps, I may have been miſinformed by the wicked wits of the times; for though it be true they do avouch ſome corroborating circumſtances, and advance ſome plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts, I think I can diſcover ſome fallacy at the bottom. Our editor's favourite, Hooker, it is true, talks of ſpirits diſperſed up and down in caves and dens under the earth; and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may hence be taken to give out, that the viſit Dr. Johnſon once made to a certain cemetery was to confer with ſome of theſe ſpirits. But in this theſe ſuperficial witlings muſt certainly be miſtaken; the ſpirits mentioned by Hooker were ſuppoſed, as is here obſerved, to be fallen angels. Hence, though I ſhould be brought to believe, that our edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor did go from Cock-lane to Clerkenwell, to fulfil an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment with the ghoſt of Fanny, I cannot poſſibly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him of ever going there purpoſely to meet the devil.</p>

But <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> ſeem in this caſe to be ſo much at variance, that I am appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive our editor will go near to be thought authority-mad, at leaſt by many, for making this reſtoration without aſſigning the motive for it. <hi>Madneſs</hi> hath been, with propriety, called <hi>a fever of the mind,</hi> by writers of all ages and countries; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0047702200:21"/>
it is at beſt a pleonaſm, or a piece of tautology, for Ariel to ſay, they played tricks of deſperation, after he had ſaid they were ſeized with madneſs. Perhaps our editor might think there was an impropriety, in ſaying that a <hi>ſoul</hi> felt a fever of the <hi>mind.</hi> But, not to ſtand upon the philoſophical diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that might juſtly be made between the mind and the ſoul, he cannot be ignorant that the word <hi>ſoul</hi> is here uſed in the vulgar and popular ſenſe, as a <hi>man,</hi> a <hi>perſon.</hi> Will he perſiſt in thinking it a ſufficient reaſon for abiding by the old copies, that the tranſcribers and compoſitors could <hi>read?</hi> The ſame plea might be argued for perpetuating a number of blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders committed in the preſent edition. Admitting alſo, after all, that the oldeſt copies are likely to be moſt authentic, and that ſuch reading, if erroneous, could not thus paſs through ſucceſſive editions; yet I will undertake, in behalf of Shakeſpeare, to affirm, that he did not write the above ſentence, as it now ſtands in the text. The commentators on Shakeſpeare are all very liberal in their declarations againſt the ungrammaticalneſs of his ſtile. Now I will not here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, whether he always wrote grammatically or not; but this I will maintain, that he always wrote idiomatically; if he did not always write <hi>grammar,</hi> he always wrote <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I wiſh I could ſay as much for the new-fangled accent-tuners of the preſent age; who, with their quaint and affected pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to refinement and elegance, have ſo vilely corrupted the <hi>idiom</hi> of our tongue. Whoſoever would recover, and ground themſelves in this, muſt ſtudy Shakeſpeare, who, though he might poſſibly write
<q>
                        <l>Not a ſoul</l>
                        <l>But felt <hi>the</hi> fever of the mad,</l>
                     </q>
that is, ſuch a fever as the mad, or as mad-men, feel, I will be bold to ſay, could never in this place write

                        <l>Not a ſoul</l>

for if this means any thing, it muſt mean they caught a fever
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0047702200:22"/>

                        <hi>The ſtrangeneſs</hi>] Why ſhould a wonderful ſtory produce ſleep? I believe experience will prove, that any violent agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the mind eaſily ſubſides in ſlumber, eſpecially when, as in Proſpero's relation, the laſt images are pleaſing.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>In anſwer to the odd queſtion propoſed at the beginning of this note, I have only to ſay, as the editor ſo frequently does, when he meets with difficulties, <hi>I know nothing of the matter.</hi> I have for ſuch a <hi>why</hi> no <hi>wherefore.</hi> Nay, I know not that a wonderful ſtory does produce ſleep; unleſs it follows from a profound obſervation, which poſſibly our editor may have made, that old women and children generally amuſe themſelves with relating wonderful ſtories juſt as they are going to bed. The editor believes, experience will prove that any violent agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind eaſily ſubſides in ſlumber. Now, if he does not mean ſimply by this, that when people are drowſy they cannot be violently agitated, I do believe, on the contrary, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will prove, that no <hi>violent</hi> agitation of the mind <hi>eaſily</hi> ſubſides at all. I have indeed heard of ſomebody's being ſo deſperately in love, as to fall into a profound lethargy; but I believe this too was only on the authority of ſome play-book, and much ſuch another philoſopher as Miranda. But, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the fact to be true, what does the editor mean by aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſtrange a queſtion? or what does he intend by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to it? Does he mean, for the credit of the poet, to account for Miranda's ſleepineſs from natural cauſes? Shakeſpeare is, doubtleſs, much obliged to him; but in this our editor ſeems rather too officious, as the poet hath taken care to inform us, that Proſpero had cauſed it by the power of inchantment: a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance

I wonder the editor ſhould ſo ſoon forget, when he had complimented Dr. Warburton, but two or three <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 14.</note> pages before, on his ſagacity in diſcovering that Proſpero's art-magic had, in this caſe, operated on her like a doſe of liquid lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, and that he had wiſely ſet it to work juſt as he was going to tell her the moſt intereſting ſtory ſhe ever heard in her life.</p>

                     <hi>Urgently</hi> for <hi>ungently.</hi> This is probably an error of the preſs; as, notwithſtanding the inſtance above given of our editor's foiſting in a <hi>thou,</hi> againſt all propriety of meaſure, I think neither the emendation of ſenſe, if any is aimed at, nor even the authority of copies, can juſtify the breach of meaſure here. And indeed, though it ſhould be the miſtake of the printer, an editor, who is employed in <hi>literal</hi> and <hi>verbal</hi> criticiſm, is inexcuſable for not cancelling the page wherein ſuch errors occur. Yet theſe miſtakes ſeem very frequently to happen in the preſent edition; thus, in page 6, Gonzalo is made to ſay
<q>
                        <l>He'll be hang'd yet,</l>
                        <l>Though every drop of water ſwear againſt it,</l>

                     </q>
All the other editions that I have ſeen, read <hi>gape</hi>; but perhaps our editor had ſome objection to a drop of water's <hi>gaping:</hi> but ſurely it might <hi>gape,</hi> and even <hi>ſwallow,</hi> as well as <hi>ſwear.</hi> Or, perhaps, he thought every ſingle drop could never gape wide enough to take down a man-of-war's boatſwain; and therefore choſe to read it quaintly <hi>gap</hi>; meaning that the drops ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from each other, and thereby made a gap for him in the ſea. By <hi>every drop,</hi> however, Shakeſpeare meant all the drops, or the water collectively. After all, it is not unlikely, as our editor has no note on this word, that he did not think
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0047702200:24"/>
at all about it, but left the text to the mercy of the printer.—Poor Shakeſpeare!</p>
                  <p>Again in this very play, page 77. <hi>than</hi> is printed for <hi>that,</hi> and in many other places, both in the text and in the notes, theſe errors occur, to the great injury of the ſenſe; ſo that one might be apt to think this edition (as Dr. Johnſon affirms of the old ones) was AT LAST <hi>printed without correction of the preſs.</hi> It may be very true, as he alſo obſerves, that
<q>before the editor's art was applied to modern languages, our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors were accuſtomed to ſo much negligence of <hi>Engliſh</hi> printers <note n="*" place="bottom">I ſhould refer my readers to the page of the preface, from whence this paſſage is cited; but, behold, ſuch is the accuracy of <hi>modern Britiſh</hi> printers! the preface is not <hi>paged</hi> at all.</note>, that they could very patiently endure it.</q>
But is it not reaſonably to be expected, Dr. Johnſon, that, ſince the editor's art hath been ſo very <hi>ſucceſsfully</hi> applied to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern languages, our printers ſhould be a little more careful in correcting the preſs? or that the editor himſelf ſhould a little attend to this matter?</p>

They knew they muſt be ſomewhere in the Mediterranean. They were neither in the Atlantic ocean, nor the South-ſea, and could not be caſt aſhore on Greenland, nor on Terra Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtralis incognita. And as they found the iſland pleaſant and temperate, and affording 'every thing advantageous to life,' it was no wonder if they did not at all deſpair of ſubſiſting there, till they ſhould find means to get back to Naples, even if their own veſſel and all the fleet were wrecked and gone to the bottom. But, though this annotation doth not ſerve to remove any difficulty, or diſplay any merit in the author, it ſufficiently ſerves to expoſe the incapacity of the annotator, for commenting on Shakeſpeare as a poet. He cannot ſee why Sebaſtian ſhould plot againſt his brother, unleſs he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally knew how to find the kingdom he meant to inherit. But Sebaſtian's plot was <hi>natural,</hi> even ſuppoſing there had been more reaſon for diffidence in this particular. This editor might as well aſk, why the chiefs of the rebellious party, in Henry the fourth, are made to quarrel about the diviſion of the kingdom, before they are maſters of it, and that of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of which they never are maſters? Yet this is one of the fineſt ſcenes in all Shakeſpeare, admirably repreſenting that anticipation of our wiſhes and expectations, which is daily obſervable in men of ſanguine conſtitutions, and is inſeparable from the human mind. We are all too apt to <hi>count our chickens before they are hatched,</hi> and even ſometimes to ſell them too, and ſpend the money; which occaſions the hen to fit ſo long brooding over the eggs, and produce ſo many addled ones at laſt.—'My annotations are no eggs.'—I did not ſay they were, Dr. Johnſon; but <hi>qui capit ille facit.</hi>

                           <l>Profeſſes to perſuade;</l>

of which the meaning may be either that, <hi>He alone, who is a ſpirit of perſuaſion, profeſſes to perſuade the king</hi>; or that, <hi>He only profeſſes to perſuade,</hi> that is, <hi>without being ſo perſuaded himſelf, he makes a ſhow of perſuading the king.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>Dr. Johnſon ſeems here to have gotten <hi>a glimpſe</hi> (as he before ſays of another commentator) of the author's meaning, but <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep it.</hi> I wonder the word <hi>almoſt,</hi> in the preceding line, did not lead him quite into it. There is no neceſſity for altering the text any farther than to tranſpoſe the comma, placed after the word perſuaſion, to the end of the line. The meaning would then be this: <hi>He hath</hi> ALMOST [not quite] <hi>perſuaded the king; for he is the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of perſuaſion only, he profeſſes to perſuade:</hi> that is,
<q>He has only <hi>almoſt</hi> perſuaded the king; for he hath no ſolid argument or weighty reaſon to enforce what he ſays; he hath only the mere volatile <hi>ſpirit</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion; that ſuperficial vapour of words which exhales and carries with it only the appearance, the mere ſhew or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of perſuading.</q>
—Or perhaps the word <hi>ſpirit</hi> is here uſed in a meaning nearly ſimilar, for the mere form, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition, ſemblance; that is, not the body or ſubſtance of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion. But be it as it will, it ſeems that a better ſenſe than either of Dr. Johnſon's, may be <hi>drawn from this entangled ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> without the leaſt alteration of Shakeſpeare's words. For it appears evident, from the opinion that both Antonio and Sebaſtian entertain of the capacity of Gonzalo, that the one would never call him the ſpirit of perſuaſion, as having the

                        <p>It is indeed obſervable that, notwithſtanding Gonzalo talks ſo much, and is, as Antonio ſays, <hi>ſuch a ſpendthrift of his tongue,</hi> yet Franciſco gives the king more ſubſtantial reaſons, in one ſingle ſpeech, for thinking the prince alive, than Gonzalo, with all his prattle.—And yet Alonzo is made to turn a deaf ear to him, with <hi>No, no, he's gone.</hi>

                  <p>The opinions of the commentators are ſtrangely divided about this elegant little ſong. Mr. Theobald reads, in the firſt line, <hi>there lurk I</hi>; obſerving that Ariel was a ſpirit of a refined aethereal eſſence, and could not be intended to want food. Beſides, the ſequent lines rather countenance <hi>lurk.</hi> For my part, I am apt to be of Mr. Theobald's opinion, for another reaſon; and that is, I think Ariel, though he ſhould even be ſuppoſed to have occaſion for more ſubſtantial food than the cameleon; yet he cannot mean to compare himſelf to a bee, or a ſuckling of any kind. Mr. Theobald's read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is alſo more elegant; and yet our editor hath reſtored the old word <hi>ſuck,</hi> without giving any reaſon for it.—A more material alteration hath been attempted on the laſt line; which Mr. Theobald, in his Shakeſpeare Reſtored, conceived ſhould be written, <hi>After ſun-ſet merrily.</hi> This conjecture was countenanced by Mr. Pope, and adopted by Sir Thomas Hanmer: but Dr. Warburton rejected it with infinite diſdain. Dr. Johnſon alſo, having reſtored <hi>ſummer</hi> to the text, and quoted Warburton's note without any animadverſion of his own, muſt be ſuppoſed to acquieſce in the force of what that learned commentator hath advanced; or at leaſt, by his own confeſſion, to have nothing better to offer.—And yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in my opinion, can be more inconcluſive than the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument contained in Dr. Warburton's annotation.—It will be thought, no doubt, a little preſumptuous in ſo petty an Ariſtarchus as myſelf, to attack conjointly two ſuch gigantic and formidable critics. But I could not, with patience, ſee a Goliah treat the muſe of Shakeſpeare like a common drab, at his pleaſure; my weapon, therefore, is quickly out,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0047702200:29"/>
you ſee, for
<q>I dare draw as ſoon as another man, if I ſee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, in a good quarrel, and the law of my ſide.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dr. Warburton's note, as it is quoted by our editor, runs thus:</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>After ſummer, merrily.</hi>] This is the reading of all the editions: yet Mr. Theobald has ſubſtituted ſun-ſet, becauſe Ariel talks of riding on the bat in this expedition. An idle fancy. That circumſtance is given only to deſign the time of night in which fairies travel. One would think the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the circumſtances ſhould have ſet him right. Ariel was a ſpirit of great delicacy, bound, by the charms of Proſpero, to a conſtant attendance on his occaſions. So that he was confined to the iſland winter and ſummer. But the roughneſs of winter is repreſented by Shakeſpeare as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to fairies, and ſuch like delicate ſpirits, who, on this account, conſtantly follow ſummer. Was not this then the moſt agreeable circumſtance of Ariel's new reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered liberty, that he could now avoid winter, and follow ſummer quite round the globe? But, to put the matter out of queſtion, let us conſider the meaning of this line,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>There</hi> I couch <hi>when</hi> owls do cry.</l>
                     </q>
Where? in the <hi>cowſlip's bell</hi> and <hi>where the bee ſucks,</hi> he tells us: this muſt needs be in <hi>ſummer.</hi> When? <hi>when owls cry,</hi> and this is in <hi>winter.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>When blood is nipt, and ways be foul,</l>
                        <l>Then nightly ſings the ſtaring owl.</l>
                        <bibl>LOVE's LABOUR LOST.</bibl>
                     </q>
The conſequence is, that Ariel flies after ſummer.</q>
                  <p>Such is Dr. Warburton's elaborate annotation: in anſwer to which it may be obſerved that, whether Theobald's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning be right or not, his own arguments are egregiouſly wrong. I will admit, with Dr. Warburton, that Ariel here ſpeaks of himſelf as a kind of fairy; but, ſuppoſing no objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be made to the difference of climates, I do not know that Shakeſpeare hath any where repreſented winter ſo exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively diſagreeable to fairies, as to oblige them, like ſwallows,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0047702200:30"/>
to expatriate on the arrival of winter. The argument he makes uſe of, and the quotation he brings to put the matter out of queſtion, are inſufficient, and are invalidated by many other paſſages in Shakeſpeare. He would infer from the two lines, quoted from the ſong in Love's Labour loſt, that owls never cry but in <hi>winter.</hi> But the queen of the fairies, in the Mid-ſummer Night's Dream, ſays to her attendants,
<q>
                        <l>—keep back</l>
                        <l>The clamorous owl, that nightly hoots, and wonders</l>
                        <l>At our quaint Spirits.</l>
                     </q>
And again, Puck, at the latter end of the ſame play, ſays,
<q>
                        <l>Now the waſted brands do glow,</l>
                        <l>Whilſt the ſcritch-owl, ſhrieking loud,</l>
                        <l>Puts the wretch that lies in woe,</l>
                        <l>In remembrance of a ſhroud.</l>
                     </q>
Thus we ſee that the owls do cry, even in the preſence of the fairies. It may not be amiſs alſo to remark, that in the ſong of <hi>Winter,</hi> the owl is repreſented as <hi>ſinging a merry note</hi>; whereas, in the other paſſages, ſhe is ſaid to <hi>cry,</hi> to be <hi>clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:</hi> which it might with great propriety be ſaid to do in ſummer, when her hooting is contraſted
<q>
                        <l>To the night-warbling bird, that now, awake,</l>

A circumſtance that does not operate to the owl's diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the cold and dreary nights of winter, when the ſame hooting may even have ſomething chearful in it; at leaſt to thoſe who are ſitting by a good fire in the chimney-corner: <hi>While greaſy Joan doth keel the pot.</hi> As to what Dr. Warburton ſays about following <hi>ſummer</hi> quite round the globe, I never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard that <hi>ſummer</hi> itſelf went round the globe. That it vibrates from pole to pole is certain: but there is ſome little difference between that motion of the earth which cauſes ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and winter, and that which cauſes day and night.</p>

On the contrary, he appears to execute the commands of Proſpero by day-light. Nor is this inconſiſtent with his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, as a fairy of a ſuperior kind.

                  <p>Dr. Warburton, and our editor, have both attempted to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this paſſage, without ſucceſs. The difficulty lies in the ſixth, ſeventh and eighth lines. Dr. Warburton ſays,
<q>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing what? ſhe did not follow the ſhip, whoſe motion ſhe imitated; for that ſailed on the water, ſhe on the land.

                           <l>Would imitate.</l>

i. e. wantoning in ſport and gaiety. Thus the old Engliſh writers—and they beleeven FOLYLY and <hi>falſely</hi>—ſays Sir J. Mandeville, from and in the ſenſe of <hi>folâtrer,</hi> to play the wanton. This exactly agrees to the action deſcribed.—<hi>full often has ſhe goſſipt by my ſide</hi>—and—<hi>when we have laughed to ſee.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This note, Dr. Johnſon tells us, is very ingenious; but, continues he,
<q>ſince <hi>follying</hi> is a word of which I know not any example; and the fairy's favourite might, without much licentiouſneſs of language, be ſaid to <hi>follow</hi> a ſhip that ſailed in the direction of the coaſt, I think there is no ſufficient reaſon for adopting it. The coinage of new words is a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent remedy, not to be uſed but in the laſt neceſſity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will not diſpute with our editor the ingenuity of Dr. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burton's note, or that of his own; but it is certainly an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of a different kind to that which is neceſſary to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate Shakeſpeare. The former of theſe gentlemen, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, affected to ridicule the bookſellers for believing a ſilly maxim, that none but a <hi>poet ſhould preſume to meddle with a poet.</hi> The event, however, hath proved this maxim to have ſome truth in it. If either Dr. Warburton, or Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, had, in criticiſing this paſſage, exerciſed their ingenuity as poets, inſtead of their ingenuity as philologers, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded they would have ſoon diſcovered its meaning. But they were too intent upon <hi>words,</hi> to attend to the <hi>images</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be conveyed by them. The former talks of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſcribed in two lines, wherein nothing is ſpoken of but <hi>goſſipping</hi> and <hi>laughing.</hi> Do theſe imitate a ſhip under ſail? To have been merely playful and wanton, is not the imitation here mentioned: nor does it conſiſt in merely <hi>following</hi> the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject imitated, as Dr. Johnſon conceives; for ſhe did not only ſail upon land, in the ſame direction along the coaſt as the ſhips did in the ſea; but ſhe <hi>returned</hi> again, which muſt have been in a different direction. So that it appears neither of theſe <hi>ingenious</hi> critics had any idea of the poetical beauty of this paſſage.—I ſhall endeavour to explain it, therefore, by a very
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0047702200:34"/>
different mode of inveſtigation.—If the reader hath ever ſeen a ſhip ſcudding before the wind, with its fore-ſail grown <hi>big-bellied,</hi> as the poet expreſſes it, with the ſwelling breeze; he muſt recollect that, in ſuch a caſe, the ſail projects ſo far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that it ſeems, to a ſpectator on ſhore, to go in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>before</hi> the reſt of the veſſel; which, for the ſame reaſon, appears to <hi>follow,</hi> though cloſely, <hi>after,</hi> with an eaſy, ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming motion.—This was the moving image, which the fairy's favourite, taking the hint from, and the advantage of, her pregnancy, endeavoured to imitate; and this ſhe did, by wantonly diſplaying before her the convexity of her ſwelling belly, and moving after it, as the poet deſcribes,
<q>—with pretty and with ſwimming gate.</q>
Such being the ſenſe of the paſſage, the text is eaſily aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by pointing and reading thus;
<q>
                        <l>Which ſhe, with pretty and with ſwimming gate</l>
                        <l>Following her womb, then rich with my young ſquire,</l>
                        <l>Would imitate.</l>
                     </q>
This is the method a critic ſhould take with the poets. Trace out their images, and you will ſoon find how they expreſſed themſelves, without perplexing yourſelf either about the meaning of antiquated words, or the coinage of new ones.</p>

                  <p>On this paſſage our editor quotes the following note from Dr. Warburton, without animadverſion.
<q>Shakeſpeare could never write this nonſenſe: we ſhould read—<hi>to</hi> REAR <hi>without warning</hi>; i. e. It is no wonder that walls ſhould be ſuddenly down, when they were as ſuddenly up;—REAR'D without warning.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had our editor nothing to offer better than this? And hath he ſo little veneration for Shakeſpeare, as ſo readily to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the charge againſt him of writing nonſenſe? Did you, Dr. Johnſon, ever read the ſcene, wherein this paſſage occurs, quite through? I could almoſt venture to affirm, that neither you nor Dr. Warburton ever could have read it through with any attention. It ſeems to me morally impoſſible, if you had, that <hi>he</hi> could have made ſo egregious a miſtake, or <hi>you</hi> have admitted it among your notes.—Shakeſpeare moſt undoubtedly wrote it HEAR, as it ſtands in the text. For not to inſiſt upon the palpable defects of Dr. Warburton's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, the moſt undoubted evidence in juſtification of this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0047702200:37"/>
reading, may be deduced from the context. In the preceding page the wall makes a ſpeech, on which Theſeus ſays, <hi>Would you deſire lime and hair to ſpeak better?</hi> and Demetrius anſwers, <hi>It is the wittieſt partition that ever I heard diſcourſe.</hi> On this Pyramus enters and cloſes his ſpeech with a curſe againſt the wall. His ſpeech ending with the words <hi>deceiving me.</hi> Upon which Theſeus again thus remarks,
<q>The wall, methinks, being ſenſible, ſhould curſe again.</q>
                     <hi>No,</hi> ſays the actor who play'd Pyramus, <hi>in truth, Sir, he ſhould not.</hi> DECEIVING ME, <hi>is</hi> Thiſbe<hi>'s cue; ſhe is to enter, and I am to ſpy her through the wall. You ſhall ſee, it will fall pat as I told you. Yonder ſhe comes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, Pyramus and Thiſbe having met and ſpied each other through the crevice, for which purpoſe only the wall was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, their interview is no ſooner over than the actor who played the <hi>wall,</hi> apparently, without waiting for his cue, as no body ſpeaks to him, and he ſpeaks to no perſon in the drama, ſays,

<q>This <hi>nonſenſe</hi> muſt be corrected thus; <hi>with ſpecial roll:</hi> i. e. by a ſpecial commiſſion.</q>
The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent editor, Dr. Johnſon, thinks Warburton right in ſuppoſing a corruption, but leſs happy in his emendation. He reads, therefore, with <hi>ſpecial ſeal</hi>; which, he ſays, is a very natural metonymy for a <hi>ſpecial</hi> commiſſion.—But why did not our editor obviate the objection made againſt this ſuppoſition of a corruption, by the author of the Canons of Criticiſm? Was his objection of too little weight, or was the writer of too little conſequence to need a refutation? This author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on this paſſage, that
<q>with ſpecial <hi>ſoul,</hi> may fairly be interpreted to mean, with great thought, upon mature deliberation; but that with ſpecial <hi>roll,</hi> for—by ſpecial <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> is harſh and aukward; and to <hi>elect</hi> a man by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, inſtead of—<hi>appoint</hi> him, is flat <hi>nonſenſe.</hi>
                     </q>
Now, this objection lies equally againſt Dr. Johnſon's reading as againſt Dr. Warburton's, and muſt be removed before I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw my <hi>caveat</hi> againſt any innovation being made in the text. Indeed I will oppoſe, <hi>totis viribus,</hi> the admiſſion of Dr. Johnſon's <hi>ſeal,</hi> leſt ſome future commentator ſhould ſtart up, and affirm that, although to <hi>elect by</hi> or <hi>with a commiſſion</hi> may be nonſenſe; yet to ERECT <hi>by</hi> or <hi>with</hi> a commiſſion is ſenſe; <hi>to erect</hi> here meaning nothing more than to <hi>ſet up,</hi> to <hi>promote,</hi> which is done by <hi>commiſſion.</hi> And how plauſibly might not ſuch an annotator maintain, that ſuch reading would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conſiſtent with the context?</p>

                  <p>This paſſage ſeems to have confounded all the commentators. Dr. Warburton makes the following curious and learned note upon it.
<q>This is ſo obſcure a paſſage, but ſo fine in its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, that it deſerves to be explained. A feodary was one that, in the times of vaſſalage, held lands of the chief lord, under the tenure of paying rent and ſervice, which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures were called <hi>feuda</hi> amongſt the Goths. Now, ſays An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo, <hi>we are all frail</hi>; yes, replies Iſabella, <hi>if all mankind were not feodaries, who owe what they are to this tenure of imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, and who ſucceed each other by the ſame tenure, as well as my brother, I would give him up.</hi> The comparing mankind, lying under the weight of original ſin, to a feodary, who owes ſuit and ſervice to his lord, is, I think, not ill-ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</q>
—This note, with little variation, is inſerted in Theobald's edition; who ſays it explains one of the moſt beautiful alluſions imaginable.—The preſent editor inſerts this note alſo, without any remark of his own. He obſerves indeed, that to <hi>owe</hi> means in this place to <hi>own,</hi> to <hi>hold,</hi> to have poſſeſſion.—For my part, I never could reconcile the words of this paſſage, by any mode of conſtruction, to the ſenſe here put on it. Indeed, it never appeared to me, from
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0047702200:40"/>
the tenour of the converſation, that Iſabel could poſſibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſuch a conſtrained and far-fetched alluſion, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Dr. Warburton hath here fiſhed out for her. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her meaning to be much more ſimple, and if the reader obſerves the connection of this ſpeech with thoſe of Angelo that precede and follow, I doubt not but he will be of my opinion. It is true, that to <hi>owe</hi> means here, as in other parts <note n="*" place="bottom">Particularly in the Tempeſt; where Proſpero ſays to Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,

Taking the words in this, their true ſenſe, let us ſee if we cannot, without forcing their conſtruction, diſcover a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more in character with the ſpeaker, and therefore more likely to be intended by Shakeſpeare:

That is,
<q>Let my brother die, if not one of his companions, if only he, of all his ſex, is frail, and hath ſucceeded in his attempts on women, by taking advantage of a like frailty in them.</q>
—That this is the true ſenſe, I think, is put paſt diſpute by the ſubſequent ſpeech of Angelo; who takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, from the laſt ſuggeſtion of Iſabel, to ſay
<q>Nay, <hi>women</hi> are frail <hi>TOO.</hi>

                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0047702200:41"/>
Which is as much as if he had ſaid,
<q>Nay, the women, as you obſerve, are frail too.</q>
—Ay, ſays Iſabel,
<q>
                        <l>—As the glaſſes where they view themſelves.</l>

But I cannot ſee how we can, with any propriety, be ſaid to <hi>profit</hi> by what mars our creation. I rather think Iſabel means to ſay, that man diſgraces himſelf by profiting or taking advantage of female weakneſs. And this ſeems to agree with the context.</p>

                  <p>Dr. Warburton, in order, I preſume, to lay hold of an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for altering the text, excepts againſt this paſſage, as being a direct perſuaſive to <hi>ſuicide.</hi> The abſurdity, however, of ſuppoſing that the ſpeaker intended it as ſuch, is obvious, ſince he is endeavouring to inſtil into a condemned priſoner a reſignation to his ſentence. Dr. Johnſon obſerves, that the meaning ſeems plainly this, that
<q>none but fools would wiſh to keep li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e; or, none but fools would keep it, if choice were allowed.</q>
A ſenſe which, whether true or not, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, is certainly innocent. But though our editor is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to exculpate Shakeſpeare in this particular, it appears to be only that he may fall upon him with the greater violence in a page or two after; where Dr. Warburton vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes to pay the poet a compliment. This paſſage is in the ſame ſpeech as the foregoing;
<q>
                        <l>—Thy beſt of reſt is ſleep,</l>
                        <l>And that thou oft provok'ſt; yet groſly fear'ſt</l>
                        <l>Thy death, which is no more.</l>
                     </q>
This paſſage, ſays Dr. Warburton,
<q>is evidently taken from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0047702200:42"/>
the following, of Cicero: <hi>Habes ſomnum imaginem mortis, eamque quotidie induis, &amp; dubitas quin ſenſus in morte nullus ſit, cum in ejus ſimulachro videas eſſe nullum ſenſum.</hi> But the Epicurean inſinuation is with great judgment omitted in the imitation.</q>
On this note Dr. Johnſon hath made the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing remark:
<q>Here Dr. Warburton might have found a ſentiment worthy of his animadverſion. I cannot, without indignation, find Shakeſpeare ſaying, that <hi>death is only ſleep,</hi> lengthening out his exhortation by a ſentence which in the friar is impious, in the reaſoner is fooliſh, and in the poet is trite and vulgar.</q>
—Nor can I, Dr. Johnſon, without equal indignation, find you miſrepreſenting Shakeſpeare, and thence taking occaſion to condemn him for what he is not culpable; lengthening out your cenſure with imputations that, being falſe in themſelves, appear as invidious in the <hi>man,</hi> as they are contemptible in the <hi>critic.</hi> Would not one imagine, from the warmth with which Dr. Johnſon ſpeaks of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, that it militates againſt the doctrine of the immortality of the ſoul; inſinuating that in death we cloſe our eyes, and ſleep for ever?—Nothing, however, can be more foreign from the plain intent of the ſpeaker, and the obvious meaning of the paſſage. The duke, in the aſſumed character of a friar, is endeavouring to perſuade Claudio to acquieſce in the ſentence of death paſſed on him, and to prepare himſelf for launching into eternity. To this end he adviſes him to think altogether on death; and to excite him to do ſo, he enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the ſeveral foibles of humanity, and the calamities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to human life; evidently intending by this means to wean his affections from the world, and render him leſs averſe to part with it, and leſs apprehenſive of the pain of dying. <hi>Thou oft provokeſt ſleep,</hi> ſays he, yet abſurdly fear to die; which, with regard to the painful and perplexing vigil of life, is only to go to ſleep. For that he only ſpeaks of the mere <hi>ſenſe of death,</hi> the parting of the ſoul from the body, and that Claudio underſtood him ſo, is very evident, by the reply which the latter makes to his harangue; notwithſtanding the very
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0047702200:43"/>
laſt words of it ſeem to be full as exceptionable as thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to.

                     </q>
If any thing further be neceſſary to corroborate what is here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, we might inſtance the duke's exhorting him, in ſcene III. of the ſame act, <hi>to go to his knees</hi> and prepare for death. It is highly inconſiſtent to think ſuch a piece of advice ſhould come from one who conceived death to be a perpetual ſleep. Prayers muſt ſeem as ſuperfluous to him, as the advice muſt appear impertinent to the priſoner. But that Claudio had the ſtrongeſt notions of a future ſtate after death is not to be doubted, ſince, ſpeaking of the ſin of debauching his ſiſter, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo's deſign to commit it, he ſays
<q>
                        <l>If it were damnable, he being ſo wiſe,</l>
                        <l>Why would he for the <hi>momentary</hi> trick</l>
                        <l>Be <hi>perdurably</hi> fin'd?</l>
                     </q>
Again, when his fears recurring, he tells his ſiſter that
<q>Death is a fearful thing,</q>
it is plain, he doth not confine the meaning of the word, as the Duke did, to the mere act or circumſtance of dying. For when ſhe retorts upon him,
<q>And ſhamed life a hateful,</q>
he goes on,
<q>Ay, but to die, and go we know not where.</q>
As if he had ſaid, I do not mean the mere pain of dying; it is what is to come after death that I fear, when we are to
<q>
                        <l>—go we know not where;</l>
                        <l>To lie in cold obſtruction, and to rot;</l>

Can we think that Shakeſpeare could ſo far forget himſelf, as to be here ſo very explicit regarding the notion of a future ſtate, if but two or three pages before he had been inculcating a contrary doctrine!—What then muſt we think of his commentator, who affects to be moved with indignation, and in effect preſumes to charge him on this account with vulgarity, folly and impiety!

                        <p>I had written the above remarks and ſent them to the preſs, without recollecting that a ſimilar reference to this imprecation of Shakeſpeare is to be met with in the appendix to the Canons of Criticiſm, (laſt edition, page 260.)
<q>I leave the public to judge, ſays that ſenſible critic, which has been engaged <hi>againſt</hi> Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare, Mr. Warburton or I, who have in part at leaſt vindicated that beſt of poets from the worſt of critics; from one, who has been guilty of a greater violation of him, than that of the authors on which he imprecated vengeance in his epitaph. A violation which, were he not armed againſt the ſuperſtition of believing in portents and prodigies, might make him dread the apparition of that injured bard.</q>
—Here we ſee the murder comes out: Dr. Warburton, it is true, was not only armed againſt the ſuperſtition
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0047702200:45"/>of believing in ghoſts, by his principles as a <hi>philoſopher,</hi> but alſo againſt their doing him hurt, by the awful power annexed to his ſacred functions and character as a <hi>prieſt.</hi> But this is not the caſe with Dr. Johnſon, whoſe religion and philoſophy put together, it ſeems, cannot ſecure him againſt the terrors of ſuch ſuperſtition: ſo that, as I before obſerved, here the ſecret comes out; and we ſee the reaſon for his ſitting up all night, and lying a-bed all day, for fear of apparitions—It is not ſo much from his fear of ghoſts in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, (for we know he did not appear to be afraid of Fanny) but of the ghoſt of Shakeſpeare, whoſe fame he is conſcious of having inhumanly aſſaſſinated, and whoſe violated muſe cries aloud for vengeance againſt him.</p>

<q>

In the firſt place we ſee, that <hi>guards</hi> here ſignify <hi>lace,</hi> as referring to <hi>livery,</hi> and as having no ſenſe in the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>ſatellites.</hi> Now <hi>prieſtly guards</hi> means <hi>ſanctity,</hi> which is the ſenſe required. But <hi>princely guards</hi> means nothing but <hi>rich lace,</hi> which is a ſenſe the paſſage will not bear. <hi>Angelo,</hi> indeed, as <hi>deputy,</hi> might be called the <hi>princely An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo</hi>; but not in this place, where the immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding words of, This <hi>outward-ſainted</hi> deputy, demand the reading I have reſtored.</p>
                     </q>
To this very curious argument of Dr. Warburton's, the preſent editor only adds the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The firſt folio has, in both places, <hi>prenzie,</hi> from which the other folios made <hi>princely,</hi> and every editor may make what he can.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is really very kind of Dr. Johnſon to give <hi>others</hi> leave to make SOMETHING of what he can make NOTHING <hi>himſelf.</hi>—Let us ſee, therefore, what others <hi>have made</hi> of it.—The author of the Canons of Criticiſm objects to Dr. Warbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's emendation; obſerving that,
<q>if <hi>princely guards</hi> means nothing but <hi>rich lace,</hi> he ſhould be glad to know how <hi>prieſtly guards</hi> ſhould come to ſignify any thing more than <hi>black lace?</hi>
                     </q>
—The author of the Reviſal of Shakeſpeare's Text, goes ſtill farther, and ſays,
<q>We ſhould undoubtedly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0047702200:47"/>
reſtore the ancient reading in both places, the <hi>princely</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo, and in <hi>princely</hi> guards. Nothing [ſays he] can be weaker and more deſtitute of all foundation, than Mr. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burton's criticiſm. Angelo is repreſented as ſupporting the ſtate of a prince, and the authority of government, by exceſſive ſeverity; but there is not the leaſt hint [given] in the whole play of his affecting a ſanctified exterior, or ſetting up for a devotee.</q>
                     <hi>Prieſtly guards,</hi> we are told,
<q>means ſanctity;</q>
but how the body could be inveſted or covered
<q>with ſanctity, Mr. Warburton hath not thought proper to explain; for I preſume he doth not imagine that he wore the prieſtly habit, to which he could be no way en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, as appears by his marriage afterwards, as well as from many other circumſtances needleſs to enumerate.</q>
                     <q>In princely guards,</q>
moſt certainly ſignifies in a habit adorned "as becomes a prince."</p>
                  <p>If it be thought neceſſary to add any thing to theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks; it may be obſerved, that the word <hi>guards</hi> is not ſtrictly confined to mean <hi>lace,</hi> as Dr. Warburton inſinuates; but is uſed for ornaments of dreſs, or finery in general. Thus Shakeſpeare, in ſome other of his plays, I think it is in Love's Labour Loſt, ſpeaks of the <hi>guards of Cupid's hoſe</hi>; in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability meaning the clocks of his ſtockings <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>I am well aware that our anceſtors, wearing long hoſe, ſometimes included their breeches too under that denomination; but I cannot ſuppoſe this part of the dreſs would be particularly ſpecified, if <hi>lace</hi> merely was intended, unleſs Cupid might be ſuppoſed to have worn laced breeches without having a laced coat.</p>
                     </note>; which could not with propriety be called <hi>lace.</hi> Dr. Warburton, indeed, thinks the word <hi>livery,</hi> in this ſentence, fixes that of <hi>guards</hi> to mere <hi>lace,</hi> becauſe, it is true, moſt liveries are laced. It does not, however, follow that <hi>lace</hi> is eſſential to a <hi>livery,</hi> or that a livery might not be given to ſervants without any lace in the trimming of it: for the word <hi>livery</hi> comes either from the French <hi>livrée,</hi> of <hi>livrer,</hi> to deliver or give; or from the Italian <hi>livrea,</hi> or the Spaniſh <hi>librea,</hi> all having the ſame
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0047702200:48"/>
meaning; ſo that a ſuit of cloaths, with trimmings of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent colour, given to a ſervant, is as much a <hi>livery,</hi> as if it were covered with <hi>lace.</hi> Again, to come nearer the point, can we ſuppoſe that when Baſſanio, in the Merchant of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, commands his followers to give Launcelot
<q>
                        <l>—a livery</l>
                        <l>More <hi>guarded</hi> than his fellows:</l>
                     </q>
he means particularly that it ſhould have more <hi>lace</hi> on it? No, ſurely, he only means that it ſhould, on the whole, be more fine and gaudy.</p>
                  <p>The meaning of the words thus ſettled, it is with great propriety Iſabel calls the princely badges and ducal finery of Angelo the <hi>cunning</hi> LIVERY <hi>of hell</hi>; as being <hi>given</hi> him in order that he might the more effectually ſerve its abhorred and damnable purpoſes.</p>

Why will you not indulge the fictitious friar in the harmleſs jeſt he intends to make of the ignorance of the poor conſtable? You will ſay, perhaps, you ſaw no jeſt intended. I believe you; but certainly, ſuch a one as it was, there was one intended; and this it is. The word <hi>friar</hi> being a corruption of the French word <hi>frere,</hi> meaning brother; the conſtable had, in fact, called the ſuppoſed friar <hi>good father brother</hi>; to which the other jocoſely replies, by calling him in turn <hi>good brother father.</hi>—The reader will now, therefore, expunge this word, or let it ſtand, as he thinks proper.</p>

                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0047702200:49"/>Dr. Warburton ſays, the meaning of this paſſage is,
<q>Are there no women come out cured from a ſalivation?</q>
And this explanation is implicitly adopted by Dr. Johnſon. The author of the Reviſal, however, ſuppoſes the meaning of this very affected cant to be,
<q>Are there no freſh women, no maidenheads to be had now? For (continues the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſer, very gravely) Pigmalion's ſtatue newly made woman, was certainly a pure virgin.</q>
—Now, not to controvert the virginity of a marble ſtatue, or to query how long it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſo, when converted into fleſh and blood, in the hands of
<q>
                        <l>Pig (what do ye call him) malion</l>

                     </q>
I conceive theſe ſcholiaſts to be all miſtaken with regard to the ſenſe of the paſſage. It is perfectly agreeable to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Lucio, to call an innocent <hi>uncome-at-able</hi> virgin a Pigmalion's ſtatue; nor could he with any propriety give that name to a proſtitute, either under a ſalivation, or newly come out of it. What he meant, therefore, by Pigmalion's images newly made women, was young girls newly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched. The deflowering a maid is frequently called, by dramatic writers, the <hi>making a woman</hi> of her. Again, I think it pretty evident that Lucio is too well acquainted with rogues and bawds, too deep in "the trick of it," not to know that maidenheads were commodities they ſeldom dealt in. On the other hand, I think it as plain that Lucio did not aſk after ſuch battered brims as might be juſt come out of the powdering tub: for when the clown tells him his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs is herſelf in that ſituation, he ſays, <hi>'Tis good; it is the right of it; it muſt be ſo. Ever your</hi> FRESH <hi>whore, and your powder'd bawd: an unſhunn'd conſequence: it muſt be ſo.</hi>—I fancy Lucio would be apt to think ſuch pickled devils as came out of the powdering tub, <hi>ſound</hi> as they poſſibly might be, too <hi>ſtale</hi> to be called <hi>freſh</hi> meat.</p>
                  <q>

                  <p>
                     <q>This ſtrange nonſenſe (ſays Dr. Warburton) ſhould be thus corrected, IT's <hi>not</hi> DOWN <hi>i'th' laſt</hi> REIGN. <hi>i. e.</hi> theſe are ſeverities unknown to the old duke's time. And this is to the purpoſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Very much to the purpoſe truly! and ſo the ingenious au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Canons of Criticiſm hath ſhewn <note n="*" place="bottom">See Canons of Criticiſm, page 25.</note>; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, our editor, without taking the leaſt notice of what Mr. Edwards has advanced, proceeds thus.
<q>Dr. Warbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's emendation is ingenious; but I know not whether the ſenſe may not be reſtored with leſs change. Let us conſider it. Lucio, a prating fop, meets his old friend going to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and pours out upon him his impertinent interrogatories: to which, when the poor fellow makes no anſwer, he adds, <hi>What reply? Ha! what ſay'ſt thou to this? tune, matter and method—is't not! drown'd i'th' laſt rain? ha? what ſay'ſt thou, trot?</hi> &amp;c. It is a common phraſe uſed in low raillery of a man creſt-fallen and dejected, that <hi>he looks like a drown'd puppy.</hi> Lucio, therefore aſks him whether he was drowned in the laſt rain, and therefore cannot ſpeak?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dr. Johnſon's explanation of this paſſage is, in my opinion, leſs clear and much leſs conſiſtent with his own pointing than that given by Mr. Edwards. Indeed the latter ſuppoſes Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey's anſwer only to be drowned in the laſt rain [a prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial phraſe, he ſays, to expreſs a thing which is loſt, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not to be found]; whereas Dr. Johnſon ſuppoſes that Pompey himſelf is taxed with having been drowned in the laſt rain. Taking their own authority, however, for the uſe of their proverbs, Mr. Edwards's explanation is not half ſo far-fetched as Dr. Johnſon's. It is, indeed, a ſtrange round-about kind of ſalutation, to aſk a man whether or not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0047702200:51"/>
he was drowned in the laſt rain; becauſe, truly, he looks dejected, and therefore may be phraſeologically compared to a drown'd puppy?</p>
                  <p>Dr. Gray would make a farther emendation of the text, in this paſſage, of which our editor hath made mention in his appendix; but ſeems to diſapprove it. The Doctor propoſes that, inſtead of reading <hi>what ſay'ſt thou, trot?</hi> we ſhould read, <hi>what ſay'ſt thou to't?</hi> the word <hi>trot</hi> being ſeldom, if ever, uſed to a man.—To this Dr. Johnſon replies,
<q>
                        <hi>Trot,</hi> or as it is now often pronounced <hi>honeſt trout,</hi> is a familiar addreſs to a man among the provincial vulgar.</q>
Now, it appears to me, although I think Dr. Gray's emendation very admiſſible, that Lucio might very probably here mean to give Pompey an appellation uſually given to women, by way of gibing him for following ſo ſcandalous an employment as that of a bawd, uſually practiſed by wretches of that ſex. But be this as it may, I think nobody can heſitate about Dr. Johnſon's being in the wrong, when he ſuppoſes that Lucio might call Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey Bum, the cock-bawd, HONEST <hi>trout.—Trout!</hi> indeed! Dr. Johnſon ſurely muſt imagine his readers to be very <hi>gud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,</hi> to bait his hook with ſuch grubs, as theſe grub-ſtreet annotations!</p>
                  <p>Vol. I. pages 329 and 330. are inſerted two notes from Dr. Warburton, without any remark of the editor's; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they are both ſufficiently refuted and exploded in the Canons of Criticiſm, pages 25 and 26. I muſt beg leave, however, for that reaſon to paſs them over here.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0047702200:52"/>
he does not chuſe to hazard them for his own; as he does when they agree with thoſe of Edwards, and ſome others. But, for fear they ſhould be wrong, he takes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <hi>verbum ſacerdotis,</hi> and ſkulks behind the name of WARBURTON. This he does with regard to the paſſage now before us; and yet if I ſhould admit a ſingle emendation of all thoſe Dr. Warburton propoſes, I believe it would be this; and yet I don't approve of it. But the caſe is, I as little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of what is advanced by others in favour of the preſent reading, and yet, as Dr. Johnſon ſays, nothing better ſuggeſts itſelf. Dr. Warburton ſays,
<q>We ſhould read SWERVE, i. e. deviate from her nature. The common reading gives us the idea of a ranting whore.</q>
In oppoſition to this, the author of the Reviſal ſays, the common reading is
<q>agreeable to a very common form of expreſſion, <hi>This would make a ſaint ſwear,</hi> and ſuppoſes it means no more than that the exceſs of the provocation would get the better of the mild diſpoſition even of Mercy herſelf, and put her in a paſſion.</q>
In anſwer again to this, however, it may be obſerved, that we have no ſuch <hi>very common</hi> form of ſpeech as is here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted. Nay, I don't know that we can poſſibly have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for ſuch a form. Make a <hi>ſaint</hi> ſwear! Pray where are there any ſaints now-a-days to be met with? For my part, I never converſed with any but fictitious ones. I have heard, indeed, of things being provoking enough <hi>to make a</hi> PARSON <hi>ſwear,</hi> and that even in the middle of his ſermon. But alas! alas! there is a great difference between <hi>ſaints</hi> and <hi>parſons</hi>; though I hope the author of the Reviſal is too honeſt a man wilfully to impoſe a parſon on his readers for a ſaint.—The true ſtate of the caſe appears to me to be as follows: the poet did not intend, or at leaſt did not effect, a compleat perſonification of Mercy. If he had, he would not have given us the idea of a ranting whore, as Dr. Warburton juſtly expreſſes it; nor would he have repreſented Mercy as ſtripped of her attributes, or put in a paſſion, as the Reviſer
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0047702200:53"/>
has it.—It ſeems to me that Eſcalus ſpeaks of that mercy, or merciful diſpoſition, exiſting in his own breaſt, agreeable, and in reply, to what the bawd had ſaid to him in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding ſpeech. <hi>Your honour is accounted a</hi> MERCIFUL <hi>man.</hi> To which he anſwers,
<q>Yes, but ſuch provocation would make me, merciful as I am, ſwear and play the tyrant.</q>
To this it may be objected, that Eſcalus repreſents himſelf in this caſe as a ranting bully, juſt as Mercy, in the other, gives the idea of a ranting whore. So that, perhaps, after all, we had better abide by the literal conſtruction of the text, and ſuppoſe the proſopopeia compleat; in which caſe to <hi>ſwear</hi> muſt mean to make a vow never to be moved by pleas or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion; to be <hi>unrelenting,</hi> being one of the principal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtics of a tyrant.</p>

                  <p>I wiſh Dr. Johnſon, every time he had dictated any of the articles of his critical creed, had given us a reaſon for the faith that is in him. Why he ſhould believe Barnardine to be deſperately <hi>miſchievous,</hi> I cannot poſſibly conceive. The Provoſt ſeems to give him a very different character: <hi>He hath evermore,</hi> ſays he, <hi>had the liberty of the priſon: give him leave to eſcape hence, he would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days entirely drunk. We have very often awaked him, as if to carry him to execution, and ſhewed him a ſeeming warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.</hi> Is this the deſcription of a man <hi>deſperately miſchievous?</hi> I ſhould rather think that, by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0047702200:54"/>
                     <hi>deſperately mortal,</hi> means totally incurable of diſeaſes, acquired by his beaſtly courſe of life; or elſe that, deſpairing or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of life, he looks upon himſelf as dead to the world, and takes no thought of what becomes of him.

                  <p>Dr. Johnſon hath here inſerted the word <hi>convented,</hi> inſtead of <hi>convened,</hi> which was the common reading. <hi>Convented,</hi> indeed, was the reading of the firſt folio, which Dr. Warburton in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts upon to be right <note n="*" place="bottom">And yet Dr. Warburton, as the author of the Reviſal ſhrewdly remarks, calls that edition, on another occaſion,
<q>the old blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering folio.</q>
                     </note>, giving his reaſons for it in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing arrogant and fooliſh note, which is as impertinently and fillily adopted by our editor.
<q>The firſt folio reads <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,</hi> and this is right; for to <hi>convene</hi> ſignifies to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but <hi>convent,</hi> to cite or ſummons. Yet, becauſe <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented</hi> hurts the meaſure, the Oxford editor ſticks to <hi>convened,</hi> though it be <hi>nonſenſe,</hi> and ſignifies, <hi>whenever he is aſſembled together.</hi> But thus it will be, when the author is thinking of one thing, and his critic of another. The poet was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to his ſenſe, and the editor, quite throughout his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0047702200:55"/>
performance, to nothing but the meaſure; which Shakeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare having entirely neglected, like all the dramatic writers of that age, he has ſpruced him up with all the exactneſs of a modern meaſurer of ſyllables.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhould be glad to know how either Dr. Warburton or Dr. Johnſon came to know that Shakeſpeare <hi>entirely neglected meaſure?</hi> Shakeſpeare had a poetical ear; and though he might not ſtand to count his fingers, as probably theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do when they write verſes, he wrote in general much more melodiouſly than any of the dramatic writers of his own age, or perhaps of the preſent. The Oxford editor did very wiſely, therefore, in abiding by the meaſure, as he could do it without any injury to the ſenſe. For to <hi>convene,</hi> as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Reviſal juſtly obſerves, means not only to <hi>aſſemble together,</hi> but to <hi>cite</hi> or <hi>cauſe to appear</hi>; and is rendered in Latin by <hi>cito, cieo.</hi>—To this I may add alſo, that <hi>cito</hi> does not mean ſimply to <hi>cite</hi> or <hi>ſummons</hi> in general, but alſo to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons or produce as a witneſs, exactly agreeable to the caſe before us. Thus CICERO, <hi>in hâc re te teſtem citabo.</hi> But perhaps theſe learned gentlemen will object to all this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the verb <hi>convene</hi> is not derived from <hi>cito, cico,</hi> but from <hi>convenio</hi>: they will profit little, however, by this evaſion; for the verb <hi>convenio</hi> itſelf is uſed in the ſenſe of giving a cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſummons. Thus PLAUTUS, <hi>illum in jus conveniam.</hi> But ſuppoſing theſe quotations to be, as learned quotations generally are, nothing at all to the purpoſe, I may ſafely bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a phraſe from Scripture on this occaſion, and ſay to Dr. Johnſon, <hi>Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee, thou</hi> CARE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LESS COMMENTATOR! The author of the Reviſal ſeems a little unhappy that, having kept no common-place-book, he cannot produce an example of the uſe of the word <hi>convene</hi> in the ſenſe contended for: but, if he had turned to Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's common-place-book, i. e. his folio dictionary, he would have there found that this ſenſe is properly authorized. To <hi>convene,</hi> ſays the lexicographer, is <hi>to ſummon judicially</hi>; as a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0047702200:56"/>
proof of which he quotes the following paſſage from AY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIFFE; <hi>By the papal canon law, clerks, in criminal and civil cauſes, cannot be</hi> CONVENED <hi>before any but an eccleſiaſtical judge.</hi>—What a pity it is there ſhould be ſo little connection between Samuel Johnſon, M. A. the lexicographer, and Dr. Johnſon the commentator? But ſo it is; nor is it any thing new; people are apt to forget themſelves as they riſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</p>

and miſuſing them. To remedy which, I ſuppoſe, there was placed up againſt the wall a table of forfeitures, adapted to every offence of this kind; which, it is not likely, would long preſerve its authority.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such is Dr. Warburton's explanation of this paſſage; which, our editor ſays, may ſerve till a better is diſcovered. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, nevertheleſs, that
<q>whoever has ſeen the inſtruments of a chirurgeon, knows that they may be very eaſily kept out of improper hands in a very ſmall box, or in his pocket.</q>
—The truth is, that the tables of forfeits, hung up in barbers ſhops, are ſtill extant in ſome parts of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; at leaſt I remember to have ſeen one about twelve or thirteen years ago, in an excurſion from Burlington to North-Allerton in Yorkſhire. I think it was either at Malton or at Thirſk, and very probably it is there ſtill. I do not, indeed, recollect the name of the operator, in whoſe ſhop it was affixed; but its contents ſtruck me ſo much on reading, that I believe I can recite them from memory pretty exactly. They do not relate, however, to the handling of chirurgical inſtruments, but to civility and good behaviour; and ſeem not injudiciouſly calculated for a place, where perſons of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtations and degrees were accuſtomed to meet, in order to be ſucceſſively ſhaved.

                        <p>Do you ſo, Sir? and was the duke a fleſh-monger, a fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?</p>
                     </sp>
                  </q>
                  <p>Dr. Johnſon, who ſeems conſtantly on the watch to catch Shakeſpeare tripping, obſerves here, that
<q>Lucio had not, in the former converſation, mentioned <hi>cowardice</hi> among the faults of the duke.</q>
But, ſays he, very graciouſly,
<q>ſuch failures of memory are incident to writers more diligent than this poet.</q>
—On this occaſion, I cannot help remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it is ſomewhat ſingular to find our editor ſo extremely remiſs and negligent in illuſtrating the beauties of Shakeſpeare, and ſo very diligent in diſcovering his faults. This carping critic is in this particular, however, egregiouſly miſtaken; there being no grounds for charging the poet, in this place, with want of attention to his plot. It is true, that Lucio does not expreſly call the duke a coward, in that part of their converſation which paſſed on the ſtage, in ſcene VI. act 3. Our editor might have obſerved, however, that he hath a farther converſation with him in ſcene XI. act 4. where he begins again to talk of the <hi>old fantaſtical duke of dark corners</hi>; and when the duke wants to ſhake him off, by bidding him farewel, and telling him his <hi>company is fairer than honeſt,</hi> Lucio will not be thus got rid of, but follows him, ſaying, <hi>By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end. If bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of bur, I ſhall ſtick.</hi> Is it not very natural to ſuppoſe, that Lucio might afterwards call the duke a <hi>coward,</hi> conſidering the many opprobrious names he had already given him? and is the poet to be cenſured, becauſe he hath made the Duke charge Lucio with a ſingle word of detraction, which was not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſpoken before the audience? If this be not hypercriticiſm, I know not what is. But, to make the matter worſe on the part of our unfortunate editor, the Duke doth not charge
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0047702200:60"/>
Lucio with calling him a coward, at the time when he runs on enumerating his other vices. For this was in the open ſtreet, through which the officers paſſed in carrying the bawds to priſon: but the time is particularly ſpecified when he called him <hi>coward,</hi> which was when the duke met him in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and, as I above remarked, could not get rid of him. This is plain from the context.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Dr. Johnſon hath, in my opinion, a very exceptionable note on this paſſage. I ſhall quote it therefore entire, and make my obſervations on it afterwards.
<q>The duke has juſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that Iſabel is <hi>importuned, againſt all ſenſe,</hi> to ſolicit for Angelo; yet here, <hi>againſt all ſenſe,</hi> ſhe ſolicits for him. Her argument is extraordinary.
<q>
                           <l>A due ſincerity govern'd his deeds,</l>
                           <l>'Till he did look on me; ſince it is ſo,</l>
                           <l>Let him not die.</l>
                        </q>
That Angelo had committed all the crimes charged againſt him, as far as he could commit them, is evident. The only <hi>intent</hi> which <hi>his act did not overtake,</hi> was the defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Iſabel. Of this Angelo was only intentionally guilty.—Angelo's crimes were ſuch, as muſt ſufficiently juſtify puniſhment, whether its end be to ſecure the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent from wrong, or to deter guilt by example; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every reader feels ſome indignation when he finds him ſpared. From what extenuation of his crime can Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, who yet ſuppoſes her brother dead, form any plea in his favour? <hi>Since he was good till he look'd on me, let him not die.</hi> I am afraid our varlet poet intended to inculcate, that women think ill of nothing that raiſes the credit of their beauty, and are ready, however virtuous, to pardon any act which they think incited by their own charms.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To expoſe the ſeveral fallacies ſuggeſted throughout the above note, I ſhall obſerve firſt, that it was very natural for Mariana to ſolicit Iſabel's interceſſion for her huſband, the man ſhe ſo much loved. I cannot think alſo, that it is, in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0047702200:62"/>
any reſpect, out of character for Iſabel, after repeated ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to be moved to oblige Mariana, who had already obliged her, ſo far at leaſt as to prevent the apparent neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of proſtituting herſelf to Angelo: eſpecially if we reflect on the tranquil ſtate of mind ſhe ſeems to be in with regard to her brother; in whoſe ſuppoſed death ſhe appears to have acquieſced, either from principles of religion or philoſophy: for when the Duke, in the foregoing page, ſpeaking of her brother, ſays,
<q>
                        <l>—Peace be with him!</l>
                        <l>That life is better life, paſt fearing death,</l>
                        <l>Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort.</l>
                        <l>So, happy is your brother.</l>
                     </q>
Iſabel anſwers,
<q>I do, my lord.</q>
From a principle of philoſophy, ſhe muſt be very conſcious that the death of Angelo could not bring her brother to life again; and if to this reflection we ſuppoſe her religion might add the ſuggeſtion of Chriſtian charity and forgiveneſs, I do not ſee any impropriety in Iſabel's ſoliciting Angelo's pardon.</p>
                  <p>As to the argument ſhe makes uſe of, and which Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thinks ſo very extraordinary, it is to be obſerved, that ſhe does not make uſe of it as a poſitive plea, but introduces it with
<q>
                        <l>—I PARTLY THINK</l>
                        <l>A due ſincerity, &amp;c.</l>
                     </q>
Again, Dr. Johnſon ſays,
<q>the only <hi>intent</hi> which <hi>his act did not overtake,</hi> was the defilement of Iſabel.</q>
Surely, Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon forgets the intended execution of Claudio! There is no doubt that Angelo's guilty intentions fully deſerved puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but as the principal of them failed of being carried into execution, I do not ſee why the reader ſhould feel ſo much indignation at his being pardoned, eſpecially as he muſt perceive the propriety of doing poetical juſtice to the injured Mariana; which would not be the caſe, if her new-made
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0047702200:63"/>
huſband were to be immediately puniſhed with the ſeverity due to his wicked deſigns.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſiniſter meaning he imputes to the poet, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a covert ſatire on the fair ſex, I think enough is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid to exculpate him; I wiſh, therefore, Dr. Johnſon were equally excuſable for giving Shakeſpeare the appellation of <hi>varlet</hi> poet. Our editor can hardly intend here to confine that term to its ſimple and ancient meaning: for where is the jeſt or propriety of calling Shakeſpeare a yeoman, or ſervant, agreeably to the old meaning of the word <hi>varlet</hi>; which like <hi>fur,</hi> in Latin, it is allowed, originally conveyed no baſe or opprobrious idea?—And yet, if Dr. Johnſon did not uſe the word in this limited and antiquated ſenſe, what can he mean by calling Shakeſpeare a mean, ſorry, or raſcally poet? For this is the modern ſenſe of the word; and in this ſenſe the word <hi>varletry</hi> is inſerted in a certain folio dictionary, on the authority of Shakeſpeare himſelf.—Perhaps, indeed, Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only meant here to expreſs himſelf in a ſtrain of wit and pleaſantry. If ſo, let him beware how he attempts to be witty again: for ſurely never was ſuch an aukward attempt made before! It is not in his nature.</p>

I ſhall only quote thoſe of the two latter.</p>

                     <q>
                        <hi>Which doth offer to ſwear upon a book.</hi>] This nonſenſe ſeems to have taken its riſe from the accident of a loſt line in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the play for the preſs; ſo that the paſſage, for the future, ſhould be printed thus: <hi>Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer table, which doth * * * * * offer to ſwear upon a book I ſhall have good fortune.</hi> It is impoſſible to find, again, the loſt line; but the loſt ſenſe is eaſy enough—<hi>if any man in Italy have a fairer table which doth</hi> [promiſe good luck, I am miſtaken. I durſt almoſt] <hi>offer to ſwear upon a book, I ſhall have good fortune.</hi>
                     </q>
Dr. Johnſon, after condemning Theobald's note in the ſevereſt terms, and informing us that by <hi>table</hi> is meant the palm expanded, goes on very magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially thus.—
<q>Dr. Warburton underſtood the word<note n="†" place="bottom">A mighty matter to underſtand truly! which is familiar to every ſtrolling gypſy, and as well known to every kitchen-wench who can make ſhift to ſpell the Egyptian Fortune teller, Palmiſtry laid open, or the two-penny Chiromancer.</note>, but
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0047702200:65"/>
puzzles himſelf, with no great ſucceſs, in purſuit of the meaning.</q>
—No wonder at that Dr. Johnſon! people ſeldom <hi>puzzle</hi> themſelves with any <hi>great ſucceſs</hi> in purſuit of any thing.—But to proceed with our editor's note.
<q>The whole matter is this: Launcelot congratulates himſelf upon his dexterity and good fortune; and, in the height of his rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, inſpects his hand, and congratulates himſelf upon the felicities in his table. The act of expounding his hand, puts him in mind of the action in which the palm is ſhewn, by raiſing it to lay it on the book, in judicial atteſtations. <hi>Well,</hi> ſays he, if any man in Italy have a fairer table, that doth offer to ſwear upon a book—here he ſtops with an abruptneſs very common, and proceeds to particulars.</q>
—No, Sir, he doth not ſtop here; but goes on, agreeable to Dr. Warburton's explanation, to ſay what is to be ſworn upon the book, i. e. that he ſhall have good fortune. But this is not to be ſworn either by Launcelot himſelf, or by any other Italian. It is the hand itſelf that promiſes ſo ſtrongly, and, as it were, offers to ſwear upon a book, that he ſhall have good fortune. And in this ſenſe the author of the Reviſal takes it; though I think he has not hit off the meaning quite happily. His interpretation is,
<q>If any man in Italy have a fairer table, which pronounces that I ſhall have good fortune, with as much aſſurance as if it was ready to ſwear it upon a book.—Here, ſays he, the ſentence breaks off, and we muſt ſupply, <hi>I am miſtaken,</hi> or ſome other expreſſion of like import.</q>
—None of theſe commentators, though very ſenſible of the break in this paſſage, ſeem to know where it lies; but if I might be allowed to take the moſt trifling liberty in the world with the text, I dare ſay the reader would ſee the whole meaning and propriety of it, at one view.—<hi>Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble!—Why, it doth offer to ſwear upon a book, I ſhall have good fortune.—Go to, &amp;c.</hi> Taking the words, alſo, in this ſenſe, there is a beauty and propriety in ſaying the palm of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to ſwear upon a book; becauſe, in judicial atteſtations,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0047702200:66"/>
the eſſential part of the form lies in <hi>kiſſing</hi> the book, which the hand may not be improperly ſaid to do, even in laying hold of it. Dr. Johnſon, apparently having a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed idea of a court of juſtice in his head, confounds the action of a criminal holding up his hand at the bar, with that of a witneſs, qualifying himſelf by oath, to give evidence againſt him. The former, indeed, muſt of courſe diſplay the palm; but I believe the latter ſeldom or never does.</p>

                           <l>Unleſs Bellario, a learned doctor,</l>
                           <l>Whom I have ſent for to determine this,</l>
                           <l>Come here to-day.</l>

                           <l>Bellario, a learned doctor,</l>
                           <l>Whom I have ſent for.—</l>
                        </q> The doctor and court are here ſomewhat unſkilfully brought together. That the duke would, on ſuch an occaſion, conſult a doctor of great reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not unlikely; but how ſhould this be foreknown by Portia?</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Why will you, Dr. Johnſon, be thus conſtantly ſeeking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to find fault with Shakeſpeare, for miſconduct in his drama; the buſineſs of which you are evidently much too <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilled</hi> in to have a right to take upon you the authority of cenſuring the <hi>foremoſt man of all this world?</hi>—You admit it to be right that Dr. Bellario, whom we may very well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be a civilian of the firſt rank, ſhould be ſent for, to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0047702200:67"/>
adviſe in this cauſe. You know too, I imagine (or at leaſt you might have known, if you had read the play) that this ſame Dr. Bellario (for he was a doctor too; WE are all doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Dr. Johnſon) was a relation, a couſin, to Portia. This being premiſed, is it not very natural to ſuppoſe that, after Baſſanio was called away in ſuch haſte to Venice, on account of the proſecution carried on againſt his friend Anthonio, his bride Portia would ſend a meſſenger to her couſin Bellario, in order to aſk his opinion of ſo extraordinary a caſe, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt him in Anthonio's behalf? And can any thing be more probable than that he ſhould inform her, on receiving ſuch a meſſage, that he was actually ſent for to Venice on that very account? For it is to be obſerved, that the duke ſpeaks as if he had ſent for him ſome conſiderable time before: for he ſays, <hi>unleſs Bellario,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>come here to</hi> DAY. His power of diſmiſſing the court alſo, on his not coming, ſeems founded on ſome phyſical or moral impediment, that might very naturally occur, to prevent his arrival within the time: ſo that he muſt be ſuppoſed either at ſuch a diſtance as made it neceſſary to give him a conſiderable timely warning, or that the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary nature of the cauſe might make him require ſo much the more time to prepare himſelf equitably to determine it.—This being the ſtate of the caſe, was not here a very apt foundation on which to build Portia's plot of officiating for the doctor? which deſign ſhe no doubt concerted with him by letter, before ſhe ſent for the notes and cloaths mentioned ſcene V. act III. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>It may not be amiſs to obſerve here, that I have known ſome ſpectators impute the device, by which Anthonio evades the penalty of the bond, to the ingenuity of Portia.—Perhaps this is the caſe, indeed, with the audience in general.—But, as I think it a little out of character, in a young lady of her education, to be ſo well verſed in the quirks and quibbles of the law; ſo I conceive there is ſufficient reaſon given in the play to ſuppoſe that evaſion to have been ſuggeſted by Bellario.—For ſhe expreſly mentions to the meſſenger <hi>notes</hi> and <hi>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                                 <desc>•••</desc>
                              </gap>aths.</hi> Theſe notes were, doubtleſs, the brief or hints for her pleading. And Bellario ſays in his letter to the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0047702200:68"/>duke, ſpeaking of the fictitious doctor,
<q>he is furniſhed with my opinion.</q>
So that I am ſo far from thinking that Shakeſpeare, as Dr. Johnſon ſuppoſes, repreſents Portia to be a propheteſs, or a witch, that I conceive his readers in general are apt to think her much more ſhrewd than he deſcribes her; at leaſt, I dare ſay, Dr. Johnſon's readers will conclude, from this ſpecimen of his ſagacity, that whether Portia was a witch or not, he is no conjurer.</p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0047702200:67"/>
                     </note>—And that this was really the caſe ſeems
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0047702200:68"/>
evident, from what Portia ſays to Jeſſica, <hi>during</hi> the <hi>abſence</hi> of Baſſanio, and <hi>before</hi> ſhe ſends Balthazar to Bellario for the notes and clothes.—Jeſſica compliments her on
<q>
                        <l>—a noble and a true conceit</l>
                        <l>Of god-like amity; which appears moſt ſtrongly</l>
                        <l>In bearing thus the abſence of her lord.</l>
                     </q>
A ſufficient intimation, I think, that Baſſanio muſt have been gone ſome time. Again, in Portia's reply to this compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe ſays
<q>
                        <l>—this Anthonio,</l>
                        <l>Being the boſom-lover of my lord,</l>
                        <l>Muſt needs be like my lord. If it be ſo,</l>
                        <l>How little is the coſt I have beſtowed,</l>
                        <l>In purchaſing the ſemblance of my ſoul</l>
                        <l>From out the ſtate of helliſh cruelty?</l>
                     </q>
Here we find Portia ſpeaking very peremptorily and certainly of Anthonio's deliverance; and of the coſt already beſtowed to effect it. Is it reaſonable to think ſhe would expreſs herſelf thus confidently on a mere ſuggeſtion of her own? Beſides, what coſt could ſhe have beſtowed? Her having bid her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band pay the bond three times over, was nothing; becauſe ſhe could not be ſure the money would be taken. Nay, ſhe evidently does not intend to truſt to that acceptance. It is therefore, I think, very evident, that ſhe had even at this time concerted the ſcheme with her couſin Bellario. How far Belmont might be from either Venice or Padua, I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſay: but it appears from circumſtances, that it could not be very far. From Belmont to Venice it ſeems there was a common traject, or ferry; ſo that the diſtance of both from Padua could not be too great for tranſacting the buſineſs
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0047702200:69"/>
in queſtion.—It is true, that the formality with which Port a introduces her charge to Balthazar, when ſhe ſends him for the notes and cloaths, ſeems to favour the ſuppoſition, that this was the firſt time ſhe had ſent to Bellario, in which caſe there would be ſome grounds for Dr. Johnſon's remark; but we muſt obſerve, that Balthazar is now to be intruſted with a more important charge than he had before been, in merely carrying and bringing back a letter; or, it is not unlikely, that Portia entruſted that buſineſs with a ſervant of leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. All theſe things duly conſidered, it is plain, I think, that Dr. Johnſon has very raſhly and unadviſedly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to call Shakeſpeare <hi>unſkilful,</hi> becauſe he wanted <hi>ſkill</hi> himſelf. I ſhall diſmiſs this note, therefore, with adviſing our editor never to wade ſo far out of his depth for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is a trite adage, but it is a very good one, and worthy to be obſerved; <hi>Ne ſutor ultra crepidam.</hi> I do not ſay that Dr. Johnſon may not probably be well ſkilled in <hi>ſome</hi> things; not that <hi>I know</hi> that he is well ſkilled in any <note n="*" place="bottom">I will except indeed the article of <hi>literary compoſition</hi>; in which, ſo far as the merit of a ſpeech, an eſſay, a life, or a novel, goes, he is undoubtedly the beſt writer in Chriſtendom. But his merit even here is in a great meaſure mechanical, and may be juſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for in a manner that will do little honour either to his boaſted genius or learning.</note>; for, though I have read <hi>all</hi> his <hi>works,</hi> I declare he does not appear to me (at leaſt ſo far as I myſelf am able to judge) to be <hi>maſter</hi> of any <hi>one ſcience,</hi> or any <hi>one language,</hi> ſo that he muſt not plume himſelf on <hi>my</hi> ſuffrage. Not that I <hi>deny</hi> him to be maſter of the <hi>whole circle of ſciences,</hi> and of <hi>all languages an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern.</hi> But, if it <hi>be</hi> ſo; if it be really <hi>true,</hi> as his friends inform me, that he is poſſeſſed of ſuch amazing ſtores of literary and ſcientific knowledge, I cannot help thinking him extremely culpable, not to ſay very ungrateful, to keep them all avariciouſly to himſelf, and fob off the public with mere ſhreds and patches. How <hi>dare</hi> Dr. Johnſon treat <hi>that public</hi> with ſo much <hi>contempt,</hi> which hath done <hi>him</hi> ſuch extravagant
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0047702200:70"/>
                     <hi>honour?</hi> How dare he behave to that public with ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralell'd ingratitude, which hath given him ſuch imparalell'd, ſuch avowed, ſuch unmerited encouragement?—It is true, that its having done all this is ſufficient to give Dr. Johnſon a very mean opinion of its ſpirit, taſte and judgment. But he ſhould have been aware of carrying the impoſition too far; he ſhould not have preſumed to think that this public, taſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ignorant as he may ſuppoſe it, could ever be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on to grace his waving noddle with a wreath, irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently torn from the brows of Shakeſpeare!</p>
                  <p>The ſelf-ſufficient, the arrogant, Dr. Johnſon may poſſibly conceive, that the zeal, with which the very name of Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare inſpires me, is counterfeited; and that I expreſs myſelf thus warmly, to provoke him to a reply.—No, Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, you <hi>cannot reply.</hi> I muſt join in that deference, which I think the world hath undeſervedly paid you, ſo far as to own, that I ſhould never have preſumed to publiſh any thing againſt Dr. Johnſon, that I had not good reaſon to think UNANSWERABLE. It is indeed prudential in <hi>you</hi> to make a virtue of neceſſity, and previouſly to give out, that you <hi>will</hi> not do what you have ſo much reaſon to think you <hi>can</hi> not do.—Yet you have your ſatellites, your light-troops; you may ſend them out to <hi>harraſs</hi> the enemy whom you <hi>dare</hi> not <hi>encounter.</hi> But, as I am no farther your enemy than as you are Shakeſpeare's, ſend <hi>who</hi> you will, <hi>as many</hi> as you will; I will undertake, under ſo gallant a leader, to rout an army of ſcribblers, to cruſh a myriad of cockle-ſhell critics, in his cauſe.</p>

                        <hi>None but a holy hermit.</hi>] I do not perceive the uſe of this hermit, of whom nothing is ſeen or heard afterwards.

                  </q>
                  <p>How! the poet blundering again!—Why, what a block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head this Shakeſpeare muſt be, Dr. Johnſon? eh!—Nay, if you object to giving the appellation to Shakeſpeare, we muſt beſtow it on ſomebody elſe; the word is blurted out, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be recalled. Let us ſee if it will <hi>apply,</hi> as the lawyers ſay, to the author of the above comment.—</p>
                  <p>He doth not perceive the uſe of the hermit, becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſeen or heard of him afterwards.—Pray is any thing <hi>ſeen</hi> of him <hi>now?</hi> He is not brought on the ſcene; and may, for ought that effects the buſineſs of the play, exiſt only in <hi>nubibus.</hi> There is no doubt that the meſſenger tells a lye, reſpecting the <hi>employment</hi> of his miſtreſs; and why may he not do the ſame reſpecting her <hi>attendants?</hi>—But perhaps the commentator may not ſee the uſe of the fiction neither, and will therefore condemn this part of the meſſenger's lye as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary. He would do well to recollect, however, that, although nothing is heard about a hermit <hi>afterwards,</hi> a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon was given <hi>before</hi> to ſpeak of one in this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; which is evidently a contrivance of Portia to ſupport the impoſition ſhe is carrying on. It is to be remembered that, when Portia takes her leave of Lorenzo and Jeſſica, putting the management of her houſe and family in their hands, act III. ſcene 5. ſhe ſays
<q>
                        <l>—For mine own part,</l>
                        <l>I have tow'rd heaven breath'd a ſecret vow,</l>

                        <l>And there we will abide.</l>
                     </q>
Now, having told them this fib at her departure, nothing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0047702200:72"/>
could be more pertinent, or indeed neceſſary, to keep up the probability of the ſtory, than for the meſſenger to ſay, ſhe was attended by a hermit; as it would be both unſeemly and dangerous for two women <hi>to ſtray about, kneeling and praying by holy croſſes,</hi> without a male attendant; and who ſo proper on ſuch an occaſion as an holy hermit, whoſe ſacred character might protect them from inſult?—This is ſufficient to ſhew, that it was not unneceſſary, but very pertinent to the plot, to have a hermit here ſpoken of; which is all the poet hath done.—Add to this, that, after all, it is poſſible there might really be a hermit in the caſe, though it was needleſs that he ſhould appear. For the meſſenger himſelf might not be in the plot, and Portia have employed a hermit to deliver him the meſſage from Portia, as he actually did deliver it to Lorenzo; unleſs we are to ſuppoſe that holy hermits are too inflexibly attached to truth, to aſſiſt even in ſo innocent an impoſture: which I, who have had the honour of knowing ſome of thoſe gentry, conceive not to be the caſe.</p>

                  <p>There cannot, I think, be a more flagrant inſtance of that perverſity of apprehenſion, which ſeems to have diſtinguiſhed almoſt all our poet's commentators, than the difficulty they have raiſed about this paſſage. It is true they have in general been much more ſucceſsful in throwing obſtructions in the way of the reader, than in obviating thoſe which common ſenſe and ſimple ingenuity might naturally ſuggeſt. For my part, I ſhould never have dreamt that theſe verſes ſo greatly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0047702200:73"/>
needed illuſtration, that they were corrupted, or that a line was loſt and badly reſtored, unleſs the learned Dr. Warburton had told me of the firſt, the ingenious and ſenſible authors of the Canons of Criticiſm and of the Reviſal had inſinuated the ſecond, and laſtly, the learned, ingenious and ſenſible Dr. Johnſon attempted to perſuade me of the third. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they have all ſucceſsfully laboured to throw ſome obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity on the text, Mr. Edwards not excepted; for, though he hath facetiouſly and juſtly expoſed Dr. Warburton's ridiculous emendation of the fifth line, he hath left the reader to explain the paſſage himſelf, after aſſuring him that it certainly is faulty.</p>
                  <p>It will, I preſume, afford ſome entertainment to the reader to compare the ſeveral notes of theſe annotators; by which they will ſee how they have all blundered round-about the poet's meaning; perhaps for no other reaſon in the world than that they imagined it lay much deeper than it really does. It is not an uncommon thing for perſons immoderately ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to look too far forward, and ſtumble over what lies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately under their noſe. Dr. Johnſon appears, indeed, to have a very different opinion of this matter; and ſeems to think that Shakeſpeare's meaning is always very profound. Thus he tells us,
<q>the original and predominant error of Dr. Warburton's Commentary, is acquieſcence in his firſt thoughts; that precipitation which is produced by conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of quick diſcernment; and that confidence which preſumes to do, by ſurveying the ſurface, what labour only can perform, by <hi>penetrating the bottom</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">See Preface to Dr. Johnſon's Shakeſpeare.</note>.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For my part, I had always a very different opinion of Dr. Warburton's Commentary. That he did too precipitately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in his own thoughts, may be very true; and that he ſurveyed only the ſurface of Shakeſpeare's writing may be no leſs ſo; but that he went very deep into the receſſes of his own imagination, as well as into his ſtores of book-learning,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0047702200:74"/>
for all thoſe far-fetched alluſions, quaint epithets and literary conundrums, which he imputes to Shakeſpeare, is, I think, not to be doubted. For it is very true, as our editor alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that
<q>his notes exhibit perverſe interpretations and improbable conjectures; he at one time gives the author more profundity of meaning than the ſentence admits, and at another diſcovers abſurdities, where the ſenſe is plain to every other reader <note n="*" place="bottom">See Preface to Dr. Johnſon's Shakeſpeare.</note>.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is very natural to conclude, from this reprehenſion, that Dr. Johnſon means to inſinuate his having himſelf repaired the faults of Dr. Warburton, and effected that by perſeverance and labour, which the reverend ſcholiaſt, his predeceſſor, failed to do by his vivacity and precipitation. It is certain, that <hi>labour</hi> neceſſarily takes up <hi>time</hi>; and ſo far the frequent procraſtination of the preſent edition affords Dr. Johnſon a plauſible excuſe for pretending to have laboured: but, on the other hand, it is as certain that <hi>time</hi> doth not neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>labour</hi>; for, it is notorious that an induſtrious gerund-grinder may do as much or more in a month, than an <hi>idler</hi> will do in ſeven years. It is alſo farther certain that, although youth and inexperience may be too haſty and precipitate, yet experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and age cannot well execute their work too expeditiouſly; in the former caſe delay may ſerve to correct errors, and check the inordinance and exuberance of zeal; in the latter, it produces only languor and perplexity. Thus if Dr. Johnſon, inſtead of ſpiritedly repairing the neglect of thoſe who only <hi>ſurveyed</hi> the <hi>ſurface,</hi> had boldly and immediately <hi>penetrated</hi> to <hi>the bottom,</hi> all had poſſibly been right: but, inſtead of doing this, it appears he hath been full as much too tardy as they were precipitate; and thus, leaving the weight of his learning, and the force of his reputation, to work their way without the leaſt application of genius, he hath ſuffered them, by long and conſtant fric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to perforate or to <hi>penetrate,</hi> as he ſays, <hi>the bottom</hi> itſelf. So that the ſuperficial meanings, which former editors ſkimmed from the top, are left hanging about the ſides of the veſſel;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0047702200:75"/>
while the profound diſcoveries, weighty arguments, and ſtriking illuſtrations, expected in the preſent edition, are all eſcaped through the hole which Dr. Johnſon's modeſt induſtry and vaſt erudition have worked through the bottom.</p>
                  <p>But, to leave this digreſſion, and return to the notes of the ſeveral commentators. Dr. Warburton's, as it is inſerted by way of preference, no doubt, in the page before us, runs thus:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <l>Thy tooth is not ſo keen,</l>
                           <l>Becauſe thou art not ſeen,</l>
                        </q> This ſong is deſigned to ſuit the duke's exiled condition, who had been ruined by <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful flatterers.</hi> Now the <hi>winter wind,</hi> the ſong ſays, is to be preferred to <hi>man's ingratitude.</hi> But why? <hi>Becauſe it is not</hi> SEEN. But this was not only an aggravation of the injury, as it was done in ſecret, <hi>not ſeen,</hi> but was the very circumſtance that made the keenneſs of the ingratitude of his faithleſs courtiers. Without doubt Shakeſpeare wrote the line thus,
<q>
                           <l>Becauſe thou art not <hi>SHEEN,</hi>
                           </l>
                        </q>
i. e. ſmiling, and ſhining, like an ungrateful court-ſervant, who flatters while he wounds, which was a very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for giving the <hi>winter wind</hi> the preference. So in the Midſummer Night's Dream,
<q>
                           <l>Spangled ſtar light <hi>SHEEN;</hi>
                           </l>
                        </q>
and ſeveral other places. Chaucer uſes it in this ſenſe,
<q>
                           <l>Your bliſsful ſuſter Lucina the <hi>SHENE.</hi>
                           </l>
                        </q>
And Fairfax,
<q>
                           <l>The ſacred angel took his target <hi>SHENE,</hi>
                           </l>
                           <l>And by the Chriſtian champion ſtood unſeen.</l>
                        </q>
The Oxford editor, who had this emendation communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him, takes occaſion from thence to alter the whole line thus,
<q>
                           <l>Thou cauſeſt not that teen.</l>
                        </q>
But, in his rage of correction, he forgot to leave the reaſon, which is now wanting. Why the <hi>winter wind</hi> was to be preferred to <hi>man's ingratitude.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0047702200:76"/>On this curious comment, the author of the Canons of Criticiſm hath made the following remarks:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>This paſſage [meaning the two lines quoted from the text] is certainly faulty; and perhaps it cannot be reſtored, as Shakeſpeare gave it. Sir Thomas Hanmer at laſt altered it into ſenſe;
<q>Thou cauſeſt not that teen.</q>
But this, it ſeems, will not do; becauſe, in <hi>his rage of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> he forgot to leave the reaſon, why the <hi>winter wind</hi> was to be preferred to man's ingratitude. So now Mr. Warburton comes with his emendation, which he charit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably communicated to Sir Thomas, though he was ſo graceleſs as not to make uſe of it.
<q>Becauſe thou art not <hi>SHEEN.</hi>
                        </q>
Though this matter is ſo clear with Mr. Warburton, every body who underſtands Engliſh will doubt of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe SHEEN ſignifies bright, which makes no better ſenſe than ſeen; nor does he produce any authority for its ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying SMILING, which is the ſenſe he here puts upon it; and to make it paſs the better, he lugs in a parcel of <hi>"ſmiling, ſhining, court ſervants, who flatter while they wound,</hi>" of whom there is not the leaſt hint in the ſong, or in the whole ſcene.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Mr. Edwards then goes on to enumerate Dr. Warbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's examples, which having quoted above, need not be repeated.—He proceeds—
<q>Theſe are the examples he produces; <hi>whether wiſely or not, let the foreſt judge</hi>; but the conceit of a <hi>ſmiling target</hi> is entirely his own; and, if be will allow me a pun <hi>invita Minerva</hi>; for it ſeems in direct oppoſition to the famed Aegis of Pallas. But this is hardly a laughing matter: for with what face can he ſay <hi>ſmiling, ſhining</hi>—ſo Shakeſpeare.—Chaucer uſes it in this ſenſe,—and Fairfax—when, if he knows any thing of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, he muſt know, that not one of them, in theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, uſes <hi>ſheen</hi> in the ſenſe of SMILING; and that, in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0047702200:77"/>
its true ſenſe of BRIGHT or ſhining, it would make the paſſage worſe than he found it?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If Sir Thomas Hanmer, as he ſays, took occaſion, from having this emendation communicated to him, to alter the whole line; he ſhewed more judgment than if he had inſerted ſuch a falſe and nonſenſical note; but, "in his rage of correction, he forgot to leave the reaſon, why the winter wind was to be preferred to <hi>man's ingratitude.</hi>" If SHEEN does not ſignify <hi>ſmiling,</hi> I doubt Mr. Warburton will be in the ſame caſe. However Shakeſpeare has equally forgotten, in the next ſtanza, to leave the reaſon why a freezing ſky is to be preferred to a <hi>forgetful friend</hi>; which, perhaps, may give a reaſonable ſuſpicion that the word <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">This ingenious writer does not intimate what he thinks might be the right word; but if he be right in his ſuſpicion, I conceive that, inſtead of the conjunction copulative <hi>becauſe,</hi> Shakeſpeare muſt uſe the adverb or prepoſition disjunctive <hi>beſide.</hi>
                        </note>, in the firſt ſtanza, may be corrupt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The author of the REVISAL of <hi>Shakeſpeare's Text,</hi> ſays,
<q>What the meaning of the common reading,
<q>Becauſe thou art not SEEN,</q>
may be, it is extremely difficult to diſcover, which gives great ground for ſuſpicion that it may be corrupt. Poſſibly it might be intended to be this: the impreſſions thou makeſt on us are not ſo cutting, becauſe thou art an unſeen agent, with whom we have not the leaſt acquaintance or converſe, and therefore have the leſs reaſon to repine at thy treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To come now to Dr. Johnſon; who, after quoting Dr. Warburton's note, without mentioning a ſyllable of Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards's remarks on it, proceeds thus:
<q>I am afraid that no reader is ſatisfied with Dr. Warburton's emendation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever vigorouſly enforced; and it is indeed enforced with more art than truth. <hi>Sheen,</hi> i. e. <hi>ſmiling, ſhining.</hi> That <hi>ſheen</hi> ſignifies <hi>ſhining,</hi> is eaſily proved; but when or where
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0047702200:78"/>
did it ſignify <hi>ſmiling?</hi> Yet <hi>ſmiling</hi> gives the ſenſe neceſſary in this place. Sir Thomas Hanmer's change is leſs uncouth, but too remote from the preſent text. For my part, I queſtion whether the original is not loſt, and this ſubſtituted merely to fill up the meaſures and the rhyme. Yet even out of this line, by ſtrong agitation, may ſenſe be elicited, and ſenſe not unſuitable to the occaſion. <hi>Thou winter wind,</hi> ſays the duke<note n="*" place="bottom">No, Dr. Johnſon, it is his couſin Amiens <hi>ſings</hi> it.</note>, <hi>thy rudeneſs gives the leſs pain, as thou art not ſeen, as thou art an enemy that doſt not brave us with thy preſence, and whoſe unkindneſs is therefore not aggravated by inſult.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After ſo many avowed aſſurances of the difficulty of the above paſſage, and the unſucceſsful, though elaborate, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to clear it up; it may ſeem affectation in me to inſiſt on its being very obvious. I muſt declare, however, that before I had read any of the above criticiſms, it always ſeemed ſo, though I muſt own I did not take either the particular meaning of the words, or the general deſign of the ſong, in the ſame manner as is done by any of the above-mentioned critics. Dr. Warburton ſeems, indeed, to have miſled them all, by confounding ingratitude with pretended friendſhip or private enmity. That flatterers are often ſecret enemies, and generally ungrateful, is very true; but it is by no means eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to acts of ingratitude that they ſhould be committed in ſecret; and, on the contrary, though it be diſingenuous, mean, and cowardly to do private injuries, it may not be ungrateful; for the doer may happen not be obliged to the perſon offended. With regard alſo to the particular caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, there is no doubt but the baniſhed duke had ſuffered enough from public and <hi>viſible</hi> acts of ingratitude: the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of which would therefore be aggravated, as Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon rightly ſays, by inſult; and would not be, like acts of falſe friendſhip or private enmity, aggravated by being done
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0047702200:79"/>
in ſecret. When Dr. Johnſon, therefore, adopting Dr. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burton's reaſoning, tells us that <hi>ſmiling</hi> gives the ſenſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in this place, he is miſled by the plauſibility of that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's argument; there being no manner of occaſion, as Mr. Edwards obſerves, for the introduction of his flattering courtiers.</p>
                  <p>Having expatiated ſo much on the difficulty and miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the paſſage, I come now to explain it that way in which I have ever underſtood it; and according to which, I think, there is no manner of difficulty in reconciling the ſenſe to the words as they now ſtand. Nay, I flatter myſelf many readers will diſcover more beauty in this admirable lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſong, than they were before acquainted with. Before I enter, however, on the explanation of particular words, I ſhall conſider the deſign and tendency of the ſong in general. To this end it may be neceſſary to repeat the whole.

The reader will obſerve that the <hi>firſt</hi> verſe is addreſſed to the WIND, and the <hi>ſecond</hi> to the SKY; by which latter is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <hi>meant</hi> the air or atmoſphere, as appears by the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes or qualities he imputes to it. It is obſervable, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0047702200:80"/>
that the poet has, with great judgment, kept the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and effects of both diſtinct, beginning with the leaſt hurtful, and proceeding regularly in the climax to the moſt cutting and ſevere.</p>
                  <p>This being premiſed, I come now to the diſputed meaning of the particular words: and here all the ſcholiaſts ſeem to blunder, in miſtaking the ſenſe of the word <hi>keen</hi> in the fourth line; which they take to ſignify <hi>ſharp, cutting, piercing</hi>; whereas it only means <hi>eager, vehement</hi>; a ſenſe equally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the former. The poet ſpeaks here only of a keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of appetite; he does not mention actual biting, till he comes to addreſs a more proper and powerful agent: for, tho' it be the property of the wind to bluſter and make a noiſe, it doth not bite, unleſs it bring with it a nipping froſty air. It does not freeze more in an high wind, than when its breath is neither felt nor heard; but often leſs. Beſides, if <hi>keen</hi> here means <hi>ſharp, piercing,</hi> &amp;c. this line hath the ſame meaning as the ſeventh line of the ſecond verſe, where the poet is at the laſt ſtage of his climax. And I think he would hardly be guilty of ſuch a piece of tautology, in the ſpace of ſo few lines, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the leſs ſevere and powerful agent exactly in the ſame manner as he does that which is more ſo.</p>
                  <p>Taking the word in this ſenſe, let us ſee its effect on the context.</p>
                  <q>Thy tooth is not ſo keen.</q>
                  <p>That is as much as to ſay, <hi>thou art not ſo eager to</hi> bite; <hi>thy appetite is not ſo voracious—thou art not ſo violent to diſtreſs us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Becauſe thou art not ſeen,</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>In other words, <hi>becauſe thou doſt not come in a viſible form to confront us, notwithſtanding thou inſulteſt us with thy abuſive bluſtering.—Thou doſt not ſhew thy grim</hi> LOOKS, <hi>though we hear thy roaring</hi> VOICE <note n="*" place="bottom">Shakeſpeare uſes <hi>breath</hi> for <hi>voice</hi> alſo in the Twelfth-Night; SIR ANDREW AGUE-CHEEK.

It were indeed extremely offenſive to ſee others <hi>ſhew their teeth</hi> at us, even though they could not bite. Perhaps Shakeſpeare had ſome diſtant alluſion to this prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial phraſe: it is alſo obſervable, that the inviſibility of the wind was a circumſtance which this great poet had frequently in his mind. Thus, in Meaſure for Meaſure, he ſpeaks of the <hi>viewleſs</hi> winds; an epithet, I believe, peculiar to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>I now truſt this explanation to the reader's judgment, and ſhould alſo take leave of the ſubject itſelf, were there not an expreſſion in the laſt ſtanza; the beauty of which is, in a great meaſure, loſt, for want of being rightly underſtood.—I have not undertaken, indeed, to ſupply the defects of the commentators; but as this ſong is a favourite, I cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed without making a ſlight animadverſion or two on this head. The expreſſion I mean is,
<q>Though thou the waters WARP.</q>
The word <hi>warp</hi> has been very differently uſed by different writers: it is uſed by ſome to mean <hi>contract</hi> or <hi>ſhrivel,</hi> to <hi>turn aſide,</hi> &amp;c. and a certain lexicographer, in his folio dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary, quotes this very line to ſhew that it is uſed to expreſs the effects of froſt. But may we not pertinently aſk him, what theſe effects are? Does he mean to ſay, that Shakeſpeare hath uſed it here in a ſenſe different from its moſt general and obvious meaning? If he does, he does not underſtand the poet; if he does not, he knows not how to write a dictionary. To <hi>warp,</hi> here means neither to <hi>contract,</hi> nor to <hi>turn aſide</hi>; for the body of water in freezing is dilated, not contracted; and though the froſt may arreſt or ſtop water in its paſſage, I don't know that it alters its courſe.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>waters,</hi> indeed, doth not mean here, as ſome have ſuppoſed, water in the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtract, as a fluid in general; it means alſo neither the waving, <hi>multitudinous,</hi> ſea, nor the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0047702200:82"/>
unfreezing rivers, but ſuch inland pools, lakes, and other ſtagnant or ſlowly-moving pieces of water that are ſubject to be affected by froſt <note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <p>Agreeable to this, when the rivers break down or run over their banks, laying the country under water, we ſay the <hi>waters</hi> are out. When the river is returned again to its channel alſo, the pools remaining behind in the adjacent fields or meadows, are called the <hi>waters.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </note>. Now, it is well known that the ſurface of ſuch <hi>waters,</hi> as is here meant, ſo long as they remain fluid, i. e. unfrozen, is apparently a perfect plane; whereas when they are frozen, this ſurface deviates from its exact flatneſs, or <hi>warps.</hi> This is peculiarly remarkable in ſmall ponds, the ſurface of which, when frozen, forms a regular concave; the ice on the ſides riſing higher than that in the middle. Thus we ſee that Shakeſpeare need not to be obliged to any lexicographer for admitting the latitude of his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as he here uſes the word <hi>warp</hi> in its primitive and moſt general ſignification; to make a thing <hi>caſt</hi> or <hi>bend,</hi> as boards do when they are cut before they are thoroughly dry, or when they are put to the fire.</p>

Inſtead of ſaying, <hi>I will laugh like a hyen, and that when you are inclined to weep</hi>; the <hi>and</hi> ſhould be tranſpoſed, and the word <hi>that</hi> omitted. He ſhould have ſaid, AND <hi>I will</hi> LAUGH <hi>like a hyen, when you are inclined to</hi> WEEP. Suppoſing the text uncorrupted in no other particular, I muſt give my voice, with the editor, for <hi>ſleep.</hi> But I cannot help ſuſpecting that this paſſage is corrupted in a part where none of the commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſeem to think it. It is juſtly to be preſumed, at leaſt, that Dr. Johnſon does not think it ſo, as he paſſes it over, notwithſtanding he aſſures us, in his preface, that he hath left not one paſſage, that he thought obſcure, without attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to elucidate it.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall we ſay to Roſalind's <hi>laughing like a</hi> HYEN? If by a <hi>hyen</hi> is meant an <hi>hyaena,</hi> I do not know what authority we have for its <hi>laughing,</hi> nor can diſcover the propriety of the alluſion. It is reported, indeed, of that furious animal,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0047702200:84"/>
that it will counterfeit a man's voice; nay, call him by his name, to entice him out of doors, in order to devour him; after which he may be ſaid, metaphorically, to <hi>laugh in his ſleeve</hi> at the ſucceſs of his contrivance. But the laughing here alluded to, muſt be neceſſarily ſo loud as to prevent a drowſy man's going to ſleep; and I do not know that any animal in nature is poſſeſſed of the ſtreperous part of riſibility, except <hi>man.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Homo</hi> eſt animal <hi>riſibile,</hi>
                     </q>
and I believe excluſively ſo. Shakeſpeare then can never mean to ſay, <hi>like an hyaena.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>"What then could he mean?"—True, reader, that is the queſtion.—Have but a little patience and I will endeavour to tell you.—Shakeſpeare, with all his diverſity of action and character, is generally very uniform and conſtant in his train of thinking. He does not chop his metaphors into fritters; nor ſkip giddily and alternately from the alluſions of art to thoſe of nature, or vicê verſâ. The reader will pleaſe to obſerve, that, in the preceding line, and in this very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, he mentions <hi>Diana.</hi> Now, it is not at all like Shakeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to fly off immediately from this claſſical alluſion, to ſo diſtant a one as any afforded by natural hiſtory; even ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing there were not that impropriety in it as I have above noticed.</p>
                  <p>I would venture, after the modiſh way of deciding argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to lay a good bet, if it could be determined, that Shakeſpeare wrote thus;</p>
                  <p>—<hi>I will</hi> WEEP <hi>for nothing like</hi> DIANA <hi>in the fountain; and I will do that, when you are diſpoſed to be</hi> MERRY: <hi>I will</hi> LAUGH <hi>like a</hi> HYAD, <hi>and that when you are inclined to</hi> SLEEP.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>laugh</hi> in the laſt part of the ſentence being uſed, by way of irony, for CRY; thus we ironically ſay, <hi>to laugh like Heraclitus,</hi> the weeping philoſopher <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Or, according to the vulgar phraſe, to <hi>laugh on the wrong ſide of the mouth.</hi> But if any of my readers ſhould make objections to the ſuppoſed uſe of the figure above-mentioned, and be willing to look over the defect of conſtruction in the text, in favour of Dr. Warburton's propoſed alteration, they may take the word in its natural ſenſe; in which caſe, <hi>to laugh like a</hi> HYAD, would mean, as another vulgar phraſe has it, to <hi>laugh till ſhe cries.</hi> In either caſe, however, it muſt be <hi>hyad,</hi> and not <hi>hyen</hi>: this latter reading being entirely excluded for the reaſons above given. By ſubſtituting the former alſo we make both the alluſions claſſical, and preſerve that conformity of thinking, which is perfectly agreeable to the genius of Shakeſpeare; who, it is very poſſible, came from reading Ovid, to compoſe many ſcenes in this play. It is certain his head was ſo full of him, that he mentions his very name in one of the ſcenes, where neither the occaſion, nor the turn of the dialogue, gave the leaſt room for it. <hi>I am here with thee and thy goats, as the moſt capricious poet, honeſt Ovid, was among the Goths.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </note>: ſo that to <hi>laugh like a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0047702200:85"/>
hyad,</hi> is to <hi>ſob and blubber like one of the hyads.</hi> Now <hi>hyads,</hi> or <hi>hyades,</hi> is an appellation given to the conſtellation, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called the <hi>ſeven ſtars,</hi> and ſupoſed to be a watery ſign; whence their denomination from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, i. e. to rain. The poets feign theſe <hi>hyads</hi> to have been the daughters of Atlas and Aethra; and pretend that <hi>Hyas,</hi> their brother, having been torn to pieces by a lioneſs, they wept ſo vehemently for his death, that the gods, in compaſſion to them, tranſlated them to heaven, and placed them in the forehead of the bull, where they ſtill continue to weep: whence the conſtellation is ſuppoſed by ſome to preſage rain.</p>
                  <p>I am well aware, that ſome of my readers will think this comment written rather too much in the <hi>Warburtonian</hi> ſtrain <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>It is not impoſſible alſo, that ſome ſuperficial critics may think, that a man could not be kept awake by a woman's weeping. But certainly, if ſhe blubbered and roared heartily, and out of ſpite, as is here ſuppoſed, he might as well be kept awake by her <hi>crying</hi> as her <hi>laughing.</hi> Beſides, if we reflect on the ſhrewd veracity of the old proverb, that ſays,
<q>Women <hi>laugh</hi> when they <hi>can,</hi> and <hi>weep</hi> when they <hi>will</hi>;</q>
I conceive that Roſalind, in mentioning the ſeveral acts of her <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi> ſpeaks only of her <hi>weeping.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </note>. But, if it be juſt and pertinent, I think this ſhould be no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection

to it; for, though Dr. Warburton's comments on Shakeſpeare are ſeldom to the purpoſe, and therefore do not always deſerve our approbation, they are generally learned, and never fail to excite our <hi>admiration,</hi> either on account of their actual <hi>ingenuity</hi> or moſt palpable <hi>abſurdity.</hi>

—Happy is it for the memory of Shakeſpeare, and as happy for his diſcerning readers, that the veneration paid to his name ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the hand of the commentator from executing thoſe deſigns which his temerity conceives. What work would not a critic, of leſs modeſty than our editor, make of this paſſage, ſhould he take it in his head to ſupply what is thus ſuppoſed wanting? Yet how eaſily is the whole ſet right! It can hardly be called a <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> that Shakeſpeare wrote <hi>tho</hi>' inſtead of <hi>then</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">That a tranſcriber might make ſuch a miſtake, is alſo as likely, as that he ſhould write <hi>tho</hi>' for <hi>then,</hi> as, Dr. Johnſon ſuppoſes, is done in King John, page 410.</note>. It is obvious he muſt, as he plays on the word <hi>good</hi> all through the paſſage, not once introducing the epithet <hi>bad,</hi> made uſe of by Dr. Johnſon, nor hinting at the antitheſis, which the editor conceives ſo neceſſary to the ſenſe. <hi>Tho</hi>', at the end of a ſentence, is commonly uſed in diſcourſe for <hi>however,</hi> and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0047702200:87"/>
has the ſame meaning as <hi>but</hi> at the beginning of it. Thus it is the ſame thing as if the ſpeaker had ſaid, BUT <hi>what a caſe am I in, &amp;c.</hi> Let the reader ſubſtitute theſe words for <hi>what a caſe am I in</hi> THEN, and I dare ſay he will conceive with me there is no chaſm in the paſſage; but that it ſtands as Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare wrote it. Be this, however, as it may, what is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Dr. Johnſon is entirely foreign to the purpoſe. It does by no means follow that, becauſe <hi>good wine needs no buſh,</hi> bad wine requires a good one. Good wine will recommend itſelf, and ſell without a buſh; but we do not thence infer, that the goodneſs of any buſh can recommend or ſell bad wine.—The Bermudans, I am told, when they go fiſhing, never trouble themſelves to carry any oil or butter for ſauce; for if they catch a fat fiſh it <hi>requires</hi> none, and if they catch a lean one it <hi>deſerves</hi> none.—Shakeſpeare, I fancy, by ſaying nothing about either bad wine or bad plays, reaſoned about them both as the Bermudans do about their fiſh.</p>

                  <p>Dr. Warburton and Dr. Johnſon, having both exerted their critical abilities on this paſſage, and, as I think, left it worſe than they found it, I ſhall inſert the annotations of both, as I find them printed in the pages before me.</p>
                  <q>

                           <l>And every god-father can give a name.</l>
                        </q> The firſt line in this reading is abſurd and impertinent. There are two ways of ſetting it right. The firſt is to read thus,
<q>Too much to know is to know nought but <hi>SHAME.</hi>
                        </q>
This makes a fine ſenſe, and alludes to Adam's fall, which came from the inordinate paſſion of knowing too much. The other way is to read, and point it thus,
<q>Too much to know, is to know nought: but <hi>FEIGN, i. e.</hi> to feign.</q>
As much as to ſay, the affecting to know too much is the way to know nothing. The ſenſe in both theſe readings is equally good: but with this difference; if we read the firſt way, the following line is impertinent, and, to ſave the correction, we muſt judge it ſpurious. If we read it the ſecond way, then the following line compleats the ſenſe. Conſequently the correction of <hi>feign</hi> is to be preferred. <hi>To know too much</hi> (ſays the ſpeaker) <hi>is to know nothing; it is only</hi> FEIGNING <hi>to know what we do not; giving</hi> NAMES <hi>for things without knowing their</hi> NATURES; <hi>which is</hi> FALSE <hi>knowledge</hi>: and this was the peculiar defect of the peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetic philoſophy then in vogue. Theſe philoſophers, the poet, with the higheſt humour and good ſenſe, calls <hi>the god-fathers of nature,</hi> who could only give things a <hi>name,</hi> but had no manner of acquaintance with their eſſences.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>On the above annotation, Dr. Johnſon obſerves,
<q>that there being <hi>two ways of ſetting a paſſage right,</hi> gives reaſon to ſuſpect that there may be a third way better than either. The firſt of theſe emendations <hi>makes a fine ſenſe,</hi> but will not unite with the next line; the other makes a ſenſe leſs fine, and yet will not rhyme to the correſpondent word. I cannot ſee why the paſſage may not ſtand without diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance. <hi>The conſequence,</hi> ſays Biron, <hi>of too much knowledge,</hi> is not any real ſolution of doubts, but mere empty <hi>repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>

                           <p>In our editor's appendix, ſpeaking of this paſſage, he points, reads, and explains thus;

                                 <l>And every god-father can give a name.</l>

                              <q>That is, too much knowledge gives only fame, a name which every god-father can give likewiſe.</q>

                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0047702200:89"/>The author of the Reviſal hath a very long note on this paſſage; rejecting the emendations propoſed by Dr. Warbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and ſeeming to coincide with the opinion of Dr. Johnſon. His explanation of the paſſage is this.
<q>Too eager a purſuit of knowledge is rewarded, not with the real poſſeſſion of its object, but only with the reputation of having attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is really ſurprizing to me, that theſe ſeveral critics ſhould be ſo much at a loſs to comprehend, what I conceive the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text renders very plain; without making any alteration in the text, as it ſtood before Dr. Warburton meddled with it, viz.
<q>
                        <l>Too much to know, is to know nought but fame;</l>
                        <l>And every god-father can give a name.</l>
                     </q>
I cannot imagine what put it into the head of Dr. Johnſon, or of the author of the Reviſal, that <hi>fame</hi> here means <hi>repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> And, ſuppoſing it does, what can Dr. Johnſon mean by ſaying, that <hi>too much knowledge gives only fame, a name which every god-father can give likewiſe?</hi> What, becauſe every god-father can call a child N or M, is he able therefore to give him a literary reputation <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>This puts me in mind of a certain French bookſeller; who, ſpeaking of the profeſſion to which he intended to bring up an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant booby of a ſon; <hi>By-gar,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Monſieur, I will make him one author; he ſhall be the firſt writer of the age.

                     </q>

                        <l>And every god-father can give a name.</l>
                     </q>
To all which the king replies, by obſerving to another noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, how well Biron is <hi>read,</hi>
                     <q>—to reaſon againſt READING.</q>
Hence, I think it is plain that Biron means, through the whole paſſage, to inculcate a maxim, which is undoubtedly a very true one, viz. that the greateſt readers are not the moſt ſcientific; the knowledge of things and of words being as different, as the ſtudy of nature and the plodding over books. From the latter, people may acquire a heap of indigeſted lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, without having any real knowledge at all: indeed, their too great attention to philological purſuits, or to words, often prevents their knowing any thing of philoſophy or of things. Add to this, that the knowledge acquired from books, is, for the moſt part, founded on the authority of the writer, and what is thus known, is known only by <hi>report</hi> or <hi>relation.</hi> So that thoſe, whoſe whole ſtock of knowledge conſiſts in what they have read, merely in the learned lumber of their memory, may, with great propriety, be ſaid to know nothing but what is told them; that is, to be entirely ignorant of <hi>facts,</hi> and <hi>to know nothing but</hi> FAME It would be abſurd alſo, to the laſt degree, to ſay, that <hi>to know</hi> TOO MUCH <hi>would be to know</hi> NOTHING, if no difference in the kind of knowledge was intended. Again, the laſt line of Biron's ſpeech evidently refers to what he had juſt before ſaid, concerning the <hi>baſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0047702200:91"/>
authority</hi> of books. The authors can give <hi>names,</hi> ſays he, to things; inſtancing thoſe,
<q>That give a name to every fixed ſtar,</q>
though they profit no more by them, and know nothing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about them, than thoſe who are ignorant of thoſe names. And this being all they can do, he may well call their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings <hi>baſe authority,</hi> and ſay that any body can do as much, for
<q>—Every god-father can give a <hi>name,</hi>
                     </q>
which is as much at leaſt as aſtronomers do by the ſtars.</p>
                  <p>The author of the Reviſal ſeems to think the word <hi>fame,</hi> in this place, hath ſome reference to the king's ſpeech at the commencement of the play; when he propoſes <hi>reputation</hi> as the principal aim and motive of their ſtudies.

But admitting this, I cannot ſee any reaſon to think that <hi>fame,</hi> in the paſſage diſputed, hath preciſely the ſame meaning as in that juſt quoted, unleſs both ſpeeches had been ſpoken by the king.—It is not unlikely that this paſſage refers to the <hi>fame</hi> recommended by the king; but it is very unlikely that the ſpeaker ſhould affect to ſet a greater value on <hi>knowledge</hi> than on that <hi>fame,</hi> which was at firſt propoſed as the ultimate end to be attained by it.—It is, in my opinion, more than probable that Biron the ſpeaker, who is evidently a wit, and rails at book-learning, takes the advantage here of the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal uſe of the word <hi>fame</hi>; to ſneer at the king's propoſing celebrity as the end of his ſtudies: in which caſe the conteſted line might be paraphraſed thus; <hi>To ſpend all your time in getting to know only the</hi> names <hi>of things, and what others report about
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0047702200:92"/>
them, is the way to get</hi> nothing <hi>elſe but</hi> fame <hi>ſure enough!</hi> Indeed, Biron ſeems to be a man of ſuch a kidney, as to reaſon about <hi>literary fame</hi> as Falſtaff does about <hi>military ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and could eaſily reſolve it in like manner by a trim reckoning, into a very word, air, a mere empty <hi>report.</hi>

                  <p>Dr. Johnſon tells us in his preface, that, when he inſerts any of Dr. Warburton's propoſed emendations in the text, he means to give them his higheſt approbation. Now, this he hath done in the preſent inſtance; giving that ſcholiaſt's note likewiſe at the bottom of the page. The note is as follows:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>—<hi>Taken</hi> WITH <hi>the manner.</hi>] The following queſtion ariſing from theſe words, ſhews we ſhould read—<hi>taken</hi> IN <hi>the manner.</hi> And this was the phraſe in uſe to ſignify <hi>taken in the fact.</hi> So Dr. Donne, in his letters, <hi>But if I melt into melancholy while I write, I ſhall be taken</hi> IN <hi>the manner; and I ſit by one too tender to theſe impreſſions.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The author of the Canons of Criticiſm, however, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validated what Dr. Warburton advances in this place, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of his own notes on a paſſage in the firſt part of Henry the Fourth, where the ſame expreſſion occurs; and on which the ſame reverend commentator ſays:
<q>The quarto and folio read <hi>with the manner,</hi> which is right. <hi>Taken with the manner</hi> is a law phraſe, and then in uſe to ſignify <hi>taken in the fact.</hi>
                     </q>
—Mr. Edwards obſerved, on remarking this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency, that "Great wits have ſhort memories." But I am at ſome loſs to know to what I ſhould impute Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's <hi>giving the higheſt approbation</hi> to this blunder of Dr. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burton's. That his memory is at leaſt as bad, and his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion full as little, is evident from his quoting both theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0047702200:93"/>
notes in their reſpective places, and his giving the higheſt approbation to both the contradictory emendations, by inſerting them in the text; one in the play before us, and the other in that of Henry IV. Notwithſtanding the inconſiſtency had been pointed out in a book, that hath run through at leaſt ſix editions. To what can we impute ſuch ſervile tranſcription? Shall we ſet it down among Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's other conceſſions to the <hi>reſpect due to high place, and his veneration for genius and learning?</hi> Or ſhall we rather impute it to his indolence in not conſulting the Canons of Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm?—Or perhaps he would neither chuſe to depend on the authority of that writer, nor even on Dr. Warburton's himſelf, againſt the united ſuffrage of Dr. Warburton and Dr. Donne. He might have depended, however, on the farther authority of Shakeſpeare; which he might have had by turning over a few pages more of the volume before us; the Clown in the Winter's Tale uſing the ſame phraſe, thus, <hi>Your worſhip had like to have given us one, if you had not taken yourſelf</hi> WITH <hi>the manner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My readers will hardly doubt, on this repreſentation of the caſe, that the common phraſe was <hi>taken</hi> WITH <hi>the manner.</hi> As to the certainty of its being adopted here, however, it may poſſibly be ſtill diſputed. Dr. Warburton ſays, Biron's queſtion, immediately ſucceeding, ſhews that Coſtard ſhould ſay IN <hi>the manner.</hi> For my part I cannot ſee the force of this reaſon, though I can very well ſee why Biron ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat WITH <hi>the manner,</hi> becauſe of another law phraſe, with which Coſtard anſwers him, viz. IN <hi>manner and form follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Now this could not be, with any propriety, WITH <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and form following.</hi> But I think there is no impropriety in ſuppoſing that Biron, not attending to the quaintneſs of Coſtard's expreſſion, aſks him ſimply and naturally IN <hi>what manner</hi>? notwithſtanding Coſtard had uſed the phraſe WITH <hi>what manner.</hi> Be all this, however, as it may, we have here a very flagrant inſtance, IN <hi>what manner</hi> Dr. Johnſon
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0047702200:94"/>
hath commented on Shakeſpeare, and WITH <hi>what manners</hi> he hath treated the public, who encouraged him in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>

                     <q>To underſtand, ſays our editor, how the princeſs has her glaſs ſo ready at hand in a caſual converſation, it muſt be remembered, that in thoſe days it was the faſhion among the French ladies to wear a looking-glaſs, <hi>as Mr.</hi> BAYLE <hi>coarſely repreſents it,</hi> ON THEIR BELLIES; that is, to have a ſmall mirrour, ſet in gold, hanging at the girdle, by which they occaſionally viewed their faces, or adjuſted their hair.</q>
—As Mr. Johnſon is almoſt always above referring particularly to his authorities, I cannot readily turn to the paſſage in Bayle where he makes this <hi>coarſe repreſentation.</hi> I am greatly apt to ſuſpect, however, from the opinion I have of Monſ. Bayle's uſual propriety and elegance, that our editor hath miſtaken his meaning. It appears to me that, if theſe mirrors were hanging at the girdle, they would have been rather repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as worn at the <hi>ſide,</hi> than <hi>on the belly,</hi> as the watch and <hi>etui</hi> are at preſent. Add to this, that if the ribbon or chain, by which they were hung, was ſo long as to permit the wearer to adjuſt her hair, without taking it quite off (as is reaſonable to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0047702200:96"/>
ſuppoſe) it could hardly be ſuſpended at the girdle; for in that caſe ſuch glaſſes would hang down to the knee, and could not, with any propriety, be ſaid to be worn on the belly. I imagine, therefore, theſe mirrors were ſuſpended from the neck, or ſomehow faſtened to the drapery covering the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and breaſt; in which caſe, Mr. Bayle might ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt inelegance, they were worn <hi>ſur le ventre.</hi> For I will venture to ſay it is, from his uſing the word <hi>ventre</hi> on this occaſion, that Dr. Johnſon charges him with <hi>coarſeneſs</hi>; but <hi>ventre</hi> doth not always ſignify the <hi>belly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The French diſtinguiſh between the ſtomach and belly, by calling the former the <hi>petit-ventre,</hi> or VENTRE SUPERIEUR; and the latter the <hi>bas-ventre.</hi> The general term is alſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed inſtead of POITRINE, and as often means the <hi>ſtomach</hi> and <hi>breaſt,</hi> as it doth the <hi>belly.</hi>—Vaugelas will tell him alſo, that the word <hi>ventre</hi> is uſed with great elegance in metaphorical writing. Thus, <hi>paſſer ſur le ventre à ſon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemi,</hi> is an approved phraſe for <hi>giving an enemy a total defeat.</hi> The French, in like manner, uſe the word <hi>entrailles,</hi> in ſuch phraſes as, literally tranſlated, would be very <hi>coarſe</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting to an Engliſh ear. To inſtance only one or two. <hi>Seigneur, votre loi eſt gravéee dans le fond de mes entrailles.</hi>—<hi>Les entrailles de la miſericorde de Dieu.</hi> One of the moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant French writers, now living, alſo calls the natural affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a parent for his child, <hi>l'amour des entrailles.</hi> But what ſhould we think of an Engliſh critic, who ſhould tranſlate ſuch paſſages thus: <hi>Thy law, O Lord, is engraven in our guts—The entrails of the mercy of God—The affection of the bowels</hi>—and thence take occaſion to cenſure the writer for <hi>coarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and inelegance?</p>
                  <p>We are informed, by ſome letters lately publiſhed <note n="*" place="bottom">In the St. James's Chronicle, and other news-papers; as alſo the monthly magazines.</note>, that when Dr. Johnſon came to town, about the year 1730, he had a deſign of engaging in ſome tranſlation from the French.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0047702200:97"/>
Whether he ever did or no, I cannot ſay; but, from this and ſome other ſpecimens of his acquaintance with that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, I cannot help thinking the author would have been extremely unlucky that had fallen into his hands.</p>

                  <p>What! have you loſt your <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>judgment</hi> too, Mr. Editor, as well as your <hi>memory</hi> and <hi>invention?</hi>—Do you not know that even <hi>ſot</hi> and <hi>ſot</hi> cannot be admitted into any verſe as Engliſh rhymes; and do you think the matter mended with <hi>ſot</hi> and <hi>ſat?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, do you ſee no impropriety in Biron's calling the King, to his face, a blockhood or fool, becauſe truly he was in love; eſpecially when he is conſcious he is himſelf in the ſame ſituation? Add to this, that ſo groſs an expreſſion is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally inconſiſtent with the fine ſtrain of raillery that runs through the whole of his ſpeech. This attempt, therefore, of our editor at <hi>reſtoration,</hi> is evidently a very unlucky one, and is excuſable only as the unſuceſsful endeavour of <hi>modeſt induſtry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why doth Dr. Johnſon conclude this paſſage to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted? If he thinks the rhymes <hi>ſot</hi> and <hi>ſat</hi> admiſſible, ſurely he can have no objection to our pronouncing <hi>ſat</hi> after the broad orthoëpy of the vulgar; in which caſe it would be a much leſs exceptionable rhyme to <hi>knot</hi> than what he is willing

<q>
                        <hi>knot</hi> hath no ſenſe that can ſuit this place.</q>
He might have found, however, by turning to almoſt any dictionary, excepting his own, that a <hi>knot</hi> is a ſmall bird, well known in many parts of England, and is called <hi>avis Canuti</hi> by the naturaliſts; as it is ſaid, becauſe king Canutus was very fond of ſuch birds.

I cannot, for my part, ſee any objection to his comparing him in this paſſage to a wounded <hi>knot.</hi> If my readers do, I have done.

                  </q>
                  <p>Here we have another article of Dr. Johnſon's critical creed. It is certain that, whether <hi>me</hi> be in or out, is, in this place, of very little conſequence; but I ſo much revere the text of Shakeſpeare, that, without I ſee an abſolute neceſſity for it, I will never defile it with a blot. It ſeems as if the very name of <hi>Johnſon</hi> was fated to caſt invidious reflections on that of <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi>; as if it was malignantly formed to abſorb tho rays diffuſed by ſuperior luſtre, and enviouſly to fully, with a reflected gloom, the fountain of its own light.—This ſcheme of blotting-out was originally ſuggeſted by a <hi>Johnſon</hi>; who,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0047702200:101"/>
when the players made their boaſt, in honour of Shakeſpeare, that he never blotted out a line, replied,
<q>Would he had blotted out a thouſand.</q>
This was BEN <hi>Johnſon,</hi> who only expreſſed his wiſh that Shakeſpeare had done, what SAM <hi>Johnſon</hi> boldly determined to do for him. For it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that here was no <hi>tenderneſs due to living reputation</hi> to ſtop his hand; and he might think to indulge himſelf SAFELY in the <hi>innocent diſcuſſion of a dead poet's pretenſions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. Johnſon's Preface.</note>.</p>
                  <p>If it be not owing to ſome ſuch antipathy or inviduous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence ſubſiſting between the names of Johnſon and Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare, to what elſe can we impute Dr. Johnſon's objection to the harmleſs <hi>me</hi> in the above paſſage! He very poſſibly cannot find any uſe for it. But if we conſider that the whole line is a mere exclamation; teſtifying the clown's ſurprize at hearing Autolicus cry out, and ſeeing him lie groveling on the earth. Had he ſaid <hi>In the name of</hi> HEAVEN—or, <hi>In the name of</hi> MERCY—the line, however bordering on profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, would have paſt: but nothing is more common than for conſcientious people to check themſelves in the middle of ſuch exclamations, or to ſubſtitute ſome innocent word in the place of the exceptionable one. Again, if any objection be made to the ſuppoſition of the Clown's ſtopping in the middle of the word <hi>mercy</hi>; let us take another view of the exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and admit the word <hi>me</hi> to ſtand as a perſonal pronoun. It is notorious that perſons, who, as Hotſpur ſays,
<q>ſwear like comfit-maker's wives, and give ſuch ſarcenet ſecurity for their oaths, as, <hi>in good ſooth—as true as I live—as God ſhall mend me</hi>—and <hi>as ſure as I live.</hi>
                     </q>
I ſay it is very common for theſe uncommon ſwearers, who cannot gulp down or digeſt a <hi>good mouth-filling oath,</hi> to proteſt <hi>upon their</hi> WORD. Now I cannot ſee why a perſon, who, to avoid a profane oath, ſhould proteſt <hi>upon his</hi> WORD, might not, with
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0047702200:102"/>
equal propriety, in order to avoid a profane exclamation, cry out <hi>in his</hi> NAME. Admitting this, the Clown, inſtead of crying out in the name of heav'n, exclaimed in the name of himſelf; viz. <hi>l' th'</hi> NAME <hi>of me.</hi>—And this expreſſion may ſurely paſs among expletives of this kind, as well as <hi>for the</hi> SOUL <hi>of me—for the</hi> LIFE <hi>of me—for the</hi> HEART <hi>of me,</hi> &amp;c.—After all, whether I have convinced the reader or not, of the propriety of letting <hi>me</hi> ſtand in the text, I muſt have ſome better reaſon given ME for expunging it, than the <hi>ipſe-credidit</hi> of a JOHNSON.</p>

                     <q>
                        <hi>His work ſo noble, &amp;c.</hi>] It is impoſſible for any man to rid his mind of his profeſſion. The authorſhip of Shakeſpeare has ſupplied him with a metaphor, which, rather than he would loſe it, he has put, with no great propriety, into the mouth of a country maid. Thinking of his own works, his mind paſſed naturally to the binder. I am glad he has no hint at an editor.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have here alſo, another aukward attempt of our editor at wit and pleaſantry. But, why wilt thou, Dr. Johnſon, perſiſt thus in playing at bob-cherry, when the prize hangeth ſo high above thine head, and ſuch a weight of lead is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on thy heels? I have already adviſed thee, in the fullneſs of my heart, and, as Cicero ſays, non otii abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantiâ, ſed amoris erga te, not to be ſo forward to diſplay thy wit. I told thee before, and I tell thee again, thou haſt it not in thee, being as unable to divert the reader with thy pleaſantry, as to convince him of Shakeſpeare's impropriety.—Again, why, Dr. Johnſon, art thou glad that Shakeſpeare
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0047702200:103"/>
hath no hint at an editor? Doſt thou think he would have thrown out any cenſures that might reach <hi>thee?</hi>—No—that incomparable bard was, as thou ſayeſt, the poet of nature, and drew his characters from, the life: and nature had not produced in that age ſo arrogant, and at the ſame time ſo dull an animal, as the preſent commentator on Shakeſpeare. There were pedants and pedagogues, it is true, in his day; he has depicted an Holofernes and a Sir Hugh Evans. But theſe were ſlight excreſcences, muſhrooms, champignons, that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed as the ſmoke of the dunghil evaporated, which reared them. A modern editor of Shakeſpeare is, on the contrary, a fungus attached to an oak; a male agaric of the moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tringent kind, that, while it disfigures its form, may laſt for ages to diſgrace the parent of its being.</p>
                  <p>But, to lay aſide metaphor; not Burgerdiſchius, Gronovius, nor any one of the whole tribe of Dutch commentators, from the firſt of them to the laſt, hath proceeded through his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor with more phlegm and frigidity, than Dr. Johnſon hath gone through Shakeſpeare <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>And here lies the difference between Dr. Warburton and Dr. Johnſon, whoſe commentaries I place both on a footing with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their utility, as they are themſelves pretty equal with reſpect to that arrogance with which they have treated the public, the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing patrons of Shakeſpeare. In the commentary of Dr. Warburton, however, we have all the fire and ſpirit of a reſtif imagination, bridled in by as perverſe an underſtanding: whereas, in that of Dr. Johnſon, we ſee but too plainly the waywardneſs of ſeneſcence ſtruggling with the weakneſs of puerility.</p>
                        <p>It may be thought ſtrange that I ſhould treat Dr. Johnſon's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to wit ſo contemptuouſly, when it is notorious that his bons-mots have been conſtantly repeated for theſe ten years paſt in taverns and in coffeehouſes, at dinners, and over tea-tables, to the great gratification of his admirers, and the edification of their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Nay, it is well known, that a certain literary projector, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the ſucceſs of BEN <hi>Johnſon's</hi> jeſts, had ſchemed the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Johnſoniana,</hi> under the name of our editor, intending to inſert on his title page, inſtead of <hi>O rare</hi> BEN! <hi>O brave</hi> SAM!—But I know not how, yet ſo it happened, that, upon enquiry, the projector could not muſter up above a dozen <hi>genuine</hi> jokes worth printing. It was found that moſt of the wiſe ſayings, ſmart repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0047702200:104"/>pregnant puns, and cramp conundrums, imputed to him, had been forged or invented for him by his friends and acquaintance. The few following indeed were, if I remember right, admitted to be genuine:</p>
                        <p>JOHNSONIANA, <hi>or the witty ſayings of Sam. Johnſon, M. A.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Johnſon, being ſent for, by order of the king, to write the Hiſtory of the Houſe of Brunſwick; replied, with great humour and loyalty, to the gentleman who propoſed it, by ſaying, <hi>What! Sir, is there no ſcoundrel author in England but myſelf?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Johnſon, being offered a penſion by his preſent majeſty, in return for the above inſtance of his loyalty, he, notwithſtanding his former railing at placemen and penſioners, very wittily and wiſely ſaid—<hi>nothing</hi>; but growled and TOOK IT.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Johnſon having, on a neceſſary occaſion, turned himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the wall, in one of the ſtreets of Oxford, was reminded by his companion, that he had indecently placed himſelf juſt oppoſite a window where ſome young ladies were drinking tea: on which Mr. Johnſon, p—f—g on, wittily and delicately replied, <hi>Sir, it is the</hi> OFFICE <hi>of Nature, and I ſhall</hi> DISCHARGE <hi>it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At another time, Mr. Johnſon, being in company where ſome perſons were diſputing about the doctrine of the Trinity, he roſe up from his chair, and <hi>ingeniouſly</hi> decided the diſpute at once, by clenching his fiſt, and threatening to <hi>knock the firſt perſon down, who, in his preſence, ſhould caſt infidel reflections on his friend Athanaſius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the ſame company, he was alſo heard moſt divertingly to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that <hi>The man muſt be an</hi> ATHEIST <hi>of the deepeſt dye, who did not believe in the</hi> COCK-LANE GHOST.</p>
                        <p>At various times and places, he hath been heard alſo to drop the following exquiſite ſtrokes of wit and humour.—<hi>Sir, Sir, the fellow is a fool.—Sir, the man is a blockhead.—The raſcal is an Atheiſt.—There are but three good lines in all</hi> CHURCHILL's <hi>ſatires, and two of them he ſtole from my</hi> LONDON.—<hi>Shakeſpeare a poet! Sir, he never wrote a line of poetry in his life. An oſtler! Sir, a</hi> VARLET, <hi>that uſed to hold gentlemen's horſes at the play-houſe!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe, and a few other ſtrokes, equally pointed and humorous, being all the undertaker of the above project could pick up; and as the humour even of theſe depended greatly on a certain motion of the head peculiar to Dr. Johnſon, which cannot be committed to paper, it was judged adviſeable to drop the ſcheme: ſo that I hope I ſtand excuſed, if I do not place Dr. Johnſon's witticiſms among the <hi>anas,</hi> or think him upon a ſooting even with Joe Miller, or his own name-ſake Ben.</p>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0047702200:103"/>
                     </note>. It is hard to ſay, indeed, who
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0047702200:104"/>
is the dulleſt ſcholiaſt of the dulleſt writer of antiquity. But Dr. Johnſon has the ſingular honour of being the dulleſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notator
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0047702200:105"/>
on the brighteſt of all thoſe who have ſucceeded the revival of letters.</p>
                  <p>To return to Dr. Johnſon's annotation, and the more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular defence of Shakeſpeare's text.</p>
                  <p>The editor hath here charged the poet with being guilty of an impropriety in making a country maid talk like an author. But how doth Dr. Johnſon know that this is really the caſe? How doth it appear, from the words of the text, that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion he charges on Shakeſpeare is at all intended?—That Perdita could know nothing about book-binding, is taken for granted; this being the very circumſtance, on which the charge of impropriety is founded. But it does not appear, notwithſtanding Dr. Johnſon imputes this impropriety to Shakeſpeare's profeſſion, that the poet himſelf was much verſed in the matter. It is very little likely that a writer, who confeſſedly took ſo little care about the <hi>printing</hi> of his works, and has <hi>no hint at an editor,</hi> ſhould yet have his head ſo full of a <hi>book-binder.</hi> Dr. Johnſon is pleaſed, for the honour I ſuppoſe of our profeſſion, to rank Shakeſpeare among the livery-men of our company. But, though I honour my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as being the moſt liberal of all others, though I honour the immortal memory of Shakeſpeare ſtill more, yet I reſpect the <hi>truth</hi> moſt of all. It does not appear that the term <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorſhip</hi> can be applied with any propriety to Shakeſpeare; for, though he wrote for the ſtage, I find no good authority for ſuppoſing he ſold his copies, or transferred his right in them, to bookſellers; and he only is an author by <hi>profeſſion</hi> who writes for the TRADE.—No—To the honour of the gentlemen of the ſtage, Shakeſpeare was by <hi>profeſſion</hi> a PLAYER; and I have no better reaſon, than his knowing every thing, to ſuppoſe he knew that a book-binder exiſted.</p>
                  <p>To come now to <hi>verbal</hi> criticiſm. A piece of <hi>work vilely bound up,</hi> muſt, according to Dr. Johnſon, neceſſarily mean a <hi>book meanly bound.</hi> But why ſo? Neither the words <hi>work</hi> nor <hi>bound up</hi> are idiomatical, when applied to book-binding.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0047702200:106"/>
In the firſt place, we do not call the writings of an author his <hi>work,</hi> but his <hi>works.</hi> And, though ſometimes, in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſeveral ſheets of a book, or the different volumes of an author's works, we may talk of <hi>binding</hi> them <hi>up</hi>; yet, ſpeaking of a <hi>book</hi> in the ſingular number, we talk always of its being <hi>bound</hi> merely; not of its being <hi>bound up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other hand, the term <hi>bind up</hi> is applicable to various works of huſbandry, and ſuch kinds of employment as a country maid might well be ſuppoſed acquainted with. Add to this, that the term <hi>bound up</hi> has a peculiar propriety in the paſſage before us, as it is oppoſed to <hi>prank'd up,</hi> a few lines above. The reader will remember, that Perdita, the country maid, is dreſſed like a princeſs; or, as ſhe ſays, <hi>moſt goddeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prank'd up</hi>; and Florizel, the real prince, is diſguiſed in the habit of a clown. Now it is obſervable that, as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perb dreſſes of the rich and gay were faſtened together by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental brooches, ouches, knots of ribbons, &amp;c. ſo the coarſer garments of the poor and ſimple were faſtened toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and tied with ſtrings or leathern thongs. And hence Perdita might very properly ſay, that the prince, in his <hi>ſwain's wearing,</hi> was vilely <hi>bound up</hi>; without having any more allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the <hi>binding</hi> of a book than to the <hi>binding up</hi> of a wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheaf. But, becauſe ſhe has called the ſon the father's <hi>work,</hi> without any impropriety in the line before, ſhe muſt in this truly allude to <hi>book-binding:</hi> though, were it ſo, ſhe muſt be guilty of as great an impropriety in the application of her alluſion. For why an author ſhould be ſo terribly angry, as ſhe ſuppoſes, at accidentally ſeeing his works meanly bound, I cannot poſſibly deviſe; as I conceive neither his intereſt nor his reputation can be at all affected by the difference between calve's ſkin and ſheep's leather.</p>

                     <q>* What he means by his <hi>pedler's excrement</hi> I know not?</q> No!—Then, give me leave to tell you, Dr. Johnſon, you know too little, or are much too indolent and inattentive to undertake a commentary on Shakeſpeare.—Doth not <hi>Armado,</hi> in <hi>Love's Labour Loſt,</hi> page 185, of this very volume, call his <hi>beard</hi> an <hi>excrement?</hi> and do not you tell us in a note on that paſſage, that 'the author has before called the <hi>beard</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leur's <hi>excrement</hi> in the Merchant of Venice?' And ſhould not the recollection of theſe paſſages (not to mention others which an able commentator might have recollected) have excited you to turn over this play a little, in order to ſee whether ſome reaſon might not be found for ſuppoſing the word <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement</hi> to have here the ſame meaning?—You may think, indeed, the futility of ſuch a reſearch evident on the face of the text; as a man cannot eaſily put his <hi>beard</hi> in his <hi>pocket.</hi>—Very true; but he does not call it his <hi>own</hi> beard, but his <hi>pedler's</hi> beard, for that character was aſſumed, as was alſo the falſe beard he wore on that occaſion, in order the more to diſguiſe himſelf, leſt he ſhould be known again by the clown he had juſt before robbed, act IV. ſcene 3. It would have required no very acute or profound obſervation alſo, to have remarked that, though Florizel, in ſcene 10. ſtripped him of his pedler's clothes, he had either no occaſion for his beard, or did not think it a falſe one: this, therefore, Autolycus had ſtill on, notwithſtanding his change of habit, till he found it neceſſary to ſpeak to the clowns; when, prudently to appear in character, he whip'd it off, and clap'd it in his pocket; ſaying, <hi>Let me pocket up my pedler's excrement.</hi>—Do you know <hi>now,</hi> Dr. Johnſon? Or, will you prudentially chuſe to remain
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0047702200:108"/>
ſtill in ignorance; ſhake your wiſe head; and ſay, as uſual, '<hi>Sir, Sir, the man who tells me this, is a blackhead</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Having written the above remarks on the pedler's excrement, without turning to the editor's increment, the appendix to his eighth volume; I was inclined to throw them aſide, on finding that the editor had found out, or that ſomebody had told him, the meaning of the word; for he there ſays, very laconically too, page 323.
<q>Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's excrement is pedler's beard.</q>
But, as he has not any where thought proper to let the reader into the ſecret of its being a fictitious beard, or how otherwiſe Autolicus could put it in his pocket, I conceived ſome of my readers might profit by the above illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore determined to inſert it: and this the rather, when I reflected that Dr. Johnſon could by no means lay a juſt claim to the merit of ſuch information as he might acquire, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly advertiſing for, after his book was finiſhed.</note>!'</p>

                        <hi>It's dry, Sir.</hi>] What is the jeſt of a <hi>dry hand,</hi> I know not any better than Sir Andrew. It may poſſibly mean a hand with no money in it; or, according to the rules of <hi>phyſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi> ſhe may intend to inſinuate, that it is not a lover's hand, a moiſt hand being vulgarly accounted a ſign of an amorous conſtitution.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>It muſt be confeſſed, indeed, that our editor's ſagacity is frequently at fault when a jeſt is in the wind. The bringing <hi>the hand to the buttery-bar, and letting it drink,</hi> is a proverbial phraſe among forward Abigails, to aſk at once for a kiſs and a preſent. Sir Andrew's ſlowneſs of comprehenſion in this particular, gave her a juſt ſuſpicion, at once, of his frigidity and avarice.—She therefore calls his hand dry: the moiſtneſs of the hand being a ſign of liberality, as well in matters of love as money. Thus Othello to Deſdemona,
<q>
                        <l>Give me your hand. This hand is moiſt, my lady.</l>

Old Foreſight, in Love for Love, deſcribes his wife alſo as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mole upon her lip, with a <hi>moiſt palm,</hi> and an open li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality on the mount of Venus.—Dr. Johnſon need not, therefore, have expreſſed ſo much caution of ſuſpecting this to be the truth of the matter. There is one thing, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he ſhould have attended to; and this is, that the whole of this inſinuation is founded rather on the rules of <hi>palmiſtry</hi> than <hi>phyſiognomy:</hi> for, though the etymology of the latter word be known to the learned, who may admit of ſuch lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of expreſſion, I do not remember ever to have ſeen <hi>phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy</hi> made uſe of before by an Engliſh writer to ſignify any information of this kind, but that which is acquired from the features of the face. So that Marian's finding out any thing from St. Andrew's <hi>palm,</hi> by the rules of <hi>phyſiognomy,</hi> muſt appear to an unlearned reader, as abſurd as if ſhe had read his folly in his <hi>phyz</hi> by the rules of <hi>palmiſtry.</hi>

                  <p>To check the ſmile, however, of the unlearned reader, and to preſerve the <hi>veneration</hi> due to cramp words and crooked letters, he is to know that <hi>phyz</hi> doth not come from <gap reason="foreign">

I have ever looked upon it, however, as ſo vile a blot in this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable piece of raillery of Sir Toby's, that I cannot help imputing it to the interpolation of ſome tranſcriber, who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined there was an excellent joke in <hi>making water into a</hi> SINK-A-PACE. The conceit, however, is ſo low and vile, that I cannot give into the notion that Shakeſpeare, fond as he ſeems of punning and playing upon words, was the author of it. I am confirmed in this opinion alſo by reflecting, that the attention of the reader is diverted from the real humour of the paſſage, by this horrid conundrum. Sir Toby, in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his ridicule of poor Ague-cheek's dancing-accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the higheſt pitch, proceeds ſo far as to tell him, he would not ſtand ſtill on the moſt neceſſary occaſion, even to make water; but that he might not betray himſelf, even to this fool, by talking of abſolute impoſſibilities, he fixes on a grave, flow, and even hobbling kind of dance, the <hi>cinque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace,</hi> for this ſuſpicious occaſion <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>The gravity and interruptions of this dance are, indeed, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly pointed out by Shakeſpeare on another occaſion.
<q>Woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wedding, and repenting, is a Scotch jigg, a meaſure, and a cinque-pace. The firſt ſuit is hot and haſty like a Scotch jigg, and full as fantaſtical; the wedding mannerly and modeſt, as a meaſure full of ſtate and gravity; and then comes repentance, and, with his bad legs, falls into the cinque-pace.</q>

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>What the preſent editor underſtands by this word, or whether he underſtands any thing by it, is not eaſily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, as he hath thought proper to leave it in this ſituation, doubtleſs for the reaſon given above; viz. its being natural for the reader to delight more in what he may find out of himſelf, than what the ſcholiaſt may tell him. For my part, however, I apprehend the mere Engliſh reader would be glad of ſome little aſſiſtance here, eſpecially as Dr. Johnſon does not ſeem to be ſatisfied with Dr. Warburton's note.—The author of the Reviſal appears alſo to be of the ſame opinion,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0047702200:115"/>
and therefore hath given his readers the following remarks on this controverted paſſage.
<q>
                        <hi>Will you go on, Heris?</hi> The nonſenſe of the former editions was, 'Will you go <hi>an heirs?</hi>' Mr. Warburton aſſures us, '<hi>heris</hi> is an old Scotch word for maſter.' It may be ſo for ought I know. But as my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath taught me ſome diſtruſt of this gentleman's poſitive aſſertions in matters of this nature, I muſt beg leave to doubt of it. Beſides, this word, according to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpetation of it, is of the ſingular number, and yet is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, not to Ford, but to Page and Shallow, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what immediately follows. I ſee no reaſon neither why either Shakeſpeare, or mine hoſt of the Garter, ſhould chuſe to talk old Scotch, and therefore I ſhould rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our poet might have written, 'Will you go on, <hi>hearts?</hi>' An expreſſion ſuited to the jovial character of mine hoſt, and not very different in appearance from the common reading, eſpecially when ſpelled as it anciently was, <hi>herts.</hi> Mr. Theobald's conjectures, 'Will you go on <hi>here?</hi>' or Will you go, <hi>mynheirs?</hi>' carry with them, in my opinion, very little probability.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is very juſtly obſerved by the Reviſer, that there is no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious reaſon for mine hoſt of the Garter to ſpeak old Scotch; but if we conſider that he is a German, I do not ſee why the ſcholiaſt ſhould ſuppoſe Theobald's laſt emendation impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. Nothing is more likely, I think, than for him now and then to drop a word of high or low Dutch. It is true that the word <hi>mynheirs</hi> is properly neither one nor the other: for neither the Dutch nor the German make the plural of <hi>heer</hi> or <hi>herr</hi> end in <hi>s.</hi> Add to this, that they ſeldom uſe the perſonal pronoun ſingular with the noun plural. When they accoſt a ſingle perſon with the title of <hi>my Lord</hi> or <hi>Sir,</hi> it is <hi>Mynheer</hi> or <hi>Mein herr</hi>; but when they addreſs more than one with the title of <hi>Lords</hi> or <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the pronoun is generally dropped, and they ſay <hi>Heeren</hi> or <hi>Herren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I ſee no manner of impropriety in ſuppoſing our hoſt to be either above or below ſuch idiomatical and grammatical
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0047702200:116"/>
niceties: in which caſe he might not only join the ſingular pronoun with the plural noun (as the Engliſh ſay my Lords, as well as my Lord) but alſo give the plural noun their common ending in Engliſh; ſo that if Theobald had ſubſtituted <hi>myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heers,</hi> it might have paſted. But if it be inſiſted on, that our hoſt of the Garter ſhall ſpeak properly and elegantly, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage muſt ſtand thus. "Will you go on, <hi>heeren,</hi> or <hi>herren.</hi>" The reader may take which he likes beſt, both meaning ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>Will you go on, gentlemen?</hi>—</p>
                  <p>I cannot help referring, on this occaſion, to a paſſage in our editor's preface; where, among other excuſes for doing ſo little, after having promiſed ſo much, he hath the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing curious paſſage:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If my readings are of little value, they have not been oſtentatiouſly diſplayed, or importunately obtruded. I could have written longer notes; for the art of writing notes is not of difficult attainment. The work is performed, firſt by railing at the ſtupidity, negligence, ignorance, and aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine taſteleſſneſs of the former editors, and ſhewing, from all that goes before, and all that follows, the inelegance and abſurdity of the old reading; then by propoſing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which, to ſuperficial readers, would ſeem ſpecious, but which the editor rejects with indignation; then by <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the true reading,</hi> with a long paraphraſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding with <hi>loud</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>Dr. Johnſon is here expreſly deſcribing the method of <hi>writing</hi> annotations. Pray, Doctor, is your <hi>pen</hi> any thing like a <hi>ſpeaking trumpet,</hi> a <hi>ſtentorophontick inſtrument,</hi> as your dictionary more expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly calls it? If it be not, I cannot, for the ſoul of me conceive how you do to <hi>write</hi> LOUD. As to <hi>my</hi> gooſe-quill, it runs over the paper as ſtill as a mouſe; but then, it is true, I cannot boaſt that my writings have <hi>made ſo much noiſe</hi> in the world as thoſe of Dr. Johnſon.</p>

                  </p>

<q>No, ſurely; <hi>Page</hi> ſtood tightly to the opinion of her honeſty, and would not entertain a thought of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>frail.</hi> I have therefore ventured to ſubſtitute a word correſpondent to the ſenſe required, and one which our poet frequently uſes to ſignify conjugal fidelity.</q>
—In reply to this note, Dr. Warburton ſays,
<q>Mr. Theobald has no conception how any man could ſtand firmly on his wife's <hi>frailty.</hi> And why? Becauſe he had no conception how he could ſtand upon it, without knowing what it was. But if I tell a ſtranger that the bridge he is about to croſs is rotten, and he believes it not, but will go on, may I not ſay, when I ſee him upon it, that he ſtands firmly on a rotten plank? yet he has changed <hi>frailty</hi> for <hi>fealty,</hi> and the Oxford editor has followed him. But they took the phraſe, <hi>to ſtand firmly on,</hi> to ſignify <hi>to inſiſt</hi> upon; whereas it ſignifies to <hi>reſt upon</hi>; which the character of a <hi>ſecure fool,</hi> given to him, ſhews. So that the common reading has an elegance that would be loſt in the alteration.</q>

                  <p>Notwithſtanding this fine reaſoning, however, of Dr. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burton, the preſent editor hath judiciouſly ſtuck by Theobald's emendation in the text, though he is perfectly ſilent about it in his notes.

                  <p>In a note on this paſſage, our editor hath diſplayed his critical acumen moſt egregiouſly; as indeed moſt of Shakeſpeare's editors do, when they venture an inch beyond the ſervile bounds of <hi>verbal</hi> criticiſm. Our poet is univerſally allowed to be one of the greateſt maſters in deſcribing the effects, as well as the greateſt judge of the operation, of the paſſions, that ever exiſted. And yet is he here arraigned for an error, which affects him as an accurate obſerver of human nature, and a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0047702200:119"/>
juſt delineator of the actions of mankind, his moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing characteriſtics. The note here follows:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Eleven o'clock.</hi>] Ford ſhould rather have ſaid <hi>ten o'clock</hi>; the time was between ten and eleven; and his impatient ſuſpicion was not likely to ſtay beyond the time.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>No; Dr. Johnſon.—<hi>Ford</hi> ſhould neither be made to ſay <hi>ten</hi> nor <hi>eleven</hi> o'clock: he is not ſpeaking of the time, at which Falſtaff is to meet his wife; but of the time then preſent, which is <hi>ſeven</hi> o'clock, juſt <hi>three hours,</hi> as he expreſly obſerves, from the earlieſt time of the appointment. So that, ſo far is his impatient ſuſpicion from ſtaying beyond the time of their intended meeting, that it ſeems to urge him inſtantly to go about to defeat the ſuppoſed purpoſes of it.—<hi>I will about it—better</hi> THREE HOURS <hi>too ſoon than a minute too late.</hi>—Why ſhould he particularly mention <hi>three</hi> hours rather than any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite time, unleſs for the reaſon given? I know not how far the copies may authorize this reading; but the miſtake might eaſily be made by the firſt tranſcribers, and be ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively tranſmitted through the preſs uncorrected, as the ſenſe was not very palpably affected by it. By reading <hi>ſeven</hi> for <hi>eleven,</hi> however, we deliver Shakeſpeare from the perſecution of his annotator, and give a beauty and propriety to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which at preſent is doubtleſs exceptionable. I would adviſe the actor alſo, who may perform this part for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to look at his watch, when he repeats this ſentence; for that was evidently the author's intention, as appears by the intimation of his having ſtill <hi>three hours good,</hi> in which to take proper meaſures to ſurpriſe the parties. He did not mean, as is plain by the ſequel, to prevent or hinder their meeting, but to be before-hand <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>The word <hi>prevent</hi> being here uſed, perhaps nearly, though not altogether in the ſame ſenſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ford's ſimply getting the ſtart of the parties, in order to detect and expoſe them; or, as is above hinted, to prevent or hinder his being made a cuckold. But I think he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0047702200:120"/>ſeems to ſo be well aſſured of his having been cuckolded by ſomebody or other, that a ſingle prevention of this kind could be of little conſideration with him. It were indeed to little purpoſe, if his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his wife were juſtly founded, and his ſarcaſm on the ſex in general were true; i. e. that
<q>what they think in their hearts they <hi>may</hi> effect, they will break their hearts but they <hi>will</hi> effect.</q>

Add to all this, that although, in his rage, he ſays, juſt before, <hi>the hour is fixt,</hi> yet no one <hi>particular hour</hi> was preciſely named for the intended rendezvous; it was not at ten, nor at eleven, but between ten and eleven; ſo that the reaſon Dr. Johnſon gives, why he ſhould not ſay <hi>eleven,</hi> is in itſelf ſufficient to prove he ſhould ſay neither.</p>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0047702200:121"/>
appears by the application, however, that Shakeſpeare knew the meaning of this line; and, if he knew it in Lilly, why might he not know it in the original author from whom it was taken? Is it becauſe you have ſo often quoted words and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, in languages <hi>you</hi> do not underſtand, that you ſuſpect Shakeſpeare of a ſimilar practice? You ſhould never meaſure others' corn by your own buſhel. You have been already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in public, for miſrepreſenting in your preface the teſtimony of your predeceſſor Ben Johnſon; who tells us, that Shakeſpeare had <hi>ſmall</hi> LATIN <hi>and leſs</hi> GREEK. This you converted into <hi>ſmall Latin and</hi> NO <hi>Greek.</hi> The ingenious critic, who reminded you of this error, was <hi>candid</hi> enough to impute it to your quoting from memory only <note n="*" place="bottom">In the St. James's Chronicle.</note>; but, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that, in this caſe, ſuch a method of quotation was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, it appears, I think, too plainly, from your conſtant and repeated endeavours to depreciate both the natural and acquired abilities of Shakeſpeare, that this was not the caſe. Your perſeverance in theſe endeavours, at leaſt, give great reaſon to ſuſpect the miſtake was wilful; as the ſuppoſition of his having any Greek at all, would not have ſuited with your darling project, or anſwered your end, of invidiouſly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him as a <hi>varlet,</hi> one of the illiterate vulgar.</p>

—Good lack! what a ſad thing it is to want Dr. Johnſon's <hi>underſtanding!</hi> You underſtand it, no doubt, Doctor!—Oh, yes, I ſee you tell us what it is.—

                  <p>But, among friends, now, Doctor, how do you know this? I know that, in your dictionary, by way of proving that to be <hi>in books,</hi> (as you vaguely term it) means to be held <hi>in kind remembrance,</hi> you quote the following paſſage from Addiſon.
<q>I was ſo much <hi>in his books,</hi> that, at his deceaſe, he left me the lamp, by which he uſed to write his lucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations.</q>
—But do you, merely becauſe the phraſe is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by this paſſage, inſiſt upon the phraſe being literally applicable to the illuſtration. Or, have you a better reaſon? 'faith, I am apt to ſuſpect not; for ſurely, uncommunicative as you are, you would have told it us either in your dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or in your edition of Shakeſpeare.—Shall I tell you, then, what I conceive to be the origin of this phraſe? not that I pertinaciouſly inſiſt upon being in the right, becauſe I think Dr. Johnſon is in the wrong. I have a mind to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge myſelf, however, in a <hi>conjecture,</hi> if it <hi>ſo prove,</hi> on this occaſion.</p>
                  <p>It was an ancient cuſtom among the literati all over Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and is ſtill kept up abroad, particularly in Holland and Germany, for men of letters to keep a book, which they call an <hi>album,</hi> ſo denominated from a ſimilar application of that word, among the ancient Romans, to a matricular regiſter or muſter-roll of names. This book, or books, contained in like manner a liſt of the names of the owner's friends, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers or acquaintance; who, in ſubſcribing their names in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0047702200:124"/>
his <hi>album,</hi> generally uſed to preface them with ſome compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or device, in proſe or verſe, each after his own man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It was very natural, therefore, for them to ſay, in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their favourites or friends, that they were in their books; and of their enemies, that they were not in their books, or out of their books. Nay, I know not if it would be at all unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for reſentful perſons to ſtrike out the names of thoſe who might afterwards offend them, in order to ſhew their ſpleen, and at the ſame time that they would not be obliged to ſuch people for a compliment. I cannot help thinking alſo, that I diſcover a propriety in the meſſenger's uſing this phraſe to Beatrice, as he might intend ſarcaſtically to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate that, he imagined, by the ſeverity of her raillery againſt Benedict, that he was one who had paid no compliment to her beauty. But whether this propriety be imaginary or not, there is not the leaſt room for ſuppoſing that he meant to ſay Beatrice had not, according to Dr. Johnſon's explication, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered Benedict in the codicil of her will. It is, indeed, a thouſand to one if the laſt will and teſtament of the buxom Beatrice was written; and a much greater chance if it had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicils annexed to it.</p>

                  <p>Dr. Johnſon's note.
<q>What is it <hi>to go to the world?</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to enter, by marriage, into a ſettled ſtate: but why is the unmarried lady <hi>ſun-burnt?</hi> I believe we ſhould read, <hi>thus goes every one to the</hi> wood <hi>but I, and I am ſun-burnt.</hi> Thus does every one but I find a ſhelter, and I am left ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to wind and <hi>ſun. The neareſt way to the wood,</hi> is a phraſe for the readieſt means to any end. It is ſaid of a a woman, who accepts a worſe match than thoſe which ſhe had refuſed, that ſhe has paſſed through the <hi>wood,</hi> and at laſt taken a crooked ſtick. But conjectural criticiſm has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0047702200:125"/>
ſomething to abate its confidence. Shakeſpeare, in All's well that ends well, uſes the phraſe, <hi>to go to the world,</hi> for <hi>marriage.</hi> So that my emendation depends only on the oppoſition of <hi>wood</hi> to <hi>ſun-burnt.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A very ſlight dependance, indeed, and by no means worthy ſo prolix an illuſtration! Our editor, ſurely, had loſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a wood, or his wits were gone wool-gathering about the hedges while he penned it.—<hi>To go to the world,</hi> is to <hi>go into,</hi> to <hi>ſettle in, the world,</hi> which is uſually ſuppoſed to be done in marriage. Thus the clown, in All's well that ends well, aſks the Counteſs leave to marry Iſabel.—<hi>If I have your ladyſhip's good will to go to the</hi> world, <hi>Iſabel the woman and I will do as we may.</hi>—That a <hi>wood</hi> was neceſſary to give meaning to the word <hi>ſun-burnt,</hi> I cannot admit. It is evident that Beatrice here ſpeaks ironically, and, perhaps, a little ſarcaſtically and peeriſhly, on the occaſion of Hero's getting a huſband before her. For it ſeems that Hero was a brunette, and, in all probability, not ſo fair nor ſo fine a woman as Beatrice. At leaſt ſo it is, if we may take Signior Benedict's word for it, who, ſpeaking of Hero, ſays,
<q>She is too low for an high praiſe, too <hi>brown</hi> for a <hi>fair</hi> praiſe, and too little for a great praiſe:</q>
whereas of her couſin Beatrice he ſpeaks in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner, and this even before he is tricked into falling in love with her, and while he boaſts that
<q>he can ſee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpectacles.</q>
Of her he ſays, after turning up his noſe, as it were, at the commendations given to the perſon of Hero,
<q>There's her couſin, if ſhe were not poſſeſſed with ſuch a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the firſt of May doth the laſt of December.</q>
Now, though we ſhould ſuppoſe Benedict to be a little partial, as having a ſneaking kindneſs, though he will not own it, for this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fury; yet it ſeems clear that ſhe was fairer than Hero. It was very natural for her, therefore, to ſay ironically on this occaſion,
<q>Thus every one gets married but I.—Poor I am <hi>ſunburn'd</hi>; i. e. not fair enough to attract the notice of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0047702200:126"/>
the men, but muſt ſit in a corner and cry <hi>heigh-ho</hi> for a huſband.</q>

                           <l>Is good; <hi>and, with</hi> a name, vileneſs is ſo.</l>
                        </q>
                        <hi>i. e.</hi> good is good, though there be no addition of title; and vileneſs is vileneſs, though there be. The Oxford editor, underſtanding nothing of this, ſtrikes out vileneſs, and puts in its place <hi>in'tſelf.</hi>

                  <p>Dr. Johnſon ſays,
<q>The preſent reading is certainly wrong; and, to confeſs the truth, I do not think Dr. Warburton's emendation right; yet I have nothing that I can propoſe with much confidence. Of all the conjectures that I can make, that which leaſt diſpleaſes me is this:
<q>
                           <l>—virtue alone,</l>
                           <l>Is good without a name; <hi>Helen</hi> is ſo;</l>
                        </q>
the reſt follows eaſily by this change.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The author of the Reviſal ſeems to underſtand the paſſage better than either of the doctorial critics juſt mentioned. He tells us the common reading is,
<q>
                        <l>—good alone</l>
                        <l>Is good <hi>without</hi> a name; vileneſs is ſo:</l>
                     </q>
                     <q>the meaning of which, ſays he, one would imagine ſhould be pretty plain. Good ſingly by itſelf, without the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of title, is good ſtill; it is the ſame thing with vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It takes its nature from itſelf, and not from exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal circumſtances, as title and the like. And this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0047702200:129"/>
is given by the poet himſelf, in the lines imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately following,
<q>
                           <l>The property by what it is ſhould go,</l>
                           <l>Not by the title.</l>
                        </q>
Notwithſtanding all this, Mr. Warburton miſtook the meaning, and then murdered the text.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to Dr. Johnſon's conjectural emendation, it ſerves to no other purpoſe than to betray how barren he is at conjectures. I conceive, nevertheleſs, that our editor hath reſtored the true pointing, though it differs from that of his rival ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſt. But whether this be due to cunning or good luck, I cannot pretend to ſay, unleſs I knew to whom to attribute the honour of correcting the preſs, the editor or the printer. The meaning I think is obvious, and the paſſage may be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſed thus: <hi>good</hi> by itſelf <hi>is good, and even ſo, if unadorned by titles, vileneſs were vileneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not propoſe this improvement of the Reviſer's expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with any great confidence, nor merely for the ſake of differing from that very ſenſible writer; but becauſe I think there is ſome little tautology in ſaying <hi>good by itſelf</hi> is good, and then to add <hi>without</hi> a name; for certainly if it was <hi>by it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> alone, it was <hi>without</hi> any thing elſe.</p>

                  <p>The commentators ſeem to be ſadly puzzled to explain this letter; the meaning of which could not poſſibly be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by any one who ſhould read the play quite through. Dr. Warburton's note runs thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>When thou canſt get the ring upon my finger.</hi>] i. e. When thou canſt get the ring, which is on my finger, into thy poſſeſſion. The Oxford editor, who took it the other way, to ſignify, when thou canſt get it on upon my finger, very ſagaciouſly alters it to, <hi>When thou canſt get the ring</hi> from <hi>my finger.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dr. Warburton's explanation is undoubtedly as well founded as the Oxford editor's is ſtrange and inconſiſtent. Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, indeed, ſays, that he thinks
<q>Dr. Warburton's explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſufficient; but, continues he, I once read it thus, <hi>When thou canſt get the ring upon</hi> THY <hi>finger, which never ſhall come</hi> off MINE.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Will the reader believe me, when I tell him, after this, that the meaning of the paſſage in diſpute is not only aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0047702200:131"/>
by the plot of the play, as above hinted; but is alſo expreſſed in the laſt act by words that admit of no equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Yet ſo it is; Helena, in the laſt ſcene, producing the letter, and addreſſing Bertram in theſe words,
<q>
                        <l>—there is your ring,</l>
                        <l>And look you, here's your letter: this it ſays,</l>
                        <l>When from my finger you can get this ring,</l>
                        <l>And are by me with child, &amp;c. <hi>This is done.</hi>
                        </l>

                  </p>
                  <p>If ſcholiaſts would but make themſelves maſters of the text, before they ſit down to write comments on it, they would be ſaved a world of trouble in puzzle and conjecture. It is true, they would not have ſuch frequent opportunities of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing their ingenuity; but then they would frequently avoid falling into abſurdity; ſo that, as our editor obſerves on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion, they would gain on one ſide what they loſe on the other; for, as Merry Andrew critically remarks of his dancing pigs, what they now get by footing and caſting off, they loſe by ſetting corners and turning round.</p>

                  <p>Dr. Warburton, to whom Dr. Johnſon ſticks, like one of the conjuror's familiars, to the ſkirts of Trappolin, ſays,
<q>the words are here oddly ſhuffled into nonſenſe. We ſhould read,</q>
ſays he,
<q>
                        <l>—pierce the ſtill-moving air,</l>
                        <l>That ſings with piercing,—</l>
                     </q>
                     <q>i. e. pierce the air, which is in perpetual motion, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers no injury by piercing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0047702200:132"/>To this Dr. Johnſon adds nothing on the page before us; but tells us, in his appendix, that
<q>for <hi>piercing</hi> air we ſhould read <hi>piecing</hi> air.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>piecing</hi> air, it is true, is very much of a <hi>piece</hi> with the reſt of our editor's annotations; but what he means by it, I cannot conceive; any more than I can find out what Dr. Warburton means by the <hi>perpetual motion</hi> of the air, which prevents it from being injured by piercing. In my opinion, however, the meaning of Shakeſpeare in this paſſage is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious. It is notorious that the epithet <hi>ſtill-piercing,</hi> or <hi>ſilently-piercing,</hi> is applicable to the air on more occaſions than one. A cold air is a piercing air; and indeed, whether the air be cold or hot, it ſilently pierces or penetrates into the inmoſt receſſes of place, and even the pores of many apparently ſolid bodies. It is likewiſe notorious, that a cannon or muſket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball whizzes or whiſtles as it paſſes through or pierces the air; which being converted, poetica licentia, from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to the agent, and vice verſa, may, with great propriety, be ſaid to <hi>ſing with piercing,</hi> i. e. with <hi>being pierced,</hi> though it <hi>pierces ſilently</hi> itſelf. And thus we ſee evidently the antitheſis intended by the poet, which hath eſcaped the penetrating looks and piercing eyes of his commentators.</p>

                  <p>I judged it expedient to make ſo large a quotation from the text, in order that the reader might form ſome judgment of his own, before he entered on the perplexing annotations; to which two or three of the above lines have given riſe.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Warburton's note, as quoted by Dr. Johnſon, is as follows:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>What is not holy that we ſwear not</hi> BY.] Yes, nothing is more common than ſuch kind of oaths. But Diana is not here accuſing Bertram for ſwearing by a being not holy, but for ſwearing to an unholy purpoſe; as is evident from the preceding lines.
<q>
                           <l>'Tis not the many oaths, that make the truth;</l>
                           <l>But the plain ſingle vow, that is vow'd true.</l>
                        </q>
The line in queſtion, therefore, is evidently corrupt, and ſhould be read thus;
<q>What is not holy, that we ſwear, not <hi>'BIDES:</hi>
                        </q>
i. e. If we ſwear to an unholy purpoſe, the oath abides not, but is diſſolved in the making. This is an anſwer to the purpoſe. She ſubjoins the reaſon two or three lines after;
<q>
                           <l>—this has no <hi>holding,</hi>
                           </l>
                           <l>To ſwear by him, whom I proteſt to love;</l>
                           <l>That I will work againſt him.</l>
                        </q>
                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0047702200:134"/>
i. e. That oath can never hold, whoſe ſubject is to offend and diſpleaſe that being, whom I profeſs, in the act of ſwearing by him, to love and reverence.—What may have miſled the editors into the common reading was, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, miſtaking Bertram's words above,
<q>By love's own ſweet conſtraint,</q>
to be an oath; whereas it only ſignifies, being conſtrained by love.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This note of Dr. Warburton's, the argument of which is as falſe as the emendation propoſed is conſtrained and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, is highly commended by the preſent editor. His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notation is as follows:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>This is an acute and excellent conjecture, and I have done it the due honour of exalting it to the text; yet, methinks, there is ſomething yet wanting. The following words, <hi>but take the High'ſt to witneſs,</hi> even though it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as an anticipation or aſſumption in this ſenſe,—but now ſuppoſe that you <hi>take the</hi> High'ſt to witneſs,—has not ſufficient relation to the antecedent ſentence, I will propoſe a reading nearer to the ſurface, and let it take its chance.

Bertram means to enfore his ſuit, by telling her, that he has bound himſelf to her, not by the petty proteſtations uſual among lovers, but by vows of greater ſolemnity. She then makes a proper and rational reply.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, Dr. Johnſon conceives another part of the above quotation to be corrupt; which, as it may ſomething affect
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0047702200:135"/>
the ſenſe of the whole, I chuſe to take notice of here, altho' the editor conſiders it in a diſtinct note.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>To ſwear by him whom I proteſt to love,</l>
                     <l>That I will work againſt him:</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>This paſſage like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<q>appears to me corrupt. She ſwears not <hi>by</hi> him whom ſhe <hi>loves,</hi> but by <hi>Jupiter.</hi> I believe we may read <hi>to ſwear</hi> to <hi>him.</hi> There is, ſays ſhe, no holding, no conſiſtency, in ſwearing to one that <hi>I love him,</hi> when I ſwear it only to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure</hi> him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But farther, Dr. Johnſon, on reconſidering this paſſage, tells us, in his appendix, that
<q>in the print of the old folio, it is doubtful whether it is <hi>Jove's</hi> or <hi>Love's,</hi> the characters being not diſtinguiſhable. If it is read <hi>Love's,</hi> perhaps it may be ſomething leſs difficult. I am ſtill at a loſs.</q>
—And ſo, by this time, I preſume, is the reader. But, as the poet ſays,
<q>Who ſhall decide when doctors diſagree?</q>
Doubtleſs nobody leſs than he that has been dubb'd or capt twice; and he may authoritatively plead the ſame right of pre-eminence over a ſingle graduate, as <hi>two</hi> marrow-puddings have prerogatively over <hi>one</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>I hope none of the learned doctors of Oxford, Cambridge, or Dublin, nor even thoſe of Edinburgh, Glaſcow, or Lambeth, will be offended at the vulgarity of this compariſon. Had they been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted, however, with their doctorial dignities at Rheims, Louvain, or Harderwyk, they would readily ſee into the propriety of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring a diploma to a marrow-pudding. It is, indeed, a choice ſimile, but I cannot now tarry to illuſtrate it.</p>
                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>How far the author of the Reviſal may be qualified to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine this matter, I cannot pretend to ſay; being, to my regret, utterly unacquainted with the name and quality of that writer. But, as I think he hath explained this paſſage better than either of the graduated gentlemen above quoted, I ſhall not follow Dr. Johnſon's example, by cloathing his ſentiments in different words, and paſſing them off as my own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0047702200:136"/>The Reviſer's remarks on the paſſage in queſtion, are as follow:
<q>
                        <l>What is not holy, that we ſwear, not 'bides,—</l>
                        <l>But take the High'ſt to witneſs.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burton
<q>hath ſo ſtrangely puzzled himſelf about this paſſage, that he hath at laſt quite loſt ſight of its drift and purpoſe, and given us one of the moſt elaborate pieces of nonſenſe to be found in his whole performance. The common reading, however,
<q>
                           <l>What is not holy, that we ſwear not by,</l>
                           <l>But take the High'ſt to witneſs,</l>
                        </q>
is, if he could have been content with it, extremely plain and clear. The ſenſe is, We never ſwear by what is not holy, but ſwear by, or take to witneſs the higheſt, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. The tenor of the reaſoning contained in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing lines perfectly correſponds with this; if I ſhould ſwear by Jove's great attributes, that I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths, when you found by experience that I loved you ill, and was endeavouring to gain credit with you, in order to reduce you to your ruin! No, ſurely, but you would conclude that I had no faith either in Jove or his attributes, and that my oaths were mere words of courſe. For that oath can certainly have no tie upon us, which we ſwear by him we profeſs to love and honour, when at the ſame time we give the ſtrongeſt proof of our diſbelief in him, by purſuing a courſe, which we know will offend and diſhonour him.</q>
—</p>
                  <p>The Reviſer is here very near the truth, but hath neither fully confuted Dr. Warburton, nor prevented the difficulties ſuggeſted by Dr. Johnſon. He is alſo miſtaken in ſuppoſing the words <hi>this has no holding</hi> to mean <hi>ſuch an oath is not binding</hi>; ſince, be other matters as they may, nothing I think is plainer than that ſhe means, as Dr. Johnſon ſays, <hi>There is no conſiſtency.</hi> And this explanation of thoſe words, though
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0047702200:137"/>
it be our editor's own, is what militates againſt the alteration of <hi>by</hi> into <hi>to,</hi> as he propoſes; which alteration, however, is otherwiſe very plauſible, if the ſenſe of the paſſage had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely required it.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſee what we can make of it, without alteration.</p>
                  <p>Bertram tells Diana that he loves her, and he ſwears to it <hi>By love's own ſweet conſtraint.</hi> No, ſays Dr. Warburton, this is no oath; he only ſays he loves her by love's own ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; having ſaid in the preceding line, ſpeaking of Helena,
<q>
                        <l>I was compell'd to her, but I love thee</l>
                        <l>By love's own conſtraint.—</l>
                     </q>
But what is this but ſaying,
<q>
                        <hi>I was compelled to love Helena</hi> by my father, <hi>but I was compelled to love thee</hi> by Love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</q>
Thus we ſee, it is ſtill as Falſtaff ſays, upon <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion</hi>; and if readings were as plenty as black-berries, I would adopt none of them upon compulſion. Beſides, it does not appear that Bertram loves Helena at all. It is very preſumable that Bertram <hi>ſwore,</hi> from Diana's taking him ſo roundly to taſk for the profanity of his oath. He ſaid thus;
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>I was</hi> COMPELL'D <hi>to</hi> her, but I LOVE thee—</l>
                        <l>By <hi>LOVE's OWN</hi> ſweet conſtraint—</l>
                     </q>
i. e. I was forced to wed Helena, but thou art the woman I love.—She was my father's choice, thou art mine.—Yes, by all the powers of love, i. e. by that power which influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced my choice, thou art.—To which power, compared with the tyrannical authority of his father, he was very aptly and naturally induced to give the name of <hi>Love's own ſweet conſtraint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, ſuppoſing he did not mean to ſwear by the powers or power of love at this particular conjuncture, it appears, I think, pretty evident, that this was his uſual oath, or mode of vowing. Elſe, why ſhould he anſwer, after being ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0047702200:138"/>
ſchooled about his not ſwearing by the <hi>Higheſt,</hi> as the only holy object to ſwear by,
<q>
                        <l>—<hi>Love</hi> is <hi>holy.</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts,</l>
                        <l>That you do charge men with.</l>
                     </q>
What then becomes of Dr. Warburton's <hi>acute and excellent conjecture,</hi> to which Dr. Johnſon <hi>hath done the due honour of exalting it to the text?</hi> Dr. Warburton ſays, that <hi>Diana is not accuſing Bertram for ſwearing by a Being not holy, but for ſwearing to an unholy purpoſe.</hi> Indeed, ſhe is accuſing him of both, and pleads the former as a proof of the latter. You cannot ſwear, ſays ſhe, with any good deſign, or to any good purpoſe, when you ſwear by ſuch profane objects. For, it is to be obſerved, that the words <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>true</hi> are not here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the mere veracity of the terms of the oath <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>But, as in Pandulph's ſpeech, in the play of King John, page 449, where <hi>truth,</hi> applied alſo, in like manner, to an oath, relates, as our editor himſelf obſerves, to <hi>rectitude</hi> of conduct. Thus, when Diana ſays
<q>
                              <l>'Tis not the many oaths that make the <hi>truth</hi>;</l>
                              <l>But the plain ſingle vow, that is vow'd <hi>true</hi>;</l>
                           </q>
ſhe does not mean ſimply that a multiplicity of oaths will not make that true which is otherwiſe falſe; for this is not to be done at any rate; yet, what ſhe means to ſay is confeſſely to be effected by
<q>—the plain ſingle vow that is vow'd true.</q>
What ſhe means, therefore, is this; <hi>a multiplicity of vague and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane oaths</hi> will not juſtify any immoral conduct or deſign; but that any queſtionable deſign is to be juſtified only by the <hi>plain ſingle vow, that is vowed true</hi>; i. e. ſworn in a regular and ſacred manner. And hence ſhe proceeds to ſay,
<q>What is not holy that we ſwear not by, &amp;c.</q>
                        </p>
                     </note>. Diana did not doubt that Bertram had a love or a paſſion for her, according to the common acceptation of the term. It was to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0047702200:139"/>
the other part of his vow that ſhe alludes; for he not only tells her he <hi>loves</hi> her; but
<q>
                        <l>—will for ever</l>
                        <l>Do her all rights of ſervice.</l>
                     </q>
To which ſhe anſwers,
<q>
                        <l>Ay, ſo you ſerve us,</l>
                        <l>'Till we ſerve you: but when you have our roſes,</l>
                        <l>You barely leave our thorns to prick ourſelves,</l>
                        <l>And mock us with our bareneſs.</l>
                     </q>
To this Bertram eagerly replies,
<q>How have I ſworn!</q>
To which Diana as ſhrewdly anſwers—
<q>'Tis not the many oaths, &amp;c.</q>
As much as if ſhe had ſaid, <hi>Ay, how indeed!—by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of vague and profane oaths: but what are theſe, when there is neither a moral poſſibility of your performing your promiſe, nor would there be any moral rectitude in it if you did? For you cannot, in ſuch caſe, take a ſingle formal oath, and call the</hi> HIGHEST <hi>to witneſs the truth of your promiſe, without making a mock of his great attributes; viz. goodneſs and truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What then becomes of Dr. Johnſon's firſt alteration; his ſuppoſed neceſſity of dividing this ſpeech between Bertram and Diana; an alteration that would totally pervert the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the paſſage?</p>
                  <p>As to his latter alteration, though it be leſs exceptionable, it is equally unneceſſary. For, taking the meaning of the words in the ſenſe above-mentioned, the whole is perfectly intelligible and conſiſtent. <hi>If we take the High'ſt to witneſs,</hi> ſays Diana, (which, it is already obſerved, is done only when the intent of the oath is morally good) THEN, i. e. <hi>in that eaſe, pray tell me,</hi>
                     <q>If <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſwear by Jove's great attributes,</q>
i. e. goodneſs and truth,
<q>
                        <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0047702200:140"/>
                        <l>I <hi>LOV'D YOU</hi> dearly, would <hi>YOU</hi> believe <hi>MY</hi> oaths</l>
                        <l>When I did love you <hi>ILL</hi>?—</l>
                     </q>
i. e. wickedly, immorally.
<q>
                        <l>—This has no holding,</l>
                        <l>To ſwear by <hi>HIM,</hi> whom <hi>I</hi> proteſt to <hi>LOVE,</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>That I will work againſt him.</l>
                     </q>
i. e. This is inconſiſtent to ſwear by the God of truth and holineſs, whom I proteſt to love, that I will act diſhoneſtly and wickedly. Nay, ſhould we even admit with Dr. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burton and the Reviſer, that
<q>—This has no <hi>holding</hi>
                     </q>
means that the oath can never <hi>hold</hi> or is not <hi>binding</hi>; this will make no difference with regard to the alteration propoſed; the meaning of the lines, in that caſe, being only ſimilar to thoſe of Pandulph to King John:
<q>
                        <l>It is religion that doth make vows kept,</l>
                        <l>But thou haſt ſworn againſt religion:</l>
                        <l>By what thou ſwear'ſt againſt the thing thou ſwear'ſt.</l>
                     </q>
But it may be aſked, why doth Diana proteſt that ſhe loves the ſupreme Being by whom ſhe ſuppoſes herſelf to ſwear?—If we reflect, however, that this proteſtation is nothing more than that of her love to virtue, it is by no means improperly introduced to check Bertram's illicit paſſion, by depriving him of all hopes of ſucceſs. For it is to be remarked, that though ſhe barely mention the ill conſequences to herſelf of being afterwards abandoned by Bertram, the point on which ſhe dwells upon moſt, and ſeems to lay the greateſt ſtreſs, is the immorality of the act. It may be added alſo, that, as Bertram hath not here made uſe of that very expreſſion, in his vows to Diana, it is not impoſſible that ſhe refers to ſome other converſation, in which he had not only ſworn by love's own ſweet conſtraint, but alſo by <hi>her own ſweet ſelf,</hi> in which caſe it is, with great propriety, ſhe introduces, by way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titheſis, the proteſtation of her love to the God of truth and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0047702200:141"/>
goodneſs, being oppoſed to any love ſhe can poſſibly entertain for him.—And this ſuppoſition is not ill-founded, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on his calling her TITLED GODDESS, and his confeſſedly making uſe only of the oaths common to lovers.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>My mother told me juſt how he would woo,</l>
                     <l>As if ſhe ſate in's heart; ſhe ſays all men</l>
                     <l>Have the like oaths.—</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>As to the alteration, ſuggeſted in our editor's appendix, and founded on the bad print of the old folio, I am of a different opinion to Dr. Johnſon, and think that, inſtead of making the difficulty leſs, it would make it much greater. I give my vote, therefore, for having the text ſtand as it did, before either Dr. Warburton or Dr. Johnſon meddled with it;—except that the reader may, if he pleaſes, add a comma after HIM;
<q>To ſwear by HIM, whom I proteſt to love.</q>

                  <p>But why Parolles is like a cat, in reſpect to lighting upon his legs, I cannot, for the life of me, diſcover. Bertram had ſaid, on the diſcovery of Parolles to be a ſcoundrel, <hi>I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now he's a cat to me.</hi> On the expoſition of his farther baſeneſs, he ſays—<hi>he is more and more a cat</hi>; and at laſt, <hi>Pox on him, he's a cat ſtill.</hi> But, as Bertram gives no hint that he hates a cat for lighting upon her legs, I cannot conceive where Dr. Johnſon met with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for his explanation.</p>
                  <p>It appears alſo, that one of our editor's friends was as much at a loſs as I am; I mean Mr. Steevens, whoſe objection to this illuſtration is inſerted in the appendix.
<q>Bertram, ſays Mr. Steevens, means no ſuch thing. In a ſpeech or
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0047702200:142"/>
two before, he declares his averſion to a cat, and now only continues of the ſame opinion, and ſays, he hates Parolles as much as a cat.

Helen's merit: of all this Shakeſpeare could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; but Shakeſpeare wanted to conclude his play.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall not here undertake the defence of Shakeſpeare, as to the propriety of the King's readineſs to forgive Bertram, though I think it might eaſily be done, if we reflect that the match propoſed to the young prince was, in itſelf, very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and prepoſterous. The King laid the foundation for, and provoked, the act of diſobedience in his ſon, which was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more excuſable; for it will hardly be admitted, by any perſon in his right ſenſes, that the paternal authority of the King ought to have carried him ſo far as to degrade the heir apparent to his crown, by marrying him to the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a quack, merely becauſe ſhe had had the good luck, by one of her father's noſtrums, to cure his majeſty of a <hi>fiſtula in ano.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This circumſtance conſidered alſo, I think it ſhould have obtained ſome little favour for the character of Bertram in general, as well from our editor, as from the very ingenious authoreſs of <hi>Shakeſpeare Illuſtrated</hi>; for though he be on the whole a looſe, unprincipled fellow, yet I think the abſurdity and cruelty of this forced marriage affords a great palliation of his crimes.</p>
                  <p>But my reaſon for ſtopping at this paſſage, is to remark another inſtance of our editor's readineſs to cenſure Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare. Here, truly, Shakeſpeare hath done wrong in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting his dialogue,</hi> becauſe he was in a hurry to finiſh his play: whereas, before the end of the play, Dr. Johnſon finds fault with him again for making his <hi>dialogue too long</hi>

                           </q>—When was Shakeſpeare ever accuſed before of wilfully avoiding a proper opportunity of introducing pathetic ſcenes, on account of the <hi>difficulty</hi> of the taſk?</p>

                  <p>On this paſſage Mr. Theobald hath a long, and, I think, ſatisfactory note: he ſuppoſes the word <hi>Baſiliſco,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of <hi>Knight, Knight,</hi> to refer to an old ſtupid play called Soliman and Perſeda.—</p>
                  <p>Dr. Warburton tells us the beauty of the paſſage conſiſts in an alluſion to a fixed ſtar of the firſt magnitude in the conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Leo. Having inſerted the notes of both theſe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators at length, the preſent editor makes very ſhort work with his part of the buſineſs, by adding the following ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious animadverſion to the latter,
<q>Could one have thought it!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Could one have thought it, indeed! A mighty pretty way this, of writing annotations on Shakeſpeare! To copy two long notes from Theobald and Warburton, and then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, concerning ſome conundrum of the latter, <hi>Could one have thought it!</hi>—Neither your ſubſcribers, nor your book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, I believe, Dr. Johnſon, thought you would have fobbed them off ſo ſhabbily. For, indeed, when a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſo fair, <hi>Could one have thought it?</hi>—But, perhaps, this is another ſtroke of our editor's WIT.—It is.—ha!—like enough—but, <hi>could one have thought it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have in this play ſeveral other notes of ſimilar impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Thus page 421, after a long note from Theobald, our editor adds,
<q>Mr. Theobald had the art of making the

                  <p>In this paſſage our editor hath two notes from Theobald and Warburton; after which ne adopts the opinion of Mr. Edwards, who had expoſed the abſurdity of the latter, but without mentioning him, as uſual.—But I muſt not paſs over a word or two, which Dr. Johnſon hath dropt on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>A commentator,</hi> he ſays, <hi>ſhould be grave.</hi> But why, now, Doctor, ſhould a commentator be <hi>grave?</hi> You ſeem very angry, in your Preface, with Mr. Pope, for ſuppoſing that the taſk of an editor muſt neceſſarily be <hi>dull.</hi> Now, though there is ſome diſtinction of blood between dullneſs and gravity, they are near a-kin; and ſo nearly alike in the <hi>face,</hi> that you might take them for ſiſters; ay, twins, with but half-an-hour's difference in their age. I dare ſay now that many of your miſtaken readers have frequently thought even you <hi>dull,</hi> when I warrant you the <hi>Doctor</hi> was only <hi>grave.</hi> I do not think, therefore, a commentator ſhould wear ſo much gravity. It is good to guard againſt miſtakes, as they are frequently better prevented than amended. Not that I hold it decent for a ſcholiaſt to be always upon the broad grin; but if the author himſelf be chearful, or the abſurdities of a brother commentator ſet him a laughing, where is the crime of indulging himſelf in it?—After this, let us hear no more of the <hi>gravity</hi> of a commentator <note n="*" place="bottom">See Preface to Johnſon's Shakeſpeare.</note>.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The folio edition has it <hi>ſound</hi> ON; but our editor hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it either on the authority of Dr. Warburton, or his own, without giving any reaſon for ſuch alteration. His friend Mr. Steevens, however, thinks the old reading right, and conceives the meaning to be this;
<q>
                        <hi>if the midnight bell, by repeated ſtrokes, was to haſten away the race of beings that are buſy at that hour, or quicken night in its progreſs,</hi> the morning bell (that is the bell that ſtrikes <hi>one</hi>) could never properly be made the agent, for the bell has ceaſed to be in the ſervice of night when it proclaims the arrival of day. <hi>Sound</hi> ON has a particular propriety, becauſe, by the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtrokes at twelve, it gives a much more forcible warning than when it only ſtrikes <hi>one.</hi>
                     </q>
—This criticiſm is admitted by Dr. Johnſon into his appendix; but as he does not there retract his former judgment, we may ſuppoſe he ſtill coincides with Dr. Warburton: or perhaps his own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is ſuſpended between both. Mr. Steevens's note is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious enough indeed (as our editor expreſſes himſelf on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other occaſion) to <hi>deſerve to be true</hi>; but if the ſingle autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the folio edition may be ſet aſide, I am afraid the double authority of two ſuch learned and tremendous critics as Dr. Johnſon and the Biſhop of Glouceſter, will go likely to involve Shakeſpeare in the abſurdity of ſuppoſing the clock ſtrikes but <hi>one</hi> to acquaint us of <hi>midnight.</hi> For that the laſt right reverend critic doth not think midnight merely a point of time, dividing night from morning, is evident from his comment on another paſſage of Shakeſpeare's, in the Mid-ſummer Night's Dream, where, inſtead of <hi>the third part of a minute,</hi> he would have us read <hi>the third part of the midnight.</hi> Now points of time, as well as points of ſpace, are unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0047702200:147"/>
and indiviſible; and yet the preſent editor makes no other objection to this propoſed amendment, than that of ſilently rejecting it: but as this rejection is founded on other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons than the impropriety here mentioned, we may very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſuppoſe that Dr. Johnſon, as well as Dr. Warburton, hath found out that midnight is a determinate quantity of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, comprehending at leaſt all that ſpace of time which elapſes between twelve at night and one in the morning! This admitted, it is no wonder that Mr. Steevens's note ſhould appear exceptionable; for if <hi>he,</hi> on the ſuppoſition that when <hi>night</hi> is paſt it muſt be <hi>morning,</hi> can with propriety call the bell which ſtrikes <hi>twelve</hi> a midnight bell, <hi>they</hi> might with ſtill more propriety, on their ſuppoſition, call that a midnight bell which ſtrikes <hi>one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My readers will probably think I have here ſet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators together by the ears, only to perplex and confound both them and the poet.—Not at all.—The commentators were at odds before I meddled with them; and I have only brought them together, to ſhew my own critical dexterity in reconciling them to each other, and extricating Shakeſpeare out of the hands of both.—For inſtance, now—To you, Mr. Steevens, I attribute the honour or having illuſtrated the poet's meaning, on the ſuppoſition that he wrote <hi>ſtrike</hi> ON: but, Sir, I ſhall prove to your teeth, in ſavour of your opponents, that <hi>their</hi> reading of the text may be right; and this even from your own argument. You ſuppoſe that the bell, which ſtrikes <hi>one,</hi> is a morning bell—granted—it hath been ſo a full hour; ever ſince the hand came to the point, and the clapper ſtruck the firſt ſtroke of twelve. For you muſt not conceive that Time ſtands ſtock-ſtill till the clock hath done ſtriking the whole dozen: and if it does not, the bell muſt, according to you, be called a morning bell after the firſt ſtroke; ſo that we ſee there is even a phyſical impoſſibility of a <hi>midnight</hi> bell's ſtriking more than ONE. What then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of your repeated ſtrokes, and your midnight bell's
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0047702200:148"/>
ſtriking ON? <hi>Silence that dreadful bell, then, it diſturbs the</hi> text <hi>from its propriety.</hi>—EUGE, MAGNE.—Here was I going to congratulate myſelf on having topt all the commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, even in their <hi>own way,</hi> and on the wonderful acuteneſs diſplayed in <hi>adjuſting</hi> this nice diſpute; but recollecting the fate of poor Theobald, and how ſeverely he hath been handled for boaſting and <hi>making the moſt</hi> of his diſcoveries, I will wrap myſelf up in the buff doublet of my own ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, and leave the world to do juſtice to merit, or let it alone, as it thinks proper.</p>
