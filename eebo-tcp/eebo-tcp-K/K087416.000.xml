         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Privilege of ſo eaſy Acceſs to Your
Royal Highneſs, I dare ſay, I ſhall not
be the worſe receiv'd for bringing <hi>Ovid</hi>
along with me. He comes from Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
to the Fautreſs of Liberty;
from the Barbarous to the Polite; and has this to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him, which never fails with a Clemency, like Your's;
He is Unfortunate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0986500100:5"/>
Your Royal Highneſs, who feels for every one, has
lately been the mournful Occaſion of a like Senſibility
in many Others. Scarce an Eye, that did not tell the
Danger You were in: Even Parties, tho'different in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
united at that time in their grief, and affectionate
concern, for an event of ſo much conſequence to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of Humanity, and Virtue; whilſt Your Self was
the only Perſon, Then, unmov'd.</p>
            <p>It was remarkable, That She, who, with a Manner
moſt engaging, taught the innocent Pleaſures to appear
more deſirable, than the criminal; who was every day
the Life of ſome new agreeable Diverſion; ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
Her Self, upon that cruel Tryal, with a Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſo unſhaken, that thoſe who were Witneſſes might
have imagin'd, She ſcarce ever had done any thing, but
ſtudy how to Dye.</p>
            <p>It is the greateſt Happineſs can attend an Age un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a long depravation of Morals, to be bleſt with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
where Virtue is ſet off by the advantage of Birth.
Such Qualifications, when united, do not only perſuade
an Imitation, but Command it. Humane Nature is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
more affected by what it ſees, than what it hears of:
And as thoſe Ideas, which enter by the Eye, find the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
paſſage to the Heart; ſo the more the Object, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, ſeems deſirable to the One, the longer it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
in the Other.</p>
            <p>There are Perfections ſo ſhining, that one muſt be the
very Worſt of Mortals, or the very Beſt, not to admire
in all Thoſe who poſſeſs them. To be bleſt with a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to Charity, not confin'd by any other Limits, than
the Modeſty of thoſe who ask It: To know, and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb facs="tcp:0986500100:6"/>
to excuſe Faults; yet, ſo ſtrict in Life, as not to want
the like Indulgence; To have a Superiority of Genius
capable of judging of the higheſt Affairs, and an Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
ſo obſervant, as to penetrate into the moſt Minute:
To be eaſy to lay down Grandeur upon familiar Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and diſcerning to take It up, when Dignity of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
requires; To know the politer Languages of the
preſent Age, as a Native, and the greater Occurrences,
and Periods of the Paſt, as an Hiſtorian, make up a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
which is ſo obvious, that Every one will know
where to apply it, except the Perſon, whoſe it really is:
and if in this Your Royal Highneſs be at a Loſs, I think
it is the only thing within the Province of Your Sex
You are ignorant of.</p>
            <p>I ſhall take up no more of Your time in this Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Method I propoſe in writing this Preface, is to take
Notice of ſome of the Beauties of the <hi>Metamorphoſes,</hi> and
alſo of the Faults, and particular Affectations. After which
I ſhall proceed to hint at ſome Rules for Tranſlation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;
and ſhall give a ſhort Account of the following
Verſion.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not pretend to impoſe my Opinion on others with the magiſterial
Authority of a Critic; but only take the Liberty of diſcovering my own
Taſte. I ſhall endeavour to ſhow our Poet's Redundance of Wit, Juſtneſs
of Compariſons, Elegance of Deſcriptions, and peculiar Delicacy in touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every Circumſtance relating to the Paſſions, and Affections; and with
the ſame Impartiality, and Frankneſs, I ſhall confeſs the too frequent Pueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of his luxuriant Fancy, and the too great Negligence of his ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
unlabour'd Verſification.</p>
            <p>I am not of an Opinion, too common to Tranſlators, to think that One
is under an Obligation to extoll every thing he finds in the Author he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes:
I am ſure one is no more oblig'd to do ſo, than a Painter is to
make every Face that ſits to him handſome. 'Tis enough if he ſets the
beſt Features he finds in their full, and moſt advantageous Light. But if the
Poet has private Deformities, tho' Good-breeding will not allow to expoſe
him naked, yet ſurely there can be no Reaſon to recommend him, as the
moſt finiſh'd Model of Harmony, and Proportion.</p>
            <p>Whoever has this undiſtinguiſhing Complaiſance, will not fail to vitiate
the Taſte of the Readers, and miſguide many of them in their Judgment,
where to Approve, and where to Cenſure.</p>
            <p>It muſt be granted, that where there appears an infinite Variety of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable
Excellencies, it would be too harſh, and diſingenuous to be ſevere on
ſuch Faults, as have eſcap'd rather thro' want of Leiſure, and Opportunity to
correct, than thro' the erroneous Turn of a deprav'd Judgment. How
ſenſible <hi>Ovid</hi> himſelf was of the Uncorrectneſs of the <hi>Metamorphoſes,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

his Commentators;<q>

Since therefore the Readers are not ſolemnly invited to an Entertainment,
but come accidentally; they ought to be contented with what they find:
And pray what have they to complain of, but too great Variety? where,
tho' ſome of the Diſhes be not ſerv'd in the exacteſt Order, and Politeneſs,
but haſh'd up in haſte; there are a great many accommodated to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Palate.</p>
            <p>To like every thing, ſhows too little Delicacy; and to like nothing, too
much Difficulty. So great is the Variety of this Poem, that the Reader,
who is never pleas'd, will appear as monſtrous, as he that is always ſo. Here
are the Hurries of Battles for the Heroe, tender Emotions of Soul for the
Lover, a Search, and Penetration into Nature for the Philoſopher, Fluency
of Numbers, and moſt expreſſive Figures for the Poet, Morals for the Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and Plaiſantries for Admirers of Points of Wit.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain a Poet is more to be ſuſpected for ſaying too much, than too
little. To add is often hazardous; but to retrench, commonly judicious.
If our Author, inſtead of ſaying all he could, had only ſaid all he ſhould;
<hi>Daphne</hi> had done well to fly from the God of Wit, in order to crown his
Poet: Thus <hi>Ovid</hi> had been more honour'd, and ador'd in his Exile, than
<hi>Auguſtus</hi> in his Triumphs.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now attempt to give ſome Inſtances of the Happineſs, and vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of our Author's Imagination. I ſhall not proceed according to the
Order of the Poem, but rather tranſcribe ſome Lines here, and there, as
my Reflection ſhall ſuggeſt.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Nec circumſuſo pendebat in aere tellus</l>
               <l>Ponderibus librata ſuis—</l>
            </q>
            <p>Thus was the State of Nature before the Creation: And here it is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that <hi>Ovid</hi> had a diſcerning Notion of the Gravitation of Bodies. 'Tis now
demonſtrated, that every Part of Matter tends to every Part of Matter with
a Force, which is always in a direct ſimple Proportion of the Quantity of
the Matter, and an inverſe duplicate Proportion of the Diſtance; which Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
or Gravitating is conſtant, and univerſal. This Power, whatever it be,
acting always proportionably to the ſolid Content of Bodies, and never in any
Proportion to their Superficies; cannot be explain'd by any material Impulſe.
For the Laws of Impulſe are phyſically neceſſary: There can be no
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or arbitrary Principle in meer Matter; its Parts cannot move unleſs
they be mov'd; and cannot do otherwiſe, when preſs'd on by other Parts in
Motion; and therefore 'tis evident from the following Lines, that <hi>Ovid</hi>
ſtrictly adher'd to the Opinion of the moſt diſcerning Philoſophers, who
taught that all things were form'd by a wiſe, and intelligent Mind.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Juſſit &amp; extendi campos, ſubſidere valles,</l>
               <l>Fronde tegi ſylvas—</l>
            </q>
            <p>The <hi>Fiat</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Law-giver is not more ſublime, than the <hi>Juſſit</hi>
of the <hi>Latin</hi> Poet, who goes on in the ſame Elevated, and Philoſophical
Style.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0986500100:9"/>
               <l>His ſuper impoſuit liquidum, &amp; gravitate carentem</l>
               <l>Aethera—</l>
            </q>
            <p>Here the Author ſpreads a thin Veil of <hi>Aether</hi> over his Infant Creation;
and tho' his aſſerting the upper Region to be void of Gravitation, may not,
in a Mathematical Rigour, be true; yet 'tis found from the Natural Enquities
made ſince, and eſpecially from the learned Dr. <hi>Hally</hi>'s Diſcourſe on the
<hi>Barometer,</hi> that if, on the Surface of the Earth, an Inch of Quickſilver in
the Tube be equal to a Cylinder of Air of 300 Foot, it will be at a Mile's
height equal to a Cylinder of Air of 2700000: and therefore the Air at ſo
great a Diſtance from the Earth, muſt be rarify'd to ſo great a Degree, that
the Space it fills muſt bear a very ſmall Proportion to that which is entirely
void of Matter.</p>
            <p>I think, we may be confident from what already appears, as well as from
what our Author has writ on the <hi>Roman</hi> Feaſts, that he cou'd not be total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <hi>Virgil</hi> has alſo touch'd on the two laſt; in the one he had <hi>Lucretius</hi> in
View; in the other, <hi>Homer</hi>: and I think it will not be to the Diſadvantage
of our Author to appear at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>There are many other Deſcriptions ſcatter'd in the <hi>Metamorphoſes,</hi> which,
for juſt Expreſſion of Nature, and Majeſtick Modulation of Words, are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Inferior to thoſe already tranſcrib'd, as they are ſhorter; which makes
the Objection, that his Diction is commonly loytring into Proſe, a great
deal too ſevere.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Metamorphoſes</hi> muſt be conſider'd, as is obſerv'd before, very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>correct;
and <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Works as finiſh'd: tho' his own Modeſty wou'd not
allow the <hi>Aeneids</hi> to be ſo. It ſeems it was harder for him to pleaſe himſelf,
than his Readers. His Judgment was certainly great, nor was his Vivacity
of Imagination leſs; for the firſt without the laſt is too heavy, and like a
Dreſs without Fancy; and the laſt without the firſt is too gay, and but all
Trimming.</p>
            <p>Our Author's Similitudes are next to be conſider'd, which are always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably
ſhort, and convey ſome pleaſing Idea to the Imagination. 'Tis
in this Branch of the Poem, that he has diſcover'd as juſt a Judgement, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Claſſicks whatever. Poets, to give a Looſe to a warm Fancy, are
generally too apt, not only to expatiate in their Simile's, but introduce them
too frequently; by doing the firſt, they detain the Attention too long from
the principal Narration; and by the latter, they make too frequent Breaches
in the Unity of the Poem.</p>
            <p>Thoſe two Errors <hi>Ovid</hi> has moſt diſcerningly avoided. How ſhort, and
ſignificant are generally his Compariſons! he fails not, in theſe, to keep a
ſtiff Rein on a High-mettled <hi>Pegaſus</hi>; and takes care not to ſurfeit here, as
he has done on other Heads, by an erroneous Abundance.</p>

all a Simplicity, and a Confinement to the preſent Object; always a Fecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of Fancy, but rarely an Intemperance: nor do I remember he has err'd
above once by an ill-judg'd Superfluity. After he has deſcrib'd the Labyrinth

I really believe his excellent Poem had not been the leſs ſo, if, in
this Article, he had thought fit to have walk'd on in his own regular and
Majeſtick Grace, rather than have been hurry'd forward through broken
By-ways by his blind Guide.</p>

Compliments, and how natural his Tranſitions generally are. With how
much Eaſe does he ſlide into ſome new Circumſtance, without any Violation
of the Unity of the Story. The Texture is ſo artful, that it may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd

               <hi>Ovid</hi> never excells himſelf ſo much, as when he takes Occaſion to touch
upon the Paſſion of Love; all Hearts are in a manner ſenſible of the ſame
Emotions; and, like Inſtruments tun'd Uniſons, if a String of any one of

            <p>In the End, Inclination, as it does always, gets the better of Diſcretion.</p>
            <p>This laſt Fable ſhows how touchingly the Poet argues in Love Affairs, as
well as thoſe of <hi>Medea,</hi> and <hi>Scylla.</hi> The two laſt are left by their Heroes,
and their Reflections are very Natural, and Affecting. <hi>Ovid</hi> ſeem'd here to
have had <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Paſſion of <hi>Dido</hi> in his Eye, but with this difference; the
one had convers'd much with Ladies, and knew they lov'd to talk a great
deal: The other conſider'd no leſs what was natural for them to ſay, than
what became them to ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Virgil</hi> has, through the whole Management of this Rencounter, diſcover'd
a moſt finiſh'd Judgment. <hi>Aeneas,</hi> like other Men, likes for Convenience,
and leaves for greater. <hi>Dido,</hi> like other Ladies, reſents the Neglect, enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merates
the Obligations the Lover is under, upbraids him with Ingratitude,
threatens him with Revenge, then by and by ſubmits, begs for Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and has recourſe to Tears.</p>
            <p>It appears from this Piece, that <hi>Virgil</hi> was a diſcerning Maſter in the
Paſſion of Love: And they that conſider the Spirit, and Turn of that inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Line—<hi>Qui Bavium non odit</hi>—cannot doubt but he had an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Talent for Satyr.</p>
            <p>Nor does the Genius of <hi>Ovid</hi> more exert on the Subject of Love,
than on all others. In the Contention of <hi>Ajax, Ulyſſes</hi> his Elocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is moſt nervous, and perſwading. Where he endeavours to diſſwade Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
from indulging carnivorous Appetites in his Pythagorean Philoſophy,
how emphatical is his Reaſoning!</p>

I think <hi>Agricolam</hi> had been ſtronger, but the Authority of Manuſcripts
does not warrant that Emendation.</p>
            <p>Through the whole Texture of this Work, <hi>Ovid</hi> diſcovers the higheſt
Humanity, and a moſt exceeding good Nature. The Virtuous in Diſtreſs
are always his Concern; and his Wit contrives to give them an Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

the <hi>Metamorphoſes,</hi> tho' the Thirteenth abounds with Sentiments moſt

Poet had here in View, the Tragedy of <hi>Hecuba</hi> in <hi>Euripides</hi>; and 'tis a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
it has never been attempted in our own Tongue. The Houſe of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>

occaſion'd it. She is forc'd from the Arms of her unhappy Friends, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;d

knew how eſſential it was in Poetry to flatter the Ear; and at the ſame time
was ſenſible, that this Organ grows tir'd by a conſtant Attention to the ſame
Harmony; and therefore he endeavour'd now and then to relieve it by a
Cadence of Pauſes, and a Variation of Meaſures.</p>

who are too Dogmatical, and Self-ſufficient, when they preſume to

and Perſpicuity of his Allegories; which are either Phyſical or Natural;
Moral; or Hiſtorical. Of the firſt Kind is the Fable of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Python</hi>;
in the Explanation of this all the <hi>Mythologiſts</hi> agree; Exhalations and Miſts
being the conſtant Effects of Inundations, are here diſſipated by the Rays
of the Sun.</p>
            <p>Of the Second Kind, are <hi>Acteon</hi> torn to Pieces by his own Pack of Dogs,
and <hi>Eriſicthon</hi> ſtarv'd by the Diſeaſe of Hunger. Theſe two Allegories
ſeem to ſignify, that Extravagance and Luxury end in Want.</p>
            <p>Of the Third, is the Story of the Rape of <hi>Europa.</hi> Hiſtory ſays, ſhe
was Daughter to <hi>Agenor,</hi> and carry'd by the <hi>Candians</hi> in a Gally, bearing
a Bull in the Stern, in order to be marry'd to one of their Kings nam'd
<hi>Jupiter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Explanation gives an Occaſion for a Digreſſion which is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
foreign to the preſent purpoſe, becauſe it will be of Uſe to juſtify
<hi>Ovid</hi> on ſome other Occaſions, where he is cenſur'd for being too free with
the Characters of the Gods. I was once repreſenting the <hi>Metamorphoſes,</hi> as
an excellent Syſtem of Morality; but an illuſtrious Lady, whoſe leaſt
Advantage above her Sex, is that of being one of the greateſt Princeſſes in
<hi>Europe,</hi> objected, that the looſe and immodeſt Sallys of <hi>Jupiter</hi> did by
no means confirm my Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>One muſt conſider, that what appear'd an Abſurdity in <hi>Ovid,</hi> is not ſo
much his own Fault, as that of the Times before him. The Characters of
the Gods of the old Heroick Age repreſented them unjuſt in their Actions;
mutable in their Deſigns; partial in their Favours; ignorant of Events; ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
in their Language. Some of the ſuperior Hierarchy treating one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

the <hi>Iliad,</hi> will find, that the Author's Meaning, and their Interpretation are

the Pagan Theology; whiſt we aim at no more, than to judge of a little
common Senſe.</p>
            <p>It is, and ever will be a Rule to a great many, to applaud and condemn
with the general Vogue, tho' never ſo ill grounded. The moſt are affraid
of being Particular; and rather than ſtrive againſt the Stream, are proud
of being in the wrong with the Many, rather than deſirous of being in the
right with the Few: and tho' they be convinc'd of the Reaſonableneſs of
diſſenting from the common Cry, yet out of a poor fear of Cenſure, they
contribute to eſtabliſh it, and thus become an Authority againſt others,
who in reality are but of their own Opinion.</p>

               <hi>Ovid</hi> was ſo far from paying a blind deference to the venerable Name
of his <hi>Grecian</hi> Predeceſſor, in the Character of his Gods; that when <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
puniſhes <hi>Andromeda</hi> for the Crimes of her Mother, he calls him <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtus
Ammon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Met. B. 4.</note> and takes commonly an honourable care of the Decorum of the
Godhead, when their Actions are conſiſtent with the Divinity of their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.
His Allegories include ſome Religious, or inſtructive Moral, wrap'd up
in a peculiar Perſpicuity. The Fable of <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> being ſometimes in Hell,
and ſometimes with <hi>Ceres</hi> her Mother, can ſcarce mean any thing elſe than the
ſowing and coming up of Corn. The various Dreſſes, that <hi>Vertumnus,</hi> the
God of Seaſons, puts on in his Courtſhip of <hi>Pomona</hi> the Garden Goddeſs,
ſeem plainly to expreſs the different and moſt proper times for Digging,
Planting, Pruning, and gathering the Increaſe. I ſhall be ſhorter on this
Head, becauſe our Countryman Mr. <hi>Sands</hi> has, by a laborious Search a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Mythologiſts, been very full. He has annex'd his Explanations to
the end of each Book, which deſerve to be recommended to thoſe, that are
Curious in this figurative Learning.</p>
            <p>The Reader cannot fail of obſerving, how many excellent Leſſons of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
<hi>Ovid</hi> has given us in the courſe of his Fables.</p>
            <p>The Story of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> and <hi>Pyrrba</hi> teaches, that Piety and Innocence
cannot miſs of the divine Protection, and that the only Loſs irreparable is
that of our Probity, and Juſtice.</p>

That of <hi>Phaeton</hi>; how the too great tenderneſs of the Parent proves a
cruelty to the Child; and that he, who wou'd climb to the Seat of <hi>Jupiter,</hi>

            <p>The Tale of <hi>Baucis</hi> and <hi>Philemon</hi> is moſt inimitably told. He omits

a good old Couple; happy, and ſatisfy'd in a cleanly Poverty; hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and free of the few things, that Fortune had given them; moderate in
Deſires; affectionate in their conjugal Relation; ſo religious in Life, that
when they obſerv'd their homely Cabbin riſing to a Temple, all the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they ask'd of the Gods they had entertain'd, was, that they might do
the Office of Prieſthood there; and at their Death, not ſurvive one another.</p>
            <p>The Stories of <hi>Lycaon,</hi> and <hi>Pentheus,</hi> not only deter from Infidelity, and
Irreverence to the Gods; but the laſt alſo ſhows, that too great Zeal produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the ſame Effects, as none at all; and that Enthuſiaſm is often more cruel,
than Atheiſm.</p>
            <p>The Story of <hi>Minos,</hi> and <hi>Scylla</hi> repreſents the Infamy of ſelling our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and teaches, that even they who love the Crime, abhor the Criminal.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Cippus</hi> we find a noble Magnanimity, and Heavenly Self-denial: he
prefer'd the Good of the Republick to his own private Grandeur; and choſe
with an exemplary Generoſity, rather to live a private Free-Man out of
<hi>Rome,</hi> than to command Numbers of Slaves in it.</p>
            <p>From the Story of <hi>Hercules</hi> we learn, that Glory is a Lady, who, like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others, loves to have her Admirers ſuffer a great deal for her. The
Poet enumerates the Labours of the Heroe; ſhows how he conquer'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing for Others, but nothing for himſelf: Then does him the Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Juſtice of an Apotheoſis; thinking it moſt fit that one, who had born
the Celeſtial Orbs on his Shoulders, ſhou'd have a Manſion amongſt them.</p>
            <p>From the Aſſumption of <hi>Romulus</hi>; that when War is at an end, the chief
Buſineſs of Peace ſhould be the enacting good Laws; that after a People
are preſerv'd from the Enemy; the next care ſhou'd be, to preſerve them
from themſelves; and therefore the beſt Legiſlators deſerve a Place amongſt
Heroes, and Deities.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Ariadne</hi> being inhumanly deſerted by <hi>Theſeus,</hi> and generouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by <hi>Bacchus</hi> we find, that as there is nothing we can be ſure of, ſo
there is nothing we ought to deſpair of.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Althea</hi> burning the Brand; that we ſhou'd take care leaſt under the
Notion of Juſtice, we ſhou'd do a Cruelty; for they that are ſet upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
only endeavour to imitate the Injury.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Polyphemus</hi> making Love to <hi>Galatea</hi> one may obſerve, that the
moſt deform'd can find ſomething to like in thier own Perſon. He examines
his Face in the Stream, combs his ruful Locks with a Rake, grows more
exact, and ſtudious of his Dreſs, and diſcovers the firſt Sign of being in
Love, by endeavouring at a more, than uſual Care to pleaſe.</p>
            <p>The Fable of <hi>Cephalus,</hi> and <hi>Procrys</hi> confirms, that every Trifle contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
to heighten the Diſeaſe of Jealouſy; and that the moſt convincing
Proofs can ſcarce cure it.</p>
            <p>From that of <hi>Hippomenes,</hi> and <hi>Atalanta</hi> we may diſcover, that a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Preſent helps to perſuade, as well as an agreeable Perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0986500100:24"/>
From <hi>Medea</hi>'s flying from <hi>Pelias</hi>'s Court; that the offer'd Favours of the
Impious ſhould be always ſuſpected; and that they, who deſign to make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one fear them, are afraid of every one.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Myrrha</hi>; that Shame is ſometimes hard to be overcome, but if
the Sex once gets the better of it, it gives them afterwards no more Trouble.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Cenis</hi>; that Effeminacy in Youth may change to Valour in
Manhood, and that as Fame periſhes, ſo does Cenſure.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Tereus</hi>; that one Crime lays the Foundation of many; and that
the ſame Perſon, who begins with Luſt, may conclude with Murther.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Midas</hi>; that no Body can puniſh a Covetous Man worſe, than
he puniſhes himſelf; that ſcarce any thing wou'd ſometimes prove more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to us, than the Completion of our own Wiſhes; and that he who has
the moſt Deſires, will certainly meet with the moſt Diſappointments.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Philoſophy, it may be obſerv'd, that Man is the
only Animal who kills his Fellow-Creature without being angry.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Proteus</hi> we have this Leſſon, that a Stateſman can put on any
Shape; can be a Spaniel to the Lyon, and a Lyon to the Spaniel; and that
he knows not to be an Enemy, who knows not how to ſeem a Friend; that
if all Crowns ſhou'd change their Miniſtry, as often as they pleaſe, tho' they
may be call'd other Miniſters, they are ſtill the ſame Men.</p>
            <p>The Legend of <hi>Aeſculapiu</hi>'s Voyage to <hi>Rome</hi> in form of a Snake,
ſeems to expreſs the neceſſary Sagacity requir'd in Profeſſors of that Art,
for the readier Inſight into Diſtempers: This Reptile being celebrated by
the ancient Naturaliſts for a quick Sight.</p>

            <p>The whole Ode is in a manner a continu'd Compliment to his own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings;
nor, in Imitation of this celebrated Author, want we Poets of our
preſent Age, who have been pleas'd to rank themſelves amongſt their own
Admirers.</p>
            <p>I have done with the Original, and ſhall make no Excuſe for the length
of the Preface, becauſe it is in the power of the Reader to make is as ſhort
as he pleaſes. I ſhall now conclude with a Word or two about the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Tranſlation is commonly either Verbal, or Paraphraſe, or Imitation; of
the firſt ſort is Mr. <hi>Sands</hi>'s, which I think the <hi>Metamorphoſes</hi> can by no
means allow of. It is agreed, the Author left it unfiniſh'd; if it had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
his laſt Hand, it is more than probable, that many Superfluities had
been retrench'd. Where a Poem is perfectly finiſh'd; the Tranſlation, with
regard to particular Idioms, cannot be too exact; by doing this, the Senſe
of the Author is more entirely his own, and the Caſt of the Periods more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
preſerv'd: But where a Poem is tedious through Exuberance, or dark
through a haſty Brevity, I think the Tranſlator may be excus'd for doing
what the Author upon reviſing, wou'd have done himſelf.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Sands</hi> had been of this Opinion, perhaps other Tranſlations of
the <hi>Metamorphoſes</hi> had not been attempted.</p>
            <p>A Critick has obſerv'd, that in his Verſion of this Book, he has ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
confin'd the Number of his Lines to thoſe of the Original. 'Tis fit
I ſhould take the Summ upon Content, and be better bred, than to count
after him.</p>
            <p>The Manner that ſeems moſt ſuited for this preſent Undertaking, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to follow the Author too cloſe out of a Critical Timorouſneſs; nor aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
him too wantonly through a Poetick Boldneſs. The Original ſhould always
be kept in View, without too apparent a Deviation from the Senſe. Where
it is otherwiſe; it is not a Verſion, but an Imitation. The Tranſlator ought
to be as intent to keep up the Gracefulneſs of the Poem, as artful to hide
its Imperfections; to copy its Beauties, and to throw a Shade over its Blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes;
to be faithful to an Idolatry, where the Author excells; and to take
the Licence of a little Paraphraſe; where Penury of Fancy, or Dryneſs of
Expreſſion ſeem to ask for it.</p>
            <p>The Ingenious Gentlemen concern'd in this Undertaking ſeem to be of
this Opinion; and therefore they have not only conſulted the Reputation
of the Author, but their own alſo. There is one of them has no other
Share in this Compliment, than by being the Occaſion of engaging them
that have, in obliging the Publick. He has alſo ſo juſt to the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:0986500100:26"/>
and Reputation of Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> as to give his incomparable Lines the
Advantage of appearing ſo near his Own.</p>
            <p>I cannot paſs by that Admirable <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poet, without endeavouring to
make his Country ſenſible of the Obligations they have to his Muſe. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they conſider the flowing Grace of his Verſification; the vigorous Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of his Fancy; or the peculiar Delicacy of his Periods; they'll diſcover
Excellencies never to be enough admir'd. If they trace him from the firſt
Productions of his Youth, to the laſt Performances of his Age, they'll find,
that as the Tyranny of Rhyme never impos'd on the Perſpicuity of the
Senſe; ſo a languid Senſe never wanted to be ſet off by the Harmony of
Rhyme. And as his earlier Works wanted no Maturity; ſo his latter want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no Force, or Spirit. The falling off of his Hair, had no other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
than to make his Lawrels be ſeen the more.</p>
            <p>As a Tranſlator he was juſt; as an Inventer he was rich. His Verſions of
ſome parts of <hi>Lucretius, Horace, Homer,</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> throughout, gave him
a juſt pretence to that Compliment which was made to <hi>Monſieur d'Ablan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi>
a celebrated <hi>French</hi> Tranſlater; <hi>It is uncertain who have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Obligations to Him, the Dead or the Living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With all theſe wondrous Talents, He was Libell'd in his Life-time by the
very Men, who had no other Excellencies, but as they were his Imitators.
Where he was allow'd to have Sentiments ſuperior to all others, they charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with Theft: But how did he Steal? no otherwiſe, than like thoſe, that
ſteal Beggars Children, only to cloath them the better.</p>
            <p>'Tis to be lamented, that Gentlemen ſtill continue this unfair Behaviour,
and treat one another every Day with moſt injurious Libels. The Muſes
ſhould be Ladies of a chaſte and fair Behaviour: when they are otherwiſe,
they are Furies. 'Tis certain that <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> is at beſt but a barren Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and its Inhabitants contrive to make it more ſo by their un-neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Deportment; the Authors are the only Corporation that endeavour at
the Ruin of their own Society. Every Day may convince them, how much a
rich Fool is reſpected above a poor Wit. The only Talents in Eſteem at
preſent are thoſe of <hi>Exchange-Ally</hi>; one Tally is worth a Grove of Bays;
and 'tis of much more Conſequence to be well read in the Tables of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
and the Riſe and Fall of Stocks, than in the Revolution of Empires.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> is ſtill a ſad, and ſhameful Inſtance of this Truth: The Man, that
cou'd make Kings immortal, and raiſe triumphant Arches to Heroes, now
wants a poor ſquare Foot of Stone, to ſhow where the Aſhes of one of the
greateſt Poets, that ever was upon Earth, are depoſited.</p>

                  <l>Deduc'd from Nature's Birth, to <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Times.</l>
                  <l>Before the Seas, and this Terreſtrial Ball,</l>
                  <l>And Heav'ns high Canopy, that covers all,</l>
                  <l>One was the Face of Nature; if a Face,</l>
                  <l>Rather a rude and indigeſted Maſs:</l>
                  <l>A lifeleſs Lump, unfaſhion'd, and unfram'd,</l>
                  <l>Of jarring Seeds; and juſtly <hi>Chaos</hi> nam'd.</l>
                  <l>No Sun was lighted up, the World to view;</l>
                  <l>No Moon did yet her blunted Horns renew:</l>
                  <l>Nor yet was Earth ſuſpended in the Sky;</l>
                  <l>Nor pois'd, did on her own Foundations lye:</l>
                  <l>Nor Seas about the Shoars their Arms had thrown;</l>
                  <l>But Earth and Air and Water were in one.</l>

                  <l>To theſe inteſtine Diſcords put an end:</l>
                  <l>Then Earth from Air, and Seas from Earth were driv'n,</l>

                  <l>And foes are ſunder'd, by a larger ſpace.</l>
                  <l>The force of Fire aſcended firſt on high,</l>
                  <l>And took its dwelling in the vaulted Sky:</l>
                  <l>Then Air ſucceeds, in Lightneſs next to Fire;</l>
                  <l>Whoſe Atoms from unactive Earth retire.</l>
                  <l>Earth ſinks beneath, and draws a numerous throng</l>
                  <l>Of pondrous, thick, unwieldy Seeds along.</l>
                  <l>About her Coaſts, unruly Waters roar;</l>
                  <l>And, riſing on a ridge, inſult the Shoar.</l>

                  <l>He moulded Earth into a ſpacious Round:</l>
                  <l>Then with a breath, he gave the Winds to blow;</l>
                  <l>And bad the congregated Waters flow.</l>

                  <l>Walk'd the wide Circuit of the Heav'ns above,</l>
                  <l>To ſearch if any Cracks or Flaws were made;</l>
                  <l>But all was Safe: The Earth he then ſurvey'd,</l>

                  <l>And ev'ry Land; but on <hi>Arcadia</hi> moſt.</l>
                  <l>Her Fields he cloath'd, and chear'd her blaſted Face</l>
                  <l>With running Fountains, and with ſpringing Graſs.</l>
                  <l>No Tracks of Heav'ns deſtructive Fire remain,</l>
                  <l>The Fields and Woods revive, and Nature ſmiles again.</l>

                  <l>And rais'd the Plants, and gave the Spring its Birth,</l>
                  <l>By Chance a fair <hi>Arcadian</hi> Nymph he view'd,</l>
                  <l>And felt the lovely Charmer in his Blood.</l>
                  <l>The Nymph nor Spun, nor dreſs'd with artful Pride,</l>
                  <l>Her Veſt was gather'd up, her Hair was ty'd;</l>

In flow'ry Wreaths the Royal Virgin dreſt</l>
                  <l>His bending Horns, and kindly clapt his Breaſt.</l>
                  <l>Till now grown wanton, and devoid of Fear,</l>
                  <l>Not knowing that ſhe preſt the Thunderer,</l>

                  <l>O'er Fields and Meadows, ſeated on the God.</l>
                  <l>He gently march'd along, and by degrees</l>
                  <l>Left the dry Meadow, and approach'd the Seas;</l>
                  <l>Where now he dips his Hoofs and wets his Thighs,</l>

                  <l>The frighted Nymph looks backward on the Shoar,</l>

                  <l>Her Train of ruffling Garments flies behind,</l>
                  <l>Swells in the Air, and hovers in the Wind.</l>

His tow'ring Creſt was glorious to behold,</l>
                  <l>His Shoulders and his Sides were ſcal'd with Gold;</l>
                  <l>Three Tongues he brandiſh'd when he charg'd his Foes;</l>

                  <l>The <hi>Tyrians</hi> in the Den for Water ſought,</l>
                  <l>And with their Urns explor'd the hollow Vault:</l>

Inur'd to Blood; the far-deſtroying Dart;</l>
                  <l>And, the beſt Weapon, an undaunted Heart.</l>
                  <l>Soon as the Youth approach'd the fatal Place,</l>

                  <l>That, firmly join'd, preſerv'd him from a Wound,</l>
                  <l>With native Armour cruſted all around.</l>
                  <l>The pointed Jav'lin more ſucceſsful flew,</l>
                  <l>Which at his Back the raging Warriour threw;</l>
                  <l>Amid the plaited Scales it took its Courſe,</l>
                  <l>And in the ſpinal Marrow ſpent its Force.</l>
                  <l>The Monſter hiſs'd aloud, and rag'd in vain,</l>
                  <l>And writh'd his Body to and fro with Pain;</l>
                  <l>And bit the Spear, and wrench'd the Wood away;</l>
                  <l>The Point ſtill buried in the Marrow lay.</l>
                  <l>And now his Rage, increaſing with his Pain,</l>
                  <l>Reddens his Eyes, and beats in ev'ry Vein;</l>
                  <l>Churn'd in his Teeth the foamy Venom roſe,</l>
                  <l>Whilſt from his Mouth a Blaſt of Vapours flows,</l>

Now, like a Torrent, with a mighty Force</l>

                  <l>

Whatever ſlew thee, I the Cauſe remain,</l>
                  <l>I nam'd, and fix'd the Place, where thou waſt ſlain.</l>

Still as ſhe doubts, her Eyes a Body found</l>

                  <l>While yet he ſpoke, the dying Accents hung</l>
                  <l>In Sounds imperfect on his Marble Tongue;</l>
                  <l>Tho' chang'd to Stone, his Lips he ſeem'd to ſtretch,</l>

Once, I remember, in the Summer's Heat,</l>
                  <l>Tir'd with the Chaſe, I ſought a cool Retreat;</l>
                  <l>And, walking on, a ſilent Current found,</l>
                  <l>Which gently glided o'er the grav'ly Ground.</l>
                  <l>The chryſtal Water was ſo ſmooth, ſo clear,</l>
                  <l>My Eye diſtinguiſh'd ev'ry Pebble there.</l>
                  <l>So ſoft its Motion, that I ſcarce perceiv'd</l>
                  <l>The running Stream, or what I ſaw, believ'd.</l>
                  <l>The hoary Willow, and the Poplar made</l>
                  <l>Along the ſhelving Bank a grateful Shade.</l>
                  <l>In the cool Rivulet my Feet I dipt,</l>
                  <l>Then waded to the Knee, and then I ſtript;</l>
                  <l>My Robe I careleſs on an Oſier threw,</l>
                  <l>That near the Place commodiouſly grew,</l>
                  <l>Nor long upon the Border naked ſtood,</l>
                  <l>But plung'd with Speed into the ſilver Flood.</l>
                  <l>My Arms a thouſand ways I mov'd, and try'd</l>
                  <l>To quicken, if I cou'd, the lazy Tide;</l>
                  <l>Where, while I play'd my ſwimming Gambols o'er,</l>
                  <l>I heard a murm'ring Voice, and frighted ſprung to Shore.</l>
                  <l>Oh! whither, <hi>Arethuſa,</hi> doſt thou fly?</l>
                  <l>From the Brook's Bottom did <hi>Alpheus</hi> cry;</l>

                  <l>Naked I flew, nor cou'd I ſtay to hide</l>
                  <l>My Limbs, my Robe was on the other Side;</l>
                  <l>

                  <l>Quicken'd his Speed, and made his Labour light;</l>

                  <l>And with a greedy Glance devours my Charms.</l>

It was a Fault, but not of Guilt, to move</l>
                  <l>Such Puniſhment, a Fault of too much Love.</l>
                  <l>Thus I retriev'd her to my longing Arms,</l>
                  <l>And many happy Days poſſeſs'd her Charms.</l>
                  <l>But with herſelf ſhe kindly did confer,</l>
                  <l>What Gifts the Goddeſs had beſtow'd on her;</l>
                  <l>The fleeteſt Grey-hound, with this lovely Dart,</l>
                  <l>And I of both have Wonders to impart.</l>
                  <l>Near <hi>Thebes</hi> a Savage Beaſt, of Race unknown,</l>
                  <l>Laid waſte the Field, and bore the Vineyards down;</l>
                  <l>The Swains fled from him, and with one Conſent</l>
                  <l>Our <hi>Grecian</hi> Youth to chaſe the Monſter went;</l>
                  <l>More ſwift than Light'ning he the Toils ſurpaſt,</l>
                  <l>And in his Courſe Spears, Men, and Trees o'er-caſt.</l>
                  <l>We ſlipt our Dogs, and laſt my <hi>Lelaps</hi> too,</l>
                  <l>When none of all the mortal Race wou'd do:</l>
                  <l>He long before was ſtruggling from my Hands,</l>
                  <l>And, e're we cou'd unlooſe him, broke his Bands.</l>
                  <l>That Minute where he was we cou'd not find,</l>
                  <l>And only ſaw the Duſt he left behind.</l>
                  <l>I climb'd a neighb'ring Hill to view the Chaſe,</l>
                  <l>While in the Plain they held an equal Race;</l>
                  <l>The Savage now ſeems caught, and now by Force</l>
                  <l>To quit himſelf, nor holds the ſame ſtrait Courſe;</l>
                  <l>But running counter, from the Foe withdraws,</l>
                  <l>And with ſhort Turning cheats his gaping Jaws:</l>
                  <l>Which he retrieves, and ſtill ſo cloſely preſt,</l>
                  <l>You'd fear at ev'ry Stretch he were poſſeſs'd;</l>

                  <l>The Game ſhoots from him, and he chops the Air.</l>
                  <l>To caſt my Jav'lin then I took my Stand;</l>
                  <l>But as the Thongs were fitting to my Hand,</l>

While to the Valley I o'er-look'd the Wood,</l>
                  <l>Before my Eyes two Marble Statues ſtood.</l>
                  <l>That, as purſu'd, appearing at full Stretch,</l>
                  <l>This barking after, and at point to catch.</l>
                  <l>Some God their Courſe did with this Wonder grace,</l>

                  <l>The eager Prince then urg'd him to impart,</l>

                  <l>For Bliſs was the Foundation of my Fate.</l>
                  <l>No Language can thoſe happy Hours expreſs,</l>
                  <l>Did from our Nuptials me and <hi>Procris</hi> bleſs:</l>
                  <l>The kindeſt Pair! What more cou'd Heav'n confer?</l>
                  <l>For She was all to me, and I to her.</l>

                  <l>And I my <hi>Procris</hi> more than <hi>Venus</hi> priz'd:</l>
                  <l>Thus while no other Joy we did aſpire,</l>
                  <l>We grew at laſt one Soul, and one Deſire.</l>

                  <l>Nor yet for Servant, Horſe, or Dog did call,</l>
                  <l>I found this ſingle Dart to ſerve for all.</l>
                  <l>With Slaughter tir'd, I ſought the cooler Shade,</l>
                  <l>And Winds that from the Mountains pierc'd the Glade:</l>
                  <l>Come, gentle Air, (ſo was I wont to ſay)</l>
                  <l>Come, gentle Air, ſweet <hi>Aura</hi> come away.</l>
                  <l>This always was the Burden of my Song,</l>

Theſe Blandiſhments, and more than theſe, I ſaid,</l>

                  <l>And then to curſe th' imagin'd Nymph began:</l>
                  <l>Yet oft ſhe doubts, oft hopes ſhe is deceiv'd,</l>

                  <l>Next Morn I to the Woods again repair,</l>
                  <l>And, weary with the Chaſe, invoke the Air;</l>

To draw the Dart, her Love's dear fatal Gift!</l>
                  <l>My guilty Arms had ſcarce the Strength to lift</l>
                  <l>The beauteous Load; my Silks and Hair I tore</l>
                  <l>(If poſſible) to ſtanch the preſſing Gore;</l>
                  <l>For Pity begg'd her keep her flitting Breath,</l>

                  <l>While I intreat ſhe fainted faſt away,</l>
                  <l>And theſe few Words had only Strength to ſay;</l>

And now her Eyes and Cheeks with Fury glow,</l>

T was on a Day more ſolemn than the reſt,</l>
                  <l>Then Bullocks ſlain, a Sacrificial Feaſt:</l>
                  <l>The rural Gods of all the Region near</l>
                  <l>They bid to dance, and taſte the hallow'd Cheer.</l>
                  <l>Me they forgot: Affronted with the Slight,</l>
                  <l>My Rage and Stream ſwell'd to the greateſt Height;</l>
                  <l>And with the Torrent of my flooding Store,</l>
                  <l>Large Woods from Woods, and Fields from Fields I tore.</l>
                  <l>The guilty Nymphs, Oh! then, remembring me,</l>
                  <l>I, with their Country, waſh'd into the Sea;</l>
                  <l>And joining Waters with the ſocial Main,</l>
                  <l>Rent the groſs Land, and ſplit the firm Champagne.</l>

                  <l>By Proof to clear your Doubt; In <hi>Phrygian</hi> Ground</l>
                  <l>Two neighb'ring Trees, with Walls encompaſs'd round,</l>
                  <l>Stand on a mod'rate Riſe, with Wonder ſhown,</l>

                  <l>Of Coots, and of the fiſhing Cormorant:</l>
                  <l>Here <hi>Jove</hi> with <hi>Hermes</hi> came; but in Diſguiſe</l>
                  <l>Of mortal Men conceal'd their Deities;</l>
                  <l>One laid aſide his Thunder, one his Rod;</l>

                  <l>There <hi>Baucis</hi> and <hi>Philemon</hi> liv'd, and there</l>

                  <l>Or rather both commanded, both obey'd.</l>
                  <l>From lofty Roofs the Gods repuls'd before,</l>

                  <l>A common Settle drew for either Gueſt,</l>

                  <l>With Leaves and Bark ſhe feeds her Infant Fire:</l>
                  <l>It ſmoaks; and then with trembling Breath ſhe blows,</l>
                  <l>Till in a chearful Blaze the Flames aroſe.</l>
                  <l>With Bruſh-wood, and with Chips ſhe ſtrengthens theſe,</l>

                  <l>(Like burniſh'd Gold the little Seether ſhone)</l>
                  <l>Next took the Coleworts which her Husband got</l>
                  <l>From his own Ground, (a ſmall well-water'd Spot;)</l>
                  <l>She ſtripp'd the Stalks of all their Leaves; the beſt</l>

                  <l>The Time between, before the Fire they ſat,</l>
                  <l>And ſhorten'd the Delay by pleaſing Chat.</l>
                  <l>A Beam there was, on which a Beechen Pail</l>
                  <l>Hung by the Handle, on a driven Nail:</l>
                  <l>This fill'd with Water, gently warm'd, they ſet</l>
                  <l>Before their Gueſts; in this they bath'd their Feet,</l>

                  <l>All theſe in Earthen Ware were ſerv'd to Board;</l>

                  <l>Abhorr'd all Womankind, but moſt a Wife:</l>
                  <l>So ſingle choſe to live, and ſhunn'd to wed,</l>
                  <l>Well pleas'd to want a Conſort of his Bed.</l>
                  <l>Yet fearing Idleneſs, the Nurſe of Ill,</l>
                  <l>In Sculpture exercis'd his happy Skill;</l>
                  <l>And carv'd in Iv'ry ſuch a Maid, ſo fair,</l>
                  <l>As Nature could not with his Art compare,</l>
                  <l>Were ſhe to work; but in her own Defence</l>
                  <l>Muſt take her Pattern here, and copy hence.</l>
                  <l>Pleas'd with his Idol, he commends, admires,</l>
                  <l>Adores; and laſt, the Thing ador'd, deſires.</l>
                  <l>A very Virgin in her Face was ſeen,</l>
                  <l>And had ſhe mov'd, a living Maid had been:</l>
                  <l>One wou'd have thought ſhe cou'd have ſtirr'd, but ſtrove</l>
                  <l>With Modeſty, and was aſham'd to move.</l>
                  <l>Art hid with Art, ſo well perform'd the Cheat,</l>
                  <l>It caught the Carver with his own Deceit:</l>
                  <l>He knows 'tis Madneſs, yet he muſt adore,</l>
                  <l>And ſtill the more he knows it, loves the more:</l>
                  <l>The Fleſh, or what ſo ſeems, he touches oft,</l>
                  <l>Which feels ſo ſmooth, that he believes it ſoft.</l>
                  <l>Fir'd with this Thought, at once he ſtrain'd the Breaſt,</l>
                  <l>And on the Lips a burning Kiſs impreſs'd.</l>
                  <l>'Tis true, the harden'd Breaſt reſiſts the Gripe,</l>
                  <l>And the cold Lips return a Kiſs unripe:</l>
                  <l>But when, retiring back, he look'd again,</l>
                  <l>To think it Iv'ry, was a Thought too mean:</l>

                  <l>Again embrac'd her naked Body o'er;</l>
                  <l>And ſtraining hard the Statue, was afraid</l>
                  <l>His Hands had made a Dint, and hurt his Maid:</l>
                  <l>Explor'd her Limb by Limb, and fear'd to find</l>
                  <l>So rude a Gripe had left a livid Mark behind:</l>
                  <l>With Flatt'ry now he ſeeks her Mind to move,</l>
                  <l>And now with Gifts, (the pow'rful Bribes of Love:)</l>
                  <l>He furniſhes her Cloſet firſt; and fills</l>
                  <l>The crowded Shelves with Rarities of Shells;</l>
                  <l>Adds Orient Pearls, which from the Conchs he drew,</l>
                  <l>And all the ſparkling Stones of various Hue:</l>
                  <l>And Parrots, imitating Human Tongue,</l>
                  <l>And Singing-birds in Silver Cages hung;</l>
                  <l>And ev'ry fragrant Flow'r, and od'rous Green</l>
                  <l>Were ſorted well, with Lumps of Amber laid between:</l>
                  <l>Rich faſhionable Robes her Perſon deck,</l>
                  <l>Pendants her Ears, and Pearls adorn her Neck:</l>
                  <l>Her taper'd Fingers too with Rings are grac'd,</l>
                  <l>And an embroider'd Zone ſurrounds her ſlender Waſte.</l>
                  <l>Thus like a Queen array'd, ſo richly dreſs'd,</l>
                  <l>Beauteous ſhe ſhew'd, but naked ſhew'd the beſt.</l>
                  <l>Then, from the Floor, he rais'd a Royal Bed,</l>
                  <l>With Cov'rings of <hi>Sydonian</hi> Purple ſpread:</l>
                  <l>The ſolemn Rites perform'd, he calls her Bride,</l>
                  <l>With Blandiſhments invites her to his Side;</l>
                  <l>And as ſhe were with vital Senſe poſſeſs'd,</l>
                  <l>Her Head did on a plumy Pillow reſt.</l>
                  <l>The Feaſt of <hi>Venus</hi> came, a ſolemn Day,</l>
                  <l>To which the <hi>Cypriots</hi> due Devotion pay;</l>

                  <l>If all we can require, be yours to grant;</l>

                  <l>The Golden Goddeſs, preſent at the Pray'r,</l>

                  <l>For thrice in chearful Flames aſcends the Fire.</l>
                  <l>The Youth, returning to his Miſtreſs, hies,</l>
                  <l>And impudent in Hope, with ardent Eyes,</l>
                  <l>And beating Breaſt, by the dear Statue lies.</l>
                  <l>He kiſſes her white Lips, renews the Bliſs,</l>
                  <l>And looks, and thinks they redden at the Kiſs;</l>
                  <l>He thought them warm before: Nor longer ſtays,</l>

O'er the moſt rugged Ways ſo faſt he ran,</l>

                  <l>And ſought in Sleep her weary'd Eyes to cloſe:</l>
                  <l>Her Husband's Pillow, and the widow'd part</l>
                  <l>Which once he preſs'd, renew'd the former Smart.</l>
                  <l>And now a Breeze from Shoar began to blow,</l>
                  <l>The Sailors ſhip their Oars, and ceaſe to row;</l>
                  <l>Then hoiſt their Yards a-trip, and all their Sails</l>
                  <l>Let fall, to court the Wind, and catch the Gales:</l>
                  <l>By this the Veſſel half her Courſe had run,</l>

Both Shoars were loſt to Sight, when at the Cloſe</l>
                  <l>Of Day a ſtiffer Gale at Eaſt aroſe:</l>
                  <l>The Sea grew white, the rowling Waves from far,</l>
                  <l>Like Heralds, firſt denounce the wat'ry War.</l>
                  <l>This ſeen, the Maſter ſoon began to cry,</l>
                  <l>Strike, ſtrike the Top-ſail; let the Main-ſheet fly,</l>
                  <l>And furl your Sails: The Winds repel the Sound,</l>
                  <l>And in the Speaker's Mouth the Speech is drown'd.</l>
                  <l>Yet of their own Accord, as Danger taught</l>
                  <l>Each in his Way, officiouſly they wrought;</l>
                  <l>Some ſtow their Oars, or ſtop the leaky Sides,</l>
                  <l>Another bolder yet the Yard beſtrides,</l>
                  <l>And folds the Sails; a fourth with Labour laves</l>
                  <l>Th' intruding Seas, and Waves ejects on Waves.</l>
                  <l>In this Confuſion while their Work they ply,</l>
                  <l>The Winds augment the Winter of the Sky,</l>
                  <l>And wage inteſtine Wars; the ſuff'ring Seas</l>
                  <l>Are toſs'd, and mingled as their Tyrants pleaſe.</l>
                  <l>The Maſter would command, but in deſpair</l>
                  <l>Of Safety, ſtands amaz'd with ſtupid Care,</l>
                  <l>Nor what to bid, or what forbid he knows,</l>
                  <l>Th' ungovern'd Tempeſt to ſuch Fury grows:</l>
                  <l>Vain is his Force, and vainer is his Skill;</l>
                  <l>With ſuch a Concourſe comes the Flood of Ill:</l>
                  <l>The Cries of Men are mix'd with rattling Shrowds;</l>
                  <l>Seas daſh on Seas, and Clouds encounter Clouds:</l>
                  <l>At once from Eaſt to Weſt, from Pole to Pole,</l>
                  <l>The forky Lightnings flaſh, the roaring Thunders roul.</l>
                  <l>Now Waves on Waves aſcending ſcale the Skies,</l>
                  <l>And in the Fires above the Water fries:</l>
                  <l>When yellow Sands are ſifted from below,</l>
                  <l>The glitt'ring Billows give a golden Show:</l>

And when the fouler Bottom ſpews the Black,</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Stygian</hi> Dye the tainted Waters take:</l>
                  <l>Then frothy White appear the flatted Seas,</l>

                  <l>Like various Fits the <hi>Trachin</hi> Veſſel finds,</l>

                  <l>Now from the Depth of Hell they lift their Sight,</l>

                  <l>The laſhing Billows make a loud Report,</l>
                  <l>And beat her Sides, as batt'ring Rams a Fort:</l>
                  <l>Or as a Lyon bounding in his way,</l>
                  <l>With Force augmented, bears againſt his Prey,</l>

                  <l>Springs on the Toils, and ruſhes on the Spear:</l>
                  <l>So Seas impell'd by Winds, with added Pow'r</l>
                  <l>Aſſault the Sides, and o'er the Hatches tow'r.</l>
                  <l>The Planks (their pitchy Cov'ring waſh'd away)</l>
                  <l>Now yield; and now a yawning Breach diſplay:</l>
                  <l>The roaring Waters with a hoſtile Tide</l>
                  <l>Ruſh through the Ruins of her gaping Side.</l>
                  <l>Mean time in Sheets of Rain the Sky deſcends,</l>
                  <l>And Ocean ſwell'd with Waters upwards tends;</l>
                  <l>One riſing, falling one, the Heav'ns and Sea</l>
                  <l>Meet at their Confines, in the middle Way:</l>
                  <l>The Sails are drunk with Show'rs, and drop with Rain,</l>
                  <l>Sweet Waters mingle with the briny Main.</l>
                  <l>No Star appears to lend his friendly Light;</l>
                  <l>Darkneſs and Tempeſt make a double Night;</l>
                  <l>But flaſhing Fires diſcloſe the Deep by turns,</l>
                  <l>And while the Light'nings blaze, the Water burns.</l>

Now all the Waves their ſcatter'd Force unite,</l>
                  <l>And, as a Soldier, foremoſt in the Fight,</l>
                  <l>Makes way for others, and an Hoſt alone</l>

                  <l>An univerſal Cry reſounds aloud,</l>

                  <l>As many Waves, as many Deaths appear.</l>
                  <l>One weeps, and yet deſpairs of late Relief;</l>
                  <l>One cannot weep, his Fears congeal his Grief,</l>
                  <l>But ſtupid, with dry Eyes expects his Fate:</l>

                  <l>For, often he had heard his Father ſay,</l>

                  <l>You might have nam'd <hi>Alcides</hi> at the leaſt:</l>

                  <l>Sigh'd ere he ſpoke; then made this proud Defence.</l>
                  <l>My former Woes in long Oblivion drown'd,</l>

                  <l>Better to paſs him o'er, than to relate</l>

                  <l>His Fame has fill'd the World, and reach'd the Sky;</l>
                  <l>(Which, Oh, I wiſh, with Truth, I cou'd deny!)</l>
                  <l>We praiſe not <hi>Hector</hi>; though his Name, we know,</l>
                  <l>Is great in Arms; 'tis hard to praiſe a Foe.</l>
                  <l>He, your great Father, levell'd to the Ground</l>
                  <l>

                     <hi>Elis,</hi> and <hi>Pylos</hi>; That a neighb'ring State,</l>
                  <l>And This my own: Both guiltleſs of their Fate.</l>
                  <l>To paſs the reſt, twelve, wanting one, he ſlew;</l>
                  <l>My Brethren, who their Birth from <hi>Neleus</hi> drew.</l>

                  <l>And in his Pinion fix'd the feather'd Wood.</l>
                  <l>Light was the Wound; but in the Sinew hung</l>
                  <l>The Point; and his diſabled Wing unſtrung.</l>
                  <l>He wheel'd in Air, and ſtretch'd his Vans in vain;</l>
                  <l>His Vans no longer cou'd his Flight ſuſtain:</l>

                  <l>Hung drooping down, nor pois'd his other Side.</l>
                  <l>He fell: The Shaft that ſlightly was impreſs'd,</l>
                  <l>Now from his heavy Fall with weight increas'd,</l>
                  <l>Drove through his Neck, aſlant; he ſpurns the Ground,</l>
                  <l>And the Soul iſſues through the Weazon's Wound.</l>
                  <l>Now, brave Commander of the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Seas,</l>
                  <l>What Praiſe is due from me, to <hi>Hercules</hi>?</l>
                  <l>Silence is all the Vengeance I decree</l>
                  <l>For my ſlain Brothers; but 'tis Peace with thee.</l>

                  <l>And feign'd Diſtraction to conceal his Fear:</l>

                  <l>(Ill for himſelf) and dragg'd him into War.</l>

                  <l>Robb'd of my Kinſman's Arms, who firſt appear'd in Fight.</l>
                  <l>Better for us, at home had he remain'd,</l>

                  <l>The due Reward to him who caus'd his Ill.</l>

                  </l>
                  <l>Yet ſtill he lives, and lives from Treaſon free,</l>

The Coward bore the Man immortal Spight,</l>
                  <l>Who ſham'd him out of Madneſs into Fight:</l>
                  <l>Nor daring otherwiſe to vent his Hate,</l>
                  <l>Accus'd him firſt of Treaſon to the State;</l>
                  <l>And then for proof produc'd the golden Store,</l>
                  <l>Himſelf had hidden in his Tent before:</l>
                  <l>Thus of two Champions he depriv'd our Hoſt,</l>
                  <l>By Exile one, and one by Treaſon loſt.</l>
                  <l>Thus fights <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> thus his Fame extends,</l>
                  <l>A formidable Man, but to his Friends:</l>
                  <l>Great, for what Greatneſs is in Words and Sound,</l>

                  <l>But that he might without a Rival reign,</l>
                  <l>He left this faithful <hi>Neſtor</hi> on the Plain;</l>
                  <l>Forſook his Friend ev'n at his utmoſt Need,</l>
                  <l>Who tir'd, and tardy with his wounded Steed,</l>
                  <l>Cry'd out for Aid, and call'd him by his Name;</l>
                  <l>But Cowardice has neither Ears nor Shame:</l>
                  <l>Thus fled the good old Man, bereft of Aid,</l>
                  <l>And, for as much as lay in him, betray'd:</l>
                  <l>That this is not a Fable forg'd by me,</l>
                  <l>Like one of his, an <hi>Ulyſſean</hi> Lie,</l>
                  <l>I vouch ev'n <hi>Diomede,</hi> who tho' his Friend,</l>
                  <l>Cannot that Act excuſe, much leſs defend:</l>

                  <l>And ſure enough he heard, but durſt not hear.</l>
                  <l>The Gods with equal Eyes on Mortals look,</l>
                  <l>He juſtly was forſaken, who forſook:</l>
                  <l>Wanted that Succour he refus'd to lend,</l>

                  <l>No wonder, if he roar'd that all might hear;</l>
                  <l>His Elocution was increas'd by Fear:</l>

                     <pb n="439" facs="tcp:0986500100:479"/>
I heard, I ran, I found him out of Breath,</l>
                  <l>Pale, trembling, and half dead with fear of Death.</l>
                  <l>Though he had judg'd himſelf by his own Laws,</l>
                  <l>And ſtood condemn'd, I help'd the common Cauſe:</l>
                  <l>With my broad Buckler hid him from the Foe;</l>
                  <l>(Ev'n the Shield trembled as he lay below;)</l>
                  <l>And from impending Fate the Coward freed:</l>

                  <l>If ſtill he will perſiſt, and urge the Strife,</l>

                  <l>Let him return to that opprobrious Field;</l>
                  <l>Again creep under my protecting Shield:</l>
                  <l>Let him lie wounded, let the Foe be near,</l>
                  <l>And let his quiv'ring Heart confeſs his Fear;</l>
                  <l>There put him in the very Jaws of Fate;</l>
                  <l>And let him plead his Cauſe in that Eſtate:</l>

                  <l>My lifted Shield I loos'd, and let him go;</l>
                  <l>Good Heav'ns, how light he roſe, with what a bound</l>
                  <l>He ſprung from Earth, forgetful of his Wound;</l>
                  <l>How freſh, how eager then his Feet to ply;</l>

Your Vows were heard; we fought, and neither yield;</l>

                  <l>In that black Hour, that ſav'd you from the Sword?</l>
                  <l>Or was my Breaſt expos'd alone, to brave</l>

                  <l>For a ſav'd Fleet, leſs than a ſingle Shield?</l>
                  <l>Think it no Boaſt, O <hi>Grecians,</hi> if I deem</l>
                  <l>Theſe Arms want <hi>Ajax,</hi> more than <hi>Ajax</hi> them;</l>

                  <l>Will he compare my Courage with his Sleight?</l>
                  <l>As well he may compare the Day with Night.</l>
                  <l>Night is indeed the Province of his Reign:</l>

                  <l>The glitt'ring Helm by Moonlight will proclaim</l>

The firſt Encounter's paſt, the Foe repell'd,</l>

                  <l>Was all that Love could make a Lover be.</l>
                  <l>The Gods our Minds in mutual Bands did join;</l>
                  <l>I was his only Joy, and he was mine.</l>
                  <l>Now ſixteen Summers the ſweet Youth had ſeen;</l>
                  <l>And doubtful Down began to ſhade his Chin:</l>

                  <l>And lov'd me fiercely, as I lov'd the Boy.</l>

Th' inhuman Hoſt, who made his bloody Feaſts</l>
                  <l>On mangl'd Members of his butcher'd Gueſts,</l>
                  <l>Yet felt the force of Love, and fierce Deſire,</l>
                  <l>And burnt for me, with unrelenting Fire.</l>

                  <l>And comb'd, with Teeth of Rakes, his rugged Hair.</l>
                  <l>Now with a crooked Scythe his Beard he ſleeks;</l>
                  <l>And mowes the ſtubborn Stubble of his Cheeks:</l>

                  <l>What feels the Body when the Soul expires,</l>
                  <l>By Time corrupted, or conſum'd by Fires?</l>
                  <l>Nor dies the Spirit, but new Life repeats</l>
                  <l>In other Forms, and only changes Seats.</l>
                  <l>Ev'n I, who theſe myſterious Truths declare,</l>

                  <l>To ſeek her Fortune in ſome other Place.</l>

                  <l>This let me further add, That Nature knows</l>
                  <l>No ſtedfaſt Station, but, or Ebbs, or Flows:</l>
                  <l>Ever in Motion; ſhe deſtroys her old,</l>
                  <l>And caſts new Figures in another Mold.</l>
                  <l>Ev'n Times are in perpetual Flux, and run,</l>
                  <l>Like Rivers from their Fountain, rowling on.</l>
                  <l>For Time, no more than Streams, is at a Stay;</l>
                  <l>The flying Hour is ever on her Way:</l>

Thus in ſucceſſive Courſe the Minutes run,</l>
                  <l>And urge their Predeceſſor Minutes on,</l>
                  <l>Still moving, ever new: For former Things</l>

                  <l>And ſinks, a heavy lump of Earth, below.</l>
                  <l>Thus are their Figures never at a ſtand,</l>
