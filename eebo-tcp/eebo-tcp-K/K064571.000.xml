            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Some of the inferior <hi>Clergy,</hi> whom
I deſpiſe for their Ignorance and
Malice, have before in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
repreſented me as an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious</hi>
and <hi>blaſphemous Infidel</hi>; and I
have met with Affronts for it: But
I never imagin'd that any, much leſs
your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> would have ventur'd
ſuch a Character of me from the
<hi>Preſs,</hi> for fear of a Reſentment,
which would not be agreeable. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> has not read my
<hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> but has taken a Report
of them upon Truſt, from ſome
Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Noodle</hi>; or you could
never have been ſo much miſtaken
about my Deſign in them.</p>
            <p>I took myſelf to be a Chriſtian
of the ſame Faith with the Fathers
of the Church; and, without Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
think, I have publiſh'd ſome
Tracts, in Defence of Chriſtianity,
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:1207700300:4"/>
equal, if not ſuperior to any Thing
this Age has produced. I repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
alſo in my <hi>Diſcourſes on Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
to obviate the Prejudices of an
ignorant <hi>Clergy,</hi> made ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
of the Sincerity of my
Deſign, not to do Service to Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
but to make Way for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Meſſiahſhip
from Prophecy: But all theſe Aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the Integrity of my Heart,
it ſeems, ſtand for nothing (and I
don't wonder at it) with the <hi>Clergy,</hi>
who in their Principles, their Oaths,
and Subſcriptions are ſo accuſtom'd
to prevaricate with God and Man.
I ſhall make no more ſerious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations,
of my Faith, but expect
your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> ſhould ſoon publiſh a
Defence of your foul Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

Skill you have in the impious and
blaſphemous Writings of an Infidel.</p>
            <p>And if your <hi>railing Accuſation</hi> be

your <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>ſlanderous</hi> Sermon;
and appeal to the worſhipful <hi>Societies</hi>
for Reformation of Manners, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not juſt and reaſonable,

            <p>Now I have laid hold of your
<hi>Lordſhip,</hi> than whom I could not have
wiſh'd for an <hi>Adverſary,</hi> that will
do me more Honour to overcome,
I will hold you faſt; and you
muſt expect to be teaz'd and inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the <hi>Preſs,</hi> if you enter
not the Liſts againſt me.</p>
            <p>A clear Stage, <hi>my Lord,</hi> and no
Favour. If you have the Sword of
the Spirit in your Hand, cut as
ſharply as you can with it. I had
conceiv'd a great Opinion of your

if you had not in your Sermon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd

            <p>The ſooner your Lordſhip appears
from the <hi>Preſs,</hi> the better, in as
much as you may poſſibly prevent
my Publication of more <hi>Diſcourſes</hi>
of this Kind. And that it may not
be long firſt, I will accept of a
Diſſertation from you, on any two
or three of the Miracles, I have
handled, as ſufficient for all. Take
your Choice of them: but don't I
beſeech you, touch the Miracle of
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s driving the <hi>Buyers</hi> and <hi>Sellers</hi>
out of the Temple, becauſe it is
a <hi>hot</hi> one, and may poſſibly burn

are the two of this preſent
Diſcourſe. If you pleaſe, <hi>my Lord,</hi>
let them be the eaſy and ſhort
Task impoſed on you. If you

DISCOURSE
On The
MIRACLES
OF OUR
<hi>SAVIOUR,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y two former Diſcourſes
having met with a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Reception, I am encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
to go on and publiſh
another; which, without any
more Preface, I enter upon,
by a Repetition of the three general
Heads, at firſt propoſed to be ſpoken to,
and they were,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1207700300:9"/>
I. To ſhow that the Miracles of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Manner of bodily Diſeaſes, which
<hi>Jeſus</hi> was juſtly famed for, are none of the
proper Miracles of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> neither are
they ſo much as a good Proof of his divine
Authority to found a Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To prove, that the literal Hiſtory of
many of the Miracles of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> does imply Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
Improbabilities, and Incredibilities;
conſequently they, either in whole or in
part, were never wrought, as they are
commonly believed now-a-days, but are
only related as prophetical and parabolical
Narratives of what would be myſteriouſly
and more wonderfully done by him.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To conſider, what <hi>Jeſus</hi> means,
when he appeals to his Miracles, as to
a Teſtimony and a Witneſs of his divine
Authority; and to ſhow that he could not
properly and ultimately refer to thoſe he
then wrought in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but to thoſe
Myſtical ones, that he would do in the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> of which thoſe wrought in the Fleſh
are but meer Types and Shadows.</p>
            <p>Tho' I have already ſpoken, what may
be thought ſufficient, to the firſt of theſe
Heads; yet I have ſeveral Things ſtill, both
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1207700300:10"/>
from Reaſon and Authority, to add to it;
but having not here a convenient Place for
that Purpoſe, I defer it to a better Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity;
and ſo paſs immediately to the
Reſumption of my</p>
            <p>II. Second general Head, and that is, to
prove, that the literal Hiſtory of many of
the Miracles of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as recorded by the
<hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> does imply Abſurdities, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probabilities
and Incredibilities; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
they, either in whole or in part
were never wrought, as it is commonly
believed now-a days, but are only related,
as prophetical and parabolical Narratives
of what would be myſteriouſly and more
wonderfully done by him.</p>
            <p>To this Purpoſe I have taken into Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
ſix of the Miracles of <hi>Jeſus, viz.</hi>
thoſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of his driving the Buyers and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
out of the Temple.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of his exorciſing the <hi>Devils</hi> out of
the Mad-men, and ſending them into
the Herd of Swine.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of his Transfiguration on the Mount.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Of his healing a Woman, that had an
Iſſue of Blood, twelve Years.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Of his curing a Woman, that had a
Spirit of Infirmity, eighteen Years, and</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1207700300:11"/>
6. Of his telling the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman
her Fortune of having had five Husbands,
and being then an Adultereſs with another
Man.</p>
            <p>Whether I have not prov'd the Storys
of theſe Miracles, either in whole or in
part, to conſiſt of Abſurdities, Improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
and Incredibilities, according to
the Propoſition before us, I leave my <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
to judge; and now will take in Hand</p>
            <p n="7">7. A Seventh Miracle of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; <hi>viz.</hi>
that <note n="1" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> Chap. xxi. <hi>Mark,</hi> Chap. xi.</note> 
               <hi>of his curſing the Figtree, for not
bearing Fruit out of Seaſon</hi>; which Miracle,
upon the bare mention of it, appears to be
ſuch an abſurd, fooliſh, and ridiculous, if
not malicious and ill-natured Act in <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
that I queſtion, whether, for Folly and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity,
it can be equalled in any Inſtance
of the Life of a reputed wiſe Man. The
Fathers, ſuch as <hi>Origen,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> St.
<hi>John of Jeruſalem,</hi> and others, have all ſaid
as ſmart Things, as the wittyeſt Infidels
can, againſt the Letter of this Story. St.
<hi>Auguſtin</hi> 
               <note n="2" place="bottom">Hoc factum, niſi figuratum, ſtultum invenitur. <hi>In Serm.</hi> lxxvii.</note> very plainly ſays, that <hi>this
Fact in Jeſus,</hi> upon Suppoſition that it was
done, was <hi>a fooliſh one.</hi> If therefore I treat
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1207700300:12"/>
this Story a little more ludicrouſly than
ordinary, and expoſe the Folly of the Fact
as well as of the modern Belief of it, I hope
their Authority and Example will plead
my Excuſe for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeſus</hi> was hungary, it ſeems, and being
diſappointed of Figs, to the Satisfaction of
his Appetite, curſed the Figtree. Why ſo
peeviſh and impatient? Our <hi>Divines,</hi>
when they pleaſe, make <hi>Jeſus</hi> the moſt
patient, reſign'd and eaſy under Sufferings,
Troubles and Diſappointments, of any
Man. If he really was ſo, he could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have been ſo much out of Humour, for
want of a few Figs, to the Allay of his
Hunger. But to curſe the Figtree upon it,
was as fooliſhly and paſſionately done,
as for another Man to throw the Chairs
and Stools about the Houſe; becauſe his
Dinner is not ready at a critical Time, or
before it could be got ready for him.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Jeſus</hi> was hungry, ſome will ſay,
and the Diſappointment provoked him.
What if he was hungry? He ſhould, as
he knew the Return of his Appetite,
have made a better and more certain
Proviſion for it. Where was <hi>Judas</hi> his
Steward and Caterer with his Bag of
Victuals as well as Money? Poor Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1207700300:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Management amongſt them, or
<hi>Jeſus</hi> had nevet truſted to the uncertain
Fruits of a Figtree, which he eſpy'd at a
Diſtance, for his Breakfaſt.</p>
            <p>And if <hi>Jeſus</hi> was fruſtrated of a long'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
Meal of Figs, what need he have ſo
reveng'd the Diſappointment on the <note n="3" place="bottom">Nulla eſſet Ligni Culpa, quia Lignum ſine ſenſu non habebat Culpam. Auguſtin <hi>in Serm.</hi> lxxxix.</note> 
ſenſleſs and faultleſs Tree? Was it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was forc'd to faſt longer than uſual
and expedient? not ſo, I hope neither:
Could not Angels, if he was in a deſert
Place, have adminiſtred unto him? Or
could not he miraculouſly have created
Bread for himſelf and his Company, as
he multiplied or increaſed the Loaves for
his Thouſands in the Wilderneſs? What
Occaſion then for his being out of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
for want of Food? If he was of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to provide Bread for others on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
he might ſure have ſupply'd his own
Neceſſities, and ſo have kept his Temper,
without breaking into a violent Fit of Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
upon preſent Want and Diſappointment.</p>
            <p>But what is yet worſe, <hi>the Time of
Figs was not yet,</hi> when Jeſus look'd and
long'd for them. Did ever any one here
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1207700300:14"/>
or read of any Thing more <note n="4" place="bottom">Quaerit poma; neceſciebat tempus nondum eſſe? quod Cultor Arboris ſciebat. Creator Arboris neſciebat? <hi>Auguſtini in Serm.</hi> lxxxix.</note> unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than for a Man to expect Fruit out of
Seaſon? <hi>Jeſus</hi> could not but know this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he came to the Tree, and if he had
had any Conſideration, he would not have
expected Figs on it, much leſs, if he had
regarded his own Reputation, as a wiſe
Man, would he have ſo reſented the
Want of them. What, if a <hi>Yeoman</hi> of <hi>Kent</hi>
ſhould go to look for <hi>Pipins</hi> in his Orchard
at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> (the ſuppoſed Time <note n="5" place="bottom">Hoc ideo probamus, quia Paſſionis Domini Dies propinquabat, et ſcimus quo tempore paſſus ſit. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> that
<hi>Jeſus</hi> ſought for theſe Figs) and, becauſe
of a Diſappointment, cut down all his
Trees? What then would his Neighbours
make of him? Nothing leſs, than a <hi>Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Stock</hi>;
and if the Story got into our
publick News, he would be the Jeſt and
Ridicule of Mankind. How <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſalv'd
his Credit upon this his wild Prank;
and prevented the Laughter of the <hi>Scribes</hi>
and <hi>Phariſees</hi> upon it, I know not; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think of this Part of the Letter of this
Story, without ſmiling at it at this Day;
and wonder our <hi>Divines</hi> are not laugh'd
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1207700300:15"/>
out of Countenance for reading it gravely,
and having <hi>Jeſus</hi> in Admiration for it.</p>
            <p>Again, I would gladly know, whoſe Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree
this was, and whether <hi>Jeſus</hi> had any
legal Right to the Fruit, if haply he had
found any on it, or any Leave or Authority
to ſmite it with a Curſe for its Unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
As to the Tree's being <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
that could not be. For he was ſo
far from being either Landlord or Tenant,
that it's ſaid he had not where to lay his
Head. During the Time of his Miniſtry,
he was but a Wanderer, like a Mendicant
Fryar, or an itenerant Preacher, and before
that Time was no better than a Journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Carpenter (of whoſe Workmanſhip, I
wonder, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has no holy
Relicks, not ſo much as a Three-footed-ſtool,
or a Pair of Nutcrackers;) conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
he had no Houſe nor Land of his
own by Law, much leſs any Figtree, and
leaſt of all <hi>this</hi> which he eſpy'd at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in his Travels. How then had he
any Right to the Figs, if he had met with
any? I hope he ask'd Leave beforehand of
the Proprietor, or <hi>Infidels</hi> will ſay of him,
that if he had had an Opportunity he
would have been a <hi>Rob-Orchard.</hi> And if
he had no Right to the Fruit, much leſs to
ſmite the Tree with a Curſe; where was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1207700300:16"/>
his Honour, <note n="6" place="bottom">Arbor non eſt juſté ſiccata. <hi>Johan Hieroſol in Loc. Marci.</hi>
               </note> his Juſtice, his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and his Honeſty in this Act? The <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts,</hi>
if they would have us to think,
<hi>Jeſus</hi> did no wrong to any Man, ſhould
have left us ſomewhat upon Record, to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
in this Caſe; or <hi>Infidels,</hi> who
have here Scope for it, will think worſe
of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> than poſſibly he may deſerve.
Whether <hi>Jeſus,</hi> modeſtly ſpeaking, met
with any Blame or Reprimand from the
Proprietor, for his Act of Execration, none
can affirm or deny. But if any one ſo
ſpitefully and maliciouſly ſhould deſtroy
almoſt any other Tree, whether fruitful
or not, of another Man's, in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
he would have good Luck, if he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped
the Houſe of Correction for it.</p>
            <p>And what now have our <hi>Divines</hi> to ſay,
to all this Reaſoning againſt the Letter of
this Story? Nothing more than "That
the Act of curſing the Figtree, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be at this Diſtance of Time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
to Reaſon, Juſtice and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or not, was a ſupernatural Work,
above the Power of Nature or Art to
imitate, conſequently it was a Miracle,
and they will admire and adore <hi>Jeſus</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1207700300:17"/>
for it." And to agree with them at
preſent, that it was a real Miracle, and
a ſupernatural Event, yet I hope, they'll
acknowledge, that if <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi>
               <note n="7" place="bottom">Si miraculum fuerat tantummodo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandum, et non alquid prophetice figurandum, multo clementiùs dominus et ſua miſericordia dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niùs fecerat, Si quam aridam invenerit, viridem red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deret, ſicut languentes ſanavit.

Figtree, made a dry, dead and withered
one, immediately to bud, flouriſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive,
and in an Inſtant to bring forth
ripe Fruits, out of Seaſon, it would have
pleaſed them much better. Such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of his Power had been an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable
Miracle: Such an Inſtance of his
divine Power had carry'd Goodneſs along
with it, and none of the foreſaid Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
could have been made to it: Such
an Inſtance of his Almighty Power, had
been a Demonſtration of his being Lord
of the Creation, and Author of the Fruits
of the Earth for the Uſe of Man, in
their Seaſon, or he could not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
them out of Seaſon. In ſuch
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1207700300:18"/>
an Inſtance of Power, his divine Care
and Providence againſt Hunger and Want
would have been viſible; and it would
have been an Admonition to us, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
daily upon him for the Comforts
and Neceſſaries of Life: Such an Inſtance
of his Power would have been, as St.
<hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays above, like his Miracles of
healing Diſeaſes, of making the Languid,
<hi>Sound</hi>; and the Feeble, <hi>Strong</hi>; and we
might more certainly have infer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d from
one with the other, that both were the
Operations of a good God. But this
Inſtance of his curſing the Figtree in this
Faſhion ſpoils the Credit, and ſullies the
Glory of his other Miracles. It is in its own
Nature of ſuch a malevolent Aſpect, that
its enough to make us ſuſpect the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his other Works, and to
queſtion whether there might not be ſome
latent Poyſon and diabolical Deſign under
the Colour of his fairer Pretences to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Power. It is ſo like the malignant
Practices of <hi>Witches,</hi> who, as Stories go,
upon Envy, Grudge, or Diſtaſte, ſmite
their Neighbours Cattle with languiſhing
Diſtempers, till they die, that it's hard,
if not impoſſible, to diſtinguiſh one from
the other in Spite and Malice. If <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
and not <hi>Jeſus,</hi> had been the Author
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1207700300:19"/>
of this Miracle, our <hi>Divines</hi> would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
have diſcover'd the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Foot
in it, and have ſaid that <hi>Satan</hi> drew him
into a Scrape, in the Execution of this
mad and fooliſh Frolick, on purpoſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<hi>him</hi> for a <hi>Wizard</hi> and <hi>his</hi> Muſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of all Ages ſince for Fools in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
on him. The Spirit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
who is all Love and Mercy, ſhould, one
Would think, breath forth nothing but
Goodneſs and Kindneſs to Mankind; but
that ſuch a peſtilential Blaſt, like a morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous
North-Eaſt Wind in ſome Seaſons,
ſhould proceed from his Mouth, to the
Deſtruction of another Man's harmleſs and
inoſſenſive Tree, is what none upon Earth
can account for.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Divines,</hi> one or other of them,
have publiſh'd ſeveral notable Notions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Miracles, and have laid down good
Rules to diſtinguiſh <hi>true</hi> from <hi>falſe</hi> ones;
but none of them, as far as I perceive,
have taken any Pains to ſhew the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Miracles to their own
Rules and Notions. Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi>(who

ſtated the Notion of a Miracle) among
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1207700300:20"/>
his Rules of judging by whom Miracles
are perform'd, ſays, <note n="9" place="bottom">Vindication of the Chriſtian Religion, p. 82</note> 
               <hi>That the Things

to intereſt himſelf in</hi>; and again, <hi>they muſt
be ſuch as anſwer to the Character of God

<hi>It ſeems reaſonable to believe, that whenever

an extraordinary Meſſenger with a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Will, he will furniſh him with
ſuch Proofs of his Miſſion, as may argue
not only the Power of him in whoſe Name
he comes, but his Love to Mankind, and his
Inclination to do them good.</hi> I have no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to theſe Notions of Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>;
but as it is not to be queſtioned, that he
(and the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> too) had this Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s curſing the Figtree, and
ſome others, as of <hi>his boiſterous driving

of <hi>his ſending the Devils into the Herd
of Swine</hi>; of <hi>his turning Water into Wine
for the Uſe of Men, who had before well
drank,</hi> &amp;c. in his View, when he gave
forth the foreſaid Rules; for acute and
learned Writers in Theology are ſuppoſed
to have their Wits about them; ſo it is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1207700300:21"/>
to be hop'd that he or the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> will
ſoon publiſh ſomewhat to reconcile theſe
Miracles of <hi>Jeſus</hi> to their own Notions;
tho' I don't expect it before <hi>latter Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all, it may be queſtioned, if
Infidels ſhould go about it, whether this
Work of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was miraculous; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there was not more of the Craft of
Man, than of the Power of God in it;
or to uſe Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s <note n="10" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> Words,

and cunning Deceits of Impoſtors.</hi> St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
ſays, <hi>preſently the Figtree withered

Time, and may be underſtood of a
Day, or a Week or two, as well as of the
Moment in which the Words were ſpoken;
<hi>Let no Fruit grow on thee henceforward for
ever.</hi> St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſays, <hi>that in the Morning
as the Diſciples paſſed by, they ſaw the
Figtree dry'd up from the Roots,</hi> which
was at leaſt the Day <note n="11" place="bottom">Quod ſequenti die viderint exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruiſſe ficum. <hi>Theophylact. in Locum Marci.</hi>
               </note> after the Curſe
was utter'd, ſo that there was certainly
four and twenty Hours for its withering;
and if it is ſaid that the <hi>Tree dry'd up from
the Roots,</hi> it does not imply that the
Trunk of it periſh'd or was reduc'd to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1207700300:22"/>
nothing; but only that the green Leaves
of the Whole, and of every Part of it,
were in a withering Condition: And might
not all this be done without a Miracle?
What if <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> ſhould ſay, that
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> being minded to impoſe on his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Followers, took a ſecret Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
beforehand to lay his Capen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
Ax to the Root of this Tree, and ſo
imperceptibly circumciſed it, as that the
Leaves did, what they will do, wither in
a Night and a Day's Time. God forbid,
that I ſhould think, <hi>Jeſus</hi> did ſo; but as
to the Poſſibility of ſuch a Fraud in an
Impoſtor, none can doubt of it.</p>
            <p>I am ſo far from thinking there was any
ſuch Fraud in this ſuppoſed Miracle of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
that I don't believe it was at all done
by him according to the Letter: And for
this I have not only a clear and intrinſick
Proof from the Story itſelf; but the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Fathers. St <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> treating on
the Parable of the Figtree in <note n="12" place="bottom">Chap. xiii.</note> St.
<hi>Luke,</hi> intimates, that what St. <hi>Matthew</hi>
and St. <hi>Mark</hi> write of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s curſing the
Figtree, is but <note n="13" place="bottom">Quid ſibi vult, quod in Evangelio ſuo Dominus Fici Parabolam <hi>frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> inducit: Habes enim alibi, quod juſſu Domini Viriditas omnis hujus Ligni frondentis aurerit. <hi>In Loc. Lucae.</hi>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1207700300:23"/>
And St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> 
               <note n="14" place="bottom">Vidiamus, ubi alibi ſcriptum de iſt a ficu; in Evangelio ſecundum Lucam legimus, &amp;c. <hi>In Loc. Marci. Hom.</hi> xii.</note> 
ſays expreſsly enough, that the three <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts</hi>
write of one and the ſame Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,
conſequently parabolically, and that,
what St <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi> write of
it, was no more a literal Tranſaction, than
the Parable in St. <hi>Luke.</hi> Thanks to theſe
holy Fathers for their ridding us of the
Belief of the Letter of this Story, which
otherwiſe might have perplex'd us with its
Abſurdities before urg'd. And to their
Opinion I deſire it may be added and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
whether it be not as reaſonable
in itſelf to take what the three <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi>
write of this Figtree, as Part of one
Story, as well as, what they write of the
<hi>Woman with her Iſſue of Blood,</hi> and of
<hi>Jeſus's caſting the Devils out of the Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and of other Miracles which are but
ſeveral Relations of the ſame Story, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or Miracle. Neither is it any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for a literal Tranſaction of this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
that, the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> ſpeak of it, as a
Thing done: For, as <hi>Origen</hi> ſays, there are
ſome Things ſpoken of in the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi>
as Facts, which were never tranſacted; ſo
it is of the Nature of Prophecy (and our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1207700300:24"/>
Saviour in his whole Life propheſied) to
ſpeak of Things to come, as if they were
already paſt; becauſe ſuch Prophecies are
not to be underſtood till after their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment,
and then the Reaſon of
the Uſe of the <hi>praeter,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
Tenſe, in Prophecy, will be viſible.
But what, in my Opinion, is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Demonſtration, that there's no Truth
in the Letter of this Story, is, what our
Saviour adds, upon the Diſciples wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the ſudden withering of the Figtree,
ſaying, <note n="15" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> Chap. xxi. 21.</note> 
               <hi>that if they had Faith,</hi>
               <hi>they ſhould not only do what was done to the
Figtree</hi>; <hi>but ſhould ſay to this Mountain,</hi>
(that was near him, I ſuppoſe) <hi>be thou
removed and caſt into the Sea, and it ſhall
be done.</hi> But theſe Things were never lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
done by them, conſequently <hi>Jeſus</hi>
himſelf did not litterally curſe the Figtree;
or the Diſciples wanted Faith for the
doing the ſaid Miracles, which is an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity
to ſuppoſe; or <hi>Jeſus</hi> talked idly
of a Promiſe to inveſt them with a Power.
they were never to be poſſeſs'd of. But of
what ill Conſequence to Religion, either
of theſe Suppoſitions is, let the old Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1207700300:25"/>

that Works of <hi>Jeſus</hi> are all figurative

who would queſtion, that this ſuppoſed
Fact of <hi>Jeſus</hi> had a myſtical Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
yet if he had liv'd in our Days, he
would have met with <hi>Divines,</hi> who, for all
the foreſaid Abſurdities and their Cogen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to drive us to Allegory, do adhere to
the Letter only, whether the Truth, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility

or not. But then to do Juſtice to
St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Aſſertion, he would have
met with others, who <hi>againſt their Wills,</hi>
interpret this Miracle figuratively, ſuch
as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and Dr. <hi>Whitby,</hi> who
ſay, <hi>Jeſus</hi> curſed the Figtree by way of
Type of the Deſtruction of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
State, which declined and waſted away
after the Similitude of this withering Tree.
But why then don't theſe <hi>Commentators</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorically
interpret and apply other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of our Saviour? Becauſe they think
the Letter will ſtand good and abide the
Teſt without an Allegory. And why do they
allegoriſe this Miracle only? Becauſe of
the Dificulties and Abſurdities of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which they can't account for. And
are theſe Reaſons good? No, certainly:
The <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> ſhould have made the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
for them. They ſhould have told
us, which Miracles are to be allegoris'd
and myſtically applied, and which are not;
or we are to allegoriſe all or none at all.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1207700300:27"/>
how came theſe modern Allegoriſts of this
Miracle to apply it as they do, and to
make it a myſtical Repreſentation of the
Ruin of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State? Did they take
up this Notion of their own Heads, or did
they borrow it of the Fathers? Why in all
Probability they took the Hint from the
Fathers; wherefore then don't they, what
none of them do, cite and acknowledge
their Authors for it? Becauſe, like Men

have oblig'd them, upon their Authority,
to allegoriſe the reſt of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Miracles,
in the way that I have interpreted ſome of
them; but this would not have agreed with
their Stomachs for many Reaſons. No
Thanks then to the aforſaid <hi>Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
for their allegorical Application of this
Miracle, which they are again to deſert,
or abide the Conſequence of allegoriſing
others alſo, which for their Intereſts and

I paſs to the Conſideration of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

            <p>Who or what is meant by the Figtree
ſeems not to be agreed among the Fathers;
or, more properly ſpeaking, they are not
agreed, all of them to apply it always to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1207700300:29"/>
one and the ſame Thing. Some, as <note n="20" place="bottom">Quid Arbor fici, niſi humanam naturam deſignet? <hi>In Homil.</hi> xxxi.</note> 
               <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> ſay Human Nature

               </note> St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> ſay the

               <hi>Origen</hi> ſay, it is a Type
of the Church of Chriſt. So do the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſeem to be divided in their Opinions;
but it is without any Difference or Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency
with each other. For as there is,
according to the Fathers, Myſtery upon

I believe the Figtree here, as a Type, may
be properly enough apply'd to the foreſaid
three Purpoſes. And if the Fathers had
been ask'd their Opinion in this Caſe, I
dare ſay, they would have ſaid ſo too.
This is certain that <hi>Origen</hi>

a Ceſſation of its Unfruitful State, which
then will wither away, and be turn'd into a

the <hi>Jews</hi>; at the End of which, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Paſſion and Reſurrection, the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> State, like the Figtree, withered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and, for its Unfruitfulneſs, was root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up. They that underſtand the Figtree
as a Figure of the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by
the <hi>three Years,</hi> mean the apocalyptical
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1207700300:31"/>
               <hi>twelve hundred and ſixty Days</hi> (that is,

at the Concluſion of which, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſay <hi>Jeſus</hi> will come again to his

            <p>Some perhaps may be ready here to
interpoſe with a Queſtion, and ſay, how
will <hi>Jeſus</hi> then come to his Church? I
have carefully peruſed the Fathers upon

Teſtimonies and Arguments to either of

But if our <hi>Divines</hi> ſhould think I have
put a falſe Gloſs on the Text of St. <hi>Jude</hi>
above, I have a Bundle of Arguments and
Teſtimonies to produce in Defence of it,
at their Service.</p>
            <p>In the Parable of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> it is ſaid,
<hi>Lo, theſe three Years come I ſeeking Fruit on

ſucceſſively for <hi>three Years</hi> together; but
according to the Original, it ought to be

read, <hi>Lo, it is three Years and 1 now come,</hi>
or <hi>Lo, the three Years are now paſt, and I

whether we underſtand the Figtree, as a
Figure of the Church in particular, or of
Mankind in general; the myſtical Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>three Years</hi> will terminate about
the ſame Time, againſt the Evangelical
Sabbath, on which the Unfruitfulneſs of
the Church, or of Mandind, according to
the Fathers, is to have an End put to it.</p>

So <hi>Jeſus,</hi> when he comes to his Church,
will find nothing in her but Leaves only.
And what is here meant by Leaves? Let

earneſtly deſire, like a Man that is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
the Fruits of the Spirit in his Church,
which will be as grateful to him as Figs
can be to a Man naturally. To underſtand
this Expreſſion of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s <hi>Hunger</hi> literally, is
ſuch a mean Circumſtance of Life, that
unleſs it be, what's next to impoſſible, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
introductory to ſome noble Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1207700300:35"/>
it's unfit to be remember'd of a
Saint in Hiſtory. <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> would
have diſdain'd to mention ſuch a frivolous
Circumſtance in the Life of a Philoſopher
as <hi>this</hi> of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> But if we underſtand
this <hi>Hunger</hi> in <hi>Jeſus</hi> myſtically, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively
of his Deſires of the Fruits of
the Spirit in his Church, it is ſublime
and noble; and the Emblem confeſſedly
proper and instructive.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Jeſus</hi> is ſaid to come to the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree
at an unſeaſonable Time; <hi>For the

has been the Perplexity of <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators,</hi>
who with all their Wit and Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
can't get well over it. I ſhall not
mention here all or any of their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Solutions of this Difficulty; but let us
ſee whether we can't eaſily and at once
unloſe it. St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Words are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which are and have been
commonly tranſlated, <hi>for the Time of Figs
is not yet.</hi> But if we change the <hi>Point</hi>
into an <hi>Interrogation,</hi> and read thus, <hi>for
was it not the Time of Figs?</hi> the Difficulty
vaniſhes as certainly, as that it is abſurd
to ſuppoſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould come to his Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree
and look for Fruit, when he could
not reaſonably expect any. This my So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of this Difficulty certainly ſerves
the Purpoſe of the myſtical Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1207700300:36"/>
and if it does not the litteral, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
we are not to heed the Letter, which
ſeldom or never has any Senſe or Truth
in it. But, by the by, it does the litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
too, ſince there are no Grounds from
the Text to think, what has been the
common Opinion, that it was about the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Paſſover that <hi>Jeſus</hi> came to the
Figtree. If this my Solution of the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
don't pleaſe, I muſt ſay with <note n="32" place="bottom">Ad quem (Locum) intelligendum, ut opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet, expectandum eſſe Eliae, ut nonnu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

off this myſtical Figtree, and preſent them
to the intellectual Taſte of Mankind.
But, that my Solution is good, will appear
by what follows.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Jeſus</hi> finding Leaves only ſays,
in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> to the Figtree, <hi>Let no
Fruit grow on thee henceforward for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>;
which (with its parallel Place in St.
<hi>Mark</hi>) is in my Opinion a falſe Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
The Original is, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and ought to be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1207700300:37"/>
engliſhed, <hi>not as yet,</hi> or <hi>not untill now,</hi>
(that I came) <hi>againſt the</hi> (grand) <hi>Age</hi> (of
the Sabbath) has Fruit grown on thee. So
that the Miracle of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was to make
the Figtree of the Church fruitful; and
if her preceeding unfruitful State, which
(in St. <hi>Mark</hi>) <hi>Jeſus</hi> is ſaid to curſe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to devote to Ruin, waſted away, it
was by Conſequence.</p>
            <p>But what Time of Day was it that
<hi>Jeſus</hi> came to the Figtree? It was in the
<hi>Morning.</hi> And of what Day? That is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
as to the Letter, but according to
the myſtical Extent of the <hi>Three Years,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we underſtand the Figtree as a Type
of the Church, or of all Mankind of all
Ages, it will be on the <hi>Morning</hi> of the
great Sabbath, when, upon the Appearance
of the Light of Chriſt, like the Riſing of
the Sun, an unfruitful and erroneous
Church muſt needs wither away. And
the Diſciples on the ſaid <hi>Morning</hi> will,
as <hi>Origen</hi> 
               <note n="34" place="bottom">Oculis Spiritalibus viderunt Myſterium fici ſiccatae. <hi>Matt. Tract.</hi> xvi.</note> ſays, with their intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Eyes behold her waſte with Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And then too, they under Chriſt
<hi>will do what is done to the Figtree,</hi> of the
Church, and <hi>remove Mountains</hi> of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
Power, that exalt themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1207700300:38"/>
him, as the Fathers interpret, and
I need not explain.</p>
            <p>And what is meant by the Means, which
St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks of, to make the Figtree
of the Church fruitful on the Sabbatical
Year; <hi>the Year it is to be let alone to
bear Fruit in?</hi> There muſt be <hi>digging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it,</hi> that is <note n="35" place="bottom">Effodientes Literam Legis. <hi>Cyril. Glaphyr.</hi> L. 1. P1.</note> into the Earth of the

of the ſame Thing with the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs</hi>
of the Figtree. And the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
of the Woman on the Sabbath is of

I can't but adore the Providence of
God, that the Miracle has been hitherto
placed in the withering away of the Tree.
If the Miracle had been a plain Story of
a dead and wither'd Tree's being made
to bring forth Leaves and Fruit on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
this would have been ſuch a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
ſupernatural Work, and ſo agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to modern Notioniſts about Miracles,
that Mens Thoughts would have been ſo
abſorpt in the Conſideration of the Letter,
as they would never have extended them
to the Contemplation of the Myſtery. And
our Divines would have made ſuch a Noiſe,
in our Ears of the Excellency and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſneſs
of ſuch a Miracle, as that
there would be no bearing of it. But
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1207700300:40"/>
But as the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> have in a good
Meaſure ſuppreſs'd all mention of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Fruitfulneſs of the Tree; and the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
by Miſconſtruction, is clog'd with the
foreſaid Difficulties and Abſurdities, we
are of Neceſſity driven to the ſearch after
Myſtery for good Senſe and Truth in it.</p>
            <p>And thus have I ſpoken enough to the
Miracle of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s curſing the Figtree,
which according to the Letter is a fooliſh
and abſurd Story: But the myſtical
Operation, of which the Letter is a
Shadow, will be raviſhing, marvelous
and ſtupendous; and not only a Proof
of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Power and Preſence in his
Church, but a Demonſtration of his <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahſhip,</hi>
in as much as an infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Prophecys upon Prophecys, will
thereupon be diſcern'd to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd,
or the Church can't bring forth
the Fruits of the Spirit, that is Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Interpretations of the Scriptures, like
ripe Figs. And ſo I paſs to an</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Eighth</hi> Miracle of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and that
is, <note n="38" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John,</hi> Chap. v.</note> "of his healing a Man of an
Infirmity, of thirty eight Years Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> that had
five Porches, in which lay a great Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of impotent Folk, blind, halt,
withered, waiting the troubling of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1207700300:41"/>
Waters, upon the Deſcent of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
who gave a Sanative Virtue to them,
to the curing of any one, be his Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of what kind ſoever, who firſt
ſtept down into them."</p>
            <p>This whole Story is what our Saviour
calls a <hi>Camel</hi> of a monſtrous Size for
Abſurdities, Improbabilities and Incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
which our <hi>Divines,</hi> and their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
Followers of theſe laſt Ages, have
ſwallowed without chewing; whilſt they
have been ſtraining at <hi>Knats</hi> in Theology,
and heſitating at frivolous and indifferent
Things of the Church, of no Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Miracle in this Story,
which conſiſted in his healing a Man, of
no body knows what <hi>Infirmity,</hi> there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is nor can be proved any Thing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
in it, or there had been an
expreſs Deſcription of the Diſeaſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which it is impoſſible to ſay, there
was a miraculous Cure wrought. As far as
one may reaſonably gueſs, this Man's <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity</hi>
was more <hi>Lazyneſs</hi> than <hi>Lameneſs,</hi>
and <hi>Jeſus</hi> only ſhamed him out of his
pretended Illneſs, by bidding him to take
up his Stool and walk off, and not lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
longer, like a lazy Lubbard and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler,
among the Diſeaſed, who were
real Objects of Pity and Compaſſion: Or,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1207700300:42"/>
if he was no Deſſembler, he was only
fancyfully ſick, and <hi>Jeſus</hi> by ſome proper
and ſeaſonable Talk touch'd his Heart, to
his Relief; and ſo, by the Help of his own
Imagination, he was cured, and went his
Way. This is the <hi>worſt</hi> that can be
made of this <hi>infirm</hi> Man's Caſe; and the
<hi>beſt</hi> that can be ſaid of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Power
in the Cure of him, as will appear, by and
by, upon Examination into it. But the
other Parts of the Story of the healing
Virtue of the Waters, upon the Deſcent
of an Angel into them, is not only void
of all good Foundation in Hiſtory, but
is a Contradiction to common Senſe and
Reaſon, as will be manifeſt after an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the Particulars of it.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>John</hi> was the beloved Diſciple of
our Lord, and I hope he lov'd his Maſter;
or he was worſe than an Heathen, who
loves thoſe who love him: But this Story,
and ſome others, that are peculiar to his
Goſpel, ſuch as, of <hi>Jeſus's telling the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan
Woman her Fortune</hi>; of <hi>his healing
the blind Man with Eye-Salve made of
Clay and Spittle</hi>; Of <hi>his turning Water
into Wine for the Uſe of Men, who had
before well drank</hi>; and of <hi>his raiſing La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus
from the Dead,</hi> are enough to tempt
us to think, that he wilfully deſign'd, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to blaſt the Reputation of his Maſter,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1207700300:43"/>
or to try how far the Credulity of Men,
who through blind Love were running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace
into Chriſtianity, might be impoſed
on; or he had never related ſuch idle Tales,
which, if the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> who ſhould be the
philoſophical Part of Mankind, had not
been amply hired into the Belief of them,
would certainly have been rejected with
Indignation and Scorn before now.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>John</hi> wrote his Goſpel many Years
after the other <hi>Evangeliſts</hi>: What then
ſhould have been his peculiar Buſineſs?
Certainly nothing more, than to add ſome
remarkable Paſſages of Life, to <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
which they had omitted; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the Truths which they had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
of him. But St. <hi>John</hi> is ſo far from
doing this, that the Stories, he has parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
added, are not only derogatory
to the Honour of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but ſpoil his
Fame for a Worker of Miracles, which
the other <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> would raiſe him to.
By reading the other <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> one
would think, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was a Healer of
all manner of Diſeaſes, however incurable
by Art and Nature, and that where-ever
he came, all the ſick and the maim'd
(excepting a few Infidels) were perfectly
cured by him. But this Story before us
will be like a Demonſtration, that <hi>Jeſus</hi>
was no ſuch Worker of Miracles and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1207700300:44"/>
Healer of Diſeaſes, as he is commonly
believed to have been, and that he wrought
not near the Number of Cures, he is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to have done, much leſs any great ones.
The beſt Conception that an impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Goſpel can form of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is, that
he was a tolerable good natural <hi>Orator,</hi> and
could handſomely harangue the People
off hand, and was according to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
of the Times a good <hi>Cabaliſt</hi>;
and his Admirers finding him endewed
with the Gift of Utterance, which was
thought by them more than human, they
fancy'd he muſt have the Gift of healing
too, and would have him to exerciſe it;
which he did with Succeſs, upon the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Imaginations of many, who mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
his divine Power for it. And the
Apoſtles afterwards, to help forward the
Credulity and Deluſion of the People,
amplified his Fame with extravagant Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions
and ſtrange Stories of Miracles,
paſſing the Belief of conſiderate and wiſe
Men. Whether this Repreſentation of the
Caſe, according to the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels,
be falſe and improbable, let my
<hi>Readers</hi> judge by the Story before us,
which I come now to diſſect, and make
a particular Examination into the ſeveral
Parts of it. Accordingly it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:1207700300:45"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> that this Story of the <hi>Pool</hi> of
<hi>Betheſda,</hi> abſtractedly conſidered from
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Cure of an infirm Man at it, has
no good Foundation in Hiſtory: It merits
no Man's Credit, nor will any reaſonable
Perſon give any heed to it. St. <hi>John</hi> is
the only Author that has made any
mention of this Story; and tho' his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
may be good, and better than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Man's in Relation to the Words
and Actions of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in as much as he
was moſt familiar and converſant with
him; yet, for foreign Matters, that have
no immediate Reſpect to <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Life, he's
no more to be regarded than another <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi>
who, if he palm upon his <hi>Readers</hi>
an improbable Tale of ſenſleſs and abſurd
Circumſtances, will have his Authority
queſtioned, and his Story pry'd into by
the Rules of <hi>Criticiſm,</hi> and rejected or
received as it is found worthy of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
and Credit. If there had been any
Truth in this Story before us, I cannot
think but <hi>Joſephus</hi> or ſome other <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Writers, it is ſo remarkable, peculiar and
aſtoniſhing an Inſtance of the Angelical
Care and Love to the diſtreſſed of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
would have ſpoken of it: But I don't
find they have; or our modern <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators</hi>
would have refer'd to them, as to
a Teſtimony of the Credibility of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1207700300:46"/>
Goſpel-Hiſtory. <hi>Joſephus</hi> has profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
written the Hiſtory of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Nation, in which he ſeems to omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that makes for the Honour of his
Country, or for the Manifeſtation of the
Providence of God over it. He tells us
of the Converſation of Angels with the
Patriarchs and Prophets, and intermixes
Extra-Scriptural Traditions, as he thought
them fit to be tranſmitted to Poſterity.
How came he then and all other <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Writers to forget this Story of the Pool
of <hi>Betheſda?</hi> I think, we may as well
ſuppoſe that a Writer of the natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> would neglect to
ſpeak of the medicinal Waters of <hi>Bath,</hi>
as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſhould omit that Story, which,
if true, was a ſingular Proof of God's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing
Care of his peculiar People,
or an Angel had never been frequently,
as we ſuppoſe, ſent to this Relief of the
Diſeaſed amongſt them. Is then St. <hi>John</hi>'s
ſingle Authority enough to convey this
Story down to us? Some may ſay, that
there are ſeveral Prodigies, as well as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Events of ancient Times, that, tho'
they are reported but by one Hiſtorian,
meet with Credit; and why may not St.
<hi>John</hi>'s Teſtimony be equal to another
Writer's? I grant it; and tho' it is hardly
probable but that this Story, if true, before
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1207700300:47"/>
us, muſt have had the Fortune to be told
by others; yet St. <hi>John</hi>'s ſingle Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſhall paſs ſooner than another Man's,
if the Matter be in itſelf credible and well
circumſtanc'd. But were it is blindly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly
and with monſtrouſly incredible
Circumſtances related, like this before us,
it ought to be rejected. Which brings me,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To ask, what was the true
Occaſion of the Angels Deſcent into this
Pool? Was it to waſh and bath himſelf?
Or, was it to impart an healing Quality
to the Waters for ſome one diſeaſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?
The Reaſon, that I ask the firſt of
theſe two Queſtions, is, becauſe ſome
ancient Readings of v. 4. ſay <note n="39" place="bottom">Vid, Milli. Nov. Teſt. <hi>In Loc.</hi>
               </note> the
Angel <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>was waſhed,</hi> which ſuppoſes
ſome bodily Defilement or Heat contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Caeleſtial Regions, that want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Refrigeration or Purgation in theſe
Waters: But how abſurd ſuch a Thought
is, needs no Proof. To impart then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionately
an healing Power to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
for the Benefit of the Diſeaſed was
the ſole Deſign of the Angel's Deſcent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them. And God forbid, that any ſhould
philoſophically debate the Matter, and
enquire how naturally the Waters deriv'd
that Virtue from the Angel's corporal
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1207700300:48"/>
Preſence. The Thing was providential
and miraculous, our <hi>Divines</hi> will ſay, and
ſo let it paſs. But I may fairly ask, why
one diſeaſed Perſon only at a Time reap'd
the Benefit? Or why the whole Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of impotent Folks were not at once
healed? I have a notable Anſwer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to be given to theſe Queſtions; but
I am afraid beforehand, our <hi>Divines</hi> will
not approve of it: Therefore they are to give
one of their own, and make the Matter
conſiſtent with the Goodneſs and Wiſdom
of God; or the ſaid Queſtions ſpoil the
Credit of the Story, and make an idle
and ridiculous Romance of it. And when
their Hands are in, to make, what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
a ſatisfactory Anſwer to the
ſaid Queſtions; I wiſh, that, for the ſake
of <hi>Orthodoxy,</hi> they would determine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Angel deſcended with his Head
or his Heels foremoſt, or whether he might
not come ſwauping upon his Breaſt into
the Waters, like a Gooſe into a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond.
But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How often in the Week, the
Month or the Year did the Angel
vouchſafe his Deſcent into the Pool?
And for how many Ages before <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s
Advent, and why not ſince and even <note n="40" place="bottom">Quare modo non movetur Aqua? St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſ. de Sacrament. Lib. C.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:1207700300:49"/>
               <hi>now,</hi> was this Gracious and Angelical Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
granted? St. <hi>John</hi> ſhould have been
particular as to theſe Points, which he could
not but know Philoſophers would be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to enquire about. If it was but once
in the Year, as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> 
               <note n="41" place="bottom">
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>In Serm. contra Eberictatem.</hi>
               </note> hints,
little Thanks are due to him for his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy.
One would think ſometimes, that
his Deſcent was frequent; or ſuch a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of impotent Folk, variouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd
had never attended on it. And
again at other Times, one would think
that his Deſcent was ſeldom, or the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed
as faſt as they came, which could
not be faſter than the Angel could dabble
himſelf in the Waters, had been charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
diſmiſſed with reſtor'd Health. Here
then is a Defect in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Story, and a
<hi>Block,</hi> at which wiſe and conſiderate Free-Thinkers
will ſtumble. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> How came it to paſs, that
there was not better Care taken, either
by the Providence of God, or of the
Civil Magiſtrates of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> about
the Diſpoſal of the Angelical Favour to
this or that poor Man, according to his
Neceſſities or Deſerts: But that he, who
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1207700300:50"/>
could fortunately catch the Favour, was
to have it. Juſt as he who runs faſteſt
obtains the Prize: So here the Diſeaſed,
who was moſt nimble and watchful of
the Angel's Deſcent, and could firſt plunge
himſelf into the Pool, carried off the Gift
of Sanation. An odd and a merry Way of
conferring a divine Mercy. And one would
think that the Angels of God did this
for their own Diverſion, more than to
do good to Mankind, Juſt as ſome
throw a Bone among a Kennel of Hounds,
for the Pleaſure of ſeeing them quarrel
for it; or as others caſt a Piece of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
among a Company of Boys for the
Sport of ſeeing them ſcramble for it: So
was the Paſtime of the Angels here. It
was the Opinion of ſome Heathens, that
<hi>Homines ſunt Luſus Deorum,</hi> the Gods
ſport themſelves with the Miſeries of
Mankind; but I never thought, before
I conſidered this Story, that the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
of the God of the <hi>Jews</hi> did ſo too.
But if they delighted in it, rare ſport
it was to them, as could be to a <hi>Town-Mobb.</hi>
For as the poor and diſtreſſed
Wretches were not to be ſuppoſed to
be of ſuch a polite Converſation, as in
Complaiſance to give place to their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or in Compaſſion to make way
for the moſt miſerable; but upon the Sight
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1207700300:51"/>
or Sound of the Angel's Fall into the Pool,
would without Reſpect of Perſons ſtrive who
ſhould be firſt: So thoſe who were behind
and unlikely to be cured, would like an
unciviliz'd <hi>Rabble,</hi> puſh and preſs all
before them into it. What a Number
then, of ſome hundreds perhaps, of poor
Creatures were at once tumbled into the
Waters to the Diverſion of the City Mob,
as well as of God's Angels? And if one
aroſe out of it, with the Cure of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
the reſt came forth like drown'd <hi>Rats,</hi>
to the Laughter of the foreſaid Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
and it was well if there was not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more Miſchief done, than the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>one</hi> could be of Advantage, to thoſe
People. Believe then this Part of the Story,
let him that can. If any Angel was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in this Work, it was an Angel of
<hi>Satan</hi> who delights in Miſchief; and if
he healed <hi>one</hi> upon ſuch an Occaſion, he
did it by way of Bait, to draw others
into Danger of Life and Limb. But as
our <hi>Divines</hi> will not, I ſuppoſe, bear the
Thoughts of it's being a bad Angel; ſo
I leave them to conſider upon our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,
whether it was credible that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a good or a bad Angel was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and deſire them to remember to give
me a better Reaſon, why but <hi>one</hi> at a
Time was healed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:1207700300:52"/>
If any Pool or Ciſtern of Water about
this City of <hi>London</hi> was ſo bleſſed with the
Deſcent of an Angel to ſuch an End, the
Magiſtrates, ſuch is their Wiſdom, would, if
God did not direct, take care of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Diſpoſal of the Mercy to the beſt
Advantage of the Diſeaſed. And if they
ſold it to an infirm <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>Merchant,</hi> who
could give for it moſt Money, to be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
among other Poor and diſtreſs'd Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
would it not be wiſely done of them?
To ſuppoſe they would leave the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Favour to the Struggle of a Multitude,
is abſurd and incredible. And why then
ſhould we think otherwiſe of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>? Away then with
the Letter of this Story! And if this be
not enough to confute it. Then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let us conſider, to its farther
Confutation, who and what were the
impotent Folk, that lay in the Porches of
<hi>Betheſda,</hi> waiting the Troubling of the
Waters. St. <hi>John</hi> ſays they were <hi>Blind,</hi>
               <hi>Halt, Withered,</hi> and as ſome Manuſcripts
 <note n="42" place="bottom">Vid. Milli. Nov. Teſt. <hi>In Loc.</hi>
               </note> have it, <hi>Paralyticks.</hi> And what did
any of theſe there? How could any of
them be ſuppoſed to be nimble enough of
Foot to ſtep down firſt into the Waters,
and carry off the Prize of Sanation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1207700300:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
many others of various Diſtempers?
Tho' the troubled Waters might be of
ſuch medicinal Force as to heal a Man of
whatſoever Diſeaſe he had; yet none of
the foreſaid Perſons for want of good Feet
and Eyes could expect the Benefit of it.
Tho' the Ears of the Blind might ſerve
him to hear, when the Angel plump't
like a Stone into the Waters, yet through
want of Sight for the guidance of his
Steps, he would by others be joſtled out
of the right Way down into them. And
if the Lame had good Eyes to diſcern the
the Deſcent of the Angel, yet Feet were
all in all to this Purpoſe: Conſequently
theſe impotent Folk, ſpecified by St. <hi>John,</hi>
might as well have ſlay'd at Home, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted
to <hi>Betheſda</hi> for Cure. I know not
what Fools the Diſeaſed of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of
old might be, but if there was ſuch a Prize
of Health to be ſtrove for, by the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
of this City, I appeal to all Men
of common Senſe, whether the <hi>Blind,</hi> the
<hi>Lame,</hi> the <hi>withered</hi> and <hi>Paralyticks</hi> would
offer to put in for it. St. <hi>John</hi> then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
himſelf, or elſe blundered egregiouſly,
or put the Banter upon us, to try how
far an abſurd Tale would paſs upon the
World with Credit. There might be, if
there was any litteral Senſe in the Story,
many of other Diſtempers, but there could
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1207700300:54"/>
be neither <hi>blind, halt</hi> nor <hi>withered,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>ſuch an Abſurdity,</hi> as abſolutely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parages
the Story, blaſts the Credit of
the <hi>Relator,</hi> or rather brings to mind the
Aſſertion of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> that the Letter
of the <hi>New</hi> as well as the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi>
lies abominably. If what I have here
ſaid does not overthrow the Letter of this
Story; Then what I have,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To add, will do it more effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
and that is, of the <hi>certain Man, that
had an Infirmity thirty and eight Years,</hi> and
lay at this Pool for an Opportunity to be
cured of it. Tho' theſe <hi>thirty</hi> and <hi>eight</hi>
Years are, in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
of this Man's Infirmity, yet more
truely, according to the Original, are they
ſpoken of the Time he lay there; and the
Fathers ſo underſtood St. <hi>John</hi>'s Words.
What this Man's Infirmity was, we are
uncertain: For <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Weakneſs</hi> or <hi>Infirmity</hi>
is a general Name of all Diſtermpers, and
may be equally apply'd to one as well as to
another: Whereupon, tho' we can't certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay from this Man's Infirmity, that he
was a Fool to lay there ſo long, expecting
that Cure, which it was impoſſible for
him to obtain; yet what he ſays to our
Saviour, <hi>I have no Man, when the Waters
are troubled to put me into the Pool, but
while I am coming, another ſteppeth down</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:1207700300:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>before me,</hi> does imply his Folly ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or rather the Incredibility of the whole
Story. What then did this <hi>infirm</hi> Man at
this Pool, if he had neither Legs of his
own good enough, nor a Friend to aſſiſt
him, in the Attainment of Sanarion? Was
he not a Fool, if it was poſſible for any
to be ſo great a one, for his Patience?
Would it not have been as wiſely done
of him to wait, in the Fields ſo long, the
Falling of the Sky, that he might catch
Larks? The Fathers ſay, this Man's <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity</hi>
was the <hi>Palſy</hi>; but whether they
ſaid ſo for the Sake of the Myſtery, or
to expoſe the Letter, I know not. But that
Diſtemper after <hi>thirty</hi> and <hi>eight</hi> Years
Duration, and Increaſe, if it was more
curable than another at firſt, had in that
time undoubtedly ſo weakened and render'd
him uncapable to ſtruggle with others
for this Relief, that it is without Senſe and
Reaſon to think he ſhould wait ſo long for
it. Our <hi>Divines,</hi> if they ſo pleaſe, may
commend this Man for his Patience, but
after a few Years, or rather a few Days
Experience, another Man would have
been convinc'd of the Folly and Vanity
of his Hopes, and returned Home. If
he could not put in for this Benefit, with
Proſpect of Succeſs in his more youthful
Days, when the Diſtemper was young too,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1207700300:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
much leſs Reaſon had he to hope for it
in his old Age, after <hi>thirty</hi> and <hi>eight Years</hi>
Affliction, unleſs he dream'd of, what was
not to be imagined, an Opportunity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Moleſtation and Competition, to go
off with it. Whatever then our <hi>Divines</hi>
may think of this Man and his Patience,
I will not believe there ever was ſuch a
Fool; and for this Reaſon will not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
St. <hi>John</hi> could litterally ſo ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
unleſs he meant to bambouzle
Mankind into the Belief of the greateſt
Abſurdity. A Man that Lies with a Grace
to deceive others, makes his Story ſo
hang together, as to carry the Face and
Appearance of Truth along with it;
which this of St. <hi>John,</hi> that for many
Ages has been ſwallowed, for the Reaſon
before us, has not. But what is the worſt
of all againſt this Story is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly</hi> That which follows, and
abſolutely deſtroys the Fame and Credit
of <hi>Jeſus</hi> for a Worker of Miracles. <hi>And</hi>
V. 1, 2, 3, <hi>Jeſus went up to Jeruſalem,
where there was by the Sheep-Market, a
Pool, called Betheſda, having five Porches,
in which lay a great Multitude of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Folk, blind, halt, withered.</hi> Why then
did not <hi>Jeſus</hi> heal them? Here was a
rare Opportunity for the Diſplay of his
Healing and Almighty Power; and why
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1207700300:57"/>
did he not exerciſe it, to the Relief of
that Multitude of impotent Folk? If
he could not cure them, there's an End
of his Power of Miracles; and if he
would not, it was want of Mercy and
Compaſſion in him. Which way ſoever
we take this Caſe, it turns to the Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Holy <hi>Jeſus.</hi> What then was
the Reaſon, that of ſo great a Multitude
of diſeaſed People, <hi>Jeſus</hi> exerted his
Power, and extended his Mercy, on only
<hi>one</hi> poor Paralytick? St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> 
               <note n="44" place="bottom">Tot jacebant et unus curatus, cum poſſet uno Verbo omnes erigere. Quid ergo intelligendum eſt, niſi quia Poteſtas et Bonitas illa magis agebat, <hi>&amp;c. In Loc. Johan.</hi>
               </note> 
puts this Queſtion and Objection into
my Mouth; and tho' neither He nor I
ſtart it for the Service of Infidelity, but
to make Way for the Myſtery; yet I
know not why <hi>Infidels,</hi> may not make Uſe
of it, till Miniſters of the Letter can give
a ſatisfactory Anſwer and Solution to it.</p>
            <p>The Evangeliſts, <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi> and
<hi>Luke,</hi> tell ſuch Stories of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s healing
Power, as would incline us to think he
cured all where-ever he came. He <hi>heal'd,</hi>
they ſay, <hi>all Manner</hi> of Diſeaſes among
the People, and they make mention of
particular Times and Places, where all
the Diſeaſed were healed by him, which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1207700300:58"/>
Aſſertions imply, that <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s healing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
was moſt extenſive and (excepting to
an hard-hearted and unbelieving <hi>Phariſee</hi>
now and then) univerſal; ſo far that it
might be queſtion'd, whether any died,
during the Time of his Miniſtry, in
the Places where he came: And our
<hi>Divines</hi> have ſo harangued on <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
as would confirm us in ſuch an
Opinion: But this Story in St. <hi>John</hi>
confutes and confounds all. St. <hi>John</hi> in
no Place of his Goſpel talks of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
healing of many, nor of all manner of
Diſeaſes, much leſs of all that were Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed;
which, if it be not like a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to the other <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> is ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
of their Authority, and enough to
make us ſuſpect, that they ſtretch'd much
in praiſe of their Maſter, and ſaid more
to his Honour than was ſtrictly true. But
this Place before us is a flat Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to them, and <hi>Jeſus</hi> is not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to heal many in any Place, much
leſs all manner of Diſeaſes, or he had never
let ſuch a Multitude of poor Wretches
paſs without the Exerciſe of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Pity on them. Some good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
then muſt be given for <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
here, and ſuch a one as will adjuſt
it to the Reports of the other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts;
or <hi>Infidels</hi> will think, that either
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1207700300:59"/>
they romanc'd for the Honour of their
Maſter, or that St. <hi>John</hi> in Spite told
this Story to the Degradation of him.
I can conceive no better of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
according to the Letter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Lichfield</hi> very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
ſays, <note n="45" place="bottom">Defence of Chriſtianity, P. 415.</note> 
               <hi>that Jeſus where-ever
he went, healed all that came to home with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Diſtinction, the important, halt, wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
He certainly had this Text of St.
<hi>John</hi> in his Eye, when he ſaid ſo, becauſe
<hi>Impotent, Halt, Withered,</hi> are only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
here, where Jeſus cured <hi>none</hi> of
them: Whereupon if his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> had
made but a marginal Reference to this
Text, it would have been the beſt Jeſt and
Banter, with a, Sneer, that ever was put
upon <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his Power of Miracles:
As it is, it's a very good one, and I
deſire my Readers to take Notice of
it, that his Lordſhip may not loſe the
Credit and Praiſe of it. It's ſor ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection
of Thought, Exactneſs of
Expreſſion, and Acuteneſs of Wit, that
I admire that <hi>Prelate,</hi> and muſt needs ſay
of him, whether he ever be tranſlated to
<hi>Canterbury</hi> or <hi>York,</hi> or not, that he's an
<hi>arch</hi> Biſhop.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1207700300:60"/>
But to return and go on. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to all Appearance, is not
only blameable, his Power of healing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable,
and his Mercy indefenſible, for
that he cured but <hi>one</hi> infirm Man out of
a Multitude, at <hi>Betheſda,</hi> but,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eightly,</hi> and laſtly, it may reaſonably be
queſtioned, whether he wrought any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
in the healing of this <hi>one</hi> Man.
Miracles (to ſay nothing of the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Diſtinction between divine and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
ones) are Works done out of the
Courſe of Nature, and beyond the Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of human Art of Power. Now
whether the Cure of this infirm Man can
be brought under this Definition of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
may be doubted. What this Man's
<hi>Infirmity,</hi> which is a general Name for
all Diſtempers, was, we know not. How
then can we ſay he was miraculouſly
cured, unleſs, we knew his Diſeaſe to be
incurable by Art, which none can affirm?
The worſt that we know of this Man's
Caſe, is, that it was of a long Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
no leſs than of <hi>eight</hi> and <hi>thirty</hi>
Years: And the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Lichfield</hi> and
others in their florid Harangues of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
Works, make the Cure of ſuch Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Diſeaſes to be miraculous: But why
ſo? Many Inſtances may be given of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
of human Nature, of a long Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1207700300:61"/>
which in Time, and eſpecially in old
Age, wear off. If ſuch Infirmites don't
occur to the Memory of our <hi>Divines,</hi> I
could put them in Mind of them. And
who knows but this was the Caſe of
this impotent Man, whoſe Infirmity <hi>Jeſus</hi>
obſerving to be wearing off, bid him to
be gone, and take up his Couch, for he
would ſoon be made whole.</p>
            <p>The Fathers indeed call this Man's
Infirmity the <hi>Palſy,</hi> which in truth is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
worſe than better by Time, and
after <hi>thirty</hi> and <hi>eight</hi> Years, muſt needs
be very deplorable, and incurable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Miracle. But why do they call
it the Palſy? They have no Authority for
it from the Text, without which, as our
litteral <hi>Doctors</hi> will not ſubſcribe to their
Opinions in other Caſes; ſo why ſhould
I here? In ſhort, the Fathers had never
call'd it the <hi>Palſy,</hi> but for the ſake of the
Myſtery; and I am not bound to own
<hi>that</hi> to have been the Diſtemper, any
more than it was want of Legs; for that
would be making of Miracles for <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
without Reaſon and Authority.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Jeſus</hi> here had healed the whole
<hi>Multitude of impotent Folk</hi>; without En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
what Numbers there might be of
them, I ſhould have believed that he
wrought there many great Miracles, in as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1207700300:62"/>
much as in ſuch a great Multitude, there
muſt needs, in all Probability, be ſome
incurable by Art or Nature: But ſince he
cured only this <hi>one</hi> Man, it affords Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Speculation, whether he was the
<hi>moſt</hi> or the <hi>leaſt</hi> diſeaſed amongſt them.
Our <hi>Divines,</hi> for the ſake of the Miracle,
may poſſibly ſuppoſe him to be the moſt
grieviouſly afflicted of any; but <hi>Infidels,</hi>
on the other hand, will ſay, not ſo:
but with their Cavils will urge that this
infirm Man was either a Diſſembler, whom
<hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhamed out of his pretended Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
or that he was only hippiſh, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyfully
more than really diſtemper'd of
a long Time, whom <hi>Jeſus</hi> by ſuitable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
and Admonitions, working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Imagination, perſuaded into a
Belief of his Cure, and bid him to walk
off. Certain it is, that <hi>Infidels</hi> will ſay,
it was not a Power of Miracles in <hi>Jeſus</hi>
which heal'd him, or he had uſed it then
and there for the Sanation of others alſo.</p>
            <p>And thus have I finiſh'd my Invective
againſt the Letter of this Story; which,
if any are offended at, they enjoy, what
is the moſt reaſonable Thing in the World,
the ſame Liberty to write for the Letter,
which I have uſed againſt it: And ſo I

            <p>The Fathers, upon whoſe Authority
I form'd my preceding Invective a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Letter, ſo univerſally betake
themſelves to the myſtical Interpretation
of this Story, that it may be queſtion'd,
whether any of them, more than myſelf,
believ'd any Thing at all of the Letter
of it. St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> who is as much a
litteral Interpreter of the Scriptures as
any of them, here intirely diſcards the

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1207700300:64"/>

of the Church, which according to the

And how is Mankind to be cured of
his Infirmity at the Spirit of Prophecy?
By being inſtructed, by the Spirit of
Truth, who is to come at the Concluſion
of the ſaid thirty and eight myſtical Years,
<hi>to ariſe and take up his bed and walk,</hi> that
is, to raiſe his Thoughts to the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of the divine Myſteries of the Law,
and to lift up his Bed of the Letter, on
which he has hitherto <hi>reſted,</hi> into a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
Senſe, and then he will walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly
and ſteadily in the Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wavering like a Paralytick.</p>
            <p>And at what Seaſon did <hi>Jeſus</hi> come to
this infirm Man? It was at a Feaſt of the
<hi>Jews. Irenaeus, Chryſoſtom, Theophylact,</hi> and
<hi>Cyril</hi> call it the Feaſt of Penticoſt. And
the grand Feaſt of Penticoſt is, as St.
<hi>Cyril</hi> 
               <note n="57" place="bottom">Quod autem ſub finem Hebdomadum Sanctae Pentecoſtes ipſe revertitur Hieroſolymam, figuratè et aenigmatice ſignificat futurum noſtri Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatoris Reverſionem ultimis praeſentis aevi tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus. <hi>In Loc. Johan.</hi>
               </note> ſays upon the Place, at the
Perfection of Time, the Time of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
Sabbath, and of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s ſpiritual
Advent, which will be a Time of feaſting
on intellectual and divine Myſteries, of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Viſions and of dreaming Dreams; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
at that Time, as the ancient <hi>Jews</hi>
and Fathers aſſert, Mankind will be cured of
this Infirmity at the Spirit of Prophecy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:1207700300:69"/>
And this too is the <hi>certain Seaſon, that
the Angel will deſcend and trouble the
Waters.</hi> By Angel is here meant <note n="58" place="bottom">Turbabat Angelus,—dictus eſt Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus magni conſilii Angelus. <hi>Auguſtin in Serm.</hi> cxxv <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</note> 
the Spirit of Chriſt. And by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the Fathers underſtand, <note n="59" place="bottom">Turbavit Aquam, id eſt, turbavit Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum. <hi>Ejuſdem in Pſ.</hi> cii.</note> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of all Nations. But how will the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
of the Spirit of Truth, like an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
trouble theſe Waters, that is, give
any Moleſtations and Diſturbance to
the People? Is there not a Miſtake in
the Oracle? If the <hi>Clergy</hi> will be but
greater Lovers of Truth than of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts;
if they, who ſhould be Teachers
of Forbearance of one another in Love,
will but keep their Temper, there would
be found a miſtake in it. But alas!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> as is intimated,
ſeem to have been mov'd with Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at the Cure of the infirm Man, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him, v. 10. <hi>it is the Sabbath,
it is not lawful for thee to carry thy
Bed</hi>; which litterally could not be true.
The <hi>Jews</hi> were not ſuch preciſe Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Sabbath; nor <hi>ſo ſtupid and
fooliſh,</hi> as St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> 
               <note n="60" place="bottom">Sabbatum eſt et Grabatum non licet tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere. Quid ſtupidius aut inertius eſſe poteſt <hi>In Loc. Johan.</hi>
               </note> ſays, as to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1207700300:70"/>
think the taking up and carrying a Stool
to be a Breach of it. But myſtically, it
is to be fear'd, this will be moſt true,
and that the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who would be <hi>Jews</hi>
inwardly, and the Circumciſion in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
will be bitter Enemies to Man's
Exaltation of his Couch of the Letter of
the Scriptures on or againſt the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Sabbath, and will make it, if poſſible,
an <hi>unlawful</hi> Work; becauſe it will bring
to them Shame, Diſhonour and Loſs of
Intereſts along with it.</p>
            <p>After this Manner is every other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
of this Story to be allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
apply'd out of the Fathers. The
Moral or Myſtery of the whole, in ſhort,
is this, that at the Perfection of Time,
ſignified by the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi>
the End of <hi>thirty eight Years,</hi> the Spirit
of Truth will deſcend on Mankind, to
their Illumination in Prophecy, and to the
healing of their <hi>Errors,</hi> call'd <hi>Diſeaſes</hi>;
which is admirably repreſented by the
Parable before us, that according to the
Letter has neither Reaſon nor common
Senſe in it.</p>
            <p>And thus have I ſpoken to <hi>eight</hi> of the
Miracles of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; and whether I have
not ſhew'd them, in whole or Part, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Propoſition before us, to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1207700300:71"/>
conſiſt of Abſurdities, Improbabilities,
and Incredibilities; and whether they are
not prophetical and parabolical Narratives
of what will be myſteriouſly, and more
wonderfully done by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> I appeal to
my <hi>Readers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After another Diſcourſe of ſome other
Miracles, I intend to take into Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſeveral Stories of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s raiſing of the
Dead as of <hi>Lazarus, Jairus</hi>'s Daughter,
and the Widow's Son of <hi>Naim</hi>; which
reputedly are <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s grand Miracles;
but for all the ſeeming Greatneſs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of them, I don't doubt but to
give the Letter of theſe Stories a Toſs out
of the Creed of a conſiderate and wiſe Man;
at leaſt ſhow their Inſufficiency for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
for which they have been hitherto
apply'd. And if I ſhould afterwards, by
the Leave and Patience of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of
<hi>London,</hi> give my Objection againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s
Reſurrection a Review, and ſome more
Force, then what will become of the
Argument of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Power, Authority,
and <hi>Meſſiahſhip</hi> from his Miracles?</p>
            <p>But, beſides <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Miracles, I am, as
Opportunity ſerves, to take into Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
ſome of the Hiſtorical Parts of
his Life; and ſhew them to be no leſs ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
abſurd and ridiculous than his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:1207700300:72"/>
And why may I not ſometimes treat
on the Parables of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and ſhow what
nonſenſical and abſurd Things they are,
according to the Expoſitions of our moſt
famous Commentators of theſe laſt Ages.
<hi>Jeſus</hi> was certainly the abſolute, and moſt
conſummate Perfection of a <hi>Cabaliſt,</hi>
               <hi>Myſtiſt,</hi> a <hi>Paraboliſt</hi> and <hi>Enigmatiſt</hi>; but
according to modern Commentaries and
Paraphraſes, he was the mereſt Ideot and
Blockhead that ever open'd his Mouth,
in that ſort of Learning, to the Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Mankind. And I am oblig'd a
little to ſpeak to the Abſurdities of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s
Doctrine and Parables, becauſe one Article
of the Proſecution againſt me was for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>that any of the Philoſophers of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
or <hi>any rational Man</hi> (meaning accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to modern Expoſitions) <hi>would make a
better Teacher, than Jeſus was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a great deal of Work have I up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my Hands, which, if God ſpare my
Life and Health, I intend to go on with:
If what I have already done in it be not
acceptable to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> their Way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Proſecution of this great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
is to battle me upon what's
paſt. Who knows but they may write, if
they would try their Strength, ſo acutely
in Defence of the Letter of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
already diſcuſs'd, as may effectually
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1207700300:73"/>
ſtop my Mouth, and prevent my giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them any more Trouble of this Kind?
And I ſuppoſe I have now gotten an
Adverſary in the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of St. <hi>David</hi>'s,
Who has already diſcharg'd one Fool's Bolt
at me.</p>
            <p>There has nothing been a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Subject of Declamation among the
the <hi>Clergy</hi> than the <hi>Reaſonableneſs</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
which muſt be underſtood of
the Hiſtory of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Life and Doctrine,
or the Application of the Word <hi>Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs</hi>
to the Chriſtian Religion is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.
But if I proceed, as I have
begun in this Work, I ſhall ſhew Chiſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as it is underſtood, to be the moſt
unreaſonable and abſurd Story, that ever
was told; and our modern Syſtems of
Theology groundleſs and ſenſleſs in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every Part of them. <hi>Mahometaniſm,</hi>
without Offence be it ſpoken, is a more
<hi>reaſonable</hi> Religion than the Chriſtian, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
modern <hi>Schemes</hi> and <hi>Syſtems.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If what I here ſay is offenſive to our
<hi>Divines,</hi> the <hi>Preſs</hi> is open for them as well
as for myſelf, and they may, if they can,
ſhew their Reſentment of it. Thanks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God and our moſt excellent Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
for ſuch a Liberty of the <hi>Preſs</hi>:
A Liberty that will lead and conduct us
to the Fountain of Wiſdom and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
which Reſtraint is a down-right Enemy
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1207700300:74"/>
to. And that this Bleſſing of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may be continued, for all <hi>Biſhop Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Rogers's Hobbiſm,</hi> is, I dare
ſay, the Deſire of the curious, inquiſitive,
and philoſophical Part of Mankind. If
this Liberty ſhould be taken away, what
a notable Figure will our <hi>Divines</hi> make
from the <hi>Preſs</hi> and <hi>Pulpit,</hi> declaming
on the Reaſonableneſs, Excellency and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the Chriſtian Religion, without
an Adverſary; and telling their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
that all, their bittereſt and acuteſt
Enemies can object, is clearly anſwered!</p>
            <p>The <hi>Preſs,</hi> of late Years, has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
of ſo many cogent and perſuaſive
Arguments for Liberty of debate, and the
Advocates for this Liberty, in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the impartial and conſiderate,
have ſo far gotten the better of their
Adverſaries, that I wonder any one can
appear in behalf of Perſecution. If I was
a <hi>Biſhop</hi> or <hi>Doctor</hi> in <hi>Divinity,</hi> I ſhoud
think it a Diſgrace to my Station and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation
to ask the Aſſiſtance of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Authority to protect my Religion: I
ſhould judge my ſelf unworthy of the
Wages and Emoluments I enjoy'd, for the
Preaching and Propagation of the Goſpel,
if I was unable to give an Anſwer to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one, that ask'd a Reaſon of my Faith:
Or if I was ſo Shallow-pated, as to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1207700300:75"/>
think Hereſie and Infidelity puniſhable by
the Civil Magiſtrate, I ſhould think my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as much oblig'd to confute by
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> as he is to puniſh by the <hi>Sword.</hi>
If the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>London</hi> had taken this
Courſe with me; if he had publiſh'd a
Refutation of my ſuppoſed Errors, as
well as endeavour'd at a Proſecution
of me for them, I had forgiven him the
Wrongs and Injuries done me, and made
no repeated Demands of Satisfaction for
them.</p>
            <p>Chriſtianity is, as I believe, founded
on a Rock of Wiſdom; and what's more,
has an omnipotent and omniſcient God
on its Side, who can incline the Hearts
of Men to believe, and open the Eyes of
their Underſtanding to diſcern the Truth
of it; conſequently there can be no Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in the Attempts of our Adverſaries,
whether <hi>Jews, Turks</hi> or Domeſtick <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi>
againſt it. But Perſecution implys
Weakneſs and Impotency in God to defend
his own Cauſe; or his Prieſts would not
move for the Help of the Arm of Fleſh in
Vindication of it. And if, at this Time
of Day, after ſo many Treatiſes of <hi>lnfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,</hi>
and ſome of them as yet unanſwered,
againſt our Religion, this good Cauſe
ſhould be taken out of the Hands of
God, and committed to the Care of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1207700300:76"/>
Civil Magiſtrate; if inſtead of Reaſon,
the Clergy ſhould have Recourſe to Force,
what will By-ſtanders, and even Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſhers
to Chriſtianity ſay? Nothing leſs
than that <hi>Infidels</hi> had gotten the better of
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Miniſters, and beaten them at
their own Weapons of Reaſon and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The two great Pleaders for Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to the Diſgrace of themſelves and
Diſhonour of our Religion, that have
lately aroſe are Dr. <hi>Rogers</hi> and the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>
of St. <hi>David</hi>'s. Dr. <hi>Rogers</hi>'s chief
Reaſon againſt Liberty of Debate, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
as he ſays, it is pernicious to the
Peace and Welfare of the Community, by
unſettling the Minds of the People about
the Religion eſtabliſhed: But here's no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, unleſs it could be proved, that
ſuch as the great Mr. <hi>Grounds</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Scheme,</hi> have it in their Hearts to raiſe
Mobbs upon the Government, and to beat
out the Brains of the <hi>Clergy.</hi> All the
Harm, or rather Good, they aim at, is to
exerciſe the Wits of the <hi>Clergy</hi> with their
Doubts and Objections; and if the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> are not raiſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, to the doing of Violence to theſe
<hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the Peace of the Publick will
never de diſturb'd. As to myſelf, tho'
I have a vaſt and numerous Party on
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1207700300:77"/>
my Side, no leſs than all the Fathers and
primitive Chriſtians for ſome Ages; yet
as we were peaceable and quiet Subjects
of old, and paſſively obedient to the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi>; ſo we will continue to the
Civil Authority of this Nation. We on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take the Liberty to awaken the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
out of a Lethargy of Dulneſs and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance;
and hope the Civil Magiſtrate
will conſider the Goodneſs and Charity
of our Intentions, and guard us againſt
their Inſults for it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Biſhop</hi> of St. <hi>David</hi>'s <note n="61" place="bottom">Sermon before the Society for Reformation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 12.</note> ſays,
"It is abſurd to aſſert, that the Liberties
of any Nation will allow, with Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
a Set of diſtinguiſh'd Infidels to
inſult and treat with the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and Scorn the moſt ſacred and
important Truths, that are openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
by the whole Body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
of whatever Denomination." By
a Set of Infidels, I ſuppoſe, he means me
and the Fathers: And by <hi>treating with
Contempt and Scorn the moſt ſacred and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Truths,</hi> he means, our burleſquing,
bantering and ridiculing the <hi>Clergy</hi> for
their Miniſtry of the Letter: And for <hi>this</hi>
he would, I conceive, have incenſed the
<hi>Societies</hi> for Reformation of Manners to a
Proſecution of me. And if they had not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1207700300:78"/>
been wiſer, and more merciful than their
Preacher, I muſt have gone to Pot. But
why ſhould the <hi>Biſhop</hi> diſlike this way of
Writing? Don't he know, that the Fathers
of the Church uſed to jeſt and ſcoff at the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> and their Prieſts for their fooliſh
Superſtitions? Don't he know, that our
<hi>Reformers</hi> banter'd and ridicul'd Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
out of Doors, and almoſt within the
Memory of Man, it was reckon'd but
a dull Sermon, that was not well
humm'd for its Puns and Jeſts on the
Papiſts? why then ſhould the <hi>Biſtop</hi> be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that way of writing, which was of
good Uſe to the <hi>Reformers,</hi> and firſt <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>?
The grand Subject for <hi>Burleſque</hi>
and <hi>Banter,</hi> in my Opinion, is <hi>Infidelity</hi>;
and that <hi>Biſhop,</hi> who can't break two Jeſts
upon <hi>Infidels</hi> for their one upon Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
has but a ſmall Share of Wit. The
Chriſtian Religion according to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi>
will abide the Teſt of calm and ſedate Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
againſt it, but can't bear a Jeſt; O
ſtrange!</p>
            <p>But to leave theſe two Contenders for
Perſecution to the Chaſtiſement of acuter
Pens. What I have here pleaded for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
is not through any Fears of Danger
to myſelf, but for the Love of Truth and
Advancement of Chriſtianity, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, can't be defended, propagated and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1207700300:79"/>
ſincerely embraced. And therefore hope,
that the Controverſy before us, between
<hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Apoſtates</hi> will be continued by
the Indulgence of the Government, till
Truth ariſes and ſhines bright to the Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the Miſts of Error and Ignorance;
like the Light of the Sun to the Diſperſion
of the Darkneſs of the Night. I will by
God's Leave, go on to bear my part in the
Controverſy; And, if it was not more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Intereſts than Reaſon of the
<hi>Clergy</hi> to believe me, would again ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declare that what I do in it is with a
View to the Honour of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> our ſpiritual
<hi>Meſſiah,</hi> to whom be Glory for ever.
Amen.</p>
