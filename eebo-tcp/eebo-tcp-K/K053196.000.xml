            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE medical reader will readily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover part of the following <hi>Eſſay,</hi> to be extracted from the works of the celebrated <hi>Hoffman,</hi> a name well known to the learned world.</p>
            <p>The obſervations 'tis apprehended will be ſupported by the authorities<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Hippocrates, Celſus, Caelius Aurelianus, Lommius, Sydenham, Baglivi, Hoffman, Friend, Mead, Bacon, Boyle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to whom we have not conſtantly referred, in order to avoid prolixity, except where the nature of the ſubject abſolutely require their own words; but the ſentiments of theſe authors, will eaſily be diſcovered in the abſtract, by thoſe acquainted with them.</note> produced, the univerſal aſſent of all the <hi>rationaliſts</hi> in phyſic, and indeed we hope of every rational man.</p>
            <p>A plain and perſpicuous ſtyle is what we have chiefly aimed at, in order to adapt the ſubject, to the comprehenſion of every reader; and we can't help wiſhing this method more frequently purſued by phyſical writers, that the medical ſtudy might be rendered more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining and general: for we are thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfyed, the art would be no ſufferer thereby, but the imputations it is charged with,
<pb facs="tcp:0001601000:3"/>as an obſure, perplexing ſtudy, by this means baniſhed, and itſelf receive new luſtre, in proportion to its being more diffuſed.</p>
            <p>The many errors ſo frequently committed in the adminiſtring of <hi>Noſtrums, Univerſal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,</hi> and particularly for ſome time paſt, of <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>powder,</hi> induced us to point out to the <hi>favourers</hi> of ſuch medicines, the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences and danger, they ſometimes expoſe themſelves too, by their imprudence, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity; in attaching themſelves to <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>any other medicine,</hi> without proper reſtrictions.</p>
            <p>To guard therefore againſt ſuch deluſions, and to render the <hi>unphyſical</hi> reader better qualified to decide, in an affair of ſo much importance, as his own health, and life, is the purport of this <hi>Eſſay;</hi> where by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating the influence <hi>Nature</hi> has over many diſeaſes, he may the readier judge of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal aſſiſtance in general, and on what plan, it can beſt be conducted.</p>
            <p>Should we have ſet this affair in a clearer light, than it has yet appeared in, to the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,</hi> our deſign will be ſufficiently anſwered, and as truth and impartiality were our cheif motives, we ſhall as little regard cenſure, as we court applauſe;</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OTwithſtanding the indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable labours of ſo many able men, for more than two thouſand years paſt, to bring the art of phyſick to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfection the other ſciences have attained; notwithſtanding the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0001601000:5"/>that has been made in many branches of this art; and how enlightened ſoever we may have been by the improvements and diſcoveries of the laſt century; yet it muſt be confeſſed, that the cure of many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, is not yet arrived to a degree of perfection; or is <hi>infallibility</hi> ever like to be an attribute of phyſick. To free a man from pain, and to ſave him from deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is in itſelf noble and god-like, nor is it to be wondered, that the firſt phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians were deified, or that thoſe, who have excelled in this art ſince, have been highly eſteemed and honoured; for as in <hi>natural</hi> things, the <hi>ſun</hi> is the author and fountain of life, ſo the phyſician who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves life, ſeems a ſecond origin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Bacon's doctrine of the human body. Shaw's edit. Sect. 9. vol. 1.</note> Yet happy would it be for mankind, if a more expeditious method of curing ſome <hi>fevers</hi> could be diſcovered, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the patients ſafety? What emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments and applauſes would that man deſerve of his country, whoſe ſtudies had
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0001601000:6"/>been ſo fortunate to diſcover a medicine, which had the power of checking the exorbitance of a <hi>fever,</hi> eluding its force, and entirely eradicating the latent cauſe? How happy, I ſay, if this could be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without waiting the tedious courſe, <hi>nature</hi> is ſometimes obſerved to take, in fitting and preparing the <hi>febrile</hi> matter for a ſeparation, and expulſion from the blood, in order to a ſalutary <hi>criſis;</hi> or if even thoſe aſſiſtances <hi>art</hi> has hitherto employed, in accelerating theſe <hi>criſes,</hi> or rendering them unneceſſary, could be effected with leſs danger.</p>
            <p>Such a purſuit and ſtudy is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly laudable and beneficent, and tho' the whole ſcience may be too abſtruſe, and extenſive, for the human mind to comprehend;<note n="†" place="bottom">Of all the things that <hi>nature</hi> hath created, the <hi>human body</hi> is moſt capable of <hi>relief;</hi> tho' this <hi>relief</hi> be the moſt liable to error. For as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, and variety of the ſubject affords many oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of <hi>cure;</hi> ſo likewiſe great facility of <hi>miſtake.</hi> And therefore, as this <hi>art,</hi> eſpecially at preſent, ſtands among the moſt <hi>conjectural ones,</hi> ſo the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into it, is to be placed among the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and difficult. Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> ib.</note> though, like the <hi>philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0001601000:7"/>ſtone,</hi> and <hi>longitude,</hi> it ſeems at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with inſuperable difficulties; yet, when diſcoveries, in particular branches, are offered to us with modeſty, candour, and impartiality, abſtracted from <hi>merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary views,</hi> or the arts of <hi>deſigning men;</hi> they certainly merit our notice, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demand our attention: but ſhould we find they want theſe intrinſic characters, theſe genuine marks of truth; that they are ſupported by the <hi>ſophiſtry</hi> of the artful and deſigning, or protected by the <hi>bigottry</hi> of <hi>credulous</hi> and <hi>improper judges;</hi> ſure it becomes high time to unmask the <hi>impoſtors,</hi> and detect the chicanerie; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſo important a cauſe as that, wherein our <hi>healths</hi> and <hi>lives</hi> are ſo prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally concerned: for as all ages have abounded with falſe <hi>pretenders,</hi> who have deluded the unwary, under the ſpecious appearance of ſerving the publick, ſo <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical</hi> impoſitions have been more noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and ſucceſsful: nor indeed is it to be wondered at, that this <hi>tribe</hi> ſhould be ſo numerous and prevalent, when ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements are given them; and when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0001601000:8"/>we conſider how few are qualified to judge properly, either of <hi>diſeaſes,</hi> or <hi>remedies;</hi> or to diſtinguiſh between the <hi>powers of art,</hi> and <hi>the influence of nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe</hi> are the chief points we ſhall endeavour to render more obvious and familiar, for it is neither our deſign, or intention, to enquire into the cauſes, which have retarded this wiſhed for perfection; or to point out the obſtacles, which by <hi>ſome</hi> are thought to have impeded the completion of ſo noble a <hi>fabrick,</hi> after ſo fair a foundation laid by our <hi>predeceſſors</hi> of old: we ſhall therefore firſt obſerve, that poſſibly an invariable method of curing diſeaſes, can never be laid down, ſo long as different temperaments of the air, climates, ſeaſons, and conſtitutions, are ſo frequently introducing new and various diſeaſes; which, tho' often in many reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects ſimilar to others, which have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded them, yet do they differ from them very eſſentially, and of courſe require very different treatment. Without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the authorities of ſuch ſagacious
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0001601000:9"/>writers, as Hippocrates, Sydenham, Boer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haave, Hoffman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoſe accurate and faithful obſervations would be indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in ſuch a point; Who is there capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of making proper remarks in practice, to whom this truth has not occurred? And who but from hence muſt have been convinced, that in the direction of <hi>medicine,</hi> due attention muſt be paid to <hi>particular ſymptoms,</hi> without being ſlaviſhly attached to <hi>particular forms?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as the diligent obſervers<note n="§" place="bottom">Vid. Hippocrates, de morb. vulg. Lib. vi. Sect. v. Celſus lib. 3. ch. 1. Lommii com. de ſanit. tuend.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0001601000:10"/>by <hi>art;</hi> to point out when it is in her power to relieve <hi>herſelf,</hi> and when without the help of <hi>art,</hi> ſhe would deſtroy herſelf; and this will naturally lead us to the true ſtudy of the <hi>medical art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the word <hi>nature</hi> is variouſly defined, we deſire to be underſtood by it, the laws of motion, originally implanted in the <hi>machine,</hi> in order to ſet it in action, and preſerve it ſo; by this natural mechaniſm of our bodies, whatever prove injurious to us is often thrown off ſome way, or other, provided the courſe of <hi>nature</hi> be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted. This power of <hi>nature</hi> is ſo extraordinary in ſome conſtitutions, that in ſpite of all the blunders that are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently committed, men recover even from the moſt dangerous fevers.</p>
            <p>That we may the better judge of the nature of a diſeaſe, or fever, it may by <hi>ſome</hi> perhaps be thought no uſeleſs digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to enquire wherein <hi>health</hi> conſiſts, that by a proper definition of the term, we may the better underſtand, when it is perverted,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0001601000:11"/>and by what means, either of <hi>nature,</hi> or <hi>art,</hi> it is again reſtored.</p>
            <p>The <hi>health</hi> then of every animal body depends on a regular, moderate, and equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circulation, of a proper condition'd blood, a due ſecretion, and execretion, of the <hi>juices</hi> or <hi>humours</hi> from it, and a proper degree of elaſticity in the ſolids. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation once diſturbed, and theſe ſecreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons once perverted, are the cauſe of almoſt all diſeaſes. Thus from obſtructed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, or ſweats ſuddenly ſuppreſſed, the fluids that ſhould freely flow off through the pores and glands of the skin, recoil on the blood, increaſe its quantity, and pervert its quality: a redundancy of bile, or an undue ſecretion of it in the liver, becomes productive of many and various diſeaſes, ſuch as bilious cholics, jaundices, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the liver, St. Anthony's fire, fevers, and many other diſorders ariſing from its acrimony and ſtimulus. From this ſpecimen, we may judge of the ill effects, which are the conſequence of the reſt; for whenever theſe ſecretions are not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0001601000:12"/>regularly carried on, the conſtitution is ſure to be injured; and theſe <hi>humours</hi> or <hi>juices</hi> ſo amicable before, by being now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, are made capable of producing an infinity of diſorders.</p>
            <p>We come now to explain, what we mean by <hi>nature</hi> curing diſeaſes, and how or by what ways ſhe effects this purpoſe and here among many others <hi>ſhe</hi> takes, to remove an offending enemy, brought on frequently by a ſuppreſſion of one, or other, of the above <hi>ſecretions;</hi> if the cauſe be ſlight, <hi>ſhe</hi> frequently throws off the load of impure ſerum, by the glands of the noſe and fauces, by coughs, a looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, urine, and ſweats; which if untimely ſuppreſſed by <hi>art,</hi> are ſure to bring life in danger, or at leaſt foretell a future diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. But her moſt general method, when the diſeaſe is more important, is by raiſing a <hi>fever</hi> for her relief, and increaſing the motion of the circulating fluids;<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Hale's Haemaſtaticks, vol. ii. P. 101.</note> by this means ſhe removes obſtructions, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0001601000:13"/>threaten life; by this the ſuperfluous, impure, and viſcid fluids, which choak up the veſſels, are attenuated, diſperſed, and thrown off by urine, ſtool, or perſpiration: in other caſes, when the veſſels are too turgid, <hi>ſhe</hi> often relieves their diſtending fullneſs, by burſting open their mouths, and bringing on a ſalutary bleeding, by thoſe of the <hi>naſe, uterus,</hi> and <hi>anus;</hi> and thus delivers <hi>berſelf</hi> from the oppreſſive load.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the ways ſhe takes to relieve herſelf in acute diſorders, as fevers: nor is ſhe ſometimes leſs ſucceſsful, in the cure of old, ſtubborn, and chronical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; Aſthma's of long ſtanding have been cured by a St. Anthony's fire thrown out on the ſurface; epilepſies by ſcorbutic eruptions; and even melancholy and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the piles. However it muſt be confeſſed that the <hi>power of nature</hi> is not ſo often manifeſt in the cure of <hi>chronic,</hi> as <hi>acute</hi> diſorders, which latter are often effected ſolely by her own means, as the former generally are by <hi>art.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0001601000:14"/>
            <p>After having taken notice of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ways <hi>nature</hi> takes to relieve herſelf, and obſerved, that the moſt greivous diſeaſes are ſometimes happily terminated and cured, without <hi>medical</hi> aſſiſtance; few arguments can be thought neceſſary to inforce this ſtudy of <hi>nature</hi> and her laws, as preferable to any other; for if it is moſt certain, that nature often prevails over art, which ſhould always be her <hi>aſſiſtant</hi> and <hi>imitator,</hi> we may juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the method by which nature alone cures diſeaſes ſhould be ſtudied, as worthy our imitation, and more particular regard.</p>
            <p>For whoever doth not attend to natures motions in relieving her, will moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do her great injury; which is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the caſe with thoſe, who before the febrile matter is moveable and diſſolved, or prepared for ſeparation, endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel it untimely, and by ways neither adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that purpoſe, or to which ſhe has any tendency herſelf. Thus as Hoffman ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0001601000:15"/>* it is to be lamented, that we every day ſee unskillful phyſicians, truſting too much to their NOSTRUMS, without having any regard to indications, method, or time, with reſpect to the diſeaſe, and thereby often bring the patient into extreme dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but if <hi>nature</hi> be powerful enough to elude the force of the medicine, and triumph over the diſeaſe, they then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogantly boaſt of the importance of the cure, and gain both fame and rewards by their raſhneſs; but ſuch imprudent men are not to be truſted, for ſure it is not the leaſt part of the phyſicians art, to know the courſe, genius, and ſalutary ways of nature, that he may not diſturb her operations, or aſſiſt her improperly.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in curing diſeaſes, 'tis evident there are many, where ſhe wants aſſiſtance, and would often deſtroy herſelf without timely relief, by the very means ſhe endeavours for her preſervation; the ſymptoms brought<note place="bottom">F.

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0001601000:16"/>on by her own efforts, being often more dangerous than the diſeaſe itſelf; ſo that in many diſeaſes, a great part of the phyſicians work, is to appeaſe her fury, and correct her errors; for being ſometimes tranſported as it were, with a blind and impetuous paſſion, ſhe unſeaſonable produces thoſe dangerous, diſorders in the body, that demand the ſuccour of art. Thus to what ſalutary purpoſe are thoſe violent ſpaſms which ariſe from ſome poiſons taken inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, but to retain the enemy, ſhe wants to expell? Of what uſe to her, are thoſe various convulſions, which ariſe from fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulencies and worms in the bowels? To what purpoſe thoſe direful pains, thoſe vehement, and acute fevers, which ariſe from the ſlighteſt injury, or puncture of nerve, or tendon? Certainly theſe enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous commotions are worſe than the cauſe, for whoſe ſake according the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montians, they were by provident nature appointed for her relief; for unleſs art ſoon runs to her aſſiſtance, they will moſt inevitably bring her into great danger, if not deſtroy her. What ſuccour can nature
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0001601000:17"/>bring to fixed inflammations of the head, lungs, uterus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without the help of art. The venereal lues was never cured by nature. The dry and bilious cholic, with ſome others, require the immediate aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of art: inveterate ſchrophulous, ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butic, and leprous diſorders, nature never removed. The gout, epilepſy, madneſs, dropſies, gravel and ſtone, worms, and many other diſorders that might be enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated, tho' all of them are ſtrong proofs of the little power nature has over them, yet many of them are known to be cured by the efficacy of medicine, and all of them have been alleviated thereby. In ſhort with Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Free inquiry into the vulgar notion of nature Shaw's edit. p. 143.</note> we may look on a good phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, not properly as a ſervant to nature, but a counſellor, and a friendly aſſiſtant; who in his patients body furthers thoſe motions, and other things, that he judges conducive to the welfare and recovery of it; but as to thoſe he perceives likely to be hurtful, either by encreaſing the diſeaſe,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0001601000:18"/>or otherwiſe endangering the patient, he thinks it is his part to oppoſe or hinder, tho' nature manifeſtly ſeems to endeavour to increaſe, or carry on thoſe hurtful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Thus many of the miſeries, to which human nature is ſubject, may be relieved by proper aſſiſtances, and with Aſclepiades we may ſay, <hi>naturam et prodeſſe &amp; nocere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be neceſſary to obſerve here, that tho' <hi>art</hi> is chiefly inſtrumental in the cure of chronical diſeaſes, yet it is under the auſpices of <hi>nature,</hi> and effected by a proper imitation of her ways. What elſe is meant by giving warm, ſtimulating, pungent, and volatile medicines, with ſteel and mineral waters, but to encreaſe the motion of the circulating fluids, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a certain degree of <hi>fever.</hi> Are not the cures of ſome rheumatiſms, palſys, and many other diſorders, accompliſhed by theſe means; by attenuating and melting down the viſcid fluids, and opening their obſtructed channels by this accelerated motion. Thus as a certain degree of <hi>fever</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0001601000:19"/>is neceſſary to remove acute, ſo alſo chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſorders; and as a late writer has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, could a phyſician certainly raiſe a <hi>fever,</hi> and keep it to what height he pleaſed, many chronic diſorders might be thus cured; but tho' this cannot be effected by art, yet nature may be imitated by direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the above medicines, which by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience have been found ſucceſsful for this purpoſe, ſo that in many caſes, it may be ſaid, the <hi>fever</hi> is not the <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> but the <hi>remedy, et dolor, eſt medicina doloris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence then we learn, that though <hi>nature</hi> often cures diſeaſes, yet ſhe often ſtands in need of medical help; tho' it is more evidently obſerved in <hi>chronic,</hi> than <hi>acute</hi> caſes; for we ſpeak not of thoſe which come under the ſurgeon's cogniſance, where ſhe muſt often be deſtroyed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out immediate manual aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Nor is it the leaſt part of the phyſicians ſkill to know when to give it, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguſh between the force of nature and art, between the effects and bounds of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0001601000:20"/>Happy is he then, who has made nature his ſtudy, who knows when to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain her exorbitant, and when to rouſe her languid motions; who foreſees when to give her timely ſuccour, and can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh when he does her moſt ſervice, by attempting to do leaſt for her; for 'tis a grand miſtake to conclude that <hi>nature</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wants the aſſiſtance of <hi>art,</hi> it being the beſt remedy ſometimes to <hi>uſe none at all</hi> But according to Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly take a view of nature, as from a remote eminence; and are too much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed with <hi>generalities:</hi> whereas if they would deſcend and approach nearer to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and more exactly and conſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examines into things themſelves, they might make more ſolid and uſeful diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries. No doubt therefore, if phyſicians, leaving generalities for a while, would advance towards nature; they might be able to <hi>vary their art as diſtempers vary.</hi>

            <p>This knowledge however can only be attained by experience, and ſedulous obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and a perfect acquaintance with thoſe <hi>indefatigable guides,</hi> who ſtudied <hi>nature</hi> carefully, and have left us the fruits of thoſe ſtudies on record: to this end alſo a man ſhould be well acquainted with natural philoſophy, the materia medica, and the animal oeconomy; have a genius, and penetrating ſagacity, to be able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the true cauſes of diſeaſe, from effects; the certain powers of medicine, with the bounds of <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>art;</hi> for there are in phyſick, as in the natural and moral world, general laws, univerſal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and a perpetual analogy, between art and nature, that runs through the whole ſcience for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore, ſays the great <hi>Pitcairn,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Orat. on the art of phyſick.</note> if we are inclined to deſerve well of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of phyſick, that is, of all mankind, follow this excellent rule; for it is our duty to compare the observations that have been made by others, and continue to be made
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0001601000:22"/>every where, upon diſeaſes and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, without any regard to opinions: which are nothing in compariſon to the certain conviction of our ſenſes.</p>
            <p>But how few, as Dr. <hi>Friend,</hi> has taken notice, are qualified to make judicious obſervations on their experience?<note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſtory of phyſick, p. 308. vol. 1.</note> For the word is often made uſe of, when the effects do not plainly appear. He farther obſerves, that a man may practice and practice all the days of his life, and yet be never the wiſer for his experience, if he neglects to make the proper obſervations, which that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience might ſuggeſt to him; and it is not very likely, he ſhould be over nice in his obſervations, who conſtantly goes on in his firſt tract, and has no other ſcheme, but his own narrow notions in his view: whereas the ſearcher of authors, has the benefit of other men's experience, together with his own, and it is from the joint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, that we can hope for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable advancements of knowledge.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0001601000:23"/>Were it not for this, the oldeſt phyſician would always be the beſt phyſician; and there would be little or no difference, even as to the <hi>ſcientific</hi> part, between an old nurſe, and the moſt regular profeſſor.</p>
            <p>Thus is it plain that practice <hi>alone</hi> will not teach a man the art;<note n="*" place="bottom">Barker's eſſay on the <hi>agreement</hi> between an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and modern phyſicians, p. 73.</note> for there are not wanting inſtances of practitioners, who are grown old in buſineſs, but for want of being early inſtructed in the principles of the art, are almoſt as abſolute ſtrangers to it, as they were at firſt ſetting out. The practice of theſe men has always been, empirical and by receipts, and as their minds have never been ſufficiently enlightened with true ſcience, to purſue it properly; ſo they catch at every <hi>new medicine,</hi> like drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men at every twig, in hopes of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting a little longer a ſinking reputation. Such is the fluctuating ſtate of the mind, unleſs a man is thoroughly grounded in the rudiments of his art; for like one perplexed in a labyrinth, unleſs the right path is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0001601000:24"/>purſued, he is continually erring and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking his way; treading again and again in the ſame tract, till he is tired; yet is he often deceived in the mazey round, and frequently flatters himſelf, with the purſuit of the true path.</p>
            <p>This naturally leads us to enquire into the force, and power, of ſome favourite medicines, which are given in <hi>acute fevers;</hi> and are ſuppoſed now and then, to work ſuch ſpeedy recoveries; when the cure in general, rather depends upon a <hi>due</hi> regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in diet, and proper regimen in other reſpects, than any <hi>peculiar medicine:</hi> but our fondneſs to ſuch remedies, generally riſes in proportion to our <hi>credulity, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> or <hi>prejudices;</hi> for rather than attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute any good change in the diſtemper, to the power of ſuch regimen; it flatters the vanity of ſome, to aſcribe it to a medicine of his own preſcribing, tho' ever ſo insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant. How often have the moſt ſimple things, luckily timed at the criſis of a fever, been applauded for effects, they had no pretenſions to; for nature who often
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0001601000:25"/>triumphs over ſlight obſtacles, little cares to whom the honour is attributed, ſo that ſhe herſelf comes off victorious. This might be abundantly exemplified in a great variety of inſtances, to the conviction of the moſt ſanguine bigot: and indeed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, and competent judges, will readily confeſs, that nothing is more difficult to aſcertain, than the <hi>true virtue</hi> of medicines: for their effects in general rather take their force, from the judgment of the phyſician, in their juſt application, than from any conſtant and inherent virtue of their own. The learned Dr. <hi>Friend</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Friend Emmenologia, de remediorum viribus.</note> hath curiouſly obſerved, and ſhewn, that the different operation of remedies, ariſes not from any change of virtue in the medicament, which continues always the ſame; but from the different ſtate of the body, wherein it is applied.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>bark</hi> taken in the fever fit, ſhall often purge, between it, bind; <hi>Opium</hi> inſtead of controuling watchings, ſhall fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0001601000:26"/>increaſe them; <hi>Aloes</hi> whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is to purge, ſhall in ſome caſes, tho' given for that purpoſe, not operate at all; while reſtringents, ſhall in other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions occaſion purging. <hi>Steel, Antimony, Mercury,</hi> &amp;c. might be brought to eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date this truth; and prove their different effects on different conſtitutions; as well as when they are injudiciouſly directed.</p>
            <p>But as it may be neceſſary, to ſet this affair in a clearer light, to prevent being miſunderſtood; and to ſhew, when <hi>nature</hi> can do without <hi>art,</hi> and where the latter is requiſite; I muſt beg leave to explain myſelf a little farther, on both theſe heads. Who then, ever ſo ſlightly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with acute diſorders, but muſt have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that fevers in their infancy, are frequently and eaſily removed, by very ſimple means; or rather that the FEVER, which is nature's inſtrument, aſſiſted by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution with ſmall liquors, and abſtinence from animal diet, ſeldom wants any other helps; but where bleeding and gentle eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations are joined to theſe, the end is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally accompliſhed in a few days; for by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0001601000:27"/>this; method, the fluids are diluted, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions renewed, and the fullneſs of the veſſels abated: and to ſpeak ingenuouſly, 'tis extremely probable, that faſting, and abſtemiouſneſs, would cure many, and prevent moſt diſtempers; had men reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough to purſue it for a ſufficient length of time, under proper regulations.</p>
            <p>But when this method has been neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and repeated colds, or acts of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, are urged on one another; aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a <hi>heating</hi> regimen, or <hi>hotter</hi> medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; we muſt not wonder at the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that often attend the removal of <hi>ſuch a fever;</hi> for the blood and other juices, are <hi>now</hi> become too viſcid or ſizey, to circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in the finer veſſels; hence frequently from ſuch obſtructions, ariſe inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in particular parts; which if not ſoon removed by <hi>art,</hi> terminate in matter, or fatal gangrenes. In other <hi>fevers,</hi> the blood is in the reverſe ſtate, being too rare, thin, and acrimonious; tending to diſſolution, and putrefaction; which by the rapidity of the circulation, is frequently forced thro'
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0001601000:28"/>the extremities of the ſmall arteries, and are the cauſe of malignant eruptions, and violent bleedings. Here indeed it is high time for <hi>art</hi> to interpoſe, for <hi>nature</hi> is no longer her own aſſiſtant, but will ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy herſelf, without timely ſuccour: under theſe different circumſtances, the skillful phyſician has ſufficient opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of diſtinguiſhing his prudence, and abilities, for the ſtorm is now raiſed, the pungent pains are become inſupportable; the diſturbed functions of the mind, call aloud to be be-calm'd, that reaſon may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume her throne; now is the time to aſſiſt her effectually, either by curbing her inordinate tranſports, or ſuccouring her languiſhing ſtruggles: Here the cautious preſcriber, will guard well againſt either extream, leaſt by an injudi cious applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he may aggravate the cauſe, by adding fuel to a fire which burns but too intenſily already, or check that <hi>vital flame,</hi> that is but too nigh extinguiſhed. Here <hi>he</hi> who has carefully ſtudied the laws of <hi>nature</hi> and obſerved the ways <hi>ſhe</hi> ſometimes takes to relieve herſelf, will be beſt able, to give
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0001601000:29"/>her that aſſiſtance, ſhe now ſo much wants; while <hi>he,</hi> who is only acquainted with her in <hi>ſpeculation,</hi> will ſtand amazed, and affrighted at ſymptoms he never ſuſpected, and impotently attack the diſeaſe, on the ſtrength of ſome favourite <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> or ſome darling NOSTRUM.</p>
            <p>From this portrait, or deſcription of two different kinds of fevers only, one may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable inquire how far any one method, or <hi>medicine,</hi> is like to anſwer both inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but before we venture to mention our own thoughts on this head, let us take the opinion of the immortal <hi>Sydenham,</hi> that candid, and judicious obſerver; who ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">Swan's Sydenham, p. 293.</note> there are various kinds of fevers, moſt of which require their <hi>peculiar method</hi> of cure, different from the reſt; and that the ſame individual fever, of whatever kind it be, requires one treatment at the firſt, and another ſomewhat different, through all its ſtages, as long as it continues. Many other ſimilar paſſages might be extracted
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0001601000:30"/>from this great man's works. Let us hear alſo the experienced <hi>Baglivi,</hi> who ſays,<note n="†" place="bottom">Baglivi's practice of phyſick, p. 271.</note> a great many have ſuch an affection to ſome one remedy, that they think it alone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to a ſovereign virtue, and power, of curing almoſt all diſeaſes; either by reaſon of a lucky event, obſerved now and then to enſue the uſe of it, or rather by a certain innate propenſity that they have, not only of crying up ſome medicines, but aſcribing to them <hi>fictitious</hi> virtues: but I muſt obſerve by the bye, ſays he, that no phyſician can cure a fever happily, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he informs himſelf of the febrile ſtate of the blood; whether it is too rapid, thin, or inflammable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or on the other hand, apt to congeal, thick, malignant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For in ſuch different ſtates of the blood, the indications of cure muſt be diverſifyed accordingly. The honourable Mr. BOYLE in his treatiſe on the uſefull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of philoſophy, obſerves, that it is much more difficult, than men can imagine, to make an accurate experiment in phyſic,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0001601000:31"/>for often the ſame diſeaſe proceeding, in ſeveral perſons, from quite different cauſes, will be increaſed in one, by the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, which has cured it in an other and not only the <hi>conſtitutions</hi> of patients, may as much alter the <hi>effects</hi> as the <hi>cauſes</hi> of diſeaſes; but even in the ſame patient, and in the ſame diſeaſe, the ſingle circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time, may have almoſt as great an operation upon the ſucceſs of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, as either of the two former particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. The learned FRIEND<note n="*" place="bottom">Shaw's edit. vol. 1. p. 176.</note> on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alſo obſerves, that a man who has the leaſt acquaintance with phyſic, muſt be ſenſible, that a univerſal medicine muſt be a <hi>cheat;</hi> and though it be ever ſo good and valuable a medicine itſelf, yet it is utterly impoſſible it can be equally appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to all perſons, in all caſes, and at all junctures; and therefore it muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the skill of ſome diſcerning phyſician, who is well appriſed of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſymptoms of the diſeaſe, where<note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſtory of phyſick, vol. 1. p. 78.</note>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0001601000:32"/>to give it, and where to forbear. We need not go far for a proof of this: we have a convincing one in that great, and perhaps the <hi>only ſpecifick,</hi> the <hi>bark:</hi> which if uſed indifferently, and without judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even in intermitting caſes, has a chance to do as much hurt as good. But I forbear making further quotations, from other writers of equal eminence, that the reader, may not be tired.</p>
            <p>If theſe things be true, if ſuch <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities</hi> are to be relied on, how abſurd is it, to ſuppoſe <hi>any medicine</hi> can be poſſeſs'd of the unerring faculty, of removing all fevers; and yet this opinion, however diſſonant to reaſon, and common ſenſe it may be, appears to have it's <hi>abettors;</hi> and I am ſorry to ſay it, among ſome <hi>few</hi> too, who call themſelves <hi>phyſician;</hi> contrary indeed to the ingenuous declaration of the <hi>learned publiſher</hi> of this remedy, who in the following paſſages in his diſſertation on fevers, as well as in his <hi>daily practice,</hi> manifeſtly diſavows ſuch a <hi>general</hi> power in his preparation. I am obliged ſays
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0001601000:33"/>he,<note n="*" place="bottom">James's diſſertation on fevers, p. 40.</note> to own, that as I eſteemed life too ſacred to be hazarded, for the ſake of an experiment, I have <hi>never</hi> neglected to call in <hi>all other medicinal aids,</hi> to my aſſiſtance, when I thought the caſe required them, and believed that they would be of ſervice. Again<note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. p. 46.</note> as I would be extreamly cautious of leading any one into error, in an affair of ſo much importance, as is that of life, I muſt remark, that when violent inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the vital parts threaten imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate deſtruction, I ſhould think it impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to neglect repeated bleedings, purges, clyſters, and <hi>all other aſſiſtances,</hi> which the art of medicine can afford.</p>
            <p>After ſuch plain and candid conceſſions, one would think it was impoſſible, that any but ſtupid bigots, or ſuperſtitious old women, unacquainted with ſuch auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, would ſolely depend upon this reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and in the moſt deſperate caſes.

            <p>And who, among ſuch a <hi>group of auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries,</hi> can pretend to ſay, what ſhare of merit, becomes due to <hi>the powder?</hi> The Dr. himſelf ingenuouſly confeſſes, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times could not determine how far it was inſtrumental in the cure;<note n="†" place="bottom">James's diſſertation on fevers, p. 34.-13.</note> nor indeed how ſhould he.</p>
            <p>How abſurd then muſt it appear to every <hi>impartial</hi> man, who reflects cooly, that a medicine, which it is acknowledged may demand all theſe <hi>occaſional aſſiſtances,</hi> ſhould without reſtrictions, be thus <hi>raſhly</hi> and <hi>univerſally</hi> recommended <hi>by ſome</hi> in all fevers; for whatever limitations may be hinted at in the treatiſe, can it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that thoſe unacquainted with the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0001601000:35"/>ſcience of phyſic, can diſtinguiſh, from the rules there laid down, <hi>when</hi> to employ theſe auxilaries? Neither can Dr. <hi>James,</hi> always be at hand to, direct them, and who leſs acquainted with that medicine, would risk their reputations, by being concerned with it, on ſuch important occaſions, where lives are at ſtake; much leſs can it be poſſible, that the promiſcuous admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of this remedy, to diſeaſes of ſuch <hi>general Names,</hi> as are mentioned in the <hi>advertiſement,</hi> can be ſucceſsful; when the conditions of theſe diſeaſes, do ſo perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vary.</p>
            <p>But if the operation, and effects of this medicine are to be <hi>rationally,</hi> and not <hi>empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically</hi> accounted for; if it is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by the ſame teſts, that all others are; we ſhall find, that like them, it muſt be directed, and given with prudence, and skill, to render it efficacious, and prevent it's being injurious. For example if it has been found ſucceſsful in thinning and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating the <hi>viſcid, ſizy</hi> blood and fluids, is it not likely to be prejudicial in caſes,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0001601000:36"/>where the fluids are already too <hi>thin</hi> and <hi>rare?</hi> If it has been found uſeful, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the ſecretions of the glands of the ſkin, inteſtines, and kidneys, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting ſtools, urine, and ſweats, may it not be injurious, in thoſe caſes, where theſe ſecretions are but too <hi>liberal</hi> already? That this is evidently the caſe in ſome <hi>colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quative fevers,</hi> appears by the broken tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the blood; where the particles being too much diſſolved, are daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting the patient, by running off too faſt, through the pores, by melting ſweats, or the bowels by watery ſtools.</p>
            <p>How prepoſterous, how inconſiſtent then muſt be the practice of thoſe, who give it thus indiſcriminately; and who thus wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly trifle with <hi>lives,</hi> they are intruſted with? But ſurely the folly of ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedure can want no illuſtration. Could a man alſo without horror reflect, on being acceſſory to the untimely death of a friend, or neighbour, by the vomiting power of an antimonial medicine, given without previous, or proper bleedings, in inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0001601000:37"/>of the <hi>lungs,</hi> or <hi>brain,</hi> truſting to this medicine <hi>ſolely,</hi> in ſuch <hi>important</hi> diſeaſes, contrary to the expreſs rules of Dr. <hi>James?</hi> This though a real proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, yet has been done, and by the direction of ſome, who ought to know better; for can the moſt ſanguine abettors of this medicine, pretend to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this operation, as it is one of its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral effects,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. James's paper of inſtructions, where he ſays, this medicine is ſometimes found to operate pretty briskly by way of vomiting, &amp;c.</note> the continuance of which may depend on the juices it accidentally meets with in the ſtomach?

            <p>But if ſuch be the barrenneſs of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria medica. or the <hi>incapacity</hi> of the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, in drawing his indications of cure, that this muſt be the <hi>popular,</hi> and <hi>faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> remedy; let us at leaſt have the <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>honeſty,</hi> to treat it, as we do other medicines; for by theſe means only, can it obtain a juſt reputation: let us then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it within its proper ſphere of action and give it in ſuch caſes only, as it appears, calculated for; which from our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſeems chiefly to be in the beginning of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0001601000:39"/>ſlight fevers, which ariſe from indigeſtions, or taking cold; for by its ſtimulus on the ſtomach and bowels, thoſe organs may be thus cleanſed of their indigeſted particles, their, feculencys thereby removed, and the ſweats it generally procures, aſſiſted by plentiful dilution, may ſet open the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and thus by removing the ſurcharge early, nature is left at more liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover cover herſelf. Should it on <hi>fair trials</hi> be found to ſuit other <hi>indications,</hi> let it be given with diſcretion; but if our views are not anſwered ſoon, let us not, <hi>Sangrado</hi> like, obſtinately perſevere as <hi>ſome</hi> do, to the patients deſtruction; that we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the juſt reproaches of an injured family, who may be made ſufferers by our wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and imprudence; and prevent thoſe bitter reflections, that will recoil onour owm minds, by being thus acceſſory to them.</p>
            <p>Medicines of this kind, as <hi>generally gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> tis true may ſave <hi>ſome</hi> the trouble of <hi>thinking,</hi> and <hi>ſearching</hi> for indications; which every prudent man thinks abſolutely neceſſary, before, he preſcribes; but this compendious method cancels all tyes, or
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0001601000:40"/>duty of this kind; abjures this ſlaviſh at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the ſtudy of <hi>nature,</hi> and her <hi>laws,</hi> as deluſive, and deſultory; reduces the ſcience of phyſic to a narrower com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and inſtead of leading, or kindly aſſiſting nature, forces her to be obedient, and follow the ways they chooſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe her. Such implements however in phyſic, are like edge tools in the hands of children, or weapons of deſtruction in thoſe of madmen; the ſimplicity of the one, converting them to their own prejudice, and the inſanity of the other, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of thoſe about them: and this obſervation we apprehend will always hold true, that this or any other valuable medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, can only be of <hi>real ſervice,</hi> when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected with judgment; and that it is the <hi>judicious timeing,</hi> and adapting the <hi>medicine,</hi> to the <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> that makes it either a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial <hi>remedy,</hi> or a <hi>deſtructive poiſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We deſire it may particularly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that the violent ſweats extorted by ſudoriſic medicines in fevers, but too often aggravate the diſorder, though they

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid.

            <p>From what then has been advanced in relation to the powers of <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>art;</hi> in regard to the uſe of medicine <hi>in general,</hi> and this <hi>powder</hi> in particular; we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that in many acute diſorders, or fevers, <hi>nature</hi> is often her own, and beſt phyſician; that the aſſiſtances from art ſhould <hi>in general</hi> be cautiouſly directed; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways drawn, from ſuch indications, as the ſymptoms point out, and muſt be varied
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0001601000:44"/>in proportion to the nature of the diſeaſe: That <hi>no one medicine,</hi> can ever anſwer ſo many different purpoſes; more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally one whoſe <hi>operations</hi> are ſo <hi>precarious;</hi> and which we are convinced from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of, (which is no ſecret to the world) that tho' it may be uſeful in ſome caſes, it muſt be prejudicial in others; that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous, unlimited power of giving it, <hi>according to ſome,</hi> has to our knowledge, been productive of many, and great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages: How often has nature been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed, and a favourable criſis prevented by this, and other ill-timed medicines? And how eaſily diſtempers ſlight in themſelves, are often converted into important ones, by <hi>untimely</hi> and <hi>injudicious</hi> applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is well known to the careful obſerver. Caſes of this kind have occured where <hi>nature</hi> tho' feeble, and oppreſſed, yet labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard to relieve herſelf, and depurate the blood by critical ſwellings, has been moſt prepoſterouſly teized and thwarted with the ſtools, and ſweats, incited by this medicine, till ſhe had nigh ſunk under the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0001601000:45"/>oppreſſion; yet has ſhe at laſt happily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merged, and accompliſhed her deſigns, after having obtained a truce with it for a few days. So true is <hi>that</hi> obſervation of Dr. <hi>James</hi>* that <hi>ſome few</hi> are ſo happy in an <hi>unextinguiſhable</hi> ſtrength of conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they even at laſt miraculouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, <hi>notwithſtanding the moſt abſurd treatment.</hi> In colliquative caſes, where the ſecretions were too liberal, it has ſunk many untimely; and in fevers of ſeveral days ſtanding, where the veſſels are too tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid, the pulſe vehement, the blood ſo gluey and viſcid, that it cannot freely paſs the finer veſſels, or ſo fuſed, and broken, that it threatens to eſcape them; when inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations are alſo fixed on the nobler parts, foreboding inevitable deſtruction without ſpeedy relief; ſurely on ſuch emergencies, it would be madneſs <hi>indeed</hi> to truſt to this, or any one medicine, without calling in every other help, that reaſon, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience dictate on ſuch occaſions; and this we are juſtified in aſſerting, not from the<note place="bottom">James's Diſſert. on fevers, p. 5.</note>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0001601000:46"/>reaſon of the thing only, but from the authority likewiſe of Dr. <hi>James himſelf,</hi> in the places above cited.</p>
            <p>I cannot conclude without taking notice, of a ridiculous inſinuation, advanced <hi>by ſome,</hi> as a reaſon, why the gentlemen of the faculty do not patronize this medicine; which is, that it would be deſtructive of their private intereſts, by making ſuch ſpeedy cures. But this objection, the trite, and ſtale artifice of every empirick to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend his NOSTRUM, is as mean, and contemptible, as it is falſe; 'tis an artful lure, thrown out only as a decoy for the publick, that they may the more readily become their dupes.</p>
            <p>For are not the phyſicians of this nation in general, and of <hi>London</hi> in particular, men of liberal educations, whoſe learning, and abilities are equal to any in <hi>Europe?</hi> Are not many of them, as conſpicuous for their humanity, benevolence, and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as they are for their independant fortunes? What could induce ſuch men,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0001601000:47"/>to <hi>procraſtinate</hi> the cures of thoſe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their charge, but a certain conviction of the <hi>inefficacy,</hi> and <hi>incertitude,</hi> of <hi>general medicines?</hi> Is it not then baſe, and infamous, to inſinuate, that theſe men would ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice all conſiderations of <hi>honour, juſtice,</hi> and <hi>compaſſion,</hi> merely to oppoſe ſuch a univerſal medicine? Is it not notorious, that many of them in their private practice, as well as by repeated trials in our <hi>hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> have found it was by no means to be relied on? or can it deſerve credit from any ſenſible, and unprejudiced minds, that thoſe few practitioners <hi>who do</hi> eſpouſe this medicine, have <hi>alone</hi> monopolized the amiable qualities of truth, diſintereſtedneſs, and common honeſty? Surely it would be more ingenuous, and candid, to conclude, that nothing but this <hi>certain conviction</hi> of the <hi>incertitude,</hi> and <hi>inefficacy,</hi> of <hi>general me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,</hi> and of this in <hi>particular,</hi> (whoſe virtues like all others, can only ariſe, by being rationally adapted to <hi>particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and ſtates of diſeaſes</hi>) could be the true and only cauſe of leading phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to forbear its general uſe; whatever
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0001601000:48"/>bold aſſertions, ignorant, and deſigning men may advance to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Theſe are <hi>ſome</hi> of the obſervations, that have occured, and 'tis to be apprehended will have ſome weight with the impartial: for if neither <hi>honour, conſcience, humanity,</hi> and <hi>independance,</hi> can be thought to have any influence over the conduct, of ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of phyſic; we muſt be under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of condemning, a body of men, as monſters in nature, who have hitherto been eſteemed <hi>real ornaments</hi> to their country, and <hi>reſpectable,</hi> as well as <hi>uſeful</hi> members of ſociety.</p>

            <p n="33">33. Miſs. <hi>E.</hi> had no ſenſible operation with three doſes; was bled, had a bliſter put on her head, cataplaſms to her feet, a clyſter, and <hi>Glauber</hi> ſalts, which purged twice.</p>
            <p n="38">38. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> had a copious ſweat, for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hours; and three ſtools.</p>
            <p>Thus we may obſerve, that in eight caſes, <hi>the powder</hi> both <hi>vomited, purged,</hi> and <hi>ſweat;</hi> and theſe generally <hi>profuſe</hi> ſweats;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0001601000:53"/>
               <hi>pretty ſmart, conſiderable, and frequent</hi> purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and vomiting <hi>ſeveral times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſeven caſes, it operated by <hi>ſweats,</hi> and <hi>purging;</hi> ſometimes moderately, but in general <hi>profuſely,</hi> and <hi>conſiderably</hi> both ways.</p>
            <p>In three, it <hi>vomited</hi> and <hi>ſweated;</hi> and in three more, it <hi>ſweat only.</hi> Three alſo it <hi>vomited</hi> and <hi>purged,</hi> in one moderately, in the others, it vomited three or four times, and purged <hi>ſeveral;</hi> in one caſe it purged only, and in two had no operation at all.</p>
            <p>So that out of twenty ſeven caſes, it operated by ſtool in nineteen, and in ten of them <hi>ſmartly,</hi> and <hi>conſiderably.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the general effects and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which followed the taking <hi>this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,</hi> with ſometimes a copious ſediment in the urine; and may we not from hence fairly conclude, that in thoſe caſes, where <hi>vomiting, purging,</hi> and <hi>ſweating</hi> are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, (and many ſuch there are) that the uſe of <hi>this powder</hi> ſhould be ſuſpended? When the conſtitution alſo is lowered, or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0001601000:54"/>greatly reduced by the diſeaſe, may not the evacuations above mentioned, eſpecially when <hi>profuſe, ſmart,</hi> and <hi>frequent,</hi> in many caſes, precipitate the patient's fate? But if the indication be to <hi>ſweat, purge,</hi> or <hi>vomit</hi> ſingly, can we ever be ſure of anſwering any one of theſe intentions alone, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting others, we do not want, and which may prove of dangerous conſequence? Such ſeems to be the uncertainty of this medicine.</p>
            <p>When given in ſmall quantities, it poſſibly may be leſs hazardous, though perhaps leſs efficacious, as ſome <hi>operation</hi> ſeems always expected from it. But as Dr. <hi>James</hi> has not yet thought proper, to furniſh us with caſes of this ſort, we ſhall for the preſent decline any further animadverſions: nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhould we have troubled the public with theſe, had we not thought they were become abſolutely neceſſary, both for the reputation of <hi>the medicine,</hi> as well as for the <hi>patient's</hi> ſafety.</p>
