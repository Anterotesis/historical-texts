            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE PUBLIC.</head>
            <p>WHEN the reasons which have occasioned the necessity of the present plan, are shortly stated, the friends of Mr. MACKLIN are willing to persuade themselves, that proposals for a Subscription will not be unwelcome to the Public. Dr. JOHNSON observed, on a similar occasion, that,
<q>"To assist industrious indigence, struggling with distress, and debilitated by age, is a display of virtue, and an acquisition of happiness and honour."</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE present address is an appeal to the humanity and generosity of a large and opulent community, in behalf of a Man, who has lived to the age of NINETY TWO, and of that long life has passed near SEVENTY YEARS, under the eye of the public, at all times diligent in his business, and now a worn-out Veteran in the service of the Drama.</p>
            <p>BLESSED with uncommon vigour of constitution, Mr. MACKLIN hoped that his industry and indefatigable pains would have held him above want to the end of his life. But the decay of his memory has deprived him of all hopes of appearing again in that profession, which he always loved, and before that public, whom he honoured, for the generous encouragement, with which his exertions have been always distinguished.</p>
            <p>IT is now near three years since he first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the middle of his part, on Covent Garden Stage, a sudden failure of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. He has lived from that time in hopes of recovering his faculties; but his hopes have been too san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine, and he now feels with regret, that he can never again have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of presenting himself before a British Audience.</p>
            <p>IT is for this reason, that his friends presume to make this application. The two pieces, on which the applause of numerous audiences has stamped a value, were never printed, and as Mr. MACKLIN's memory has so far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted him, as to render those productions of no further use to him, it has been agreed, at a meeting of his friends, to offer them to the public by Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1017801400:3"/>THE EDITOR has most cheerfully undertaken the office of superintending the press, for a disabled Performer, whom he has known during a number of years, and whom he always respected for his professional talents. He would take the liberty to add more, were he not restrained by Mr. MACKLIN, who says,
<q>"That he has not lived an inattentive observer of the public mind, and therefore desires that his case, without further solicitation, may be left to the generosity of such, as are willing to relieve the languor of age, and the pains of disease, and indigence."</q>
            </p>
            <p>N. B. Dr. BROCKLESBY, JOHN PALMER, Esq. of the <hi>Post Office,</hi> and THOMAS LONGMAN, Esq. of Paternoster-Row, have undertaken, as TRUSTEES, to receive the amount of the Subscription, and to vest the same in such manner, as will carry into execution the intention of the Subscribers, for Mr. MACKLIN's Benefit.</p>
