            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS I perceive by the tenor of your pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications, that you chiefly
aim at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of youth, if the following Letters are thought any-way
conducive to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, you have my permiſſion to print them.</p>
            <p>The firſt fifty-one letters ending with theſe words 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>—avenged them of their
enemies—</hi>
               </q>were written by a Nobleman to his ſon, at the
uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. The reſt are added, as you will eaſily perceive, by a much
inferior hand; for they were drawn up by me. This I ſhould not have
attempted, but that the deſign would otherwiſe have been defective. With
regard to my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, therefore, little elſe can be ſaid, but that I have
endeavoured, as much as was in my power, to imitate the original. As to his
Lordſhip's, I think it may be aſſerted, that they are written with more
judgment, ſpirit, and accuracy than any which have yet appeared upon this
ſubject. I am conſcious, indeed, that they have been, for ſome time,
handed about in manuſcript; but, it is preſumed that this will not make a
publication of them leſs acceptable, even to thoſe who are
poſſeſſed of a written copy.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved in the ſchools about town, that, when
maſters ſet their ſcholars to read the hiſtory of England, they ſeem
at a loſs in <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0443100201:3"/> their choice of an hiſtorian. The more
volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous works of this kind are quite unſuited to a juvenile capacity; the
ſhorter abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are chiefly a crouded collection of facts, totally dry
and unentertaining. Theſe letters may, probably, ſupply the defect; and I
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that the volumes may be ſent, at my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, to each of the
ſchools mentioned in the incloſed paper.</p>

               <salute>Dear Charles,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE accounts I receive from Mr. your tutor, at Oxford, of your
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and capacity, give me equal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, both as a father and as a
man. I own myſelf happy, in thinking that ſociety will one day reap the
advantage of your improved abilities; but I confeſs myſelf vain when I
reflect on the care I have taken, and the honour I ſhall perhaps obtain from
aſſiſting their cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0443100201:5"/> Yes, my Charles,
ſelf-intereſt thus mixes with almoſt every virtue; my paternal vanity is,
perhaps, greater than my regards for ſociety in the preſent inſtance; but
you ſhould conſider that the bad pride themſelves in their folly, but
good minds alone are vain of their virtues.</p>
            <p>I need ſcarcely repeat what I have ſo often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that
your aſſiduity for a few years, in the early period of life, will give
eaſe and happineſs to the ſucceeding: a life ſpent in regularity and
ſtudy, in college, will not only furniſh the mind with proper materials,
but fit it, by habit, for future felicity. Mathematics will teach you to think
with cloſeneſs and preciſion, and the ancient poets will enlarge the
imagination; from theſe two helps, and not from the ſubtleties of logic or
metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſpeculation, the mind is at once ſtrengthened and improved;
logic or metaphyſics may give the theory of reaſoning, but it is poetry and
mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics, though ſeemingly oppoſite, that practically improve us in
every rational enquiry.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the ſtudies I recommended as princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally conducive
to your improvement, and your letters alone are ſufficient inſtances of
your comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my advice. I confeſs I fear giving any future
inſtructions on ſuch topics to one who ſeems better converſant with
them than his inſtructor, and muſt leave a ſubject, where my
ſuperiority at leaſt may be conteſted.</p>
            <p>But after all, my child, theſe ſtudies are at beſt but
ornaments of the mind, deſigned rather to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh or to fit it for higher
improvements, than as materials to be employed in guiding our conduct as
individuals, or members of ſociety. There is a field that, in ſome
meaſure, ſtill lies untrodden before you, and from that alone true wiſdom
and <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0443100201:6"/> real improvement can be expected, I mean hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
from hiſtory, in a great meaſure, every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that improves the
gentleman, or confirms the patriot, can be hoped for; it is that which muſt
qualify you for becoming a proper member of the community, for filling that
ſtation, in which you may hereafter be placed, with honour; and for giving,
as well as deriving, new luſtre from that illuſtrious aſſembly, to
which, upon my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, you have a right to be called.</p>
            <p>Yet, ſtill, nothing can be more uſeleſs than hiſtory, in the
manner in which it is generally ſtudied, where the memory is loaded with
little more than dates, names, and events. Simply to repeat the tranſaction
is thought ſufficient for every purpoſe, and the youth, who is applauded
for his readineſs in this way, fancies himſelf a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hiſtorian. But
the true uſe of hiſtory does not conſiſt in being able to ſettle a
genealogy, in knowing the events of an obſcure reign, or the true epoch of a
conteſted birth; this knowledge of facts hardly deſerves the name of
ſcience: true wiſdom conſiſts in tracing effects from their cauſes.
To underſtand hiſtory is to underſtand man, who is the ſubject. To
ſtudy hiſtory is to weigh the motives, the opinions, the paſſions of
mankind, in order to avoid a ſimilitude of error in ourſelves, or profit by
the wiſdom of their example.</p>
            <p>To ſtudy hiſtory in this manner may be begun at any age.
Children can never be too ſoon treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as men. Thoſe maſters, who
alledge the inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of tender youth, only tacitly reproach their own:
theſe who are incapable of teaching young minds to reaſon, pretend that it
is impoſſible. The truth is, they are fonder of making their pupils talk
well than think well, and much the greater <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0443100201:7"/> number are better
qualified to give praiſe to a ready memory than a ſound judgment. The
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of mankind conſider a multitude of facts as the real food of the
mind, not as ſubjects proper to afford it exerciſe. From hence it proceeds,
that hiſtory, inſtead of teaching us to know ourſelves, often only
ſerves to raiſe our vanity, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of the ignorant; or, what is
more dangerous, by the ſelf-deluſion of untried vanity.</p>
            <p>Aſſuming ignorance is, of all ſituations, the moſt
ridiculous: for, in the ſame proportion as the real man of wiſdom is
preferable to the unlettered ruſtic, ſo much is the ruſtic ſuperior to
him, who without learning imagines himſelf learned. Better that ſuch a man
had never read, for then he might be conſcious of his weakneſs; but the
half-learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, relying upon his ſtrength, ſeldom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives his wants
till he finds his deception paſt a cure.</p>
            <p>Your labours in hiſtory have hitherto been ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confined to the
words, than the facts, of your hiſtorical guides. You have read Xenophon or
Livy, rather with a view of learning the dead lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages in which they are
written, than of profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the inſtructions which they afford; the time
is now come to diſcontinue the ſtudy of words for things, for exerciſing
your judgment, and giving more room to reaſon than the fancy.</p>
            <p>Above all things, I would adviſe you to conſult the original
hiſtorians in every relation. Abridgers, compilers, commentators, and
critics, are in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral only fit to fill the mind with unneceſſary
anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes, or lead its reſearches aſtray. In the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of various
relations, your care muſt be to ſelect ſuch as deſerve to be known,
becauſe they ſerve to inſtruct: the end of your labour ſhould 
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0443100201:8"/> not be to know in what year fools or ſavages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
their extravagances, but by what methods they emerged from barbarity. The
ſame neceſſity there is for knowing the actions of the worthy part of
princes, alſo compels us to endeavour to forget thoſe of the ignorant and
vulgar herd of kings, who ſeemed only to ſlumber in a ſeat they were
accidentally called to fill. In ſhort, not the hiſtory of kings, but of
man, ſhould be your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal concern, and ſuch an hiſtory is only to be
acquired by conſulting thoſe originals who paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the times they lived
in. Their ſucceſſors, who pretended to methodize their hiſtories, have
almoſt univerſally deprived them of all their ſpirit, and given us rather
a dry catalogue of names, than afforded an opportunity for improving
reflexion.</p>
            <p>Hiſtory, in general, is precious or inſignificant; not from the
brilliancy of the events, the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the adventures, or the
greatneſs of the perſonages concerned, but from the ſkill, penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and judgment of the obſerver. Tacitus fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently complains of his want of
materials, of the littleneſs of his incidents, of the weakneſs and villainy
of his actors; yet, even from ſuch indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſubjects, he has wrought
out the moſt pleaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the moſt inſtructive hiſtory that ever was
written; it will therefore be entirely the work of your own judgment to convert
the generality of hiſtorians to your benefit; they are, at preſent, but
rude materials, and require a fine diſcernment to ſeparate the uſeful
from the unneceſſary, and analyſe their different principles.</p>
            <p>Yet, miſtake me not, I would not have hiſtory to conſiſt of
dry ſpeculations upon facts, told with phlegm, and purſued without
intereſt and paſſion; nor would I have your reaſon fatigued continually
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0443100201:9"/> in critical reſearch; all I require is, that the
hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian would give as much exerciſe to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the
imagination: it is as much his duty to act the philoſopher, or politician, in
his narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, as to collect materials for narration. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a
philoſophical ſkill in diſcerning, his very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative muſt be
frequently falſe, fabulous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory: without political ſagacity,
his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters muſt be ill drawn, and vice and virtue be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
without diſcernment or candour.</p>
            <p>What hiſtorian can render virtue ſo amiable as Xenophon? Who can
intereſt the reader ſo much as Livy? Saluſt is an inſtance of the
moſt delicate exactneſs, and Tacitus of the moſt ſolid reflexion: from
a perfect acquaintance with theſe, the youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtudent can acquire more
knowlege of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, a more perfect acquaintance with antiquity, and a more
juſt manner of thinking and expreſſion, than, perhaps; from any others of
any age or country. Other ancient hiſtorians may be read to advance your
ſtudy in ancient learning, but theſe ſhould be the ground-work of all
your reſearches. Without a previous acquaintance with theſe, you enter upon
other writers improperly prepared; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til theſe have placed you in a proper
train of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralizing the incidents, other hiſtorians may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, injure,
but will not improve you. Let me therefore, at preſent, my dear Charles,
intreat you to beſtow the proper care upon thoſe treaſures of antiquity,
and by your letters, every poſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to your father, your friend,
the reſult of your reflexions upon them. I am at a loſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhall
find more ſatisfaction in hearing your remarks, or communicating my own?
However, in which ſoever of them I ſhall be employed, it will make my
higheſt amuſement; amuſement is <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0443100201:10"/> all that I can now
expect in this life, for ambition has long forſaken me; and, perhaps, my
child, after all, that what your noble anceſtor obſerved is moſt true: 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>When all is done, human life is, at the
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and the beſt, but like a froward child, that muſt be played
with and humoured a little to keep it quiet till it falls aſleep, and then
the care is over. I am, my dear boy, your moſt tender friend and affectionate

            <p>IENTIRELY acquieſce in your ſentiments, that univerſal
hiſtory is a ſubject too extenſive for human comprehenſion, and that he
who would really reap its advantages muſt be contented to bound his views.
Satisfied with being ſuperficial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with the tranſactions of
many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, he ſhould place his attention only on a few. Your remarks on
the Greek and Roman republics far ſurpaſs my expectations; you have
juſtly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized them as the fineſt inſtances of political
ſociety, that could be founded on the baſis of a falſe religion. Where
religion is imperfect, poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſociety, and all laws enacted for its
improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt be imperfect alſo; religion is but phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
refined, and no man could ever boaſt an excellence in politics, whoſe mind

            <p>Forgive me, dear Charles, if I once more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate myſelf upon
the pleaſure I expect from <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0443100201:11"/> your future eminence; you are
now tinctured with univerſal hiſtory, and are thoroughly converſant with
that of Greece and Rome; but there is another department of hiſtory ſtill
remaining, and that much more important than any I have yet men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I mean
the HISTORY OF ENGLAND. The hiſtory of this country is the proper ſtudy of
an Engliſhman: however, it peculiarly concerns thoſe who may, like you,
probably one day have ſuch an important character to ſupport in its
adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and whoſe name, perhaps, may find a place in the
hiſtoric page. All who are inamoured of the liberty and the happineſs which
they, peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy, in this happy region, muſt ſurely be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of knowing the methods by which ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages were acquired; the
progreſſive ſteps from barbarity to ſocial refinement, from ſociety
to the higheſt pitch of well conſtituted freedom. All Europe ſtands in
aſtoniſnment at the wiſdom of our conſtitution, and it would argue the
higheſt degree of inſenſibility in a native of this country, and one too
who from his birth enjoys peculiar privileges, to be ignorant of what others
ſo much admire.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not inſiſt upon a principal uſe, to which ſome
apply the Engliſh hiſtory, I mean that of making it the topic of common
converſation; yet, even from ſuch a motive, though in itſelf trifling, no
well-bred man can plead ignorance: its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advantage, however, is, that
a knowledge of the paſt enables the attentive mind to underſtand the
preſent: our laws, cuſtoms, liberties; abuſe of liberty can ſcarcely be
underſtood without tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them to their ſource, and hiſtory is the only
channel by which we can arrive at what we ſo eagerly purſue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0443100201:12"/> But were I to compare the hiſtory of our own
country, in point of amuſement, with that of others, I know of none, either
ancient or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, that can vie with it in this reſpect; in other
hiſtories, remote and extenſive connexions interrupt the reader's
intereſt, and deſtroy the ſimplicity of the plan: the hiſtory of Greece
may be eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſeven different hiſtories, and into ſo
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it has actually been: the hiſtory of Rome, from the time it begins to
be authentic, is little elſe than an account of the then known world; but, in
England, ſeparated, by its ſituation, from the continent, the reader may
conſider the whole nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, with all its viciffitudes, in one point of
view; it unites the philoſopher's<note n="†" place="margin">Hutcheſon.</note> definition of beauty, by being <hi>variouſly
uniform.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The materials for an hiſtory of our own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are therefore
excellent, but I can direct to few who have improved them with a proper degree
of aſſiduity or ſkill. The hiſtorians, who have treated of this
ſubject, have in general written for a party, many with an open avowal of
virulence and abuſe. Some, who have had talents for this undertaking, were
unable to afford themſelves ſufficient leiſure to poliſh their work
into the degree of requiſite perfection; while others, who have laboured with
ſufficient aſſiduity, have been woefully deficient in point of
ſagacity, or proper ſkill in the choice of thoſe facts they thought
proper to relate. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has been known, and not what was worth knowing, has
been faithfully tranſcribed, ſo that the preſent accounts of the country
reſemble the ancient face of the ſoil; here an uncultivated fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
there a deſolate wild, and, in a very few <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0443100201:13"/> places, a
ſpot of earth adorned by art, and ſmiling with all the luxuriance of
nature. To make hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory like the ſoil truly uſeful, the obſtacles to
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement muſt be torn away, new aſſiſtances muſt be acquired from
art, nor can the work be deemed properly finiſhed, till the whole puts on
ſimplicity, uniformity, and elegance: as the caſe is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, we
muſt read a library, to acquire a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Engliſh hiſtory; and,
after all, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to forget more than we remember.</p>
            <p>The hiſtory of England may be divided, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, into
three periods; with regard to their duration, indeed, very different, but
almoſt of equal importance. The firſt is from the commencement of our
knowledge of the country to its conqueſt by the Norman; the ſecond, from
the time of William the Conqueror to the alteration of the conſtitution, by
the beheading King Charles I; the laſt contains the remaining period of
Engliſh hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. It will at once appear, that ſuch a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is
extremely unequal: the firſt department may be ſaid to extend to a period
of more than a thouſand years; the ſecond contains not leſs than ſeven
hundred, while the remaining does not take up two. Chronologiſts, indeed,
would divide it in a very different manner; however, I am rather inclined to
this diviſion, more by the peculiar uſe which may be made of each period,
than the mere regularity of time. To conſider the firſt part, with
accuracy, belongs properly to the philoſopher; the ſecond is the
buſineſs of him who would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand our conſtitution, and is the
proper ſtudy of a legiſlator; and the laſt of ſuch as would be
acquainted with the connexions and relations in which we ſtand with regard to
our neighbours of <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0443100201:14"/> the continent, and our foreign and
domeſtic trade, namely to the merchant and politician.</p>
            <p>There is ſcarce any other paſſion, but that of curioſity,
excited by a knowledge of the early part of our hiſtory. We may go through
the account of that diſtant aera, with the ſame impartiality with which we
conſider the original inhabitants of any other country, as the cuſtoms of
our Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh anceſtors have no connexion with our own. But then, to ſome
minds, it muſt be a pleaſing diſquiſition to obſerve the human
animal, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, diveſting himſelf of his native ferocity, and
acquiring the arts of happineſs and peace; to trace the ſteps, by which he
leaves his precarious meal, acquired by the chace, for a more certain, but a
more laborious, repaſt, acquired by cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>After the conqueſt, the rude outlines of our preſent
conſtitution began to be formed. Before the Norman invaſion, there might be
ſome cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms reſembling thoſe at preſent in practice; but the only
reaſon of their continuance was, becauſe they had before been practiſed
in common among the invaders. At this period, therefore, an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman
becomes intereſted in the narrative; he perceives the riſe and the
reaſons for ſeveral laws, which now ſerve to reſtrain his own conduct,
or preſerve his property. The rights of our monarchs, the claims of foreign
potentates, the ineffectual ſtruggles for liberty, and the gradual
incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ambition, ſhould highly intereſt him, as he in ſome
meaſure owes to theſe tranſactions the happineſs he enjoys.</p>
            <p>But the laſt period is what is chiefly incumbent upon almoſt
every man to be particularly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0443100201:15"/> in. Every
perſon, reſiding here, has a ſhare in the liberties of this kingdom; and
the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the people are ultimately inveſted with the legiſlation.
It is therefore each man's duty to know that conſtitution, which, by his
birth-right, he is called to govern; a freeholder, in a free kingdom, ſhould
certainly be inſtructed in the original of that agreement, by which he holds
ſo precious a tenure.</p>
            <p>Theſe are motives that equally influence almoſt every rank of
people, but how much more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſhould they operate upon you, whoſe
honours, whoſe truſts, and poſſeſſions, are likely to be ſo
conſiderable. Others may have their liberties to ſupport; you muſt
ſuſtain your liberty, your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and the dignity of your ſtation. I
ſhall therefore, without farther preface, in ſome future correſpondence,
communicate the reſult of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries on this ſubject; a ſubject which,
I own, has employed all the leiſure I had to ſpare from, I will not ſay
more-important, but more neceſſary duties. I ſhall endeavour, at once, to
ſupply the facts, and the neceſſary conſequences that may be deduced
from them. I ſhall ſeparate all that can contribute nothing, either for
amuſement or uſe, and. leave ſuch to dull compilers, or ſyſtematic
writers of hiſtory, whoſe only boaſt it is <hi>to leave nothing out.</hi>
A more thorough knowledge of the ſubject can not be communicated, without
pain, nor acquired without ſtudy; perhaps too minute a ſkill in this, or
any one ſubject, might diſqualify the mind for other branches of ſcience,
equally demanding your care. Of whatever uſe it may be, I hope you will
conſider it as an inſtance of my regard, and, though it ſhould fail to
improve, <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0443100201:16"/> yet I hope it may remain a ſufficient
teſtimony, how much I am,</p>

            <p>THERE ſeems to be a natural tendency, in every nation, to run its
antiquity as far back as poſſible, and when once they have arrived at the
regions of fiction, no bounds are ſet to the wonders of every narration. Were
we to take our character of the ancient inhabitants of this iſland, from the
legends, monuments, or traditions, which have been left by thoſe inhabitants
themſelves, we might be apt to imagine that arts, even in that early pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
were cultivated, and ſciences known to ſome degree of perfection. The
Druids, if we believe ſome fragments of their own, underſtood aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and medicine, and gave leſſions in morality and metaphyſics. But what
credit can be given to the accounts of a barbarous people, told by
themſelves? The knowledge and learning, indeed, of their prieſts, might be
great, if compared with the almoſt brutal ſimplicity and ignorance of the
reſt of the people; but it could not deſerve the name of ſcience, if put
in competition with what was known and practiſed by their polite
cotempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries of Greece and Rome.</p>
            <p>From the accounts of thoſe ſenſible writers, and not from the
fictitious abſurdities of the Druids themſelves, we are to eſtimate this
ancient people of Britain. All that we find related by credible witneſſes
and ſufficient authority, before the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0443100201:17"/> entered
this iſland, is, that the country was filled with incredible numbers of
people, and their fields ſtored with great plenty of animals, ſavage and
domeſtic. Their houſes were meanly built, and ſcattered, as if
accidentally, over the country, without obſervance, diſtance, or order. The
only motives of their choice were the peculiar fertility of ſome happy
ſpot, or the convenience of wood and water. They lived upon milk, and fleſh
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by the chace, for corn was ſcarcely known among them. What cloaths
they wore were ſkins of beaſts, but a great part of their bodies was left
always expoſed to the injuries of the weather; all that was naked being
painted with blue. This cuſtom of painting was univerſal among them, either
in order to ſtrike terror into their enemies, or to defend the pores of the
naked ſkin from the viciſſitudes of the ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Their towns, if a collection of huts could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that name,
were moſtly built upon the coaſts, in ſuch places as ſtrangers
generally reſorted to for the ſake of commerce. The commodities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
were chiefly hides and tin, and, probably, other ſpontaneous productions of
the ſoil, which required no art in the preparation.</p>
            <p>Their government, like that of the ancient Gauls, conſiſted of
ſeveral petty principalities, which ſeem to be the original governments of
mankind, and deduced from the natural right of paternal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion: but whether
theſe little principalities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended by ſucceſſion, or were elected
by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people, is not recorded. Upon great or uncommon
dangers, indeed, the chief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of all their forces was choſen by
common conſent, in a general aſſembly, as Caeſar relates of
Caſſibelaunus, upon his invaſion. The ſame was <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0443100201:18"/>
done upon their revolts againſt the Roman colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, under Caractacus and
their Queen Boadicea; for, among them, women were admitted to their
principalities, and general commands, by the right of ſucceſſion, merit,
or nobility.</p>
            <p>Such were the cuſtoms of the ancient Britons, and the ſame may
ſerve for a deſcription of every other barbarous nation, of which we have
any knowledge. Savage man, is an animal in almoſt every country the ſame;
and all the difference between nations reſults from cuſtoms introduced by
luxury, or cultivated by refinement. What the inhabitant of Britain was at that
time, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of South America, or Cafraria, may be at this day. But
there was one cuſtom, among the ancient inhabitants of this iſland, which
ſeems pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to themſelves, and is not to be found in the accounts of
any other ancient or modern nation. The cuſtom I mean, was a community of
wives, among certain numbers, and by common conſent. Every man married indeed
but one woman, who was always after, and alone, eſteemed his wife: but, it
was uſual for five or ſix, ten, twelve, or more, either brothers or
friends, as they could agree, to have all their wives in common. But this,
though calculated for their mutual happineſs, in fact proved their greateſt
diſturbance; and we have ſome inſtances, in which this community of wives
produced diſſenſions, jealouſies, and death. Every woman's children,
however, were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of him who had married her; but all claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a
ſhare in the care and defence of the whole ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, ſince no man knew
which were his own.</p>
            <p>To eſtimate the wiſdom of the people, we muſt examine the
manners of their teachers. If the laity were ſo very barbarous, the Druids,
their <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0443100201:19"/> inſtructors, muſt have but few pretences to
ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior refinement. Yet, I know not how, we have different and almoſt
contradictory accounts of this extraordinary fraternity. They have been
repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, by ſome, as perſons of learning, which had been derived to
them by long tradition. Their ſkill conſiſted in the obſervation of the
heavens, and, upon the influence of its appearance, they gave their countrymen
omens of failure or ſucceſs. They taught a morality, which principally
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in juſtice and fortitude. Their lives were ſimple and
innocent, in woods, caverns, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low trees; their food acorns or berries,
and their drink water. They were reſpected and admired, not only for knowing
more than other men, but for deſpiſing what all others valued and
purſued; by their virtue and temperance, they reproved and corrected thoſe
vices in others, from which they were themſelves happily free; and made uſe
of no other arms, than the reverence due to integrity, to enforce obedience to
their own commands. From ſuch a conduct as this, they derived ſo much
authority, that they were not only prieſts, but judges alſo, throughout the
nation. No laws were inſtituted without their approbation; no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
puniſhed with bonds, or death, but by their condemnation.</p>
            <p>But, on the other hand, we learn, that all their knowledge was
impoſture, and their ſimplicity on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſavage paſſion for
ſolitude. Their language was barbarous, and their manners ſtill more rude.
Theſe were ſuch as called aloud for ſome more enlightened inſtructors,
to conquer and to direct them. The Druids, ſeemingly formed for the people
among whom they governed, ſacrificed human victims, which they burned in
large wicker <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0443100201:20"/> idols, which were made ſo capacious, as to
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a multitude of perſons, who were, in this manner, at once conſumed
in the flames. The female Druids plunged their knives in the breaſts of the
priſoners taken in war, and propheſied from the manner in which the blood
happened to ſtream from the wound. Several of their altars, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of
four broad ſtones, three of which were ſet edgewiſe, and the fourth
horizontally on the top, and are ſtill to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>In accounts, ſo ſeemingly contradictory, we are entirely to give
aſſent to neither. That they pretended to aſtrology is certain; this, and
not their piety, probably gave them ſuch influence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their countrymen.
To judge of what the Britons then were, as I have already hinted, we muſt
look at what ſavage nations are at preſent: We perceive, what authority a
pretence to aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, in barbarous countries, confers; the aſtrologer
being generally conſidered, in almoſt all the Eaſtern kingdoms, as the
ſecond, if not the firſt man of the ſtate. That the Druids deceived the
people with a falſe religion cannot be denied, but, yet, I can never think
that they were impoſtors: they firſt deceived themſelves into a belief
and veneration of what they taught, and then made uſe of every motive to
perſuade the people. The ignorant and erroneous, in the commerce of this
life, are many; the villains and impoſtors are found more rarely. As for
human ſacrifices, few probably were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed upon this horrid occaſion,
but priſoners taken in war, and ſuch have ever been ſacrificed, by
ſavage nations, rather from a principle of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, than religion. It is not
peculiar to the religion of the Druids alone, but was primarily the 
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0443100201:21"/> barbarous practice of thoſe very nations who then
exclaimed againſt it moſt loudly.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, my dear Charles, the religion of the Druids was no more
than that of every barbarous nation, with whoſe ceremonies we have any
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. This was the religion, not only practiſed in Britain, but
which prevailed, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, over the greateſt part of the world. The
original inhabitants of Europe, as a learned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary<note n="*" place="bottom">Mountfaucon.</note> has finely proved, were the ſame: all
ſpeaking one language, obeying the ſame deities, and governed by ſimilar
laws. Succeſſive inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, from different parts of Aſra, brought new
changes; and, as the colonies went weſtward, the Greek, the Roman, and
Teutonic languages and cuſtoms were ſuper-induced over the ancient Celtic.
All thoſe countries, moſt acceſſible to ſtrangers, or moſt
ſubject to invaſions, were firſt changed; thoſe which lay ſurrounded
by mountains, or were in ſome meaſure retired by their ſituation, ſuch
as Wales, the Highlands of Scotland, Ireland, Biſcay, Crim Tartary, &amp;c.
all preſerved their primitive manners. It is even found, that theſe
countries ſtill adhere to many of the ancient Druidical cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, as far as
the alteration of religion will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. We have, as yet, an opportunity of
view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of their ancient, and, in ſome meaſure, venerable
ſuperſtitions, ſtill in Ireland: theſe are, however, wearing out by
degrees, and another century will entirely efface every veſtige of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
antiquity. I am,</p>

            <p>IT is, in ſome meaſure, happy for a barbarous people to be
conquered by a country more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite than themſelves. Whatever evils the
ambition of heroes generally produces, it is attended with one advantage, that
of diſſeminating arts, and making humanity more extenſive. The Britons,
ſavage and rude as they were, in ſome meaſure, called for more polite
inſtructors, and the Romans, of all the conquerors hiſtory can produce,
were at once the moſt polite, the moſt generous, and humane.</p>
            <p>A country, divided like Britain into a variety of ſmall
principalities, muſt neceſſarily have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated into various, and
often oppoſite, intereſts. Its princes muſt have been frequently at war,
merely for the ſake of plunder, to keep their troops in exerciſe, or to
gratify vanity and ambition. We may eaſily, therefore, form an idea of the
miſeries of a rude people, who had nothing but fear to keep them from war
with each other, and who could build no longer on a laſting peace, than while
they avoided giving an opportunity of plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their enemies.</p>
            <p>To complete the picture of the calamities of this people, all the
trading and maritime towns, next the continent, were in poſſeſſion of
foreign invaders long before the Romans entered the iſland. Theſe were a
people who had been received from motives of hoſpitality, and who, under the
character of exiles in diſtreſs, having got footing and ſhelter amongſt
the natives, afterwards made war upon them, as enemies. This, added to their
frequent tumults and maſſacres among each other, <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0443100201:23"/>
rendered them, not only internally unhappy, but an eaſy prey to every
invader. Beſides, they were ill ſupplied with arms, and thoſe they had
were only ſuch as were no longer in uſe among the refined na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the
continent. They fought in chariots armed with ſcythes, applied to the wheels.
Theſe were terrible without execution, and made rather to aſtoniſh the
rude and ignorant, than to break ſuch ranks, as were not to be daunted by the
mere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of danger. Their defenſive armour only conſiſted of a
wicker ſhield; and they approached an enemy ſhouting, claſhing their
arms, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their trumpets, as if they had a deſign rather to
terrify than deſtroy. Their chariots generally attacked the enemy's cavalry,
and from theſe they would frequently leap, and fight on foot, till, being
fatigued or overpowered, they would reſume their ſeats and make the beſt
retreat poſſible. Unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed nations, though they have more fierceneſs
in the onſet, never act with that cool preſevering reſolution, which
almoſt ever enſures victory. This can be acquired, only where diſcipline
and ſubordination have long prevailed; and a nation, however brave, levied in
haſte, will probably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make a figure againſt veteran troops, harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by contention, or elated by long ſucceſs. This was the nature of the
inhabitants, but the face of the country rendered them ſtill more open to
every invader. It was plain and open, without towns, fortreſſes, or any
place of retreat to ſecure them from an enemy, except what their foreſts
might happen to afford; in a word, they were deſtitute of all means of
defence, but what their native courage was able to ſupply, or a love of
liberty might inſpire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0443100201:24"/> Such were the people and cuſtoms of Britain,
when the Romans firſt invaded their iſland, under the enſigns of Julius
Caeſar, the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander that ever led an army. When I conſider
this great man, who had already been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror of Gaul; when I reflect on
his courage, his conduct, and perſeverance; when I take into my view the
troops he headed, inured to diſcipline, and fighting in a manner with which
barbarous nations were entirely unacquainted; when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe
circumſtances, and compare them with thoſe of the Britons in the ſame
period, I feel a more than uſual ſhare of ſurprize at the bravery and
conduct with which theſe poor barbarians op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him.</p>
            <p>It was an eſtabliſhed maxim, in the politics of Rome, to deem
all auxiliaries as principals, and to allow none to aſſiſt the enemies of
the ſtate with impunity. This was the pretence Caeſar laid hold of to
juſtify his invaſion of England, which was not only looked upon as an ally,
but likewiſe as an aſylum to the Gauliſh nations, which were at that time
enemies of Rome. This might, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, be the ground of his invaſion, but
the pleaſure of conqueſt was his real motive. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Roman empire,
though already it was become too extenſive to be governed, was at that time
thought the moſt glorious atchievment of humanity. The reſt of Europe was,
in ſome meaſure, ſubdued, and nothing left but countries deſolate by
foreſts and marſhes, and neither tempting, from their appearance, nor
affording any hopes of plunder, from their poverty. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſm was, at that
time, the boaſt of ambition, nor have men, till very lately, been taught to
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider conquerors with an eye of contempt or deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taticn. 
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0443100201:25"/> Caeſar was reſolved on being a hero, and was more fond
of triumph than juſtice.</p>
            <p>His forces were compoſed of Germans, Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians, and Gauls, and
the flower of his veteran Roman legions. He ſet ſail from Gaul about
midnight, and arrived on the Britiſh coaſt about

years before the Chriſtian aera. The Britons, with their naked troops, made a
brave oppoſition againſt this veteran army: the encounters between them
were fierce, and many, the loſſes were mutual, and the ſucceſs various.
Caſſibelaunus was choſen general in chief of the Britiſh forces, but
even a foreign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader was not ſufficient to keep the petty princes, which
compoſed the barbarous army, united. Diſſenſion ſoon entered
amongſt them, and ſome, jealous of the ſincerity of their general, or
envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his greatneſs, fled over to Caeſar, ſubmitted to the Romans, and
claimed their protection. Others followed this baſe example, till
Caſſibelaunus, weakened by ſo many deſertions, reſolved upon making
what terms he was able, while he had yet an opportunity. He ſends to
Caeſar, acknowledges the Romanpower, agrees upon a certain tribute, and
delivers hoſtages. Britain, from the beginning, has been remarkable for
internal diſſenſion, and diſſenſion ever ſtrengthens or invites
the invader.</p>
            <p>The Romans were pleaſed with the name of a new conqueſt, and
glad of ending an adventure with honour, which at firſt promiſed only
difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and danger. But the extended foreſt, and the trackleſs wild,
was not a quarry for men intent on ſpoil, and raiſed to greater
expectations. Having, therefore, rather diſcovered than ſubdued the
ſouthern parts of the iſland, they returned into Gaul with their whole
forces, and once more left <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0443100201:26"/> the Britons to their cuſtoms,
religion, and laws. By two expeditions which Caeſar made into this iſland,
he rather increaſed the glory than the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of Rome, and gave Britain
the honour of being the laſt triumph of that mighty republic, which had
before reduced the moſt powerful king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the habitable globe.</p>
            <p>Whatever the tribute was, which they had contracted annually to pay,
we have many reaſons, from hiſtory, to believe, they paid it but very
neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently. I mention this, as an inſtance of the little faith which can be
expected from an extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſubmiſſion, while there is no longer a power
to enforce obedience. During the reign of Auguſtus, that Emperor had formed a
deſign of viſiting Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but was diverted from it by an unexpected
revolt of the Pannonians. Some years after, he again reſumed his deſign,
but, being met in his way by the Britiſh ambaſſadors, promiſing the
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed tribute, and making the uſual ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, he a ſecond
time deſiſted. The year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, finding them unfaithful to their
promiſe, he prepared, a third time, for the invaſion of this iſland, but
was prevented from putting his deſign into execution, by their
ambaſſadors, who averted his fury by their adulations and humility. The
moſt ſavage countries underſtand flattery almoſt as well as the moſt
polite, ſince, to be ſufficiently ſervile is, perhaps, the whole of the
art, and the trueſt method of pleaſing.</p>
            <p>Tiberius followed the maxims of Auguſtus, and, wiſely judging
the Roman empire already too extenſive, made no attempt upon this iſland.
Some Roman ſoldiers being wrecked on the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh coaſt, the inhabitants
not only aſſiſted them with the greateſt humanity, but ſent them, in 
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0443100201:27"/> ſafety, back to their general. In conſequence of
ſuch friendly diſpoſitions, there was a conſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe between
the two nations; the principal Engliſh nobility reſorted to Rome, and
ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their education there.</p>
            <p>By theſe means the Britons began ſenſibly to improve. The
firſt art, which a ſavage people is generally taught by their politer
neighbours, is that of war. Tho' not wholly addicted to the Roman manner of
fighting, the Britons, however, adopted ſeveral of their improvements, both
in their arms, and their arrangement in the field. Their feroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to
ſtrangers was now alſo leſſened, and they firſt began to coin money,
the oldeſt Britiſh coin being that of Comius, who learned a part of the
Roman politeneſs by a reſidence in Caeſar's camp. They ſtill, however,
continued to live as herdſmen and hunters, and adhered to their uſual
ſuperſtitions, a manifeſt inſtance of the country being, as yet, but
thinly inhabited. When we read, in Caeſar, of the numbers of this people, and
the vaſt armies they brought into the field, I am apt to doubt his veracity.
Such armies could ſcarcely be levied, even now; and yet, nothing is more
certain, than that Britain is at leaſt ten times more populous now than it
was at that time. A nation of herdſmen and hunters can never be very
populous; their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence takes up a large tract of country, while the
huſbandman converts every part of nature to human uſe, and produces the
greateſt quantity of ſubſiſtence from circumſcribed
poſſeſſion. The Roman hiſtorian has increaſed their numbers, only
to increaſe the luſtre of his glory in ſubduing them. I am, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>THE ſecond expedition into Britain was made by Claudius, under the
conduct of Plautius, and purſued by Oſtorius, and other Roman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
with the uſual ſucceſs. It is true, there were many Britons who preferred
their hardy ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity to imported elegance, and, rather than offer their
necks to the Roman yoke, preſented their breaſts to the ſword. But, by
degrees, their fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was ſubdued, or wholly deſtroyed; the
ſouthern coaſt, with all the adjacent inland country, was ſecured by the
conquerors, who took poſſeſſion by fortifying camps, building
fortreſſes, and planting colonies. The reſt of the country ſeemed to
look on, patiently waiting till it became their turn to be expelled from their
precarious habitations, or to receive their imperious maſters.</p>
            <p>Proſperity, in general, breeds inſolence; the corruption of the
Praetors and officers, that were appointed to govern this harraſſed people,
once more rouſed them into reſentment. Caractacus, General and King of the
northern Britons, with inferior numbers, not only made a brave defence, but
often ſeemed to claim a doubtful victory. A drawn battle might be
conſidered as a triumph, to a people only uſed to a defeat. He continued
nine years to hold out, and threatened fatal dangers to the Roman colonies. At
length, however, in a deciſive battle, the Britons were totally defeated, and
Caractacus taken priſoner. His exclamation, when led in triumph through Rome,
is too remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be paſſed over in ſilence. Obſerving the
opulence, ſplendor, and luxury of that great city, <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0443100201:29"/> 
               <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Alas!</hi> cried he, <hi>how is it poſſible,
that people, poſſeſſed of ſuch finery at home, could envy me an
humble cottage in Britain?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, one expiring effort more was made by the Britons, to recover
their liberty in the times of Nero. Paulinus, the general of the Romans, going
with the greateſt part of his forces, to ſubdue the iſle of Angleſey,
where the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Druids were ſtill practiſed with all
their horrid circumſtances; the Britons, preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his abſence,
made a general inſurrection under Boadicea, Queen of the Iceni, whom the
Romans had treated with ſhocking indignities, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning her, for ſome
ſlight offence, to be whipped, and her daughters to be raviſhed by the
ſoldiery: in revenge, therefore, at the head of a numerous army, ſhe fell
upon the Romans wherever they were defenceleſs, took their caſtles,
deſtroyed the chief ſeats of their power at London and Veru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam, and,
ſuch was the ſlaughter, that ſeventy thouſand fell by this revolt.
Paulinus, however, ſoon returned with his army, encountered the Britiſh
forces headed by their Queen, overthrew their powers, and purſued his victory
with a ſlaughter of eighty thouſand men, while the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Queen
poiſoned herſelf in deſpair. Here ended the liberties of Britain. All
that now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained were ſatisfied to exchange freedom for life: this was
their laſt ſtruggle; they now loſt, not only the hopes, but even the
deſire of vindicating the privileges of nature</p>
            <p>From this time the Romans ſeemed more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of ſecuring
what they poſſeſſed, than of making new conqueſts; they ſeparated
the Roman province, by a wall, from the Picts, their barbarous and reſtleſs
neighbours; and attempted to humanize the <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0443100201:30"/> fierceneſs of
thoſe who acknowledged their power. The Roman laws and cuſtoms, habits and
arms, language and manners, baths and feaſts, ſtudies and learning, were
introduced and became gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. A conduct ſo prudent, which had been firſt
begun by Agricola, was purſued by his ſucceſſors with ſo much
ſucceſs, that the Romans had little trouble afterwards in Britain, except
in the defence of their northern frontier.</p>
            <p>Had Rome continued peaceable miſtreſs of the world, the Britons,
now almoſt perfectly civilized, might have found means of being happy. But,
upon the diviſions in the Roman empire, which was ruled by faction, and
governed by an inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſoldiery, torn by ſedition at home, and
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to invaſion abroad, the Britiſh legions were, at ſeveral
times, called over into Gaul, and, with them, great numbers of the braveſt of
the Britiſh youth. Thus, we ſee every method purſued, to weaken and
render this once hardy people effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate. The arts of luxury were introduced
to ſoften their minds; they were denied the uſe of arms, which might
ſtill uphold their native brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; the flower of their youth were, at
intervals, drained away, and thoſe that remained were bred up in ſervitude
and ſubjection. All thoſe who had a paſſion for liberty, were long
ſince deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and none were ſuffered to live, but ſuch as had
betrayed their country in the beginning, or had been too cowardly to reſiſt
any unjuſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion. It is no wonder, therefore, that, as the Roman forces
decreaſed in Britain, the Picts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more bold in their incurſions.
Theſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably were the deſcendants of ſuch Britons as once bravely
exchanged their country for freedom, and croſſing the narrow ſea, which
the Romans <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0443100201:31"/> could not guard, in little boats of wicker
covered with leather, they filled the country, wherever they came, with
ſpoil, ſlaughter, and deſolation: when repulſed, by ſuperior numbers,
they uſually retired, loaded with ſpoils, and watched for the next
opportunity of invaſion, when the Romans were drawn away into the remoter
parts of the iſland.</p>
            <p>Theſe enterprizes were often repeated, and as often repreſſed,
till, in the reign of Valentinian the younger, the empire of Rome began to
trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for its capital. Myriads of barbarous nations, under the names of
Goths and Vandals, invaded the dominion of this miſtreſs of the world, with
terror, perſeverance, and rapidity. All the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man legions were now,
therefore, drawn from Britain, and all the Britons, who were fit for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
ſervice, were brought away to relieve the Emperor, who was purſued by the
Goths into Piedmont, and there beſieged in Aquilea, a town he attempted to
defend.</p>
            <p>The Romans, now taking their laſt leave of this province, left the
Britons to their own go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the choice of their own Kings. For the
exerciſe of their arms, and for repairing their ramparts, they gave them the
beſt inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ſuch terrible times would permit. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be
more affecting than the picture of Britain at that period; though the Roman
ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery were drawn away, their families and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants were ſtill
ſpread over the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and left without a ſingle perſon, of
conduct or courage, to defend them. The Britons, who were left, began to enter
into freſh diſſentions for ſuperiority: the enemy continued to pour in
greater numbers than ever, from their native foreſts and <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0443100201:32"/>
mountains: famine, with all its horrid attendants, of diſeaſe, robbery, and
ſedition, increaſed the miſery of the times: their vices, as Gildas, a
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary writer, obſerves, kept pace with their calamities, the whole
forming one deteſtable groupe of cowardice, cruelty, and diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>In this terrible ſituation it was, that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored the
aſſiſtance of the Romans for relief; their letter upon this occaſion
ſtill remains upon record: 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>To Aetius, thrice Conſul. The groans of the
Britons. Driven by our barbarous enemy to the ſea, and from thence back upon
the barbarians, we have only left us the choice of a grave: either to be killed
by the one, or to be drowned by the other.</hi>
               </q> The Romans, however, were
unable to help themſelves, much leſs capable of giving ſuccour to ſo
remote, and, at preſent, ſuch unſerviceable allies.</p>
            <p>Yet, amidſt ſuch calamities, this people ſeemed to have
ſtill a peculiar happineſs in ſtore, for they had, in general, embraced
Chriſtianity. At what time the Goſpel was firſt preached in this iſland
is not known, nor is it material to know: it is certain, that England converted
its Pagan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors to the lights of revelation; and, though this people
received laws from others, they adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with the religion of truth.</p>
            <p>Arts, arms, and elegance, muſt take their riſe, by ſlow
degrees, in every country, and can never be, at once, introduced into it with
ſucceſs. All the pains, beſtowed in Britiſh education, only ſerved to
render this people more miſerable; dreſſed them up as victims for every
invader, and plunged them in all the miſery of knowing happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without
being able to enjoy refinement. The people of a country, juſt reclaimed from
barbarity, in ſome meaſure reſemble the ſoil. The cultivation 
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0443100201:33"/> of a few years may be ſufficient to clear away the
obſtacles to agriculture, but it requires ſeveral ages, before the land
acquires a proper degree of fertility. Thus, all the blood and treaſure,
which the Romans loſt in the conqueſt of Britain, in the

            <p>I Remember but few inſtances in hiſtory, where the conquerors
did not excel the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, in every virtue. Savage barbarity, of
ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate luxury, have almoſt ever been imputed to thoſe countries which
were obliged to admit a foreign invader. There is a period, between natural
rudeneſs and exceſſive refinement, which ſeems peculiarly adapted for
conqueſt and war, and fits mankind for every virtuous and great
atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In this ſtate of half-refinement, the Saxons were at the time
in which the Britons were thus diſtreſſed. This virtuous and warlike
people had conquered wherever they came, and to them the wretched remains of
this forlorn people had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe for protection.</p>
            <p>As the conqueſt of this iſland is generally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the
Saxons as a piece of treachery, and an invaſion of thoſe rights they were
only called to protect, I ſhall give the invitation they received 
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0443100201:34"/> from the Britons, as it hath been left us by
Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichindus, a cotemporary hiſtorian of credit; and from hence it may be
judged, what little right the Britons had afterwards to complain: 
<q rend="inline">"The poor and diſtreſſed Britons, almoſt
worn out by hoſtile invaſions, and harraſſed by continual
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, are humble ſuppliants to you, moſt valiant Saxons, for
ſuccour. We are poſſeſſed of a wide, extended, and a fertile country;
this we yield wholly to be at your devotion and command. Beneath the wing of
your valour, we ſeek for ſafety, and ſhall willingly undergo whatever
ſervices you may hereafter be pleaſed to impoſe."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Saxons were one branch of thoſe Gothic nations, which,
ſwarming from the northern hive, came to give laws and liberty to the reſt
of Europe. A branch of theſe, under the name of Suevi, had, ſome time
before Caeſar's invaſion of Gaul, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and poſſeſſed an
extenſive empire in Germany. Theſe, for their ſtrength and valour, were
grown formidable to all the German nations. The Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi were reckoned, by their
neighbours, a people for whom the very immortal Gods were not a match in war.
They were after divided into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral nations, and each became famous for
ſubduing the country which it invaded. France, Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and England, were
among the number of their conqueſts.</p>
            <p>The Saxons were far more poliſhed than the ancient inhabitants of
Britain, tho' their acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were much inferior to the boaſted
refinements of Rome. They dreſſed with ſome degree of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, a luxury
which was unknown to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons: the women uſed linen garments, trimmed and
ſtriped with purple; their hair was bound in <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0443100201:35"/> wreaths, or
fell in curls upon their ſhoulders; their arms were bare, and their boſoms
uncovered. Faſhions which, in ſome meaſure, ſeem peculiar to the ladies
of Britain to this day. Their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were entirely elective, and nearly
republican; their commanders were choſen by merit, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed from
duty when their authority was no longer needful. The cuſtom of trying by
twelve men is of Saxon original; ſlavery, and baſe ſubmiſſioin, was
unknown among them, and they preferred death to a ſhameful exiſtence: We

               </gap>, by Marcellinus, that a body of
them being taken priſoners by Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus, the Roman, he deſigned to exhibit
them, in the amphitheatre, as gladiators, for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the
citizens of Rome. The morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however, on which they were expected to
perform, they were every one found dead in his priſon, each chuſing rather
a voluntary death, than to be the ignominious inſtruments of brutal
ſatisfaction to their conquerors. The chaſtity of this people is equally
remarkable, and to be without children was to be without praiſe: but, in war,
they chiefly excelled; they had, in ſome meaſure, learned diſcipline from
the Romans, whom they had often conquered: it was their maxim to eſteem
fortune as a doubtful advantage, but courage as a certain good. A nation,
how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, entirely addicted to war, muſt, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be addicted to
cruelty; and thoſe terrors, which a man is taught not to fear himſelf, he
is ſeldom afraid of inflicting on ſociety. The Saxons are repreſented as
a cruel nation, but their enemies alone have drawn the picture.</p>
            <p>Vortigern, who had been elected King of the diſtreſſed
Britons, eaſily induced theſe conquerors to lend him aſſiſtance. They
came over into Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0443100201:36"/> in great numbers, commanded by
Hengiſt and Horſa, of the race of Odin. They marched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Picts,
and, in conjunction with the Britiſh arms, defeated them in ſeveral
encounters, obliging them to retreat into the moſt northern parts of the
province. The Saxons, thus finding themſelves evidently the moſt powerful
people up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the iſland, ſeemed reſolved to reward them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with
thoſe parts of it which were moſt to their liking. They firſt obtained
conſent from the Britons to ſend over for more forces, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of
guarding their frontier. Theſe ſeated themſelves in the northern
provinces, and repreſſed the incurſions of the Picts and Scots with great
bravery and ſucceſs. Thoſe nations were, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, obliged to bound
their territories with the rough and mountainous countries that lie between the
two ſeas, and ſuch have, ever ſince, continued the boundaries of England
and Scotland.</p>
            <p>The province thus ſecured from the common enemy, diſſenſions
began to ariſe between the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons and their new allies. The Saxons valued
too highly the aſſiſtance they had given, and the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, perhaps,
under-rated what they had received. In a conteſt of this nature, it is
natural to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the ſtronger nation alwas impoſes laws on the
weaker. The Saxons, allured by the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſoil and the ſoft climate,
continued to invite greater numbers from the continent, and now turned their
arms upon the Britons, who vainly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to oppoſe them. This contention
was ſtill more inflamed by the difference of their opinion in matters of
religion, the Saxons being all Pagans, and the Britons profeſſing
Chriſtianity. At ſuch a time as this a Chriſtian hero was wanted to
vindicate the rights of Chriſtianity, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0443100201:37"/>
merely for this reaſon, fiction has ſupplied us with a Chriſtian hero
King Arthur, the Britiſh champion, is ſaid to have worſted the Saxons in
twelve different engagements; yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all his victories, and
whatever his proweſs might have performed, it did not ſerve to reſcue his
country from its new poſſeſſors. The Saxons purſued their deſigns
with courage and fierceneſs; new ſwarms of their countrymen came
continually over, till, at length, in about a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury and an half, they had
ſubdued the whole body of the province, and eſtabliſhed in it ſeven
different kingdoms, which were, by the writers of thoſe times, ſtyled the
Saxon Heptarchy.</p>
            <p>The Britons, driven from their ancient poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to
eſcape the fury of the conquerors, retired to the mountainous parts of Wales
and Cornwal, countries barren and deſolate, but, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
ſurrounded by the ſea, and, towards the land, difficult of acceſs. Some
great colonies of them, wholly abandoning their native country, ſailed over
to the neighbouring ſhores of France, where, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing new ſeats,
they gave a new denomination to that peninſula which ſtill preſerves the
name and memory of Britain there, a name no longer continued at home.</p>
            <p>All the poſſeſſions of the Britons now fell into the power
of the conquerors, who began to loſe their natural fierceneſs, and ſoften
into the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of thoſe they had invaded. Though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors ever bring
their own cuſtoms among the people they ſubdue, they, at the ſame time,
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume ſome cuſtoms from thoſe they have conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Saxons now
loſt all that ſpirit of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom their nation had been long famous for,
and, in imitation of the Britons themſelves, among <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0443100201:38"/> whom
ſlavery was permitted ſince the times of the Romans; they ma 'e the people
of Britain ſlaves. Theſe wretches were uſed in tilling the ground,
feeding cattle, and other ſervile works; farming out lands at a certain
yearly ſtipend, but always held at the will and pleaſure of the landlord.
The children of this miſerable people belonged to the ſoil, like the reſt
of the ſtock or cattle upon it; and thus began villenage in England, an
horrid cuſtom, borrowed from the Romans originally, and derived now to the
Saxon, by vicious imitation.</p>
            <p>The Saxons, now no longer fearing domeſtic foes, relaxed into
luxury and vice, and, finding no other enemies to ſubdue, began to fight with
each other. The Princes of the ſeven kingdoms they had erected, began
mutually to emulate each other's power, and, for the ſpace of above two
hundred years, all the miſery that ambition, treachery, or war, could bring
upon a kingdom, was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their animoſity. The
diſſenſions of petty Princes are ever more diſtreſsful to a people,
than the wars of extenſive empires. The hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of this period are as
barbarous as the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions they deſcribe; but it is ſufficient to
know, that, after many various events and revolutions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſeveral
races of the heptarchy, Ecbert, deſcended from the Weſt-Saxon Kings, partly
by conqueſt, and partly by inheritance, became the firſt ſole Monarch of
England. This was the name which the country now aſſumed, to
diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from the principality of Wales, poſſeſſed by the
ancient Britons, and from that part of the iſland north of the Tweed,
poſſeſſed by the Picts and Scots, called Scotland.</p>
            <p>No cuſtoms, truly Britiſh or Roman, were now to be ſeen: the
language of the country, which had been either Latin or Celtic, was
diſcontinued, and <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0443100201:39"/> the Saxon or Engliſh only was
ſpoken. The land, before divided into colonies or governments, was now
cantoned into ſhires, with Saxon appellations to diſtinguiſh them. Their
habits in peace, and arms in war, their titles of honour, laws, and methods of
trial, were all continued as originally practiſed by the Suevi; but their
commonwealths were now no more; theſe were changed for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotic and
hereditary monarchies: and their exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary chaſtity, and their abhorrence of
ſlavery, were quite forgotten. The conquerors were corrupted by proſperity:
they became Chriſtians, indeed, by the preaching of Auſtin the Monk, but
this little improved their manners; twelve hundred Britiſh Monks, who would
not acknowledge Auſtin for a ſaint, are ſaid to have been ſlaughtered
by order of theſe new converted Chriſtians, in a field near Caerleon.</p>
            <p>Chriſtianity, when erroneouſly taught, is even more injurious to
ſociety than Paganiſm. In all the ſacrifices made to the Britiſh idols,
or the Saxon god Woden, I have not read of ſuch a multitude of victims
offered together. The devotion of this people, however, was equal to their
ignorance. Their Kings frequently abdicated the crown for the cowl; their
Queens thought it meritorious, though joined in wedlock, to continue in
virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and ſome, for this erroneous practice, after their death were
canonized as ſaints.</p>
            <p>At this period, namely, the ſeventh century, the arts and
ſciences, which had been before only known in Greece and Rome, were
diſſeminated over Europe, where they ſufficed, indeed, to raiſe the
people above natural and ſavage barbarity, but then they loſt their own
ſplendor by the tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The Engliſh, at the time I am now
ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0443100201:40"/> of, might be conſidered as polite, if
compared to the naked Britons at the invaſion of Caeſar. The houſes,
furniture, cloaths, meetings, and all the luxuries of ſenſe, were almoſt
as great then as they are at preſent; they were only incapable of
ſentimental pleaſure: all the learning of the times was conſigned to the
clergy, and little could be expected from their efforts, ſince their
principal tenet was to diſcard the lights of reaſon. An eclipſe was, even
by their hiſtorians, talked of as a dangerous omen of threatened
diſtreſſes: and magic was not only believed poſſible, but, what is
more ſtrange, there were ſome who even fancied they underſtood magic. In
ſhort, this whole pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod was tiſſued over with ignorance, cruelty, and
ſuperſtition; and the kingdom ſeemed united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Monarch, only the
more readily to admit a new invader.</p>

            <p>IT might have reaſonably been expected, that a fortunate prince as
Ecbert had always been, at the head of ſo large an united kingdom, after the
expulſion of the Picts, Scots, and Britons, ſhould not only have enjoyed
the fruits of peace, but even have left tranquility and happineſs to his
moſt diſtant poſterity. Yet, ſuch is the inſtability of human
affairs, and the weakneſs of man's beſt conjecture, that Ecbert was
ſcarcely ſettled in his throne, when the whole kingdom was alarmed by the
approach of an unexpected enemy, fierce, barbarous, and brave. About this time
a mighty ſwarm of thoſe nations which had poſſeſſed the countries
bordering the Baltic, began, under the <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0443100201:41"/> names of Danes and
Normans, to infeſt the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern coaſts of Europe, filling the coaſts
wherever they came with ſlaughter and devaſtation. It is remarkable enough,
that the people whom they ſpoiled were no other than colonies of their own
countrymen, who had emigrated ſome centuries before, and plundered thoſe
very countries, where they were now themſelves plundered in turn. The Normans
fell upon the northern coaſts of France. The Danes chiefly levelled their
fury at England, and, entering the Thames with an incredible num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of
ſhips, carried away all that could neither be defended nor withdrawn from the
ſuddenneſs of the invaſion.</p>
            <p>The weak oppoſition the Danes met with from the Engliſh, only
ſerved to invite them to renew their depredations, and make freſh attempts
the ſucceeding ſeaſon. The braveſt blood of the Engliſh had been
already exhauſted in civil war, under the diſſenſions of the Saxon
heptarchy; and, when thoſe wars were terminated, pilgrimages, penances,
cloiſters, and ſuperſtitions, ſerved to enfeeble the remainder. Thus
the Saxons were become as unequal to make oppoſition againſt the Danes, as
the Britons were to oppoſe the Saxons heretofore. They therefore bought off
their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders with money, a remarkable inſtance how much they had
degenerated from their warlike an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. The money which was thus extorted,
only increaſed the avarice and the ſtrength of the enemy. It was alſo
raiſed by the Kings, from exactions on the people: this cauſed new
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and ſerved to haſten the fall of their thrones, which
already began to totter.</p>
            <p>This century, however, did not paſs without various ſucceſs,
and doubtful fortune, between the two contending nations. No leſs than twelve
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0443100201:42"/> battles are ſaid to have been fought in one year. The
Danes divided their forces into ſeveral camps, removed them from one part of
the country to another, as they were forced by neceſſity, invited by hopes
of ſpoil, or induced by the weakneſs and diviſions of the enemy. They
fortified poſts and paſſages, built caſtles for the defence of their
borders, and the whole country was, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, covered with their
redoubts, the veſtiges of which remain to this day. This manner of
forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the country, and the difference of religion, ſeem to be the only
cuſtoms in which the Danes differed from the Saxons they had invaded. They
were both originally from the ſame country, and their manners conſequently
the ſame.</p>
            <p>The ſimilitude of language, laws, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſoon produced an
intercourſe between both nations, and, though they ſtill were enemies, the
Danes gradually began to mingle among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of England, and ſubmit to
the laws and kings of the country they had partly ſubdued. But what concord
could be expected between Chriſtians, as the Engliſh then were, and Pagans,
for ſuch the Danes ſtill continued? Wherefore, tho' the Engliſh, in
ſome meaſure, admitted the Danes, yet, ſtill, they hated them: this
produced frequent conteſts, which moſt frequently laid the country in
blood.</p>
            <p>In this period of cruelty, jealouſy, and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, a man
ſeemed raiſed up to his bleeding country, to defend its rights, improve the
age in which he lived, and even to adorn humanity. Alfred the Great was the
fourth ſon of Ethelwolfe, King of England, and had received the earlier part
of his education under the inſpection of Pope Leo, in Rome, which was at that
time the chief ſeat of arts and learning in Europe. Upon the death of his
elder brother, Ethelred, he was called <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0443100201:43"/> to the Engliſh
throne, of which he was only no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally put in poſſeſſion, the country
being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run by the Danes, who governed with cruelty and pride.</p>
            <p>His reign began with wars, and he was forced into the field
immediately upon his coronation. His firſt battles were fought with merited
ſucceſs, but, at length, being overpowered by a Daniſh combination, the
unfortunate Alfred was obliged to ſeek ſafety by flight. In this manner
being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned by the world, without ſuccour, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an enemy in
every face, the royal fugitive was reſolved not to forſake his country, as
was uſual with his predeceſſors. He retired to the cottage of a cowherd,
in a ſolitary part of the county of Somerſet, at the confluence of the
rivers Parret and Thone: here he lived ſix months, as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and, as
we are told, was ſometimes reproved for his indolence, by his miſtreſs,
the cowherd's wife. The Earl of Devonſhire was alone privy to the place of
his retreat; and happening to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw a body of the Danes, acquainted Alfred
with the news of his ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Alfred now, therefore, began to conſider how to turn the preſent
conſternation of the enemy to his own advantage. He apprized his friends with
the place of his retreat, and inſtructed them to be ready, with what troops
they could raiſe, upon a minute's warning. But ſtill, none was found who
would undertake to give intelligence of the forces, or poſture of the enemy.
Not knowing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who to confide in, he undertook this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous taſk
himſelf: in the ſimple dreſs of a ſhepherd, with an harp in his hand,
he entered the Daniſh camp, had admiſſion to the principal generals, and
was allowed to excel upon that inſtrument. He <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0443100201:44"/> ſoon
perceived that they were divided among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; he ſeizes the
favourable moment, flies to the Earl of Devonſhire, heads his troops, forces
their camp, and gains a complete victory.</p>
            <p>Alfred knew the arts of negotiation as well as thoſe of war; he
had ſufficient addreſs to cauſe himſelf to be acknowledged King by the
Danes, as well as his own natural ſubjects. London ſtill remained to be
ſubdued: he beſieged it, took and fortified it in a manner which was then
thought impregnable. He fitted out a fleet, kept the Danes in his dominions
under proper ſubjection, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the invaſions of others from
abroad. His next care was to poliſh that country, by the arts of peace, which
he had ſubdued by the arts of war. He is ſaid to have drawn up a body of
laws, but thoſe which remain to this day, under his name, ſeem to be no
more than laws already practifed in the country by his Saxon anceſtors, and
to which, probably, he gave his ſanction. The trial by juries, mulcts and
fines for offences, by ſome aſcribed to him, are of a much more ancient
date than his reign. It is ſufficient to obſerve, that the penal laws of
our anceſtors were mild and humane. As a nation becomes more polite, the
penal laws become more numerous and ſevere, till, at length, growing
intolerable to the poor, againſt whom they are principally levelled, they
throw off the yoke of legal bondage, either by admitting a deſpotic prince,
or by taking the government into their own hands, by military invaſion. I
remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber few great characters, in hiſtory, that had not a regard for the
ſciences. Alfred is ſaid to have founded the univerſity of Oxford, and
ſupplied it with books from Rome. The ſpirit of ſuperſtition had quite
ſuppreſſed all the efforts of philoſophy <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0443100201:45"/> at that
period: he is ſaid to have lamented, that no prieſt, in all his dominions,
underſtood Latin: as for him, he knew it, and was alſo well verſed in the
geometry of thoſe barbarous ages. He was an excellent hiſtorian, made
ſome tranſlations from the Latin which ſtill ſubſiſt and it is even
ſaid, that he compoſed ſome excellent poems in the Saxon language.
Thoſe hours which he could take from buſineſs he gave to ſtudy. He was
a complete oeconomiſt, and this gave him an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of being liberal:
His care even extended to the manner in which the people built their houſes.
Before his time, the generality of the nation made uſe of timber, moſtly,
in building: Alfred having raiſed his palaces with brick, the nobility, by
degrees, began to imitate his example.</p>
            <p>From his time, though the reigns immediately ſucceeding are marked
with ignorance, ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cruelty, yet, in general, hiſtory puts
on a form leſs ſevere: the whole nation ſeems to emerge into a greater
degree of politeneſs than it had before enjoyed. The coins of this period are
better ſtruck than thoſe of preceding Princes. The marine, in his time,
ſeems firſt to have given riſe to our claims to the ocean. In ſhort,
from this period, Engliſh hiſtory may properly be ſaid to commence, and
our conſtitution to take its riſe. We are connected with the events
previous to Alfred's reign, only by motives of curioſity: but, with thoſe
that follow him, by the more prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inducements of intereſt.</p>
            <p>This great man died in the year 900, in the 52d year of his age,
after a reign of more than twenty-eight years; the firſt part ſpent in war
and diſtreſs, the latter in peace and proſperity.</p>

            <p>HISTORIANS and critics are fond of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the period which
ſucceeded Alfred, as entirely barbarous: yet, there are many traces of both
erudition and politeneſs, in thoſe very ages which have been particularly
called obſcure. In the reign of his ſucceſſor, Edward, we find
gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, which is one of the beſt marks of polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in any country,
not entirely unknown: his amours with Egwina, who, though by birth a
ſhepherd's daughter, received an education becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a princeſs, and, at
length, ſubdued the heart of Edward, is a remarkable inſtance of the power
the fair ſex then enjoyed. In this reign too, the univerſity of Cambridge
was founded. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Scotus flouriſhed at this time, a man whoſe
learning appears amazing, even to an age which prides itſelf upon its
erudition.</p>
            <p>In the reign of Athelſtan, who ſucceeded Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the Bible was
tranſlated into Saxon, a work which at once evinces a juſt opinion, with
regard to religion and the learning of that age. Alliances alſo on the
continent were formed by this Monarch; it is ſaid he was equally feared by
his neighbours, and loved by the greateſt Princes of Europe. We find little
remarkable in the reign of Edmund I, but that the firſt capital puniſhment
was inſtituted by him. He had remarked, that fines and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary
puniſhments were too gentle methods of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe who were convicted
of robberies, who generally were men who had nothing to loſe; he therefore
ordered, that, in gangs of robbers, the oldeſt of them ſhould be condemned
to the gallows. <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0443100201:47"/> This was reckoned a very ſevere law at
the time it was inſtituted: What would our anceſtors ſay, upon ſeeing
the penal laws now uſed by their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity!</p>
            <p>The death of this Monarch is too remarkable to be paſſed without
notice. His virtues, abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, wealth, and temperance, promiſed a long and
happy reign: when, on a certain day, as he was ſolemnizing a feſtival in
Glouceſterſhire, he ſaw a malefactor, whoſe name was Leolf, (who had
been baniſhed the kingdom for his crimes) ſitting at one of the tables in
the hall where the King was at dinner. Enraged at ſuch inſolence, he
commanded him to be apprehended; but, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him drawing his dagger, in
order to defend himſelf, the King ſtarted up in a rage, and, catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him
by the hair, dragged him out of the hall. In the mean time Leolf had now drawn
out the dagger, and, lifting his arm, with a furious blow ſtabbed the Monarch
to the heart, who fell down on the boſom of his murderer.</p>
            <p>The Danes, during theſe three reigns, were kept within proper
bounds; they frequently revolted, were ſubdued, and treated with lenity by
the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors. The Monks now began to have the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of affairs, and,
conſequently, to enfeeble the ſtate.</p>
            <p>Edred ſucceeded Edmund, and began his reign with ſome victories
over the Scotch and Danes, which the Monks were ſkilful enough to attribute
to the miraculous interpoſition of Heaven. Among the number, Dunſtan, Abbot
of Glaſtonbury, had peculiar influence over the mind of the credulous
Monarch, and, at length, became the director of the affairs of the kingdom. By
this means the Monks acquired ſuch power, as ſerved to retard 
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0443100201:48"/> the vigour of every future operation againſt the Danes.
However, what they took from the real ſtrength of their country they returned
in appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of honour and reſpect. Edred was ſtyled, <hi>Monarch of
Albion, and King of Great Britain,</hi> and this at a period when his monarchy
was upon the very verge o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ruin.</p>
            <p>The ſons of Edred were ſet aſide, and Edwy, his elder
brother's ſon, was placed on the throne. At this time the crown appears to
have been elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and thoſe elections entirely influenced by the clergy.
The Secular prieſthood ſeems to have placed the crown upon this Monarch's
head, in oppoſition to the Monks, who were then riſing into eſteem among
the people. Thus were the Engliſh divided by religious diſputes, and
involved in all the fury of civil war, while the Danes were every hour growing
in ſtrength, and ſending over freſh forces. The Seculars were
poſſeſſed of the riches of the country, but the Monks, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
them, were in poſſeſſion of the power of working miracles. Crucifixes,
altars, and even horſes, were heard to harangue in defence of the Monks, and
inveigh againſt the Secular clergy: but particularly Dunſtan the Monk had
no ſmall power over the hoſts of heaven; his illuminations were frequent,
his temptations ſtrong, but he always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with bravery. The Devil,
ſay the Monks, and that ſeriouſly too, once tempted him in the ſhape of
a fine woman; but he ſoon ſent him off, by catching him by the noſe, and
leading him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout for public deriſion. Such ſtories were then propagated,
and, what is ſtill more extraordinary, were believed. I am the more
ſurpriſed at the credulity of the times, as the people certainly were not
deſtitute of claſſical learning, and ſome ſkill <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0443100201:49"/>
in the polite arts. We have a Latin ſpeech or two ſtill preſerved, which
were ſpoken by their Monarchs at that period, replete with elegance,
perſpicuity, and good ſenſe.</p>
            <p>However that may be, the Monks, by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of
miracles, prevailed: Edwy was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned, and his brother Edgar placed in his
room. Hiſtorians repreſent England, under this reign, as completely happy;
and, it is certain, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſtill ſeemed to enjoy the fruits of
Alfred's wiſdom: for, of all the obſcure ages, from the entire decadence of
taſte, till its revival in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century, this might be termed the
Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. The Engliſh fleets are deſcribed as amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to above four
thouſand ſhips; Kings came to Edgar's court, and returned without
moleſtation or fear. Muſic, painting, and poetry, were then held as
neceſſary accompliſhments to a refined edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as they are now. But
his gallantries are peculiarly the ſubject of the hiſtorians of that time,
and are ſtill the theme of romance. He is ſaid, firſt, to have debauched
a nun, then to have attempted the chaſtity of a nobleman's daughter; but the
amour, which is famous to this day, is his adventure with the beautiful
Elfrida.</p>
            <p>Edgar had long heard of the beauty of a young lady, whoſe name was
Elfrida, daughter to the Earl of Devonſhire: however, not willing to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
fame in this particular he ſent Ethelwolfe, his favourite, to ſee if
Elfrida was indeed that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable woman report had ſpoken her.
Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolfe had no ſooner arrived at the Earl of Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire's, and caſt
his eyes upon that nobleman's beautiful daughter, but he became deſperately
enamoured of her himſelf: ſuch was the violence of his paſſion, that,
forgetting his maſter, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0443100201:50"/> the beautiful
Elfrida for his own wife. His requeſt was granted; the favourite of a King
was not likely to find a refuſal, and they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in private.
Returning ſoon after to court, he aſſured the King, that Elfrida was much
inferior to the repreſentations that had been made of her, and he was amazed
how the world could talk ſo much of her charms. The King was ſatisfied, and
no longer felt any curioſity. Ethelwolfe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after ſome time,
perceiving the King perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indifferent with regard to the lady,
repreſented to his Majeſty, one day, that, though the fortune of the Earl
of Devonſhire's daughter would be a trifle to a Monarch, yet it would be an
immenſe ſum to a needy ſubject, and, therefore, he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prayed leave
to pay his addreſſes to her, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt heireſs in the
kingdom. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, ſo ſeemingly reaſonable, was readily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with. Ethelwolfe returned to his wife, and their nuptials were ſolemnized in
public. He had the precaution, however, of not permitting her to appear at
court, before a King ſo ſuſceptible of love, and ſhe ſo capable of
inſpiring paſſion. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe precautions, it was
impoſſible to keep his treachery long concealed. Favourites are never
without private enemies, who deſire an opportunity of riſing upon their
ruin. Edgar was informed of all, but, diſſembling his reſentment, he took
an occaſion to viſit that part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where this miracle of beauty
was detained. Accompanied by his favourite, when he was near the place, he told
him, he had a curioſity to ſee his wife, of whom he had formerly heard ſo
much. Ethelwolfe, thunderſtruck at the propoſal, did all in his power, but
in vain, to diſſuade him; all he could obtain was leave to go before, on
pretence <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0443100201:51"/> of preparing her for the King's reception. On his
arrival, he fell at his wife's fee, confeſſing what he had done to be
poſſeſſed of her charms; conjured her to conceal, as much as
poſſible, her beauty from the King, who was but too ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of
paſſion. Elfrida promiſed compliance, but, prompted either by vanity, or
revenge, ſhe adorned her perſon with the moſt exquiſite art, and called
up all her beauty upon this occaſion. The event anſwered her expectations:
the King no ſooner ſaw, but he loved her, and was inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved
to obtain her. The better to effect his deſign, he concealed his
ſenſations from the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and took his leave with a ſeeming
indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Soon after Ethelwolfe was ſent to Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, upon
pretence of urgent affairs, but he never performed the journey; he was found
murdered in a wood, by the King's command, who took Elfrida to court, where
their nuptials were celebrated with the uſual ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>I have been the more explicit in this ſtory, as, in the firſt
place, it ſerves to ſhew, that ladies were admitted to court in this early
period; it alſo demonſtrates, that men and women were never kept ſeparate
in England, as in Spain and other countries; it ſtill evinces, that, however
polite they might be at the time I am ſpeaking of, there was ſtill a
ſavage air, that mixed in every action, and ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed
thoſe ages of barbariſm from the civilized ages of Greece and Rome. But, to
ſtamp the age with ſtill greater rudeneſs, Edgar, who was thus guilty of
murder, ſacrilege, and adultery, was placed among the number of ſaints, by
the Monks who have written his hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The defects of Edgar's government fell upon his ſucceſſors;
the power of the Monks increaſed, <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0443100201:52"/> and that of the
ſtate was diminiſhed in proportion. Every proviſion for the ſafety of
the kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to decline; and the remiſſneſs of the Engliſh made
way for new incurſions of the Danes, who exacted exorbitant tributes from the
Kings, and plundered the ſubjects at diſcretion. Edward the Martyr, who had
not the leaſt title to ſo glorious an appellation, was crowned King by the
ſingle authority of Dunſtan, and, conſequently, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed Monkiſh
power: he was murdered by order of Elfrida, who ſeems to have the higheſt
contraſt, in her own perſon, of the greateſt exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal charms, and the
moſt odious internal defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>Ethelred II, finding himſelf unable to oppoſe the Danes,
compounded with them for his own ſafety. But, ſoon after, being
ſtrengthened by an alliance with the Duke of Normandy, he laid a deteſtable
ſcheme for maſſacring all the Danes in the kingdom. This plot was carried
on with ſuch ſecrecy, that it was executed in one day, and all the Danes in
England were deſtroyed without mercy. A maſſacre, ſo cruel and
perfidious, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ending the long miſeries of this wretched country,
only made way for new and greater ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities than before.</p>
            <p>Swayne, King of Denmark, exaſperated by the ſlaughter of his
countrymen, and, among the reſt, of his own ſiſter, who was beheaded in
Ethelred's preſence, ſoon after landed in England, and filled the whole
kingdom with the marks of an horrid vengeance, obliging Ethelred to fly to
Normandy for relief. The Engliſh, unable to oppoſe, yet unwilling to
ſubmit, for a ſhort time groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Daniſh yoke, and again, upon
an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity given, called their baniſhed Monarch back <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0443100201:53"/> to his throne. Ethelred returned, but, being a weak, as well as a
cruel Prince, he loſt the hearts of his ſubjects, and, with their love, all
his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. He never, therefore, could recover ſtrength enough to
oppoſe the forces and numbers of the Danes, to whom many of the Engliſh
nobles, as well as commonalty, had, in his abſence, ſubmitted.</p>
            <p>Swayne was the firſt Daniſh Monarch who ſwayed the Engliſh
ſceptre, but he died before he could be ſaid to come to a peaceable
enjoyment of what he had ſo hardly toiled for. His ſon Canute, however,
atchieved what the father had begun: Edmund Ironſide, elected by the
Engliſh, who was his rival in government, and who ſucceeded Ethelred in
this diſputed ſovereignty, continued, for a ſhort time, to oppoſe the
progreſs of the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh conqueſts with ſucceſs; but, Canute gaining a
bloody victory over the forces of this Monarch, he was obliged, firſt, to a
diviſion of the kingdom, and his untimely death, ſoon after, gave Canute
quiet and undiſturbed poſſeſſion of the whole.</p>
            <p>This fierce Monarch cut off ſome of the Royal Saxon line, and
forced others into exile. He was at once King of England, Denmark, and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
and, from the extent of his dominion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, rather than from the
greatneſs of his mind, he received, from hiſtorians, the title of
<hi>Canute the Great.</hi> The end of his life, however, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different
from the beginning: the firſt part of it was marked with invaſion, rapine,
and cruelty; but the latter equally remarkable for juſtice, humanity, and
religion. Upon a certain occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, being deſirous of ſhewing his
flatterers how l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ttle he deſerved
the exaggerated praiſe with which they loaded him, he ordered a chair to be
brought, and, ſeating himſelf on the ſea-ſhore, where the 
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0443100201:54"/> tide was about to flow, he addreſſed the ſea in this
manner: 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>O ſea, thou art under my dominion, and the
land which I ſit upon is mine; I charge thee, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach no further, nor dare
to wet the feet of thy Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign:</hi>
               </q> the tide, however, advancing as
uſual, he turned to his courtiers, and obſerved, that the titles of Lord
and Maſter only belonged to him whom both earth and ſeas were ready to
obey.</p>
            <p>Harold Harefoot and Hardicanute, his Daniſh ſucceſſors, were
unworthy of him; the firſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for no virtue, and the latter is
diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, principally, for his cruelty and avarice. This laſt,
dying ſuddenly, at a feaſt, left the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh race of Kings ſo hated, by
their exactions and impoſitions on the people, that Edward, ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the
Confeſſor, of the Saxon race, found, both from Danes and Saxons, an eaſy
acceſſion to the crown.</p>
            <p>Thus expired, not only the dominion, but all attempts or invaſions
of the Danes for the future. Though their ravages had continued for above two
hundred years, yet they left no change of laws, cuſtoms, language, or
religion. The many caſtles they had built, and the many families they left
behind them, ſerved alone to diſcover the places of their
eſtabliſhment. After the acceſſion of Edward the Confeſſor to the
crown, the Engliſh and Danes, as if wearied with mutual ſlaughter, united
to ſupport his government, and, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably living amongſt each other,
formed ever after but one people.</p>
            <p>The reign of Edward the Confeſſor was long and happy. He had
lived long in Normandy, and, in ſome meaſure, adopted the language and
learning of that country. His wars were ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, both in Scotland and
Wales, though managed <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0443100201:55"/> by his leaders, and without his
perſonal attendance. The eaſineſs of his diſpoſition, however,
together with his credulity and ſuperſtition, paved the way for another
invaſion of his country, as if the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh were deſtined to be governed
only by foreign maſters.</p>
            <p>The Earl Godwin, by whoſe intereſt Edward had come to the crown,
exerted all his influence to eſtabliſh his own ſon, Harold, as his
ſucceſſor. This too powerful ſubject pretended to be much
diſpleaſed at the favour ſhewn, by the King, to the Norman nobility, who
came over, in numbers, to the Engliſh court. Theſe diſcontents at length
produced an inſurrection. Edward, now grown old, and indolent by nature,
undertook to oppoſe thoſe diſorders, rather by negotiations than arms.
Treating with rebels is a certain method of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing their power: by this
means Harold gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by degrees, the authority he contended for, and had power
ſufficient to ſettle the ſucceſſion upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>While Edward was thus leaving his earthly kingdom to contention and
miſery, he was, in the mean time, buſily employed in gaining, as he
imagined, an heavenly one. It was not ſufficient for him to aſpire to all
the virtues neceſſary for carrying him to heaven; he deſired to be
reckoned a ſaint of the firſt order. He pretended to ſeveral revelations,
was poſſeſſed of the gift of prophecy, and was the firſt who touched
for thoſe ſcrophu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous diſorders, which, from hence, have been
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated the King's Evil. But what gained him a diſtinguiſhed place
among the ſaints, was his continence, his refraining from the woman to whom
he was actually married. It is ſaid he eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed the beautiful Editha,
purely to exerciſe his <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0443100201:56"/> virtues, by withſtanding a
continual temptation. This, as we may ſuppoſe, left her to ſterility, and
thus his leaving no iſſue was the cauſe of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs miſeries which
fell upon the kingdom ſoon after.</p>
            <p>Edward, as I obſerved, had no children. He ſeemed, however,
deſirous of leaving the crown to his nephew Edgar Atheling; but,
diſtruſting his weakneſs to defend this title, and knowing the ſtrength
of Harold, his opponent, he left the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion undecided. It is
probable, however, this weak Monarch was no way ſollicitous who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in a government which he ſeemed himſelf to deſpiſe.</p>

            <p>UPON the death of Edward, Harold now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that he was
appointed, by will, his ſucceſſor. This was no more than what the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of England had expected long before; his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions were believed by
ſome, and allowed by all. He had ſome right to a crown, hitherto elective,
from his private virtues; and he confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his rights by the moſt
irreſiſtible argument, his power. Thus this Monarch came to the throne by
the moſt equitable of all titles, I mean, the conſent of the people.</p>
            <p>His exaltation ſeemed only to be the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his
calamities. His firſt trouble was from his own brother, who, being the elder,
obtained aſſiſtance from Norway to ſet up a title to the Engliſh
crown. Harold immediately levied a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous army, and marched to meet the
Norwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0443100201:57" rendition="simple:additions"/> who, with a vaſt force, had overrun
all the northern parts of the kingdom, and had committed incredible
devaſtation. Both armies ſoon joined battle; the Norwegians, for ſome
time, bravely defended a bridge which lay between them, but, at length, the
valour of the Engliſh ſurmounted every obſtacle. Harold paſſed the
bridge, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the aſſault, and, after an obſtinate reſiſtance,
entirely routed the invaders. There had never before been ſeen in England an
engagement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two ſuch numerous armies, each having no leſs than
threeſcore thouſand men. The news of this victory diffuſed the greateſt
joy over the whole kingdom; but their raptures were ſoon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by
an information, that William of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, ſirnamed the Conqueror, had landed
at Haſtings, with a vaſt body of diſciplined veterans, and laid claim to
the Engliſh crown.</p>
            <p>This Prince was the natural ſon of Robert Duke of Normandy: his
mother's name was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette, a beautiful maid of Falaize, with whom Robert fell
in love, as ſhe ſtood gazing at her door whilſt he paſſed through the
town. William, who was the offspring of this amour, owed his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to
his birth, and his fortunes to his perſonal merit. His body was vigorous, his
mind capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and his courage not to be intimidated. His father, Robert,
growing old, and, as was uſual with Princes of that age, ſuperſtitious,
reſolved upon a viſit to the Holy Sepulchre at Jeruſalem. The nobility
uſed every argument to diſſuade him, but the perſiſted in his
deſign. He ſhewed them William, whom, though illegitimate, he tenderly
loved, recommending him to their care and loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He then exacted their
homage and fealty to this Prince, not yet above ten years old; and then 
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0443100201:58"/> put him under the tutelage of the French King, in whom he
placed the higheſt confidence.</p>
            <p>Robert, ſoon after going into Aſia, and dying, left his ſon
rather inheritor of his wiſhes than his crown. Our young ſoldier found
himſelf at once expoſed to many dangers, from his youth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experience,
from the reproach of his birth, a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected guardian, a diſputed title,
and a diſtracted ſtate. However, he ſurmounted all with uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
fortitude and bravery, nor, till he had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed peace, order, and
tranquillity, in his own kingdom, did he turn his ambitious views abroad.</p>
            <p>It has been already ſeen, that Edward the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, in
flying from his enemies, reſided for a long time at the court of Robert, Duke
of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy; and upon this William founded his claim. Whether gratitude might
engage this exiled Prince to make William, his benefactor's ſon, any
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the kingdom of England, after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, is, at this
diſtance of time, uncertain: William, however, upon the death of Edward,
immediately made his pretenſions, and, upon the former promiſe of Edward,
founded all the juſtice of his demaud. To this he added, that Harold had
himſelf aſſured him of his intereſt in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, when
forced upon the Norman coaſt; and he therefore ſent to remind him of
fulfilling his engagements.</p>
            <p>Harold admitted of neither of theſe claims, and reſolved to
defend, by his valour, what he had acquired by his intrigues. He was at the
head of a large army, lately victorious, and now confident. He obſerved, that
he had been elected by thoſe who only had the power of placing Kings on the
throne, namely, by the people; and that he could not reſign his crown without
a breach of <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0443100201:59"/> that truſt repoſed in him by his
conſtituents. He added to theſe reaſons one of ſtill greater weight, he
was poſſeſſed of power, and knew how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his property.</p>
            <p>William, who had landed his army at Haſtings in Suſſex, about
the beginning of October, at firſt made no appearance of invading an
hoſtile country, but rather of incamping in his own. But he was ſoon
rouſed from his inactivity by the approach of Harold, who returned from the
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of the Norwegians, with all the forces he had employed in that
expedition, and all he could invite, or collect, in the country through which
he paſſed. Theſe were, in general, brave, active, and valiant troops, in
high ſpirits, ſtrongly attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their King, and eager to engage. The
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of William, on the other hand, conſiſted of the flower of all the
continent: the troops of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne, Brabant, Bologne, Flanders, Poictou, Maine,
Orleans, France, and his own, were united under his command. He had long been
familiar with conqueſt, and his troops were confident of his military
capacity. England, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before, nor ever ſince, ſaw two ſuch armies
drawn up to diſpute its crown. The day before the battle William ſent an
offer to Harold, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the quarrel between them by ſingle combat, and
thus ſpare the blood of their people; but Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold refuſed, and ſaid he
would leave it to God to determine. Both armies, therefore, that night pitched
in ſight of each other, expecting the next terrible day with ſollicitude:
the Engliſh paſſed the night in ſongs and feaſting, the Normans in
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and prayer.</p>
            <p>The next morning, at ſeven, as ſoon as day appeared, both armies
drew up in array againſt <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0443100201:60"/> each other. Harold appeared,
leading on the centre of the Engliſh army, on foot, that his men might be
more encouraged by ſeeing their King expoſed to equal danger with
themſelves. William fought on horſeback, and commanded the body of
reſerve. The Normans began the fight with their croſs-bows; theſe at
firſt galled and ſurprized the Engliſh, and, as their ranks were cloſe,
the arrows did great execution: but, when they came to cloſe fight, the
Normans were hewn down by the Engliſh bills, which, of all weapons, inflicted
the moſt terrible and ghaſtly wounds. William, endeavouring to pierce their
ranks, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted them ſo often, and with ſuch bravery, that he had
three horſes killed in the attempt. Perceiving that they ſtill continued
impenetrable, he now pretended to fly; this drew the Engliſh from their
ranks, and he was inſtantly ready to take advantage of their diſorder. Upon
a ſignal given, the Normans returned to the charge with greater fury than
before, broke the Engliſh troops, and purſued them to a riſing ground.
Harold now flew from rank to rank, though he had toiled all day, from morning
till now near night-fall, in the front of his Kentiſh men; yet ſtill he
conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, with unabated vigour, to renew the fight, and exhort his men by his
voice and example. The day now again ſeemed to turn againſt the victors,
and the Normans fell in great numbers. The fierceneſs and obſtinacy of this
memorable battle was often renewed by the courage of the leaders, wherever that
of the ſoldiers began to ſlacken. Fortune, at length, determined a
victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that valour was unable to decide: Harold, making a furious onſet at
the head of his troops, was ſhot into the brains by an arrow. All the 
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0443100201:61"/> courage of the Engliſh expired with their brave, but
unfortunate, leader. He fell with his ſword in his hand, fighting for his
country, amidſt the heaps of ſlain, ſo that the royal corpſe could
hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after the battle, be diſtinguiſhed among the dead.</p>
            <p>This was the end of the Saxon monarchy in England, which had
continued for more than ſix hundred years. Before the times of Alfred the
Kings ſeemed totally immerſed in ignorance; and, after him, taken up with
combating ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, or blindly obeying its dictates. As for the crown,
it was rather bequeathed by its poſſeſſor to whom he thought proper,
than tranſmitted by he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary and natural ſucceſſion. As for the laws
and cuſtoms of this race, they brought in many of their own, and adopted
ſeveral of the ancient Btitons and Romans, which they found in the country
upon their invaſion. They aſſumed the name of Kings, nay, ſome took the
Greek appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Baſileus, titles unknown in the country from whence
they came. Their Earls were called Dukes, or Duces, a name borrowed from the
Romans, and ſignifying Captains. The lower claſſes of people were bought
and ſold with the farms they cultivated; a cuſtom firſt introduced by the
conquerors of the world, and which ſubſiſts in ſome countries, where
the Roman laws continue, to this day. Their canon laws alſo at that time were
often mixed with their civil laws, and were equally coercive; but theſe canon
laws had their origin from Rome, and the Prieſts and Monks, who drew them up,
generally had their education there. We muſt not, therefore, aſcribe all
the laws and cuſtoms, which at that time prevailed over England, to a Saxon
original, ſince they were, <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0443100201:62"/> in ſome caſes, derived
from the Britons and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. But now all thoſe cuſtoms and laws, of
whatever original, were caſt down into one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon maſs, and cemented by
thoſe of Norman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. The whole face of obligation was changed, and
new maſters and new forms obſerved. The laws were improved, but the taſte
of the people for polite learning, arts, and philoſophy, for more than four
hundred years to come, were ſtill to continue the ſame. It is, indeed,
ſurprizing, that in ſuch a variety of events, ſuch innovations in
manners, and ſuch changes in government, true politeneſs never came to be
cultivated. Perhaps the reaſon may be, that the people ſuffered
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be inſtructed only by the clergy, and the clergy have a
certain ſtandard of politeneſs which they never go beyond, and at which
they were arrived at the time we are ſpeaking of. A Monk of the tenth
century, and a Monk of the eighteenth century, are equally enlightened with
ſcience, and equally fit to promote the arts of happineſs. I am,</p>

            <p>YOU now enter upon that part of the Engliſh hiſtory, which gives
birth to our preſent hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conſtitution. Thoſe laws, which are ſo much
eſteemed by the reſt of Europe; thoſe liberties, which are ſo dear to
us at home, begin to dawn at this period. The Engliſh, hitherto almoſt
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the reſt of the world, began, after this <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0443100201:63"/>
revolution, to make a conſiderable figure in Europe. The variety of
diſpoſitions of ſeveral foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, being imported here, blended
into one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon national character, and produced ſentiments of courage,
freedom, irreſolution, and pride.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the victory at Haſtings, in which, it is ſaid,
ſixty thouſand Engliſh were ſlain, the Conqueror marched towards
London. He car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before him a ſtandard which had been bleſſed by the
Pope, and to this all the clergy quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted. The Biſhops and
Magiſtrates of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis came out to meet him, and offer him a crown
which they no longer had in their power to refuſe. William was glad of thus
peaceably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put in poſſeſſion of a throne, which ſeveral of his
predeceſſors had not gained but by repeated victories; he complied with the
terms which were offered him, and, among theſe terms, it is to be preſumed,
the Church's intereſts were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. Though William had it in his
power to force the people into a compliance with his views, yet he choſe to
have their election of him conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a voluntary gift of their own. He
knew himſelf to be their conqueror; he deſired to be thought their lawful
King.</p>
            <p>Thus was William poſſeſſed of an idea of his own power to
enforce obedience; and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of their own generoſity, in having
freely preſented him with a crown. Impreſſed with ſuch oppoſite
ſentiments, the one was inclined to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a people, whom he, in fact,
thought inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of reſiſtance; and they, on the other hand, were
inclined to revolt againſt one, whom they fancied to have had received, from
their own hands, all authority. Numberleſs, therefore, were the
inſurrections of the Engliſh againſt their <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0443100201:64"/> new
Monarch; and every ſuppreſſed rebellion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave freſh inſtances of
the Conqueror's mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and humanity. The Engliſh were unwilling to pay
any taxes, towards inriching thoſe they now began to look upon as conquerors;
and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam was under the moſt ſolemn engagements of providing for thoſe
adventurers who had left their native country to place him on the throne.</p>
            <p>Hitherto William had acted like one who was rather the father than
the invader of the country, when news was brought him, that a body of
Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumbrian Engliſh, aſſiſted by the Danes, had ſet upon the Norman
garriſon in York caſtle, and put every man to the ſword. After repeated
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, which he had quelled before, and ſuch frequent pardons, which
were the conſequence, he now found that nothing but rigour would do for the
future. He marched therefore to meet the enemy, bought off the Danes for a
ſum of money, and took a ſignal revenge upon the Northumbrians, unable to
oppoſe him.</p>
            <p>From this time he ſeems to have regarded Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land rather as a
conqueſt than a juſtly acquired dominion. His diffidence of the Engliſh
became more conſpicuous every day, and his partiality to the Normans more
galling. All places of truſt and confidence were taken from the one and given
to the other: from this time he thought only of eſtabliſhing himſelf on
the throne, without nicely examining whether the means were conſonant to
juſtice and humanity.</p>
            <p>If hiſtorians, who ſeem partial in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, are to be
credited, England was then in a moſt deplorable ſituation. The Normans
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted continual inſults on the conquered people, and they ſeldom found
any redreſs from their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors; <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0443100201:65"/> in both caſes,
therefore, they generally revenged themſelves by private murders, and a day
ſeldom paſſed but the bodies of aſſaſſinated Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans were found
in the woods and highways, without any poſſibility of bringing the
perpetrators to juſtice. But what is repreſented as the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar grievance
of the times, was, that the Engliſh were deprived of arms, and were forbid
having any lights in their houſes after eight o'clock in the evening. At this
hour a bell was rung to warn them to put out their fire and candle; and this,
which was called the Curfew, was very grating to the ears of the people.</p>
            <p>Inſurrections are ever the conſequence of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, in a
brave nation; William was ſenſible of this, and generally attempted to
moderate the cruel counſels of his countrymen by a gentle treatment of the
offenders. Edgar Atheling, who had the beſt ſucceſſive right to the
crown, was amongſt the number of thoſe who experienced his lenity and
faith. This Prince had gone over to the Scotch, and had perſuaded their King
to join him, with an army, in aſſerting his right to the Engliſh crown.
William met their forces in the northern parts of England, and, inſtead of a
bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, propoſed a negotiation. Peace was eſtabliſhed between the two
nations, and Edgar was included in the treaty. He continued, from that time, to
live, as a private man, in opulence and ſecurity, and paſſed the reſt
of his life, perhaps, more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily than if he had continued in the career of
his ambition.</p>
            <p>William, having nothing at preſent to fear from war, turned all
his thoughts to the arts of peace. He was not yet ſufficiently arbitrary to
change all the laws, now in being, for thoſe of his own <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0443100201:66"/>
country: he only made ſeveral innovations, and ordered all law pleas, in the
ſeveral courts, to be made in the Norman language. Theſe precautions,
inſtead of making the Norman language the ſtudy of all, confined the law to
the peculiar ſtudy of a few. The Engliſh language ſtill continued to be
ſpoken; and, ſuch was the eſteem it was held in, even ſo early, that it
began to be ſpoken at the court of Scotland, and in ſeveral adjacent
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and never was the French leſs engrafted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our language, than
at this very time when they were our maſters.</p>
            <p>William now thought proper to deprive Biſhops of all judgment in
civil caſes, which they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed during the whole Saxon ſucceſſion,
from their converſion to Chriſtianity. He reſtrained the clergy to the
exerciſe of their eccleſiaſtical power alone. He endeavoured to aboliſh
trials by <hi>Ordeal</hi> and <hi>Camp Fight.</hi> The Ordeal trial, which had
been a remainder of Pagan ſuperſtition, and ſtill was held in veneration
by the Saxons, was either by fire or water. It was uſed in criminal caſes,
where the ſuſpicions were ſtrong, but the proofs not evident. In that of
fire, the perſon accuſed was brought into an open plain, and ſeveral
plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, heated red hot, were placed at equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals before him:
over theſe he was to walk blindfold, and, if he eſcaped unhurt, he was
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted of the charge. In the other trial of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the accuſed was
thrown into the water: if he ſunk, he was declared innocent; but, if he
ſwam, guilty.</p>
            <p>The trial of <hi>Camp Fight</hi> was another inſtance of the
deplorable barbarity of the times. This was performed by ſingle combat, in
liſts, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that purpoſe, between the accuſer and the 
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0443100201:67"/> accuſed: he that, in ſuch a caſe, came off
victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, was deemed innocent; and he who was conquered, if he ſurvived
his antagoniſt's reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the field, was ſure to ſuffer, as a
male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, ſome time after. Both theſe trials this King aboliſhed as
unchriſtian and unjuſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all cauſes to the judgment of twelve
men, of a rank nearly equal to that of the priſoner. This number was called a
Jury, and this was a method of trial common to the Saxons and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans long
before, but confirmed by him with all the ſanction of royalty.</p>
            <p>Having continued thirteen years in England, he now thought of
re-viſiting his native dominions: but, no ſooner was his back turned, when
a new conſpiracy was ſet on foot. This was more terrible, as it was carried
on by the joint counſels of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans as well as Engliſh: ſeveral Lords,
of both nations, already poſſeſſed of opulence, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of
independence alſo; and pretended many grievances, or imagined themſelves
aggrieved. The Earl Walthof, who had been formerly pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a like
offence, entered ſecretly into a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with Swayne, King of
Denmark, and Drone, King of Ireland. Their meaſures were conceived with
caution, and purſued with ſecrecy; but ſome delays, intervening, were
fatal to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels which were entruſted, neceſſarily, to many: the plot
was diſcovered ſome days before the Danes arrived; the heads of the
conſpiracy were taken, and Fitz-Auber, a noble Norman, and Walthof, were
beheaded upon this occaſion. Whether this act of rigour was executed by the
King's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſent over from Normandy, or by Odon, his brother, left
behind, and naturally inclined to ſeverity, is not apparent. However, theſe
two <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0443100201:68"/> were the only noblemen executed in England du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the
reign of William the Conqueror, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſo many revolts on their
ſide, and ſo much power in him to puniſh.</p>
            <p>Though good fortune ſeemed to attend this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch thus far on his
reign, here the curtain may be drawn for the reſt. His decline was marked
with domeſtic quarrels, which could neither end in glory nor in gain; his
endeavours were oppoſed by his own ſubjects, for whom he had laboured with
ſuch perſeverance. He had four ſons, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, Richard, William, and
Henry, beſides ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral daughters. The moſt poignant of his
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes muſt, therefore, come from that quarter, where he leaſt
expected an attack, and was leaſt guarded to oppoſe. His eldeſt ſon,
Robert, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the King of France, pretended a right to poſſeſs
Normandy, even during the life of his father. William could place confidence in
none but the Engliſh, to bring this unnatural ſon to his duty; and, drawing
an army of Engliſhmen together, he paſſed over into Normandy, to put a
ſtop to the progreſs of ſo unexpected an inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is
remarkable enough, that the ſame commander, who formerly led over an army of
Normans to conquer England, now returned with an army of Engliſh to ſubdue
Normandy. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his ſon, however, was found a much more difficult taſk
than William had at firſt expected. Robert ſeemed to inherit, though not
his father's virtues, at leaſt his conduct and intrepidity. He led on his
troops with courage, and laid his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcades with ſecrecy: In one of
theſe, after he had killed part of a troop of Engliſh, and put the reſt
to flight, he boldly advanced againſt the main body, where William commanded
in perſon. By <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0443100201:69"/> a ſtrange fatality of circumſtances,
the father and ſon were oppoſed, without knowing each other. William was
now grown old, and unable to perform thoſe extraordinary feats, for which he
was once ſo famous. The ſon charged with ſuch fury, that his aged father
fell to the ground with the blow: death would inevitably have been the
conſequence, and the ſon's arm was juſt lifted to ſtrike his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
had not William called out, and Robert im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately recollected his father's
voice. At once, ſtung with a conſciouſneſs of his crime, and his duty,
he leaped from his horſe, and raiſed the fallen Monarch from the ground;
then, proſtrating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his preſence, he aſked pardon for his
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and promiſed, for the future, an adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his duty. The King,
moved by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of nature, took once more his long loſt ſon to his
arms, and the armies, ſpectators of this moving ſcene, participated in
their joy and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.</p>
            <p>But this ſubmiſſion of Robert was of no long continuance; he
once had taſted the ſweets of power, and knew not how to ſubmit to
ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: again, therefore, he revolted, and again was pardoned by his
indulgent father. But the French, who inſpired him to theſe acts of
diſobedience, and were at beſt inſidious allies, particularly felt the
vehemence of William's diſpleaſure. After he had adjuſted the government
of England, to which he was returned ſome time before, he again led over a
brave army of Engliſhmen into Normandy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make the ſtorm fall upon
thoſe who were primarily the diſturbers of his tranquillity. The King of
France rightly conſidered, that this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament could only be deſigned
againſt himſelf, and attempted to divert it by a truce, which was 
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0443100201:70"/> agreed on, but a jeſt of the French King's ſerved to
renew hoſtilities. William had been confined to his bed by an
indiſpoſition, which, added to his natural corpulency, threatened the
moſt dangerous conſequences. This was a ſituation which it was cruelty to
ridicule; however, the Frenchman, with a levity natural to his nation,
obſerved, that the King of England was lying-in of a big belly. This raiſed
William's indignation to ſuch a pitch, that he immediately took the field,
where, leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ditch, the pomel of the ſaddle bruiſed his belly, and
gave him a rupture. This, added to his former bad habit of body, brought on a
morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, of which he died.</p>
            <p>The characters of Princes are beſt ſeen in their actions, nor is
it neceſſary to give an outline at the end of what the hiſtorian has
painted more ſtrongly in his narration. There is ſcarce a great quality
which this Monarch does not ſeem emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to have poſſeſſed; and,
conſidering the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the times, ſcarce a good one in which he was
entirely deficient. The only objections of any weight, are his avarice and his
depopulating a part of this country, in order to make a foreſt to hunt in for
his amuſement. The avarice of Kings, at that time, was different from what it
is now. Kings acquired money then for the uſes of the public; Kings acquire
fortunes now only for themſelves: the wars of the ſtate were then
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by treaſures of the crown; the wars of the ſtate at preſent
are ſupplied by finances appropriated to that purpoſe by the people. His
making ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive a foreſt can be vindicated only from the barbarity
of the times; a method rather of making his guilt general, than of wiping it
away. Upon the whole, however, England ſeemed to improve <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0443100201:71"/>
by the conqueſt, and loſt neither its name nor its language. It increaſed
in ſtrength and naval power; its laws became more numerous and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional; the
manner of living, among the natives, more elegant and expenſive, and the
ſuperſtition of the clergy leſs groſs and abſurd.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>FEW nations have gone through more revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; few governments
have appeared more unſteady, or fluctuated more, between prerogative and
privilege, than this of Great Britain. The Engliſh have been ſurprized,
betrayed, forced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſituations little preferable to downright ſlavery;
but thoſe convulſions, though they have diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the frame, yet could
not deſtroy the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of a free conſtitution.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen the Norman alter the whole model of government, but
he was unable to extinguiſh the Saxon ſpirit of freedom, which formed its
ground-work: on the contrary, the Normans, and other ſtrangers who ſettled
here, were ſoon ſeized with a ſpirit of liberty themſelves, inſtead
of being able to communicate their native principles of ſlavery.</p>
            <p>William left three ſons: Robert, to whom he bequeathed his Dukedom
of Normandy; William Rufus, who had the newly acquired kingdom of England; and
Henry, who was put in poſſeſſion of the greateſt part of his
perſonal treaſures.</p>
            <p>William Rufus, upon coming to the crown, had two very powerful
parties to oppoſe and to humble. <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0443100201:72"/> The nobility, who
ſtill aſpired to the ſame degree of freedom which they poſſeſſed
under the Saxon Kings; and the clergy, who deſired to erect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into a diſtinct government, independent of Secular power. One or the other of
theſe claims, gave riſe to the inſurrections and diſcontents of this
reign. Nothing can be more eaſy than to imagine, how ill a people, who
thought themſelves free, muſt brook a Monarch who looked upon them as his
property, by a ſucceſſion originally founded in conqueſt.</p>
            <p>Odo, his own uncle, was the firſt to diſpute his title; but he
was ſoon taken priſoner, and, ſome time after, contrived means of flying
into Normandy, where he found protection and honour from Duke Robert. This was
a ſufficient pretext for William to make war upon his brother: it was carried
on with vigour and ſucceſs. Henry, the third brother, was alſo involved
in this war, ſeparately, and upon his own account, having taken up arms for
not being paid thoſe treaſures bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him by his father. Thus were
there three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent armies, each exaſperated againſt the other, and each
led on by one of thoſe diſunited brothers. Such an unnatural conteſt, as
my eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſerved only to weaken themſelves, and
ſtrengthen their enemies. The Scotch and Welch, therefore, took this
opportunity to make ſeveral incurſions upon the Engliſh, while William
was thus purſuing conqueſts that could end neither in advantage nor fame.
To increaſe the confuſion, the clergy loudly complained of incroachments
upon their privileges: the people murmured at every increaſe of their taxes;
Robert de Mowbray was actually taken priſoner, while he commanded a
fortreſs that had ſhaken off the royal authority. <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0443100201:73"/> What
effects theſe diſcontents, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed alſo by the King's
avarice, intemperance, and prodigality, might have produced, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the
moſt melancholy were expected; but now the attention of all Europe was called
off to one of the moſt remarkable events that hiſtory can produce, I mean
the arming for the firſt Cruſade.</p>
            <p>Peter, ſirnamed the Hermit, who had beheld, with indignation, the
cruel manner in which the Infidels, who were in poſſeſſion of the Holy
Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, treated the Chriſtians who went on pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages thither, returned
to Europe, reſolved to inſpire the Princes of Chriſtendom with a zeal for
its recovery. Bareheaded and barefoot, he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled from court to court,
preaching, as he went, and inflaming the zeal of every rank of people. Pope
Urban II. preached the Cruſade himſelf at the council of Clermont, and
numberleſs perſons, of all degrees and nations, ardently embraced the
cauſe, and put on the red croſs, the badge of their profeſſion. Among
this number was Robert, Duke of Normandy: he was brave, zealous, fond of glory,
and ſtill more fond of change. In order to ſupply money to defray the
neceſſary charges of ſo expenſive an undertaking, he offered to
mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his dukedom with his brother, for a ſtipulated ſum. William
eagerly embraced the propoſal: he was no way ſollicitous about raiſing
the money agreed on, for he knew the riches of his clergy: heedleſs,
therefore, of their murmurs, he rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly levied the whole, making uſe of
the moſt pious pretences to cover his extortion. Thus, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his brother
to the Holy Land, he took peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able poſſeſſion of his dukedom.</p>
            <p>In this manner was Normandy again united to the Engliſh crown, and
from this union afterwards <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0443100201:74"/> aroſe thoſe wars with
France, which for whole cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies continued to depopulate both nations,
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conducing in the end to the inriching of either.</p>
            <p>William was not a little pleaſed with this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
acquiſition; and, as one ſucceſs only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a deſire of more, he
began to conceive more extenſive ſchemes of ambition. Poictou and Guienne
were offered to be mortgaged for the ſame reaſons as Normandy. William
immediately raiſed the neceſſary ſum, but death interrupted the
payment. Happening to hunt in that foreſt, from whence his father had
baniſhed the huſbandman and legal poſſeſſor, he was accidentally
ſhot thro' the heart, with an arrow, by one Tyrrel: he died in the
forty-fourth year of his age, reigned twelve, and left a dominion which he had
contributed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, to impoveriſh, and inſlave.</p>
            <p>There were now two competitors for the crown: Robert, who was
engaged in the Holy war; and Henry, the youngeſt brother, who remained at
home. The right of ſucceſſion was evidently in favour of the firſt, but
the latter was upon the ſpot: nothing can be a more evident inſtance how
little hereditary ſucceſſion was minded at that time, than that Henry's
title prevailed, and that he was elected by the joint acclamations of the
people. Whenever there is a diſputed throne, the people generally regain
their liberty: Henry, knowing the weakneſs of his pretenſions to the crown,
was reſolved to ſtrengthen his power, by gaining the affections of his
people. He, therefore, once more confirmed the ancient Saxon laws, and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged the clergy in all their former privileges.</p>
            <p>Upon Robert's return from the Holy Land. where he refuſed to be
crowned King of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, he found himſelf deprived, in his abſence, 
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0443100201:75"/> a kingdom which he conſidered as his birth-right. His
attempts, however, to recover it were without ſucceſs. This Prince ſeemed
only born to be the ſport of fortune: his bravery, his generoſity, and a
thouſand other good qualities, of which he was poſſeſſed, ſerved to
render him the dupe of every deceiver, and the inſtrument of impoſing
villainy. At one time, we behold him proſecuting his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions with
ſpirit; at another, giving up his juſt claims with vicious generoſity.
Thus, after a life ſpent in toil, fatigue, and ambition, he found himſelf,
at laſt, utterly deprived, not only of his patrimonial dukedom, but of his
fortune, his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and friends. Normandy he ſaw fall to the conqueror: to
add to his misfortunes, he at laſt languiſhed, for twenty-ſix years of
his life, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in Cardiff caſtle in Wales, where he died in
captivity. To want prudence is, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to want virtue.</p>
            <p>Henry, having acquired poſſeſſion of Normandy, might now be
ſaid to be maſter of a theatre where many a ſucceeding tragedy was to be
performed; and ſoon his neighbour of France began to ſhew his jealouſy of
ſo powerful a rival. Theſe wars now began which were to be ſo fatal to
diſtant poſterity. The ravages of the French were at firſt neglected, and
Henry remained a quiet ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator in England, as if unprovoked at their
inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: but foon he ſhewed, that his unwillingneſs to engage was by
no means the effect of fear. He paſſed into Normandy with a powerful army,
and offered the enemy battle: the challenge was ſoon accepted, and a furious
combat enſued. During the fight, a French cavalier, named Criſpin,
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally attacked the King of England, and ſtruck him twice on the head,
with ſuch force, that all <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0443100201:76"/> his armour ſtreamed with an
effuſion from the wound. The King, however, no way intimidated, continued the
ſingle combat with reſolution, and, ſummoning all his ſtrength,
diſcharged ſuch a blow at his adverſary, as threw him from his horſe,
and he became the priſoner of his Majeſty's own hand. This decided the
victory in favour of the Engliſh, who purſued the French with great
ſlaughter, which haſtened the peace, that was concluded ſoon after.</p>
            <p>Fortune now ſeemed to ſmile upon Henry, and promiſe a long
ſucceſſion of felicity: he was in peaceable poſſeſſion of two
powerful ſtates, and had a Prince for undiſputed heir, now arrived at his
ſixteenth year of age, a youth of great hopes. All his enemies were humbled,
and many actually in his own power. Matilda, his daughter, was married to the
Emperor Henry IV, and he had the hearts of the greateſt number of his
ſubjects, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Engliſh. All his proſpects, however, were at
once clouded by an unforeſeen misfortune, an accident which tinctured his
remaining life with miſery. Henry, returning victorious from abroad, brought
with him a numerous retinue of the chief nobility. In one of the veſſels of
the fleet, his ſon, and ſeveral young noblemen, his companions, went
together to render the paſſage more agreeable. The young Prince, deſirous
to be firſt aſhore, promiſed the ſeamen a reward, if they came in
foremoſt. This emulation was fatal to them all; the pilot ran the ſhip upon
a rock, and immediately ſhe was daſhed to pieces. The Prince, however, was
put into the boat and would have eſcaped, were he not called back by the
cries of Matilda, his ſiſter. He was now out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger himſelf, but
could not leave her to periſh: he <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0443100201:77"/> prevailed upon the
ſailors to row back to take her in: the approach of the boat giving others an
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to attempt ſaving their lives, ſeveral leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in alſo, ſo
that the boat was overloaded, and all, except one, went to the bottom. When
Henry was informed of the cataſtrophe of his only ſon, he covered his face,
and never laughed after.</p>
            <p>The reſt of his life ſeems a mere blank, his reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſpirit of ambition had nothing now to toil for. His daughter, Matilda,
however, becoming a widow, he married her a ſecond time to Geoffry of
Plantagenet, and, when brought to-bed of a ſon, named Henry, he cauſed the
nobility to give an oath of ſucceſſion, in her favour. The great men of
thoſe times were ready to ſwear whatever the Monarch commanded, but
obſerved it no longer than while they were obliged to obey. He did not long
ſurvive this attempt to confirm the ſucceſſion; he died, as it is
ſaid, of a ſurfeit, cauſed by eating lampreys, in the ſixty-eighth year
of his age, having reigned thirty-ſix.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange, that hiſtorians impute it as a fault to ſeveral
Engliſh Monarchs of thoſe times, that they came to the crown without
hereditary claims to ſupport their title: this is one of the faults al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
againſt Henry, but it is none, if we conſider the uſual ſpirit of other
ſucceſſions.</p>
            <p>During the reign of Henry, the barons and the clergy were growing
into power: each was a pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty tyrant over thoſe who held under him. In order,
therefore, to confirm privileges ſo lately acquired, they joined in electing
a King, who might owe to them, and not to any previous claim, his prerogative
and ſceptre. With ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions they pitched upon Stephen, nephew to the
deceaſed King; and, as for their oaths to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda, <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0443100201:78"/> the
Biſhops gave them an abſolution. They could not, indeed, have made a
properer choice than him whom they elected; but their conduct proceeded only
from a concern for themſelves, and not for the people. Stephen was ready
enough to conſent to all their exorbitant demands; he acknowledged the crown
as their gift, not his juſt inheritance; and confirmed all the immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
privileges, and claims of the clergy.</p>
            <p>The kingdom now began to wear the face of an ariſtocracy, in which
the barons and clergy might be ſaid to command. They built caſtles,
fortified and garriſoned them with their own troops, from whence, when
offended, they would bid their Monarch defiance. Of all miſeries that ever
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected kingdoms, an uncontrouled power among the great is certainly the
moſt afflictive. The tyranny of a ſingle Monarch only falls upon the narrow
circle around him; the arbitrary will of a number of delegates falls moſt
heavily upon the lower ranks of people, who have no redreſs. In ſhort, the
barons clamoured for their own privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, the clergy for their own liberty,
but the people were ſlaves.</p>
            <p>Stephen was ſenſible of this, and, in order to diminiſh their
power, poſſeſſed himſelf, by force, of ſome of their caſtles,
which were incompatible with the ſafety of the kingdom.</p>
            <p>Thus we may diſcern three different contending powers at this
time: the King and his followers, the barons and their adherents, and the
clergy, aſſiſted by the generality of the people: to theſe was ſoon
added a fourth, Matilda, who claimed the crown in purſuance of Henry's
command. This haughty woman, who had been wife to an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and ſtill
ſeemed to retain a conſciouſneſs of <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0443100201:79"/> her dignity,
landed from Normandy, accompanied only by a few followers, and openly laid
claim to the crown. Mean time, Stephen, being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her arrival, flew to
beſiege Arundel, a caſtle belonging to the Queen Dowager, where Matilda had
taken up her reſidence. This fortreſs did not ſeem to promiſe a long
defence, and would have been ſoon taken, had it not been repreſented to
him, that, as this was a caſtle belonging to the Queen Dowager, it would be
an infringement of the reſpect due to her to attempt taking it by force.
There was a ſpirit of generoſity prevalent in the times I treat of, which
was unknown to their degenerate poſterity. Stephen permitted Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda to come
out, and conveyed her, in ſafety, to Briſtol, another fortreſs equally
ſtrong with that from whence he permitted her to retire.</p>
            <p>It is a deplorable conſideration, that our virtues, often
inſtead of being attended with happy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences here, are found fatal to
ſuch as adhere to them without deviation. Matilda, owing her free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom merely
to the generoſity of the King, made no other uſe of it but to levy an army
againſt him, and this army, at length, proved victorious. During the
continuance of this civil war, the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was divided; pillage and
deſolation were the conſequence, whoever happened to be conqueror.</p>
            <p>It was at length, however, determined, by a deciſive victory
obtained over the King. The troops he led, were, in general, foreign
merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, and commanded by tumultous barons, more accuſtomed to command
than to conquer. His horſe gave way, and his infantry, being deſtitute of
their aſſiſtance, ſoon followed their example, and deſerted their
King. All the race of the Norman conqueror were brave: Stephen, unknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

midſt of the field of battle, aſſaulted by multitudes, and reſiſting
all their efforts with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing valour. Had his horſe then railied,
he might have come off victorious. He was now hemmed in on every ſide, but,
with his battle-ax, made way for ſome time: that breaking, he then drew out
his ſword, and dealt his blows round the circle in which he was incloſed.
At length, after performing more than could naturally be expected from a
ſingle arm, his ſword flying in pieces, he was obliged to ſurrender
himſelf a priſoner. In this manner he was conducted, by the conqueror, from
the field, and ignominiouſly laid in irons.</p>
            <p>Matilda now was proclaimed Queen, and, for ſome time, her power
was acknowledged by the generality of the nation. But, as ſhe diſdained to
accept the ſhadow of royalty, which was all the barons and clergy intended to
grant, ſhe diſguſted them by her pride, and ſoon made thoſe repent
who had raiſed her from their levity. The Biſhop of Wincheſter ſeems,
at this time, to have been poſſeſſed of unbounded power. He had been
chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtrumental in raiſing her to the throne; he now, therefore,
levied an army, to convince her, that it was no leſs in his power to deprive
her of a kingdom, than to put her in poſſeſſion of it. He was
ſucceſsful in his deſigns: Matilda was obliged to quit England once more,
and Stephen was taken from chains, and once more placed upon the throne.</p>
            <p>Again put in poſſeſſion of this uneaſy ſeat, he ſeemed
only exalted to give new inſtances of his refuſing the exorbitant demands
of the barons and the clergy. He endeavoured to get the crown to devolve upon
his ſon, but this was not complied <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0443100201:81"/> with by the
Biſhops. It is ſaid, though it has ſcarcely the appearance of truth, that
he confined them in one houſe, and there threatened to detain them till they
complied with his will. This was an extraordinary method of obtaining their
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſeems inconſiſtent with his uſual wiſdom: his
precautions, accordingly, proved unſucceſsful, and the Archbiſhop found
means to eſcape his guards, and fly into Normandy, in order to bring over a
new King, and to raiſe a new inſurrection.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of this Biſhops intrigues, Henry, ſon to the
Empreſs Matilda, and who had been long acknowledged for Duke of Normandy,
ſoon landed with a formidable army. The barons, ever reſtleſs and
regardleſs of their obligations, were again divided upon this occaſion, and
a terrible civil war threatened the kingdom afreſh, when, happily for the
people, a truce was propoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the oppoſite powers: this paved the
way to a more laſting peace. It was agreed, that Stephen ſhould enjoy the
crown of England during his life, and that Henry ſhould be acknowledged as
his ſucceſſor. In this manner a civil war was termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, which had, for
ſome years, laid England in blood. The nation once more began to reſpire
from their calamities, and Stephen's death ſoon put his rival in
poſſeſſion of a crown, which, to the former, had afforded only
diſappointment, fatigue, and danger.</p>

               <salute>Dear Charles,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have hitherto ſeen the barons and clergy becoming powerful in
proportion to the weakneſs of the Monarch's title to the crown, and enriching
themſelves with the ſpoils of depreſſed Majeſty. <hi>Henry
Plantagenet</hi> had now every right, both from hereditary ſucceſſion,
and univerſal aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that could fix a Monarch on his throne:
conſcious, therefore, of his ſtrength, he began to reſume thoſe
privileges which had been extorted from his predeceſſor's weakneſs.</p>
            <p>He firſt commenced by demoliſhing thoſe caſtles which the
barons and clergy built, and which only ſerved as ſanctuaries to guilt,
treaſon, and debauchery: he diſmiſſed the foreign troops which had been
mercenaries to his predeceſſor; and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the poverty of the crown,
reſumed all thoſe lands which properly belonged to it; and enacted ſome
laws, by which the people, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, became independent of their
barons, by whom they were claimed as appurtenances to their eſtates and
manors.</p>
            <p>He gave charters to ſeveral towns, by which the citizens claimed
their freedom and privileges, independent of any ſuperior but himſelf.
Theſe charters may properly be called the ground-work of Engliſh liberty:
the ſtruggles heretofore were, whether a monarchy, or an ariſtocracy,
ſhould prevail? whether the King, or the nobility only? But, by this grant,
the loweſt orders of people began to have a juſt value for themſelves,
and to claim the prerogatives of humanity. Thus was the foeudal government,
firſt impaired; liberty began <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0443100201:83"/> to be diffuſed more
equally upon every rank of people, and the Kings became capable of levying
armies independent of their vaſſals.</p>
            <p>But, though he in ſome meaſure diminiſhed the power of the
barons, by enlarging that of the people, yet ſtill there was a third power,
namely, the clergy, which daily grew ſtronger, and united by one bond,
purſuing the ſame deſign, were mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing large ſtrides to independence.
He undertook to humble them alſo; he perceived the clergy were reſolved,
not only to be exempt from the uſual taxes of the ſtate, but even its
puniſhments. They had extorted an immunity from all but eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
cenſures, in the preceding reign, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to maintain that grant in
the preſent. It may eaſily be ſuppoſed, that a law, which thus
ſcreened their guilt, ſerved but to increaſe it: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, more than
an hundred murders, upon proof, were committed by the clergy, of which not one
was puniſhed, even with degradation. What is ſtill more aſtoniſhing,
the Biſhops gloried in their horrid indulgence. Among the number of murderers
who were pardoned, was a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the dioceſe of Sarum: the complaint
was brought before the Archbiſhop's court, and the circumſtances of his
guilt appeared moſt atrocious. However, the only puniſhment decreed was,
that the murderer ſhould be deprived of his benefice, and confined to a
monaſtery. The King, ſtruck with horror at ſuch injuſtice, reproached
the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, who, on the other hand, aſſerted, that an
eccleſiaſtic could not be puniſhed with death, and that the King had no
right to intermeddle in the affairs of the church. This Archbiſhop was the
noted Thomas a Becket, who had been advanced, by the King, to this high
ſtation from the meaneſt <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0443100201:84"/> obſcurity: he was a man of
ſtrong paſſions, great pride, and great zeal, which had been, in the
early part of life, ſmothered in deep diſſimulation and apparent
humility. He was, at this time, poſſeſſed at once of the
chancellorſhip, of the archbiſhopric of Canterbury, and was legate to the
Holy See. Theſe were great truſts; but, what rendered him ſtill more
powerful, he either thought himſelf a ſaint, or affected to be thought
ſo; he wore ſackcloth next his ſkin, and his equipage and diet were mean
and ſimple. So much power, pride, and ſeeming humility, united, were
formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable; and ſuch Henry found them.</p>
            <p>The King propoſed, in a council of the nobles, that the Biſhops
ſhould not be permitted to go to Rome; that no ſubject ſhould appeal to
the Holy See; that no officer of the crown ſhould be ex-communicated, or
ſuſpended, without the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign's permiſſion; and laſtly (which was
the great article he aimed at) that the clergy ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the
temporal judges, as well as the reſt of his ſubjects. Such juſt
propoſitions were agreed upon by all preſent, even Becket heſitated not
to ſign his name: they were referred next to the Pope, for his approbation;
the Pope diſapproved of them all. Upon this, therefore, Becket declared his
repentance, for having complied with the King in ſigning the Conſtitutions
of Clarendon, as they were called; and, in order to carry on the farce,
ſuſpended himſelf, as unworthy to perform his functions till the Pope
ſhould be pleaſed to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve him.</p>
            <p>This pardon he quickly obtained, and now he ſet no bounds to his
obſtinacy and ambition. Some hiſtorians deſcribe Becket as a ſaint, and
ſome as a deſigning hypocrite; neither are, probably, juſt 
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0443100201:85"/> in their opinions. He purſued, with inflexibility, what
was in fact wrong, but what education, and the manners of the times, had taught
him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve was right: his errors were rather of judgment than of will; the
world abounds with men who are erroneous, there are but few villains.</p>
            <p>The King was reſolved to humble a man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who had, by his
own authority, been lifted into power, and accuſed him of embezzling the
public money, while Chancellor. While the judges were conſulting, Becket
inſolently entered the council, with a croſier in his hand, to intimidate
his judges: but, notwithſtanding this boldneſs, he was condemned as a
traitor, although he found means of avoiding puniſhment, by eſcaping into
Flanders.</p>
            <p>The Popes had long been growing formidable to the Kings of England.
Alexander III. imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately eſpouſed Becket's quarrel, and brought the King
to conſent to a conference, which came to nothing; another ſucceeded, but
with as little ſucceſs; a third was propoſed, and accepted. The King,
wearied out with the repeated threats of the Pope, and the excommunications of
his clergy, conſented to almoſt every thing the haughty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late demanded.
But when all the articles were ſettled, and Becket was to give the King the
kiſs of peace, he took it into his head to ſay, that it was for God's
honour: the King inſiſted that this expreſſion ſhould be retracted;
Becket inſiſted upon uſing it: this renewed the debate, and the
conference ended once more without effect.</p>
            <p>At length, however, after an interval of ſome years, they were
reconciled, and the Archbiſhop made his entry into London, amidſt the
acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the populace. His pride was now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed 
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0443100201:86"/> by ſucceſs, and he went from town to town in a ſort
of triumphal cavalcade. But he was ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly re-inſtated in his power, when
he began to exert it to its utmoſt extent: he ſolemnly excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated two
lords who had oppoſed him, and publiſhed the Pope's letters, for the
ſuſpenſion of ſeveral biſhops who had ſhewn themſelves his
ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The King, who was in Normandy, ſoon received information of this
prelate's pride and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, and ſoon after the ſuſpended Biſhops
came over to lay before him their complaints: throwing themſelves at his
feet, they implored his protection, and inveighed againſt their
oppreſſor. Henry was now quite exaſperated by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and
continually uneaſy from the repeated inſtances of Becket's inſolence, was
heard to ſay, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Is there none to revenge their Monarch's cauſe
upon this audacious prieſt?</hi>
               </q> Theſe words ſeemed to arm the moſt
reſolute of his attendants, and four knights, whoſe names were Hugh Norvil,
William Tracy, Hugh Brito, and Richard Fitzurſe, haſtened to Canterbury,
and, entering the cathedral, where Becket was officiating, with a few
attendants, they beat out his brains, with clubs, at the foot of the altar.</p>
            <p>His death confirmed thoſe privileges to the clergy, which his
oppoſition could not do. His reſolution, during life, and his
reſignation, when dying, gained the hearts of the people. He was looked upon
as a martyr, and the clergy took care to confirm his ſanctity by miracles.
When the people are reſolved to ſee miracles, they are ſeldom
diſappointed: it was not ſufficient that his ſhrine had a power of
reſtoring dead men to life, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored alſo cows, dogs, and horſes.
It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and believed, that he roſe from his coffin 
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0443100201:87"/> before he was buried, to light the tapers deſigned for
his funeral; and, when the funeral ceremony was over, that he ſtretched forth
his hand to bleſs the people. Thus Becket became a ſaint, and Henry was
ſuſpected of being the author of his aſſaſſination.</p>
            <p>In order to divert the attention of the public from ſuſpicions
of this nature, Henry undertook the conqueſt of Ireland; a project formed
ſome years before, but deferred on account of his long protracted quarrel.
The more readily to gain the Pope's approbation of his undertaking, (for
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could then be atchieved without the ſanction of Rome) he cleared
himſelf, by oath, of being any way privy to the aſſaſſination, and
made a ſolemn vow to go barefoot to Becket's tomb, there to receive the
diſcipline of the church.</p>
            <p>Thus furniſhed with Pope Adrian's bull, which granted him a
kingdom that was not his to give, he ſubdued Ireland with a rapidity equal to
his moſt ſanguine hopes: but it was no hard matter to conquer a country
which was at that time barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and divided under different chiefs, and each
purſuing different views and intereſts.</p>
            <p>But the happineſs this Monarch received from this acceſſion of
power, was ſoon allayed by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy in his own family. Among the few
vices of this Monarch, unlimited gallantry was one. His Queen was
diſagreeable, and he was faithleſs: but, though an admirer of all the
ſex, he ſingled out, with particular affection, Roſamond Clifford, a lady
of matchleſs beauty. Hiſtorians and poets talk of the fair Roſamond in
the warmeſt ſtrains of rapture; if what they ſay be true, never did
Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land produce ſo much beauty united with ſo much grace before. He kept
her concealed in a laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0443100201:88"/> at Woodſtock park, and, in
her company, paſſed his hours of vacancy and pleaſure. But the Queen at
length came to a knowledge of this amour, and, purſuing her happy rival to
her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, guided, ſay ſome, by a clew of ſilk, ſhe obliged her to
take poiſon.</p>
            <p>As this was an offence which the Queen could not be forgiven, ſhe
was reſolved not to forgive. Her ſons were ſoon brought to ſhare her
reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and a conſpiracy was formed, abetted by all the malecontents
of the kingdom. To this unnatural combination Henry oppoſed his uſual
prudence and reſolution: he ſeemed on every ſide aſſaulted, but
every-where came off victorious. Aſcribing, however, the oppoſition of his
own children to the indignation of offended Heaven, he was reſolved, by an
exemplary penance, to conciliate its favour.</p>
            <p>Now was the time in which the clergy were to come off victorious;
this was the ſeaſon in which they were to reap the labours of their
martyred defender; and by one weak action the King was now to cancel what a
great part of his life he had been employed in bringing to ripeneſs. Being
come within ſight of Canterbury, he walked barefoot to Becket's tomb, in
extreme pain; there he was ſcourged by the Monks, and ſpent the whole night
upon the pavement. The Monks were thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtated again in all their claims,
and the people involved in greater ſuperſtition than before.</p>
            <p>This penance, however, no way ſerved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile him to his
family; he even curſed their ingratitude, and, wearied with domeſtic
conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reſolved, at laſt, to undertake a cruſade: his ſon
Richard, however, ſtill purſuing the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of ambition rather than of
nature, deprived <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0443100201:89"/> him of all power to put this deſign
into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. Paſſion and diſappointment, therefore, began to make
viſible depredations on his conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and mark him for the grave: he
fell ſick at Chinon in Normandy, and, finding his end approach, he cauſed
himſelf to be carried into the church, before the altar, where he expired,
with ſcarce a ſingle attendant to deplore his fall.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I compare the Engliſh, at this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, with the neighbouring
nations, I can't avoid remarking in them a peculiar degree of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
generoſity, and politeneſs. They had, during the Saxon Kings, ſunk into
bigotry and effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but a mixture of the Norman fierceneſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
their characters, and rendered them at once valiant yet forgiving.</p>
            <p>You have ſeen Henry, as well as all his Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man predeceſſors,
improve thoſe good qualities in his ſubjects, not leſs by influence than
exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. You have ſeen him attempting to increaſe the freedom of the
people by corporation charters, and to diminiſh the power of the barons by
weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the foeudal government, by which the peaſants and huſbandmen were
ſlaves. In theſe deſigns he ſucceeded, but he failed in his endeavours
of leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening the power of the clergy. The kingdom at his deceaſe,
therefore, aſſumed a different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance from what it wore before his
acceſſion. The people now began to have ſome, though but 
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0443100201:90"/> a ſmall ſhare of, power: the barons had ſtill vaſt
authority, though leſs than formerly; while the clergy might be conſidered
as a body entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from the reſt of the community, governed by
their own laws, and profeſſing ſubjection only to the Pope.</p>
            <p>In this fituation were affairs, when Richard, the ſon of Henry,
came, by ſucceſſion, to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which his reign made no
material altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The prieſts being the moſt powerful body of men, it
is not ſurprizing to find the King ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding their ſchemes, which
perhaps he found it impoſſible to oppoſe. Religion was then the pretext
for every ſiniſter action, obedience to the church the only rule of merit,
and, to oppoſe the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſtianity, preached up as an antidote for
every former tranſgreſſion. The kingdom of Paleſtine had been, for
ſome time, the theatre of war, and had drained Europe of its moſt choſen
troops, which fell like leaves in autumn, either by peſtilence, famine, or
the ſword. In this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel the clergy found means to embark the King, by
awakening his ambition, and ſtrengthening his natural ſuperſtitions. A
romantic deſire for ſtrange adventures, and an immoderate zeal for the
exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts of Chriſtianity, were the ruling paſſion of the times,
and they eaſily became the ruling paſſion of Richard.</p>
            <p>Impreſſed with a deſire of reſcuing the Holy Land from the
Infidels, he left England; and with a numerous army paſſed through France,
took Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus from a Chriſtian Prince, landed in Paleſtine, overcame
Saladine, with a ſlaughter of forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Saracens; took ſeveral
cities from the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and gained much reputation for conduct and
perſonal bravery, yet, after all, acquired no real <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0443100201:91"/>
advantages for himſelf, or the cauſe in which he was engaged. Having
concluded a truce for three years with Saladine, he ſet fail for his return;
but, his ſhips being diſperſed by a tempeſt, he was obliged to land
upon the coaſts of Italy, where, purſuing his way homeward by land, he was
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted by the Duke of Auſtria, and put into the power of the Emperor,
who cruelly and ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly detained him a priſoner, upon the
ſlighteſt and moſt trivial pretences.</p>
            <p>In the mean time England had been left under the government of two
prelates, the Biſhop of Durham, and Longchamp, Biſhop of Ely. The clergy,
ſole poſſeſſors and rulers of the kingdom, might have given what laws
they thought proper; but there is a fatality in the affairs of men, that, when
friends are deſtitute of other enemies, they generally make foes of each
other. The governors, now without rivals in the temporal intereſt,
diſagreed among themſelves, and thus weakened the power of the clergy.
John, brother to Richard, who long had aſpired to the crown, fomented this
jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy among the clergy, and, putting himſelf at the head of the
temporal lords, increaſed their authority by the addition of his own. He
heard of the impriſonment of his brother with ſecret ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and
uſed all his intereſt to continue his captivity.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh, notwithſtanding theſe ungenerous efforts,
continued faithful to their King: his bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and generoſity had ſecured
the hearts of the people, and the cauſe he fought for engaged the affections
of the clergy. The monaſteries, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſtrained their finances to
raiſe a ſum to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his releaſe, and the churches gave up their
treaſures upon promiſe of having them reſtored <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0443100201:92"/> upon
his return. By theſe efforts Richard at length procured his liberty: the
Emperor, either aſhamed of his own baſeneſs, or fearing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
of the German Princes, agreed upon his releaſe for a large ranſom, and
England once more ſaw her brave Monarch return crowned with conqueſt, after
numberleſs victories, diſtreſſes, and ſurmounted dangers.</p>
            <p>The generoſity of this Prince was equal to his valour; he knew
that his brother John had, in his abſence, attempted to ſupplant him in the
throne; he had an exact information of all his intrigues with the French, who
had long endeavoured to blaſt his laurels, and interrupt his conqueſts;
yet, upon this Prince's ſubmiſſion, he generouſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave him all: 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>I wiſh,</hi> cried he, taking his brother by
the hand, <hi>I wiſh I could as eaſily forget your offences, as you will my
pardon.</hi>
               </q> This condeſcenſion was not loſt upon a man whoſe
heart, though naturally bad, was not dead to all the ſentiments of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
From this time John ſerved him with fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and did him noble ſervices
in his battles with the French, which followed ſoon after.</p>
            <p>While Richard was engaged upon the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in a French war, an
infurrection was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed at London, which, though but ſlightly
mentioned by hiſtorians, ſhould be particularly marked by ſuch as would
trace the conſtitution. William Fitzoſborn, commonly called Longbeard, is
repreſented at once as a man brave and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing. He had long been an
advocate for the poor and meaneſt of the people, and had gained the hearts of
the populace, who held him in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme veneration. Upon inflicting a new tax,
the hurthen of which was to fall entirely on the poor, he raiſed an
inſurrection of the people, which the <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0443100201:93"/> Archbiſhop was,
at firſt, unable to appeaſe. The principal citizens being called, upon this
occaſion, to arms, Longbeard was at length hard preſſed, and obliged to
take refuge in one of the churches; but no ſanctuary could ſcreen this
ſelf-delegated champion; he was ſeized, convicted, and, with nine of his
accomplices, hanged in chains. This was the firſt inſtance of the people's
ſtruggling for privileges, as a body diſtinct from the barons and clergy.
Longbeard may be conſidered as the firſt victim to that untameable
ſpirit, which ever ſince has actuated this people in ſupport of their
privileges, and prompted them to the rights of humanity.</p>
            <p>Upon a review of the reſt of this reign, we find the Monarch
almoſt always in the field, or intent upon ſchemes to ſupply his warlike
expeditions; diſappointed of the fruits of conqueſt, or groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in
captivity. If, indeed, it were juſt to aſcribe his misfortunes to his
incenſed father's malediction, we might be apt to ſuſpect it, in ſome
meaſure, as the cauſe. However, after a reign of ten years, thus paſſed
in turbulence and fruitleſs victory, he died of a wound received from an
arrow at the ſiege of Chaluz. While he was yet alive, the ſoldier, by
whoſe hand he died, was brought before him: the King ſternly demanded the
reaſon why he ſought his life? 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>My father and my brothers,</hi> replied the
undaunted ſoldier, <hi>died by your hand, and Heaven has given me the

               </q> The dying Monarch, no
way exaſperated by this reply, obſerved, that the centinel had done his
duty, ordered him a preſent, and forgave him. But the Flemiſh General was
unacquainted with ſuch generoſity: inſtead of complying with the King's
command, he ſeized the miſerable wretch, <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0443100201:94"/> and, aſter
Richard's death, commanded him, in his preſence, to be flead alive.</p>
            <p>All the actions of this Prince were generous and brave. I know not
what pleaſure, Rapin, that ſo frequently injudicious hiſtorian, can take
in leſſening the virtues of the race of Norman Monarchs. Among other faults
aſcribed to Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, he accuſes him of pride; yet it appears he bore the
admonitions of his inferiors with gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and good humour. The
eaſineſs of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as well as the delicacy of his wit, are
apparent from the quickneſs of his replies. It is ſaid, that being one day
admoniſhed, by an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Monk, to part with his three daughters, by which
he meant his pride, his luſt, and his avarice: he wittily made anſwer, that
he deſired nothing more, and had already pitched upon proper huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands for
their diſpoſal; hereſolved to give his pride to the Templars, his avarice
to the Monks, and, as for his luſt, the Clergy ſhould ſhare that among
them. Such inſolent advice, from a churchman, at this day, would be attended
with a very different reply. I am,</p>

            <p>THE wars that were now kindled up between England and France,
continued to depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late both countries, without making, in the end, any
material alteration. John, the brother and ſucceſſor of Richard,
purſued them with unabating vigour. We may regard theſe, and ſuch-like
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, among Chriſtian Princes, as peſtilences, which lay whole
provinces waſte, without making <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0443100201:95"/> any change in their
limits, their manners or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>John, who was ſirnamed Lackland, was, in fact, poſſeſſed
of the moſt extenſive dominion of any Prince in Europe. Beſides the lands
left him by ſucceſſion, he had wreſted Bretagne from Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur, his
nephew, whoſe right it was. However, John, by thus pretending to what was not
juſtly his, in the end loſt even what he had.</p>
            <p>Having made himſelf maſter of Bretagne, the unfortunate Arthur
alſo fell into his power. He cauſed him to be confined in a tower, and what
became of him was never after explained to the public ſatisfaction. John was
ſuſpected, and not without reaſon, of the death of his nephew. He made
ſome efforts to wipe off the odious ſtain, yet without effect: happily, for
the inſtruction of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Princes, this crime only opened a way to his
future ruin; and, having begun his reign by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the enemy of mankind in
proſperity, the whole world, in the end, ſeemed to turn their back upon him
in his diſtreſs. The power of the nobility of France was now exerted, with
juſtice, againſt him: thoſe aſſemblies of noblemen, each of which
was, at that time, the petty lawleſs tyrant of his dependants, in this
inſtance, at leaſt, undertook to puniſh the guilty. Conſtance, the
unfortunate mother of the murdered Prince, flew for protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the peers,
and implored redreſs. The King of England was ſummoned to appear; he
refuſed, and the peers of France confiſcated all the lands and
poſſeſſions which were held under that crown. This confiſcation was
ſoon attended with vigorous efforts to put it into execution; John, at once
both weak and cowardly, a tyrant when unoppoſed, but timorous in danger,
ſuffered himſelf tamely to <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0443100201:96"/> be ſtripped of them all.
He ſucceſſively loſt Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, Touraine, and Poictou, and then fled
back to England, to make himſelf hated and deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, however, he was only contemptible to his neighbour
Princes; he ſtill had ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from the eſteem and affection of
his natural ſubjects, but he ſoon ſhewed, that all his ſkill was only
in making enemies, but that he wanted abilities to reconcile them. The clergy
had, for ſome time, acted as a ſeparate body, and had their elections of
each other generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Pope: the election of Archbiſhops had,
for ſome time, been a continual ſubject of diſpute between the
ſuffragan Biſhops and the Auguſtine Monks, and both had precedents to
confirm their pretenſions: things being in this ſituation, the Archbiſhop
of Canterbury happened to die, and the Auguſtine Monks, in a private manner,
made choice of Reginald, their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prior. The Biſhops exclaimed at this as
invading their privileges, and here was likely to begin a theological
conteſt. A politic Prince would have managed the quarrel in ſuch a manner,
as to let the body of the clergy thus grow weaker by diviſion; but John was
not a politic Prince; he immediately ſided with the ſuffragan Biſhops,
and the Biſhop of Norwich was unanimouſly choſen. To decide theſe
differences, an appeal was made to the Pope. Innocent III, who then filled the
chair, poſſeſſed an unbounded ſhare of power, and his talents were
equal to the veneration he was held in: he vacated both claims, and enjoined
the Monks to chuſe Stephen Langton, an Engliſhman then at the court of
Rome. John knew how to oppoſe, though not to negociate; he received the
Pope's decree with a degree of ungoverned fury, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned 
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0443100201:97"/> the Pope a letter filled with abuſe. Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, in
return, put the whole kingdom of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land under an interdict, and forbad the
King's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects longer to obey him. Theſe eccleſiaſtical thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were, at that time, truly formidable, and the more ſo, as the execution of
them was committed to Philip-Auguſtus, King of France, an ambitious and a
politic Prince. To him the Pope gave the kingdom of England, as a perpetual
inheritance, aſſuring him of a remiſſion of all his ſins, if he
happened to ſucceed in conquering it. He grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all who embarked in this
cauſe alſo the ſame indulgences as were uſually given to ſuch as went
upon a cruſade. Philip immediately embraced the offer; not content with
depriving John of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental dominions, he devoured, in imagination, the
kingdom of England alſo. By his preparations it was evident how deſirous he
was to ſucceed in this undertaking; the ſhips, of which his fleet was to
conſiſt, came together to the mouth of the Seine, whilſt the Princes, his
vaſſals, collected their forces to the ſhore from all parts of the
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. His army was numerous, and the diſcontents of the Engliſh were
equivalent to thouſands more. Philip was ready, therefore, to ſet ſail,
and John, on his part, made an expiring effort to receive him. All-hated as he
was, the natural enmity between the French and the Engliſh, the name of a
King, and ſome remaining ſhare of power, put him at the head of an army of
ſixty thouſand men, with which he advanced to Dover.</p>
            <p>Europe regarded ſuch important preparations with impatience, and
the deciſive blow was ſoon expected. The Pope was too refined a politician
for both, and took upon himſelf what he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have deſigned for
Philip. This ſingular ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0443100201:98"/> was executed by
Pandulph, as the Pope's legate to France and England. He paſſed through
France, where he beheld Philip's great armament, and highly commended his zeal
and diligence: from thence he went over to Dover, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of
negotiating with the Barons, in favour of the French King, and had a conference
with John upon his arrival. He there repreſented the number of the enemy, the
hatred of many of his own ſubjects; he intimated, that there was but one way
to ſecure himſelf from impending danger, which was, to put himſelf under
the Pope's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, who, as a kind and merciful father, was ſtill willing
to receive him to his boſom.</p>
            <p>John was too much intimidated by the apparent danger, not to embrace
every means of offered ſafety. He conſented to the legate's
remonſtrances, and took an oath to perform what the Pope ſhould impoſe.
Having thus ſworn to perform he knew not what, the artful Italian ſo well
managed the Barons, and intimidated the King, that he took the following
extraordinary oath, before all the people, kneeling upon his knees, and putting
his hands between thoſe of the Legate:</p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"I John, by the grace of God, King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and
Lord of Ireland, in order to expiate my ſins, from my own free will, and the
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of my Barons, give to the church of Rome, to Pope Innocent, and his
ſucceſſors, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of England, and all other prerogatives of my
crown: I will hereafter hold them as the Pope's vaſſal. I will be faithful
to God, to the church of Rome, and to the Pope my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and his
ſucceſſors legitimately elected. I promiſe to pay him a tribute of a
thouſand marks yearly, to wit, ſeven hundred for the <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0443100201:99"/>
kingdom of England, and three hundred for Ireland."</q>
            </p>
            <p>By this mean conceſſion John ſecured his crown from a foreign
invaſion, but became effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually contemptible in the eyes of his people:
ſtill, however, he was not hated by his ſubjects, their hatred only was
wanting to ſink him into complete wretchedneſs. After being expoſed to
ſo many diſgraceful humiliations, he now thought, at the expence of his
honour, to ſpend the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing years of his life in tranquillity. But, in
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as he loſt the eſteem of the Engliſh, he loſt their
affections alſo. The former Monarchs ſupported their power by a nice
oppoſition of the clergy and the barons; when they intended to humble the
nobility, they granted new privileges to the church; when they deſired to
leſſen the power of the clergy, they gave greater force to the temporal
intereſts. John was ignorant of the manner of conducting this oppoſition:
he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the clergy, and increaſed their power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making them
his friends; he had it only left now to offend his barons, to render himſelf
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to every order of people. His former pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimity ſoon gave
this powerful body hopes of expecting a renewal of thoſe powers, of which
they had been deprived in the preceding reign. They demanded, therefore, the
re-eſtabliſhment of their ancient privileges, and John believed himſelf
authoriſed to refuſe them. This created new diſſenſions: the King,
with a ſtrange per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs, in turn demanded their aſſiſtance for
the recovery of his loſt dominions on the continent, and they refuſed to
follow him. Their refuſal was ſoon followed by more open acts of
hoſtility; they formed a confederacy, and, at an appointed 
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0443100201:100"/> meeting, forced the King to grant all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and
ſign that charter by which the Engliſh are ſaid to hold their liberties
at this day.</p>
            <p>The barons and the clergy by this ſeemed the only governors of the
kingdom: the commonalty had no ſhare in the legiſlature, they were
paſſed away, with the lands on which they were born, by their haughty
poſſeſſors: they were reckoned only as the ſheep, oxen, and other
moveable poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, which were upon the eſtate. The guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of
an heir was to preſerve the lands entire, and, to uſe the words of the
Magna Charta, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>ſine deſtructione et vaſto hominum vel
rerum,</hi>
               </q> without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or waſte of the men or the things upon
it. The King, the Barons, and the clergy, were all, in reality, enemies to
public liberty. Their party were ſo many factions in the nation,
ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the rights of mankind: how they, in turn, helped to
eſtabliſh liberty, you ſhall ſee in my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture correſpondence.</p>
            <p>This charter was, in fact, giving the barons a definitive judgment
upon whatſoever they thought proper to repreſent as a grievance: they were
to prefer their complaints to the King, and he was, in forty days, to give them
ſatisfaction, or they were legally impowered to command it. This was an
infringement of the prerogative, which he complied with through fear, and, as
ſoon as he was at liberty, he retracted all he had agreed to: he loudly
complained of the force with which it had been exacted, and he demanded
juſtice from the Pope, his new maſter.</p>
            <p>The Pope, who had lately excommunicated the King, now excommunicated
the barons: the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, exaſperated, did exactly what the Pope had formerly
done upon a like occaſion; they offered <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0443100201:101"/> the crown of
England to France. Philip, ever ready to profit by theſe commotions, accepted
their offer with joy, but, fearing the Pope's diſpleaſure if he aſſumed
a title to what was now conſidered as a patrimony of the Holy See, prevailed
upon the barons to elect his ſon Lewis. To this league of the barons with
France the city of London lent its aſſiſtance. We ſhould be careful to
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve every beginning of power among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of England, and this
ſeems to be one of the moſt obvious inſtances. This noble city was the
firſt that freed itſelf from foeudal government, and ventured to follow
leaders of its own appointment: in ſhort it may, at this period, be looked
upon as a little republic, fighting between the powers of ariſtocracy,
repreſented in the barons, and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotiſm, aſſumed by the
King.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the army of Lewis, which was called over to the
aſſiſtance of the barons, committed ſtrange diſorders; while, on the
other hand, that of John, which, like the former, was moſtly compoſed of
foreigners, was ſtill more inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and audacious. Never was England in a
more deplorable condition; ſhe had two armies of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry foreigners in her
bowels, ravaging the country in a mercileſs manner, and threatening ruin
which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever proved victorious. John was, at length, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by his
barons, and Lewis ſolemnly crowned at London. The new Monarch then firſt
thought of having the Pope's ſanction to his claim. The Pope debated in
council the juſtice of a cauſe, which ſcarcely deſerved a moment's
heſitation; while John led his harraſſed army from city to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
diſtruſting even his moſt faithful adherents. Pity then procured friends
which proſperity could not procure: and now the barons were ſtruck with 
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0443100201:102"/> ſome remorſe to ſee their native country, by their
procurement, thus laid deſolate, and their King a wanderer; but what added to
their afflictions was, that their ſervices were hitherto ſlightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid
by the new-crowned Monarch, and, from a knowledge of his diſpoſition, they
could hope for no increaſe of future favours. It was even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported among
them, that his intentions were to baniſh them for their diſloyalty to their
former ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, though exerted in his own favour. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their motives
might be, forty barons addreſſed letters of ſubmiſſive ſuit to King
John; the Pope alſo held the juſtice of his claim in ſuſpenſe; a
gleam of diſtant proſperity ſeemed to brighten his affairs: but, while
the conjuncture ſeemed big with new events, the death of both the Pope, and
of John, decided the conteſt. This Monarch died in the fifty-firſt year of
his age, after a reign of more than ſeventeen years, ſpent in wars without
ſucceſs, and exertions of power without increaſe of authority. I am,</p>

            <p>HAD Lewis, who was crowned King, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled till
poſſeſſed of uncontrouled power, he might have retained the crown. But
the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons wanted a Monarch ſubſervient to their power, and Lewis
refuſed a kingdom upon ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. They now, therefore, turned from
the French intruder to the young Monarch, from whom they expected greater
condeſcenſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0443100201:103"/> Henry III, appointed ſucceſſor to the
crown by John his father, was but ten years of age when made King, and the Earl
of Pembroke was, by mutual conſent, conſtituted his guardian. The
inconſtancy of the Engliſh was now more than ever apparent: Lewis was, in
ſome meaſure, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by his new ſubjects, and, after a defeat,
obliged to relinquiſh all pretenſions to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. What the barons,
however, had hoped from the King's tender age, did not anſwer their
expectations. The Earl of Pembroke, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned his nonage, made a powerful
intereſt with the clergy, and, by their means, ſerved to balance the
ſtate.</p>
            <p>While Henry acted under the direction of others, the power of the
barons ſeemed to have been kept under; he had the clergy for him, and
conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the people, and theſe two were equivalent to all the
nobility. But, as ſoon as Henry came to take the reins into his own hands,
numberleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections and calamities were the reſult of his
obſtinacy, folly, and vice. Infinite were the ſtruggles for power between
the barons and the King. Henry's luxury and profuſeneſs continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
rendered him a petitioner to the aſſembly of barons for money (for now the
Kings began to aſk money inſtead of men) and they as conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demanded
a confirmation of thoſe privileges which had been granted them under the
reign of his predeceſſor.</p>
            <p>In order to render himſelf independent of them, he found a
thouſand ridiculous pretences for raiſing money without their
aſſiſtance. He would invite himſelf to the houſes of his ſubjects,
and always expected a preſent at the door: he extorted from the Jews,
wherever he found them, without any <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0443100201:104"/> remorſe. He even
ſcrupled not to defraud minors of their lawful inheritances, to which he had
been left protector; while the people had the mortification to ſee thoſe
ſums laviſhed upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving favourites, foreigners without merit,
ſtrumpets, flatterers, and all the vermin of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious court.</p>
            <p>But all his exactions were not ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his
prodigality; he ſtill wanted money, he ſtill was obliged to have recourſe
to his barons, and yet he ſtill deſired to be abſolute. The barons, on
the contrary, who had long aimed at indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and who deteſted his
cowardice and luxury, refuſed his requeſt. Though no Monarch was more timid
in danger, none was more preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in proſperity: he threatened them,
for refuſing, with his ſevere di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pleaſure, and ſtrengthened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the aſſiſtance of
the Pope, in order to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the kingdom.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Engliſh were complaining of the avarice of their
King, and his profuſion to foreign favourites, the Pope's legate made his
triumphal entry to rob them of what the King had not laid hands on: the
intereſts of the clergy and of the Pope were formerly one, but they now began
to flow in divided channels. The riches, which ſome years before ſettled in
their monaſteries at home, were now drained off to enrich a diſtant
kingdom, already too luxurious. The clergy, therefore, juſtly dreaded the
arrival of an extraordinary le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, whoſe only aims were directed by avarice
and extortion. They expoſtulated, but in vain, to the King, againſt this
unneceſſary ambaſſador from the head of the church: the King hoped to
reap ſome private advantage from his arrival, and he was but little concerned
for public grievances. <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0443100201:105"/> In every demand the King made for
himſelf, the legate would take care to make one for the Pope alſo: he even
propoſed, that the Monks ſhould ſign their names to notes, where a blank
was left for the ſum ſpecified. The exactions, thus daily committed upon
the churches, compelled the Biſhops to carry their complaints to the Pope
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but the King ſtill vindicated the legate's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. At length,
the prelates, quite tired with the repeated demands of the legate, who daily
had ſome new pretext for getting money, reſolved to meet and conſider of
ſome remedy to prevent his rapacity. They accordingly aſſembled, but had
ſcarce begun to complain to each other of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries they ſuffered,
when the legate entered the aſſembly, with a demand for more money: this
they conſidered as an accumulation of impudence and extortion, and they gave
him a blunt denial. The legate, being diſappointed, for this time left the
aſſembly, and went to pillage the Scotch cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy with better proſpects of
ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>An accident happened about this time, which ſerves as a ſtrong
inſtance of the ſubmiſſion the people yielded to the power of Rome.
Some buſineſs induced the legate to take Oxford in his way: he was received
with all that grandeur and magnificence, which, from his character, he had a
right to expect. As the luxury, in which theſe Italian dignitaries lived, was
great, ſeveral ſcholars of the Univerſity, while the legate's dinner was
preparing, entered his kitchen, incited by motives of curioſity or hunger.
While they here and there admired the opulence and luxury of all they ſaw, a
poor Iriſh ſcholar ventured to beg relief from the cook: the cook,
inſtead of giving an alms, threw a ladle full of boiling water in his face; 
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0443100201:106"/> an action which ſo provoked a Welch ſtudent who was
preſent, that, having a bow in his hand, he ſhot the cook dead with an
arrow. The legate, hearing the tumult, retired in a fright to the tower of the
church, where he remained till night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall. As ſoon as he thought he might
retire with ſafety, he haſtened to the King, and complained of this
outrage. The King, with his uſual mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, flew into a violent
paſſion, and offered to give immediate ſatisfaction, by putting the
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders to death. The legate, at firſt, ſeemed to inſiſt upon
vengeance, but, at length, was appeaſed, by proper ſubmiſſion from the
Univerſity: all the ſcholars of that ſchool, which had offended him, were
ordered to be ſtripped of their gowns, and to walk barefoot, with halters
about their necks, to the legate's houſe, and humbly crave pardon and
abſolution. It would be no eaſy matter to bring the ſtudents of Oxford to
ſuch an humiliation at preſent.</p>
            <p>In this manner this brutal and capricious tyrant went on, leagued
with the Pope againſt his own dominions. He had now neither barons nor clergy
in his intereſt, and owed all his ſupport to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the papal
and royal names. The Pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to make reiterated demands upon the
clergy, and the King would beg from his ſubjects at their own houſes, as if
he had been aſking charity. At one time he would get money, by pretending to
take the cruſade; at another he would prevail, by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to re-conquer his
dominions in France; again he would extort aid, under pretext of portioning a
relation: and he would frequently aſſure his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of barons, that,
though he had hitherto behaved unworthily, yet, upon being ſupplied once
more, with proper aſſiſtance, he would reform, <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0443100201:107"/> and
give univerſal ſatisfaction. Thus he drew forth various ſums, which,
without ſhame, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon flatterers, panders to his pleaſures; or
an army of foreigners, which he kept to intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date his native dominions.</p>
            <p>At length, however, the parliament, fatigued with his unperforming
promiſes, reſolved to refuſe his demands for the future: they therefore
entered into an aſſociation, and the city of London was invited to accede.
At the head of this powerful combination was the Earl of Leiceſter, the
King's brother-in-law, who had riſen into power mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his maſter's
profuſeneſs. The King, by a ſtrange abſurdity of thinking, as he became
more feeble and unpopular, increaſed his demands for freſh ſupplies. He
was worſted in France, and obliged to purchaſe a ſhameful truce. He was
conquered by the Welch, and became contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Scotland; yet, ſtill he
continued to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs his own ſubjects with his uſual extortion, as if he
deſigned to create in them that awe with which he failed to impreſs his
enemies. The barons, finding him incorrigible, after an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of near
forty years, at length ſhook off their allegiance, and ſent the King
notice, that they renounced the fealty they owed him, and now conſidered him
only as the common enemy of mankind.</p>
            <p>Both ſides were now up in arms, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try again became the
theatre of civil ſlaughter. The firſt advantages in this conteſt were in
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the King: he was a coward in danger, and ſhewed himſelf a tyrant
in victory. Fluſhed with the ſucceſs with which his arms had been juſt
crowned, he reſolved to march directly to London. He made no doubt but the
city, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0443100201:108"/> by his late advantages, would declare
in his favour; and, had he formerly behaved with paternal indulgence, perhaps
his preſent hopes would not have been groundleſs; but a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his
former ill uſage repreſſed their loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Inſtead of opening their
gates to receive a conqueror, they ſent forth an army to oppoſe his entry.
Henry ſtopped his forces in a panic, and returned to meet the Earl of
Leiceſter, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with his army near Lewes in the county of
Suſſex.</p>
            <p>All hopes of reconciliation being now laid aſide, nothing was
thought of but the deciſion of the ſword. The Earl, advancing with his
army, drew up in order of battle near the King, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, though with
reluctance, to receive him: the fight was begun by Prince Edward, the King's
ſon, who attacked the Londoners with great fury, and drove them off the field
of battle: on the other hand, the King's body of forces were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, after a
ſhort reſiſtance, by the Earl of Leiceſter. His Majeſty, who
commanded them in perſon, gave no inſtances of valour, but tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuffered himſelf to be taken priſoner, which ſoon paved the way for the
defeat of the whole army, and Prince Edward's ſurrendering at
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
            <p>The King and the Prince being thus priſoners, the barons took all
advantages that the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined policy could ſuggeſt. They knew how to
operate upon the King's puſillanimity, and obliged him to ſend letters to
all the governors of the kingdom, to renounce their obedience, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
his caſtles to the conquerors. They who draw their ſword againſt their
King, ſays the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, ſhould fling the ſcabbard away. The barons, 
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0443100201:109"/> with this in view, were reſolved entirely to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>model
the conſtitution, for they now knew, that a compoſition with the royal
captive was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and at this period we muſt fix the date of
Engliſh liberty. The privileges of the King, the barons, and the clergy, were
but different modes of various uſurpations; the commonalty had little or no
ſhare in the legiſlature, and only looked tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on, or were led to
ſlaughter without hopes of ſharing the rewards of victory.</p>
            <p>The barons and clergy, however, now ſaw, that the government could
not readily be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, without ſome greater power than they were at
preſent poſſeſſed of. The dethroning a King, the reſiſting a
Pope, were actions that they could not defend upon the principles of the times:
they called in, therefore, an aid till now entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in the world, they
called in the ſanction of the people. The authority of the barons, clergy,
and the people of England, were ſet to oppoſe the royal and papal
authority. And here, my dear Charles, I cannot but admire the ſtrange
concurrence of circumſtances which brought this firſt dawn of liberty into
being. To effect this, it was firſt neceſſary that England ſhould be
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a conteſted foreign dominion; that the King ſhould
have frequent neceſſities for money to preſerve it; that this
neceſſarily ſhould produce a dependence upon the barons and clergy, and
that this dependence ſhould give them, in turn, a ſhare of power. It was
neceſſary, that the intereſts of the clergy ſhould be ſeparated from
thoſe of the crown, and ſhould concur in the oppoſition: in ſhort, it
was neceſſary that the powers on both ſides ſhould be ſo exactly
balanced, that ſo ſmall <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0443100201:110"/> a weight as that of the
people, as it was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, ſhould be thrown in to turn the
ſcale.</p>
            <p>A parliament was called, in which the King was obliged to give
orders, that four Knights from each county ſhould ſit, in order to
repreſent their reſpective ſhires, and deliberate for the general
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the people. This is the firſt rude outline of an Engliſh
Houſe of Commons; the people had been gaining ſome conſideration ſince
the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the foeudal laws, and the eſtabliſhment of corporation
charters, by which men were, in ſome meaſure, reſcued from the power of
their maſters, and permitted to improve a ſpirit of freedom in towns. As
arts increaſed, the number of theſe little republics (if I may ſo call
them) increaſed; and we find them, at the preſent period, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
enough to be adopted into a partnerſhip of the legiſlation. But theſe
privileges were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the barons, merely to confirm their own; and, could
they have now agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they might have continued in
poſſeſſion of all the authority of the kingdom, and the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
might thus ſettle into a confirmed ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but they grew jealous of
each other's power; they began to fear the Earl of Leiceſter, who had
abrogated kingly authority, and was intent only upon eſtabliſhing
deſpotiſm. This produced new ſtruggles, and theſe ended once more in
the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the King and his family: the Earl of Leiceſter was
defeated and ſlain upon the field of battle. Henry, who had been led about as
a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and always expoſed in the front of that army which had dethroned
him, was once more ſet at liberty by his victorious ſon Edward; and though,
to the end of life, he perſevered in his former fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, yet the people
retained that ſhare of liberty <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0443100201:111"/> which they had acquired
in the turbulent parts of his reign. A ſpirit of liberty had now diffuſed
it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the incorporated towns thro' the whole maſs of people, and
ever after blazed forth at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ſeaſons; afterwards whoever loſt
they were ſure to be gainers; and, if in the conteſt they laid down their
lives, and ſuffered all the hardſhips of war, yet they conſidered thoſe
calamities as trivial, if liberty were left improved and better ſecured to
their poſterity. I am,</p>

            <p>AT the death of Henry III, Edward, his ſon and ſucceſſor,
was employed in the Holy wars, in which, though he gained nothing to the
cauſe for which he fought, he acquired the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an excellent general
and an intrepid ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier. As he came to an undiſputed throne, the
oppoſite intereſts were proportionably feeble. The barons were exhauſted
by mutual diſſenſions, the clergy hated the Pope, and the people, as is
evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from ſome inſurrections at that time, were not much ſatisfied
with the clergy. It was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to ſuppoſe, that a politic and a
conquering Prince would take this opportunity of giving the royal prerogative
its former ſplendor and authority. Wiſe princes, however, are ſatisfied
with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate power, and Edward only laboured to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to his
enemies.</p>
            <p>The Welch had long enjoyed their own laws and cuſtoms; they were
the only remains of the ancient Britons, and had ſtill preſerved their
free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and their country uncontaminated from fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0443100201:112"/>
invaſions: incapable, however, of reſiſting their enemies in the plain,
their chief defence was in their inacceſſible mountains, thoſe natural
bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks of their country. Whenever England was diſturbed by factions at
home, or its troops called off to wars abroad, the Welch would continually pour
in their irregular troops, and lay the open country waſte with ravage and
deſolation. No ſituation can be worſe, than that of ſeveral petty
principalities bordering upon each other, under different commanders, and
purſuing different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. Senſible of this, Edward led a powerful
army againſt Lewellyn, their King: he had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently before been
chaſtiſed, obliged to beg peace, but was ever ready to ſeize an
opportunity of making an advantageous war. Upon the approach of Edward, he took
refuge upon the inacceſſible mountains of Snowden, and there maintained his
poſt without danger. The King of England, not diſcouraged by the difficulty
of the ſituation, was reſolved to inveſt his army, by ſecuring all the
avenues by which it might eſcape. Poſted as Lewellyn was, he might
certainly have harraſſed his enemies without ever himſelf being
deſtroyed, had not a trifling victory over a body of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers induced
him to come down and face the enemy upon more equal terms. A ſmall advantage
gained was interpreted as the beginning of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of Merlyn's
prophecy, in which he was to poſſeſs the whole kingdom without a rival.
Flattered with ſuch expectations, he deſcends into the plain, without
conſidering the inequality of his forces: the Welch and the Engliſh now,
for the laſt time, drew up againſt each other. Lewellyn, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
performed all that courage and deſperation could inſpire, found himſelf,
at laſt, fatally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0443100201:113"/> he was killed upon the
field of battle, and his forces utterly routed. With him expired the
diſtinction of his nation; it was ſoon after united to the kingdom of
England, and made a principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, given to the eldeſt ſon of the crown.
Foreign conqueſts might add to the glory, but the preſent added to the
felicity of the kingdom. The Welch were now blended with their conquerors, and,
in the revolution of a few ages, all national animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity was entirely
forgotten.</p>
            <p>His native dominions being thus freed from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry invader, the King
ſoon had an opportunity to increaſe his power, by the diſſenſion of
his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. The crown of Scotland, after the death of Alexander the Third,
became deſtitute of any apparent heir: John Bruce and Robert Baliol divided
all the ſuffrages of the kingdom. A civil war impended, and nothing but an
umpire, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by mutual conſent, could determine the conteſt without
blood<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> For this purpoſe, by a
fatal miſtake in the politics of the Scotch, Edward was choſen, accepted
the mediation with pleaſure, came to Norham, and, from being choſen
um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, claimed a ſuperiority over the country, whoſe crown had been
ſubmitted to his deciſion, and aſſerted his right to the government. To
wear the appearance of juſtice, however, after long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations, in which
great care was taken to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate his right to the crown of Scotland, he fixed
Baliol on the throne, leſs as King than as a vaſſal of England.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſtep taken by Edward, after placing Baliol on the
throne, was ſufficient to convince the Scots of his intentions to ſtretch
his ſuperior prerogative to the utmoſt. A merchant of Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coigne 
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0443100201:114"/> preſented a petition to him, implying, that Alexander,
late King of Scotland, was indebted to him a certain ſum, ſtill unpaid,
notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his ſollicitations to the new King for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Edward eagerly embraced this opportunity of exerciſing his new right, and
ſummoned the King of Scotland to appear at Weſtminſter, to anſwer, in
perſon, to the complaint which was brought againſt him by the merchant.
Upon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects equally trivial he ſent ſix different ſummons, at
different times, in one year; ſo that the Scotch King ſoon perceived
himſelf only poſſeſſed of the name, without the authority. Willing,
therefore, to ſhake off ſo troubleſome a maſter, Baliol re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted, and
procured the Pope's abſolution for the infraction of his former oaths of
homage. Edward now offered the crown to Bruce, who accepted it with joy; and
thus a ſtrong party of the Scotch was added in ſtrengthening the Engliſh
King to ſubdue their native country. Edward, at the head of a numerous army,
marched into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: numberleſs were the victories gained on one ſide
and the other, in which the conquerors acquired much honour, but either country
loſt the braveſt of its ſubjects. But wars like theſe, though mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely
related by every hiſtorian, are ſcarce worth treaſuring in any memory,
but that of an herald or antiquarian. The whole may be comprized in the
following ſhort deſcription: one barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion meets another in ſome
plain, generally by mutual appointment; little art, evolution, evaſion, or
ſubterfuge, was practiſed or known; they ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon each other, and
numbers and tumult ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally decided the victory: the revolutions of the
government, and not the deſcription of battles fought in theſe reigns,
ſerve to adorn the page of <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0443100201:115"/> hiſtory. At one
ſeaſon Scotland was brought to the loweſt degree of humiliation, and
Edward had laid a plan, which probably he ever had in view, of uniting, it as a
conqueſt, to the crown of England. But his ſcheme proved abortive, the time
of that kingdom's deliverance was at hand; they found ſafety in deſpair,
and, upon the King's return to England, they once more ſallied down from
their mountains upon the Engliſh army which he had left, and gained a
complete victory.</p>
            <p>This was terrible news to Edward, who had already built upon that
kingdom as his own. He was now implacably exaſperated againſt the Scots,
and reſolved to take a ſignal vengeance: to this purpoſe, he ſummoned
all the vaſſals of the crown, without diſtinction, to be ready at a time
and place particularly appointed. His intention was, to march into the heart of
that kingdom, and deſtroy it, to uſe his own expreſſion, from ſea to
ſea. He ſoon ſaw himſelf at the head of the fineſt army England had
ever produced: the Scotch trembled at his approach, but death ſtopped the
courſe of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended devaſtations.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he perceived that his diſorder was to be fatal, he
ſent for the Prince his ſon, whom he had appointed to ſucceed him, and,
taking him by the hand, earneſtly recommended, with his dying breath, three
things: he firſt enjoined him not to recal Gaveſtone, a flatterer, who he
knew would poiſon his principles; he next deſired, that his heart might be
ſent to the holy ſepulchre; and, thirdly, he recommended him to proſecute
the war with the Scotch, till he had entirely ſubdued them; deſiring his
bones might be carried about at the head of the army, the more effectually to
ſtrike terror into an enemy he had ſo often ſubdued.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0443100201:116"/> England began to grow truly formidable under
this reign, the oppoſition of the barons was but feeble and ill ſupported;
the Monarch was, in ſome meaſure, abſolute, though he was prudent enough
never to exert his power: he is accuſed of ſeverity, and it is probable he
might have exerted juſtice with too heavy an hand; yet it ſhould be
particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly remarked, that he was the firſt who began to diſpenſe
indiſcriminate juſtice. Before him, the people who roſe in
inſurrections were puniſhed in the moſt ſevere manner, by the ſword
or the gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet; while the nobility, who were almoſt always refractory, were
treated with a degree of lenity which encouraged future diſobedience; a
ſmall fine, which, in fact, only fell upon their poor dependants, generally
wiped off their offences. He puniſhed both with equal ſeverity.</p>
            <p>However, you ought to remark the alterations in the ſpirit of the
times: the Engliſh, now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated with their fierce Norman conquerors,
were no longer the tame conſenting people they formerly appeared, and always
were prepared to elude that authority which they could not reſiſt. With
this ſpirit of oppoſition a ſpirit of cruelty alſo ſeemed to enter;
regardleſs of their own lives, the people did not ſeem very ſollicitous
about the lives of others. The penal laws now began to aſſume more rigour:
in the times of William the Conqueror, it was a law, that no man ſhould be
puniſhed with death; but that law was at preſent quite laid aſide, and
ſeveral crimes were rendered capital.</p>
            <p>But what gave the reign of Edward a true value with poſterity, was
the degree of power the people began to aſſume during this period. The
clergy and the barons he conſidered, in ſome meaſure, as rivals; and, to
weaken their force, he gave au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0443100201:117"/> to the commons: a
law was enacted, by which no tax could be-levied without their conſent. His
intentions were to render himſelf abſolute by their aſſiſtance; and,
it is but too probable, he might have become ſo, had he lived to put his
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns in execution; but he died at a time he was beginning to throw off
parliamentary reſtrictions, and left the people a ſhare of authority which
had been given them for very different purpoſes than the promotion of
liberty. The moſt healing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are often extracted from poiſons: in
ſhort, whatever Edward's character was, as a man, as a King, he was of
infinite ſervice to his country.</p>

            <p>IT was long an opinion of the Engliſh, and grounded on

able Princes in the nation, there always inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened a King of leſs ſenſe
and courage,

               </q> that there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the remark you have
hitherto ſeen in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſucceſſions.</p>
            <p>No Monarch could come to a crown with more advantageous omens than
Edward II. an army prepared for victory, a people united, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputed
ſucceſſion. But he ſoon gave them reaſons to fear his future conduct,
by the commencement of his reign. Regardleſs of his father's dying
admonitions, he diſcontinued the war with Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0443100201:118"/>
and recalled Gaveſtone, his favourite, from exile.</p>
            <p>Gaveſtone was a foreigner by birth, adorned with every
accompliſhment of perſon and mind that could create affection, but
deſtitute of thoſe qualities of heart and underſtanding that ſerve to
procure eſteem. He was beautiful, witty, brave, but, at the ſame time,
vicious, effeminate, and debauched: he had aſſiſted in all Edward's
youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful extravagancies and pleaſures, had been, to uſe a Latin
expreſſion, his arbiter elegantiarum, and thus had ſecured this young
voluptuous Monarch's affections.</p>
            <p>A prudent King may have private friends, but ſhould never retain a
public favourite: royal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſhould ſhine with indiſcriminate
luſtre, and the Monarch ſhould ever guard againſt raiſing thoſe he
moſt loves to the higheſt preferments. In being thus biaſſed by his
affections, he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be induced to reward talents unequal to the
burthen of affairs, or impatient of the fatigues of application. Such was the
caſe of Edward, with regard to his new favourite; he loaded him with favours,
at a time when he was giving up his title to the ſovereignty of Scotland,
which had been ſo hardly earned by his predeceſſor.</p>
            <p>The barons, at this time, were not ſo entirely humbled, but that
they reſented a conduct ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the intereſts of the kingdom as
well as their own. Gaveſtone's pride, his being a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner, his
inſolence, ſoon raiſed a ſtrong party againſt him: an army was formed
to oppoſe his adminiſtration; Gaveſtone was taken and behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without
even the formality of a trial. Thus you perceive a ſpirit of cruelty
beginning to enter the nation; the death of Gaveſtone was, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, 
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0443100201:119"/> ſupported by the precedents found in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
reign. The ſucceſſors of Edward the Firſt, copied after him in his
faults alone; the vices of conquering Monarchs and great Kings are ever moſt
dangerous, becauſe they moſt generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce imitation.</p>
            <p>From this time the ſcaffolds were drenched with Engliſh blood;
each party, as it happened to prove victorious, brought their priſoners, as
traitors, to the block or the gibbet; never was ſo much blood ſpilt in a
juridical manner in England, as in this hideous reign. The Scotch, during
theſe ſtorms, endeavoured to fortify their government: they conquered the
Engliſh in more than one battle, Robert Bruce, being made King, became
powerful from the diviſions of the Engliſh, who pretended to be his
maſters.</p>
            <p>Edward, in the mean time, ſeemed only intent on proſecuting his
pleaſures, or becoming formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to his own ſubjects. The mutual hatred
between him and the barons ſeemed daily to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, or, in other words,
as he ſtill became more deſpicable in the eyes of the people, the barons,
lately depreſſed, grew into power. His ſupineneſs gave them an
opportunity of executing all their deſigns, ſo that at laſt he ſuffered
himſelf to be taken a priſoner; but he was ſoon after releaſed, upon a
promiſe of future amendment. A certain number of the barons were admitted
into his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and he gave his word to perform nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their
conſent and approbation: but he was only born for misfortunes. This Monarch,
of an eaſy nature, and who, probably, if born in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſtation, would
have been conſidered as a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man, could not live without a favourite.
Into the place which Gaveſtone held in his affections, <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0443100201:120"/>
Hugh Spencer, a youth of great addreſs and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accompliſhments,
ſucceeded. This young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, no way intimidated by the misfortunes of
Gaveſtone, in ſimilar circumſtances, purſued his conduct in every
particular; he even went beyond him in pride, avarice, and prodigality. An
uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal diſcontent ſoon became viſible: all the vices of the King
were imputed to young Spencer alone, and his own were enough to ſink him into
ruin. The barons, therefore, once more combined to deſtroy this favourite,
who was, in reality, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a protector: they therefore baniſhed him and
his father out of the kingdom, with great threats, if ever he attempted to
return. This indignity to the King ſeemed to rouſe him from his former
lethargy; the Queen alſo, a bold haughty woman, endeavoured to ſtimulate
him to revenge: ſhe had received an affront on a pilgrimage to Canterbury, in
being denied admittance, by the governor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the caſtle of Leeds, on the
way. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perſuaded her weak conſort, that the preſent
conjuncture was very favourable for freeing himſelf from the power of the
barons, and, that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the governor of Leeds would intimidate them ſo
far, as to prevent any future oppoſition. Her advice was embraced with
avidity; the King raiſed an army without oppoſition; he beſieged the
caſtle of Leeds, the governor was taken, and the Queen now had an opportunity
of ſatiating her revenge, by beheading him.</p>
            <p>Succeſs only ſeemed to puſh this weak Prince on to new
violences: he beſieged the caſtles of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other barons, and became
maſter of them with equal eaſe. To complete his contempt for all former
compacts, he recalled his young favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, Spencer, once more from
baniſhment. We <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0443100201:121"/> may eaſily, upon this occaſion,
perceive how much the barons were declined from that degree of power they
poſſeſſed two or three reigns before. The Monarch, at preſent, that
oppreſſed them, was voluptuous, ignorant, and a coward, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
opinion of the people; yet, feeble as he was, the barons were ſcarce able to
reſiſt him: the power of the people was now grown truly formidable, and
Edward had addreſs enough to procure a part of them to ſecond his
pretenſions. The King now, therefore, in the meridian of power, proſecuted
the moſt rigorous meaſures: the Queen, cruel by nature, and Spencer, his
favourite, actuated by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, ſtimulated him to numberleſs acts of
cruelty. Among others who periſhed in the oppoſition, was Thomas, Earl of
Lancaſter: this nobleman had always been ſignalized for his valour among
the confederate Lords, and was a peculiar oppoſer of the growing power of the
family of the Spencers: he was taken fighting, at the head of a body of forces
which he had, in vain, endeavoured to rally. He had no great hopes to expect
any favour from judges who were his enemies, from perſonal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: he was
condemned to be quartered, as a traitor; but, from a regard to his ſtation,
the King changed his puniſhment to beheading. In this manner nine other Lords
were executed at York, as a terror to the kingdom; but theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors could
not ſecure a Monarch, who was in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf contemptible. Whatever might have
been the Earl of Lancaſter's real character, his death left it uncertain,
whether he acted with views to get himſelf created King, or was only the
champion of public liberty. However that be, the people in general had his
memory in great veneration, and conſidered him as a martyr. We may by this
ſee <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0443100201:122"/> what ſide in this quarrel was eſpouſed by
the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; immediately after the Earl's death, miracles were ſaid to be
wrought at his tomb, and every pretended miracle of this kind was productive of
a thouſand enemies to the King.</p>
            <p>The favourite Spencer and his father ſtill gave an unbounded
ſcope to their revenge; not content with putting to death the heads of the
oppoſite party, with depriving others of their eſtates, and with condemning
great numbers to perpetual ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, they were reſolved to level their
rage againſt Roger Mortimer, now actually in their cuſtody, and confined
within the Tower. There were few circumſtances that could apparently ſcreen
him from their reſentment; he had been openly in arms, and active in the
oppoſition; he had no character to render his puniſhment unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, and
none that he knew to intercede for him with the King: yet he found his
puniſhment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to his aſtoniſhment, notwithſtanding all the
ſollicitations of his enemies to the contrary. The Queen was fallen in love
with this youth, and uſed all her intereſt to procure his pardon: an
intimacy had actually commenced between them; and this protection, with which
he was publicly honoured by her, drew down the reſentment of the two
favourites. In this oppoſition of intereſts, Edward ſeemed entirely
paſſive; he wiſhed to oblige both parties, and one day gave orders to
ſcreen young Mortimer from purſuit, and the next, to ſecure him wherever
he could be detected: the feeble King knew not how to refuſe any requeſt,
when he loved thoſe who made the demand.</p>
            <p>A diſſenſion thus between two parties, who ſhared the
affections of the King, muſt ſoon ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in the diſmiſſion of
either. To get the <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0443100201:123"/> Queen removed, the Spencers contrived
to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade her to go upon a certain negotiation to the court of her
brother, the King of France. With this propoſal, tho' from her enemies, the
Queen readily complied; ſhe foreſaw it would give her an uncontrouled
liberty of enjoying the company of her gallant, and might give her power of
being revenged upon his oppreſſors. Philip the Fair, who was at that time
upon the throne of France, purſued the politics of every wiſe King; he
encouraged the Queen, his ſiſter, to oppoſe Edward, her huſband, and
thus, by dividing his enemies, he hoped to weaken them. Thus heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, ſhe
loudly inveighed againſt the favourites of the King, levied troops in France
to oppoſe their power, and, with this army, landed in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where her
expectations were anſwered, in being joined by a powerful body of
malecontents. Mortimer, her lover, was with her at the head of theſe troops,
at the ſame time that the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Spencer was the heart of the oppoſite
party.</p>
            <p>Edward was little able to withſtand his enemies: all his
endeavours to raiſe troops proved ineffectual; none would venture to expoſe
themſelves in the King's defence, for they ſaw that an ignominious death
muſt be the conſequence of a defeat, and ingratitude of victory. The Queen
took Spencer, the father, at Briſtol: this gentleman, fourſcore and ten
years old, had paſſed a youth of tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and reputation; he had been
eſteemed and loved by all the kingdom, but his fond compliance with his
ſon's ambition involved his old age in the turbulence of faction: he was
immediately hanged up in his armour, without even the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a trial.
His unhappy ſon did not long ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive him; he was taken, with a few more,
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0443100201:124"/> the King their maſter, in an obſcure
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in Wales. Revenge, and not juſtice, prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the puniſhments
of this reign. The Queen had not patience to ſtay, till the meeting of a
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to deſtory her enemy; ſhe ordered him to be produced before
the inſulting populace, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed herſelf the pleaſure of ſeeing him led
to the place of execution, where he was hanged on a gibbet fifty feet high.
Several other Lords ſhared his fate, all deſerving pity indeed, had they
not formerly juſtified this inhumanity by ſetting a cruel example.</p>
            <p>The unhappy King, now abandoned, ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the power of
his enemies, without a ſingle friend to ſtand between him and univerſal
reproach; he was conducted to the capital, amidſt the inſults and
reproaches of his ſubjects; confined in the Tower, judged by the parliament,
and ſolemnly depoſed. He was aſſigned a penſion for his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;
his ſon, a youth of fourteen, was crowned King, and the Queen appointed
regent during his minority.</p>
            <p>The depoſed Monarch but a ſhort time ſurvived his misfortunes:
he was ſent from priſon to priſon, a wretched outcaſt, and the ſport
of his mercenary keepers: in theſe journies they made him ſuffer all the
indignities, that cruel and ingenious villainy could deviſe. Among others, it
is ſaid, they ſhaved him for ſport, in the open fields, uſing water
from the neighbouring ditch: the genius of the people muſt ſurely have
ſuffered a gradual deterioration, or they would never have permitted the
venerable head of Majeſty, a Monarch, whoſe greateſt fault was the
violence of his friendſhips, to be uſed with ſo much indignity. What
firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſoever the depoſed Prince had hitherto ſhewn 
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0443100201:125"/> in his misfortunes, it left him upon this occaſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>nting to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate a life of
complete miſery. The laſt place of his impriſonment was Berkley caſtle:
here he was kept totally deſtitute of all the comforts, and almoſt all the
neceſſaries of life. But theſe miſeries were not long to continue: the
two keepers, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his apartment one night as he lay in bed, to ſtifle
his cries, covered his face with a pillow, and then, with a cruelty not to be
paralleled, thruſt an horn pipe up his body, through which they ran a red-hot
iron, and burnt his bowels: his horrid ſhrieks, however, were heard at a
diſtance from the caſtle, and, though all poſſible care was taken to
conceal it, his murder ſoon after was diſcovered by one of the accomplices.
Misfortunes, like his, muſt ever create pity, and, a puniſhment, ſo
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate to his guilt, in ſome meaſure ſoften the ſeverity
of reproach.</p>

               <salute>Dear Charles,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I FANCY you now begin to have ſome faint idea of the origin of our
happy conſtitution; and, as I am going to lead you to a reign which gave new
ſtrength to the people, permit me to entertain you a moment with the ſpirit
of thinking in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at that juncture I am ſpeaking of. By the
continual admiſſion of foreigners, in ſeveral of the preceding reigns,
the number of the commons <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0443100201:126"/> was ſurpriſingly
increaſed; and the introduction of ſome new manufactures, of wearing
woollen cloaths, and making glaſs, for inſtance, ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the
retinue of the nobles, and threw great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er numbers of the inhabitants into
chartered towns. The barons, however, ſtill continued to reſide at their
caſtles in the country, gave laws to the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants around them, and
exerciſed a deſpotic autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over all their dependants. The clergy had,
for ſome time, been at variance with the Pope, and this diffenſion
contributed to ſtrip the maſk of ſanctity from both: the diviſion of
the church was a moſt certain means of rendering it contemptible, ſince all
its ſtrength lay only in the influence it had over the minds of its votaries.
But, there was another principle, which had been, for ſome time, operating,
and which, in time, promiſed to be a certain means of diminiſhing the power
of the barons and the clergy; I mean a diminution of <hi>perſonal
ſervice</hi> in war. In former times, every vaſſal was to appear, at the
command of his lord, with horſe attendants, and all the apparatus
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for a campaign. If the nobility, or vaſſals of the crown,
refuſed to march, the King was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to compel them. In this manner a
combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nobility had it ever in their power to give laws to the
crown, becauſe they were not only the deliberating power, but the acting
power alſo: but, from the increaſe of the people, from the more extenſive
uſe of money inſtead of barter, and from the number of independant
foreigners ready to accept pay, from theſe cauſes, I ſay, the Kings began
to levy armies without the aſſiſtance of the nobility. Monarchs now only
wanted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to be at the head of armies as numerous and powerful as they
thought proper; wherever money <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0443100201:127"/> was, there lay power;
and, the people, by traffic and induſtry, beginning to grow rich, they were
neceſſarily admitted into ſome ſhare in the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thus we
ſee the nobility, the clergy, and the people, different from what they were
two or three reigns before this; and the ſtrength of the King did not
ſuffer a leſs mutation. Former Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs might be conſidered only as the
firſt and moſt powerful Baron of the land: a Baron was, in miniature, what
the King was in the great. The Monarch had ſcarce any real power but what he
derived from his own crown-lands and vaſſals: when he was reſolved to
exert his ſtrength, he could only command his own tenants, and thoſe who
held immediately under him; the barons were ſummoned, indeed; but, if they
were diſpleaſed, they might refuſe their aſſiſtance, and all their
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants were obliged to imitate their example; theſe acknowledged
ſubjection, not to the King, but their own maſter; and nothing but a civil
war with the refractory nobleman could bring him to juſtice. But the face of
the old conſtitution was now beginning to be changed; every order in the
ſtate began to have a mutual dependence on each other; the power of the King
to extend to the higheſt and the loweſt of his ſubjects, and oppoſite
intereſts to concur for the benefit of all.</p>
            <p>This change of government ſeemed to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the manners of the
nation; a ſpirit of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry prevailed, which, probably, took its firſt
riſe in thoſe Eaſtern countries, which had long been famous for every
luxurious refinement. Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians repreſent the kingdom as immerſed in
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery and licentiouſneſs: that ladies, laying aſide their
modeſty, ſeemed to glory in the loſs of their virtue. Nothing, ſay
they, was more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0443100201:128"/> than to ſee them riding in
troops to the tournaments, dreſſed like cavaliers, with ſwords by their
ſides, their horſes adorned with rich trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, and behaving with more
than maſculine ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frontery. Whatever Monks may obſerve upon this ſubject,
this aukwardly gallant behaviour, in ſome meaſure, expreſſed a degree
of growing ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance in the times, and that the people were emerg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from
primitive barbarity.</p>
            <p>Under Edward III, the conſtitution of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and the
whole frame of our government, became reduced into a better form. A ſpirit of
liberty breathes in all his laws: yet, no King knew how to make himſelf more
abſolute. As the father loſt his crown and his life, in the moſt
miſerable manner, by ſuffering himſelf to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by his
miniſters, and protecting them from the reſentments of the people; ſo the
ſon very early exerted his own authority, and freed himſelf from the
guardianſhip, or rather ſubjection, of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Queen, and her
paramour, who had long oppreſſed the nation, and diſhonoured him, by
their ſcandalous conduct. Mortimer was dragged from the Queen's apartment, in
the moſt ignominious manner, while ſhe implored, all the while, that they
would ſpare the gentle Mortimer. But the young King was deaf to her
intreaties; the pity which ſhe once refuſed her unhappy huſband was now
denied her: the parliament condemned Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer to die, without being permitted
to plead, as he had ſerved Spencer ſome time before. He fell by the hands
of the hangman; and Iſabella was confined to the caſtle of Riſings, with
a penſion of three thouſand pounds a year. Her confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſevere,
though ſhe ſurvived her diſgrace twenty-five years, and, abandoned to
univerſal <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0443100201:129"/> contempt, wept in ſolitude rather her
misfortunes than her vices.</p>
            <p>Edward III. well knew, that a conquering Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch was fitteſt to
pleaſe a warlike people. The Scotch had long triumphed with impunity; he
therefore began his reign by reducing them to the moſt diſtreſsful
circumſtances, and once more brought them to acknowledge his ſovereignty
over their crown. But he was ſoon drawn off from theſe conqueſts to
objects of greater victories: a new ſcene began to be opened in France, and
Europe, in ſuſpenſe, began to doubt whether Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward's claims to that
kingdom were ſecured to him by right of inheritance, or by the rights of
conqueſt. France, at that time, was by no means ſo extenſive as at
preſent: it comprehended neither Dauphine, nor Provence, nor Franche Comte.
It was rendered ſtill more feeble, from the nature of its government;
ſeveral powerful neighbours, who pretended to be vaſſals of that crown,
rather ſerved to weaken than ſtrengthen the monarchy.</p>
            <p>The people of that kingdom were unhappy, from their mutual
diviſions; and the King, at that time, was ſtill more ſo. The three
ſons of Philip the Fair, in full parliament, accuſed their wives of
adultery; they were each condemned, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be impriſoned for life.
Lewis Huttin, the eldeſt ſon, cauſed his wife to be ſtrangled; her
lovers died by a new kind of puniſhment, they were flead alive.</p>
            <p>After the death of Lewis Huttin, King of France, a queſtion
aroſe about the validity of the Salic law; a law made in the early period of
French Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, importing, that no woman ſhould rule. As this is a
ſubject of ſome importance in the Engliſh hiſtory, it is neceſſary
to expatiate here a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0443100201:130"/> they had hitherto never
inquired, in France, whether a female could ſucceed in the kingdom. Laws are
only made to regulate what may happen by what has happened already, and, as an
inſtance of this kind had never occurred, there were no laws to direct them.
Precedents, in leſſer inſtances, were the only guides in ſuch a
circumſtance, but theſe precedents had varied with the occaſion. The
parliament of France had often adjudged the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to women; as
Artois was formerly given to a female in prejudice of the male heir. The
ſucceſſion of Champagne had been, on ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, given to the
daughters, and, on others, they were held unqualified to ſucceed. We thus
ſee that right changed with power; and juſtice, in ſuch a caſe, was
either unknown or diſregarded.</p>
            <p>Lewis Huttin left an only daughter, and two brothers: the elder,
Philip the Tall, aſſumed the crown, in prejudice of Huttin's daughter, and
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to cover his uſurpation by the Salic law. The younger brother,
Charles the Fair, jealous of his elder brother's fortune, oppoſed his
preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and aſſerted the daughter's right to ſucceed. This
cauſe was carried before the French parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and decided in favour of
Philip. This Monarch enjoyed the crown but a ſhort time, and, dying, left
only daughters to ſucceed him: Charles the Fair, however, was now of a
diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſentiment from what he had been formerly; he now maintained the
law for the excluſion of females, becauſe it made in his favour. He
ſeized the crown without oppoſition, and enjoyed it for ſome time, but,
dying, left his wife with child. As there was now no apparent heir, the next
heir to the crown was to be regent, and two perſons aſſerted their claim
upon this occaſion: Edward III, <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0443100201:131"/> laid his claim, as
being, by his mother Iſabella, who was daughter of Philip the Fair, and
ſiſter to the three laſt Kings of France, rightful heir to the crown.
Philip Valois, on the other hand, had ſeized upon it, as being the next heir
by the male ſucceſſion. The claims of Philip were preferred; he was
conſtituted regent of France, and, the Queen being unfortunately brought
to-bed of a daughter, he was unanimouſly elected King. He was crowned by his
ſubjects with univerſal ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, had the appellation of Philip
the Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate given him, and to this he added thoſe which might merit good
fortune, virtue and juſtice. Among other inſtances of his felicity, he
might reckon that of the homage paid him by Edward, his rival, which he came to
offer at Amiens: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this homage was ſoon followed by a war, and Edward
diſputed that crown, of which he had juſt before declared himſelf the
vaſſal.</p>
            <p>A brewer at Ghent was one of thoſe who gave the greateſt
aſſiſtance to Edward in this war, and determined him to aſſume the
title of King of France. This citizen's name was James Ardevet, grown too
powerful for a ſubject, and one of thoſe, according to Machiavel, whom
Kings ought to flatter or deſtroy. Thus aſſiſted, Edward made a
powerful invaſion: upon landing, he was chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged by Philip to try their
fortune upon equal terms, in ſome appointed plain. Edward accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the
challenge, for in every action this Prince affected the hero; but, ſome
obſtacles intervening, the war was proſecuted in the uſual manner, by
taking every advantage where it happened to offer.</p>
            <p>In theſe battles there are little materials for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
nor can they afford any thing more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining, than the hiſtory of a
maroding party <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0443100201:132"/> in one of our modern gazettes. It is
ſufficient to obſerve, that ſeveral ſkirmiſhes only drew on the great
and deciſive victory of Creſſy, which every honeſt Engliſhman
boaſts of to this very hour. In this memorable battle, Philip was at the head
of an hundred thouſand men, and Edward only of thirty thouſand. The Black
Prince, his ſon, as yet but a youth of fifteen, commanded the firſt line of
the Engliſh army. The ſecond was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the Earls of Northampton and
Arundel; and the body of reſerve was headed by the King in perſon. He and
the Prince of Wales had that morning received the ſacrament with great
devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his behaviour denoted the calm intrepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of a man reſolved
on conqueſt or death. The army being thus arranged, the King rode from rank
to rank, with a chearful countenance; bad his ſoldiers remember the honour of
their country, while his eloquence animated the whole army to a degree of
enthuſiaſtic expectation. To oppoſe the Engliſh, Philip had drawn up
his formidable army in three diviſions alſo; the firſt commanded by John
of Luxembourg, the blind King of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia; the ſecond was led by the Count of
Alencon, and, Philip, in perſon, commanded the body of reſerve. This was
the firſt battle that the Black Prince had ſeen, but he now appeared
foremoſt in the very ſhock, and continued, for ſome time, to turn the
fortune of the day; but his courage would have been ſoon oppreſſed by
numbers, had not the Earl of Northampton come to his relief. The very
thickeſt of the battle was now gathered round him, and the valour of a boy
filled even veterans with aſtoniſhment: but their ſurprize at his
cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage could not give way to their ſears for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; apprehenſive
that ſome misfortune might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0443100201:133"/> to him in the end,
they ſent the King word to haſten to the Prince's relief. Edward, who had
all this time viewed the engagement from a wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mili, with great deliberation
aſked if his ſon was dead; and, being anſwered, that he ſtill lived and
was giving aſtoniſhing inſtances of valour, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Then tell my Generals,</hi> cried the King,
<hi>that he ſhall have no aſſiſtance from me; the honour of this day
ſhall be his, and he ſhall be indebted to his own merit alone for
victory.</hi>
               </q> Upon this occaſion thirty thouſand of the French were
killed in the field of battle, and the day after they experienced another
defeat. This victory is partly aſcribed to four pieces of artillery, which
the Engliſh firſt made uſe of here, and the uſe of which had been but
lately diſcovered. Edward, after two victories gained in two days, took
Calais, of which the Engliſh remained in poſſeſſion two hundred and
ten years.</p>
            <p>This war, which was at once carried on in three different counties
of France, thinned the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the invaded country, and drained that of
the invaders. But a deſtruction, ſtill more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible than that of war,
contributed, at this time, to deſolate the wretched inhabitants of Europe. A
peſtilence more terrible than any mentioned in former hiſtory, which had
already almoſt diſpeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled Aſia and Afric, came to ſettle upon the
weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern world, with increaſed malignity. The fourth part of the people
were cut off by it: in London it raged with ſuch violence, that in one year's
ſpace there were buried, in Charter-houſe church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, above fifty
thouſand perſons. It was in the midſt of this terrible ſcourge of
nature, that the ambition of Edward and Philip were contending for new
conqueſts, and adding to the calamities of mankind. Theſe ravages, however,
were ſilently <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0443100201:134"/> repaired by commerce and induſtry:
thoſe arts, which were then deſpiſed by Princes, were laying the ſeeds
of future opulence and increaſed popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Theſe arts were travelling,
gradually, from Italy, and had begun to find harbour in England: the
refinements and the pleaſures of ſenſe every day began to improve, but
intellectual refinement was yet unknown: ſenſual enjoyments muſt ever be
carried to ſome height, before man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind can find leiſure or taſte for
entertainments of a more delicate nature.</p>
            <p>During the Engliſh victories on the continent, the Scotch, ever
willing to embrace a favourable opportunity of rapine or revenge, invaded
Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with a numerous army. This unexpected invaſion, at ſuch a
juncture, alarmed the Engliſh, but, however, was not capable of
diſheartening them. Lionel, Edward's ſon, who was left guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of England
during his father's abſence, was yet but a boy, incapable of commanding an
army; but the victories on the continent even ſeemed to inſpire women with
ardour. Philippa, Edward's Queen, took upon her to repulſe the enemy, in
perſon: to that end, heading the troops drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from all parts, with
wonderful expedition, ſhe marched directly againſt the Scots, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them battle. The Scotch King was no leſs impatient to engage: he imagined a
victory would be eaſy againſt undiſciplined troops, and headed by a
woman: but he was miſerably deceived; he had not only the mortification to
loſe the day, but to be made a priſoner by the hands of the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Theſe conqueſts abroad were, however, no way favourable to the
cauſe of liberty at home. As the King became victorious, he neceſſarily
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in independence. The barons, clergy, <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0443100201:135"/> and
people, balanced each other's power; the royal power alone was growing beyond
its bounds. Yet Edward was too ſenſible a Monarch to give open diſguſt;
he was only laying a foundation of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotiſm for his ſucceſſor to
build upon; and, had he been of equal capacity with his father, he might have
ſeized upon public liberty with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But I have tranſgreſſed the
bounds of a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without coming to the concluſion of this Prince's reign;

               <salute>Dear Charles,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have already ſeen how unjuſtly the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſtribute
titles to Kings, before they have deſerved them: you have ſeen the ſecond
Edward called the Father of his country, in the beginning of his reign; and yet
fall, in the end, a miſerable ſacrifice to its reſentment. You have
ſeen Philip Valois, ſirnamed the Fortunate, upon coming to the crown,
ſuffering the moſt ſignal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats, but ſome time after.</p>
            <p>John ſucceeded Philip in the throne of France, but had his
pretenſions conteſted by Edward the Black Prince, who commanded the army of
his father. This young Prince's gallantry, bravery, and modeſty, had won the
affections of his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and he almoſt became invincible at their head.
John, in the mean time, was at the head of a divided and factious nobility; the
govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0443100201:136"/> of France, being under this John, exactly
what that of England had been under a Prince of the ſame name ſome reigns
before. They had their parliaments of barons, deſpotic over their own
hereditary poſſeſſions; and they obliged John of France to ſign a
charter, very much reſembling the Magna Charta, which had been ſigned by
the Engliſh Monarch. The warlike reſources of France and England were,
therefore, at this time very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal. John was at the head of a nobility which
acknowledged no ſubordination amongſt each other: they led their dependant
ſlaves to the fight, and obeyed ſuperior command only as it ſuited their
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; their King might more juſtly be ſaid to command a number of
ſmall armies under diſtinct leaders, than one vaſt machine operating with
uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and united force. The French barons paid their own ſoldiers,
puniſhed their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and rewarded their fidelity. But very
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent were the forces of England: the main body of the Engliſh army was
compoſed of the people, indiſcriminately levied, paid by the King, and
regarding him as the ſource of preferment or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. Inſtead of
perſonal attendance, the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity contributed ſupplies in money; and there
was only ſuch a number of nobles in the army, as might keep the ſpirit of
honour alive, without diminiſhing military ſubordination.</p>
            <p>With an army thus compoſed, the Black Prince advanced to
Poictiers, and ravaged a country that once belonged to his anceſtors. King
John, at the head of ſixty thouſand men, came up to give him battle: the
Engliſh army was in ſuch a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he might readily have
ſtarved it into any terms he thought proper, but he was impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of ſuch
a delay: both generals committed <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0443100201:137"/> unpardonable faults;
the one in being led thus into a defile, the other in not taking a proper
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the ſituation. But, at this age, we muſt not expect Caeſars
or Hannibals to conduct armies; ignorant generals were oppoſed by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
ſtill more ignorant. The battle of Poictiers, which ſoon followed, very
much reſembled that of Creſſy: the ſuperior diſcipline of the
Engliſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my came off victorious, the flower of the French were cut off, and
the King, being wounded in the face, was taken priſoner. A particular, worth
noting, is, that he ſurrendered himſelf to one of his own ſubjects, whom
he had formerly baniſhed, and who now fought for his enemies. Of four ſons
the King of France had with him, the three eldeſt quickly fled, and, by their
cowardice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the defeat of the army: his fourth and youngeſt
ſon, as yet but thirteen years old, ſtill fought by his father, ſtuck
near him in all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes of the field, and, at length, was taken
priſoner by his ſide. This is a remarkable inſtance of the education
Princes then gave their children.</p>
            <p>This victory was, in a great meaſure, owing to the valour of the
Black Prince, but his modeſty, after conqueſt, was ſtill more remarkable.
In the moſt humble manner he remonſtrated with his royal captive, who was
complaining of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, that ſtill he had the comfort left to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that though he loſt the victory, yet his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage deſerved it,
and that a ſubmiſſive deference to his perſon ſhould never be wanting
to make him forget his captivity. In April following, the Prince arrived in
England, bringing his priſoner with him, entering into London in a remarkable
manner. The Prince, upon the left, rode a little black horſe, while the royal
priſoner was mounted <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0443100201:138"/> on a ſtately white charger,
remarkable for its fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture and beauty.</p>
            <p>Two Kings, priſoners in the ſame court, at the ſame time, were
conſidered as glorious conqueſts; but all that England gained by them was
only glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Whatever was acquired in France, with all the ſplendors of
triumph, was ſucceſſively, and in a manner, ſilently loſt, without
even the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a defeat. The treaties that were made with the
captive Kings, as may be eaſily imagined, were highly to the advantage of
their conquerors; but thoſe treaties were no longer obſerved than while the
Engliſh had it in their power to enforce obedience. It is true, John held to
his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as far as was in his power; but, by being a priſoner he
loſt his authority, and his misfortunes rendered him contemptible. Upon his
return from captivity, he not only found himſelf without fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, but at
the head of an exhauſted ſtate; ſoldiers without diſcipline, and
peaſants without law. One of the chiefs of the banditti, upon this
occaſion, aſſumed the title of <hi>The Friend of God, and the Enemy of
Mankind.</hi> A citizen of Sens, called John of Gouge, alſo got himſelf, by
means of robberies, to be acknowledged King, and cauſed as many calamities by
his devaſtations, as the real King had cauſed by his misfortunes. Such was
the ſtate of France upon the arrival of John from England; yet, ſuch was
the abſurdity of this Monarch, that he immediately prepared for a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade
into the Holy Land, before he was ſcarce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed on his throne: had his
exhauſted ſubjects been able to furniſh him out for this chimerical
project, it is probable he would have gone through with it, but their
miſeries were ſuch, as to be even incapable of paying his ranſom; upon
which he <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0443100201:139"/> again returned to England, where he died in
leſs than a year. It is ſaid his paſſion for the Counteſs of
Saliſbury was the real cauſe of this journey; and, indeed, his age, he
being near ſixty, when men too often indulge this prepoſterous paſſion,
and the gallantry of the times ſeem to countenance this opinion.</p>
            <p>If England, during theſe ſhining revolutions, gained any real
advantage, it was only that of having a ſpirit of elegance and honour now
diffuſed through every rank of people. The meaneſt ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier now began to
follow his leader from love, and not compulſion; he was brave from
ſentiment alone, and had the honour of his country beating at his heart, even
though in the humbleſt ſtation. This was the time when chivalry was at the
high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and all the ſucceſſes of England, at this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, were owing
to a concurrence of circumſtances not much regarded by hiſtorians: 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>A romantic nation was led on by a romantic
King.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This ſpirit of chivalry, in ſome meaſure, ſerved to ſoften
the ferocity of the age; it was a mixture of love, generoſity, and war. You
have already ſeen, that the ſons of Princes and the nobility, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of
being bred to arts, or poliſhed by the ſciences, were brought into the
field at an early age, and inſtructed in no other arts, but thoſe of
arms.</p>
            <p>This inſtruction conſiſted in little more than merely how to
ſit on horſe-back, to wield the lance, to run at the ring, to flouriſh at
a tourna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to fall at the feet of a miſtreſs, and attain ſuch
accompliſhments as inured their bodies to bear the fatigues of a campaign.
The rules of tactics, of incampments, of ſtratagems, or ſorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,
were but little minded by any.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0443100201:140"/> Charles the Wiſe, of France, ſoon
therefore, by a finely conducted policy, regained whatever was loſt by John,
his predeceſſor. Edward the Black Prince, emaciated by a lingering
conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, died at the palace of Weſtminſter, in the forty-ſixth
year of his age. England began to wear a face of diſcontent; the public
treaſure was laviſhed without any advantage to the kingdom; the ſubjects
laboured under numberleſs grievances; in ſhort, the kingdom ſeemed now to
feel, that a nation might be at once very victorious and very unhappy. But, to
complete their miſeries, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, their King, was now no longer what he was
in the earlier parts of his reign: he was ſunk into unmanly indolence, and
gave himſelf up to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of looſe deſire, in the arms of a
favourite concubine, called Allice Perrers. His parliament made frequent
remonſtrances againſt this baſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion of himſelf: the parliaments,
at this time, were not as formerly, factions ready to oppreſs public liberty,
but aſſemblies of wiſe and good men, ſedulous for common welfare, and
of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom equal to the rectitude of their intentions; they frequently
remonſtrated againſt the King's and his miniſters conduct; they, at one
time, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence ſufficient to get his concubine removed, but he ſoon
took her back, for the paſſions of age are incurable. In her company he
forgot all the burdens, duties, and fatigues of ſtate, and left the kingdom
to be plundered by a rapacious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry: he did not live to ſurvive the
conſequences of his bad conduct; he died at Shene in Surry, deſerted by
all, even by thoſe who had formerly grown rich by his bounty. Richard II,
ſon of the Black Prince, was conſtituted his ſucceſſor, 
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0443100201:141"/> and came to govern a diſcontented people, a rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
miniſtry, and an impoveriſhed ſtate. Theſe were the calamities
conſequent upon the errors of the preceding reign. Edward III. eſcaped
them, but they fell heavily upon Richard, his ſucceſſor.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE faults of conquerors, as I have already obſerved, generally
fall upon their ſucceſſors. Richard II. came to the throne of his
grandfather, when yet but eleven, and found the people diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and
poor. The gentry were, in fact, luxurious, a ſpirit of profuſion had
entered with the ſpirit of gallantry; this neceſſarily produced indolence
and rapacity among the higher orders of the kingdom, and their wants muſt
neceſſarily produce an oppreſſion of the reſt.</p>
            <p>The regents, however, appointed during the King's minority, ſeemed
no way ſollicitous to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe theſe murmurings. The Duke of Lancaſter,
better known by the name of John of Ghaunt, in the very beginning,
diſguſted the people, by robbing two Knights of a priſoner, which they
had taken in war; and, at the ſame time, ſeveral expeditions againſt the
French and Scotch happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be carried on without ſucceſs. But a new
engagement, entered into by the crown, of aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Portugal, at a time
when the government was inſulted by nearer enemies, raiſed the people's
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. To ſupport this unneceſſary alliance, a ſubſidy was to
be levied by a poll-tax, payable <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0443100201:142"/> by all above the age of
fifteen: this, at laſt, raiſed the people's refentment into an
inſurrection.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the numbers, who by war, by a reſidence in
towns, and by other means, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come free, yet there were ſtill multitudes
in the country who had lands in villenage, that, as yet, were only ſlaves to
their lords from whom they held. Theſe men had ſeen the charms of liberty,
from its effects upon others; and they panted for freedom themſelves. The
luxury and opulence which they ſaw others enjoy, but for which they toiled,
became an incentive to them to ſtruggle for liberty alſo. Several of
theſe had become opulent enough to purchaſe their freedom, but, by an
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt act of parliament, thoſe purchaſes were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared of no validity.
This the peaſants conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an infraction of the laws of humanity, and
ſuch, indeed, it actually was. A parliament of lords, and rich commoners, in
this inſtance, feem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have no regard for the rights of men whom they
conſidered as ſlaves, as if ſome orders of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind were held even too
vile to find juſtice. The minds of the people were, therefore, thus prepared
for ſedition, when the manner of collecting the polltax provoked them to open
revolt.</p>
            <p>We have, in preceding reigns, perceived popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſurrections
only in the towns; we now find the ſpirit of ſeditious liberty ſpreading
into the country. Citizens, at firſt, begin to perceive their own ſtrength,
and next the ſame manner of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is embraced by the peaſant, whom the
ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the laws had annexed to the ſoil. We now begin to find a
knowledge of the rights of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity diffuſed even to the very loweſt of
the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and exerting itſelf in rude and terrible efforts for
freedom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0443100201:143"/> The preſent inſurrection began in
Eſſex, where a report was induſtriouſly ſpread, implying, that the
peaſants were doomed to death; that their houſes would be burned, and their
farms plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. The country people, alarmed at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, roſe in
their own defence, and, their numbers continually increaſing, they advanced
near London, to the number of an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, with banners diſplayed.
At the head of this undiſciplined concourſe was one Walter, by trade a
tyler; he was one of thoſe hardy ſpirits ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently found among the
common Engliſh, ready to face any danger, and ſupport every calamity: in
exacting the poll-tax he had refuſed to pay for his daughter, alledging, that
ſhe was under the age mentioned in the act of parliament. The brutal
collector inſiſted upon her being a full grown wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and, in order to
aſcertain his aſſertions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to acts of indecency; this provoked
the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſuch a degree, that he ſtruck him dead at one blow with his
hammer: Wat Tyler was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſidered as a champion in the cauſe, and
appointed ſpokeſman to the people. It is eaſy to imagine the diſorders
committed by ſuch a tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous aſſembly; they burned and pillaged
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they came, and revenged their former miſeries upon their
maſters, the gentry, to whom they no longer acknowledged ſubjection. After
having entered the Tower, and murdered ſuch as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as enemies,
they divided themſelves into bodies, and took up their quarters in different
parts of the environs of the city. At length, Richard, riding towards
Smithfield, invited them to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, in order to know and remove their
griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances. Wat Tyler juſt entered Smithfield, when the King's Knight
delivered the royal meſſage, <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0443100201:144"/> without alighting, not
imagining he ſhould ſtand upon ceremony: but this haughty demagogue,
whoſe pride began to riſe with his exaltation, was ſo offended at this
want of reſpect, that he was going to kill him, if the King, who was
himſelf advancing, had not ordered him to diſmount. In Wat Tyler's
conference with the King, being both on horſeback, he made ſeveral
propoſals, which, though cenſured by hiſtorians as extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, in
reality breathe nothing but common juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. He deſired that all ſlaves
ſhould be ſet free, and that all commonages ſhould be open to the poor as
well as the rich: whilſt he made theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he now and then lifted up
his ſword, in a menacing manner; which inſolence ſo raiſed the
indignation of William Walworth, mayor of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, who attended the King, that,
without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering to what danger he expoſed his maſter, he ſtunned
Tyler with a blow of his mace, and Sir Philpot, riding up, thruſt his ſword
through his body: his followers, ſeeing their leader on the ground,
encouraged each other to revenge his death, and their bows were now bent for
execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when Richard, though not quite ſixteen years of age, inſtead of
flying, rode up to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, with admirable conſtancy and preſence of
mind, crying out with a reſolute voice, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>What, my lieges, will you then kill your King?
Be not concerned for the loſs of your leader: I myſelf will now be your
general, follow me into the field, and you ſhall have whatever you
deſire.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The rebels immediately deſiſted; they followed the King, as if
mechanically; and the next day received a charter of freedom and a general
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. But theſe were only extorted grants, they were ſoon retracted, the
ring-leaders of the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0443100201:145"/> were tried, convicted of
treaſon, and executed without mercy. The inſurrections of the barons
againſt their King, hiſtorians talk of with no great degree of animoſity;
the inſurrection of the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beians againſt the barons, in the preſent
caſe, is branded with all the virulence of reproach. The puniſhment of the
inſurgent barons, is generally ſtyled cruelty; the puniſhment of men who
fought for native freedom, is called juſtice; but, we muſt be contented
with ſuch miſrepreſentations of facts, till philoſophers can be found
to write hiſtory.</p>
            <p>We now ſee the firſt wrong ſtep in Richard's conduct. He
granted the rebels a charter, by which he gave the ſanction of juſtice to
their claims, but ſoon revoked this charter, which was apparently denying
that juſtice they demanded. By theſe means he diſſipated, indeed, the
combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for that time, but their hatred remained, and was propagated by
the ſeverity of puniſhment.</p>
            <p>By this means Richard had effectually alienated the affections of
the lower orders of people; it now only remained to make the parliament his
enemies. Being come to his ſeventeenth year, he began more plainly to
diſcover his inclinations, which had hitherto been reſtrained by the
authority of his governors: he had been bred up amidſt flatterers, who never
ventured to controul his will; he had ſeen the liberties taken by Edward III.
over his ſubjects, and he fancied he might imitate him in them; but Richard
was not the conqueror of France and Scotland; he was hated by the poor, and
envied by three guardians of great power, who ſecretly deſired his crown:
every error, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the conduct of a King, ſo ſituated, muſt be
attended with dangerous and violent effects; his indolence in repreſſing
the invafions of the <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0443100201:146"/> Scotch, and the machinations of
France, were ſufficient to give diſguſt to his conduct. All his faults
were exaggerated, and his behaviour, even when right, publicly reproved.
Unaccuſtomed to controul, he laid a ſcheme of becoming abſolute, and
governing without his parliament's aſſiſtance or advice. Willing,
however, to colour his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary proceeding with the appearance of juſtice,
he aſked the opinion of the Judges: their opinions have been too often found
to be influenced by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; they gave it as their opinion, that the King
was above law. Yet perhaps they might have been directed by ancient laws, but
cuſtom had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced new modes of thinking, and they did not pay a juſt
deference to her power. This ſentence the Lords oppoſed by declarations,
and, offering various reaſons, were quickly at the head of forty thouſand
men to ſecond their arguments: but, what had ſtill greater weight, they
threatened to chuſe a new King, which ſo operated upon the King's natural
puſillanimity, that he conſented to change his favourite miniſters, who
had adviſed him to extend the royal prerogative; he renewed his
coronation-oath, and the ſame formalities were uſed as at the commencement
of a new reign.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen numberleſs of theſe inſurrections without any
apparent conſequence; the King cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed in one reign, and permitted
to range at liberty in another: the only ſecret, at that time, for a King to
become deſpotic, was to be ever in the field; a warlike Prince might command
the nobility, as they were obliged to follow him in his campaigns; and he might
command the people, from that fondneſs which the vulgar have for a conqueror.
Richard, however, was no way war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; but, being bred up in the luxury and
pride <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0443100201:147"/> of a court, ſtill expected deference and
obedience, which could, at that time, be obtained only by merit in war.</p>
            <p>Having, by the removal of his favourites, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf
ſtill more feeble than before, he now ran into profuſion, and endeavoured
to forget his real weakneſs, in extravagance and luxury. Such expences
neceſſarily created new demands upon the people, and they were bold enough
to refuſe: this neceſſarily produced new inſurrections, and reiterated
puniſhments on the part of the King. Puniſhment and arbitrary proceedings
generally produce but a temporary and fatal ſecurity: Richard, however,
inſenſible of this, imagined that now was the time to render himſelf
deſpotic, and had even influence ſufficient to prevail upon a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
called in the year 1397, to juſtify his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions. By this mercileſs
ſeſſion, ſeveral of the nobility loſt their lives: the Archbiſhop
of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury was baniſhed, the Earl of Arundel put to death, and the Earl
of Warwick ſentenced to quit the kingdom.</p>
            <p>Every thing ſeemed to contribute to ſupport the King in the
acquiſition of his new created power. The moſt forward to oppoſe his
deſigns had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death or baniſhment, and they who ſtill
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, were bribed to acquieſce, by penſions, grants, and places. The
great officers of the crown, the governors of the towns and counties, were all
devoted to his intereſt: yet, all this was but a deceitful ſecurity; this
was a power founded upon intereſt or terror alone, and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on affection;
the people hated him, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the nobles only obeyed him through
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0443100201:148"/> In this manner did this giddy Monarch
ſuffer himſelf to be deluded by vain hopes, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day gave ſome new
inſtance of ſtraining the royal prerogative beyond what it could bear: but
ſoon an opportunity offered to induce the people to refuſe a blind
obedience to his unjuſt commands, and to convince him of his former errors; a
charge happening to be exhibited by the Duke of Hereford againſt the Duke of
Norfolk, for having ſpoken ſeditious words againſt his Majeſty, in a
private converſation; for want of ſufficient proof to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the
accuſation, it was decreed, by the lords in parliament, that the diſpute
ſhould be decided by ſingle combat, according to the laws of chival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
ſtill in faſhion. The time and the place were appointed for the determining
this affair, and the combatants met accordingly. It may not be amiſs to
deſcribe the ceremonies upon that occaſion:</p>
            <p>Hereford, the challenger, firſt appeared, on a white courſer,
gaily capariſoned, armed at all points, with his drawn ſword in his hand:
when he approached the liſts, the Mareſchal demanded who he was, to which
he anſwered, 
<q rend="inline">"I am Henry of Lancaſter, Duke of Hereford, come
hither, according to my duty, againſt Thomas Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray, Duke of Norfolk, a
falſe traitor to God, the King, the realm, and me."</q> Then, taking the oath
that his quarrel was juſt and true, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to enter the liſts; which
being granted, he ſheathed his ſword, pulled down his beaver, croſſed
himſelf on the forehead, ſeized his lance, paſſed the barrier, alighted
and ſate down in a chair of green velvet, placed at one end of the liſts.
He had ſcarce taken his ſeat, when the King came into the field with great
pomp, attended by the peers the Count of St. Pol, who came from France 
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0443100201:149"/> on purpoſe to ſee this famous trial; and ten
thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men at arms to prevent tumults and diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. His Majeſty,
being ſeated in his chair of ſtate, the King at Arms proclaimed, that none
but ſuch as were appoined to marſhal the field, ſhould preſume to touch
the liſts, upon pain of death. Then another herald proclaimed aloud, 
<q rend="inline">"Behold here Henry of Lancaſter, Duke of Hereford,
who has entered the liſts to perform his devoir againſt Thomas Mowbray,
Duke of Norfolk, on pain of being counted falſe and recreant."</q>The Duke of
Norfolk immediately appeared in arms, mounted upon a barbed horſe, with a
coat of arms of crimſon velvet, embroidered with lions of ſilver and
mulberry trees; and, having taken his oath before the conſtable and
mareſchal, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the field, exclaiming aloud, 
<q rend="inline">"God defend the right."</q> Alighting from his
horſe, he placed himſelf in a chair of crimſon velvet, oppoſite to his
antagoniſt, at the other end of the liſts: then the Mareſchal, having
meaſured their lances, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered one to the challenger, and ſent a Knight
with the other to the Duke of Norfolk, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was made that they
ſhould prepare for the combat. They immediately mounted their horſes,
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n cloſed their beavers, fixed
their lances on the reſts; and, the trumpets ſounding a charge, the Duke of
Hereford began his career with great violence, but, before he could join his
antagoniſt, the King threw down his warder, and the heralds interpoſed.
Richard ordered their lances to be taken away, and baniſhed the Duke of
Hereford for ten years, and the Duke of Norfolk for life. Nothing could be a
ſtronger proof of that unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable error, which ever attended this King's
deſigns, than this behaviour: the one was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0443100201:150"/>
to exile, without being charged with any offence; and the other, without being
convicted of any crime. The whole kingdom was diſpleaſed at the
diſappointment, and this determination, in thoſe ferocious times, even
ſeemed to argue cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice in the King. The Duke of Norfolk was overwhelmed
with grief and deſpondence, at the judgment awarded againſt him; he retired
to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, where, in a little time, he died of ſorrow and chagrin. Hereford,
on the contrary, bore his fate with great reſignation, and behaved with
ſuch reſpectful ſubmiſſion, when he went to take his leave, that the
King remitted four years of his exile. From this he withdrew to Paris, where he
met with a favourable reception from the French King, and, in all probability,
would have married the only daughter of the Duke of Berry, had not the match
been interrupted by the interpoſition of Richard, who ſent the Earl of
Saliſbury, as his ambaſſador, to repreſent Hereford as a perſon who
had been guilty of treaſonable practices, and to aſſure the French court,
that he would never be permitted to return to his own country. The Princes of
the blood, alarmed at this declaration, broke off the match abruptly; and, when
Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford expoſtulated with them on the ſubject, made him acquainted with
their reaſons for retracting the aſſent they had already given to his
propoſal. Such complicated injuries could not fail to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the
reſentment of the Duke againſt Richard, which he had hitherto concealed;
and theſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, firſt turned his thoughts upon acquiring the crown of
England. No man could be better qualified for a project of this nature than the
Duke of Hereford: he was cool, cautious, diſcerning, and reſolute; he had
diſtinguiſhed himſelf by his <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0443100201:151"/> courage, both at home
and abroad: he was the idol of the ſoldiery, and the favourite of the
peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: he was immenſely rich, and, by blood or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, connected with
all the noblemen in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The greateſt part of the kingdom not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
murmured, but loudly exclaimed againſt the ſentence of baniſhment which
had been denounced againſt him, and ardently wiſhed for an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of
doing him juſtice.</p>
            <p>It was not long before they were gratified in this particular: his
father, the Duke of Lancaſter, dying in February, the baniſhed Duke of
Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ought to have ſucceeded to his titles and eſtate, by virtue of
his hereditary right, as well as of the letters patent which he had obtained,
even after his ſentence at Coventry. But Richard, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his
former grants, allured by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the prize, by a ſentence no
leſs unjuſt than avaricious, ſeized the deceaſed Duke's effects and
eſtate, and decreed that the ſon's baniſhment ſhould be perpetual. The
laws and liberties of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were now in a moſt deplorable ſtate;
there was ſcarce a man in the kingdom able, though all were willing, to
oppoſe the arbitrary power uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King. Finding himſelf above
all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, he gave himſelf up to a ſoft and effeminate life,
regardleſs of the good of the public. His mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, not to be behind
their Monarch, gave lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle attention to buſineſs, but ſaw, without any
concern, the Engliſh nation fall into the utmoſt contempt. In this
ſituation the people naturally turned their eyes upon the baniſhed Duke, as
the only perſon from whom they could expect redreſs: he was ſtimulated by
private injuries, and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance and intereſt to give weight to his
meaſures. <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0443100201:152"/> The malecontents only waited for the
abſence of the King, to put theſe meaſures into execution.</p>
            <p>For this an occaſion ſoon offered: the Earl of Marche,
preſumptive heir of the crown, having been appointed the King's Lieutenant in
Ireland, was ſlain, in a ſkirmiſh, by the native Iriſh; and Richard was
ſo incenſed at this, that, with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous army, he went over to revenge
his death in perſon. The Duke of Lancaſter, (for this was the title which
the Duke of Hereford aſſumed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his father's death) being informed of
Richard's departure from England, with three ſmall veſſels, landed at
Ravenſpur in Yorkſhire, at firſt only pretending that his ſole aim was
to obtain juſtice. The Earl of Northumberland, who had long been a
malecontent, and Henry Piercy, his ſon, ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Hotſpur, immediately
joined him with ſome troops: after this junction, the concourſe of people
coming to liſt under his banner was ſo great, that, in a few days, his army
was threeſcore thouſand ſtrong; ſo eager were the nobles and people to
put themſelves under the protection of a Prince, who allured them with the
proſpect of freedom.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe things were tranſacting in England, Richard was
in Ireland in perfect ſecurity: the contrary winds, which continued to blow
above three weeks, hindered his receiving any news of the rebellion in his
native dominions; but, when he heard of it, he immediately impriſoned the
Duke of Lancaſter's brothers, whom he had taken over with him; and reſolved
to go immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England, to fight the enemy. Yet, ever wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in his
reſolutions, he was perſuaded to ſtay ſome time longer, till he could
prepare ſhips to tranſport all his forces at once. This delay com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
his ruin: his friends in England had aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0443100201:153"/> an
army of forty thouſand men, who, upon finding the King did not return to head
them at the time appointed, diſperſed. Richard, however, landed in England,
and ſoon perceived his unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſituation: he ſaw himſelf in the
midſt of an enraged people, none of whom he could rely on; forſaken by
thoſe who, in the ſun-ſhine of power, contributed to fan his follies.
Thus, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom to truſt, or where to turn, he ſaw no other hopes
of ſafety, but to throw himſelf on the generoſity of his enemy: he
therefore ſent him word, that he was ready to ſubmit to whatever terms he
thought proper to preſcribe, and that he earneſtly deſired a conference.
For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Duke of Lancaſter appointed a caſtle within about
ten miles of Cheſter, where he came, next day, with his whole army. Richard,
who the day before had been brought hither alone, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrying his rival's
approach from the walls, went down to receive him; while the Duke, after ſome
ceremony, entered the caſtle in complete armour, only his head was bare in
compliment to the fallen King. The King, approaching, received him with the
ſalutation of, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Couſin of Lancaſter, you are
welcome:</hi>
               </q> at which the Duke, bowing three times to the ground, replied
in theſe terms, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>My Lord the King, I am come ſooner than you
appointed, becauſe, your people ſay, you have for one and twenty years
governed with rigour and indiſcretion, ſo that they are very ill
ſatisfied with your conduct; but, if it pleaſe God, I will help you to
govern them better for the time to come.</hi>
               </q> To this declaration the King
made no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Fair Couſin, ſince it pleaſes you, it
pleaſes us likewiſe.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The King was ſoon taught to feel his wretched ſituation; he was
led, triumphantly, through every <pb n="151" facs="tcp:0443100201:154"/> town, amidſt an
infinite concourſe of people, who curſed him and extolled the Duke. Long
live the good Duke of Lancaſter, our deliverer, was the general cry: but, for
the King, to uſe the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatic words of the poet, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>None cry'd, God bleſs him.</hi>
               </q> After
theſe repeated indignities, he was confined a cloſe priſoner in the
Tower, there, if poſſible, to undergo ſtill a greater variety of
ſtudied inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and flagrant contempt. Unhappy Richard, thus humbled,
began to loſe his ſpirits with his power; nor was there any great ſhare
of policy required to induce him to reſign his crown. Upon this reſignation
the Duke of Lancaſter founded his ſtrongeſt claim; but, willing to
fortify his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with every appearance of juſtice, the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was ſoon induced to confirm his claims. The King was ſolemnly depoſed,
and the Duke of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter elected in his ſtead, by the title of Henry IV.
Thus began the conteſt between the houſes of York and Lancaſter, which,
for ſeveral years after, deluged the kingdom with blood; yet, which
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, in the end, to give ſtrength and conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to the
conſtitution.</p>

            <p>NUMEROUS formalities are often uſed by Princes, only to cover
impotence or impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Henry the Fourth, knowing the injuſtice of his
title to the crown, was at leaſt determined to give his coronation all
poſſible ſolemnity. A peculiar oil was uſed upon this occaſion, he
affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great devotion, and every action ſhewed with how much humility he
could be an uſurper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0443100201:155"/> Notwithſtanding the validity of his title,
what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pains he took to ſecure it, was contravert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome, and a
conſpiracy was ſoon formed to replace Richard on the throne. This was
projected by ſeveral noblemen, and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the ſcheme were
committed to writing, each being provided with a copy, ſigned by his
confederates: among other conſpirators the Duke of Aumerle was one, and he
had been one of a conſultation, when it was reſolved, that the King
ſhould be aſſaſſinated at Oxford, at a tournament; but, when that
opportunity offered, he was miſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the number. It happened, at that
time, he was viſiting his father, the Duke of York, and, ſitting at dinner,
let fall a paper from his boſom, which his father took up and examined. The
Duke, finding the contents to be a conjuration againſt the King's life, flew
with the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition to Windſor, to inform his Majeſty of the
plot: the ſon, gueſſing his father's intention, went by a ſhorter way,
and obtained his pardon before his father's arrival, who, ſoon after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
produced the paper with the conſpirators names. Henry, alarmed at this
intelligence, uſed the moſt vigorous efforts to diſpel the riſing
ſtorm.</p>
            <p>The conſpirators had, by this time, dreſſed up one of
Richard's ſervants, named Maudlin, in royal robes, giving out, that he was
the depoſed King, who, having eſcaped from priſon, was come to implore
the aſſiſtance of his ſubjects. Pity is a paſſion for which the
Engliſh have ever been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; Majeſty, in diſtreſs, was
ſufficient to excite all their loyalty and compaſſion, and they flocked
in great numbers round the conſpiring leaders. Their army ſoon became
conſiderable, and encamped near Cirenceſter, while the leaders 
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0443100201:156"/> took up their head quarters in that city: but they were
ſo careleſs, or unexperienced in war, that they neglected to place proper
guards at the gates and the avenues of the place. This the mayor ſoon
obſerved, and, aſſembling four hundred men in the night, he ſecured the
gates, ſo as to exclude the troops that were encamped without the walls: and
then attacked the chiefs within. The Duke of Surry and Earl of Saliſbury, two
of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal conſpirators, were taken, after an obſtinate defence, and
beheaded on the ſpot, by the mayor's order; while the Duke of Exeter, and
Earl of Glouceſter, two more of the party, eſcaped over the tops of the
houſes into the camp, with a view to ſtorm the town at the head of their
forces; but they found the tents and baggage abandoned by the ſoldiers, who,
hearing the noiſe and tumult within, had concluded that a party of the King's
army had privately entered, and, from this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, fled with the
utmoſt precipitation. The two Lords, perceiving it out of their power to
execute their deſign, parted, the better to make their eſcape; but they had
the misfortune to be taken, and, ſhortly after, loſt their heads upon the
ſcaffold.</p>
            <p>If we compare the times, which I now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to give you an idea
of, with thoſe of King John, or thoſe of ſome reigns before him, we
ſhall find a great change, with reſpect to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurgent barons. In the
former period they made frequent inſurrections, were often taken in open
rebellion, but as frequently pardoned; in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod now in view, they were
ſeldom taken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuffering the utmoſt rigour of the law. This
plainly ſhews, how much the power of the barons was ſunk in the courſe of
a couple of centuries. <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0443100201:157"/> This revolution of power is,
notwithſtanding, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and obvious; as the people began to ſhare the
government with the nobles, the King was fixed upon as a third perſon, to
ſecure the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance; and both were contented to make him great, from a
jealouſy of each other. Noblemen were therefore now executed, not as petty
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs but offending ſubjects, and none but Kings were conſidered as
exempt from penal laws.</p>
            <p>In all probability, the ill ſucceſs of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
haſtened Richard's end. One of thoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſins, that are found in
every court, ready to commit the moſt horrid crimes for reward, came down to
the place of this unfortunate Monarch's confinement, and, with eight other
followers, ruſhed into his apartment. The King, concluding their deſign was
to take away his life, reſolved to ſell it as dearly as he could: he
wreſted a poll-ax from one of the murderers, and ſoon laid four of the
number dead at his feet; but he was at length overpowered, and ſtruck dead by
the blow of a battle-ax. Thus died the unfortunate Richard, in the thirty-third
year of his age, while com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for his ſufferings and death made more
converts to his family and cauſe, than ever his moſt meritorious actions
during life had gained him.</p>
            <p>The death of Richard was very ſeaſonable to his ſucceſſor.
The King of France had actually raiſed a vaſt armament, in order to replace
the depoſed Monarch; and ſo much was Henry ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified at his intentions,
that he ordered the Biſhop of Arundel to arm even the eccleſiaſtics of
his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. The preparations of France might have contributed to haſten
the fall of Richard; his death was no ſooner known at the French court, than 
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0443100201:158"/> all thoughts of the invaſion were laid aſide, a
truce for eight and twenty years was concluded between the two crowns, and it
was agreed that Queen Iſabel, who had been married to Richard, but whoſe
marriage had never been conſummated, ſhould return to France, her native
country.</p>
            <p>A kingdom, like England, at that time divided in itſelf, and
ſurrounded by enemies on every ſide, could not expect a peace of any
continuance; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Scotch began to give new diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances; and,
when the armies of England were marched northward, in order to oppoſe their
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions, the Welch roſe to vindicate their ancient liberties. Owen
Glendour, a name among the people of that country, reſpected even to this
day, led them on, and gained ſeveral victories; but his ſucceſſes were
only calculated to procure a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary triumph, and no laſting advantage.
Whatever honour the Engliſh loſt on the ſide of Wales they gained on that
of Scotland: the hiſtories of thoſe times are filled with the petty
victories and defeats on either ſide, in theſe wars; but, as they neither
ſerved to alter nor transfer power, they ſcarce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a place in the
chronicles of a kingdom.</p>
            <p>While Henry was employed in thoſe unavailing campaigns, a more
dangerous ſtrom threatened him from his own ſubjects. He claimed the
pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners that were taken from the Scotch by the Earl of Northumberland, for
himſelf; while the Earl, fluſhed with victory, and conſidering himſelf
as the ſupporting column of Henry's throne, reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his demand. A
ſcheme was laid, in which the Scotch and Welch were to combine their forces,
and aſſiſt Northumberland in elevating Mortimer, as the true heir to the
Engliſh throne. As ſoon, therefore, as the confederates were prepared, the 
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0443100201:159"/> Piercies of Northumberland ſuddenly appeared in arms
in the North: but, the Earl himſelf falling ill, his brother and ſon
marched with his troops to join the Welch, who were advanced as far as
Shropſhire. Upon the junction of theſe two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they publiſhed a
manifeſto, which complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of many real grievances, and aggravated others.
Henry, who had received no intelligence of their deſigns, was extremely
ſurprized at the news of this rebellion: but, fortunately, having an army in
readineſs, he marched towards Shrewſbury to meet the rebels, who were there
encamped. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on coming up to them, propoſals for a mediation were offered,
and ſuch favourable terms promiſed, that it was thought it would end in a
reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but diſtruſt on both ſides ſoon broke off the treaty,
and the battle ſoon began. In this Henry obtained a complete victory; and
Hotſpur, the Earl of Northumberland's ſon, ſo renowned for former
ſucceſſes, was ſlain. Mean time the Earl of Northumberland, being
recovered, was advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a body of troops to reinforce the army of the
malecontents, and take upon him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: but, hearing by the way of his
ſon's and brother's misfortune, he diſmiſſed his troops, not daring to
keep the field with ſo few forces before a victorious army. The King, to
terminate this troubleſome affair as ſoon as poſſible, promiſed the
Earl an abſolute pardon, in caſe he obeyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, menacing him
with utter ruin, ſhould he refuſe the proffered favour. The Earl, finding
himſelf without reſource, choſe rather to throw himſelf upon the King's
mercy, than lead a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious and indigent life in exile: he therefore
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to York, and threw himſelf at the King's ſeet, who punctually
performed his promiſe. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0443100201:160"/> he thought the
criminal was already ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently puniſhed in the death of his ſon and
bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The extinction of one rebellion only ſeemed to give riſe to new:
the Archbiſhop of York, being diſſatisfied, and eager to revenge the
King's death, by whom he was promoted, entered into a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy, with ſome
other lords, to dethrone Henry. Northumberland, though pardoned, was again
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the number; they were, however, once more prematurely diſcovered, and
moſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators died by the hands of the executioner, but
Northumberland had the good fortune to eſcape into Scotland.</p>
            <p>While the kingdom was thus torn by faction, and threatened with
foreign invaſions, a ſtill more terrible calamity threatened it from the
clergy. Since Wickliffe publiſhed his opinions, about the end of the reign of
Edward III, his doctrine was ſo ſpread, that the clergy were in continual
appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of its prevailing: Henry was now to catch at every
aſſiſtance, in order to ſtrengthen his uſurped power; among others,
that of the clergy was not to be deſpiſed; he therefore ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
recommended to his parliament the care of the church's conſervation. How
reluctant ſoever the houſe of commons might be to proſecute a ſect,
whoſe only crime was error, the credit of the court, and the cabals of the
clergy, obtained, at length, an act for the burning obſtinate heretics. This
ſtatute was no ſooner paſſed, than William Sawfre, a follower of
Wickliffe, was burned alive, by virtue of the King's writ, delivered to the
mayor of London. This was the firſt man in England who ſuffered death for
the ſake of religion; but, the fires once kindled, the clergy would not 
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0443100201:161"/> ſuffer them ſoon to be extinguiſhed; they readily
perceived, that a power of burning their enemies would revive that temporal
power which they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed about three centuries before: in this they
were not miſtaken; they again, by this means, renewed their priſtine
authority, but with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that as, in the times of the Saxon
hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchy, their power was founded in the love of the people, in the preſent
caſe, it had its original whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their fears.</p>
            <p>By theſe means Henry ſurvived all his troubles, and the kingdom
enjoyed tranquility. He had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fear from France, diſtracted by its
own inteſtine diviſions: the Welch ſued for peace, the regent of Scotland
dreaded a rupture with England, leſt Henry ſhould ſend home the King of
Scotland, whom he had made his priſoner, and thus terminate the regent's
delegated power. Add to this, the male-contents in England were too
inconſiderable to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing further againſt the government. During
this calm, the King endeavoured to efface the impreſſions of ſeverity,
which his conduct had made upon the people, by affecting a popularity and
regard for the welfare of the ſubject; a never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing method to conciliate
the affection of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in favour of their ſovereign. While he thus
laboured, not without ſucceſs, to retrieve the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation he had loſt,
his ſon, the Prince of Wales, ſeemed bent upon incurring public averſion:
he gave a looſe to all kinds of debauchery, and was ſurrounded by a crew of
profligate wretches, who made a practice of committing he moſt illegal acts
of violence. The father was extremely mortified at this degeneracy in his
eldeſt ſon, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready exhibited repeated proofs of his valour,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and generoſity; virtues which he now ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0443100201:162"/> to renounce; while the ſplenetic and gloomy trembled
at the proſpect of his ſucceeding to the throne. Nevertheleſs, in the
midſt of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, the nobleneſs of his heart ſeemed, at
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, to emerge from the gulph in which it was plunged: one of his
diſſolute companions, having been brought to trial for ſome
miſdemeanor, was condemned, notwithſtanding all the intereſt he could
make in his favour; and he was ſo exaſperated at the iſſue of the
trial, that he ſtruck the Judge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bench. This magiſtrate, whoſe
name was Sir William Gaſcoigne, behaved with the dignity that became his
office; he forthwith ordered the Prince to be committed to priſon: when this
tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action was reported to the King, who was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent judge of
mankind, he could not help ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming, in a tranſport of joy, Happy is the
King, who has a magiſtrate endowed with courage to execute the laws upon
ſuch an offender; ſtill more happy in having a ſon willing to ſubmit to
ſuch chaſtiſement.</p>
            <p>This, in fact, is one of the firſt great inſtances we read in
the Engliſh hiſtory, of a magiſtrate do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtice in oppoſition to
power. The govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was now much changed from what it was in the times, even
of Richard, where Judges were but the miniſters of royal caprice.</p>
            <p>Henry did not long out-live this interview: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his end
approach, he diſpoſed his mind to the duties of devotion, and took the
croſs, fully determined to conſecrate the remaining part of his life in
fighting the cauſe of the pilgrims to Jeruſalem, which was, at that time,
conſidered as the cauſe of heaven. This is not the firſt inſtance we
have ſeen of Princes endeavouring to ſtrike up a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with Providence,
and promiſing to perform <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0443100201:163"/> particular acts of devotion,
upon being indulged with a longer period of exiſtence. He imparted his
deſign to a great council, aſſembled for that purpoſe; and began to
make preparations for the expedition, when his diſorder encreaſed to ſuch
a degree, that he was obliged to lay aſide his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and think of a
voyage of by far greater importance. As his conſtitution decayed, his fears
of loſing the crown redoubled, even to childiſh anxiety; he would not
ſleep, unleſs the royal diadem was laid upon his pillow: one day, being in
a violent paroxyſm of his diſorder, the Prince of Wales took up the crown
and carried it away; but, ſoon after, the King recovering his ſenſes, and
miſſing the crown, he aſked what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of it; and, underſtanding
the Prince had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it off, 
<q rend="inline">"What," ſaid the King to the Prince, with marks of
indignation, "would you rob me of my dignity before my death?"</q> 
               <q rend="inline">No, replied the Prince, "Thinking your Majeſty was
dead, I took the crown as my lawful inheritance; but, now I ſee you alive. I
reſtore it with much more pleaſure, and may God grant you many happy days
to enjoy it in peace."</q> So ſaying, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed the crown upon the pillow;
and, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his father's bleſſing, dutifully retired. The King
was ſurprized with his laſt fit, at his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before the ſhrine of
St. Edward the Confeſſor, in Weſtminſter-abbey, from whence he was
car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Jeruſalem chamber. When recovered from his ſwoon,
perceiving himſelf in a ſtrange place, he deſired to know if the
apartment had any particular name; being told of its appellation, he now
concluded a prophecy fulfilled, which ſaid, that he ſhould die in
Jeruſalem; and, after ſome good inſtructions to his ſucceſſor, he
recommended <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0443100201:164"/> his ſoul to heaven, and ſoon after
expired, on the twentieth day of March, in the forty-ſixth year of his age,
and the fourteenth of his reign.</p>
            <p>Henry, whatever he might have been as a man, was certainly an
excellent King. The govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſumed both a form and liberty under his
adminiſtration: the diſtinction between the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and the people was
rendered leſs conſiderable, and the magiſtrates were leſs arbitrary and
leſs venal.</p>

            <p>THE death of Henry IV. gave his people but little affliction, among
whom he never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired any popularity; but the rejoicings made for the
ſucceſſion of his ſon, Henry V, were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and ſincere. This
Prince was their favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, notwithſtanding the profligacy of his youth: in
the very height of riot and extravagance, he would, ſometimes, give
inſtances of the ſublimeſt virtues. But his courage ſeemed to be what
pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly won their affection and eſteem: at this barbarous period, courage
ſeemed to be regarded as the only virtue; courage and ſuperſtition then
made up the whole ſyſtem of human duty, and ſtamped the character of
heroiſm.</p>
            <p>The people of Europe were, by this time, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated from what they
were even two hundred years before; a continuance of war had blotted out the
very traces of morality. The vices of the clergy had drawn upon them contempt
and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which they returned, not by refo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ming themſelves, but by perſecuting
thoſe who oppoſed <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0443100201:165"/> them. This reign was begun in
attempting to extirpate the hereſy of Wickliffe: John Oldcaſtle, baron of
Cobham, was the moſt conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of this ſect; he was the
King's domeſtic, and ſtood highly in his favour. The Archbiſhop of
Canterbury, therefore, undertook to prejudice him in the royal opinion, and
endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the young Monarch, that fire and faggot were the
only inſtruments that were capable of ſaving an heretic from future
damnation; and that Oldcaſtle's opinions deſerved the ſevereſt
puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the law. The King was, at length, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to talk with
Oldcaſtle in private, and, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him immoveable, gave him up to the fury
of his enemies. Perſecution ever produces thoſe crimes which it endeavours
to aboliſh; Oldcaſtle was condemned, but, eſcaping, was obliged to
become, in fact, that guilty perſon which they had at firſt falſly
repreſented him: he headed a body of malecontents, and refuſed to be
demeanable to royal power. This unhappy man, after a variety of
diſtreſſes, at length fell into the power of his enemies; and never did
the cruelty of man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or the crimes of the delinquent draw down, more
torments than he was made to endure: he was hung up with a chain by the middle,
and, by a ſlow fire, burned, or, rather, roaſted alive.</p>
            <p>Such ſpectacles as theſe, muſt naturally produce a diſguſt
in the people, both to the government and the clergy; but, to turn their minds
from theſe hideous ſpectacles, Henry was reſolved to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of
the troubles in which France was, at that time, involved. Charles, who was then
King of France, was ſubject to frequent fits of lunacy, which totally
diſqualified him from reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: in theſe intervals the ambition of his
vaſſals <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0443100201:166"/> and courtiers had room for exertion, and
they grew powerful from the weakneſs of their King. Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella, of Bavaria,
his wife, was at the head of one faction; the Duke of Burgundy of another: the
faction of the children of the Duke of Orleans was conſiderable; that only,
which held by the King, was feeble. Each of theſe, as they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to
prevail, branded their captives with the names of traitors, and the gibbets
were at once hung with the bodies of the accuſed and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers.</p>
            <p>This was thought a moſt favourable opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to reſcue, from
France, thoſe grants that had formerly been given up by treaty: Henry,
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, invaded that kingdom, with an army of fifty thouſand men. He took
Harfleur, and advanced into a country already rendered deſolate by factions,
and which he now totally laid waſte by a foreign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion: but, tho' the
enemy made but a feeble reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, yet the climate ſeemed to fight for
them, a contagious dyſentery carried off three parts of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's ſoldiers.
In ſuch a ſituation, he had recourſe to an expedient common enough in the
barbarous times I am deſcribing; he challenged the Dauphin to ſingle
combat, offering to ſtake his pretenſions on the event; this challenge, as
might naturally be expected, was rejected; and the French, tho' diſagreeing
internally, now ſeemed to unite at the appearance of foreign danger.</p>
            <p>Henry ſoon began to repent of his raſh inroad into a country,
where diſeaſe, and a powerful ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, every moment threatened deſtruction;
and, therefore, thought of retiring to Calais. In this retreat, which was at
once both painful and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, Henry took every method to inſpire his
troops with courage and perſeverance, and ſhewed <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0443100201:167"/>
them, in himſelf, an example of patience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation. In the mean time
the French army was drawn up to obſtruct his paſſage, nor was there any
poſſibility of his paſſing them without a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; yet, even that could
promiſe but ſmall hopes of victory: his army was waſted with diſeaſe,
their ſpirits worn down with fatigue, deſtitute of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and but
nine thouſand in number, to ſuſtain the ſhock of an enemy amounting to
an hundred and fifty thouſand. This diſparity, as it raiſed the courage
of the French, ſo it impreſſed the Engliſh with terror. So confident
were the French leaders of ſucceſs, that they began to treat for the
ranſom of their priſoners: on the 25th of October, 1415, the two armies
drew up in battle array, early in the morning, near the caſtle of Agincourt.
A narrow ground, flanked on one ſide by a wood, on the other by a rivulet,
was to be the ſcene of action. The Conſtable of France commanded the
French, and Henry, with Edward, Duke of York, the Engliſh: both armies, for
ſome time, kept ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently gazing at each other, as if afraid to begin;
which Henry perceiving, with a chearful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance cried out, My friends,
ſince they will not begin, let us ſet them the example; come on, and the
bleſſed Trinity be our protection: and now the whole army ſet forward
with a ſhout. The French ſtill continued to wait their approach with
intrepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, when the Engliſh archers let fly a ſhower of arrows, three
feet long, which did great execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the French cavalry, advancing to repel
theſe two hundred bow-men, who lay till then conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, riſing on a
ſudden, let fly among them: the Engliſh, ſeeing their confuſion, now
threw by their arrows, and ſell upon them ſword in hand; tho' feeble by
diſeaſe, yet they recompenſed the defect <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0443100201:168"/> by
valour. The French at firſt repulſed the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailants, but they,
reſolving to conquer or die, again burſt in upon the enemy, with ſuch
impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity, that they gave way: in the mean time, a body of Engliſh
horſe, which had been concealed in a neighbouring wood, ruſhing out,
flanked the French infantry; and now a total diſorder began to enſue.</p>
            <p>The firſt line of the enemy being thus routed, the ſecond line
began to march up to interrupt the progreſs of victory. Henry, therefore,
alighting from his horſe, preſented himſelf to the enemy, with an
undaunted countenance; and, at the head of his men, fought on foot, encouraging
ſome, and aſſiſting others. Eighteen French cavaliers, who were
reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to kill him or to die in the attempt, ruſhing forth together,
advanced, and one of them ſtunned him with a blow of his battle-ax; they then
fell upon him in a body, and he was juſt going to ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their blows,
when David Gam, a valiant Welchman, and two more of the ſame country, came to
his aid: they ſoon turned the attention of the French from the King; but,
being over-powered themſelves, they fell dead at his feet. The King had now
recovered his ſenſes, and, more help coming in, the eighteen Frenchmen were
all ſlain; upon which he knighted the brave Welchmen, who had valiantly
fallen in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. The heat of the battle ſtill encreaſing, his
courage ſeemed to encreaſe; and, now, the thickeſt of the battle was
gathered round his perſon: his brother, being fallen down by his ſide,
ſtunned with the blow of a club, he covered him for a while; but, receiving
another blow himſelf, it threw him on his knees: he ſoon, however,
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0443100201:169"/> and his valour ſeemed to inſpire his
troops with fury; they ran headlong upon the enemy, and, by an unexpected
attack, put them into ſuch diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that their leaders could never after
bring them to the charge. The Duke of Alencon, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the ſecond
line, ſeeing it fly, reſolved, by one deſperate ſtep, to retrieve the
day, or fall in the attempt: wherefore, running up to King Henry, and crying
aloud that he was the Duke of Alencon, he diſcharged ſuch a blow on his
head, that it carried off a part of the King's helmet; Henry, not having been
able to ward off the blow, ſoon returned it, by ſtriking the Duke to the
ground; and he was ſoon killed by the ſurrounding crowd, all the King's
efforts to ſave him from their fury being ineffectual.</p>
            <p>The two firſt lines being thus diſperſed, the third refuſed
to aſſiſt them, and marched off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fighting. The King, therefore,
thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus ſure of victory, was ſurprized with an account
that his baggage was plundering by the enemy: juſt ſtruck with an
apprehenſion that the French had rallied, and being ſenſible that the
number of his priſoners was greater than that of his army, he raſhly
ordered all the priſoners to be put to death; which order was accordingly
exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. This ſeverity tarniſhed the glory which his victory would
otherwiſe have acquired: but all the heroiſm, and all the virtues of that
age, are tinctured with barbarity.</p>
            <p>This victory, however great it may appear, was rather oſtentatious
than uſeful: it acquired the Engliſh glory, but not dominion; and while it
ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Henry's intereſt more firmly in the hearts of his ſubjects, it
only ſerved to inſpire him with a love of new conqueſts. With this view,
therefore, he <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0443100201:170"/> returned to England, in order to procure
new ſtores of men and money.</p>
            <p>The war between the two kingdoms, from this period, ſeemed to be
carried on rather by negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, treaſons, plots, and fomented
jealouſies, than by the force of arms. France was but as one vaſt theatre
of crimes, murders, puniſhments, and devaſtation: the Duke of Orleans was
aſſaſſinated by the Duke of Burgundy, and he, in his turn, fell by the
treachery of the Dauphin; while the ſon, deſiring to revenge his father's
death, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Henry as lawful heir to the crown, and a treaty was
concluded between Henry and the young Duke of Burgundy at Troyes, by which he
was acknowledged heir to the crown of France, after the death of Charles, who
ſtill reigned, though, by his diſeaſes, rendered totally incapable of
bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. Catharine, the French King's daughter, was given to Henry in
marriage: and it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that the Dauphin ſhould be brought to an
account for the murder of the late Duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy. Things being adjuſted
in this manner, Henry entered the city of Paris without oppoſition, and there
conducted the government at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; while the feeble Charles was
attended as a King indeed, but with ſcarce even the liberty of a
ſubject.</p>
            <p>The Dauphin, in the mean time, wandered about, a ſtranger in his
own dominions, while Henry returned to London, to raiſe new ſubſidies and
new troops, to ſecure his late conqueſts. His preſence, as might be
expected, inſpired his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with joy, but they, at the ſame time,
could not be much pleaſed with a conqueſt, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed likely to
transfer the ſeat of empire from among them. The parliament, upon various
pretences, <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0443100201:171"/> refuſed him a ſupply equal to his
demands: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he again ſet ſail with a new-raiſed army, and the
Dauphin, upon his appearance, thought fit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to retire. Henry then enters
Paris, and, while Charles had but a ſmall court, he was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a very
magnificent one. On Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunday they dined together in public, the two Kings
and the two Queens, with their crowns on their heads; Charles, indeed,
receiving apparent homage, but Henry commanding with abſolute authority.
After this he prepared to ſtop the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the enemy, who had already
taken ſome towns; but, whilſt he flattered himſelf with a ſpeedy
victory, he was attacked with a fiſtula, which the phyſicians were, at that
time, too unſkilful to treat with judgment. He died at the caſtle of
Vincennes, with the ſame intrepidity with which he lived, and was buried at
Weſtminſter-abbey. His reign, during the ſhort time he lived, which was
but thirty-four years, was rather ſplendid than ſerviceable; the
treaſures of his native country were laviſhed upon conqueſts, that to
them were unprofitable. His military fame acquired him the reputation of every
other good quality; he favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the clergy, and they have returned the debt to
his memory: in general, the good or the erroneous conduct of a Prince appears
rather after his death than during his life-time; and the ſucceſſors of
imprudent Kings are often taxed with errors not their own, as we ſhall
preſently ſee. He died, however, fortunate, by falling in the midſt of
his triumphs, and leaving his ſubjects happy. Charles, who died two months
after him, finiſhed a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reign, long paſt in phrenzy, and by all
France branded with contempt, leaving the moſt miſerable ſubjects upon
earth.</p>

            <p>OUR triumphs, at this time, in France, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſcarce any good
effects at home; as we grew warlike, we became brutal; and, pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after
foreign poſſeſſions, we forgot the arts of cultivating thoſe that lay
nearer home. Our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, inſtead of improving, was daily becoming more
barbarous: Langland and Chaucer, about a century before, ſeemed to have drawn
it from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, and enriched it with new terms and combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; but it
was now relapſed into its former groſſneſs, and no poet or hiſtorian
of note was born in this calamitous period.</p>
            <p>Henry VI, ſucceſſor to Henry V, was not quite a year old when
he came to the throne; and his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions began, ſoon after, to diſpute the
government during his minority. The Duke of Bedford was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, by
parliament, Protector of England, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Church, and Firſt
Counſellor of the King: his brother, the Duke of Glouceſter, was to govern
in his abſence, while he conducted the French war; but ſeveral others
aſpired at this poſt as well as he. The ſecond rank in every kingdom, as
being the moſt powerful, is generally the moſt envied ſituation: the
firſt ſtep his enemies took to render the Duke of Glouceſter odious, was
to accuſe his wife, the Ducheſs, of witchcraft. She was charged with
converſing with one Sir Roger Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingbroke, a prieſt and reputed
necromancer, and one Mary Gurdemain, who was ſaid to be a witch: it was
aſſerted, that, with their aſſiſtance, ſhe made a figure of the
King in wax; this the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers ſaid was placed before a gentle fire, and,
as the wax diſſolved, the King's ſtrength was <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0443100201:173"/>
waſted; and, upon its total diſſolution, his life would be at an end.
This charge Bolingbroke utterly denied; but the Ducheſs confeſſed that
ſhe had deſired the woman to make her a philtre, to ſecure the affections
of the Duke her huſband. Neither their innocence, nor her rank, could
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them: ſhe was condemned to penance and perpetual impriſonment,
Bolingbroke was hanged, and the woman burnt in Smithfield.</p>
            <p>Henry, during theſe conteſts of his miniſters, was, at
firſt, from age, incapable of conducting the reins of government; and, when
he became adult, he was equally incapable, from ignorance and imbecillity.
Whether it was that his gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors had kept him in ignorance, in order to
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long their own power, or whether he was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally weak, hiſtory does not
clearly determine. The Earl of Suffolk, one of thoſe who ſhared the power
at that time, thought the beſt way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the King would be to marry
him to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who was herſelf capable of reigning alone. He had ſtill
another motive, which was to create a new power to oppoſe the Duke of
Glouceſter, who was his enemy, and an obſtacle in the road to his ambition:
to this purpoſe, he fixed upon Margaret of Anjou, daughter of Rene, King of
Sicily, and niece of the King of France. She was a Princeſs of uncommon
reſolution, and great penetration, but entirely without fortune; for which,
it was ſaid, her other good qualities were ſufficient to atone. This match
the Duke of Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter vainly oppoſed; the match went forward, and the new
Queen ſhewed her reſentment, by proving herſelf a formidable enemy,
willing and able to undo him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0443100201:174"/> She firſt began her reign, therefore, with
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving him from the council-board. To palliate this proceeding, perſons
were ſuborned to accuſe him of cruelty and injuſtice: to theſe
accuſations he pleaded his innocence, with ſuch force of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that
the council, though conſiſting of his enemies, were obliged to acquit him.
Still, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Queen, bent upon his ruin, ordered him to be apprehended,
and accuſed before the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſummoned for this purpoſe. As the
people thought him innocent, it was expected he would come off now as he had
before; but, on the day he was to make his defence, he was found dead in his
bed, though without any ſigns of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon his body.</p>
            <p>This violence rendered the Queen and the King equally odious; the
Queen eſpecially was charged with the murder, and the dignity of her
ſtation only ſerved to render her a more conſpicuous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of reproach.
But what ſtill contributed to render the people diſcontented with the
admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, was the indifferent ſucceſs of their arms in France.
Triumphs and conqueſts were ever a means of repreſſing the diſcontents
of the people; but the preſent government, to their quarrels at home, added
the misfortune of being defeated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
            <p>Upon the death of Henry V, the Dauphin of France aſſerted his
claim to the throne of that kingdom, under the title of Charles VII. Nothing
could be more deplorable than his ſituation, upon coming to the crown, of
which he was only the nominal poſſeſſor: the Engliſh were maſters
of almoſt all France. Henry VI. was ſolemnly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with regal power,
by legates from Paris. The Duke of Bedford, with a numerous army 
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0443100201:175"/> in the heart of the kingdom, confirmed his claim, and
the Duke of Burgundy was ſteady in the Engliſh alliance. Wherever Charles
attempted to face the enemy, he was overthrown; he could ſcarcely rely on the
friends next his perſon, and his authority was inſulted, even by his own
ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. In this ſituation, nothing but miraculous aſſiſtance, or
pretended miracles, could ſave him. To the laſt expedient he had
recourſe, and it fully anſwered his intentions: the French, from a
van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed nation, are ſuddenly going to be victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and the
Engliſh, who had been hitherto deemed invincible,, are going to be
every-where worſted, and, at length, totally driven out of the kingdom.</p>
            <p>A gentleman, on the frontiers of Lorrain, whoſe name was
Baudricourt, was the perſon who firſt reſolved to put this happy
impoſture into practice. He fixed upon the ſervant-maid of an inn for this
purpoſe, and ſhe was inſtructed at once to perform the duties of a
warrior and a propheteſs: this was Joan of Arc, the renowned maid of Orleans;
a woman of maſculine ſtrength and courage, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be but eighteen,
but, in reality, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeven years old. She equipped herſelf in the arms
and habit of a man, and it was given out, that ſhe was inſpired: ſhe was
brought before the King, examined by the Doctors of the Univerſity, and they,
either deceived, or willing to aſſiſt the impoſture, affirmed that her
commiſſion was from heaven. The vulgar, as ready to give credit to
inſpiration as to witchcraft, eaſily came into the impoſture, and
acquired new hopes and confidence of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh were, at that time, beſieging the city of Orleans,
Charles's laſt reſource; and were <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0443100201:176"/> upon the point of
becoming maſters of it: Joan undertook to raiſe the ſiege; and, to render
herſelf the more remarkable, ordered a ſword to be brought her, from the
tomb of a Knight buried in the church of Fierbois. She addreſſed the
ſoldiers as a meſſenger from heaven, and aſſured them, that
providence would ſtrengthen their arms. She march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at their head, and
delivered Orleans; routed the Engliſh wherever they oppoſed; propheſied
that the King ſhould be crowned at Rheims, and ſhe herſelf aſſiſted
at the ſolemnity which ſhe had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told. She was preſent at the
coronation, holding in her hand the ſtandard under which ſhe had been ſo
often victorious.</p>
            <p>This chain of ſucceſſes, and the dignity which his late
coronation gave the French King, now entirely turned the ſcale in his favour;
the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh loſt the kingdom by the ſame methods the French had loſt
it before. While Charles united his forces and proceeded with diſpatch, they
were quarrelling among themſelves, and loſing the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for
ſucceſs. In the midſt of the King's good fortune, however, Joan of Arc,
his brave cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, was taken priſoner, as ſhe was protecting the rear of
her men in a retreat. The joy of the Engliſh, upon this occaſion, is not to
be expreſſed; and the Duke of Bedford, their General, thought no method
could be ſo proper to reſtore their loſt courage, as to proſecute his
priſoner for witchcraft. It is a diſagreeable reflection upon human nature,
that Judges almoſt ever determine on the ſide of authority: ſhe was found
guilty by ſeveral Biſhops and the Doctors of the univerſity of Paris. She
was at firſt condemned as a ſorcereſs and an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic, and enjoined to
live, by way of penance, upon bread and water, and to remain in priſon 
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0443100201:177"/> for life. Some time after, under colour of her
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing, ſhe was publicly burnt for a witch. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition adds
virulence to the natural cruelty of mankind, and this cruel ſentence ſerved
only to inflame the hatred between the contending powers, without mending the
cauſe of the Engliſh. In vain the brave Talbot and his ſon ſtrove to
main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the declining intereſt of the Engliſh in France: in the year
1437, the French King made his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant entry into Paris, and, in a ſequel
of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years more, the Engliſh were entirely baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from France.
They only were left in poſſeſſion of Calais and Guienne, and loſt for
ever all the fruits of the victories of Creſſy, Poictiers, and Agincourt.
Such is the end of ambition: the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſequences of their conqueſts
there were to deluge that kingdom with the blood of its ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
inhabitants, and their own.</p>
            <p>It may eaſily be ſuppoſed, that the loſſes of the
Engliſh in France, and the diviſions of their rulers at home, muſt
raiſe factions. In this period of calamity, a new intereſt was revived,
which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have lain dormant in the times of proſperity and triumph:
the Duke of York began to think of aſſerting his right to the crown. This
noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was deſcended, by the mother's ſide, from Lionel, one of the
ſons of Edward III. The reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King was deſcended from John of Ghaunt, a
ſon of the ſame Edward, but younger than Lionel; thus the Duke of York's
claim was prior to that of Henry. The enſign of the Duke was a white roſe,
that of Henry a red. This gave name to the two houſes, whoſe contentions
were now about to drench the kingdom with ſlaughter.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Suffolk and the Queen were now at the head of affairs,
and managed all things with <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0443100201:178"/> unlimited authority. As he
had made his way to power by the blood of Glouceſter, he was reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to
eſtabliſh himſelf by the uſual reſources of tyranny, by cruelty to
his inferiors, and flattery to the Queen. This unjuſt and ill-managed power
firſt drew againſt him the oppoſition of the Duke of York: perhaps the
cauſe of the public was the only motive for his firſt reſiſtance.
Almoſt every malecontent has ſome real, and ſome fictitious cauſes of
complaint: he therefore had recourſe to parliament, and accuſed the Duke of
Suffolk as the ſource of all the nation's diſgraces in France. This
accuſation might have been falſe, but the real motive, which was Suffolk's
power, and the cruel uſe he made of it, was left unmentioned, although it was
true<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> The court, to content the
people, condemned him to baniſhment, and he embarked in a little veſſel
to take his paſſage to France; but he could not eſcape his deſtiny. He
was met in his paſſage by an Engliſh man of war; the Captain, having a
mind to ſearch the ſhip the Duke was in, and finding him there, ordered his
head to be ſtruck off without further delay. There is little in the
tranſactions of theſe times to inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt us on the ſide of either
party: we ſee crimes continually to diſguſt us, and ſcarce a ſhining
cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter or a virtue to animate the narrative.</p>
            <p>By the death of the Duke of Suffolk, his rival, of York, ſaw
himſelf rid of a potent enemy, and found the diſcontents of the people
againſt the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration daily increaſe. Among the inſurrections of
theſe unhappy times, was that headed by Jack Cade, who led a tumultuous body
of forces to London, to redreſs their grievances, and there beheaded the Lord
Treaſurer. The government might readily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the diſaffection of the
populace, by his reception <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0443100201:179"/> from the city of London, who
opened their gates to him: however, upon the King's proclamation, his
adherents, after a day or two, were diſperſed, and he himſelf taken and
ſlain. In the mean time the Duke of York ſecretly fomented theſe
diſturbances, and, pretending to eſpouſe the cauſe of the people, from
his retreat in Wales wrote to the King, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing a reformation in the
miniſtry. His letters of counſel were ſoon backed by an army; he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up to London, but found an unexpected re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe from the city, which ſhut
its gates upon him. In this dilemma he offered to diſband his army, if the
Duke of Somerſet, who was at that time the envied object in power, ſhould
be ſent to the Tower: this requeſt was complied with, contrary to his
expectation; and now, coming to court to accuſe him in perſon, he was
ſurprized to ſee the Duke of Somerſet, who was hid behind the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
ſuddenly coming forth, and retorting the accuſation upon him. York now
perceived his danger, and repreſſed the impetuoſity of his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.
As ſoon as he left the preſence, the King commanded him to be apprehended;
but ſuch was the Duke's authority, or ſuch the timidity of the King's
council, that they ſuffered him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, upon promiſing ſtrict
obedience for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>This reconciliation was only temporary; he ſtill aſpired at the
crown, and, the King falling ill, by his intrigues he had ſufficient art to
be taken into the number of the privy council. This was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal blow to
Henry's intereſts: the Duke of York, now let into a ſhare of the authority,
and ſecure of the affections of the people, carried all before him. The Duke
of Somerſet was ſent to the Tower, and the parliament declared his rival
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0443100201:180"/> of the realm. This power the Duke of York,
for ſome time, enjoyed without controul; till the unhappy King, recovering
from his dizzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as if awaking from a dream, perceived, with ſurprize,
that he was ſtripped of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Margaret, his Queen, did all in her
power to rouze him to a ſenſe of his ſituation: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore began by
depoſing the Duke from his power, who inſtantly had recourſe to arms. The
impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Monarch, thus obliged to take the field, was dragged after his army
to the battle of St. Alban's, where he was routed by the Duke of York, and
Somerſet, his General, was flain. The King, being wounded, and hiding
himſelf in a cottage near the field of battle, was taken priſoner, and
treated with ſeeming reſpect: from thence he was brought along, in triumph,
to London; and the Duke permitting him ſtill to enjoy the title of King,
reſerved to himſelf that of Protector, in which conſiſted all the power
of the crown.</p>
            <p>Henry was now but a priſoner, treated with the forms of royalty;
yet, indolent and ſickly as he was, the title alone ſeemed ſufficient for
him. At laſt his friends induced him once more to re-aſſert his
prerogative: the Duke of York again retired, to reſiſt the deſigns of the
Queen. Mutual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt once more brought their armies to the field, and
the fate of the kingdom was to be decided by the ſword. On the King's ſide,
the Queen ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the only acting General: ſhe ranged the army in battalia,
gave the neceſſary orders, while the poor King w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s led about, from place to place, an involuntary
ſpectator of thoſe martial preparations. The army on the oppoſite ſide
was, in the abſence of the Duke of York, commanded by the Earl of Warwick,
the moſt celebrated General of his <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0443100201:181"/> age: a man formed
for times of trouble, extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly artful, and extremely brave; equally ſkilful
in council and the field, and born to give and to take away kingdoms at
pleaſure. After many battles without effect, and deſigns without
conſequence, both armies, at laſt, met on a plain near Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton: the
Queen's army conſiſted of five and twenty thouſand men, the army of
Warwick of forty thouſand. Never was greater animoſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the chiefs
of an army before; both pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fight for the King, whoſe authority
they equally attempted to deſtroy. While the Queen went about from rank to
rank, the King ſtaid in his tent, waiting the iſſue of the battle with
fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male doubts and apprehenſions: both ſides fought five hours with the
utmoſt obſtinacy, but the good fortune of the Earl of Warwick was
ſuperior to that of the Queen; ſhe was conquered, and had the misfortune to
ſee the King taken priſoner in his tent. Thus Henry was once more brought
back, in triumph, to his capital.</p>
            <p>A parliament was now called to give a face to this ſucceſsful
rebellion. The Duke of York, though formerly contented with the title of
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, now claimed the crown. Our proſpects wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as we riſe: the
cauſe of Henry and the Duke was ſolemnly debated in the Houſe of Peers:
each ſide produced their reaſons for or againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. This was
the firſt time that a true ſpirit of liberty ever appeared to exert
itſelf in England, and in which victory did not determine every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. The
Duke of York, though a conqueror, could not entirely gain his cauſe: it was
deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that Henry ſhould poſſeſs the throne during life, and that
the Duke of York ſhould be his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, to the utter ſecluſion
of the Prince of Wales.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0443100201:182"/> The Queen, to all appearance, ſeemed now
ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtitute of every reſource: but, though ſhe had loſt all,
ſhe yet retained her native perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and intrepidity. She was a woman
of a great mind, and ſome faults; but ambition ſeemed to be what called
them into action. Being now a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive, diſtant from the capital, oppoſed
by a vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious army, and a conſummate General, ſhe ſtill tried every
reſource to repair her diſaſtrous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: ſhe flew to Wales,
animated her old friends, acquired new, and raiſed an army to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her
cauſe. She, and her old enemy, the Duke of York, once more met upon Wakefield
Green, near the caſtle of Sandal: fortune this day turned the victory on her
ſide; the Duke of York was ſlain; the Duke of Rutland, his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſon,
fell in the flight; and the father's head, being cut off, was fixed upon the
walls of York.</p>
            <p>Margaret, being now victorious, marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards London, in order to
give the King his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. The Earl of Warwick, who now was at the head of the
Yorkiſts, ſtill commanded an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in which he led about the captive King
to give a ſanction to his attempts. Another battle was to drench the kingdom
with the blood of its inhabitants: the Queen and the Earl met near St. Alban's,
where the Queen was now again victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; ſhe had the pleaſure to ſee
the General, by whom ſhe was once defeated, now fly in his turn; and, what
added to her glory, ſhe had the fortune to releaſe the King, her huſband,
from his capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. Her triumph was great, though contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with cruelty;
but it was of ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The city of London was to be gained, but
Warwick had already ſecured it in his intereſts: the citizens alſo feared
her tumultuous army, and <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0443100201:183"/> refuſed to open their gates
upon her ſummons. In the mean time, Warwick aſſembled the people in St.
John's fields, and, ſhewing them the ſon of the late Duke of York,
demanded, Whether they choſe to have him or Henry for their King? Upon which,
the people crying out a York, an aſſembly was quickly called, and the young
Duke, being preſent, they elected him King, by the name of Edward IV, and
conducted him, with great cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, to the palace where Henry uſed to lodge
when within the walls of the city.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Queen Margaret collected a great army in the
North, amounting to ſixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men at arms. She was now to ſtrike
her ſtrongeſt blow: the command of this army was given to a perſon who
acted under her directions. On the other ſide Warwick conducted young
Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, at the head of forty thouſand men, to oppoſe her. Both ſides, at
length, met near Santon in the county of York: never was England depopulated by
ſo terrible a day. What a dreadful ſight to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold almoſt an hundred
thouſand men, of the ſame country, fighting to ſatisfy the empty ambition
of one or two weak and empty wretches; murdering each other for an ideot and a
boy: the conteſt only which ſhould wear a crown with diamonds, or wield an
empty ſceptre? Strange infatuation; yet, ſuch as it was, not leſs than
forty thouſand men were left dead upon the field, in aſſerting this
diſpute. Warwick gained a complete victory: Edward IV. was eſtabliſhed on
the throne, and Margaret of Anjou abandoned. She fled, for protection, to
Scotland, with her ſon and huſband, in order to attempt new deſigns for
the recovery of her king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Edward now took down the head of his father from
the walls of York, and put up the <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0443100201:184"/> heads of the conquered
Generals in its ſtead. Each party, as it happened to be victorious, thus
called in the executioner to complete the tragedy begun in the field; and our
cruelty to each other, in civil diſcords, is what has impreſſed
foreigners with an idea of Engliſh cruelty.</p>
            <p>Though wretched as this reign was, yet the art of printing, which
was introduced into it at that time, ſeemed to make amends for a part of its
ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities: William Caxton, a mercer, was the firſt who practiſed the art
at London; he tranſlated ſome books himſelf from the French, and printed
the tranſlations of others. Among the writers of that time were Lord Rivers
and Earl Tiptoft, whoſe labours, however, never ventured higher than
tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation. To judge of the learning of thoſe times by the works of the
laity in the vulgar tongue, we ſhall entertain the moſt deſpicable
opinion of it; yet, when I read the Latin productions of ſome of the
prieſts of that period, I cannot avoid allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the authors no ſmall
ſhare of erudition. The truth is, learning was ſeparated from the
purpoſes of common life, at that time, but by no means unknown or neglected
by the clergy, as we are taught to believe.</p>

            <p>WHATEVER ſide was victorious, in theſe times of civil
ſlaughter, could confirm their injuſtice with the ſhew of authority. The
parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment uſually followed the conqueror, and fixed him upon the throne,
when he had an army to back his pretenſions. Edward was immediately, upon
this victory, confirmed by their unanimous <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0443100201:185"/> approbation,
while Henry and his Queen were to ſeek for new reſources in France and
Scotland. No calamity was able to abate Margaret's perſeverance; though ſo
often overcome, yet ſhe was once more reſolved to enter England with five
thouſand men, granted her by the French King, bringing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Henry
with her to enforce her claims. Her uſual ill fortune attended her; her
little fleet was diſperſed by a tempeſt, and ſhe herſelf entered the
Tweed with no ſmall difficulty. Again, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhe offered her enemy
battle, and was again defeated, near Hexham. The loſs of this battle ſeemed
to deprive her of every reſource: ſhe and her huſband were now obliged to
find ſafety in a ſeparate flight, without attendants, and without even the
neceſſaries of life. The weak unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Monarch, almoſt always
imprudent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently unſucceſsful, thought he could lie
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in England: his error was ſoon attended with the natural
conſequences; he was taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, carried to London with ignominy, and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in the Tower.</p>
            <p>Margaret was rather more fortunate than he, for ſhe eſcaped,
with the Dukes of Somerſet and Exeter, out of the kingdom, and retired to her
father, who, though very poor, ſtrove, as well as he could, to ſupply her
with the mere neceſſaries of life. You are not to ſuppoſe the
miſeries of the great, at thoſe times, were fictitious, as we find them at
preſent; they, in reality, endured every calamity that poverty now inflicts
on the obſcureſt of wretches. Philip de Comines, ſays, he ſaw the Duke
of Exeter following the Duke of Burgundy's equipage, barefoot, and ſerving
for his livelihood as a footman. This was a ſtrange ſituation for a Lord,
who had conducted armies, <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0443100201:186"/> and was allied to Kings and
Princes: but the times were barbarous; the Princes on the coaſts of
Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groland experience ſuch reverſes of fortune at this very day.</p>
            <p>Edward, being now, by means of Warwick, fixed upon the throne,
reigned in peace and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. A ſpirit of gallantry reigned in his court,
mixed with the cruelty which ſeemed the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing feature of
thoſe times of diſcord. In the very ſame palace which one day ſmoaked
with blood, a pageant or a maſk appeared the day ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; and the King
would at once gallant a miſtreſs and inſpect an execution.</p>
            <p>As his amours, however, were likely to diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy his
ſubjects, the Earl of Warwick adviſed him to marry; and, with his
conſent, went over to France to procure him Bona of Savoy, and the match was
accordingly, by his means, concluded. But, whilſt the Earl was haſtening
the negotiation in France, the King himſelf put an effectual ſtop to it at
home, by marrying Elizabeth Woodville, with whom he had fallen in love, and
whom he had vainly ſtrove to debauch. Having thus given War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick real cauſe
of offence, he was reſolved to widen the breach by driving him from the
council. We are apt to hate the man we have offended, as much as the man who
has offended us; Edward was no ſooner eſtabliſhed in ſecurity by
Warwick, than he began to be ungrateful. Warwick, whoſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was equal
to his bravery, ſoon made uſe of both to aſſiſt his revenge: he
ſeduced Clarence, the King's brother, and, to confirm him in his intereſts,
makes him his ſon-in-law: and now, finding his plot ready for execution,
flies into open rebellion. Vengeance ſeemed to be the only motive he had in
view: plots, truces, ſtratagems, <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0443100201:187"/> and negotiations,
followed each other in a rapid ſucceſſion. But Warwick, long acquainted
with intrigue and diſſimulation, was, at laſt, too ſubtle for the young
King: inviting him, by a ſeeming promiſe of compoſition, to his houſe,
he threw Edward off his guard; and Warwick, ſeizing the opportunity, made him
a priſoner.</p>
            <p>Nothing now appeared that could oppoſe War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick's deſigns; he
therefore diſbanded his troops as unneceſſary, and Edward was conſigned
to the cuſtody of the Archbiſhop of York. But ſoon an accident happened
that overthrew all Warwick's expectations: Edward's behaviour, in confinement,
was ſo very obliging, that he got leave, upon ſome occaſions, to hunt in
a park adjoining the place of his confinement; from thence he one day made his
eſcape, by the aſſiſtance of a couple of his friends, and, contrary to
all expectation, inſtantly repaired to York.</p>
            <p>Fortune ſeemed to be for Edward; and, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome troops to
London, the citizens imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately declared in his favour. It is ſurpriſing
to think how one party is ſeen this day at the head of numerous forces, while
the next we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it abandoned, and the adverſe party triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without a
rival: a ſtrong proof of the fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating diſpoſition of the Engliſh.

               </gap>rd now commanded a numerous
army, while Warwick, and his brother Clarence, were attended by a few. The
King, reſolving to take the advantage of their weakneſs, after having
defeated a party command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Lord Wells, and cut off his head, the uſual
method of treating the priſoners of either party, he marched to give them
battle. In this exigence they had no other courſe to take, but to embark, in
order to ſcreen themſelves from impending dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0443100201:188"/>
Having arrived ſafely in France, they now were reconciled to Queen Margaret,
their former enemy; and, returning from France, Warwick once more ſaw
himſelf at the head of no leſs than ſixty thouſand men.</p>
            <p>It was now become Edward's turn to fly the kingdom; and, eſcaping
the dangers of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, of the ſea and of pyrates, he landed ſafely in
Holland. Warwick, in the mean time, advanced to London, and once more poor
paſſive Henry was releaſed from priſon, and placed upon an uſeleſs
throne. Warwick was received, among the people, by the name of
<hi>King-maker:</hi> a parliament was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and confirmed Henry's right; but
they were now only miniſters of the will of the victor.</p>
            <p>Edward, though an exile in Holland, had many partizans at home; and,
after an abſence of about nine months, once more landed at Ravenſpur, where
Henry IV. had landed upon a ſimilar occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Though at firſt he was
coldly received by the Engliſh, yet his army increaſed upon its march, and
his moderation and ſeigned humility ſtill added to the number of his
partizans. London, at this time, ever ready to admit the moſt powerful,
open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her gates, and Henry was again taken from his throne to be ſent back
to his old manſion.</p>
            <p>Warwick at laſt found his party begin to decline, and Clarence,
the King's brother, on whom he had the greateſt dependence, changed to the
other ſide. In this ſtate of uncertainty, he knew no other expedient than
to hazard a battle: he knew his forces to be inferior, but he was conſcious
of the ſuperiority of his own generalſhip. With this reſolution he
marched from St. Alban's, and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advanced to Barnet, within ten miles of
Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, he met Edward, who was marching down <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0443100201:189"/> with a
deſign to fight him. Warwick and Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward were the two moſt renowned
Generals of their age, and now was to be ſtruck the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive blow, that
was either to fix Edward on the throne, or overthrow his pretenſions for
ever. The unfortunate Henry was dragged along to be a ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of the
engagement; happy in his natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity, which ſeemed to opiate all his
afflictions.</p>
            <p>The battle began early in the morning, and laſted till noon: never
did two armies fight with greater obſtinacy and bravery; not honour, but
life, depended upon the iſſue of the conteſt. The example of Warwick
inſpired his troops with more than common reſolution; and the victory, for
a while, ſeemed to declare for him: but his army, by reaſon of a ſlight
miſt, happening to miſtake a body of their own forces for that of the
enemy, fell furiouſly upon them, and this fatal error turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fortune of
the day. Warwick did all that experience, conduct, or valour, could
ſuggeſt, to retrieve the miſtake, but in vain. Finding, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all
hopes gone, he was reſolved to ſell his life dearly to the conquerors; and,
ruſhing, on foot as he was, into the midſt of his enemies, he fell covered
all over with wounds. Thus died the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Warwick, who had made and unmade
Kings at pleaſure, yet who never ſeemed to aſpire at regal dignity
himſelf. Ten thouſand of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhared the ſame fate with him, the
King hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordered that no quarter ſhould be given.</p>
            <p>Margaret, who was ever fruitful in reſources, was, at this time,
returning from France, with her ſon the Prince of Wales, where ſhe had been
negotiating a new ſupply. She had ſcarce time to refreſh herſelf from
the fatigues of her voyage, when ſhe received the fatal news of the death of 
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0443100201:190"/> the brave Warwick, who was then her only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender.
Though ſhe had hitherto bravely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all the attacks of fortune, this
was too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a ſhock for nature to ſupport: her grief now, for the
firſt time, found way in a torrent of tears; and, yielding to her unhappy
fate, ſhe took ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary in an abbey in Hampſhire.</p>
            <p>She had not been here long, when ſhe found ſome few friends
ſtill willing to aſſiſt her fallen hopes. The Duke of Somerſet, the
Earl of Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke, and one or two Lords more, came to offer her their lives and
fortunes: a dawn of hope was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to raiſe her courage, and her
numerous misfortunes gave way to the flattering proſpect of another trial.
She had now fought battles in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every province in England: Tewkeſbury
park was the laſt ſcene, that terminated her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. The Duke of
Somerſet headed her army: a man who had ſhared her dangers, and had ever
been ſteady in her cauſe. He was valiant, generous, and polite, but raſh
and headſtrong: when Edward firſt attacked him in his intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he
repulſed him with ſuch vigour, that the enemy retired with precipitation;
Somerſet, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them routed, immediately purſued, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Lord Wenlock to ſupport him, while he charged: but this Lord diſobeyed his
injunctions, and the forces of Somerſet were over-powered by numbers.
Somerſet now, finding all gone, was unable to govern his rage: he had
depended upon Wenlock; but, when he beheld him inactive, in the very place
where he had firſt drawn up his men, giving way to his tranſport, with his
heavy battle-ax in both hands, he ran upon the coward, and, with one blow,
daſhed out his brains.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0443100201:191"/> After the battle, the Queen, torpid with
griefs was taken priſoner, and afterwards had the miſery of finding her
ſon, the Prince of Wales, in the ſame condition. But this noble youth was
not long in bondage: being brought into the victor's preſence, he appeared
before him with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted majeſty. Edward, ſurprized at the boy's
behaviour, aſked him, How he durſt enter into his dominions without leave? 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>I have entered the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of my father,</hi>
replied the Prince, <hi>to revenge his injuries, and to redreſs my
own.</hi>
               </q> The barbarous Monarch, enraged at his intrepidity, ſtruck him
on the mouth with his gauntlet: this ſeemed to be the ſignal for his death;
Glouceſter, Clarence, and others, like wild beaſts, ruſhing upon the
unarmed youth at once, ſtabbed him to the heart with their daggers. When the
governors of a kingdom behave thus, what muſt be the behaviour of the people?
To complete the tragedy, Henry himſelf, who had long been the paſſive
ſpectator of all theſe cruelties, was now thought unfit to live. The Duke
of Glouceſter, afterwards named Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard III, or the Crouch-back, entering
his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber alone, murdered him in cold blood. Of all thoſe that were taken,
none were ſuffered to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive but Margaret herſelf: it was, perhaps,
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that ſhe would be ranſomed by the King of France, and in this
they were not deceived: Lewis XI. paid the King of England fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
crowns for her freedom, Thus Margaret of Anjou, after having ſuſtained the
cauſe of her huſband in twelve battles, after having ſurvived her fortune
and her children, died a few years after in privacy in France, very miſerable
indeed; but with no other claims to our pity, except her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and her
diſtreſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0443100201:192"/> Of all people in the world the Engliſh are
the moſt compaſſionate; a throne raiſed upon cruelty never wanted
enemies among them, and nothing could ever have been more ridiculous than
attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to govern ſuch ſubjects as the Engliſh by the hand of the
executioner. The heads of either faction ſeemed to have been inſenſible
of this truth, and it was their ill-judged puniſhments, which, by turns,
plunged them into new diſtreſſes. A tyrant, however, when once drenched
in blood, knows not when to give over. Edward, being now freed from great
enemies, turned to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of thoſe of leſſer note: the gibbets
were hung with his adverſaries, and their eſtates confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to his
uſe.</p>
            <p>Yet, while he was thus rendering himſelf ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible on the one
hand, he was immerſed in gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry on the other. Nature, it ſeems, was not
unfavourable to him in this reſpect, for he was univerſally allowed to be
the moſt beautiful man of his time. The court ſeemed willing to
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance thoſe debaucheries, in which they had a ſhare; and the clergy,
as they themſelves prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed every ſpecies of lewdneſs with impunity,
were ever ready to lend abſolution for all his fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The truth is,
enormous vices had been of late ſo common, that adultery was held but a very
ſlight offence: among the number of his miſtreſſes was the wife of one
Shore, a woman of exquiſite beauty and good ſenſe, but who had not virtue
enough to withſtand the temptations of a beautiful man and a Monarch.</p>
            <p>England now enjoying a temporary calm, the King thought the beſt
way to ingratiate himſelf with the people, was to aſſert his right to his
do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in France, which the inſurrections of his <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0443100201:193"/>
father had contributed to alienate in the former reign: this propoſal was
ſure of pleaſing the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, who ever appeared more fond of ſplendid
than uſeful acquiſitions. To proſecute this ſcheme, therefore, he
ſends his ally, the Duke of Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, a reinforcement of three thouſand
men, and ſoon after paſſed over himſelf at the head of a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
army. Lewis XI, then King of France, was, with reaſon, alarmed at this
formidable inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: he found himſelf unable to reſiſt ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
an antagoniſt, and therefore had recourſe to treaty: this ſucceeded
better than arms could have done; the two Kings had an interview at the bridge
of Perpignan, and, upon the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſtipulated ſum, Edward led his
forces back to England. The Engliſh King wanted to return home to his
miſtreſſes, to ſpend upon them the money he had gotten; and the French
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch hoped to be able to refuſe thoſe ſums which he had only given a
promiſe to pay.</p>
            <p>Edward returned to renew his cruelty and his exceſſes. His
brother Clarence, who had aſſiſted him in gaining the crown, had been,
for ſome time, treated with indifference and diſreſpect: this Clarence
thought an ill recompence for his former ſervices, and often gave himſelf
the liberty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective in the King's abſence. In this poſture of things,
the King happened to kill a favourite deer, belonging to Mr. Thomas Burdet, a
friend of the Duk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'s: poor Burdet,
dropping ſome haſty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions againſt the King, was ſentenced to
die, and executed in two days after. The Duke of Clarence, upon the death of
his friend, vented his grief in renewed reproaches againſt his brother: the
King, unmindful of the ties of kindred, or the debt of gratitude, by which he
was bound <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0443100201:194"/> had him arraigned, condemned, and executed: he
was ſmothered in a butt of Malmſey wine. When men arrive at a certain
ſtation of greatneſs, their regards are diſſipated on too great a
number of objects to feel parental affection: the ties of nature are only
ſtrong with thoſe who have but few friends or few dependants.</p>
            <p>The reſt of Edward's life was ſpent in riot and debauchery, in
gratifications that are pleaſing only to the narrow mind; in uſeleſs
treaties, in which he was ever deceived; and in empty threats againſt the
Monarch who had deceived him. His parliament, now merely the miniſters of his
will, conſented to a war with France, at a time when it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it could ſucceed: all the lords unanimouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that they thought it
both juſt and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The people ſeemed equally pleaſed at the
proſpect of a war, which might, in ſome meaſure, alleviate their
domeſtic calamities; great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were made on every ſide, but
Edward died in the midſt of all his expectations. The character of this
Prince is eaſily ſummed up; his good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities were courage and beauty;
his bad qualities—every vice.</p>

            <p>HORRID as the laſt reign was, you muſt prepare for events in the
next ſtill more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. Edward left two ſons, the eldeſt of whom, a boy
between twelve and thirteen, was proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King, by the name of Edward V. The
Queen, his mother, being herſelf newly raiſed among the nobility, ſeemed
willing to hide the meanneſs of <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0443100201:195"/> her former condition
amongſt a number of new promotions: this, as might naturally be expected, was
diſpleaſing to the old nobility; and the Duke of Glouceſter, a monſter
both for the cruelty of his heart, and the deformity of his body, fomented
their diſcontents. Having gained over Lord Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Duke of
Buckingham, and ſome other lords, to his intereſts, he made them a long
ſpeech, tending to ſhew the danger that hung over their heads, if the Queen
ſhould have the government in her hands: he enlarged upon the uſurpations
of her family, and the lengths they would be apt to run upon being inveſted
with the ſupreme power. In ſhort, he ſpared neither diſſimulation nor
arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, nor oaths, to get the guardianſhip of the minority, and the
cuſtody of the King's perſon.</p>
            <p>His firſt ſtep, after being declared Protector of the kingdom,
was to get the King's brother, alſo a boy of about ſeven, who, with the
Queen his mother, had taken ſanctuary in Weſtminſter-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. The Queen
foreſaw the dangers which threatened her family; and, parting with her child,
claſped him, with a laſt embrace, to her breaſt, and took leave of him
with a ſhower of tears. The Duke of Glouceſter, on the other hand, took his
young nephew in his arms, and, claſping him, with feigned affection,
declared, that, while he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was alive, the child ſhould never want a
parent. The young King, finding that he was to have the pleaſure of his
brother's company, was greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced, without conſidering the fatal
intention of theſe preparations: a few days after, the Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, upon a
pretext of guarding them from danger, conveyed them both to the Tower.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſecured their perſons, the Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's next ſtep
was to ſpread a report of their ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimacy; <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0443100201:196"/> and, by
pretended obſtacles, to put off the day of the young King's coronation. Lord
Stanley, a man of deep penetration, was the firſt to diſcloſe his fears
of the Protector's having ill deſigns: he communicated his ſuſpicions to
Lord Haſtings, who was firmly attached to the young King, perhaps this lord's
wiſhes, that ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject might not be true, influenced his judgment,
and confirmed him in his ſecurity. Soon, however, Cateſby, a vile creature
of the Protector's, was ſent to ſound him, and try whether he could not be
brought over to ſide with the projected uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Haſtings appeared
immoveable in his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the King, and his death was therefore
reſolved on.</p>
            <p>With this deſign, the Protector next day called a council in the
Tower, under the pretence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediting the coronation: he came thither
himſelf at nine o'clock in the morning, with a chearful countenance,
ſaluting the members with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt affability, and appearing with
demonſtrations of unuſual good humour; and then, going out for a ſhort
time, deſired his abſence might not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the debates. In about an
hour he returned again, quite altered, knitting his brows, biting his lips, and
ſhewing, by the frequent alterations of his looks, ſome inward
perturbation. A ſilence enſued for ſome time, and the lords looked upon
each other, not without reaſon, expecting ſome horrid cataſtrophe: at
length he broke the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſilence, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>My Lords,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>What puniſhment
do they deſerve who have conſpired againſt my life?</hi>
               </q> This
redoubled the aſtoniſhment of the aſſembly, and, continuing their
ſilence, Lord Haſtings at length made anſwer, That whoever did ſo
deſerved to be puniſhed as a traitor: upon which the Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, 
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0443100201:197"/> with a ſtern countenance, baring his w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arm, cried out, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>See what the ſorcereſs my Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſter,
and that wretch, Shore's wife, have done by their witcherafts! Their ſpells
have reduced my arm to this condition, and my whole body would have ſuffered
the ſame calamity, but for a timely detection.</hi>
               </q> The amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the
council ſeemed to increaſe at this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible accuſation, and Lord
Haſtings again ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">IF <hi>they have committed ſuch a crime, they
deſerve puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> IF,</q> cried the Protector, with a loud voice,
Doſt thou anſwer me with IFS? 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>I tell thee, that they have conſpired my
death; and that thou, traitor, art an accomplice in their crime.</hi>
               </q> Thus
having ſaid, he ſtruck the table twice with his hand, and the room was
inſtantly filled with armed men. 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>I arreſt thee,</hi> continues he, turning to
Haſtings, <hi>for high treaſon;</hi>
               </q> and, at the ſame time, delivered
him to the cuſtody of the ſoldiers.</p>
            <p>The council-room was now filled with tumult; and, though no reſcue
was offered, yet the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers cauſed a buſtle, as if they apprehended
dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. One of them narrowly miſſed cleaving Lord Stanley's head with a
battle-ax, but he eſcaped by ſhrinking under the table: in all probability,
the fellow had orders for this attempt, ſo that, when thus killed, his death
might be aſcribed to the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult cauſed by an intended reſcue. Stanley,
how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, eſcaping the blow, was arreſted by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector's order, who
was well apprized of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the young King. As for Lord
Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, he was forced to make a ſhort confeſſion to the next
prieſt that was at hand; the Protector crying out, by St. Paul, he would not
dine till he had ſeen his head taken off: he was accordingly hurried out to
the little green before the Tower <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0443100201:198"/> chapel, and there
beheaded on a log of wood that acccidentally lay there.</p>
            <p>But not thoſe alone of his council were thus barbarouſly
treated: on the very ſame day a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar tragedy was acted at Pontefract
caſtle, where the Earl Rivers, the moſt polite and gallant man of the age
in which he lived, and Lord Grey, were both beheaded by a decree of that very
ſame coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, the members of which were now in ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger themſelves.
A plot againſt the King was the pretext for their execution; but, in reality,
they died as being the only obſtacles to prevent his deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The Protector, having thus got rid of thoſe he moſt feared,
undertook to puniſh even the leaſt dangerous: Jane Shore, the late King's
miſtreſs, was an enemy too humble for him to fear any thing from her
attempts, yet, as ſhe had been accuſed of witchcraft, of which all the
world ſaw ſhe was innocent, he thought proper to puniſh her for faults of
which ſhe was really guilty. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy woman had been deluded formerly
from her huſband one Shore, a goldſmith in Lombard-ſtreet, and continued
with Edward the moſt guiltleſs miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs in his luxurious and abandoned
court: ſhe ever interceded for the diſtreſſed, and was ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to
as a mediator for mercy. She was cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, generous, and pleaſing in
converſation; her wit and her beauty were ſaid to be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible.
Being blameleſs in other reſpects, the Protector ordered her to be ſued
for incontinency, for having left her huſband to live in adultery with
another. It is poſſible that the people were not diſpleaſed at
ſeeing, again reduced to her former meanneſs, a perſon, who had, for a
while, been raiſed above them, and enjoyed all the favours of 
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0443100201:199"/> the King. Her guilt was too notorious to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied;
ſhe acknowledged the charge, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to walk barefoot through the
city, and to do penance in St. Paul's church in a white ſheet, with a wax
taper in her hand, before thouſands of ſpectators. She lived above forty
years after this ſentence, reduced to the moſt extreme wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs: an
hiſtorian, in the reign of Henry VII, aſſures us, that he ſaw her
gathering herbs in a field near the city, to ſupply her nightly meal; a
ſtrange employment for one who once had been the favourite of a court, and
the miſtreſs of a king.</p>
            <p>The Protector now began to lay aſide his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended regard for the
ſons of the late King, and to aſpire to the throne more openly: to effect
this, the Duke of Buckingham, who by promiſes and bribes was devoted to his
intereſts, tried every art to infuſe into the people an opinion of the
baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardy of the late King, and that of his children. Dr. Shaw, a popular
preacher, was hired to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue the people from St. Paul's Croſs to the
ſame purpoſe: the preacher, after having diſplayed the incontinence of
the Queen, inſiſted upon the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legality of the young King's title, and the
virtues of the Protector. 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>It is be,</hi> continued the ſyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
<hi>who carries in his face, in his ſoul, the image of virtue, and the marks
of a true deſcent.</hi>
               </q> Still, however, the people continued ſilent,
each fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to begin the cry of King Richard, or deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tendency of
his ſermon. The Duke of Buckingham, therefore, next undertook to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
them in his turn: his ſpeech turned upon the calamities of the laſt reign,
and the baſtardy of the preſent pretender; he ſeemed apprehenſive,
indeed, that the Protector could not be prevailed <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0443100201:200"/> upon
to accept the crown, but he hoped that the people would take every method to
perſuade him: he concluded, by deſiring every man to ſpeak his real
ſentiments, and to give a poſitive anſwer, whether they would have the
young baſtard or the virtuous Protector? A ſilence, for ſome time,
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; but, at length, ſome of the Duke's own ſervants, who had
ſlipped in among the preſs, cried out, Long live King Richard: this cry was
ſeconded by ſome of the citizens, who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly bribed; and the
mob at the door, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable claſs of people, ever pleaſed with
novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, repeated the cry; and, throwing up their caps, cried out, a Richard,
a Richard. The Duke, now taking the advantage of this faint ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, next
day, at the head of the Mayor and Aldermen, went to wait upon the Protector,
with offers of the crown. Richard, with his uſual hypocriſy, appeared to
the crowd in a gallery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Biſhops, and, at firſt, pretended to be
ſurprized at the concourſe: when he was informed that their buſineſs
was to offer him the crown, he declined accepting it, alledging his love for
the late King his brother, and his affection for the children under his care.
Buckingham, ſeeming diſpleaſed with this anſwer, muttered ſome words
to himſelf, and, at length, plainly told him, that all the people had
determined upon making him King: that they had now proceeded too far to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, and therefore were reſolved, in caſe of his refuſal, to offer it
where it would meet with a more ready acceptance. This was a reſolution,
which the Protector's tenderneſs for his people could not permit him to ſee
executed: 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>I ſee,</hi> cried he in a modeſt tone, <hi>I
ſee the kingdom is reſolved to load me with preferments, unequal to my
abilities or my</hi> 
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0443100201:201"/> 
                  <hi>choice; yet, ſince it is my
duty to obey the dictates of a free people, I will graciouſly accept their
petition. I, therefore, from this moment, enter upon the government of England
and France, with a reſolution to defend the one, and to ſubdue the
other.</hi>
               </q> The crowd being thus diſmiſſed, each returned home,
pondering upon the proceedings of the day, and making ſuch remarks, as
paſſion, intereſt, or prudence, might ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p>One crime ever draws on others, and uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion naturally required
ſecurity: as ſoon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as he was fixed upon the throne, Richard
ſent the governor of the Tower orders to put the two young Princes to death.
There was yet one man left in the kingdom, who had virtue enough to refuſe
being made the inſtrument of a tyrant's cruelty: the governor of the Tower,
whoſe name was Brackenbury, ſubmiſſively anſwered, that he could not
embrue his hands in their blood. A fit inſtrument, however, was not wanting
long: one James Tyrrel was employed and ſent to command the Tower for one
night. Tyrrel, that very night, whilſt all were aſleep, went to the chamber
where the two young Princes lay; here the murderer, for ſome time,
heſitated in his baſe deſign, ſtruck, as it is ſaid, with the
innocence of their looks: but, habit getting the better of remorſe, he at
laſt ſmothered them between two pillows, and cauſed them to be buried
under a little ſtair-caſe, near where they lay. Vengeance, though late,
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed this execrable wretch; he was executed for this fact in the
ſucceeding reign, when he confeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his crime and the manner of its
execution.</p>
            <p>The warlike ſpirit, firſt excited by the conqueſt of France,
and then kept up by the long civil war, ſeemed to have baniſhed every
ſentiment of <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0443100201:202"/> virtue from the kingdom: cruelty and
executions were grown ſo common, that the people now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came familiar with
blood and death: ſcarce a noble family in the kingdom which was not thinned
by theſe terrible diſſenſions. The clergy ſeemed, at this time, quite
ſeparated from the laity; they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſuffered for treaſon, and were
but little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the bloody politics of the times. As for arts,
ſciences, and commerce, they were totally neglected. In all this carnage and
deſolation, one power was imperceptibly gaining ground; as the lords were
declining, the commons were coming into authority; not ſo much expoſed, as
the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to the tempeſts of regal reſentment, they continued to
increaſe in wealth and favour, and found ſafety from their humility.</p>

            <p>THERE is ſomewhat that peculiarly ſtrikes the imagination in the
tranſactions of this and the preceding reign; I have therefore treated them
with more than uſual prolixity. Our tragic poets ſeem to have been
ſenſible how much theſe ſtrange inſtances of depravation were
ſuſceptible of a poetic dreſs. Every picture of the times is marked with
ſtrong lines, like an African pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, where all is vaſt, wild, and
terrible.</p>
            <p>Richard had, at length, waded through every obſtacle to the
throne, and now began, after the uſual manner of all uſurpers, to
ſtrengthen, by his ill got power, foreign alliances. Senſible alſo of the
influence of pageantry and ſhew upon the minds of the people, he cauſed
himſelf to be <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0443100201:203"/> crowned firſt at London, and then at
York. The clergy he endeavoured to ſecure in his intereſts, by great
indulgences to them, and by his own hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical behaviour.</p>
            <p>But, while he endeavoured to eſtabliſh his power, he found it
undermining, on a ſide from whence he leaſt expected it: the Duke of
Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham, who had been the principal inſtrument in placing him upon the
throne, now began to expect the reward of his adherence. Richard, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, had
given him ſeveral poſts and governments, but denied him a moiety of the
conſiſcated lands of Hereford, to which he had ſome family claims. Very
great obligations between two friends, on either ſide, generally end in
diſguſt: Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham ſuppoſed that his ſervices could never be
over-rewarded; while Richard, on the contrary, was willing to curb his
deſires, which ſeemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe by gratification. Soon, therefore, the
Duke was diſguſted with the new Monarch, and as ſoon conceived a ſcheme
for depriving him of the crown. Doubtful, for a while, whether he ſhould put
in for the crown himſelf, or ſet up another; the latter opinion prevailed,
and he was reſolved to declare for Henry, Duke of Richmond, then an exile in
Bretagne. Henry, of Richmond, was one of thoſe who had the good fortune to
ſurvive the numerous maſſacres of the preceding reigns: he was the only
remaining branch of the houſe of Lancaſter; he was deſcended from John of
Ghaunt, but, by the female line; his right to the throne was very doubtful, but
the crimes of the uſurper ſtrengthened his claims. He had long lived in
exile, and was once delivered up to the ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of Edward IV, and
juſt upon the point of being brought back to England, to ſuffer a cruel 
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0443100201:204"/> death; when the Prince, who had delivered him up,
repented of what he had done, and took him from the ambaſſadors, juſt as
he was brought on ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board. This was the youth whom the Duke of Buckingham
pitched upon to dethrone the tyrant, and a negotiation was commenced between
them for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Richard, in the mean time, either informed by his creatures, or made
diſtruſtful by conſcious guilt, ſuſpected a conſpiracy, and could
not avoid think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Buckingham among the number of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators.
Impreſſed with theſe ſuſpicions, he came to a reſolution of
ſending for him to court, and the Duke's refuſing to come confirmed him in
his belief: but ſoon he had no cauſe to doubt of his treachery, for word
was brought, that the Duke of Buckingham was up in arms. The Duke, having found
that he could diſſemble with Richard no longer, had drawn together ſome
Welch forces, and began to march to the weſtern ſhore, where he had
appointed young Richmond to land. Richard, however, no way diſmayed at the
approaching danger, prepared to meet him with the few forces he then had in
readineſs; but fortune ſeemed to favour the uſurper, and rendered his
preparations, for this time, needleſs. As Buckingham was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, by
haſty marches, towards Glouceſter, where he deſigned to paſs the
Severn, juſt then the river was ſwollen to ſuch a degree, that the
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, on both ſides, was deluged, and even the tops of mountains covered
with water. It held ten days, during which the Welch army could neither paſs
the river, nor ſubſiſt on the other ſide, where they found nothing but
deſolation: at length, compelled by hunger, after having ſuffered a
thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hardſhips, they all diſperſed, and returned 
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0443100201:205"/> home, notwithſtanding the Duke's intreaties ſo the
contrary. In this helpleſs ſituation, the Duke, after a moment's reflexion,
thought the propereſt place of ſafety he could fix upon, was at the houſe
of one Baniſter, who had been his ſervant, and who had received repeated
obligations from his family. No maxim was ever more juſt, than, that there is
no friendſhip among the wicked: Buckingham had himſelf been firſt falſe
to his King, and after to Richard, the creature of his own power; how then
could he expect fidelity from others? A large reward was ſet upon the Duke's
head: the villain Baniſter, unable to reſiſt ſo great a temptation,
went and betrayed his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Sheriff of Shropſhire, who,
ſurrounding the houſe with armed men, ſeized the Duke in a peaſant's
dreſs, and conducted him to Shrewſbury, where he was beheaded, without the
form of a trial, or delay.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Richmond landed in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but, finding his
hopes fruſtrated, by the cataſtrophe of Buckingham, he haſtily ſet
ſail again, and returned to Bretagne. Richard, thus freed from the impending
danger, gave a looſe to cruelty, the favourite paſſion of his breaſt.
In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to expedite his revenge, he gave one Aſhton an unbounded
commiſſion to condemn and execute, upon the ſpot, ſuch as were deemed
by him guilty, or even ſuſpected of guilt. A cruel King never wants a
bloody miniſter: Aſhton executed his commiſſion with the utmoſt
rigour, putting huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to death in preſence of their own wives, and
children before the eyes of their parents. It is ſaid, that, this execrable
wretch being ſollicited by a beautiful woman to releaſe her huſband, who
was a priſoner upon ſuſpicion, he conſented, upon <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0443100201:206"/> her promiſing to grant him a favour of another nature: ſcarce
had the poor creature indulged his brutal deſire, when he brought her out,
and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her huſband, whom, in the mean time, he had given orders
ſhould be hanged upon a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring tree!</p>
            <p>Still, however, the authority of a parliament was wanting, to give
ſanction to the injuſtice of Richard's proceedings: but, in theſe times
of vice and ſervility, that was ſoon procured. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament approved his
proceedings, confirmed the illegitimacy of Edward's children, paſſed an act
of attainder againſt the Earl of Richmond, and all his adherents; and
ſeemed, upon the whole, more diſpoſed to ſlavery, than he to be a
tyrant. One thing more was yet wanting to complete his ſecurity, the death of
his rival: to effect this, he ſent ambaſſadors to the Duke of Bretagne,
with whom Richmond had taken ſhelter, ſeemingly upon buſineſs of a
public nature, but, in reality, to treat with Laudais, that Prince's prime
miniſter, and to induce him to deliver up Richmond. The miniſter was baſe
enough to enter into the nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation; but Richmond, having had timely notice,
fled away into France, and had juſt reached the limits of that kingdom, when
his purſuers came up with him.</p>
            <p>Richard, finding his deſign of ſeizing his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's perſon
without ſucceſs, as his power became more precarious, became, every day,
more ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and more cruel. Lord Stanley, who was now married to the
widow of Edward IV, fell ſtrongly under his ſuſpicion; and, to ſecure
his fidelity, he took the ſon as an hoſtage for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's good
behaviour. He now alſo reſolved to get rid of his preſent Queen, in order
to marry his <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0443100201:207"/> own niece; a match from which he expected
to derive ſeveral advantages. The Lady he was then married to was formerly
the wife of the young Prince of Wales, that was murdered by him at
Tewkeſbury. It is no ſlight indication of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity of the times to
find a woman thus taking the murderer of her huſband for her ſecond lord.
She felt, however, the conſequences of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to the deceaſed
Prince, in the inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the preſent: Richard treated her with ſo much
contempt and indifference, that ſhe died of grief, according to his deſire.
But his wiſhes were not crowned with ſucceſs in his applications to his
niece; ſhe treated his vile paſſion with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliated contempt and juſt
deteſtation.</p>
            <p>In the perplexity, cauſed by this unexpected re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, it was,
that he received the news of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's being once more landed at
Milford-haven, with an intent to deprive him of the crown: but, being informed
that he brought with him but two thouſand men, he ſeemed to deſpiſe the
effort, and iſſued orders to oppoſe him with the greateſt coolneſs
and intrepidity. Richard was poſſeſſed of courage and military conduct,
and theſe were his only virtues. Having heard that Richmond was marching with
his little army to London, he was reſolved to meet him on the way, and end
the pretenſions of one, or the other, by a battle. Richmond, though very much
inferior in number, was not leſs defirous of engaging; ſo that the two
armies ſoon met at Boſworth field, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine a diſpute that had now,
for more than thirty years, drained England of its braveſt ſubjects.</p>
            <p>Richard, perceiving his enemy advance, drew up his army,
conſiſting of about thirteen thouſand men, in order of battle; he gave
the command of <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0443100201:208"/> the van-guard to the Duke of Norfolk, and
led the main body himſelf, with the crown on his head, either deſigning by
this to inſpire the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with awe, or to render himſelf conſpicuous to
his own army. The Earl of Richmond, who had not half the number of men, drew up
his forces alſo in two lines, the Earl of Oxford com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the firſt, and
he himſelf the ſecond: Lord Stanley, in the mean time, poſted himſelf
in one flank between the two armies, and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther took his ſtation in the
other, which was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite. Richard, ſeeing him thus in a ſituation
equally convenient for joining either army, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent him orders to
join him, which the other refuſing, he gave inſtant command for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading
Lord Stanley's ſon, whom he had kept as an hoſtage; but, being perſuaded
to poſtpone the execution till after the fight, he complied, and immediately
ordered the trumpets to ſound to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. The two armies approaching each
other, the battle began with a ſhower of arrows, and ſoon the two ranks
began to cloſe: this was what Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley expected, who immediately, profiting
himſelf of the occaſion, joined the line of Richmond, and turned the
fortune of the day. In the mean while, Richard ſpurred up his horſe into
the thickeſt of the fight, and Richmond quitted his ſtation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, to
encourage his troops, by his preſence in the front. Richard, perceiving him,
was willing to end all by one blow; and, with the fury of a lion, flew through
thouſands to attack him. He ſlew Sir William Brandon, the Earl's
ſtandard-bearer, who had attempted to ſtop his career; Sir John Cheney,
having taken Brandon's place, was thrown to the ground: Richmond, in the mean
time, ſtood to oppoſe him; but, the crowd inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, 
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0443100201:209"/> they were ſeparated. Richard now, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, went to
inſpire his troops at another quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but, at laſt, perceiving his army
every-where yielding or flying, and now finding that all was gone, he ruſhed,
with a loud ſhout, into the midſt of the enemy, and there met a better
death than his actions had merited: after the battle his body being found
amidſt an heap of ſlaughter, ſtripped naked, covered over with wounds,
and the eyes frightfully ſtaring, was thrown acroſs an horſe, the head
hanging down on one ſide and the legs on the other, and ſo carried to
Leiceſter. It lay there two days, expoſed to public view, and then was
buried without farther ceremony.</p>
            <p>Richard's crown, being found, by one of the ſoldiers, in the field
of battle, was immediately placed upon the head of the conqueror; the whole
army, as if inſpired, with one voice, crying out, Long live King Henry. Thus
ended the bloody reign of Richard; and, by his death the race of the
Plantagenet Kings, that had been in poſſeſſion of the crown during the
ſpace of three hundred and thirty years, became extinct. Thus ended alſo
the conteſts between the houſes of York and Lancaſter, which had, for
thirty years, been as a peſtilence to the kingdom, and in which above an
hundred thouſand men loſt their lives, either by the executioner, or on the
field of battle.</p>
            <p>Theſe diſſenſions had reduced the kingdom to a ſtate of
almoſt ſavage barbarity; laws, arts, and commerce were entirely neglected
for the practice of arms; and to be a conqueror was ſufficient, in the eyes
of the people, to ſtand for every other virtue. They had, as yet, no idea of
pacific government, nor could lend applauſe to thoſe who cultivated it,
and, except only in their gallantry <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0443100201:210"/> to the fair ſex,
they little differed from the ancient painted inhabitants of the iſland. In
theſe wars the women, though never ſo formidable, or never ſo active,
unleſs accuſed of witchcraft, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from capital puniſhments,
which probably proceeded from a ſpirit of gallantry, the ſingle virtue of
the times. As for the clergy, they were entirely diſtinct from the laity,
both in cuſtomes, conſtitutions, and learning: they were governed by the
civil law, drawn up by one of the Roman Emperors; whereas the laity were
governed by the common law, which was traditionally deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them from
their anceſtors. The clergy, however you may be told to the contrary,
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and wrote Latin tolerably well; the laity, on the other hand,
underſtood no Latin, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves wholly to French, when they
aſpired to the character of politeneſs. The clergy, as a body, little
intereſted themſelves in the civil polity, and perhaps were not
diſpleaſed to ſee the laity, whom they conſidered not as
fellow-ſubjects, but rivals for power, weakening themſelves by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
conteſts: the laity regarded the clergy with blind veneration, and this
veneration leſſened their regard for their King. In ſhort, as there was
no virtue among the individuals of the nation, the government was like a
feveriſh conſtitution, ever ſubject to ferment and diſorder. France
ſerved, for a while, as a drain to the peccant humours; but, when that was no
longer open, the diſorder ſeemed to increaſe in the internal part of the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and produced all the horrors of civil war.</p>

            <p>IT was in this ſtate of the nation that the Earl of Richmond, who
took the name of Henry VII, came to the throne. You are now to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold one of
the greateſt revolutions, that ever was brought about in any kingdom,
effected by the prudence, clemency, and perſeverance of one great Prince: a
nation of tumult reduced to civil ſubordination; an inſolent and factious
ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy humbled; wiſe laws enacted; commerce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; and the
peaceful-arts rendered amiable to a people, for whom before war only had
charms. In a word, you are now to turn to a period, where the whole government
ſeems to put on a new form; and to view the actions of a King, if not the
greateſt, at leaſt the moſt uſeful, that ever ſat upon the Britiſh,
or any other throne. Hitherto you have only read the hiſtory of a barbarous
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, obeying with reluctance, and governed by caprice; you are henceforth
to view more refined politics, and better concerted ſchemes; to behold human
wiſdom, as if rouzed from her lethargy of thirteen hundred years, exerting
every art to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the natural ferocity of the people, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
happineſs.</p>
            <p>Henry's firſt care, upon coming to the throne, was to marry the
Princeſs Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV, and thus unite the intereſts of
the houſes of Lancaſter and York: but, leſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould
ſuppoſe he claimed the crown upon the ſtrength of this alliance, he
deferred her corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> two
years after, by which he made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the priority of his own claim. His reign
happily commenced with an obedience to the laws <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0443100201:212"/> that had
been hitherto unknown in England. An act had been paſſed, in the preceding
reign, for the attainder of his friends and followers: this act ſtill
continued in force, and many members of that houſe, by which it was to be
repealed, were thoſe who were mentioned in the attainder. To ſuffer ſuch
to join in repealing that ſtatute would be admitting them judges in their own
cauſe, to which Henry bravely and juſtly objected: they were, therefore,
obliged to leave the houſe, till an act was paſſed to reverſe their
attainder.</p>
            <p>Before his reign, it was uſual, when any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was attainted,
to take away his life, and give away his fortune to ſome court favourite:
Henry wiſely perceived that this had two bad effects; it firſt excited
reſentment, by its cruelty; and, in the next place, only made the favourite
too powerful for ſubjection. This prudent Monarch took a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter method to
repreſs tumult and rebellion: he deprived ſuch as were caught in arms of
their eſtates and fortunes, and theſe he reſerved for the uſe of the
crown. By this means he deprived them of the power to injure him, and he
ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the ſinews of government, by enriching the crown. A great
part of the miſeries of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors proceeded from their poverty,
and the opulence of the nobility. Henry ſaw that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney alone could turn the
ſcale of power into his own hands, and therefore hoarded up all the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcations of his enemies with the utmoſt frugality. Avarice, upon
theſe motives, is not only excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but praiſe-worthy; it is not
meanneſs, but oeconomy; and, whatever hiſtorians tell us of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality in
a King, is, at beſt, miſplaced applauſe. Such liberalities are, in
general, extorted from the poor, the induſtrious, and the uſeful; and
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0443100201:213"/> as rewards, upon the rich and powerful;
perhaps upon the ſycophants of a court, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers of debauchery. Henry
was different from his predeceſſors in this reſpect; he gave away few
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the courtiers about his perſon, and none but the poor ſhared
his benefactions. He releaſed all the priſoners for debt in his dominions,
whoſe debts did not amount to forty ſhillings, and paid their creditors
from the royal coffers. His oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my rendered him not only uſeful to the
poor, but enabled him to be juſt to his own creditors, either abroad or at
home. Thoſe ſums which he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the city of London, or any of his
ſubjects, he repaid at the appointed day, with the utmoſt punctuality; and
thus, as he grew juſt in his own dominions, he became reſpectable
abroad.</p>
            <p>Immediately after his marriage with Elizabeth, he iſſued out a
general pardon to all ſuch as choſe to accept it; but thoſe lords, who
had been the favourites of the laſt reign, and long uſed to tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulence,
refuſed his proffered tenderneſs, and flew to arms. Lord Lovel, Humphrey
and Thomas Stafford, placed themſelves at the head of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection:
Henry ſent the Duke of Bedford to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the inſurgents, with orders to
try what might be the effects of a proffered pardon, previous to his attempts
to reduce them. The Duke punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually obeyed his inſtructions, but the rebels
ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to liſten to no accommodation: but, contrary to all expectation,
Lord Lovel, apprehenſive of being deſerted by his followers, firſt
ſhewed them the example, and fled away to Flanders. The rebel army, now
without a leader, ſubmitted to the mercy of the King, which they received.
The Staffords, who were in the mean time beſieging <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0443100201:214"/>
Worceſter, hearing of the ſurrender of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, attempted to
take ſanctuary in a church which had no privilege to protect them: being
taken from thence, the eldeſt of the brothers was executed, the other
received a pardon.</p>
            <p>But the people were become ſo turbulent and factious, by a long
courſe of civil war, that no governor could rule them, nor any King pleaſe.
One rebellion ſeemed extinguiſhed only to give riſe to another: the King
kept, at that time, a ſon of the Duke of Clarence, who had been formerly
drowned in the butt of wine, as has been mentioned, a priſoner in the Tower.
This poor youth, who was ſtyled the Earl of Warwick, had long been a
ſtranger to liberty; he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with men and things, and ſo
little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with common life, from his long and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confinement,
that he knew not the difference, to uſe the words of the hiſtorian, between
a duck and an hen. This unhappy boy, harmleſs as he was, was made an
inſtrument of to deceive the people: a prieſt, of Oxford, had trained up
one Lambert Simnel, a baker's ſon, to counterfeit the perſon of this Earl;
and he inſtructed him to talk upon ſome facts and occurrences relative to
the court of King Edward. Thus, having prepared him for his purpoſe, he ſet
out for Ireland, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the propereſt theatre to open the ſcene: the
plot unfolded to his wiſh, Simnel was received and proclaimed King of
Ireland, and he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, by the people and judges, with great pomp to
the caſtle, where he was treated conformably to his pretended birth and
diſtinction.</p>
            <p>The King could not avoid being troubled at this impoſture,
becauſe he ſaw his mother-in-law at the bottom of it: he was reſolved,
therefore, to <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0443100201:215"/> take the advice of his council upon this
occaſion, who, after due deliberation, determined upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the old
Queen to a monaſtery; but, to wipe off the aſperſion of treaſon, from
one to whom he was ſo nearly allied, he gave out that ſhe was thus
puniſhed for having formerly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up the Princeſs, her daughter, to
King Richard. The people, as uſual, murmured upon this occaſion; but the
King, unmindful of their idle clamours, perſiſted in his reſolution, and
ſhe remained in confinement till ſhe died, which did not happen till ſome
years after. The next reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the King's council was to ſhew the
Earl of Warwick, who was ſtill confined in the Tower, publicly to the people:
in conſequence of this, he was led through the principal ſtreets of London,
and conducted, in a ſolemn proceſſion, to St. Paul's, where great numbers
were aſſembled to ſee him. Still, however, they proceeded at Dublin to
honour their pretended Monarch, and he was crowned, with great ſolemnity, in
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Earl of Kildare, the Chancellor, and other officers of
ſtate. Such impofitions upon the people were very frequent, at that time, in
ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of Europe: Lorrain, Naples, and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, had their
impoſtors, who continued, for a long time, to deceive without detection. In
fact, the inhabitants of every county were ſo much confined to the limits of
their own peculiar place of abode, and knew ſo little of what was paſſing
in the reſt of the world around them, that nothing was more eaſy than to
deceive. King Simnel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now joined by Lord Lovel, and one or two lords
more of the diſcontented party, reſolved to paſs over into England, and
accordingly landed in Lancaſhire: from thence he marched to York, 
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0443100201:216"/> expecting the country would riſe and join him as he
paſſed along. But in this he was deceived; and he ſoon had the
mortification to find that the King himſelf was coming up with a ſuperior
force to give him battle: the event of the conteſt was ſuch as might have
been expected; the Earl of Lincoln, who commanded for Simnel, was overthrown
and ſlain in battle, and the impoſtor himſelf taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. Henry
had now an opportunity of ſhewing the humanity and the greatneſs of his
mind: Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel was pardoned, and given a mean employment in the King's kitchen,
and afterwards preferred to be one of his falconers, in which poſt he died.
As for the prieſt, his inſtructor, he was made a priſoner for life.</p>
            <p>Things being thus adjuſted, we may turn to France, which had long
been the grave of the Engliſh, who yet coveted nothing ſo much as to
continue the war there. Henry had all along perceived the futility of
conqueſts upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, conqueſts that could produce no other
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages than military glory: but, while he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally deſpiſed ſuch
pernicious triumphs, he was obliged, in order to gain popularity, to
counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance them. He therefore often pretended, that he was going to raviſh
his kingdom once more from the uſurper, and lay all France in blood; but, in
fact, he had nothing farther from his heart. As far as negotiations and threats
went, he did all that lay in his power to keep the jarring ſtates of that
kingdom nearly balanced, and conſequently feeble; but, as for ſuccours of
men and money, he too well knew the value of both to exhauſt them, in the
manner of his predeceſſors, upon ſuch vain projects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0443100201:217"/> The parliament, however, was taught to
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he intended ſomething conſiderable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt France; and
they, ever chearful when France was to be oppoſed, furniſhed him with the
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſupplies. But money was, at that time, more eaſily granted
than levied in England. A new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection aroſe when the ſupplies came
to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and the Earl of Northumberland was kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the mob of
Yorkſhire, while he attempted to enforce obedience to the laws. The mutineers
did not ſtop here; by the advice of one John a Chamber, an incendiary, they
ſet Sir John Egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont at their head, and marched towards London to give the
King battle: the conſequence of this raſh ſtep was the defeat of the
rebels, and the death of John a Chamber, their ring-leader. It was
neceſſary to treat this man with rigour, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a more ready compliance
to the future grants of parliament, and prevent all inſurrections on the
ſame occaſion; for now people ſeemed continually more willing to revolt
than to pay their taxes.</p>
            <p>One would not have imagined, by the ſucceſs of Simnel's
impoſture, that it could have produced imitations; but the old Ducheſs of
Burgundy, ſiſter to Edward IV, finding the former fraud had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo
many, was reſolved to project a new ſcheme, with more art and greater
plauſibility. She firſt ſpread a report, that the young Duke of York,
ſaid to have been murdered in the Tower, was ſtill alive; and ſoon a
youth made his appearance that took upon him the title of the Duke of York. The
perſon pitched upon to play this part was called Peter Warbeck, the ſon of
a Flemiſh Jew, a youth of a beautiful perſon, good underſtanding, and
poſſeſſing ſomething in his carriage and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner far above his birth
or circumſtances. The <pb n="215" facs="tcp:0443100201:218"/> King of France, ever attentive
to ſow the ſeeds of diviſion in England, received him at his court, and
gave him proper encouragement; but, at the interceſſion of Henry,
diſmiſſed him, upon the proſpect of a peace. Having quitted France,
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin went to ſeek protection from the Ducheſs of Burgundy, taking the
greateſt care to conceal his former acquaintance. At their firſt meeting,
the Ducheſs pretended much diſpleaſure at his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in
aſſuming the title of her nephew; but ſoon after, as if brought over by
conviction, ſhe owned him for the Duke of York, and gave him a guard
ſuitable to that dignity. The Engliſh, ever ready to revolt, gave credit to
this new im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, and the young man's prudence, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and
deportment, ſerved to confirm what their credulity had began. All that were
diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the King prepared to join him, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thoſe
that were formerly Henry's favourites, and had contributed to place him on the
throne, thinking their ſervices could never be ſufficiently repaid, were
now the chief heads of the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. Theſe were joined by numbers,
ſome gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of novelty, ſome blindly attached to their leaders, and ſome
induced, by their deſperate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, to wiſh for a change.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the King's enemies were thus combining to involve the
kingdom in its former calamities, he himſelf was no leſs intent upon
preventing the impending danger. He endeavoured to undeceive the people,
firſt by ſhewing that the Duke of York was really dead, and by puniſhing
his murderers; and next by tracing Perkin, the impoſtor, to his primitive
meanneſs: the laſt of theſe projects was not eaſily executed, for
Warbeck's parents and place of abode were ſo well concealed, that it was 
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0443100201:219"/> almoſt impoſſible to come to a knowledge of them
But Henry, at length, won over Sir Robert Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, who was then accompanying
the impoſtor in Flanders, and had been entruſted with his and the
Ducheſs's ſecrets. From Clifford the King learned, not only their
deſigns, but the names of the conſpirators, and had ſeveral of them
arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: his former lenity, however, did not exempt him from freſh
ingratitude: he found that the Lord High Chamberlain, brother to the famous
Lord Stanley, who had been lately created Earl of Derby, was among the number
of thoſe who now had conſpired againſt him. Though this nobleman had been
loaded with favours, and was even then poſſeſſed of an immenſe
fortune; yet, ſtill diſſatisfied, he ſought for more, from his
country's calamities. He was therefore arreſted by the King's order, and,
confeſſing his crime, was ſentenced to ſuffer that death he ſo
juſtly merited. You have hitherto obſerved how difficult it was to rule the
Engliſh at this time; each province ſeemed deſirous of placing ſome
particular family upon the throne, and more eagerly took up arms, than
willingly diſpoſed themſelves to legal ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To mix lenity
with juſtice, upon proper occaſions, required a very nice diſcernment:
Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhewed his judgment in this particular; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a conſpirator took
up arms againſt him, from a conſcientious adherence to principle, and from
a love of the houſe of York, he generally found pardon; but, if the only
motive of his conſpiring was a love of change, or an illicit deſire to
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert thoſe laws by which he was governed, he was then treated with more
ſeverity.</p>
            <p>While Warbeck's adherents were thus diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in England, he
himſelf attempted landing <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0443100201:220"/> in Kent, but, being beat off
from that coaſt by the inhabitants, he went from thence to Ireland: find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his hopes fruſtrated there alſo, he went next to try his ſucceſs in
Scotland. Here his fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to mend; James III, who was then King of that
country, received him very favourably, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> pretenſions to be juſt, and
ſoon after gave him, in marriage, a daughter of the Earl of Huntley, one of
the moſt beautiful and accompliſhed ladies of her time. But, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with theſe inſtances of favour, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to attempt ſetting him
upon the throne of England: it was expected, that, upon Perkin's firſt
appearance in that kingdom, all the friends of the houſe of York would riſe
in his favour: upon this ground, therefore, the King of Scotland en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the
country with a ſtrong army, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the young adventurer wherever he
went; but, contrary to expectation, he found none to ſecond his claims; and,
thus diſappointed, he again retreated back to Edinburgh, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to reſide, till, upon the concluſion of a treaty of peace between the two
kingdoms, he was once more obliged to leave Scotland, and to ſeek for a new
protector.</p>
            <p>Perkin had now, for the ſpace of five years, continued to alarm
the King; he had been acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in France, Flanders, Ireland, and
Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as lawful heir to the Britiſh crown, and had made ſome bold
attempts to ſecond his pretenſions. The time, at length, came, that he was
to act the ſame character in England which he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed elſewhere with
ſo much ſucceſs. Some months before this there had been an inſurrection
in Cornwall: the inhabitants of that diſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, upon levying the taxes
granted by parliament, <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0443100201:221"/> reſuſed to contribute to
expences which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined for the defence of an oppoſite part of the
kingdom. Every inſurrection now was followed with a project of dethroning the
King; they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marched, with one Flammock, a lawyer; Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diley, a
carrier; and Lord Audley, at their head; directly to London, and incamped upon
Black-Heath. The King's forces there ſurrounded and attacked them; the battle
was bloody, two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of theſe poor deluded wretches were killed upon
the ſpot, and the reſt forced to ſurrender at diſcretion. Lord Audley,
and one or two of their ring-leaders, were executed; but the reſt, to the
number of four thouſand, diſmiſſed home again in ſafety. But this
moderation had not the proper effect upon minds too ignorant for gratitude;
they attributed the King's clemency to fear, and, upon returning home, induced
their friends to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the whole kingdom was ready to riſe to
vindicate their quarrel. It was now, therefore, determined to ſend for Perkin
Warbeck, who was then in Ireland, to put himſelf at their head: Perkin did
not heſitate to accept their invitation; and, taking upon him the command,
choſe for his privy council one Hern, a broken mercer; Skelton, a taylor; and
Aſtley, a ſcrivener. He publiſhed a proclamation alſo againſt Henry,
in which he took the title of Richard IV; and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn together a body of
three thouſand men, attempted to ſtorm the city of Exeter, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Henry, having received advice of his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſaid merrily,
that he ſhould now have the pleaſure of viſiting a perſon whom he had
long wiſhed to ſee, and then took the neceſſary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to oppoſe
him. Perkin, on the other hand <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0443100201:222"/> ſeeing that the King
was marching to attack him, loſt all courage, and, in the night, took
ſanctuary in the monaſtery of Bewley. Soon after, upon promiſe of a
pardon, he ſurrendered himſelf to the King, and was confined in the Tower;
but, eſcaping from thence, and finding it impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to get out of the
kingdom, he again took ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary in the monaſtery of Bethlem. The Prior of
this houſe gave him up to the King, upon promiſe of a pardon; and Perkin
was now a ſecond time confined in the Tower: but, plotting, even there,
againſt the King, he and the Earl of Warwick being convicted of deſigns to
kill the keeper of the Tower, and ſo eſcape, they were both put to
death.</p>
            <p>There was as yet, in Henry's reign, nothing but plots, treaſons,
inſurrections, ingratitude, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, and puniſhments. You have ſeen
ſeveral of theſe ſomentors of treaſon brought to juſtice, yet
infinitely greater numbers pardoned; but there was a wide difference between
the puniſhments of this, and thoſe arbitrary ſentences of the reigns
preceding: the courts of judicature now ſat upon every criminal, uninfluenced
by the royal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and ſcarce one perſon was puniſhed for
trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but ſuch as would, at preſent, receive the ſame rigorous
treatment. A King, who can reign without ever puniſhing, is happy; but that
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch muſt certainly be undone, who, through fear, or ill-timed lenity,
ſuffers repeated guilt to eſcape without notice. When a country becomes
quite illicit, puniſhments then, like the loppings in a garden, only ſerve
to ſtrengthen the ſtock, and prepare for a new harveſt of virtues.</p>

            <head>LETTER XXVIII.</head>
            <p>YOU have hitherto only ſeen Henry employed in ſuppreſſing
rebellion, and bringing the kingdom from a ſtate of anarchy to juſt
ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: let me now exhibit that part of his reign in which he moſt
deſerves our admiration, and ſhew him as the friend of peace, and the
refined politician. Indeed no man loved peace more than he, and much of the
ill-will of his ſubjects aroſe from his attempts to repreſs their
inclination for war. The uſual preface to his treaties was, That, when
Chriſt came into the world, peace was ſung; and, when he went out of the
world, peace was bequeathed. He had no ambition to extend his power, except
only by treaties, and by wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; by theſe he rendered himſelf much more
formidable to his neighbours, than his predeceſſors had done by their
victories. They were formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble only to their own ſubjects; Henry was
dreaded by rival Kings.</p>
            <p>He all along had two points principally in view, one to depreſs
the nobility and clergy, and the other to humanize and raiſe up the populace.
From the ambition of the former, and the blind dependence of the latter, all
the troubles in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reigns aroſe; every nobleman was poſſeſſed of
a certain number of ſubjects, over whom he had an abſolute power, and, upon
every occaſion, could influence numbers to join in revolt and
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.</p>
            <p>He firſt, therefore, conſidered, that giving theſe petty
Monarchs a power of ſelling their eſtates, which before they had not a
right to do, would greatly weaken their intereſt. With this view he 
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0443100201:224"/> got an act paſſed, in which the nobility were
granted a power of alienating their poſſeſſions; a law infinitely
pleaſing to the commons, nor was it diſagreeable even to the nobility,
ſince they thus had an immediate reſource for ſupplying the waſte of
prodigality and the demands of their creditors. The blow reached their
poſterity alone, but they were too ignorant to be ſenſible of remote
ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>His next ſcheme was to prevent their giving li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries to many
hundreds of dependents, who ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, like ſtanding forces, to be ready at
the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of their lord. By an act paſſed in his reign, none but
menial ſervants were permitted to wear a livery, under ſevere penalties;
and this law he took care to enforce with the utmoſt rigour. It is told us,
by Bacon, that the King, one day paying a viſit to the Earl of Oxford, was
entertained, by him with all poſſible ſplendor and magnificence. When the
King was ready to depart, he ſaw ranged, upon both ſides, a great number of
men, dreſſed up in very rich liveries, apparently to do him honour. The
King, ſurprized at ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of domeſtics, as he thought them, cried
out, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>What, my Lord of Oxford, are all theſe fine
fellows your menial ſervants?</hi>
               </q> The Earl, not perceiving the King's
drift, anſwered, with a ſmile, that they were only men whom he kept in pay
to do him honour upon ſuch occaſions. At this the King ſtarted a little,
and ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>By my faith, my Lord, I thank you for your good
chear, but I muſt not ſuffer to have the laws broken: my Attorney-General
muſt talk with you.</hi>
               </q> The hiſtorian adds, that the King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted a
ſevere fine for this tranſgreſſion of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0443100201:225"/> It has been already obſerved what a
perverted uſe was made of monaſteries, and other places appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to
religious worſhip, by the number of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals who took refuge in them. This
privilege the clergy aſſumed as their undoubted right; and thoſe places
of pretended ſanctity were become the abode of murderers, robbers, and
conſpirators. Witches and necromancers were the only perſons who could not
avail themſelves of the advantages of the ſecurity theſe afforded: they
whoſe crimes were only fictitious, were the only people who had not the
benefit of ſuch a retreat. Henry uſed all his intereſt with the Pope to
aboliſh theſe ſanctuaries, but without effect; all that he could procure
was, that, if thieves, murderers, or robbers, regiſtered as ſanctuary-men,
ſhould ſally out and commit freſh offences, and retreat again, in ſuch
caſes they might be taken out of the ſanctuary, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up to
juſtice.</p>
            <p>Henry politically pretended the utmoſt ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to all
the Pope's decrees, and ſhewed the greateſt reſpect to the clergy, but
ſtill was guided by them in no ſingle inſtance of his conduct. The Pope,
at one time, was ſo far impoſed upon by his ſeeming attachment to the
church, that he even invited him to renew the cruſades for recovering the
Holy Land. Henry's anſwer deſerves to be remembered: He aſſured his
Holineſs, that no Prince in Chriſtendom would be more forward than he to
undertake ſo glorious and neceſſary an expedition; but, as his cominions
lay very diſtant from Conſtantinople, it would be better to apply to the
Kings of France and Spain for their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and that, in the mean
time, he would come to their aid himſelf, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>as ſoon as all the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the
Chriſtian Princes were brought to an end.</hi>
               </q> 
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0443100201:226"/>
This was, at once, a polite refuſal and an oblique reproach.</p>
            <p>Henry had ſeen the fatal conſequences of having favourites, and
therefore reſolved to have none; he even excluded, from his privy council,
all ſuch as, by their titles or fortune, might attempt to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern him
inſtead of executing his intentions. His council was compoſed of private
men, who had learning and wiſdom to adviſe, but neither influence nor
ambition to govern.</p>
            <p>But, while he was thus employed in lowering his nobility and clergy,
he was uſing every art to extend the privileges of the people. In former
reigns they were ſure to ſuffer, on whatever ſide they fought, if they
had the misfortune to loſe the victory: this rendered each party deſperate,
in caſes of civil war; and this was the cauſe of ſuch terrible
ſlaughters. He therefore procured the paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an act, by which it was
eſtabliſhed, that no perſon ſhould be impeached or attainted for
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the King <hi>for the time being,</hi> or, in other words, him
who ſhould be then actually on the throne. This excellent ſtatute ſerved
to repreſs the deſire of civil war, as ſeveral would naturally take arms
in defence of that ſide on which they were certain of loſing nothing by a
defeat, and their numbers, would intimidate inſurgents.</p>
            <p>But his greateſt efforts were directed to promote trade and
commerce, becauſe this naturally intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a ſpirit of liberty among the
people, and diſengaged them from their dependence on the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. Before
this happy aera, all our towns owed their original to ſome ſtrong caſtle
in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, where ſome great lord generally reſided; and theſe
alſo were made uſe of as priſons for all <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0443100201:227"/> ſorts
of criminals. In this alſo there was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a garriſon, or a number of
armed men, who depended on the nobleman's bounty for ſupport. The number of
theſe, of courſe, drew all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers, victuallers, and
ſhop-keepers, to ſettle in ſome place adjacent, in order to furniſh the
lord and his attendants with what neceſſaries they wanted. The farmers
alſo and huſbandmen, in the neighbourhood, built their houſes there, to
be protected againſt the numerous gangs of robbers that hid in the woods by
day, and infeſted the country by night, who were called Robertſmen. Henry,
on the other hand, endeavoured to bring the towns from ſuch a neighbourhood,
by inviting the inhabitants to a more commercial ſituation. He attempted to
teach them frugality and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of debts, the life and ſoul of induſtry,
by his own example; and never omitted the rights of commerce in all his
treaties with foreign Princes.</p>
            <p>About this time the whole world ſeemed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove: Sweden,
France, and Spain, enjoyed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Monarchs, who encouraged and protected
the riſing arts. The Portugueſe had ſailed round the Cape of Good Hope,
and Columbus had made the diſcovery of America. Henry, in imitation of them,
gave a patent to ſome Briſtol and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe merchants to go in queſt
of new coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. But an accident gave him a better oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of improving
commerce, than his moſt ſanguine hopes could have aſpired to: the King of
Spain and his Queen, being upon their return to their own dominions, after the
concluſion of a ſucceſsful war in Holland, were driven, by a ſtorm,
upon the coaſts of England. As ſoon as Henry had notice of their arrival,
he received them both with marks of the ſincereſt friendſhip 
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0443100201:228"/> and reſpect, meditating, in the mean time, how to make
his ſubjects reap ſome advantage from the accident. He therefore treated
them with a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor which was by no means agreeable to his own nature; and,
while he kept them thus entertained with a round of pageantry and amuſements,
he concluded a treaty of commerce, which has, even to this day, continued to be
beneficial to his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity.</p>
            <p>He now, at length, ſaw his country civilized; the people paid
their taxes without inſurrections; the nobility learned a juſt
ſubordination; the laws alone were ſuffered to paſs ſentence; towns
began to ſeparate from the caſtles of the nobility; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce every day
increaſed; foreigners either feared England, or ſought its alliance, and
the ſpirit of faction was happily extinguiſhed at home. He was at peace
with all Europe, and he had iſſued out a general pardon to his own
ſubjects. It was in this ſituation of things that he died of the gout in
his ſtomach, having lived fifty-two years and reigned twenty-three. Since the
times of Alfred, England had not ſeen ſuch another King. He rendered his
ſubjects powerful and happy, and wrought a greater change in his kingdom,
than it was poſſible to expect could be effected in ſo ſhort a time. If
he had any fault, it was, that, having begun his reign with oeconomy, as he
grew old, his deſires ſeemed to change their object, from the uſe of
money, to the pleaſure of hoarding it; but we can eaſily him, as he only
ſaved for the public, the royal coffers being then the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treaſury of
the ſtate; and, in proportion to the King's ſinances, the public might be
ſaid to be either rich or indigent.</p>

            <p>NEVER did Prince come to the throne with a conjuncture of ſo many
fortunate circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in his favour as Henry VIII, who now took upon him
the government of the kingdom. His prudent father left him a peaceable kingdom,
prudent miniſters, and a well ſtored treaſury. All factions were
extinguiſhed, and all diviſions united

               </gap>n his perſon: he by the father's
ſide claimed from the houſe of Lancaſter, and by the mother's from the
houſe of York. He was at peace with all Europe, and his ſubjects were every
day growing more powerful and more wealthy: commerce and arts had been
introduced in the former reign, and they ſeemed to find in England a
favourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. The young King himſelf was beautiful in perſon,
expert in polite exerciſes, and loved by his ſubjects. The old King, who
was himſelf a ſcholar, had him inſtructed in all the learning of the
times, ſo that he was perfectly verſed in ſchool divinity at the age of
eighteen.</p>
            <p>Yet, from this beginning, you muſt not expect to read the
hiſtory of a good Prince. All theſe advantages were either the gifts of
nature, of fortune, or of his father; with all theſe happy talents, Henry
VIII. wanted the two great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites in forming every good character;
wiſdom and virtue. The learning he had, if it might be called by that name,
ſerved only to inflame his pride, but not controul his vicious affections.
The love of his ſubjects was teſtified by their adulations, and ſerved as
another meteor to lead him aſtray. His vaſt wealth, inſtead of relieving
his ſubjects, or increaſing his power, only contributed to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply 
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0443100201:230"/> his debaucheries, or gratify the rapacity of the
miniſters of his pleaſures. But happy for him, had his faults reſted
here: he was a tyrant; humanity takes the alarm at his cruelty, and, whatever
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate events might have been the conſequence of his deſigns, no good
man but muſt revolt at the means he took for their accompliſhment.</p>
            <p>The firſt act of injuſtice which marked his reign, was his
proſecution of Empſon and Dudley, the Judges whom his father had
conſtituted to inquire into caſes of treaſon, and levy fines
proportionable to the offence. Their conduct was examined, but, nothing being
found againſt them that could amount to a capital conviction, a falſe
accuſation was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and they were convicted of having plotted againſt
the new King, and received ſentence to be beheaded, which was executed
accordingly.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Judges had been long hated by the people, though
apparently without cauſe; they only put the laws in execution againſt
criminals, and, inſtead of their lives, deprived the guilty of their
fortunes. This action of an unjuſt compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with popular clamour was
followed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtill more detrimental to the nation, yet more
pleaſing to the people: the ſpirit of chivalry and conqueſt was not yet
quite extinguiſhed in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; France was ſtill an object of deſire,
and Henry was reſolved once more to ſtrike
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the crown. It was in vain that
one of his old pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent counſellors objected, that conqueſts on the
continent would only be prejudicial to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that England, from its
ſituation, was not deſtined for extenſive empire; the young King, deaf to
all remonſtrances, and perhaps inſpired by the voice of the people,
reſolved to lead an army into that kingdom. The conſequence of the
cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign <pb n="228" facs="tcp:0443100201:231"/> was an uſeleſs victory and an empty
triumph. The French fled without fighting; a truce was concluded between the
two Kings, and Henry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home to diſſipate, in more peaceful follies,
the large ſums which had been amaſſed for very different purpoſes by
his father.</p>
            <p>But, while he thus changed from one pleaſure to another, it was
requiſite to find out a miniſter and favourite, who would take care of the
kingdom. Indifferent Princes ever attempt to rule, and are ruled by favourites,
and ſoon a proper perſon was found to anſwer the King's intentions in
this particular: the man I mean was the famous Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Wolſey; and, as a
great part of this reign was <hi>ruled</hi> by him, his hiſtory may, with
propriety, make a part in that of his maſter. Thomas Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey was the ſon
of a private gentleman (and not of a butcher, as is commonly reported) in
Ipſwich: he was ſent to Oxford ſo early, that he was a bachelor at
fourteen, and from that time called the boy bachelor. He roſe, by degrees,
upon quitting college, from one preferment to another, till he was made rector
of Lymington by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of Dorſet, whoſe children he had inſtructed.
He had not long reſided <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> this

being drunk and raiſing diſturbances in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>air. This diſgrace, however, did
not retard his promotion; he roſe, by degrees, till he was, at laſt,
entruſted with negotiating an intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed marriage between Henry VII. and
Margaret of Savoy. His diſpatch, upon that occaſion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him the
deanery of Lincoln; and in this ſituation it was that Henry VIII. pitched
upon him as a favourite, and entruſted him with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of
affairs. Preſently after his being <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0443100201:232"/> introduced at court
he was made a Privy Counſellor, and, as ſuch, had an opportunity of
ingratiating himſelf with the King, who found him at once ſubmiſſive
and enterprizing. Wolſey ſung, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, danced, with every libertine of
the court; and his houſe was the ſcene of all the King's criminal
pleaſures and amours. To ſuch a weak and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Monarch as Henry,
qualities of this nature were highly pleaſing, and Wolſey was made his
Prime Miniſter, and managed the whole kingdom at his pleaſure. The people
ſaw, with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the new favourite's mean condeſcenſions to the
King, and his arrogance to themſelves. They had long regarded the vicious
inſolence and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſplendor of the clergy with envy and
deteſtation, and Wolſey's greatneſs ſerved to bring a new odium upon
that body, already too much the object of the people's diſlike.</p>
            <p>Wolſey had ſome talents as a miniſter, but his failings
outbalanced them, being exceſſively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful, ambitious, and intolerably
proud. Among other inſtances of his ambition, he aſpired at the Popedom.
Ferdinand, who was then Emperor of Germany, promiſed him his intereſt to
procure it, and this conſequently attached the Engliſh mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter more
cloſely to the Emperor: this Monarch was then at war with France, and each
power ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited the alliance of England. It was the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the
Engliſh calmly to look on as ſpectators of the quarrel, and ſuffer its
rivals in power to grow weak by their mutual animoſity: Wolſey, however,
preferring his own intereſt to that of his country or his maſter, engaged
in a league againſt France. Soon after, however, the Pope dying, and the
Emperor failing in his promiſe, Wolſey, <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0443100201:233"/> in revenge,
induced his maſter to change ſides, and aſſiſt France againſt
Ferdinand.</p>
            <p>A victory over the Scots, rather oſtentatious than uſeful,
ſerved, in ſome meaſure, to repreſs the diſcontents of the people
during this mal-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the eccleſiaſtical favourite: this
vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory was obtained by the Earl of Surrey over James IV. of Scotland; it was
fought at Flodden Field, and the Scots loſt, upon this occaſion, the flower
of their nobility and gentry, and James, their King, was ſlain in
batttle.</p>
            <p>Succeſs ever ſerves to ſtop the murmurings of the Engliſh,
and no nation can better endure to be ſplendidly miſerable. Wolſey now
became a Cardinal, grew every day more powerful, and more deſirous of power;
the Pope was ſenſible of his influence over the King, and therefore created
him his legate in England. The Pontiff's deſign was to make him thus
inſtrumental in draining the kingdom of money, upon pretence of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it
in a war againſt the Turks, but, in reality, to fill his own coffers. In this
he ſo well ſerved the court of Rome, that he, ſome time after, made him
legate for life: he was now, therefore, at once a Legate, a Cardinal, a
Biſhop, a Prime Miniſter, and poſſeſſed of numberleſs church
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices; yet, ſtill unſatisfied, he deſired greater promotions. He
therefore procured a bull from the Pope, impowering him to make Knights and
Counts, to legitimate baſtards, to give degrees in arts, law, phyſic, and
divinity, and grant all ſorts of diſpenſations. So much pride and power
could not avoid giving high offence to the nobility, yet none dared to vent
their indignation, ſo greatly were they in terror of his vindictive temper.
The Duke of Buckingham, ſon of him who loſt <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0443100201:234"/> his life
in the reign of Richard III, was the only perſon who had reſolution enough
to complain. His threats were ſoon conveyed to Wolſey by an informer, who
was not ſlow to accuſe the Duke of high treaſon. The ſubſtance of his
impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, that he had conſulted a fortune-teller concerning his
ſucceſſion to the crown, and had affected to make himſelf popular. This
was but a weak pretext to take away the life of a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe father had
died in defence of the late King: however, he was condemned to die as a
traitor. When the ſentence was pronouncing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and the High
Steward came to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the word traitor, the unhappy priſoner could no
longer contain: 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>My Lords,</hi> cried he to his Judges, <hi>I am
no traitor; and, for what you have now done againſt me, take my ſincere
forgiveneſs; as for my life, I think it not worth petitioning for; may God
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give you, and pity me.</hi>
               </q> He was ſoon after executed on
Tower-hill.</p>
            <p>Every juſt man muſt feel the higheſt indignation at ſo
unmerited a puniſhment. In the former reign, the few that periſhed under
the hand of the executioner were really culpable; but here we ſee a
nobleman's life taken away, only for his diſlike to an aſpiring and
licentious upſtart. It is this cruelty of puniſhing without guilt, and not
the number of executions in a reign, that diſtinguiſhes it into tyrannical
or merciful: perhaps there were more executions under Henry VII, than his
ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor; and yet the firſt was a juſt and merciful Prince, the
latter an arbitrary and mercileſs tyrant.</p>
            <p>By this time all the immenſe treaſures of the late King were
quite exhauſted on empty pageants, guilty pleaſures, or vain treaties and
expeditions. Wolſey was a proper inſtrument to ſupply the King 
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0443100201:235"/> with money, which now began to be wanted; this he
extorted by the name of a benevolence: Henry minded not by what methods it was
raiſed, provided he had but the enjoyment of it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his miniſter met
ſome oppoſition in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to levy thoſe involuntary contributions:
having exacted a conſiderable ſubſidy from the clergy, he next
addreſſed himſelf to the Houſe of Commons, but they only granted half
the ſupplies he demanded. The Cardinal was highly offended at their
parſimony, and deſired to be heard in the houſe; but, as this would have
deſtroyed the very form and conſtitution of that auguſt body, they
replied, that none could be admitted to reaſon there but ſuch as were
members. This was the firſt attempt made, in the preſent reign, to render
the King maſter of the debates in parliament; Wolſey firſt paved the way,
and, unfortunately for the kingdom, the King too well improved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his
deſign.</p>
            <p>Wolſey was, ſoon after, raiſed to ſtill greater dignities
than before: he was, at once, Archbiſhop of York, Biſhop of Durham, Abbot
of St. Alban's, a Cardinal, Legate for life, Lord Chancellor of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Prime
Miniſter, and favourite, and careſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or feared by all the powers of
Europe: he now, therefore, undertook more openly to render the King independent
of his parliament, and levied the ſubſidy granted by them for four years,
and conſequently to be paid at four different times, all at once. Againſt
this the poor, who were the greateſt ſufferers, moſt loudly exclaimed;
but he diſregarded their clamours, ſecure in the King's approbation and the
Pope's protection.</p>
            <p>Theſe proceedings only paved the way to ſtill greater
extortions: Wolſey was too haughty to <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0443100201:236"/> be refuſed in
his demands by the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and determined to levy money upon the
King's authority alone. This was deemed a breach of the Magna Charta, and the
people abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to comply, even a general rebellion threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to enſue: the King, finding what were likely to be the conſequences of the
Cardinal's precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate meaſures, pretended that they were carried on without
his authority; but, at the ſame time, demanded from the people a benevolence,
which was only an artifice to extort money, under a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent name. The people
ſeemed ſenſible of the King's art, and the citizens of London refuſed
to give the benevolence demanded: their example was followed by the country,
and an univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſeemed to prevail. The King, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of
bad conſequences, by perſiſting in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, thought proper to
retract, for this time, and wait a more favourable opportunity of
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
            <p>You now find the people labouring under a very different form of
oppreſſion from that in the reigns preceding Henry VII. In thoſe earlier
times their miſeries chiefly aroſe from the licentiouſneſs of the
nobility; in this reign they proceeded from the uſurpations of the King.
Before Henry VII. had balanced the government, the people often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
their taxes by an inſurrection; but now, that the preſent Henry had
deſtroyed that balance again, the people were obliged to pay taxes that were
not due. In ſhort, they now ſeemed as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable as when their great
reſtorer had brought them from anarchy: an arbitrary King, an ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricious
Pope, a revengeful favourite, a luxurious clergy, all conſpired to harraſs
them: yet, during this whole reign, there was no rebellion; not from 
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0443100201:237"/> the juſtice of the King's adminiſtration, nor from
the love the people had to their Sovereign; but, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily for the reigning
tyrant, he enjoyed the effects of his predeceſſor's prudence, not his
own.</p>

               </gap>r to have a pretext for amaſſing
ſuch ſums, he undertook to found two new colleges at Oxford, for which he
received every day freſh grants from the Pope and the King. To execute his
ſcheme he obtained a liberty of ſuppreſſing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral monaſteries,
and converting their funds to the benefit of his intended ſcheme. Whatever
might have been the Pope's inducement to grant him theſe privileges, nothing
could be more fatal to the Pontiff's intereſts; for Henry was thus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
taught to imitate afterwards what he had ſeen a ſubject perform without
crime or danger.</p>
            <p>Hitherto the adminiſtration of affairs was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by Wolſey
alone; as for the King, he loſt in the embraces of his miſtreſſes all
the complaints of the nation, and the Cardinal undertook to keep him ignorant,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rder to maintain his own
authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But now a period approached that was to put an end to this
miniſter's exorbitant power: one of the moſt extraordinary and important
revolutions that ever employed the attention of man, was now ripe for
execution. But, to have a clear idea of this <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0443100201:238"/> grand
reformation, it will be proper to take a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory view of the ſtate of the
church at that time, and obſerve by what ſeemingly contradictory means
Providence produces the happieſt events.</p>
            <p>The church of Rome had now, for more than a thouſand years, been
corrupting the ſacred doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Chriſtianity, and converting into a
tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porality the kingdom of another world. The Popes were frequently found at
the head of their own armies, fighting for their dominions with the arm of
fleſh, and forgetting, in cruelty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral politics, all the pretended
ſanctity of their character. They drained other kingdoms of their treaſures
upon the moſt infamous pretexts, and were proud of ſetting at Rome, in
their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, an example of refined pleaſure and ſtudied luxury. The
cardinals, prelates, and dignitaries of the church lived and were ſerved like
voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Princes, and ſome of them were found to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs eight or
nine biſhoprics at a time. Wherever the church governs, it exerts its power
with cruelty; and to their luxury theſe great ones added the crime of being
tyrants too.</p>
            <p>As for the inferior clergy, both Popiſh and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant writers
exclaim againſt their diſſolute and abandoned morals. They publicly kept
miſtreſſes, and bequeathed to their baſtards whatever they were able to
ſave from their pleaſures, or extort from the poor. There is ſtill to be
ſeen, ſays a fine writer, a will made by a Biſhop of Cambray, in which he
ſets aſide a certain ſum 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>for the baſtards he has had already, and
thoſe which, by the bleſſing of God, be may yet happen to have.</hi>
               </q>
In many parts of England and Germany the people obliged the prieſts to have
concubines, ſo that the laity might keep their wives in greater ſecurity;
while the <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0443100201:239"/> poor laborious peaſant and artizan ſaw all
the fruits of their toil go, not to clothe and maintain their own little
families, but to pamper men who inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſpiſed them.</p>
            <p>But the vices of the clergy were not greater than their ignorance;
few of them knew the meaning of their own Latin maſs; they were chiefly
employed in finding out witches, and exorciſing the poſſeſſed: but,
what moſt encreaſed the hatred of the people againſt them, was the
ſelling pardons and abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for ſin at certain ſtated prices. A
deacon, or ſubdeacon, who ſhould commit murder, was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved from his
crime, and allowed to poſſeſs three benefices, upon paying twenty crowns.
A Biſhop or an Abbot might commit murder for ten pounds. Every crime had its
ſtated price, and abſolutions were given, not only for ſins already
committed, but for ſuch as ſhould be committed hereafter. The wiſeſt of
the people looked with ſilent deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on theſe impoſitions, and
the ignorant, whom nature ſeemed to have formed for ſlavery, began to open
their eyes to ſuch glaring abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>There aroſe, at laſt, a champion to reſcue hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature from
its degeneracy. This was the famous Martin Luther. Leo X, being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in
building the church of St. Peter's at Rome, in the year 1519, in order to
procure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for carrying on this project, he gave a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for
ſelling indulgences, or, in other words, a deliverance from the pains of
purgatory, either for one's ſelf or their friends. There were every-where
ſhops opened, where theſe were ſold; but, in general, they were to be had
at taverns and ſuch-like places. Theſe indulgences were granted to the
Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minican friars to be diſtributed by them, whereas <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0443100201:240"/>
the Auguſtine friars had been in poſſeſſon of the diſtribution of
them time out of mind before. Martin Luther was an Auguſtine Monk, and one of
thoſe who reſented this transferring the ſale of indulgences to another
order. He began to ſhew his indignation, by preaching againſt their
efficacy: oppoſition ſoon drove him farther than he at firſt intended to
go, and, now the veil was lifted, he proceeded to examine the authority of the
Pope himſelf. The people, who had long groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Papal tyranny,
heard his diſcourſes with pleaſure, and defended him againſt the
authority and machinations of the church of Rome. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric, Elector of Saxony,
ſurnamed the Wiſe, openly protected him. Luther as openly declaimed
againſt the number of ſacraments, reducing the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven held by the church
of Rome, firſt to three, and afterwards to two: from thence he proceeded to
examine the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, to ſhew the folly of
ſuppoſing a purgatory, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence of celibacy among
the clergy.</p>
            <p>The Pope iſſued out his bulls againſt Luther, and the
Dominican friars procured his books to be burned. Luther abuſed the
Dominicans, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the ſtreets of Wirtemberg, burned the bull of the
Pope. In the mean time the diſpute was carried on by writings on either
ſide: Luther, though oppoſed by the Pope, the Cardinals, and all the body
of the clergy, ſupported his cauſe ſingly and with ſucceſs. If indeed
we look into his works at this day, we ſhall find them trifling and
unſatisfactory enough; but then he had only ignorance to contend with, and,
ill as he wrote, they anſwered ſtill worſe. Opinions are inculcated upon
the minds of the public; rather by fortitude and perſeverance than by
ſtrength of reaſoning or <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0443100201:241"/> beauty of thought, and no
man had more forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and more perſeverance than he.</p>
            <p>In this diſpute it was the fate of Henry VIII. to be one of the
champions. His father, who had given him the education of a ſcholar,
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to be inſtructed in ſchool divinity, which then compoſed
the learning of the times. He was, therefore, willing to give the world a
demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his abilities in this reſpect, and deſired the Pope's
permiſſion to read the works of Luther, which had been forbidden to be read
under pain of excommunication. Having readily obtained this requeſt, the
King, from St. Thomas Aquinas, defended the ſeven ſacraments, and ſhewed
ſome ſkill in ſchool divinity, tho' it is thought that Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey had the
chief hand in directing him. A book being thus finiſhed in haſte, it was
ſent to Rome for the Pope's approbation: the Pope, raviſhed with its
eloquence and depth, compared the work to that of St. Auguſtine or St.
Jerome, and gave Henry the title of <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> little
ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that Henry was ſoon going to be one of the moſt terrible
enemies that ever the church of Rome had yet experienced</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe cauſes which contributed to render the Romiſh
church odious or contemptible, there were ſtill others proceeding from
political motives. Clement V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

that the Pope might be injured with impunity; and the behaviour of the Pope
manifeſted but little of that ſanctity or infallibility to which the
Pontiffs pretended. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, as he had obliged the Pope, he ſuppoſed
that he might, upon any emergency, expect a return of favour.</p>
            <p>It was in this ſituation of the church and of the Pope, that a new
drama was going to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which was to change the whole ſyſtem of
Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. Henry had now been married eighteen years to Catharine of Arragon, who
had been brought over from Spain to marry his elder brother, Prince Arthur, who
died ſome months after his co-habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with her: Henry had three children
by this lady, one of whom was ſtill living, while ſhe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was
eſteemed for her virtue and the gentleneſs of her diſpoſition. The
King, tho' he felt no real paſſion, either for the qualifications of her
mind or perſon, yet for a long time broke out into no fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant contempt; he
ranged from beauty to beauty in the court, and his title and authority always
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him a ready compliance from female frailty. It happened, at length,
that among the maids of honour that then attended the Queen, was one Anna
Bullen, the daughter of a gentleman of diſtinction, tho' not of the nobility.
Her beauty ſurpaſſed what had hitherto appeared at this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
court; her features were regular, mild, and attractive; her ſtature elegant,
though below the middle ſize; while her wit and vivacity even exceeded the
allurements of her perſon. The King, who never reſtrained one paſſion
which he <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0443100201:243"/> deſired to gratify, ſaw, and loved her;
but, after ſeveral efforts to induce her to comply with his criminal
paſſion, he found that without marriage he could have no hopes of
ſucceeding. This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle, therefore, he quickly undertook to remove; his
own Queen was now become hateful to him, and, in order to procure a divorce, he
pretended that his conſcience rebuked him, for having ſo long lived in
inceſt with his preſent Queen, formerly his brother's wife. This every
perſon of candour ſaw was only a pretext to cover his real motive; he
himſelf had eagerly ſolicited the match with Queen Catharine; he had lived
with her eighteen years without any ſcruple, and had the Pope's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence for
this cohabitation; but he aſſerted, that a wounded conſcience was his
motive, and none of his ſubjects offered to divulge the real one.</p>
            <p>In this perplexity, therefore, he applied to Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment VII, who owed
him obligations, and from whom he expected a ready compliance, to diſſolve
the bull of the former Pope, who had given him permiſſion to marry
Catharine, and to declare that it was contrary to all laws, both divine and
human. Clement was now in the utmoſt perplexity, Queen Catharine was aunt to
the Emperor who had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made him a priſoner, and whoſe reſentment he
dreaded to rekindle, by thus injuring ſo near a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; beſide, he could
not, in honour, declare the bull of a former Pope illicit, for this would be
entirely deſtroying papal infallibility. On the other hand, Henry was his
protector and friend; the dominions of England were the chief reſource of his
finances, and the King of France, ſome time before, had got a bull of divorce
in ſomewhat ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar circumſtances. In this exigence he thought the
beſt method was to ſpin out the affair by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation; 
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0443100201:244"/> and thus he argued, temporized, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, recanted,
and diſputed, hoping that the King's paſſion would never hold out during
the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious courſe of an eccleſiaſtical controverſy. In this he was
miſtaken; Henry had been taught to argue as well as he, and quickly found, or
wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, many texts of ſcripture to favour his opinions and his
paſſion. To his arguments he added threats, which probably had greater
influence: the Pope was aſſured that the Engliſh were already but too
much diſpoſed to withdraw their obedience from the Holy See, and that, if
he continued to refuſe, the whole country would readily follow their
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch's example, and exclude themſelves from his protection. The King even
propoſed to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, whether, if he was denied the putting away his
preſent Queen, he might not have a diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to marry two wives at a
time? The Pope, though his meaſures were already taken not to grant the bull,
yet ſtill ſeemed unreſolved, as if waiting for more full and authentic
information.</p>
            <p>During theſe ſolicitations, on which Henry's happineſs
ſeemed to depend, he expected, in his favourite Wolſey, a warm defender and
a ſteady adherent; but, in this, he was deceived. Wolſey ſeemed to be in
pretty much ſuch a dilemma as the Pope himſelf. On the one hand he was to
pleaſe his maſter the King, from whom he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a thouſand marks
of favour: on the other hand he could not diſoblige the Pope, whoſe
ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant he more immediately was, and who had power to puniſh his
diſobedience: in this dilemma he choſe to ſtand neuter; though, of all
mankind, he was moſt haughty, on this occaſion he gave way in all things,
to his colleague Cardinal Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pegio, ſent by the Pope from Italy. Wolſey's 
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0443100201:245"/> method of temporizing highly diſguſted the King, yet
he endeavoured to conceal his reſentment: he now only looked out for ſome
man of equal abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and leſs art, and it was not long till accident threw
in his way one Thomas Cranmer, of greater abilities than the former, and rather
more integrity. Cranmer was a Doctor of Divinity and a Profeſſor at
Cambridge, but had loſt his place upon mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying contrary to the inſtitutes
of the canon law, which enjoined him celibacy. He had travelled into Germany,
where he read Luther's works, and embraced his doctrine; and, upon his return,
was tutor to the ſons of a gentleman, who one night happened to entertain two
of the principal men of the court: Cranmer, being aſked his opinion of the
King's divorce, which was then the topic of the converſation, delivered
himſelf in ſo learned a manner, that the King was ſoon informed of his
abilities, and ordered him to follow the court.</p>
            <p>The King's reſentment now appeared more openly againſt the
Cardinal. The Attorney-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was ordered to prepare a bill of indictment
againſt him, and ſoon after he himſelf was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to reſign the
great ſeal. Crimes are readily found againſt a man when he is hated, and
the Cardinal was ſentenced to be excluded from the protection of the laws. As
ſoon as he was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed, the King commanded him to retire to a
country-houſe, and directed that an inventory of his goods ſhould be taken,
which contained im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe riches, acquired by various methods of guilt and
extortion: of fine holland alone there were found in his houſe a thouſand
pieces, which may ſerve to give an idea of the reſt of his wealth. The
parliament confirmed the ſentence of the courts, and he was ſent an exile
to his country <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0443100201:246"/> ſeat, there to await the King's
diſpoſal of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with all the fluctuations of hope and
appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion. Still, however, he was left the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhopric of York, and,
even ſhattered as his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes were, he was reſolved to perform the
cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his inſtalment there with a magnificence little ſuitable to
his preſent condition: but, while he was preparing to enjoy, in this retreat,
thoſe ſplendors which he ever loved, by another unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected revolution, he
was at the King's command arreſted by the Earl of Northumberland for high
treaſon. He at firſt refuſed to comply, as being a Cardinal; but, finding
the Earl bent upon perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his commiſſion, he complied, and ſet out,
by eaſy journies, for London, to appear as a criminal in a place where he
formerly acted as a King. In his way he ſtayed a fortnight at the Earl of
Shrewſbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's, where one day at dinner he was taken ill, not without violent
ſuſpicions of having poiſoned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: being brought forward from
thence, with much difficulty he reached Leiceſter abbey, where, the Monks
coming out to receive him, he ſaid, Father Abbot, I am come to lay my bones
among you: as his diſorder increaſed, an officer being placed near his
bed-ſide at once to guard and attend him, he cried out to him, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>O, if I had ſerved my God as I have ſerved
my King, he would not thus have forſaken me in adverſity.</hi>
               </q> He died
ſoon after, in all the pangs of repentance and remorſe, and left a life
which he had all along rendered turbid by ambition, till he found that all his
ambition was but vanity at the laſt. He left two natural children behind him,
one of whom being a prieſt, was loaded with church preferments. Henry, being
thus freed from a perſon whom he conſidered as an obſtacle to his
intentions, by the advice of Cranmer had the legality of his preſent 
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0443100201:247"/> marriage canvaſſed in the different univerſities
of Europe. It was very extraordinary to ſee the King on one ſide
ſoliciting the univerſities to be favourable to his paſſion, and on the
other the Emperor preſſing them to incline to his aunt: Henry liberally
rewarded thoſe Doctors who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in his favour, and the Emperor granted
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices to ſuch as voted on his ſide of the debate. Time has
diſcovered theſe intrigues; in one of Henry's account-books we find the
diſburſements he made upon theſe occaſions; to a deacon he gave a
crown, to a ſubdeacon two crowns, and ſo of the reſt, to each in
proportion to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. The perſon who bribed on theſe
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, however, excuſed himſelf by declaring, that he never paid the
money till after the vote was given. Henry at length prevailed; his
li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralities were greater than thoſe of his rival, as he was moſt
intereſted in the ſucceſs of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: all the colleges of Italy and
France una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly declared his preſent marriage againſt all law, divine
and human, and that therefore it was not at firſt in the power of the Pope to
grant a diſpenſation. The only places where it was moſt warmly oppoſed,
were at Cambridge and Oxford; theſe univerſities, it ſeems, had, even
then, more freedom and integrity than were to be found elſe-where, but at
laſt they alſo concurred in the ſame opinion.</p>
            <p>The agents of Henry were not content with the ſuffrages of the
univerſities; the opinions of the Rabbi's were alſo demanded; but they were
eaſily bought up in his favour. Thus fortified, the King was reſolved to
oppoſe even the Pope himſelf, for his paſſion by no means could brook
the delays and ſubterfuges of the Holy See: being, <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0443100201:248"/>
therefore, ſupported by his clergy, and authoriſed by the univerſities;
having ſeen the Pope former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly degraded by a lay Monarch, and Luther's
doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine followed by thouſands; and yet, ſtill further inſtigated by the
King of France, he, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpenſation, annulled his marriage
with Queen Catharine, and Cranmer, now become an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, pronounced the
decree.</p>
            <p>The Queen, during this conteſt, always ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported her rights
with reſolution, and yet with modeſty: at length, however, having found the
inutility of further reſiſtance, ſhe retired to the country, without once
offering to complain: ſhe ſaw the power of her rival, and yielded without
murmuring. Anna Bullen had already conſented to marry the King, and even
ſhared his bed two months before his marriage with Catharine was
diſſolved. Though her prudence and her virtue demanded eſteem in the
former parts of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, yet ſhe now for a moment forgot the ties of
each, and gave a looſe to her triumph. She paſſed through London with a
magnificence greater than had ever been known before; the ſtreets were
ſtrewed, the walls were hung, the conduits ran with wine, while ſhe and her
corpulent lover rode through the city like the heroine and knight of a
romance.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Pope now thought himſelf obliged to hold no
meaſures with the King; and, being alſo frighted by the menaces of the
Emperor, publiſhed a ſentence, declaring Queen Catharine alone to be
Henry's lawful wife, and requiring him to take her again, with a denunciation
of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in caſe of a refuſal. When Henry received news of the
ſentence given againſt him at Rome, he was convinced that no meaſures
could be kept <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0443100201:249"/> with the Holy See, and therefore no longer
delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to execute his long meditated ſcheme of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating entirely from
the church of Rome. The parliament was at his devotion; a part of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
was for him, as they had already declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope, when they
decreed in favour of the divorce; the people were flattered with the
expectation of being rid of the burden of their taxes; and ſuch as were
diſpleaſed to ſee Italian Biſhops hold Engliſh church preferments,
expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their downfall: in ſhort, all things conſpired to co-operate with
his deſigns; he, therefore, at once ordered himſelf to be declared, by his
clergy, head of the church. The parliament confirmed his title, and aboliſhed
all the authority of the Pope in England, the tribute of Peter-pence, and the
collation to eccleſiaſtical benefices. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came into the King's
project with joy, and took an oath, called the oath of ſupremacy; all the
credit of the Pope, that had ſubſiſted for ages, was now at once
overthrown, and few, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe who held to the religious houſes,
ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſſatisfied. They who believed that it would have been dangerous
to break with the Pope, were now convinced that it could be effected with
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity; and it was ſoon perceived, that all autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which is not
ſupported by power, is nothing but an empty name.</p>

            <p>IN this manner began the reformation in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and by ſuch
ſurpriſing methods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence brought about its deſigns, as if to mock
hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſagacity. Let us now purſue its progreſs, and follow this
capricious Monarch through his various projects, cruelties, and
inconſiſtencies. The parliament were now entirely dependant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King;
they had, from the beginning, ſided with him in his ſeparating from the
church of Rome, and conſequently were now obliged to comply with all his
other meaſures, in order to ſtrengthen the new reformation.</p>
            <p>Henry was very ſenſible that the parliament was now, even from
motives of intereſt, entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoted to him, and therefore he was
reſolved to make uſe of the opportunity, and render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf abſolute.
He therefore oppoſed the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the monks, and availed
himſelf of the hatred which that body incurred by their ſuppreſſion:
the parliament at firſt began by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the abuſes practiſed in
monaſteries, and, finding ſome, condemned all: but, while they were
employed in ſuppreſſing them, Henry was buſy in deſtroying the power
of the ſuppreſſors. This was the origin of the unlimitted power he now
aſſumed; his parliament, at different times, paſſed every ſtatute he
thought proper to propoſe, how abſurd ſoever; and many of them were, in
fact, marked with the higheſt abſurdities. They teſtified their
ſatisfaction, not only for what he had done, but alſo for whatever he
intended to do. They enacted, that the ſame obedience ſhould be paid to the
King's proclamation as to an act of <pb n="248" facs="tcp:0443100201:251"/> parliament, which
was deſtroying all their power at one blow; they declared their readineſs
to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, not only what had been directed, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the King ſhould
direct, in matters of religion, for the future: but, to crown all, they enacted
that the King ſhould not pay his debts, and that ſuch as had been paid by
him, ſhould refund the money.</p>
            <p>Being thus impowered to act as he thought proper, he went
vigorouſly to work in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of monaſteries, colleges, and
religious houſes. Cambridge and Oxford, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their
antiquity, ſhared the ſame fate with the reſt, and the lectures were, for
a time, diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and the revenues confiſcated. To recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the
people to theſe proceedings, Henry took care to have the counterſeit
reliques expoſed, the ſcandalous lives of the friars and nuns made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic,
and all their debaucheries detected. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had ſerved to engage the
people in ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was publicly burnt; but what grieved the people
moſt to ſee, were, the bones of Thomas Becket, the ſaint of Canterbury,
treated with the ſame ſeverity, burnt in public, and his rich ſhrine, in
which there was a diamond of great value, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated among the common
plunder. The people looked on with ſilent horror, afraid to rebel, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deteſting the vices of the monks and the impiety of the King.</p>
            <p>But, while the King had entirely ſeparated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from Rome,
yet he was by no means willing to be a follower of Luther. The invocation of
ſaints was not yet aboliſhed by him, but only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained: he ordered the
Bible to be tranſlated into the vulgar tongue, but not put into the hands of
the laity. It was a capital crime to believe in the <pb n="249" facs="tcp:0443100201:252"/>
Pope's ſupremacy, and yet equally heinous to be of the reformed religion, as
practiſed in Germany. His opinions upon religion were delivered in a law,
which, from its horrid conſequences, was termed <hi>the Bloody Statute;</hi>
by which it was ordained, that whoever, by word or writing, denied
tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, that whoever maintained the communion in both kinds
was neceſſary, or that it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for prieſts to marry, or that vows
of chaſtity could innocently be broken, or that private maſſes were
unprofitable, or that auricular confeſſion was unneceſſary, ſhould be
burnt or hanged as the court ſhould determine.</p>
            <p>The kingdom, at that time, was in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure divided between
the followers of Luther and the adherents to the Pope; this ſtatute, with his
former decrees, in ſome meaſure excluded both, and therefore opened a wide
field for perſecution.</p>
            <p>Theſe perſecutions, however, were preceded by one of a different
nature, ariſing neither from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious nor political cauſes, but
tyrannical caprice. Anna Bullen, his Queen, was herſelf of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran
perſuaſion, and had ſecretly favoured that party: theſe attachments
ſoon created her enemies, who only waited ſome favourable occaſion to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory her credit with the King, and that occaſion preſented itſelf
but too ſoon. The King's paſſion was, by this time, quite exhauſted;
the only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he ever had for her was that brutal appetite which enjoyment
ſoon deſtroys; he was fallen in love, once more, if we may call it love,
with Jane Seymour, a maid of honour to the Queen.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Queen's enemies perceived the King's diſguſt,
they ſoon gave him an opportunity to gratify his inclinations, by accuſing
her of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry intrigues with her domeſtics; which accuſation 
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0443100201:253"/> was eagerly caught up by the King. All his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
were in extreme; he immediately flew to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and had her accuſed of
adultery and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt with her own brother. This parliament, who had long
ſhewn themſelves the timid miniſters of all his paſſions, condemned
the Queen and her brother, without ever knowing on what foundation the
ſentence was grounded.</p>
            <p>Her brother, Lord Rochfort, was beheaded, though there was not the
leaſt proof of his guilt: one Norris and Brereton were hanged for only having
paid her ſuch compliments, as would now merdy paſs for gallantry and
innocent amuſement: Smeton, a muſician, was compelled to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his
having received favours from her, and he was then hanged without an opportunity
of being confronted by the Queen.</p>
            <p>Upon ſuch ſlight ſuſpicions was this unhappy Queen ſent to
the Tower, in order to await the execution of her ſentence. She who had been
once the envied object of royal favour, was now going to give a new inſtance
of the capriciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of fortune: ſhe was ever of a chearful
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and her eaſy levities perhaps diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the gloomy
tyrant. She had diſtributed, in the laſt year of her life, not leſs than
fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds among the poor, and was at once their protector and
darling. Upon being conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her priſon, ſhe ſat down to addreſs
the King, by letter, for mercy: in this ſhe inſiſted upon her innocence
in the ſtrongeſt terms: 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>You have raiſed me,</hi> ſaid ſhe,
<hi>from privacy to make me a lady; from a lady you made me a Counteſs, from
a Counteſs a Queen, and from a Queen I ſhall ſhortly become a
ſaint.</hi>
               </q> On the morning of her execution ſhe ſent for Mr.
Kingſton, the keeper of the Tower, to whom, <pb n="251" facs="tcp:0443100201:254"/> upon
entering her priſon, ſhe ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Mr. Kingſton, I hear I am not to die till
noon, and I am ſorry for it, for I thought to be dead before this time, and
free from a life of pain.</hi>
               </q> The keeper attempting to comfort her by
aſſuring her the pain would be very little, ſhe replied, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>I have heard the executioner is very
expert;</hi> and, claſping her neck with her hands, laughing, <hi>and I have
but a little neck.</hi>
               </q> Kingſton, who gives this account, continues to
obſerve, that he had ſeen many men and women executed, but never one
whoſe fortitude was equal to her's. She was beheaded ſoon after, behaving
with the utmoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and reſolution.</p>
            <p>Anna Bullen ſeemed to be guilty of no other crime than that of
having ſurvived the King's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: many crowned heads had already been
put to death in England, but this was the firſt royal execution upon a
ſcaffold. Henry ordered his parliament to give him a divorce, between her
ſentence and execution, thus to baſtardize Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, the only child he
had by her, as he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready baſtardized Mary, his only child by Queen
Catharine.</p>
            <p>The very next day after her execution he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Jane Seymour, who
died the year following, after having been delivered of a ſon.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the fires of Smithfield be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to blaze: thoſe
who adhered to the Pope, or they who followed Luther, were equally the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of royal vengeance and eccleſiaſtical perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. Thomas Cromwell,
raiſed by the King's caprice from a blackſmith's ſon to be a royal
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite (for tyrants ever raiſe their favourites from the loweſt of the
people) and Cranmer, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Archbiſhop of Cauterbury, with all their
might, aſſiſted the reformation. Biſhop Gardiner <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0443100201:255"/>
and the Duke of Norfolk, on the other hand, were for leading the King back to
his former ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, with every art; and Cromwell fell a ſacrifice
to their intrigues, but the Duke and Biſhop did not ſucceed. Unhappily for
his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the King became an equal perſecutor of the two religions
propoſed for his acceptance.</p>
            <p>It was now that England ſaw a ſpectacle to ſtrike the
boldeſt with horror; a company of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple condemned and executed all
together, ſome for being ſtedfaſt to the Pope, and others for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to Luther: among this number were Dr. Robert Barnes, Thomas Gerard, and William
Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, for being Lutherans; Buttolph, Danepliſs, Philpot, and Brinholm, for
continuing to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Pope. Theſe were all burnt together, without
ever being permitted to plead their own cauſe, or even to know their crimes
or their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers. The people in the North, indeed, during theſe times of
cruelty, ventured to riſe in rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, but by the means of the Duke of
Norfolk they were ſoon brought to a ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>During theſe tranſactions Henry contracted a new marriage with
Anne of Cleves, being induced by her picture, in which it ſeems the painter
had flattered her. He found her very different from what his paſſion had
expected, but married her from political motives. He could not, however, long
bear the uneaſineſs of being married for life to a woman, whoſe
corpulence, it ſeems, gave him diſguſt: he therefore reſolved to have
once more a divorce from his parliament, which he found it no difficult matter
to obtain. Among other reaſons to cancel his eſpouſals, he declared, that
he had not given an inward conſent to the marriage, without which it was
affirmed that his <pb n="253" facs="tcp:0443100201:256"/> promiſes could not be obligatory: he
added, that, as he was reſolved not to conſummate the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and to
have legitimate iſſue, ſo it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to give him a Queen by whom he
might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh theſe intentions. Theſe reaſons were thought good;
virtue and juſtice had been long baniſhed from the ſervile
parliament.</p>
            <p>He took, for a fifth wife, Catharine Howard, the Duke of Norfolk's
niece: in this match he ſeemed to be perfectly happy, and even ordered his
confeſſor to draw up a particular form of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, for the
bleſſings he enjoyed in a faithful wife. The Queen, it ſeems, pretended
to the ſame affection for him: but, alas, his amiable days were long over! he
was now almoſt choaked with fat, and had contracted a moroſe air, very
improper for inſpiring affection: the Queen had actually committed thoſe
lewdneſſes before marriage, of which Anna Bullen had formerly been falſly
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed. But thoſe crimes did by no means deſerve death, nor even a
divorce; ſince her fidelity to him, ſince marriage, was all that the moſt
ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous delicacy could require: Henry, however, conſidered her former
inconſtancy as a capital of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and, not yet ſatiated with blood, this
Queen was executed on Tower-hill. All this was terrible, but ſtill the King
was reſolved to be peculiarly cruel: though branded with three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorces, and
ſtained with the blood of two wives, he ordered a law to be enacted, equally
remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for its abſurdity and impoſſibility, namely, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>That, whatever perſon knew of the intrigues of
a Queen, he ſhould reveal it upon pain of high treaſon; or if any woman,
not a virgin, ſhould preſume to marry the King of England, ſhe ſhould
be guilty of high treaſon!</hi>
               </q> One would think that it were
impoſſible to procure a <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0443100201:257"/> body of men capable of
giving ſanction to ſuch inſcrutable abſurdities, and yet lay claim to
reaſon. It was pleaſantly ſaid (for even thoſe times of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
could not ſuppreſs ridicule) that the King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſtatute,
could only marry a widow. His next and laſt wife actually was a widow,
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine Parr, widow of Lord Latimer; and ſhe was a favourer of the
reformation.</p>
            <p>She was, however, to proceed with great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the King prided
himſelf much on his ſkill in theology, and it might be fatal to diſpute
with him upon religion, as ſhe had ſeen in the caſe of one Lambert,
ſome time before. It ſeems this man had denied tranſubſtantiation,
which Henry had ordered to be believed: the King, hearing that he was to be
tried at Weſtminſter for this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, which was capital, undertook,
himſelf, to diſpute the point with him in public. Letters were written to
many of the Biſhops and Nobility to be preſent upon this extraordinary
occaſion; and, on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0443100201:258"/> their halberds, puſhed it into the flames, where it
was ſoon conſumed to aſhes.</p>
            <p>It was not without reaſon, therefore, that the preſent Queen
concealed her ſentiments, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with caution; upon this account ſhe
durſt not intercede for three Proteſtants, who were burnt at Windſor
juſt after her marriage: ſhe once, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, attempted to argue with the
King, but it had like to have coſt her her life; wherefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhe
ſuffered the divines on each ſide to diſpute, and the executioner to
deſtroy. During theſe tranſactions the King would frequently
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the houſes of parliament, and harangue them with florid
orations, in which he would aver, that never Prince had a greater affection for
his people, or was more beloved by them. In every pauſe of his diſcourſe,
ſome of his creatures, near his perſon, would begin to applaud, and this
was followed by loud acclamations from the reſt of the audience.</p>
            <p>It is, indeed, aſtoniſhing, to what a pitch of cruelty he
attained, and to what a ſtate of ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity his people: I can account for
either in no other manner, than that religious diſputes had now ſo divided
the people, and ſet one againſt the other, that the King, availing
himſelf of the univerſal weakneſs which was produced by univerſal
diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, became the tyrant of all.</p>
            <p>But nature, at laſt, ſeemed kindly willing to rid the world of a
monſter that man was unable to deſtroy: Henry had been troubled, for ſome
time, with a diſorder in his leg, which was now grown very painful; this,
added to his monſtrous corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, which rendered him unable to ſtir, made
him more furious than a chained lion: he became froward and untractable, none
dared to approach <pb n="256" facs="tcp:0443100201:259"/> him without trembling. He had been
ever ſtern and ſevere, he was now outrageous: flattery had corrupted all
his ſenſes; he deemed it an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable crime to controvert thoſe
opinions which he himſelf was changing every hour. His courtiers, contending
among themſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring the death of each other, had no
inclination to make an enemy of him. Thus he continued, for four years, the
terror of all and the tormentor of himſelf: at length his end approached; he
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived he had not long to live, his fat increaſing and his leg growing
worſe. He had already ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſeveral favourites, raiſed from
obſcure ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſhare his dignities and his cruelty; More, Fiſher,
Cromwell, and others, died upon the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and Wolſey prevented it by
his own death: he was reſolved to make one victim more before he left the
world, and that was the Duke of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, who had formerly ſuppreſſed a
rebellion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited againſt him, and who had, all along, been the vigilant
miniſter of his commands. This no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman had, outwardly, complied with the
refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but, in his heart, favoured the Pope: the King knew this, and
only wanted a pretext to put him and his ſon, the Earl of Surry, to death: it
was no difficult matter to find one; the ſon had uſed the arms of Edward
the Confeſſor in his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutcheon, and the father had left a blank ſpace
in his own where they might be inſerted. This was all the crime alledged
againſt them, but it was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient when the King gave his opinion that it
was his will they ſhould die. The Earl of Surry was beheaded upon Tower-hill,
and a warrant ſent to the Lieutenant of the Tower to cut off the Duke of
Norfolk's head in two days following: this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was juſt upon the
point of being executed, <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0443100201:260"/> when the King's own death gave
him an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected reprieve. Henry had been ſuffered to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh without
any of his domeſtics having the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to warn him of his approaching end;
they who had ever come near him with trembling, now dreaded to give him this
friendly admonition. At length Sir Anthony Denny had the charity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him
of his ſituation: he thanked this cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier for his friendly admonition, and
ſoon after expired, full of ſorrow for his former guilt, and with all the
horrors of approaching diſſolution.</p>
            <p>Some Sovereigns have been tyrants from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction and revolt;
ſome from being miſled by favourites, and ſome from a ſpirit of party;
but Henry was cruel from diſpoſition alone, cruel in the government, cruel
in religion, and cruel in his family: yet, tyrant as he was, he died peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
a natural death, while Henry VI, the moſt harmleſs of all Monarchs, was
dethroned, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, and aſſaſſinated. It is a folly and a
wickedneſs to ſay, that good or bad actions are their own recompence here:
true is the doctrine of holy writ, The wicked have their good things in this
life, the virtuous muſt look for them in another.</p>
            <p>Our divines have taken much pains to vindicate the character of this
vicious Prince, as if his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and our reformation were, in fact, united:
nothing can be more abſurd than this, as if the moſt noble deſigns were
not often brought about by the moſt vicious inſtruments; we ſee even the
cruelty and injuſtice of man employed in our holy redemption.</p>

            <head>LETTER XXXII.</head>
            <p>THE alterations, in the reign of Henry, were rather ſeparations
from the Pope than a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of religious abuſes: in the reign of his
ſucceſſor Edward VI, his ſon by Jane Seymour, and heir to the crown,
the errors of Rome, in reality, began to be reformed. This Prince was but nine
years old when he aſcended the throne of his father, and the hiſtory of his
government is rather a detail of the methods purſued by his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors to
reform the abuſes of religion, than a ſeries of politics or war; and their
characters, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than his, ſhould be the object of the hiſtorian's
reſearch.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Somerſet was made Protector of the minority, and thus
engroſſed the whole admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration; the reſt of the council, which
were joined with him, either ſided with his views, or ineffectually oppoſed
them. To ſtrengthen his power, he marched againſt the Scots who had
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded England, their conſtant practice whenever they ſaw the country
employed in faction and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute: a ſlight victory, gained by him upon this
occaſion, acquired him popularity and power. I have more than once remarked,
that, to gain the hearts of the Engliſh, it was requiſite to be a
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. But to this character Somerſet added vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of a much more
amiable kind: he was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, civil, affable, courteous to the meaneſt
ſuitor, and all the actions of his life were directed by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of religion
and honour: he, at the ſame time, had learned to look with contempt and
deteſtation on the errors and corruptions of the church of Rome, and was
conſequently the warm friend of Archbiſhop Cranmer, who now undertook to
make <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0443100201:262"/> a real reformation, which Henry VIII. only
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to do.</p>
            <p>You have ſeen, in Henry's reign, that the only alterations he made
in religion, were ſuch as either favoured his paſſions or increaſed his
power. Thus all his ſubjects were under a peculiar reſtraint, which, upon
his death, was no longer continued: each took the liberty of ſpeaking his
thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on religion, though the laws of the laſt reign were ſtill in
force. In this diviſion of opinions, as it may eaſily be ſuppoſed, the
Reformers prevailed, for they had the Protector of their party: to that and,
therefore, they procured a general viſitation of churches, and reformed
numberleſs abuſes that were almoſt held ſacred by preſcription. It
was left to people's choice to go to confeſſion, which had been hitherto
deemed an indiſpenſable duty, or to neglect that practice. It was ordered,
that all images ſhould be taken out of churches, prieſts were allowed to
marry, the old maſs was aboliſhed, and a new liturgy drawn up, which
retrenched ſeveral abuſes in the ſervice of the church, and which is the
ſame with that now uſed, bating a few alterations.</p>
            <p>Theſe reformations were evidently calculated for the benefit of
the ſubject; but ſtill the Popiſh clergy, who either were expelled their
monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or had refuſed to conform, ſtirred up the people to riſe
in rebellion againſt them: we may judge, from the number of places in which
inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections were made, that thoſe reformations were by no means received
with univerſal ſatisfaction. There were, at once, inſurrections in
Wiltſhire, Suſſex, Hampſhire, Kent, Glouceſterſhire, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,
Warwickſhire, Eſſex, Hertfordſhire, Leiceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſhire,
Rutlandſhire, and Worceſterſhire; and the flames of war were rekindling
through the <pb n="260" facs="tcp:0443100201:263"/> whole kingdom. The Protector, who both by
principle and intereſt was a friend of the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, did every thing to
redreſs their grievances, and by that means ſtopped their fury for a while,
In fact, they had ſeveral complaints that were founded in juſtice: the
nobility had become poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of the forfeited lands which belonged
to the clergy, and, inſtead of leaving them to be culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by the poor, as
formerly, incloſed them for the purpoſes of pleaſure or magnificence.
This neceſſarily drove numbers, beſides the ejected friars, to the
utmoſt ſtreights; but, to add to their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, an act was
paſſed againſt them, the moſt ſevere that had hitherto been known in
England: it was enacted, that, if any perſon ſhould loiter, without
offering himſelf to work, for three days together, he ſhould be adjudged a
ſlave for two years to the firſt informer, and ſhould be marked on the
breaſt with the letter V, or <hi>vagabond,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed with an hot iron.
It is not to be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, therefore, that there ſhould be a general
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the people, when ſuffering ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
oppreſſions.</p>
            <p>But all the Protector's promiſes and endeavours could not
effectually redreſs their grievances, he therefore was obliged to have
recourſe to violence. Theſe were not the compact bodies of men that we have
ſeen in former rebellions, headed by ſome diſcontented or ambitious
courtier, and led on with conduct and ſucceſs: Henry VII. had effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
ſuppreſſed all ſuch; theſe were now only a tumultuous rabble; without
arms and without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, led on by ſome obſcure deſperado;
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable in their demands, and divided among each other; the unhappy
wretches were therefore eaſily overthrown. Above a thouſand of them 
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0443100201:264"/> were ſlain near Exeter by Lord Ruſſel, and two
thouſand more near Norwich by the Earl of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick.</p>
            <p>The kingdom was now again inclining to an ariſtocracy: the
nobility, by the late increaſe of their poſſeſſions, were grown
powerful, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the people at pleaſure. They now began to find
that they had a ſeparate intereſt from that of the commons, and conſpired
to carry on their power by union among themſelves, while the reſt of the
kingdom was divided. The Duke of Somerſet, however, oppoſed this project,
as he was ever a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of the people; and it was incumbent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to
deſtroy his power before they could eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their own. With this view
they placed the Earl of Warwick, afterwards made Duke of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, at
their head, and began by ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reports to deſtroy the Protector's
reputation; they next won over the common council of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to favour their
projects, and laſtly had him accuſed of high treaſon. The intereſt of
the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector was overpowered by that of his rival: he was condemned, and
loſt his head upon Tower-hill.</p>
            <p>In all this ſtruggle for power, the young King, by reaſon of his
age, was barely paſſive: he was only made the executor of the reſentment
and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the contending miniſters, as either hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to prevail;
and at one time ſigned the order for execution on this ſide, at another
time on that, but ever with tears in his eyes; a tenderneſs of
diſpoſition was one of this amiable youth's conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous qualities: to
theſe were added a ſagacity far ſurpaſſing his years and learning,
that amazed all ſuch as happened to converſe with him. When the dignity of
the throne was to be ſupported, he <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0443100201:265"/> behaved like a man;
and, at other times, was gentle and affable as became his age. In ſhort, he
had ſuch great qualities, or was ſaid to have ſuch, that mankind had
reaſon to lament his ſhort continuance among them. It is very probable,
however, that flattery would have contributed to deſtroy thoſe talents, as
it had thoſe of his father; for few Princes, except his father, had received
more flattery than he. He died of a defluxion upon his lungs, his death being
haſtened by medicines given by a woman who confidently pretended ſhe could
cure him. His death made way for another ſcene of horrid barbarity, in which
the kingdom was to be ruled by a weak and bigotted woman, who was herſelf
ruled by mercileſs prieſts, who received their orders from the court of
Rome.</p>

            <p>YOU have hitherto ſeen the ſucceſſion to the throne of
England, partly obtained by lineal deſcent, and partly by the aptitude for
govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the perſon choſen: neither wholly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary, nor quite
elective, it has ever made anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try the pretext of right, but, in fact, the
people ſued for the ſupport of theſe pretenſions. And this is the
beſt ſpecies of ſucceſſion that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: it prevents that
ariſtocracy, which is ever the reſult of a government entirely elective;
and that tyranny which is too often eſtabliſhed where there is never an
infringement upon hereditary claims.</p>
            <p>Whenever a Monarch of England happened to be arbitrary, he generally
conſidered the kingdom as his property, and not himſelf as a ſervant of 
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0443100201:266"/> the kingdom. In ſuch caſes it was natural for him,
at his deceaſe, to bequeath his dominions as he thought proper: Henry, in
conformity to this practice, made a will, in which he ſettled the
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion merely according to his uſual caprice; Edward VI. was
firſt nominated to ſucceed him, whoſe reign you have juſt ſeen; then
Mary, his eldeſt daughter by Catharine of Spain, but with a mark of ſpecial
condeſcenſion, by which he would intimate her illegitimacy; the next that
followed was Elizabeth, his daughter by Anna Bullen, with the ſame marks of
her not being legitimate: after his own children his ſiſter's children were
men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; his younger ſiſter the Ducheſs of Suffolk's iſſue were
preferred before his elder ſiſter the Queen of Scotland's, which preference
was thought by all to be neither founded in juſtice nor ſupported by
reaſon.</p>
            <p>Edward VI, as has been ſeen, ſucceeded him. He alſo made a
will, in which he gave the kingdom away from Mary and Elizabeth to the
Ducheſs of Suffolk's daughter, the lady Jane Grey, a girl of ſixteen. By
theſe diſpoſitions there were, after the death of young Edward, no leſs
than four Princeſſes who could lay claim to the crown: Mary, who was
firſt upon the will, had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared illegitimate by parliament, and that
act was never repealed; the ſame could be alledged againſt Elizabeth, but
ſhe had another foundation by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtored to her rights in her father's
reign; the Queen of Scotland, Henry's eldeſt ſiſter, could plead the
illegitimacy of his two daughters; and Jane Grey might alledge the will of the
laſt King in her favour.</p>
            <p>You have ſeen, in the laſt reign, the Earl of Warwick
ſuppreſſing an inſurrection of the people, afterwards becoming a
favourite of the King, then <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0443100201:267"/> made Duke of Northumberland,
next overturning the Duke of Somerſet his rival, and at length purſuing the
meaſures of the man whom he had deſtroyed. This nobleman's ambition did not
reſt here; he had hopes of ſecuring the crown in his own family, and, with
this view, he matched the lord Guilford Dudley, his ſon, with lady Jane Grey,
whom, by his intereſt, he hoped to ſettle on the throne. He was hated by
the people for his cruelties as much as the young lady was loved for her
virtues, and this was the greateſt obſtacle to his deſign. I have been
more prolix than uſual upon this topic of the ſucceſſion, but you
ſhould attend to it with care, in order to have a clear idea of the preſent
and the ſucceeding reigns.</p>
            <p>Immediately upon the death of the young King, but two competitors
put up for the crown. Mary, relying upon the juſtice of her preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
and Jane Grey, ſupported by the Duke of Northumberland, her father-in-law.
Mary was ſtrongly bigotted to the Popiſh ſuperſtitions, having been
bred up in reſtraint: ſhe was reſerved and gloomy; ſhe had, even during
the life of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the reſolution to maintain her ſentiments and
ceremonies, and refuſed to comply with his new inſtitutions: her zeal had
rendered her cruel, and ſhe was not only blindly attached to her reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
opinions, but even to the Popiſh clergy who maintained them. On the other
hand, Jane Grey was attached to the Reformers; though yet but ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, her
judgment had attained ſuch a degree of perfection as few enjoy in their more
advanced age. All hiſtorians agree, that the ſolidity of her
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, improved by continual application, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her the wonder
of her age. Aſcham, tutor to Elizabeth, informs us, that, coming once to 
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0443100201:268"/> wait upon her at her father's houſe in
Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, he found her reading Plato's works in Greek, when all the
reſt of the family were hunting in the park. He ſeemed ſurprized at her
being the only perſon abſent from the diverſions abroad, but ſhe
aſſured him, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>that Plato was an higher amuſement to her than
the moſt ſtudied refinements of ſenſual pleaſure.</hi>
               </q> It was
philoſophy, and not ambition, which ſhe ſeemed born for: when her
ambitious father-in-law came to inform her of her advancement to the throne,
ſhe heard the news with ſorrow, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the proffered honour with
reluctance. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the intreaties of her friends, and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of her
huſband, at length reconciled her to her fortune; ſhe was removed to the
Tower, and ſoon after proclaimed at London, while the people ſhewed few of
thoſe marks of ſatisfaction which uſually accompany a ceremony of this
kind.</p>
            <p>Jane was proclaimed by the council, but the people were for Mary.
The men of Suffolk roſe in her favour, Norfolk ſoon joined her, and Lord
Haſtings, with four thouſand men which were raiſed to oppoſe her,
revolted to her ſide. It was in vain that the Duke of Northumberland
attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lead his army againſt them; his ſoldiers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted on the
march, he found himſelf abandoned, and ſoon after the council itſelf,
which he once governed, now freed from reſtraint, declared againſt him.
Jane, who had but juſt been crowned, now ſaw herſelf again ſtripped of
her dignities, and, without any reluctance, laid down an honour which ſhe was
at firſt compelled to accept, and which ſhe held but nine days. Her father,
the Duke of Suffolk, delivered up the Tower, of which he had the command; and
her father-in-law, the Duke of Northumberland, being prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0443100201:269"/> from flying out of the kingdom, pretended to be
pleaſed at Mary's ſucceſs, and was the firſt to fling up his cap when
ſhe was proclaimed in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge.</p>
            <p>Mary now entered London, and, without the leaſt effuſion of
blood, ſaw herſelf joyfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, and peaceably ſettled on the
throne. This was a juncture that ſeemed favourable to Britiſh happineſs
and liberty; a Queen, whoſe rights were the moſt equitable, in ſome
meaſure elected by the people; the ariſtocracy of the laſt reign almoſt
wholly ſuppreſſed; the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, by this means, re-inſtated
in their former authority; the pride of the clergy humbled, and their vices
detected; together with peace abroad and almoſt unanimity at home. This was
the flattering proſpect upon Mary's acceſſion, but ſoon this pleaſing
phantom was diſſolved; Mary was cruel and a bigot; ſhe gave back their
former power to her clergy, and the kingdom was, once more, involved in the
horrors from whence it had lately been extricated.</p>
            <p>The Queen had promiſed to the men of Suffolk, who firſt declared
in her favour, that ſhe would ſuffer religion to remain in the ſituation
in which ſhe found it. This promiſe, however, ſhe by no means intended to
perform: political cruelty ever precedes religious: ſhe had reſolved on a
change of religion; but, before ſhe perſecuted heretics, who were as yet
her friends, it was neceſſary to get rid of ſome of the late council, who
were, in reality, her enemies. The Duke of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was the firſt
object of royal vengeance, and not indeed without reaſon. It is inſtructive
enough to obſerve the viciſſitudes of fortune; the Duke of Norfolk was
now taken from his priſon in the <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0443100201:270"/> Tower, to ſit as
judge upon the Duke of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, who had kept him there. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
made a very ſkilful defence, but what could that avail in a court
predetermined to condemn him? He was capitally convicted and ſoon after
executed, Sir John Gates, and Sir Thomas Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who had aſſiſted in his
projects, ſharing in his puniſhment.</p>
            <p>While theſe were falling as victims to their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, the
Queen's miniſters were, in the mean time, carrying on a negotiation of
marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and Philip, King of Spain. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thought they ſaw
that this would be a fatal blow to their liberties, and therefore loudly
mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured againſt it; but, when they found the treaty actually concluded,
they could no longer contain. Sir Thomas Wyat, a Roman Catholic, at the head of
four thouſand inſurgents, marched from Kent to Hyde-Park, and entered the
city in hopes of ſecuring the Tower: but his raſhneſs undid him; as he
paſſed through the narrow ſtreets, care was taken, by the Earl of
Pembroke, to block up the way behind him, by fortifications thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs
the ſtreets; and guards were placed at all the avenues to prevent his return.
This unhappy man paſſed boldly forward, and was now ready to reap the
fruits of his undertaking, when, to his aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he found that he
could neither proceed nor yet make good a retreat. He now, too late, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his own temerity, and, loſing all courage in the exigency, he ſurrendered
at diſcretion. In the mean time the Duke of Suffolk had endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to
foment the inſurrection, but without ſucceſs; he was taken priſoner
alſo, and deſtined for the common ſlaughter. Accordingly, Wyat, the Duke
of Suffolk, Sir John Throgmorton, and fifty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eight <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0443100201:271"/> more,
were executed; but what raiſed the compaſſion of the people moſt of
all, was the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Lady Jane Grey and her huſband Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Dudley,
who were involved in this calamity.</p>
            <p>Two days after Wyat was taken, Lady Jane and her huſband were
ordered to prepare for death: Lady Jane, who had long before ſeen the
threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened blow, was no way ſurprized at the meſſage, but bore it with
heroic reſolution; and, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that ſhe had three days to prepare
for death, ſhe ſeemed diſpleaſed at ſo long a delay. Guilford Dudley
was the firſt that ſuffered: as the Lady was conducted to execution, the
officers of the Tower met her on the way, bearing the headleſs body of her
huſband, ſtreaming with blood, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be interred in the chapel in
the Tower: ſhe looked on the corpſe without trembling, and only, with a
ſigh, deſired to proceed. She teſtified, to the laſt moment of her
ſufferings, great conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, great piety, and an immoveable adherence to
the reformation. This was the ſecond Queen who died by the hands of the
executioner in England.</p>
            <p>The enemies of the ſtate being thus ſuppreſſed, the theatre
was now opened for the pretended enemies of religion. The Queen was freed from
all apprehenſions of an inſurrection, and therefore began by aſſembling
a corrupt parliament, which was to countenance her future cruelties. The
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, whoſe only religion ſeemed that of the Prince who governed, were
eaſily gained over, and the houſe of commons ſeemed paſſive in all
her proceedings. She began by giving orders for the ſuppreſſion of
married Biſhops and prieſts; the maſs was directed to be reſtored; the
Pope's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was re-eſtabliſhed, with ſome reſtrictions; the laws
againſt heretics were renewed, and the <pb n="269" facs="tcp:0443100201:272"/> church and its
privileges put upon the ſame foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in which they were before the
alterations of Henry VIII.</p>
            <p>This was kindling up the fires of perſecution anew: at the head of
theſe meaſures were Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Biſhop of Wincheſter, and Bonner,
Biſhop of London. Poole, the Pope's Legate, a great part of whoſe life was
ſpent in Italy, ſeemed too much civilized in that country, then the moſt
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite in Europe, to be acceſſory to the meaſures now purſued.
Gardiner began this bloody ſcene with Hooper and Rogers: Hooper had been
Biſhop of Glouceſter; Rogers was a clergyman, who had ſhone amongſt the
moſt diſtinguiſhed of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. He was prebendary of St.
Paul's, and refuſed all ſubmiſſion to the church of Rome, which he
looked upon as antichriſtian. They were condemned by commiſſioners
appointed by the Queen, the Chancellor at the head of them. Rogers ſuffered
in Smithfield: when he was brought to the ſtake, he had it in his power to
ſave himſelf, by recanting his opinions; but neither hopes nor fears could
prevail upon him to deſert his religion. When the faggots were placed around
him, he ſeemed no way daunted at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, but cried out, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>I reſign my life with joy, in teſtimony of
the doctrine of Jeſus.</hi>
               </q> Hooper had his pardon offered him upon the
ſame terms, but he refuſed it with equal indignation. This old mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, who
was executed at Glouceſter, was three quarters of an hour in torment; the
fire, either from malice or neglect, had not been ſufficiently kindled, ſo
that his legs and thighs were firſt burnt, and one of his hands dropped off
before he expired.</p>
            <p>Saunders and Taylor, two other clergymen, whoſe zeal had been
diſtinguiſhed in carrying on <pb n="270" facs="tcp:0443100201:273"/> the reformation, were
the next that ſuffered Taylor was put into a pitch barrel, and before the
fire was kindled, a faggot from an unknown hand was thrown at his head, which
ſtreamed with blood: ſtill, however, he continued undaunted, ſinging the
xxxiſt Pſalm in Engliſh, which one of the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators obſerving, hit
him a blow on the ſide of the head, and commanded him to pray in Latin: he
therefore continued a few minutes ſilent, only with his eyes ſtedfaſtly
fixed upon heaven; when one of the guards, either through impatience or
compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſtruck him down with his halbert, and thus delivered him
from a world of pain to a life of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal happineſs.</p>
            <p>The death of theſe only ſerved to encreaſe the ſavage
appetite of the Monks and Popiſh Biſhops for freſh ſlaughter. Bonner,
bloated at once with rage and luxury, let looſe his vengeance without
reſtraint; while the Queen, by letters, exhorted him to purſue the pious
work without pity or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption: and now Ridley, Biſhop of London, and the
venerable Latimer, Biſhop of Worceſter, were to receive the Martyr's crown.
Ridley was one of the ableſt champions of the reformation; his piety,
learning, and ſolidity of judgment, were admired by his friends and dreaded
by his enemies. The night before his execution he invited the mayor of Oxford,
and his wife, to ſee him die; and, when he ſaw them melted into tears, he
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf appeared quite unmoved, heaven being his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſupporter and
comforter in this hour of agony. When he came to the ſtake where he was to be
burnt, he found his old friend Latimer there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and began to comfort
him in his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, while Latimer was as ready to return the kind office.
A furious bigot aſcended to preach to <pb n="271" facs="tcp:0443100201:274"/> them, before the
execution of their ſentence: Ridley gave a ſerious attention to the
ſermon, and offered to anſwer it, but this he was not allowed to do. At
length the fire was ſet to the pile; Latimer was ſoon out of pain, but
Ridley continued much longer, his legs being conſumed before the fire reached
his vitals.</p>
            <p>Cranmer, whom you have ſeen already ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the
reformation, was the next perſonage of note that was burnt: he had this
peculiar ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of his calamity, that he was prevailed upon to abjure his
principles and ſign his recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the hopes of pardon. Being,
notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, brought to the ſtake, his confuſion and ſhame
were there inexpreſſible: there he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted all that their falſe
promiſes had made him abjure; and, reſolving that the hand which had
ſigned ſhould firſt ſuffer, he held it out, with an intrepid
countenance, in the flames, till it dropped off, frequently crying out, in the
midſt of his ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>that unworthy hand!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bonner now ſeemed not ſatisfied with ſingle deaths, but ſent
men in whole companies to the flames; women themſelves were not ſpared: but
the cruelty went yet farther; a woman, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for hereſy, was delivered
of a child in the midſt of the flames; ſome of the ſpectators hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely
ſnatched it out; the magiſtrate, who was a Papiſt, ordered it to be flung
in again, and it was then conſumed with the mother. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrators of
ſuch actions were no longer human; they muſt have forfeited all
pretenſions to the name, for hell itſelf could be guilty of nothing more
atrocious!</p>
            <p>But they were not content with puniſhing the living alone, their
vengeance extended even to the <pb n="272" facs="tcp:0443100201:275"/> dead: Bucer and Fagius,
two German divines, who had been dead ſome years before, were cited, very
formally, to appear and give an account of their faith; in default of their
appearance, their bodies were taken from their graves, and being hung upon a
gallows were conſumed to aſhes. The wife of Peter Martyr, who himſelf had
the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to eſcape, was dug up like the former, and buried in a dung
hill. In ſhort, the perſecutions of the prieſts and friars went ſuch
lengths, that the very magiſtrates who had at firſt been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of
their cruelty, at laſt refuſed to aſſiſt at the puniſhing heretics
for the future, till a court, ſomewhat reſembling the inquiſition, was
eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, which continued the ſlaughters without remorſe. In this
reign five biſhops, twenty-one miniſters, and above eight hundred others,
went to the flames in maintenance of the truth; num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers died in priſon, and
ſeveral by whips and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were forced to abjure.</p>
            <p>Yet, ſtill in this diſmal ſituation with reſpect to
religion, the temporal concerns of the nation were conducted with very little
better ſucceſs. Calais, which had long been poſſeſſed by the
Engliſh, and was a curb to the ambition of France, was taken in this reign by
the Duke of Guiſe, and all the Engliſh drove out of it, as the great Edward
had drove the French out two hundred years before. The Queen was only bent on
ruining Proteſtants, and took no care to defend her dominions.</p>
            <p>Philip, her huſband, ſeemed no way pleaſed with his alliance:
the Queen, ſome time after their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, was delivered of a falſe
conception. This created diſguſt in him: he quitted England, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to
purſue his own ſchemes in Flanders, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0443100201:276"/> the
Queen ſufficiently mortified at his coldneſs for her, of which he gave
repeated proofs.</p>
            <p>The loſs of Calais, and the diſappointment with regard to her
pregnancy, ſoon excited murmurs among the people. The Proteſtants now
exerted their influence in expoſing the weakneſs of the government and the
cruelty of the council: but no perſon had a greater ſhare of reproach than
the Queen, and none felt it ſo ſeverely. The houſe of commons, that had
hitherto been all along ſo ſubmiſſive, now alſo teſtified their
diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and refuſed to grant a ſubſidy, though ſhe
condeſcended to lay the bad ſtate of her affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. During
theſe mortifications her health ſenſibly declined: ſhe was naturally
melancholy and ſullen, and her repeated diſappointments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed her
diſtemper. She had been ill attended during her pretended pregnancy, having
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted herſelf to the care of women, and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the advice of her
phyſicians. After having been for ſome time afflicted with the dropſy,
this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der carried her off in the forty-third year of her age, after a
reign of about five years. Had ſhe been born at any other period, ſhe might
have been a good Princeſs, but her zeal for religion was louder than the
calls of humanity. Henry VIII, her father, acted like a tyrant and a
perſecutor from vicious motives, and he knew it: Mary was both a tyrant and a
perſecutor from motives of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and ſhe was never undeceived.</p>

            <p>WERE we to adopt the maxim in morals, that evil may be done for the
production of good, one might ſay that the perſecutions in Mary's reign
were permitted only to bring the kingdom over to the Proteſtant religion.
Nothing could preach ſo effectually againſt the cruelty and the vices of
the Monks, as the actions of the Monks themſelves: wherever heretics were to
be burnt, they were always preſent, rejoicing at the ſpectacle, inſulting
the fallen, and frequently the firſt to thruſt the flaming brand againſt
the faces of the condemned. The Engliſh were effectually converted by ſuch
ſights as theſe; to bring any people over to any opinion, it is only
neceſſary to perſecute inſtead of attempting to convince: the people
had formerly embraced the reformed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from fear, they were now
internally Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants from inclination.</p>
            <p>We have hitherto ſeen England like the element that ſurrounds
it, ever unſettled and ſtormy; ever ſinking under foreign invaſion or
domeſtic diſputes: it had felt a ſhort interval of happineſs, indeed,
under Henry VII, but his ſucceſſors ſoon diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that felicity,
and laid the country once more in blood. At length the genius of the people
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over all oppoſition, and England was now about to make its own
happineſs, and to ſet man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind an example of induſtry, commerce, freedom,
learning, opulence, and power.</p>
            <p>To Mary ſucceeded her ſiſter Elizabeth, who was unanimouſly
declared Queen at the accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed places, and with the acclamations of the
people. Elizabeth had her education in that beſt of ſchools, 
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0443100201:278"/> the ſchool of adverſity: as during the life of her
ſiſter, who had no children, ſhe was next heir to the throne, and at the
ſame time was known to be of the Proteſtant religion, ſhe was obnoxious
to the reigning tyrant for two reaſons: it was fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe might aſpire
to the throne during her ſiſter's life; but it was ſtill more
reaſonably apprehended, that ſhe would, if ever ſhe came to the crown,
make an innovation in that religion which Mary took ſo much pains to
eſtabliſh. The Biſhops, who had ſhed ſuch a deluge of blood,
foreſaw this, and often told Mary, that her deſtroying meaner heretics was
of no advantage to the ſtate, unleſs ſhe attacked the principal heretic;
that it was to no purpoſe to lop off the branches while the body of the tree
was ſuffered to ſtand: Mary ſaw and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the juſtice of their
obſervations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined her ſiſter with proper guards, and only waited
for ſome new inſurrection, or ſome favourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to deſtroy her:
her own death prevented the perpetration of her meditated cruelty, and
Elizabeth was taken from a priſon to be fixed upon a throne.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth had made the proper uſe of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement; being
debarred the enjoyment of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures abroad, ſhe ſought for knowledge at
home; ſhe cultivated her underſtanding, learned the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages and
ſciences; but, of all the arts in which ſhe excelled, her arts of keeping
fair with her ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of not offending the Papiſts, of being in
eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem with the Proteſtants, of diſſembling and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reign,
were the greateſt.</p>
            <p>This virgin Monarch, whoſe memory England ſtill reveres with
gratitude and reſpect, was ſcarce proclaimed Queen, when Philip of Spain,
who had been married to Mary, but who ever teſtified an inclination for
Elizabeth, ſought her in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0443100201:279"/> What political
motives Elizabeth might have againſt this match, is uncertain; but certain it
is, ſhe neither liked the perſon nor the religion of her admirer: ſhe was
willing at once to enjoy the pleaſure of independance and the vanity of
nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ſolicitations.</p>
            <p>She had ever reſolved upon reforming the church, even in the
reſtraints of a priſon; and, upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the throne, ſhe immediately
ſet about that great deſign. The people were now almoſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the
Proteſtant religion; the ill uſe the Papiſts had made of their power, in
the laſt reign, had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally undone their cauſe: a religion, marked with
cruelty, tyranny, and perſecution, was not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for the people of
England. She began, therefore, in imitation of the deceaſed Queen, to forbid
all meddling with controverſy in the pulpit, and all innovations of the
eſtabliſhed rites, except that the ſervice ſhould be performed in the
vulgar tongue, till a parliament ſhould determine the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per modes of
worſhip. The parliament ſoon met, and the reformation was finiſhed, and
religion eſtabliſhed in the manner we enjoy it at preſent.</p>
            <p>The oppoſition which was made to theſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
eſtabliſhments was but weak; a conference of nine doctors on each ſide
was propoſed and agreed to; they were to diſpute publicly upon either
ſide of the queſtion, and it was reſolved that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould hold
to that which came off with vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. Diſputations of this kind are never
attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with conviction to either party; ſo much is to be ſaid on either
ſide, and ſo wide is the field that both ſides have to range in, that
each generally loſes his ſtrength in vain preparations, and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
prefacing, before he is properly ſaid to begin the engagement. The
conference, therefore, came <pb n="277" facs="tcp:0443100201:280"/> to nothing; the Papiſts
declared, that it was not in their power to diſpute a ſecond time upon
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics, in which they had gained a former victory under Queen Mary; and the
Proteſtants attributed the caution to their fears. Of nine thouſand four
hundred beneficed clergymen, which were in the whole kingdom, only fourteen
Biſhops, twelve Arch-deacons, fifteen heads of colleges, and about eighty of
the parochial clergy, choſe to quit their preferments rather than their
religion. Thus England changed its belief in religion four times ſince Henry
VIII. Strange, ſays a foreign writer, that a people, who are ſo reſolute,
ſhould be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſo much inconſtancy! That the ſame peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who
this day publicly burnt heretics, ſhould the next not only think them
guiltleſs, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to their opinions.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth was now fixed upon a Proteſtant throne, while all the
neighbouring nations were open or ſecret enemies: France, Scotland, Spain,
the Pope, were all combined againſt her. Her ſubjects of Ireland were
concealed enemies, and the Catholic party in England, though not ſo numerous
as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, yet was not entirely ſuppreſſed: theſe were the dangers
ſhe had to fear, nor had ſhe one friend to aſſiſt her upon an
emergency. In this ſituation, therefore, ſhe could hope for no other
reſource, but what proceeded from the affection of her own ſubjects, and
the wiſdom of her adminiſtration. To make herſelf beloved by the people,
and, at the ſame time, feared by her courtiers, were the governing maxims of
her conduct. She was frugal of the public treaſury, and ſtill more
ſparing in her rewards to her favourites: this at once kept the people in
ſpirits, and kept the great too poor to ſhake off lawful ſubjection. She
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0443100201:281"/> both rewards and puniſhments with
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality; knew when to flatter and when to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid; could diſſemble
ſubmiſſion, but preſerve her prerogative: in ſhort, ſhe ſeemed to
have ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the people ſhe was to govern, and often to have flattered
their follies in order to ſecure their hearts.</p>
            <p>Her chief miniſter was Robert Dudley, ſon to the late Duke of
Northumberland, whom the Queen ſeemed to regard from capricious motives, as
he had neither abilities nor virtue; but, to make amends, the two favourites
next in power were Bacon and Cecil, men of great capacity and infinite
application. They regulated the finances, and directed the political meaſures
that were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with ſo much ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Mary Stewart, Queen of France and Scotland, gave the firſt alarm
to this ſtate of tranquility, by taking the title of Queen of England; and
her cauſe was ſupported by the Popiſh faction, which ſtill wanted to
make new diſturbances. The throne of Elizabeth was not yet perfectly fixed,
and the intrigues of religion could ſtill overturn it: ſhe therefore was
not remiſs in ſending an army into Scotland, and forcing the French troops
out of that kingdom, by a treaty ſigned to that effect. Soon after the King
of France died, and Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth forced her rival to renounce the title of Queen
of England, which ſhe had aſſumed. She went yet ſtill farther, ſhe
encouraged the parliament of Scotland to introduce the reformation into that
country; her intrigues ſucceeded, and ſhe thus gained over a ſtedfaſt
friend in the Scots, from whom the Engliſh had, till then, only received
repeated acts of enmity and ill-will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:0443100201:282"/> This tempeſt was ſcarce allayed, when
Philip of Spain gave new alarms. As long as he had fears from the power of the
Queen of Scots, by her union with France, he was ſtill attached to Elizabeth;
but, when, by the death of the King of France her huſband, ſhe was again
reduced to her primitive weakneſs, his jealouſy then began to fall upon
Elizabeth. With this view he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the inſurrections and diſcontents
in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and Elizabeth with equal care ſuppreſſed them. He
ſupported, in France, a league made to exclude the royal family from the
throne; Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth protected the oppoſite ſide. He oppreſſed the people
of Holland with cruelty and injuſtice; Elizabeth ſupported them from
ſinking under his power. Thus, on every ſide, ſhe guarded off the dangers
that threatened her, and ſoon after, in her turn, prepared to act
offenſively againſt her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>But the cares of war did not repreſs her aſſiduity in the
adminiſtration of juſtice at home: ſhe was reſolved to ſhew the Roman
Catholic party an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of moderation, which they might admire but could not
imitate. The Monks, who were diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of their monaſteries,
had been aſſigned pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which were to be paid by the
poſſeſſors of the forfeited lands. Theſe payments were entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neglected, and theſe unhappy men, who had been educated in ſolitude and
ignorance, were now ſtarving in old-age, too much diſregarded by the
Proteſtants, and too numerous to find relief from thoſe of their own
perſuaſion. Elizabeth ordered that their penſions ſhould be paid with
punctuality and juſtice, and ſatisfaction made for all arrears unjuſtly
detained.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0443100201:283"/> In order the more to ingratiate herſelf
with the people, ſhe viſited Cambridge and Oxford, and made each a Latin
ſpeech, and ſhewed, by her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and conduct, a regard for thoſe
ſeminaries of learning, which had been ſuppreſſed by her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>She not only affected this obliging carriage to her inferiors, but
alſo behaved in ſomething of a romantic ſtrain to the courtiers next her
perſon. The gallantries of the court were conducted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules
of chivalry: every damſel had her knight; Dudley, who was now become Earl of
Leiceſter, was generally the Queen's: but all writers agree, that her
paſſion for him never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded beyond the bounds of Platonic affection.
When her commons, in a dutiful manner, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to her how much the
ſafety of the kingdom depended upon her marrying, ſhe thanked them in an
obliging manner, and aſſured them ſhe was now become the wife of her
people, and would be pleaſed at having it inſcribed on her tomb, that
having reigned with equity, ſhe lived and died a virgin.</p>

            <p>THE ancient ferocity of the Engliſh was not yet quite reclaimed:
the barbarous method of fixing the Monarch upon the throne, by exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
performed upon the ſcaffold, was not quite done away: the only difference
ſeemed to be, that formerly thoſe who were obnoxious to the crown, fell
without any legal trial; but now they fell with all the forms, yet all the
ſeverity of juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:0443100201:284"/> While Elizabeth was thus attempting to
ſettle religion, to eſtabliſh the power, and humble the enemies of her
country, ſhe at the ſame time was guilty of ſome inſtances of cruelty,
which, tho' coloured with the pretext of law, could only be the effect of the
yet uncivilized diſpoſition of the times. The Catholics held meetings to
reſtore their religion by open force: the Counteſs of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox, Arthur Poole,
and others, began to form fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the kingdom: their plottings, however,
were diſcovered, and, upon their own confeſſion, they were condemned; but
the Queen, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their illuſtrious deſcent, forgave their
offence. A ſiſter of the late Jane Grey, however, though leſs guilty, met
with leſs clemency: ſhe had married the Earl of Pembroke, without leave
from the court; this was conſidered as an high offence, and the Earl and
ſhe were committed to the Tower. After a long impriſonment he was obliged
to forſake her; and ſhe, loaded with the misfortune, died in
confinement.</p>
            <p>But this only prepared the way for a cruelty of a more heinous
nature, which gave the world a diſagreeable remembrance of the tranſactions
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the reign of her father. Mary, Queen of Scots, had long renounced
her title to the crown of England, but not her claim of ſucceeding to the
throne: this renunciation, however, being extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from her by Elizabeth, Mary
took every method of diſturbing her in the quiet poſſeſſion of the
crown, and yet gave every mark of reconciliation and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere amity. There
were, in fact, many circumſtances to contribute to their mutual diſlike:
the jealouſy of neighbouring crowns, the oppoſition of religion, of wit,
and of beauty; Mary, leſs powerful, leſs abſolute, leſs politic, was,
however, Elizabeth's <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0443100201:285"/> ſuperior in perſonal charms,
and this only ſerved to inflame their animoſity. The Queen of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
encouraged the Catholic faction in England, while Elizabeth, with ſtill more
ſucceſs, fomented the Proteſtant party among the Scots. Mary had now, for
ſome time, thoughts of marrying a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond huſband, after the death of the
French King; Elizabeth, on the other hand, who had no thoughts of marriage
herſelf, ſtrove, by every art, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this marriage, as ſhe
conſidered that it would be ſtrengthening the power of her rival. With this
view ſhe wrote Mary a letter, in which, after many inſincere
proteſtations of friendſhip, ſhe begged that Mary would not offer to
marry till her conſent ſhould firſt be obtained. This unreaſonable
requeſt not a little diſturbed the Queen of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but, fearing to
offend her potent rival, ſhe pretended to comply; in ſecret, however, ſhe
was reſolved to marry the Earl of Darnly, her rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who had the merit of
being a Catholic, like herſelf; but, perhaps, whoſe greateſt
recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations were his ſize and his perſon, which were large and comely.
The party gained by Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, in Scotland, tried every meaſure to prevent
her deſign. It was agitated, whether the Queen could marry without the
conſent of the ſtates; ſeveral of the nobility roſe in arms to prevent
it, the ambaſſadors of England made daily remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances upon its
impropriety, but all in vain: Mary, to cut ſhort their proceedings, had the
marriage ſolemnized in her own chapel, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the oppoſers by a
ſolemn act of the ſtates.</p>
            <p>All hitherto appeared fortunate for Mary; her enemies baniſhed,
her rival defeated, and herſelf married to the man ſhe loved: yet this was
but a flattering calm, for ſoon, whether from the capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs 
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0443100201:286"/> of her temper, or from what other cauſe I will not
pretend to determine, Lord Darnly, notwithſtanding the elegance of his
perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came entirely diſagreeable to her. She had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch an
averſion to him, that it was ſoon obvious, even to the people; and ſhe
took every method to mortify him in the eyes of the public. Her vices were the
cauſe of all her misfortunes: there was, at that time in her court, one David
Rizzio, the ſon of a muſician at Turin, who had followed the ambaſſador
from that court into Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. As he underſtood muſic to perfection, and
ſung a good baſs, he was introduced into the Queen's concert, who was ſo
taken with him, that ſhe deſired the ambaſſador, upon his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to leave Rizzio behind. The excellence of his voice ſoon procured him greater
familiarities; the Queen loved him, confided in him, and ever kept him next her
perſon. The new King, who now only had the name, could not, without
jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, ſee this inſinuating foreigner receive all the Queen's
favours, while he was treated only with contempt. Stung at once with envy,
rage, and reſentment, he at length reſolved to murder the man he could not
equal, and conſulted with ſome Lords about the method of accompliſhing
his cruel deſign. Men in power ever find accomplices in their guilt; two
other Lords and he ſettled it, that the murder ſhould be committed before
the face of the Queen, as a puniſhment of her ſcandalous conduct: thus
prepared, they were informed that Rizzio was, at that very inſtant, in the
Queen's chamber; Lord Darnly led the way, conducting the aſſaſſins up
by a private ſtair-caſe, and entering the Queen's chamber, who was at table
with her favourite Rizzio; Darnly ſtood for ſome time lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0443100201:287"/> upon the back of her chair. His fierce looks, and
unexpected intruſion, in ſome meaſure alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Queen, who, however,
kept ſilence, not daring to call out: a little after Lord Ruthven, one of the
murderers, and George Douglas, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abruptly, all in arms, and attended
with more of their accomplices. The Queen could no longer refrain, but aſked
the reaſon of this bold intruſion; Ruthven made her no anſwer, but
ordered Rizzio to quit a place of which he was unworthy. Rizzio now ſaw that
he was the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their vengeance, and, trembling with fear, took hold of
the Queen's robe, to put himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her protection, who, on her part,
ſtrove to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe between the aſſaſſins and him: Douglas, in the
mean time, had reached the unfortunate Rizzio, and, taking a dagger from the
King's ſide, drew it, and, while the Queen filled the room with her cries, he
plunged it, in her preſence, into Rizzio's boſom. She was five months gone
with child, and this horrid ſcene had ſuch an effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fruit of her
womb, that it is ſaid that her child, who was afterwards King James I, could
never venture to look upon a drawn ſword without ſhuddering. Thus ended
Rizzio, a man who has been more ſpoken of, than perhaps any other who roſe
from ſo mean a ſtation. What his other ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents to pleaſe might have
been, is unknown; but certain it is, that ſeveral indications of his ſkill
in muſic remain even to the preſent time: all thoſe pleaſing Scotch
airs, which are ſet in ſuch a peculiar taſte, being univerſally allowed
to be of his compoſition.</p>
            <p>This was but a temporary check upon Mary's power; ſhe reſumed
her authority, by the influence of her charms upon the Earl her huſband, who 
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0443100201:288"/> gave up the murderers of Rizzio to her reſentment, but
they had previouſly eſcaped into England. One criminal engagement, however,
was ſcarcely got over, when Mary fell into a ſecond: the Earl of Bothwell
now began to hold the ſame place in her affections that Rizzio had formerly
poſſeſſed. This new amour was attended with ſtill more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
conſequences than the former; her huſband fell a victim to it. His life was
firſt attempted by poiſon, but the ſtrength of his conſtitution ſaved
him for a ſhort time, only to fall by a more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death: he was
ſtrangled by night, the houſe in which the fact was committed being blown
up with gun-powder, in order to perſuade the people that his death was
accidental; but his ſhirt not being ſinged, and his ſlippers found near
him, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with blue marks round his neck, ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the
ſuſpicion of his real murder. His body was buried near that of Rizzio,
among the Scottiſh Kings.</p>
            <p>All orders of the ſtate, the whole body of people, accuſed
Bothwell of this aſſaſſination, and at laſt demanded juſtice upon
him from the Queen, for the late murder, openly arraigning him of the guilt. In
this univerſal demand for juſtice, the Queen, deaf to the murmurs of her
people, deaf to the voice of decency, married the murderer of her huſband,
and prevailed upon him to divorce his former wife to make way for this fatal
alliance.</p>
            <p>Bothwell was poſſeſſed of all the inſolence which attends
great crimes: he aſſembled the principal Lords of the ſtate, and
compelled them to ſign an inſtrument, purporting, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>that they judged it the Queen's intereſt to
marry Bothwell, as he had lain with her againſt her will.</hi>
               </q> Theſe
tranſactions excited the whole kingdom of Scotland to reſiſtance, and 
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0443100201:289"/> Mary, abandoned by her followers, was obliged to give
herſelf up as a priſoner to the confederacy. Bothwell fled to the Orkney
iſlands. The Queen, being confined in Lochlevin caſtle, was compelled to
reſign the crown to her ſon, as yet a child; but ſhe was permitted to
nominate a regent. She turned her eyes upon the Earl of Murray, who was then in
France, and appointed him, expecting that he would defend her cauſe, and
reſtore her. In this, however, ſhe was entirely deceived; Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, upon his
arrival, inſtead of comforting her as he formerly uſed, loaded her with
reproaches, which reduced her almoſt to deſpair. The cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the
great, however juſtly deſerved, excite pity and create friends; an army of
forty thouſand men declared in her favour, and ſhe eſcaped from priſon
to put herſelf at their head. But this was only to encounter new misfortunes;
ſhe was met by a body of but four thouſand, commanded by the new regent,
and was totally defeated. For fear of falling into the hands of her enemies,
ſhe fled towards the borders of England; Elizabeth, being informed of her
misfortunes and her retreat, at firſt granted her an honourable reception,
and ordered her to be lodged at a gentleman's houſe, where ſhe was treated
with fitting dignity. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this kindneſs, ſhe refuſed to
ſee her until ſhe had juſtified herſelf from the reproaches with which
ſhe was branded. By this means Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth in a manner declared herſelf
umpire of the differences between the two parties, and each ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
pleaded their cauſe before her; Mary by her emiſſaries, and Murray, the
regent, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. It was the Queen of England's duty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, and not
to examine, her royal fugitive: however, ſhe lengthened out the pleadings on
both <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0443100201:290"/> ſides, and enjoyed the pleaſure of ſeeing her
rival humbled, without paſſing any definitive ſentence. Mary privately
complained of her unworthy treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and long delay; theſe complaints were
car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Elizabeth, which ended in the Queen of Scots being ſent a
priſoner to Tutbury caſtle.</p>
            <p>The diſaſters of the crown of Scotland fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the people,
divided as they were into factions, and animated with mutual animoſity. The
regent, attempting to quell them, was himſelf ſlain, and the
aſſaſſins, pretending to act in the name of their impriſoned Queen,
made an incurſion into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and committed ſome ravages on the frontier
counties. Elizabeth, with an army, quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed theſe invaders, and
procured the Earl of Lenox, brother to the late regent, to be elected in his
room. In the mean time, while ſhe was employed in bringing Scotland to
meaſures, ſhe found herſelf attacked, in her own dominions, by a
conſpiracy: the Pope, in order to aſſiſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, procured a bull
to be fixed up in ſeveral places in London, whereby he excommunicated
Elizabeth, and abſolved her ſubjects from their oath of allegiance. This
bull was fixed up by John Felton, grand uncle to him whom we are ſhortly to
ſee act another deſperate part: John Felton, when he was told that the
government was in purſuit of him, diſdained to fly; he waited with
intrepidity till he was taken, and then boldly confeſſed the fact of which
he was charged, and gloried in the commiſſion: he might have received
pardon upon acknowledging his crime, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it, and was hanged near
the place, meeting death with a reſolution that aſtoniſhed even the
brave. What noble actions might not ſuch a mind <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0443100201:291"/> have
been capable of, had it at firſt received a right direction.</p>
            <p>Theſe efforts, in favour of the Queen of Scots, only ſerved to
haſten her ruin. The two Queens entered into various negotiations and
frivolous treaties; the one attempting to humble her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, the other,
with fruitleſs pride, attempting to preſerve the luſtre of fallen
Majeſty. Scotland, in the mean time, ſtreamed with blood: the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
and the Proteſtants carried on a civil war. The Archbiſhop of St. Andrew's,
one of the warmeſt partizans of Mary, was taken in arms, and executed upon
the depoſition of his confeſſor, who ſwore that this prelate had
privately confeſſed that he was an accomplice in the murder of Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>The greateſt misfortunes of Mary rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from her
friends than enemies. The Duke of Norfolk, who profeſſed a friendſhip for
her, expected, by her means, to riſe to the Britiſh throne: he, therefore,
privately negotiated a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with her, and ſhe, on the other hand,
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to break off that which ſhe had already contracted with Bothwell.
He formed a party in London, feeble indeed; but he expected aſſiſtance
from the intrigues of the Pope, and the arms of Spain: he was himſelf a weak
man, and his plots were but ſhallow; the ſpies of Elizabeth diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them all: he was arreſted, accuſed, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and executed. This
nobleman's blood only contributed to faſten the chains of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Mary; yet, ſtill, ſhe conceived hopes from foreign aſſiances, which
ſeldom are of any weight in domeſtic diſputes. She had the League in
France in her favour, the Pope, the Spaniards, and the Jeſuits; ſhe not
only hoped to be reinſtated in her <pb n="289" facs="tcp:0443100201:292"/> former power, but
to have the crown of England, to which ſhe laid claim as her birth-right,
added to her own. In purſuance of theſe deſigns, a new conſpiracy was
formed, fourteen of the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors executed, and, laſt of all, Mary was
brought to a trial, before a Queen who had no other right to be her judge, but
that of power. Forty-two members of parliament, and five judges, were ſent to
examine her in priſon; ſhe proteſted againſt their right, yet made a
defence: they had origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally no foundation in juſtice to try her, and they
carried on her accuſation with only a ſhew of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In ſhort, after an
impriſonment of eighteen years, this unhappy Princeſs was brought to the
block, and beheaded in one of the rooms of her priſon, which had been hung in
black for the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. This action ſtained the reign of Elizabeth with
ſuch colours, as neither her diſſimulation, nor the proſperity of her
reign, could ever waſh away: her ſubjects, while they found themſelves
happy, attempted to excuſe her conduct, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience internally
condemned her cruelty, and time, that ſpeaks plain, at laſt declares her
guilt. In treating the actions of mankind, we almoſt ever find both ſides
culpable, and ſo it was here, Mary, who was a murderer and adultereſs, died
by the orders of Elizabeth, who was at once cruel and unjuſt.</p>

            <p>THE conſtitution of England took a long ſeries of years to

tyranny, without puniſhment. Had the actions of Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, which are now the
ſubject of our praiſe, only been performed by one of our preſent
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, they would be ſufficient to cauſe his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion: there is
ſomething lucky in every great reign, like this in view; its luſtre is
rather owing to the indifferent periods that preceded it, than to its own
intrinſic value. Elizabeth left her king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it muſt be owned, in a better
ſtate than ſhe found it; but her actions ſhould be neither the ſubject
of our praiſe, nor the object of our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>We ſee a mixture of cruelty and gallantry in all the
tranſactions of theſe times: while Elizabeth was thus plotting the death of
Mary, ſhe was, at the ſame time, employed in a treaty of marriage with the
young Duke of Anjou. This, however, came to nothing, the Queen reſolving to
enjoy that power uncontrouled, which her ſubjects had not yet learned to
abridge.</p>
            <p>But, though ſhe diſliked an huſband, yet none more
paſſionately deſired to have a lover: it is thought, indeed, her
affections were confined to Platonic wiſhes only, and her age, for ſhe now
began to decline, ſeemed to favour the ſuppoſition; but the choice of her
favourites countenanced the contrary report, and her ſorrow for the Earl of
Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, who died about this time, confirmed it. But one favourite always
made room for another, and Devereux, Earl of Eſſex, ſucceeded Dudley,
Earl of Leiceſter. This nobleman was young, active, ambitious, witty, and
handſome; in the field and at court he ever appeared with ſuperior
luſtre. In all the maſques which were then performed, the Earl and
Elizabeth were generally coupled as part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; <pb n="291" facs="tcp:0443100201:294"/> and,
though ſhe was almoſt ſixty, and he not half that number of years, yet
flattery had taught her to forget the diſparity of age; the world told her
ſhe was ſtill beautiful and young, and ſhe was inclined to think ſo.
This young Earl's intereſt in the Queen's heart, as may natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be
expected, promoted his intereſts in the ſtate: he conducted all things
without a rival, and, wherever he went, he acquired a degree of unbounded
popularity. Young and unexperienced as he was, he at length began to fancy the
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of the people given to his merits, and not to his favour: thus
poſſeſſed of a falſe opinion of his own ſecurity, to uſe the
words of the poet, he kicked down the ladder by which he roſe; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to
deſpiſe the Queen, and was heard to drop ſome expreſſions, that he
thought her, in ſpite of flattery, both old and ugly. Her remonſtrances, on
this occaſion, were ſuch as might have been expected from a diſappointed
girl, very angry, yet wiſhing for a vindication. She gave him, in a
paſſion, a box on the ear, pardoned him, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; he again
tranſgreſſed, and ſhe again par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the offence. Secure in her
affections, he at length proceeded to actual diſobedience; his former favour
had gained him enemies, his preſent inſolence loſt him the friendſhip
of the Queen; he was condemned to retirement, when he might have been capitally
convicted. He now came to a ſenſe of his miſconduct, and was reſolved
to try the long unpractiſed arts that had at firſt brought him into favour.
Immediately after ſentence, when he was preparing for retirement into the
country, he firſt aſſured the Queen, that he could never be happy till he
again ſaw thoſe eyes which were uſed to ſhine upon him with ſuch
luſtre; <pb n="292" facs="tcp:0443100201:295"/> that, in expectance of that happy moment, like
another Nebuchadnezzar, he would dwell with the beaſts of the field, and be
wet with the dew of heaven, till ſhe again propitiouſly took pity on his
ſufferings. This romantic meſſage ſeemed pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly pleaſing to the
Queen; ſhe thought him ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere from the conſciouſneſs of her own
ſincerity: ſhe replied, that, after ſome time, when convinced of his
humility, ſomething perhaps might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from her lenity. This hope of
pardon made him think ſlightly of his guilt: his pride once more increaſing
with his ſucceſs, he laid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of deſtroying his rivals in power,
and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the perſon of the Queen. With this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, he
impriſoned the Queen's meſſengers, headed a few malecontents, and marched
through the city, exhorting the citizens to arms, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out for the
Queen, for the Queen. During a long march, not one citizen thought proper to
join him, though numbers, led by curioſity, ran to ſee him paſs by. In
this diſappointment, word was brought that he was proclaimed a traitor; upon
which he made one effort more to excite an inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but without
ſucceſs: he therefore now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to return to his own houſe, but
found the ſtreet ſecured by a great chain, and a guard of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. As
he ſaw no other way to force his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, but by an attack upon the
guards, attended by his followers, he immediately fell on, but was beat back
and wounded in the thigh. He then went down to the water-ſide, and, putting
himſelf and his retinue on board ſmall boats, he eſcaped to his houſe,
which he fortified in the beſt manner he could. The houſe was ſoon
inveſted by the Lord Admiral, and the Earl and his followers were obliged to
deliver themſelves up: the Earl of <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0443100201:296"/> Southampton was a
companion in his guilt and his misfortunes; they were ſoon after brought to
their trials, and condemned to die: when the day of his death came, the Queen
appeared irreſolute; ſhe ſent an order to ſtop the execution, and
ſoon after ordered it to proceed. However romantic it may ſeem, ſhe felt
in her boſom all the fluctuations of love and reſentment, and was
irreſolute which paſſion to obey: her reſentment, at laſt, prevailed;
he was executed ſix days after his ſentence, and died with penitence and
reſolution.</p>
            <p>Thus ended a favourite who had merits, but did not owe his riſe to
them; he was gallant, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic, and oſtentatious: his genius for ſhews,
and thoſe pleaſures that carry an image of war, was as remarkable as his
ſpirit in the profeſſion itſelf; and, had he been poſſeſſed of
humility equal to his abilities, he at laſt might have mounted a throne
inſtead of a ſcaffold. The Queen, at firſt, carried her reſentment ſo
far as to have a ſermon preached at St. Paul's croſs to blacken his
memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: his haughty behaviour, and unguarded ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, had entirely
alienated her affections, and imprinted an aſperity, which, it ſeems, even
his death could not ſoften.</p>
            <p>With the death of this favourite, Elizabeth's pleaſures ſeemed
to expire; ſhe went through the buſineſs of the ſtate merely from
habit, but her happineſs was no more. Hiſtorians are fond of repreſenting
all their characters without paſſion, and give to every action of the great
either politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or rational motives; they therefore treat this Queen's
affection as a fable, but many of the actions of her life appear dictated by
reſentment or regard, nor ever had woman a greater variety of caprice; the
great feel as the reſt of mankind, <pb n="294" facs="tcp:0443100201:297"/> and her
paſſions were particularly violent and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. She lived but a ſhort
time after the death of Eſſex, and had the mortification of being
forſaken by moſt of her courtiers before ſhe died, who now ſtrove to
court the favour of King James, whom ſhe had appointed her ſucceſſor.
She died in the ſeventieth year of her age, and the forty-fourth of her
reign. Her character differed with her cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; in the beginning of
her reign ſhe was moderate and humble, towards the end haughty and ſevere:
ſhe was indebted to her good fortune that her miniſters were excellent, but
it was owing to her want of wiſdom that her favourites, who were choſen
more immediately by herſelf, were unworthy. Tho' ſhe was poſſeſſed
of excellent ſenſe, yet ſhe never had the diſcernment to diſcover
that ſhe wanted beauty: to flatter her charms, even at the age of
ſixty-five, was the ſureſt way of gaining her intereſt and eſteem.
She was greater in her public than her private character, and they moſt
diſliked and feared her who were placed next her perſon. But, whatever
might have been the Queen's character, the character of her people, at that
period, demands our praiſe and imitation. Permit me to reſerve that
glorious picture of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, ſtruggling to get free from barbarity, to the

            <p>WHATEVER puniſhments or cruelties were exerted in this reign, they
moſtly fell upon the Great; but never was the people of England more happy
internally, or more formidable abroad, than during this period: the vices and
virtues of a nation are often wholly aſcribed to the Monarch who rules them,
but ſuch influence extends only through a narrow ſphere; no ſingle reign,
how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good, nor indeed any ſucceſſion of virtuous reigns, can give
happineſs, morals, and arts, a general ſpread, unleſs the people be
pre-diſpoſed for the reception. From Nerva to Antoninus, what a noble
ſucceſſion of Roman Emperors! and yet, even under them, Rome was
declining faſt into barbarity: it was not owing to Elizabeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, that
England enjoyed all its preſent happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the people, as if
ſpontaneouſly, began to exert their native vigour, and every art and every
genius put forth all their powers.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh were put in poſſeſſion of neither new nor
ſplendid acquiſitions, nor had they ſuch great influence in foreign
courts: but commerce grew up among them, and, almoſt without a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
flouriſhed with vigour. The people now began to know their real element, and
this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them more happy than the foreign conqueſts or the former
victories of their celebrated kings: a nation, which was once ſubject to
every inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the prey of every plunderer, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came powerful,
polite, laborious, and enterprizing. The newly ſucceſsful voyages of the
Spaniards and Portugueſe excited their emulation: they fitted out ſeveral
expeditions for diſcovering a nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern <pb n="296" facs="tcp:0443100201:299"/> paſſage to
China, and, though diſappointed in their aim, their voyages were not wholly
fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; Drake and Cavendiſh ſurrounded the globe, and diſcovered
ſkill and courage ſuperior to thoſe very nations which had firſt
ſhewn them the way. The famous Sir Walter Raleigh, without any
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from the government, colonized New England: theſe
expeditions at length formed one of the moſt powerful marines of Europe, and
they were able to oppoſe the fleet of Spain, called by the boaſting title
of the Invincible Armada, with an hundred ſhips: when this fleet of Spain had
been deſtroyed, partly by tempeſts and partly by conduct, the Engliſh
remained maſters at ſea. This ſuperiority was conſtantly increaſing,
till another victory, gained over the fleet of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip III, gained them a naval
ſovereignty, which they have ever ſince inviolably preſerved, and which
has been ſcarce ever moleſted by a competitor.</p>
            <p>But external commerce was not more cultivated than internal
manufactures: ſeveral of the Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, who were perſecuted from their own
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by the bad conduct of Spain, found an aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in England: theſe
more than repaid the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection they found, by the arts which they
intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and the induſtry which was thus propagated by their example.</p>
            <p>Thus far in the uſeful arts: but, in the polite arts, England
excelled all the world, ſo that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny writers fix the Auguſtan age of
literature to that period. The diſputes, cauſed by the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
religion, had retarded the progreſs of our language among the powerful, yet
ſpread a love of literature among the lower orders of the ſtate. The people
now began to learn to read, and the Bible, tranſlated into the vulgar tongue,
was not <pb n="297" facs="tcp:0443100201:300"/> only ſerviceable in improving their morals,
but their taſte. The perſecution of Mary was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, of great detriment
to the language; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, being driven into foreign countries, on their
return, introduced, into their ſermons, a language compounded of thoſe
dialects which they had acquired abroad, and the language of England was
actually in a ſtate of barbarity, when Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth came to the throne. Latin
ſermons were in faſhion, and few of the nobility had either the courage, or
the taſte, to declare themſelves the patrons of learning.</p>
            <p>Either the fortune, or the diſcernment of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, made Parker
Archbiſhop of Canterbury; and he ſet himſelf affiduouſly to reform the
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of ſtyle, both by precept and example: for this purpoſe he
reviewed and corrected the Engliſh tranſlation of the Bible, and printed it
with royal magnificence. His own ſtyle had all the eloquence of the times; it
was manly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, but wanted ſmoothneſs.</p>
            <p>The Earl of Eſſex, a ſketch of whoſe hiſtory you have
ſeen, was himſelf one of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers of our language: his
education had freed him from the technical barbarities of the ſchools, and
his ſtyle ran on unembarraſſed by the ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of pedantry. His
letters (particularly that which he wrote from Ireland to the Queen) are
regarded as models of fine writing to this day. Sir Walter Raleigh has the
reputation of being one of the improvers of our language, and none can
conteſt with him the honour of being foremoſt in the improvement of our
hiſtory. Hooker, the author of the Eccleſiaſtical Polity, was the firſt
Engliſhman whoſe ſtyle, upon theological ſubjects, does honour to his
memory, as a ſcholar and a <pb n="298" facs="tcp:0443100201:301"/> gentleman. But what
particularly deſerves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, is, that a man, like him, bred up in pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and ſecluſion from the polite, ſhould expreſs himſelf in a more
modern and elegant manner than his contemporary authors, Sidney or Raleigh, who
were bred at court.</p>
            <p>I ſhall mention only one proſe writer more, the greateſt and
wiſeſt of all our Engliſh philoſophers, and perhaps the greateſt
philoſopher among men; I need hardly mention the name of Francis Bacon, Lord
Verulam; his ſtyle is copious and correct, and his learning only
ſurpaſſed by his genius.</p>
            <p>Among the poets, two of particular note attract our attention,
Spenſer and Shakeſpear; to attempt an encomium of either is needleſs; all
praiſe muſt be too low for their merits, or unneceſſary to make them
more known.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the Engliſh now began to rival the Spaniards, who, at
that time, aimed at univerſal monarchy, both in arts and arms: the city of
London became more large and more beautiful; the people of the country began to
conſider agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture as one of the moſt uſeful and honourable
employments; the Engliſh were, in power, the ſecond nation in Europe, and
they were, ſhortly, to become the greateſt, by becoming the moſt
free.</p>
            <p>During this reign, a few ſuffered death for their religious
opinions; but we may venture to aſſert, that they raiſed the
diſturbances by which they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, for thoſe who lived in quiet were
permitted to enjoy their opinions under the neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints.</p>
            <p>If we look through hiſtory, and conſider the riſe of kingdoms,
we ſhall not find, in all its vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, ſuch an inſtance of a nation
becoming wiſe, powerful, and happy, in ſo ſhort a time. 
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0443100201:302"/> The ſource of our felicity began in Henry VII, and,
tho' repreſſed by the intervening tyrannies, yet, before the end of
Elizabeth's reign, who was only his grand-daughter, the people became the
moſt poliſhed and the moſt happy people upon earth. Liberty, it is true,
as yet continued to fluctuate: Elizabeth knew her own power, and often
ſtretched it to the very limits of deſpotiſm; but, when commerce was
introduced, liberty ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily entered in its train; for there never was
a nation perfectly commercial and perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotic.</p>

            <p>YOU are now to turn to a reign, which, tho' not ſplendid, was
uſeful: the Engliſh only wanted a ſeaſon of peace, to bring thoſe
arts to perfection which were planted in the preceding reign. No Monarch was
fonder of peace than James I, who ſucceeded Elizabeth; and none ever enjoyed
a reign of more laſting tranquility. Hiſtorians, for what reaſon I know
not, are fond of deſcribing this Monarch's tranſactions with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule;
but, for my own part, I cannot avoid giving juſt applauſe, both to his
wiſdom and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
            <p>King James came to the throne with the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal approbation of
all orders of the ſtate; for, in his perſon was united every claim to the
crown, that either deſcent, bequeſt, or parliamentary ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could
confer. But, on his firſt arrival, it was readily ſeen that he by no means
approved of the treatment of his mother, Mary Queen of Scots; 
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0443100201:303"/> and not only refuſed to wear mourning himſelf for
the late Queen, by whom ſhe had been beheaded; but alſo denied
admiſſion to any who appeared in mourning upon her account.</p>
            <p>Upon a review of his conduct, there are few of this Monarch's
actions that do not ſeem to ſpring from motives of juſtice and virtue;
his only error ſeems to conſiſt in applying the deſpotic laws and
maxims of the Scottiſh government to the Engliſh conſtitution, which was
not ſuſceptible of them. He began his reign by a laudable attempt to unite
both the kingdoms into one, but this the jealouſy of the Engliſh prevented:
they were apprehenſive, that the poſts and employments, which were in the
gift of the court, might be conferred on the Scotch, whom they were, as yet,
taught to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard as foreigners. By his repulſe in this inſtance, he found
the people he came to govern very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe he had left, and
perceived that the liberty and the ſpirit of the Engliſh could not be
reſtrained by the ſhadows of divine right and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience.</p>
            <p>He now, therefore, attempted to correct his firſt miſtake, and
to peruſe the Engliſh laws as he had formerly done thoſe of his own
country, and by theſe he was reſolved to govern. He was in this ſecond
attempt diſappointed in his aim: in a government ſo fluctuating as that of
England, cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom was ever deviating from law, and what was enacted in one
reign was contradicted, by prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, in another: the laws and the manners of
England were, at this particular juncture, very different from each other. The
laws had all along declared in favour of an almoſt unlimited prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative:
the preſent manners, on the contrary, were formed by inſtruments, and upon
principles of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. <pb n="301" facs="tcp:0443100201:304"/> All the Kings and Queens before
him, except ſuch as were weakened by inteſtine divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or the dread
of approaching invaſion, iſſued rather commands than received advice from
their parliaments: James was early ſenſible of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in this
reſpect, and ſtrove to eſtabliſh the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative upon the laws,
unmindful of the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manners among the people, who had, in the reign
of Queen Mary, got an idea of their own power, of which, when the majority are
once ſenſible, they never deſiſt from defending.</p>
            <p>Numberleſs, therefore, were the diſputes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and
his parliament, during this whole reign; one attempting to keep the royal
ſplendor unſullied, the others aiming at leſſening the dangerous part
of his power; the one labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to preſerve the laws and inſtitutions of
former reigns, the other ſtedfaſt in aſſerting the inherent privileges
of mankind. Thus we ſee virtue was the cauſe of the diſſenſion on
either ſide; and the principles of both, though ſeemingly oppoſite, were,
in fact, founded either in law or in reaſon. When the parliament would not
grant a ſubſidy, James had examples enough, among his predeceſſors, to
extort a benevolence. Edward IV, Henry VIII, and others, had often done this,
and he was intitled, undoubtedly, by precedent, to the ſame privilege. The
houſe of commons, on the other hand, who began to find themſelves the
protectors of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and not the paſſive inſtruments of the crown,
juſtly conſidered that this extorted benevolence might, at length, make the
Sovereign entirely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the parliament, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
againſt it, as an infringement on their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges. Theſe attempts of the
crown, and thoſe murmurings of the people, continued through this 
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0443100201:305"/> whole reign, and firſt gave riſe to that ſpirit
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> party, which has ever ſince
ſubſiſted in England; the one ſide declaring for the King's
prerogative, the other for the people's liberty.</p>
            <p>Whenever the people, as I have already obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, get ſight of
liberty, they never quit the view: the commons, as may naturally be expected in
the preſent juncture, gained ground, even though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated; and the Monarch,
notwithſtanding his profeſſions and reſolutions to keep his prerogative
untouched, was every day loſing ſome ſmall part of his authority.
Hiſtorians are apt to charge this to his imbecillity, but it, in reality,
aroſe from the ſpirit of the times: the clergy, who had returned from
baniſhment during the laſt reign, had diſſeminated republican
principles among their hearers, and no art nor authority could check its
growth; ſo that, had the moſt active, or the moſt diligent Monarch upon
earth, been then ſeated on the throne, yet could he not have preſerved the
ancient privileges of Engliſh monarchy unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired.</p>
            <p>The clemency and the juſtice of this Monarch's reign early
appeared from that ſpirit of modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he ſhewed to the
profeſſors of each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: the minds of the people had been long
irritated againſt each other, and each party perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the reſt, as it
happened to prevail; James wiſely obſerved, that men ſhould be puniſhed
on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for actions, and not for opinions: each party murmured againſt him, and
the univerſal complaint of every ſect was the beſt argument of his
mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration towards all.</p>
            <p>Yet, mild as he was, there was a project con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, in the very
beginning of his reign, for the re-eſtabliſhment of Popery, which ſeemed
to be <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0443100201:306"/> even of infernal extraction: a more horrid, or a
more terrible ſcheme, never entered into the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind; the maſſacre of
St. Bartholomew, in France, in which ſixty thouſand Proteſtants were
murdered in cold blood, was, in reality, not ſo dreadful. The Catholics of
England had expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome condeſcenſions from the King, which he was
unwilling to grant: this refuſal determined them to take different meaſures
for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their religion and their party; they were
reſolved to cut off the King and both houſes of parliament at one blow: the
houſe, where the parliament of England ſits, is built on arched vaults, and
in theſe the Papiſts were determined to lay gun-powder, in order to blow up
the King and all the members of both houſes at their next ſitting. For this
deed of deſperation a number of perſons united, among which were Robert
Cateſby, Thomas Percy, kinſman to the Earl of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland; John Grant,
Ambroſe Rookwood, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Wright, Francis Treſham, Guy Fawkes, and
Everard Digby. How horrid ſoever the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, yet every member ſeemed
faithful and ſecret in the league, and, about two months before the ſitting
of parliament, they hired the cellar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Parliament-houſe, and bought
a quantity of coals with which it was then filled, as if for their own uſe:
the next thing done was to convey, privately, thirty-ſix barrels of
gun-powder, which had been purchaſed in Holland, and which were covered under
the coals and faggots. The day for the ſitting of the parliament approached;
never was treaſon more ſecret, or ruin more apparently inevitable: the
conſpirators expected the day with impatience, and gloried in their meditated
guilt. A remorſe of private friendſhip ſaved the kingdom, 
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0443100201:307"/> when all the ties, divine and human, were too weak to
ſave it: Sir Henry Piercy conceived a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſaving the life of the
Lord Monteagle, his inmate friend and companion. About ten days before the
ſitting, this nobleman, upon his return home, received a letter from a
perſon unknown, the meſſenger making off as ſoon as he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it: the letter was to this effect: 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Stay away from this parliament, for God and man
have concurred to puniſh the wickedneſs of the times. Think not ſlightly
of this warning, though the danger does not appear, yet they ſhall receive a
terrible blow, without knowing from whence it comes. The danger will be paſt
as ſoon as you have burnt this letter, and this counſel may do you good,
but cannot do you harm.</hi>
               </q> The contents of this myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious letter
ſurprized and puzzled the nobleman to whom it was addreſſed: he
communicated it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to the Secretary of State, and the Secretary
ſhewed it to the council; none of them were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of comprehending the
meaning of it, and it was reſolved to communicate it to the King. In this
univerſal agitation between doubt and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, the King was the
firſt who penetrated the meaning of its fatal contents; he concluded that
ſome ſudden danger was preparing, by means of gun-powder. The Lord
Chamberlain ſent proper perſons, the very night before the ſitting of
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to examine the vaults above-mentioned: there the whole train of
powder was diſcovered, and a man in a cloak and boots, with a dark lanthorn
in his hand, preparing the dreadful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; this was Guy Fawkes, who
paſſed for Piercy's ſervant. The atrociouſneſs of his guilt
inſpired him with reſolution; and, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted air he told them,
that had he blown them and himſelf up together, he had been happy. He 
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0443100201:308"/> obſtinately refuſed to name his accomplices; the
ſight of the rack, however, at length brought him to a confeſſion. No
nation fears death leſs than the Engliſh, but none dread torments more.</p>
            <p>The conſpirators, who had prepared all things to ſecond the mine
at Weſtminſter, finding their plot diſcovered, fled different ways to
aſſemble their Catholic friends, whom they expected to riſe in their
defence: but, the country being every-where alarmed againſt them, they were
at laſt forced, to the number of about an hundred, to ſtop at an houſe in
Warwickſhire, where they were reſolved to ſell their lives dearly. A
ſpark of fire happening to fall among ſome gun-powder that was laid to dry,
it blew up, and ſo maimed the principal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, that the ſurvivors
reſolved to open the gate and ſally through the multitude that
ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the houſe. Some inſtantly were ſlain with a thouſand
wounds; Cateſby, Piercy, and Winter, ſtanding back to back, fought long and
deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, till, in the end, the two firſt fell covered with blood, and
the other was taken alive. Such as ſurvived the ſlaughter were tried and
convicted; ſeveral fell juſt victims to juſtice, and others expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
the King's mercy. Two Jeſuits, Garnet and Oldcorn, who were privy to the
plot, ſuffered with the reſt: the King maintained, that they were
puniſhed juſtly; but, by their own party, they were regarded as martyrs to
religion, tho' without ground, for James was too humane to condemn any upon
ſuch ſlight motives, as thoſe of opinion.</p>
            <p>The diſcovery and extinction of this conſpiracy, which was
entirely owing to the wiſdom of the King, gained him the love of his
ſubjects, though it had but little influence over his parliament, in 
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0443100201:309"/> extoring ſupplies. His deſire of peace with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
ſtates diminiſhed his authority at home; for, though he talked boldly of
his prerogative in parliament, yet, unlike ſome of his predeceſſors, he
had no ſtanding army to back his pretenſions: his ſpeeches, which were
rather arguments in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of royal authority than directions or advice, only
put both houſes upon arguing with him in his own way, but not upon complying
with his requeſts; and they refuſed him ſupplies, when they knew it could
be done with impunity. His libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and his indigence often forced him to
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſions, which, when once granted, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be again recalled;
thus, while he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf enlarging the royal prerogative, he was, in
reality, abridging it on every ſide.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the oppoſition this King met with from his parliament, was
the motive of his encouraging favourites, who might help him to reduce them to
his meaſures: his firſt choice was fixed upon Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Carr, who, from a
private gentleman, was brought up, through all the gradations of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
till created Earl of Somerſet. An amour between this gentleman and the
Counteſs of Eſſex, one of the lewdeſt, yet fineſt, women of her time,
at laſt terminated in his diſgrace: his friend, Sir Thomas Overbury, had
declared againſt his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rving this lady, who was eſpouſed to another:
this advice procured the reſentment of Somerſet, and the hatred of the
Counteſs. The King, by falſe pretences, was inſtigated to confine Sir
Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas in the Tower, and here the Earl and the Counteſs cauſed him to be
poiſoned. When this tranſaction came to the King's knowledge, he delivered
him to public juſtice, by which he was <pb n="307" facs="tcp:0443100201:310"/> condemned; but
he received the royal pardon, tho' he ever after continued in diſgrace.</p>
            <p>His next, and greateſt favourite, was George Villars, afterwards
Duke of Buckingham, whoſe perſon and beauty firſt drew the King's
attention and regard. This nobleman was the firſt who was ever created a Duke
in England, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allied to the royal family: it may be reckoned among
the moſt capricious circumſtances of this reign, that a King, who was bred
a ſcholar, ſhould chuſe, for his favourites, the moſt illiterate of his
courtiers; that he, who trembled at a drawn ſword, ſhould laviſh favours
on one who promiſed to be the hero of a romance. Buckingham firſt
inſpired young Prince Charles, who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards famous for his misfortunes
and death, with a deſire of going diſguiſed into Spain, to court the
Infanta: their adventures in this romantic expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could fill novels, and
have actually been made the ſubject of many. Charles was the knight-errant,
and Buckingham ſerved under him as 'ſquire: they ſet out poſt, and
travelled through France under the names of Jack and Tom Smith; they appeared
at Paris in large buſhy perriwigs, which ſhadowed their faces. They were
received in Spain with all poſſible reſpect, but Buckingham filled the
whole court with intrigues, adventures, ſerenades, and jealouſy. To make
the folly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, he fell in love with the Ducheſs of Oliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez, the prime
miniſter's wife, and inſulted the prime miniſter. Theſe levities were
not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured at ſuch a court as that of Spain, where jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy is
ſo prevalent, and decorum ſo neceſſary; the match was broke off, and
the Prince was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to return in ſafety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:0443100201:311"/> A match for this Prince was ſoon after
nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated with Henrietta, the daughter of Henry IV. of France, and this met
with better ſucceſs than the former: Charles had ſeen this Princeſs,
when he paſſed through that kingdom in diſguiſe; he admired her beauty,
and from every quarter was informed of her ſenfe and diſcretion. A
diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was got from the Pope for her marrying a Proteſtant Prince,
but King James died before the conſummation of the nuptials.</p>
            <p>Were we to take the character of this Monarch as deſcribed by
Rapin, we ſhould conſider him as one of the worſt of Princes, even while
he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to defend him. It is this injudicious hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian's method,
wherever he finds a good character among our Kings, to load it with reproach;
wherever he meets a bad one, to extenuate its guilt, ſo that every Monarch is
levelled by him to one common ſtandard of indifference. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon
particular facts are ſimilar to his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters: whatever other hiſtorians
have laid down as motives, he undertakes to contradict, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that he
thus acquires an air of impartiality. In the preſent inſtance, he
ſtrongly inſinuates throughout, that James was a Papiſt, with no better
proofs than his being ever a favourer of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration: he had but juſt before
blamed Mary, and with reaſon, for her implacable partiality, yet he condemns
James only becauſe he was impartial. To this Monarch the Engliſh are
indebted for that noble freedom of opinion they have ſince enjoyed; a
benefit, of which narrow-minded bigots have too often ſtrove to deprive
them.</p>
            <p>With regard to foreign negotiations, James nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtood nor
cultivated them; and perhaps, in the government of ſuch a kingdom as England,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0443100201:312"/> domeſtic politics alone are requiſite. His reign was
marked with none of the ſplendors of triumph, nor no new conqueſts or
acquiſitions; but the arts were nevertheleſs ſilently and happily going
on to improvement: reaſon was extending its influence, and ſhewing mankind
a thouſand errors in religion and government, that had been rivetted by long
preſcription. People now no longer joined to ſome popular leader, but each
began to think for himſelf: the reformation had introduced a ſpirit of
liberty, even while the conſtitution and the laws were built upon arbitrary
power. James taught them, by his own example, to argue upon theſe topics; he
ſet up the divine authority of Kings againſt the natural privileges of the
people: the ſubject began in controverſy, and it was ſoon found that the
Monarch's was the weakeſt ſide.</p>
