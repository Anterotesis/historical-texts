            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE Happineſs of Mankind depends viſibly on their living in Society, and of Courſe under Subjection to Laws; of which, the ſhorteſt and the cleareſt Proof is this, that Men are alike miſerable, under the two extremes of Tyranny and Anarchy; both of which are Privations of Law, and conſequently of Government. The Operation of Laws, with reſpect to the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Society, depends upon their Execution, and this infers the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Magiſtrates, who, in all Monarchies, derive their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the ſupreme Magiſtrate; whence the King is, with equal Truth and Propriety, ſaid to be the Fountain of Juſtice as well as of Honour. The Nature of Offices has been always declared to the People by exterior Signs, and hence the Cuſtom of inveſting Superior, and more eſpecially the Supreme Magiſtrate, with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Solemnity, at his Entrance upon Government, which, tho' with very different Forms, has yet, in ſome Form or other, been practiſed in every civilized Nation.</p>
            <p>There can be no Doubt, that the Ceremony of Anointing was borrowed from the Scriptures; and the <hi>Jews</hi> tell us, that all their Kings were anointed, from <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Hircanus.</hi> It paſſed from the <hi>Jews</hi> to other Nations, and ſeems to have been practiſed here ſoon after the Introduction of Chriſtianity. The Monks indeed, would willingly perſuade us, that <hi>Alfred the Great,</hi> was the firſt anointed King, and that he received his Unction from the Pope at <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0340300900:4"/>
which may be true, in reſpect to the Unction; but then, as <hi>Alfred</hi> was a Child of five Years old, it is much more likely, that it was the Chriſm or Unction uſed in the Ceremony of Confirmation, than the Regal Unction. It appears from <hi>Gildas,</hi> the moſt ancient Writer of our own Nation, that is yet extant, that the Britiſh Kings were anointed; and this Practice was ſo conſtant, that the common Phraſe in the old Chronicles, to expreſs the Acceſſion of a Prince to the Government, is this, that at ſuch a Time, he was anointed King. We have therefore uſed this Ceremony as early, if not ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, than any other Nation in Europe, as, if it was neceſſary, might be very eaſily ſhewn.</p>
            <p>The Uſe of Crowns alſo is very ancient; and, in Proceſs of Time, grew to be of very different Forms. The Diadem was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally of Cloth, and bound about the Head like a Fillet. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Circle of Gold was in Uſe, ſome times plain, as was the ancient Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſometimes adorned with Spires or Rays. The <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings uſed both. The former being called King's-Band, and the latter King's-Helm, as being worn upon a Helmet. In latter Times, it was alſo worn without the Helm, as well as with it, as appears in the Coins of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings. Other Ornaments were gradually added, ſuch as the Flower-de-Lis. At length the Emperor wore a Crown with Bars, riſing from the Sides, and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Top, thence ſtiled a Crown Imperial. Authors are not agreed, when this was firſt introduced into <hi>England,</hi> ſome ſay by <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> III. on his being made Vicar General of the Empire, by <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> others by <hi>Henry</hi> V. Be that as it will, if an Imperial Crown is the Mark of Independent Sovereignty, then, no Doubt, our Kings have a Right to wear it, as well as thoſe of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſo they have long worn it.</p>
            <p>There was not any thing, in which our <hi>Saxon</hi> Anceſtors were more curious and exact, than in their Religious Ceremonies; and therefore we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, they were particularly ſo in the Inauguration; or, as their own emphatic Term was, in the hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Kings. This we find frequently mentioned, in that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic Hiſtory, ſtiled the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle. This Solemnity, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was not confined anciently to any particular Place; for, amongſt
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0340300900:5"/>
other Princes, <hi>Alfred,</hi> juſtly ſurnamed <hi>the Great,</hi> was crowned at <hi>Wincheſter, Ethelſtan,</hi> at <hi>Bath,</hi> where, as that Hiſtory tells us, there were mighty Rejoicings, and a great Reſort of the Clergy and Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon the Occaſion. But both in earlier and later Times than theſe, ſeveral of our Kings were crowned at <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> which from thence received its Name, and is therefore ſtiled in <hi>Latin, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giodunum</hi> by <hi>Leland,</hi> who thinks that at ſuch Times a Theatre was erected, that the whole Ceremony might be more conſpicuous to the People. But <hi>Edward the Confeſſor</hi> was crowned at <hi>Wincheſter;</hi> and it is particularly mentioned in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived many grave Exhortations from the Archbiſhop, in relation to the Duties of his high Office. <hi>Harold</hi> was crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> founded and ſcarce finiſhed by King <hi>Edward,</hi> and as that Chronicle ſays, by the Appointment of his Predeceſſor, and by the Election of the People. In Reſpect to the Confeſſor's Memory, the Abbey of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> became in ſucceeding Times, the uſual Place of our Monarch's Coronation, more eſpecially as the <hi>Regalia</hi> of that King were kept there.</p>
            <p>In our old Hiſtorians there are no Traces of the Ceremony, which is not to be wondered at, conſidering the Brevity of thoſe Annals; but in the Leidger books, and other Abbey Records, many Fragments are to be met with, of moſt of the Eccleſiaſtical Ceremonies, and amongſt others of the Coronations of ſome of theſe Kings, from which it plainly appears, that the Forms in uſe after the Conqueſt, and even the modern Forms, were borrowed from theſe; and this very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably would be ſtill more evident, if we had any <hi>Saxon</hi> Ceremonial compleat. As it is, we ſee plainly that the different Prayers at the Unction, Crowning, putting the Sword, the Sceptre, and the Ball into the King's Hands, were taken from them; and, if we conſider the Reverence ever paid to Antiquity, more eſpecially in Matters of this Kind, it will not certainly appear ſtrange.</p>
            <p>After what has been related, it may ſeem a little ſurpriſing that ſome of our ableſt Antiquaries have complained, that they could meet with no ſettled or authentic Form of the Coronation of our Monarchs. But a little Conſideration will ſhew us, that we may eaſily account for this, in a manner very conſiſtent with what has been
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0340300900:6"/>
already ſaid. While our Anceſtors continued Papiſts the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſtill remained in <hi>Latin,</hi> tho' it may be not without Additions and Alterations. But after the Reformation farther Changes became neceſſary, as we find by the very imperfect Accounts yet remaining of the Coronation of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. in which his Oath, and no doubt, ſome other Parts were in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they might be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the People. In Proceſs of Time, ſeveral of the Prayers and Collets grew obſolete and uncouth in their Language, which therefore rendered it requiſite to review and retouch them, in order to accommodate the Service to the Language of the Times in which it was performed. When therefore Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> was accuſed of altering the Coronation Service, at the Inauguration of <hi>Charles</hi> I. he pleaded the abſolute Neceſſity of this; he ſaid, that the Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Emendations, which were made in ſome Parts of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, were partly to render the Senſe clear, and partly to make it proper in grammatical <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which, he ſaid, was done by Royal Authority, in a Committee for that Purpoſe; but that no material or eſſential Alterations were made, and that the King's Coronation Oath particularly remained untouched, and was the ſame with his Father's, which was ſettled by that pious and worthy Prelate, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Whitgift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, it may be truly affirmed, that the Bulk and Subſtance of the Coronation Ceremony is the very ſame at this day, as it was above a thouſand Years ago; and if any thing has been retrenched, it has been owing to ſuperſtitious Circumſtances, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced on the ancient and venerable Form, which the <hi>Saxons</hi> had in uſe, and to which, even after the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, the Nation in general were ſo much attached, that it was thought expedient to preſerve it; though afterwards, when the Knowledge of this Form came to be loſt with the People, the Clergy might poſſibly intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Expreſſions more favourable to their own Power, and more ſuitable to thoſe Notions they were deſirous ſhould prevail. But theſe again, as we have before obſerved, were at the Reformation curtailed or taken away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0340300900:7"/>
As to the Pieces that are here preſented to our Readers View, they are ſuch as may contribute to give them a tolerable Idea of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of a King and Queen. It was in this View, that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the Coronation of <hi>Charles</hi> II. was ſelected, as being in moſt Reſpects preferable to that of his Brother, which has been ſo pomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſplayed by Mr. <hi>Sandford,</hi> whoſe Knowledge and Diligence we by no means would depreciate; and the Aſſiſtance that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived hath enabled him to render it a truly valuable Work, ſo that it has been, and will be juſtly regarded as the fitteſt Model for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ceremonies of that Kind. King <hi>Charles</hi> II. was not married at the Time of his Coronation, and therefore we have annexed the Ceremony of the Coronation of King <hi>James</hi>'s Queen, <hi>Mary,</hi> which will be found exactly agreeable to that of <hi>Sandford,</hi> with the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prayers, which, as well known at that Time, are, to ſhorten his Account, introduced with only a Line or two, and the Remainder dropt by an &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As to the Notes, they relate to Perſons and Things; with reſpect to the former, the Reader will find what in the Peruſal of ſuch Pieces it is very natural to deſire, the Names of thoſe Prelates who aſſiſted at thoſe Ceremonies, which, as needleſs at that Juncture, were left out when they were originally publiſhed. In regard to the latter, they are calculated to explain the ſeveral Parts of the <hi>Regalia,</hi> and other Paſſages that ſeem to require Elucidation, that the whole might be as plain and perſpicuous as poſſible. There is a Pleaſure in reviewing the Pomp of paſt Triumphs, in recalling to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance thoſe great Perſonages, who are long ago removed from our View, but whom the Fame of their Actions ſtill renders worthy of our Notice. The whole ſtands now in ſuch a Point of Light, as that the Ceremonies of theſe Coronations may be as clearly and as fully conceived, as if we had been preſent at them; and as far as could be judged, Care has been taken to anſwer every Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that a judicious and inquiſitive Peruſer would naturally aſk in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through them, the Omiſſion of which ſo frequently and ſo greatly perplexes Relations of this Kind, and renders them more apt to raiſe than to ſatisfy our Curioſity.</p>

As to the Appendix, it is compoſed of Pieces not commonly known, or eaſy to be found, as being either involved in large Works, where few would take the Pains to ſeek them, or hid in the Cloſets of Antiquaries, where it would have been no eaſy Matter to find them. The Account particularly of the Manner in which our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Regalia</hi> was loſt, and in what it conſiſted, has ſo near a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Subject, and contributes ſo much to ſet it in a clearer Light, that it muſt be allowed to deſerve a Place in ſuch a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; as does alſo the Order of the ſolemn Cavalcade from the <hi>Tower</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which our Anceſtors eſteemed no inconſiderable Part of the Ceremony. Theſe are likewiſe illuſtrated with ſuch Notes as appeared neceſſary to explain them, and it is hoped, that the whole taken together will be found no unpleaſing, unentertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or uninſtructive Miſcellany on the Subject of Coronations, which being the general Topic of Converſation at preſent occaſioned their Publication, and as this has been attended with no ſmall Degree of Haſte, they are ſubmitted to the Candour of the Public.</p>

The bottom Board nine Inches from the Ground is ſupported at the four Corners by as many Lions, and between the Seat and this bottom Board is incloſed that Stone, which Hector Boethius calls <hi>Fatale Marmor.</hi> The Legend concerning it is this, that it is the very Stone on which the Patriarch Jacob repoſed his Head in the Plain of Luz. It is of a bluiſh Colour, mixed with ſome Veins of red, of an oblong Form, twenty two Inches long, thirteen broad, and eleven deep. It was brought to Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantia in the Province of Galicia in Spain, by Gathel King of Scots, who uſed it as his Throne. Tranſported from thence into Ireland by Simon Brech the firſt King of Scotland, who ruled there about Seven Hundred Years before Chrift. Three Hundred and Twenty Years after this, King Fergus removed it into Scotland, where, Anno Domini 859, it was placed in the Abby of Scoon by King Kenneth, who cauſed it to be incloſed in this Wooden Chair with this Diſtich:

               <p>While this was doing, the <hi>Chair,</hi> that was before placed at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Stage, was removed and ſet on the <hi>North</hi> Side of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> between it and <hi>St. Edward's Chair;</hi> whereunto the KING came, ſat down, and was anointed by the ſaid Archbiſhop, while the <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> held the AMPULLA<note n="z" place="bottom">The Ampulla is in the Form of an Eagle, with Wings expanded ſtanding on a Pedeſtal, all of pure Gold, weighing about ten Ounces. The Eagle being hollow, unſcrews in the Middle of the Neck, for the more eaſy putting in the Oil, which, when the King is anointed, is poured through the Beak. The French have an Ampulla, which is ſaid to have been brought from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by a white Dove, and which is kept in the Abby of S Remi, from whence it is brought in great Ceremony when the moſt Chriſtian King is crowned at Rheims In regard to this, our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Anceſtors were not behind; for the Reader may find, in Thomas Walſingham, that the Bleſſed Virgin gave to Thomas Becket, Archbiſhop of Canterbury, being then in Exile, a Holy Eagle full of Oil in a Stone Veſſel, which he depoſited in a Monaſtery at Poitiers. There, in the Reign of Edward III Henry I. Duke of Lancaſter received it from a holy Man, who found it by a ſecond Revelation. The Duke gave it to the Black Prince, who placed it in a ſtrong Cheſt in the Tower, where his Son Richard the Second, ſearching for his Father's Jewels, met with it, and preſſed the Archbiſhop of Canterbury to anoint him therewith; but the Archbiſhop told him, he had been once anointed, and that this Royal Unction could not be repeated. The King carried it over to Ireland, and at his Return from thence gave it to the Archbiſhop, who therewith anointed Henry the Fourth. In <hi>Sandford's Hiſtory of the Coronation of James the Second,</hi> we are told, the Oil for that Monarch's Coronation was prepared by his Order, by James St. Amand, Eſq. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary to that Prince, and which was ſolemnly conſecrated the Morning of the Coronation by the Dean of Weſtminſter, aſſiſted by the Prebendaries. It was ſo exceeding rich and fragrant, and ſo highly approved of by the King and Queen, that he had two hundred Pounds paid him for it by the Treaſurer of the Houſehold, in Conſequence of a Warrant from the Lord Chamberlain.</note> and poured the <hi>Oil</hi> into the

Finally, let him be bleſſed with Children, that may reign as Kings after Him, and rule this Kingdom by Succeſſion of all Ages; and after the glorious and happy Days of this preſent Life, give him, of thy Mercy, an everlaſting Kingdom with thee in Heaven, through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Lord.

               <p>But, towards the End of the Creed, he again took his Crown from the Lord Great Chamberlain, and put it on his Head, as alſo the Scepter with the Croſs from Mr. <hi>Howard,</hi> and that with the Dove, from the Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> and prepared for his Deſcent from his Throne, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Altar,</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> the <hi>Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as ſoon as the ſinging of the <hi>Creed</hi> was fully ended, the KING deſcended with the <hi>Crown</hi> on his <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Scepters</hi> in both <hi>Hands,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> ſupporting him, with the four Swords naked before, and all the great Officers of State attending.</p>

               <p>Here the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> retired from the Ceremonies into <hi>St. Edward's</hi> Chapel, and thence went home, leaving the Remainder of his Duty to be performed by the Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi>

Grant this, O LORD, for JESUS CHRIST'S ſake, our only Mediator and Advocate. AMEN.</q>

                  <q>Almighty GOD, give thee of the Dew of Heaven, and of the Fat of the Earth, and abundance of Corn and Wine. Let the Nations ſerve thee, and the Tribes worſhip thee, and let him be bleſſed that bleſſeth thee; and GOD ſhall be thy Helper. Almighty GOD, bleſs you with the Bleſſing of Heaven above, in the Mountains and Hills, and with the Bleſſings of the Earth beneath; with the Bleſſings of Corn, and Wine, and Fruit, and let the Bleſſings of the Fathers, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> be eſtabliſhed upon thee, through JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST our <hi>Lord. Amen.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And next <hi>pronounced</hi> this <hi>Bleſſing:</hi>
                  <q>Bleſs, O LORD, the virtuous Carriage of this KING, and accept the Work of his Hands; repleniſh his Realm with the Bleſſings of Heaven, of the Dew of the Water, and of the Deeps. Let the Influence of the Sun and Moon drop down Fatneſs upon the high Mountains, and the Clouds rain Plenty on the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that the Earth may abound with all Things. Let the Bleſſings of him, that appeared in the Buſh, deſcend upon his Head; and the Fulneſs of his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings fall on his Children and Poſterity. Let his Feet be dipped in Oil, and his Horn exalted, as the Horn of an Unicorn; with which he may ſcatter his Enemies from off the Face of the Earth. The Lord that ſitteth in Heaven be his Defender, for ever and ever, through JESUS CHRIST our LORD. AMEN.</q>

               <p>When he came thither, he put off his <hi>Crown,</hi> and delivered it to the Lord Great Chamberlain; the <hi>Scepter</hi> with the <hi>Croſs,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Howard;</hi> and that with the <hi>Dove,</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Albemarle.</hi>

               <p>Where being arrived, he took off <hi>St. Edward's Crown,</hi> and delivered it to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who immediately laid it upon <hi>St. Edward's Altar;</hi> all the reſt of the <hi>Regalia</hi> were given into the Hands of the Dean of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> and laid there alſo.</p>

               </p>
               <p>After this the KING was arrayed in his <hi>Purple Robes,</hi> and then came near to <hi>St. Edward's Altar,</hi> where the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> ſtood ready with the <hi>Imperial Crown</hi> in his Hands, and ſet it upon the <hi>King's Head,</hi> upon which the KING took the <hi>Scepter</hi> with the <hi>Croſs</hi> in his <hi>right Hand,</hi> and the <hi>Globe</hi> in his <hi>left,</hi> and immediately the <hi>Proceeding</hi> began thence into <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>

The Kings of Arms marched likewiſe with their Crowns on.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Proceeding</hi> being entered into <hi>Weſtminſter Hall,</hi> the Nobility, and others who had Tables aſſigned them, went and placed themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at; but the KING, attended by the Great Officers, withdrew into the inner Court of Wards for half an Hour. In the mean Time, all the Tables in the Hall were ſerved, before the <hi>King's</hi> Service came up, and were placed in this Manner:</p>
               <p>On the right Hand of the King's Throne, below in the Hall, were ſet two Tables, one beneath the other. At the upper End of the firſt, next the State, which had two Side Tables to ſerve it, ſat the Biſhops, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them the Judges with the reſt of the Long Robe.</p>
               <p>At the ſecond Table, which had two Side Board Tables likewiſe, to ſerve it, ſat the Maſters in Chancery, and the Six Clerks.</p>
               <p>And here at this Table were the Barons of the Cinque Ports obliged to ſit, through a Diſturbance that happened, with which it is not neceſſary to trouble the Reader, although the upper End of the firſt Table was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for them.</p>
               <p>Upon the left Hand of the King's Throne, below on the other Side of the Hall, was placed a long Table, whereat the Nobility dined, and this Table had four Side Tables to ſerve it.</p>
               <p>And behind this, cloſe to the Wall, at a ſhorter Table, ſat the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, Recorder, and twelve Chief Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> who had alſo two Side Tables to ſerve them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, was a Table, with one Side Table to ſerve it, ſet for the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Arms, whereat they alſo dined. Each Table was furniſhed with three Courſes, anſwerable to that of the King's, beſides the Deſert.</p>
               <p>A little before the KING returned to Dinner, two Eſquires of the Body<note n="p" place="bottom">This was a very honourable Office in the King's Houſehold, and of theſe there were anciently four, who, in their Turns, attended in the Day Time near the Perſon of the King, and in the Night near his Bed-chamber.</note>, <hi>viz.

               <p>On the right Side of the Throne was erected a Gallery for the Kings of Arms, Heralds, and Purſuivants, and oppoſite thereto, another for the Muſic, and below ſtood the King's Trumpeters.</p>

This ſingular Regard ſhewed itſelf manifeſtly in the Cavalcade from the Tower to Weſtminſter at her Coronation, May 19, 1553. This no doubt influenced them in their Conduct on Elizabeth's Coronation, which however was far leſs ſplendid and coſtly.</note>; at <hi>Cheapſide</hi> Conduir, ſhe was preſented with a BIBLE<note n="c" place="bottom">At this Conduit, was a Cave, out of which came a Perſon with grey Hairs, bald behind, with his Glaſs and Scythe repreſenting TIME, followed by a Woman who was arrayed all in white as Painters depict TRUTH, to her the old Man delivered a Book, which from her was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Queen by one of her Attendants.
