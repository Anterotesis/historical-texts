            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE State of the Exciſe After the UNION, compar'd with what it is now.</head>
            <p>THE burden of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Taxes, induſtriouſly buzzed about into the Ears of the Commonalty, by ſuch as upon other Views were prejudiced againſt the preſent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Union, has no doubt contributed in a great meaſure, to work them into ſo general a ferment againſt it. Their weakneſs and incapacity to inquire into, and examine theſe Matters, joined with ſome mean prejudices from the fear of loſing the Crown and the like, made them a ſubject ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſy to be wrought upon this way.</p>
            <p>That the Deſign might have the better Succeſs, all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods have been uſed, to ſcrue up theſe Burdens to extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant heights, that their appearance might be more fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. It cannot be denied that in an Affair of this moment, to ſet Matters in their due light, was the duty of every Perſon that ventured to give the Publick his Opinion; but to fiſh for ways to magnify things, ſeems to have had ſome other End than the real Service of the Nation.</p>
            <p>To give a fair and diſtinct view, and to rectify Miſtakes as to theſe on Liquors, is the deſign of the following Sheet. For underſtanding of which, the Reader is deſired to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the following Particulars.</p>

            <p>FRom theſe two Views of the greater and leſſer Exciſe, It not only appears that the greater is no ſuch hideous monſter, as is commonly believed; but alſo that taking both Jointly we ſhould be full as eaſy as now, eſpecially with regard to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1213502700:8"/>
the Poorer ſort of People. Nay further, we ſhould be much eaſier, than we have been for ſeveral Years ſince the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. For from the 1ſt of <hi>June</hi> 1693, to the 1ſt of <hi>May</hi> 1695, our Exciſe was 2 <hi>Merks per</hi> Boll, and 3 <hi>Pennies per</hi> Pint, in all 6 <hi>Pennies per</hi> Pint, only half a <hi>Penny</hi> leſs than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> greater Exciſe. And from 1ſt of <hi>September</hi> 1695, to <hi>March</hi> 1697 5 <hi>Pennies per</hi> Pint, from thence to <hi>March</hi> 1698, 4 <hi>Pennies,</hi> and from thence to <hi>March</hi> 99, 6 <hi>Pennies</hi>; So that for a Tract of 6 Years, we were under an Exciſe near equal to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in quantity, but vaſtly more burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, as will appear by the following two Conſiderations, 1<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi> That the 4 Dear Years were part of theſe ſix, which conſidering the circumſtance of the Poor were hard enough under any Exciſe; but this is only a temporary Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the next is perpetual, <hi>viz.</hi> That we neither had then, nor have now, any diſtinction betwixt Small and Strong Ale; The conſequence of which, was that the Brewers find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Ale equal as to Exciſe, choſe rather to Brew Strong Ale, which would yield them ſix <hi>Pennies</hi> profite <hi>per</hi> Pint, than ſmall which yielded only two <hi>Pennies,</hi> yet Payed the ſame Exciſe; and accordingly the Ale commonly Sold then was 3 <hi>Pence per</hi> Pint, or 2 <hi>Pence</hi> and a Plack, which the poor People behooved either to Buy or Drink Water. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſhould the Brewers Brew ſtrong Ale under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Exciſe, yet there will ſtill be good wholſom Drink for the poorer ſort at an eaſie Rate, by reaſon of the diſtinction of the Exciſe.</p>
            <p>If what is here advanced be true, as there is little reaſon to doubt, ſince it depends on Uncontraverted matters of fact, and a Plain and ſimple calcul: It may ſeem odd, that the Author of the <hi>Short View of our preſent Trade and Taxes,</hi> Page 4. Should ſuppoſe each Boll of Malt will produce 6. <hi>ſh.</hi>

               <hi>ſterl.</hi> Exciſe, and ſhould on this build his calcul of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Exciſe in caſe of the Union. No doubt, a Brewer for a Wager may produce near 8 <hi>ſh.</hi> Exciſe from a Boll, by Brewing Ale at 10 <hi>pennies per</hi> Pint true value; but he's a Mad Man if he does ſo for ordinary, ſince had he Brewed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> at 9 <hi>pennies,</hi> the Exciſe would only be near 2 <hi>ſh.</hi> 8 <hi>d. ſterl.</hi> and ſince we are ſuppoſing, I ſhall ſuppoſe and make good, that a Brewer may bring the Exciſe of a Boll of Malt to 17 <hi>ſh.</hi> and 4 <hi>d. Scots,</hi> by Brewing only 4. Gallons of very ſtrong Ale from it, which at 4 <hi>ſh.</hi> 4 <hi>d. Scots per</hi> Gallon makes the fore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaid Sum.
