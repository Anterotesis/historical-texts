            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THE firſt part of the following Remarks on the uſes of the definitive article in the Greek Text of the New Teſtament was printed in the ſecond Faſciculus of the Muſeum Oxonienſe. A Supplement to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks was at the ſame time promiſed to be publiſhed in the third Faſciculus of the Muſeum. But as many learned friends concurred with the Editor in thinking that the Remarks contain a very valuable acceſſion to the evidences of Chriſt's divinity, he was unwilling to detain the Supplement, which exemplifies the Rules of the Remarks, any longer from the publick, and has there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prevailed on Mr Sharp to permit him to publiſh it with the Remarks. He earneſtly recommends them both to Mr Wakefield's moſt deliberate conſideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To Mr Sharp's Remarks and Supplement he has ſubjoined a plain hiſtorical proof of the divinity of Chriſt founded on</hi> Chriſt's own teſtimony of himſelf atteſted and interpreted by his living witneſſes and enemies,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0724900300:5"/>the Jews,—<hi>on</hi> the evidence of his trial and crucifix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, <hi>and on</hi> the moſt explicit declarations of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles after the Reſurrection of Chriſt. <hi>What ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him to be a ſubſtantial and unanſwerable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, he has, in this little exerciſe on the ſubject, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to render an eaſy and popular proof, of our Saviour's divinity. It was printed ſeparately for the uſe of the unlearned part of his pariſhioners, and is ſubjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this treatiſe for the convenience of other unlearned readers, and ſuch as may not have much conſidered the ſubject.</hi>

               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I look upon the date of your laſt oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing letter, I am much aſhamed that I have ſo long neglected to acknowledge the receipt of it. The truth is, I began a letter a few days afterwards; but recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting that I had written on the ſame ſubject (viz. the uſe of the Greek article <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and copulative <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) to a very learned friend, at a great diſtance in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I was willing to wait for his anſwer, leſt it ſhould oblige me to make any alterations in my rules; and ſo, indeed, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> proved; for he objected to my firſt rule (as it was then ſtated) and has cited ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions to it, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thought ſufficient to ſet it entirely aſide: but this, I am convinced, is going too far, and would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> injury to truth. The uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0724900300:9"/>which I have made of my friend's objections, has been, to correct my rule, and add to it ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations as might include the ſeveral exceptions, cited by my learned friend, as well as others, that are ſimilar to them.</p>
            <p>The waiting for my friend's anſwer and the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary corrections in conſequence of it, together with a variety of other engagements, has prevented me from complying with your requeſt ſo ſoon as I could have wiſhed; but I ſhall now ſubmit to your conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and candour, the rules in queſtion; and beg that you will be pleaſed to favour me with whatever examples may occur in the courſe of your reading, either as exceptions to invalidate the <hi>firſt rule,</hi> or as proofs to eſtabliſh and confirm it. The reaſons of my recommending the firſt rule more particularly to your attention, is, becauſe it is of much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence than any of the reſt, as it will enable us (if the truth of it be admitted) to correct the tranſlation of ſeveral important texts in the preſent Engliſh ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the New Teſtament, in favour of a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal article of our church, which has, of late, been much oppoſed and traduced, I mean the belief that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is truly God.</p>

               <p>This, in the common engliſh verſion, is render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (very erroneouſly) as if two diſtinct perſons were mentioned, viz. <hi>"according to the grace of our God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt."</hi> But if two diſtinct perſons had really been intended to be expreſſed as (by innumerable examples of the grammatical conſtruction of ſentences for the accurate diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſons peculiar to the greek tongue, uſed in the greek teſtament, from which the preceeding rules were formed) may be demonſtrated, the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle would have been repeated (according to the ſixth rule) after the copulative and before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſubſtantive <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For it is manifeſt that the

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is a modern interpolation; becauſe the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of breaking ſentences into ſmall diviſions or particles by commas, to preſerve the neceſſary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions, was not anciently uſed (nor likely to have been uſed) by the ancient writers of the greek tongue, who were accuſtomed to much more accurate diſtinctions in their various pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar modes of grammatical expreſſion, ſpecified in the ſix preceding rules.</p>
               <p>Whole ſentences are, indeed, diſtinguiſhed in the oldeſt greek MSS. by a ſingle point placed at their end, ſometimes towards the top of the line, ſometimes in the middle, and ſometimes towards the bottom; but apparently no diſtinction of <hi>time</hi> has been intended by any of theſe three different modes of placing the point, for they are all placed indiſcriminately to the moſt obvious and full ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of ſentences; and therefore we may be aſſured that, in all theſe three different modes of placing them, they were originally intended only as <hi>periods</hi> to conclude the ſentences; ſo that when we find them in the place of commas, to diſtinguiſh merely the parts or particles of a ſentence, there is great reaſon to ſuſpect that they have been the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of later times.</p>
               <p>In the Alexandrian MS. the text before us is awkwardly divided by one of theſe points, placed after the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which point, for the reaſon
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0724900300:33"/>before given, muſt neceſſarily be deemed a <hi>period,</hi> and which did not exiſt in the original text of the ſacred penman.</p>
               <p>The intention of the tranſcriber or interpolator by adding this point to the text (for it cannot juſtly be attributed to the original writer) has been probably to make a diſtinction of perſons; as if <hi>two</hi> perſons had been named in the text inſtead of <hi>one,</hi> in like manner as the comma is added after the word God, in the engliſh verſion, <hi>without any authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the neceſſary grammatical conſtruction of the whole ſentence taken together detects the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpolator, and demonſtrates the abſurdity of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, that any ſuch point ever exiſted in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal text, becauſe the words, which are ſevered by the ſuppoſititious period, cannot form a grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſentence (according to the ordinary modes of expreſſion uſed in the greek tongue) by themſelves alone; ſo that the obvious ſenſe of the context demonſtrates their neceſſary connection with the preceding words <hi>in one entire ſentence;</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates alſo, at the ſame time, the ignorance and fallacy of the interpolator, who attempted to make two ſentences of it by inſerting a full period.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>I therefore took the firſt opportunity, afterwards, of going once more to examine the MS. and on a more cloſe inſpection, I perceived, indeed, the <hi>feint</hi> mark which occaſioned Dr Woide's inſertion of the period, in his edition; but being afterwards aſſiſted by the worthy librarian the Rev.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0724900300:42"/>and alſo, concerning the more accurate modes of Grammatical diſtinction in the greek tongue, which rendered the ſmalier points, or <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of time</hi> (ſuch as ſemicolons and commas) abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unneceſſary in the <hi>greek ſcripture;</hi> and, in addition thereto, let him obſerve, particularly on the text before us, that a point in that place, after <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> (in the middle of the ſentence, between the accuſative noun and verb) is utterly inconſutent with grammar and common ſenſe; and though the word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>A. He was called JESUS, a Saviour, the Son of God, the Son of the Higheſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Who was the mother of Jeſus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The Virgin Mary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Was any propheſy fulfilled by the birth of Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes: "all this was done, that it might be fulfilled, which was ſpoken of the Lord by the prophet, ſaying, behold, a virgin ſhall be with child, and ſhall bring forth a Son, and they ſhall call his name EMMANUEL, which being interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is GOD WITH US." (Matt. i. 22, 23. Iſaiah vii. 14.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. What was Chriſt put to death for?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. For blaſphemy, as the Jews thought it, in calling himſelf the Son of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. In what did the Jews ſay the blaſphemy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. In this, that he being, as they ſuppoſed, a mere man, called God his own Father, thereby declaring himſelf to be equal with God, and to be God. (John v. 18. x. 33.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. What did Chriſt ever ſay of himſelf, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that he was God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0724900300:54"/>A. He ſaid that he was one with God, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took of the glory of God, before the world was, that is, from all eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Catechiſt. Repeat the paſſage, in which this is ſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. "And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine ownſelf, with the glory which I had with thee, before the world was." (John xvii. 5.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. What did Chriſt ever ſay of himſelf, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that he was equal with God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. He ſaid that "he and his Father are one:" that "the Father hath given all things into his power:" that "what things ſoever the Father doeth, theſe alſo doeth the Son likewiſe:" that "the Father hath committed all judgment to the Son, that all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father." (John x. 30.—iii. 35.— v. 19.—v. 22.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Who were the firſt witneſſes, in Chriſt's time, in proof of Chriſt's divinity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. His enemies, the unbelieving Jews, both the people, and their rulers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Do you call the unbelieving Jews prior witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the Apoſtles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes: becauſe this great truth, THE DIVINTY OF CHRIST, was hid from the Apoſtles, as well as the reſt of their countrymen, till after Chriſt's RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SURRECTION FROM THE DEAD. Chriſt firſt aſſerted himſelf to be God, by calling God his Father, and himſelf the Son of God, in a ſenſe, which implied,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0724900300:55"/>that he was equal with God, and was God; for ſo even his unbelieving hearers underſtood it:—the Jews condemned him to death for it:—the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles preached it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. As Chriſt knew, that this was the ſenſe in which the Jews underſtood his teſtimony of himſelf, when they firſt charged him with blaſphemy for it, did he, at his trial, attempt to deny the charge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. No: he admitted the charge and confirmed it, and died for it; and appealed to the day of judgment, as their future proof of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Catechiſt. Repeat the paſſage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. When "the high prieſt aſked him, and ſaid unto him, art thou the Chriſt, the Son of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? Jeſus ſaid, I am: and <hi>(as a proof of it,)</hi> YE ſhall <hi>(at the laſt day)</hi> ſee <hi>(me)</hi> the Son of man fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of Heaven." (Mark xiv. 61, 62.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. If Chriſt had not been the Meſſiah, the Son of God, in the ſenſe in which they underſtood him, would he not have undeceived them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. If Jeſus Chriſt had not been the Meſſiah, the Son of God, in the ſenſe, in which the Jews un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood him, he would have undeceived them, to ſave his own life, and to free them from a very great deluſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But Jeſus Chriſt was put to death for calling himſelf the Son of God; what then do you conclude?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. I conclude that Jeſus Chriſt really was what
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0724900300:56"/>they charged him with calling himſelf, THE SON OF GOD; and in the ſenſe in which they underſtood him; that is, that he was EQUAL WITH GOD; and was God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. You ſay that in the lifetime of Chriſt the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles appeared not to know that Chriſt was God; what was their opinion after he roſe from the dead?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Convinced by his reſurrection from the dead, according to his promiſe that he would <hi>raiſe himſelf</hi> from the dead, they believed him to be "their Lord and ther God"—"the word made fleſh;" "God manifeſted in the fleſh;" in whom <q>dwelt ALL the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily;</q> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel," or, "God with us"—"the creator and upholder of all things," who "in the beginning" of all things "was with God, and was God"— "the true God and eternal life;" and "over all God bleſſed for ever." (John xx. 28.—John i. 14. 1 Tim. iii. 16. Coi. ii. 9. Matt. i. 23.—John i. 2. Heb. i. 3. John i. 1.—1 John v. 20. Rom. ix. 5.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Whatever difficulty may be found in the various readings of any of theſe paſſages, it muſt vaniſh, like a miſt, in the full light of their united evidence. To them we may confidently add the very important teſtimonies which in the preceding remarks and examples Mr Sharp has moſt happily recovered from the erroneous conſtructions of the common verſion.</note>)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Now tell me in few words, what you collect from Chriſt's teſtimony of himſelf, as atteſted by the Jews of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0724900300:57"/>his own time, condemned by the rulers, but univerſally propagated by the Apoſtles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The concluſion to be drawn from it, is, that Chriſt, the Son of God, is one with God, and equal with God, and is God. Chriſt aſſerted it; the Jews condemned him to die for it; he ſealed his teſtimony with his blood. The Apoſtles, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by his reſurrection from the dead, believed it, and preached it, and died for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Catechiſt. The Jews, then, put Chriſt to death, as an impoſtor and blaſphemer; and yet Chriſtians have believed in him and worſhipped him, as the Son of God, for almoſt eighteen hundred years. How do you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. It was in the decrees of God, that Chriſt ſhould die for the ſins of mankind: If the Jews had believed him to be the Son of God, they would not have put him to death:—if he had not been put to death, as he was, he would not have "borne our ſins in his own body on the croſs," that is, he would not have died for our ſins, THE END, for which he CAME INTO THE WORLD;—he would not have given that great and ineſtimable proof of the truth of Scripture, and of his own promiſes, which HE did, by riſing from the dead; —and the Apoſtles would not have given that ſure evidence of their own belief in Chriſt, the ground and confirmation of OURS, which THEY did, by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their crucified Lord and Maſter.</p>
