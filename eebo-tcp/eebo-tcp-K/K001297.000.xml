            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS ſmall Treatiſe was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally intended for a private Paper of Inſtructions to the <hi>GENTLEMAN,</hi> whoſe Name it bears, to direct him how to manage himſelf under the <hi>Gout.</hi> It is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, an Abſtract of a larger one, on the ſame Subject, which has lain by me theſe ſeven Years; which, yet, I have not had Leiſure or Humour to finiſh. Several Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of this having got Abroad, and the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Condeſcendence of Pyrating Bookſellers, even to ſuch Trifles as theſe, have conſtrain'd me to let it come out in Print, as it is, to prevent its coming out from them. The
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0167900900:3"/>Gentlemen of the Profeſſion may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, by the Groſſneſs of the Philoſophy, and the low Detail of the Pharmacy, it was not deſign'd for them. If any ſhall think fit to diſpute or criticiſe on the <hi>Doctrine</hi> here laid down, they may do it ſecurely, as if the Author were as much dead, as theſe his Labours will ſhortly be: I hope I know the Value of Time and Pains, and the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of all Human Speculations better, than to employ them in defending ſuch Trifles. All I undertake for them, is, That the Facts may be depended upon for their Truth. And the Method and Medicines for their Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, towards the End, in the Circumſtances propos'd. If any Perſon under them, ſhall either amuſe himſelf, by reading this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; or lighten his Gain by following its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, I ſhall have obtain'd all I propos'd by it.</p>
            <p>As to the Account of the <hi>Bath Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> given here, it came naturally in the way of my Subject; and is ſuch as the Obſervations I have made ſuggeſted to me. I ſcarce know, and have taken no Notice of what others may have written or obſerv'd on theſe Waters; nor, indeed, had it been poſſible for me, in my preſent
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0167900900:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>Situation, being without my Books, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to Bounds, by the Nature of my Deſign. I have often obſerv'd, with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, in furniſhing ſo wonderful an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote, to almoſt all the <hi>Chronical</hi> Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution and Climate, which are chiefly owing to Errors of Diet, or rather, as a ſacred Writer expreſſes it, To <hi>Idleneſs and Fulneſs of Bread.</hi> The Rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Soil; the Richneſs of the Proviſions; the living ſo much on Fleſh Meats; the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of the Weather, and the indulging in ſedentary Amuſements, or ſpeculative Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, directly leading thereto. To remedy all which, <hi>kind Heaven</hi> has provided <hi>Bath Waters</hi> as the moſt <hi>Sovereign Reſtorative</hi> in all the Weakneſſes of the <hi>Concoctive Powers.</hi>

            <head>THE CONTENTS.</head>
            <list>
               <item>THE Introduction. <hi>Page 1. §. 1.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>That the reaſon why, of two Perſons in all other Circumſtances the ſame, the one has the <hi>Gout,</hi> the other is free from it, is, That the <hi>ſmall Veſſels</hi> of the <hi>Gouty</hi> Perſon in their <hi>original Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> are narrower and more ſtiff than thoſe of the other. <hi>p. 2. §. 2.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>That the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of an acquired <hi>Gout</hi> in the firſt Perſon, or thoſe born of ſound Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; is the abundance of <hi>Tartarous, Urinous,</hi> or other Salts introduc'd into the Blood by the Food. <hi>p. 2. §. 3.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Hence we learn the reaſon why, on the firſt Attacks of the <hi>Gout,</hi> in otherwiſe healthy People, the Humours generally fall on the Joynts of the Limbs. <hi>p. 4. §. 4.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Hence we may likewiſe ſee the reaſon, why the firſt <hi>Fits</hi> enrage and remit once in twenty four Hours: why the whole <hi>Fit</hi> laſts fourteen Days; and laſtly, why the <hi>Acceſſes</hi> and <hi>Remiſſions</hi> of thoſe broken
<pb facs="tcp:0167900900:6"/>with the <hi>Gout,</hi> happen only in fourteen Days: And why the whole <hi>Duration</hi> in ſuch is made up of ſeveral ſuch <hi>Acceſſes</hi> and <hi>Remiſſions. p. 4. §. 5.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Hence we may diſcover the reaſon why <hi>Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> Perſons are People of good natural Parts, large Feeders, and long-liv'd. <hi>p. 6. §. 6.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Hence we may conclude, that a <hi>Fit</hi> of the <hi>Gout</hi> is an Effort of Nature to throw off this abundance of Salts, through the more ſtiff and narrow <hi>Strainers;</hi> or we may conſider it as a <hi>Criſis</hi> of a putrid Fever, where the noxious Humour is diſcharg'd on ſome of the Muſcles or Joynts. <hi>Ibid. §. 7.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Hence we may diſcover the Vanity of all Pretenders to an <hi>univerſal</hi> and certain Remedy for the <hi>Gout. p. 7. §. 8.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Hence there can be but two direct ways of treating the <hi>Gout;</hi> one by widening the Capacities of the <hi>ſmall Veſſels;</hi> the other by leſſening the Quantity of the Salts. <hi>p. 8. §. 9.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>The Difference between <hi>Hereditary</hi> and <hi>Acquired Gouts. p. 8. §. 10.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>From hence is concluded the Neceſſity of a much more ſtrict Management in an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:0167900900:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>than in an <hi>Acquir'd Gout. p. 9. §. 11.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>The Advantages of Labour and Exerciſe in the <hi>Gout;</hi> to which however, two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions muſt be added: <hi>1.</hi> That it be n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <item>Two ways of leſſening the Quantity of <hi>Salts</hi> in the Blood. The firſt by a vegetable Diet, and the Inconveniences thereof. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro</hi>'s Diet recommended. <hi>p. 11. §. 13.</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0167900900:15"/>Abundance of Tartarous, Urinous, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Salts, introduc'd into the Blood by the Food. Salts ſeem neither to periſh, nor to be begotten; but to be conſtant and incorruptible Parts of Animal and Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Bodies. The Delicacy and Flavour of Fleſh and Fiſh, is entirely owing to their abounding with a fine, ſoft, oyly, or urinous Salt, as is evident in Veniſon and Wild Fowl. Wines, of all kinds, have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or leſſer Quantity of Tartar in them: And other ſtrong Liquors abound in their peculiar Salts, in Proportion to their Strength. Spirits are nothing but a great Quantity of Vegetable Salts crowded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a little Water and Oyl. Theſe Salts receiv'd in abundance, but neither ſufficiently broke by the Digeſtive Powers, nor driven out of the Habit by due Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; but by their Plenty and Nearneſs, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting in greater Cluſters, muſt neceſſarily form Obſtructions, and give Pain, when, by the Force of the Circulation, they are thruſt through narrower and ſtiffer<note n="*" place="bottom">Capillaries.</note> ſmall Veſſels. Nothing either receiv'd or bred within the Body, beſides theſe Salts, can account for this Difference.</p>

Hence we may learn the Reaſon why, on the firſt Attacks of the <hi>Gout,</hi> in otherwiſe healthy People, the Humours generally fall on the Joints of the Limbs: Becauſe, in the Joints, the ſmalleſt Veſſels are more compreſs'd, by the larger Heads or Protuberancy of the Bones, and are thereby render'd narrower and more readily obſtructed. Theſe Obſtructions fall on the Joints of the Limbs; becauſe of the greater Length of theſe ſmall Veſſels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Heart, the Origin of the Motion of all the Fluids, and theſe Joints; their other Extremity: Whereby the Quickneſs of the Circulation diminiſhing, Obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are there more readily form'd.</p>

               <hi>Coroll.</hi> 2. Hence likewiſe we may ſee the Reaſon, why the firſt Fits, of other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe healthy Perſons, Enrage and Remit once in Four and Twenty Hours. The<note n="*" place="bottom">When it begins to enrage.</note> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs being at Sun-ſet, and the<note n="†" place="bottom">When it begins to be eaſier.</note> Remiſſion about Day-break. Why the whole Fit in ſuch laſts about fourteen Days. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, why the particular Acceſſes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, of Perſons advanc'd in Years, and broken with the <hi>Gout,</hi> happen only once in fourteen Days. And why the whole
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0167900900:17"/>Duration of the Fit is made up of ſeveral ſuch Acceſſes and Remiſſions in equal Times. In the firſt Stages of the <hi>Gout,</hi> the Fluids being leſs Sizy and Glutinous, their Salts and Sizineſs are ſooner broken and diſſolv'd, by the Action of the Solids in the Circulation; and are thereby ſooner brought into a Condition to be carry'd off by Perſpiration; which makes an Acceſs and a Remiſſion. The greater Weight and Groſsneſs of the Air (which hinders Perſpiration) at Sun-ſet, beyond what it is at Day-break, together with the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Degree of Sizineſs, ſeems to determine the Times. The greater Degree of Sizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Fluids, of People advanc'd in Years, and broken with the <hi>Gout,</hi> leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens out the Duration of theſe Acceſſes and Remiſſions. And the preciſe Period of fourteen Days, ſeems to ariſe from the ſpecial Nature of the Sizineſs of the Fluids; and its Reſemblance to that of a Regular intermittent Fever. The whole Duration of whoſe Fits put together, <hi>Sydenham</hi> has obſerv'd already, to be equal to fourteen Days. But the particular Explication of all theſe Things, wou'd require more Room than can be allow'd them, in the Bounds

Hence we may diſcover the Reaſon of the common Obſervation, that Gouty Perſons are People of good Natural Parts, large Feeders, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd: Becauſe the Fibres of the ſmalleſt Veſſels, being more ſtiff and ſpringy than ordinary, The Circulation is brisker, more full and free: Whereby the<note n="*" place="bottom">That is Eating, Digeſting, and Evacuating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

From theſe alſo, we may diſcover what a Fit of the <hi>Gout</hi> is, to wit, An Effort of Nature, to throw off this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Salts, through more ſtiff and narrow<note n="†" place="bottom">Secretory Ducts.</note> Strainers.

What is certain is this, That Perſons of a large Appetite, as <hi>Gouty</hi> Perſons generally are, feeding plentifully of Fleſh and Fiſh, and drinking liberally of generous Wines, or other ſtrong Liquors, and uſing, either too little, or too much Exerciſe, muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily overſtock their Blood with theſe fix'd and incorruptible Parts of Animal and Vegetable Bodies; which in their Nature being Hard and Burning, can't fail, firſt, to raiſe a Tumult and Fever; and then to give violent Pain, as they are driven out of the Habit, through more ſtiff and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſmall Veſſels, by the Force of the Circulation: So that a Fit of the <hi>Gout</hi> may be conſider'd, as a <hi>Criſis</hi> of a putrid Fever, wherein the noxious Humour is thrown upon ſome of the Muſcles or Joints of the Body.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0167900900:20"/>unleſs a Remedy could be found, which at once cou'd change and new-mould the ſolid Parts of Human Bodies; alter the Nature and Qualities of Animal and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable Bodies; and deſtroy Parts, that are in their own Nature fix'd and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, it is impoſſible it ſhou'd be certain and univerſal; and how poſſible ſuch a Remedy is, I leave every one to judge.</p>

But to make Labour and Exerciſe as uſeful as they may be, two Cautions muſt be added to them: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that they be not too violent, in reſpect of the Patient. For

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0167900900:24"/>the whole Maſs of the Fluids; impairs the Strength, and diſpirits the Man: And thereby neceſſarily begets the worſt kind of Hyſterical and Hypocondriacal Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and all their black and diſmal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences (at leaſt till the Body has been long accuſtom'd to it) which is a Diſeaſe far worſe than the <hi>Gout</hi> it ſelf: And to which the <hi>Gout</hi> only brings the Patient, in its laſt and fatal Stages. <hi>Secondly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Diet, once enter'd upon, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after to be chang'd, under the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of certain Death, or the moſt violent enraging of all the <hi>Gouty</hi> Symptoms. For a Vegetable Diet, as has been juſt now hinted, weakening the Digeſtive Powers, and all the Functions of Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Patient can never after be brought to bear with a free way of living, without the Hazard of certain Death, or a violent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging of the <hi>Gouty</hi> Symptoms; as is too plain from many<note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0167900900:25"/>of them in ſmall, and conſtantly equal Quantities; in Weight and Meaſure; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Craving of the Appetite, and proportion'd for the mere Support of Life.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XIV</label> The other direct way of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Salts out of the Habit is by Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Sydenham,</hi> otherwiſe a moſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Obſerver of Nature, and a moſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Practitioner, has been the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I think, of a great Miſtake in the Management of the <hi>Gout;</hi> by forbidding almoſt all Evacuations, either in the Fit, or in the Intervals, for fear of weakening the Conſtitution. There are two Seaſons, to wit, Spring and Fall, when the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odical Fits of regular <hi>Gouts</hi> commonly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; which I conſider as Cardinal and Critical Diſcharges, under general and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Influences, for purifying the Blood, and diſcharging the <hi>Gouty</hi> Salts: In which, Nature is no more to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb'd in its Operations (I mean as to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, for even then a gentle, ſlow, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and uniform Perſpiration and Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sweat may be promoted, not only ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but with great Advantage) than in the Monthly Purgations of the Sex. But in light, flying Touches of the <hi>Gout,</hi> out
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0167900900:26"/>of theſe Seaſons; and in the Intervals of the Fits, gentle, warm, ſtomachick Purgers will be an excellent Remedy to ſend theſe a going, to leſſen the Fits, and lengthen the Intervals. A Perſon out of the Pain and Inflammation of the Fits, and in their Intervals (except his natural Diſpoſition to breed another Fit) is, to all Intentions of Medicines, the ſame as a well Perſon. And all Medicines levell'd againſt other Diſeaſes incident to human Bodies, may be as ſafely adminiſter'd to a <hi>Gouty</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard being had to his particular Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) as to any other Perſon. Wherefore, the general and direct Methods of relieving the <hi>Gout,</hi> are, In the Fits, a gentle, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, continu'd Perſpiration and Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sweat. In the Intervals, Labour or Exerciſe, and gentle, Stomachick Purgers.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XV</label> The Secondary or leſs direct Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of relieving the <hi>Gout,</hi> are principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe two, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Dilution, by proper Liquors. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Strengthners of the Inſtruments of the Digeſtion. Nothing is more likely to thin the Blood, to diſſolve and break the Salts, and keep them at a diſtance from running into Cluſters, than proper Diluters; as we ſee in Fevers,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0167900900:27"/>Rheumatiſms, and other inflammatory Diſtempers. For this Reaſon, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it is, that <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>German Spaw</hi> Waters, and all other <hi>Mineral Chalybeat</hi> Waters; Dwarf-Elder Tea; Trifoil Tea; light, quick, Green Tea; ſmall ſpicy Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on Water, and ſuch like, drunk free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Blood warm, on an empty Stomach, become ſo uſeful in Intervals of the <hi>Gout.</hi> Water is the univerſal Diſſolvent of Salts of all ſorts; and being repleniſh'd with the ſpicy, bitter and active Parts of other Bodies, it ſtrengthens the Stomach, and Bowels; breaks and diſſolves the Salts; cleanſes the inſides of the Veſſels from the foulneſs that conſtantly adheres to them, and carries it out of the Body, by increas'd Perſpiration and Urine.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XVI</label> Strengthners of the Inſtruments of Digeſtion, are an excellent Remedy in the Intervals of the <hi>Gout.</hi> If the Digeſtions be true and good; the Parts of the <hi>Chyle</hi> be made ſufficiently ſmall, and the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation be full and compleat (all which are the common Effects of Stomachick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines) the Salts will be leſs; the Obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſmall Veſſels fewer, and the Impurities of the Fluids will more eaſily
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0167900900:28"/>paſs by Perſpiration, and the other Drains of the Body; and ſo the Fits of the <hi>Gout</hi> become more eaſy, and leſs frequent. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Strengthners of the Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, I wou'd recommend a ſtrong Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Jeſuit</hi>'s Bark, in generous Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, as being the cooleſt Bitter, the moſt powerful Strengthner of relax'd <hi>Fibres</hi> in the Inſtruments of Digeſtion; and the greateſt Antidote of the urinous Salts, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if join'd with <hi>Chalybeats,</hi> and ſome Qualifiers of its mawkiſh and nauſeous Taſte. The Bark has the ſame Effect on the Coats and <hi>Fibres</hi> of the Veſſels, that Oak Bark has on raw Leather; and the ſame Effects on the Fluids to prevent their Coagulation; and to render them uniform, that the <hi>Teſtaceous</hi> Powders have on Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, or as they have on Milk, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent its Curdling: But more eſpecially, as it produces ſuch Wonders on the Solids and Fluids in intermittent Fevers; to the State and Condition of both which, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids and Fluids of <hi>Gouty</hi> Perſons bear ſo near a Reſemblance, as has been obſerv'd in <hi>Coroll.</hi> 2. Wherever the Bark is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I recommend the <hi>Glans Quercina,</hi> or Acorn, as of the ſame Claſs of Medicines,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0167900900:29"/>and in ſome Caſes of Relaxation exceeding the other. It is cool and eaſily digeſted. But they do beſt united. All bitter and ſpicy Medicines have more or leſs of the ſame Quality; but heat the Body more, and brace the <hi>Fibres</hi> leſs.</p>

               <hi>Mercury,</hi> by its Weight, and its conſtantly forming it ſelf in little Spheres (or perhaps from its greater attractive Force) throughout all its poſſible Diviſions, ſeems to offer faireſt, of any internal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, for breaking the <hi>Gouty</hi> Salts; for relaxing the <hi>Fibres;</hi> and enlarging the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of the ſmall Veſſels. And the Fact is, that by a full and free Salivation <hi>Gouty</hi> People have been freed from all its Symptoms for ſeveral Years. But it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Matter of Fact, and Experience, that a full and free Salivation does ſo break, rend and tear all the ſmalleſt, tendereſt and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Veſſels and <hi>Fibres,</hi> that the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes in a worſe State, in reſpect of the future Fits, than it would have been in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Years Time, under the common Symptoms. For tho' a Salivation may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen all the Obſtructions of the ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; cleanſe their inſides from the Foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that cleaves to them; purify the Blood,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0167900900:30"/>and break its ſaline Impurities; yet by its great Weight, and the exceſſive Force it adds to the Blood, rending and tearing the fineſt Veſſels and <hi>Fibres;</hi> when the <hi>Gouty</hi> Perſon comes to his former Diet, and the other Circumſtances of Living; and the Fluids become thereby loaded with their Salts, they ſtick more obſtinately to the Joints, than if the Parts had been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd and broken by regular Fits of the <hi>Gout.</hi> So that a Salivation, tho' it baniſh the Fits for ſome Time, yet when the Blood is repleniſh'd again with <hi>Gouty</hi> Salts, the Habit is reduc'd to a worſe Condition, in reſpect of the future Fits, than if they had never been interrupted: And, indeed, it is obſervable, that after a full, or repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Salivation, the Man is ſeldom or ever the ſame, as to the Quickneſs of Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or the Uſage of the moſt beautiful animal Faculties. But there is an abſolute Neceſſity of having recourſe to <hi>Mercurial</hi> Vomits and Purges, when the <hi>Gout</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes fixt to, and permanent in a Place, as alſo when it is diſperſed all over the Habit, like a Rheumatiſm.

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XVIII</label> 1. On the firſt Attack of the Fit, eſpecially while the Fever, that uſhers it in, remains, Dilution is the only Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Fine, clear, old ſmall Beer, with a little old Mountain, or <hi>Madera</hi> Wine; Water boil'd with a few Spicy Seeds, mix'd with theſe Wines: Water Gruel with ſome Wine, or Hartſhorn-Drink with Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon; and little or no Fleſh Meat, will ſucceed beſt during all the Time of the Fever. After the Fit is diſtinctly form'd, the milder Cordial and Stomachick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which promote a gentle Breathing Sweat (I mean in the more compounded and tedious Fits of the <hi>Gout,</hi> chiefly in Perſons advanc'd in Years) ſuch as <hi>Gaſcoin</hi> Powder, <hi>Goa</hi> Stone, <hi>Bezoar;</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>'s Cordial, <hi>Diaſcordium,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of <hi>Alkermes,</hi> and the like, waſh'd down with clear Blood-warm Sack-whey; in every Draught of which ten or fifteen Drops of Spirit of Hartſhorn has been firſt pour'd; with Flannel on the Parts, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0167900900:32"/>much lying a Bed; ſuch a Method, and ſuch Medicines, I ſay, will beſt forward the Fit. Towards the Decline, the Stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Warmer, Spicy and Stomachick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; ſuch as <hi>Serpentary</hi> Root, <hi>Caſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munair, Zedoary,</hi> old <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuarium de Ovo,</hi> and ſuch like; with a few Grains of <hi>Camphir,</hi> and Salt of <hi>Vipers;</hi> and a good Stomach Bitter on Wine to waſh them down, will finiſh this Affair, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Bowels, and prevent the Recoil of the <hi>Gouty</hi> Humour on them. And here it may be taken Notice of, that as the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that uſhers in the <hi>Gout,</hi> is, ſo will the Fit be: If the Fever is ſhort and ſharp, the Fit will be ſo likewiſe, in regular <hi>Gouts:</hi> If it be feeble, long and lingering, the Fit will be ſuch alſo. In the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the foregoing Method and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, two Cautions are to be minded: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That during the whole Fit, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors may be more freely and ſafely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd, than ſolid Foods. For Repletion from ſolid Foods, in a Fit of the <hi>Gout,</hi> might be of fatal Conſequence, by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering a regular Fit of the <hi>Gout</hi> irregular: Whereas Fluids will certainly paſs, either by Perſpiration, Sweating, or Urine. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0167900900:33"/>The Cordial Medicines are always to be regulated, by their Lightneſs on, and Agreeableneſs to the Stomach of the Patient; (for whatever makes him ſick, will more or leſs draw in the <hi>Gouty</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour on the Stomach) and by their not rendering him more hot and reſtleſs, than the <hi>Gout</hi> it ſelf wou'd naturally make him: For if they produce an agreeable Senſation on the Stomach, and do not inflame, they will neceſſarily procure Coolneſs and Quiet.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XIX</label> Here it may be conſidered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Opiats</hi> may be ſafely given in a Fit of the <hi>Gout,</hi> to procure Reſt, and alleviate Pain. In the general, it is the ſafeſt ſide, not to adminiſter any kind of <hi>Opiats</hi> in the Fits; becauſe they conſtantly pall the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and leave a Nauſeating, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a Reaching on the Stomach, the readieſt way to bring the <hi>Gout</hi> there. But in Extremities, when the Patient has been many Days without Reſt, and the Pain becomes intolerable, all other Means fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or equally Dangerous, <hi>Opiats</hi> may be ſo qualify'd, and their miſchievous Effects ſo bridled, by joining ſpicy, nervous and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0167900900:34"/>Stomach Medicines to them, that they may become an excellent Remedy. Thus liquid <hi>Laudanum,</hi> with Tincture of <hi>Caſtor,</hi> of Snakeweed, of <hi>Diambra,</hi> of Saffron, <hi>Sal Volatile,</hi> Compound Spirit of Laven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Hyſterick Water, and ſome agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſimple Water; ſome of theſe mix'd in a due Proportion, and proper Doſe, will not only procure Reſt, and eaſe Pain, but anſwer all the other Intentions in the Cure of a Fit of the <hi>Gout.</hi> Thus alſo, <hi>London Laudanum,</hi> with old <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, or <hi>Mythridate,</hi> Serpentary Root, and unſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Species of <hi>Diambra</hi> made into a <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> with any agreeable Syrup, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, as before, will produce the ſame Effect.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0167900900:36"/>now to recommend ſome ſpecial Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which have been found uſeful in this Caſe. It is certain that great Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from Fleſh, Fiſh, and Wines, would prevent the Fluids from being overloaded with <hi>Gouty</hi> Salts. It is alſo certain, that if the Food be carried out before it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, it will be pretty near the ſame Thing, as if the Quantity carry'd out, had not been taken down. Now if a Medicine can be found, that without weakening the Stomach and Bowels, ſhall carry off the greater part of the Food, before it is quite robb'd of its Salts, it can't fail to be of great Uſe in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of the <hi>Gout.</hi> For this Purpoſe, I wou'd recommend fine Rhubarb, taken regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly once, twice, or oftner a Week, in ſuch a Doſe, as to procure two or three Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For theſe Reaſons, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe it is an excellent Stomach Bitter, as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from its Taſte, and from the ſharp Appetite it gives thoſe that take it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe it is one of the nobleſt Aſtringents hitherto known, as is evident from its Cure of Fluxes, and inteſtine <hi>Haemorrhages;</hi> and from the Tightneſs it leaves on the Bowels. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0167900900:37"/>Becauſe it requires neither Diet, nor keeping warm, nor any other particular Management; and yet taken frequently and regularly, it will carry off any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Food one pleaſes; and ſo reduce the Dier, as near as needs be, to <hi>Cornaro's,</hi> which, in Article XIII, has been ſhewn to be of ſo excellent Uſe in the <hi>Gout.</hi> I knew a Noble Lord, of great Worth, and much <hi>Gout,</hi> who, by taking from the Hands of a Quack, a Dram of Rhubarb, ting'd with <hi>Cochineal</hi> to diſguiſe it, every Morning for the Space of ſix Weeks, liv'd in Health for four Years after, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Symptom of it.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XXII</label> It is worth here taking Notice, that all the Preparations of this Medicine ſerve only to ſpoil it. And that it is beſt taken in a ſpoonful of Soup, or any other agreeable Liquor, immediately before Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or chew'd in a Morning faſting. But to thoſe to whom its Mawkiſhneſs is nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous, I would recommend this Form. <hi>Take</hi> Gentian <hi>and</hi> Zedoary <hi>of each a Dram,</hi> Serpentary <hi>Root, and unſcented Species of</hi> Diambra, <hi>of each half a Dram.</hi> Cochineal <hi>and</hi> Saffron <hi>of each a Scruple;</hi> Orange Peel <hi>an Ounce: infuſe in a Quart of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0167900900:38"/>in a warm place twenty four Hours, ſtrain, and to the Liquor add three Ounces of the beſt</hi> Rhubarb; Salt of Wormwood <hi>a Dram and half: ſet in a warm Sand heat twelve Hours; and then ſtrain a ſecond time.</hi> Of this four Spoonfuls every Night, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very other Night, as occaſion requir'd, I have found an excellent Remedy in this and other Chronical Caſes. Where no Preparations of Rhubarb will agree with the Conſtitution, as there are many ſuch, then <hi>Elixir Salutis,</hi> Tincture of <hi>Hiera Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra;</hi> a Solution of <hi>Gum Guajac,</hi> or the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Pills, might take place; but that all the preparations of <hi>Aloes</hi> are apt to throw out both <hi>Gout</hi> and <hi>Piles.</hi> However in this matter there is great Variety; out of which every one may fit themſelves with what is moſt agreeable to their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; which if they uſe regularly and frequently, they cannot fail to prevent violent Fits of the <hi>Gout,</hi> and perhaps moſt other, both Acute and Chronical Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>

Its principal Qualities are theſe. 1. The Parts of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and thoſe of Light and Fire, act mutually upon one another, more powerfully than thoſe of other Bodies. It is to their <hi>Sulphur</hi> that Bodies owe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting and refracting Virtues; from whence its Inflammability proceeds.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Sir</hi> Iſaac Newton's <hi>Treatiſe of Light and Colours,</hi> 1 <hi>Edit. in</hi> Engliſh <hi>towards the end.</hi>

The Learn'd have been divided, and much perplex'd about the Heat of <hi>Bath</hi> Waters. I have always endeavour'd to account to my ſelf for it, from the common Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mixing filings of <hi>Steel,</hi> and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> working them into a Paſte with Water, and putting them in a Cellar, under a Cock, dropping Water ſlowly and regularly; the Paſte will ferment to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0167900900:48"/>ſuch a degree, that the Water running from it ſhall be of the ſame Heat and Virtue with the <hi>Bath</hi> Waters; tho' not ſo pleaſant, nor ſo well fitted to human Bodies. This is a common Experiment, and theſe are the only natural Bodies known, which meeting together will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Heat in Water, without artificial Fires. <hi>Tournefort,</hi> in the Place before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, ſays, <q>Its certain that Filings of Iron ſteep'd in common Water will grow conſiderably warm, and much more ſo in Sea Water: And if you mingle therewith ſome <hi>Sulphur</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, you'll ſee this Mixture really burn.</q> Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> in his laſt Edition of his Opticks, <hi>pag.</hi> 354, ſays, <q>That even the groſs Body of <hi>Sulphur</hi> powder'd, and with an equal Weight of Iron filings, and a little Water made into a Paſte, acts upon the Iron; and in five or ſix Hours grows too hot to be touch'd, and emits a Flame.</q> That the Heat of the <hi>Bath</hi> Waters is owing to a Principle within themſelves, is evident, from their retaining it longer than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Water, heated to the ſame Degree, will. Wherefore there can be no Neceſſity
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0167900900:49"/>of having Recourſe to <hi>Vulcano</hi>'s or ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous Fires, to account for this Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. There are no burning Mountains known in this our <hi>Northern</hi> Climate; and 'tis pretty hard to conceive, how Fires ſhou'd have burn'd ſo long under Ground without a Vent, or any other remarkable Sign. The <hi>Sulphur</hi> in the <hi>Bath</hi> Waters is evident to the Senſes, ſwimming in large Cluſters on the Tops of the <hi>Baths</hi> mix'd with Earth, and ſome vegetable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, wherewith the Guides commonly gild Silver; and is found an excellent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in <hi>Scurvies, Leproſies, Ring-worms,</hi> and other <hi>Foulneſſes</hi> of the Skin. The Steel is manifeſted by the blewiſh Tincture given to the Water from the Pump, by an Infuſion of Nut-gall. It is true, this Tinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure is neither ſo deep, nor is it to be had from the Water, in any ſhort Time after it comes hot from the Pump, thereby to manifeſt any great Quantity of Steel in the Compoſition, ſuch as can have the full Proportion to the Experiment now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. But, to ſet this in a clearer Light, let us put together theſe Conſiderations. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That upon Diſtillation of <hi>Bath</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there remains little in the Bottom of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0167900900:50"/>the Glaſs, but the common <hi>Calx</hi> or Sea Salt, that is found in the Diſtillation of Spring Water, if we except ſome Sand or Earth, that is forc'd up by the Violence of the Pump; wherefore the <hi>Bath</hi> Waters not being impregnated with any Quantity of a ſaline Mixture, can retain nothing in their own proper Subſtance but the lighteſt Parts of the Steel and <hi>Sulphur. Secondly,</hi> That this Water is as fully impregnated with <hi>Sulphur,</hi> as it can bear, has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn: And that there muſt be a greater Proportion of Steel in <hi>Bath</hi> Water than is manifeſted to the Senſes, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd by any Experiment hitherto made, is evident from its healing Effects, which no known Medicine but Steel can bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, or account for: None but thoſe who have ſeen it, can believe the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Efficacy it has, in moſt Chronical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. What, but Steel, in a few Weeks, can make the Blood, from a white blewiſh or Tallow Hue, reſiſting the Knife, like Glew, ſwimming in its <hi>Serum,</hi> like an Iſland amidſt the Ocean, look all of a Piece, of a Scarlet Colour, and a due Proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween its nouriſhing and its watery Parts? Nothing but Steel can make a pale aſh-colour'd
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0167900900:51"/>Countenance, hollow and deep Eyes, no Appetite, little Strength, and leſs Sleep; eat, and drink, and ſleep, look gay and ſleek, like the beſt Health. Thouſands of ſuch Inſtances may be ſeen every Seaſon at theſe healthful Springs. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Effects of <hi>Sulphur</hi> in brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſenſible Appearances and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of moſt active Medicines, is very well known. Inſtances of which, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Bodies, are, <hi>Antimony</hi> and native <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar;</hi> in artificial ones, <hi>Aethiops</hi> Mineral, and <hi>Cinnabar</hi> of <hi>Antimony:</hi> In all which the <hi>Mercury</hi> is ſo bridled up by the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> that none of their ſenſible Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Appearances are felt, while they produce the moſt wonderful Changes on animal Bodies. I cannot paſs over <hi>Aethiops</hi> Mineral without preſſing its more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Uſe than, for ought I know, it has yet had in common Practice. It is one of the moſt certain and univerſal Alteratives, if dos'd ſufficiently and long enough perſiſted in, of all the <hi>Diſpenſatory.</hi> It radically extirpates the Itch, the Piles, ſcorbutick and ſcrophulous Ulcers; all cutaneous Foulneſſes; all Inflammations and Fluxions of the Eyes; all internal Ulcers, Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0167900900:52"/>white Swellings; ſharp Humours in the Stomach and Guts, and almoſt all Diſtempers ariſing from ſizy Juices. I ſay, it cures theſe, if Art can do it; for ſome of theſe (like hereditary <hi>Gouts</hi>) are ſo tranſubſtantiated into the Solids, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a new Conformation of Parts can cure them. It may be given almoſt to half an Ounce a Day, eſpecially with interſpers'd <hi>Mercurial</hi> Purges, without Trouble, or any ſenſible Operation, and continu'd for a Twelve-Month, if one plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The fineſt <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and fitteſt to make <hi>Aethiops</hi> of, is common <hi>Sulphur</hi> pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, and boiled ſeven or eight Times in Spring Water, whereby it becomes as light on the Stomach as prepared Pearl, and as effectual in the Caſes mentioned, as the celebrated <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Aix la Chappelle</hi> Waters.

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XXVII</label> The ſum of all then is, ſince the <hi>Bath</hi> Waters derive their Heat from a Principle within themſelves; ſince no natural Body, but <hi>Sulphur</hi> and Iron can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch a Degree of Heat, as is in them; ſince nothing but Steel can produce thoſe wonderful Cures on human Bodies, which <hi>Bath</hi> Waters do; ſince <hi>Sulphur</hi> will lock up
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0167900900:53"/>and bridle the ſenſible Appearances and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the moſt active Bodies, and yet not deſtroy their healthful and medical virtues; it is plain, that <hi>Bath</hi> Waters muſt owe their Heat to a Mixture of ſteely and ſulphurous Particles; and their healthful Effects to a greater Proportion of Steel, than is ſenſible, or eaſily diſcoverable by any Experiment hitherto made, join'd to a light <hi>Sulphur,</hi> whoſe Virtues and Efficacy in all Chronical Caſes, we have already ſhewn. The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which ſurround the Place, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body now knows, to be but the Neſts of Minerals, and the Receptacles of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which feed the Springs, (which Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are continued even to the Sea) confirm this Opinion. The manner I conceive thus: The Dews drilling and dropping through the Cranies of the Mountains, fall upon a Bed of Iron Oar, and are there as fully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with <hi>Chalybeat</hi> Particles as ſuch Water can bear; and gently owzing down upon a Neſt of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and there ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch a degree, that requiring more room, they bubble up at the Foot of the Mountains, with their ſulphurous Spoils, and furniſh out this healing and balſamick Fluid. All hot Waters ſeem chiefly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0167900900:54"/>of theſe two Principles; and to differ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the <hi>Sulphur</hi> or <hi>Steel</hi> predominates in them. Where the <hi>Sulphur</hi> predominates, they are hotter, more nauſeous, and more purgative. Of the three hot <hi>European</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Note, the <hi>Aix la Chapelle, Bourbon,</hi> and <hi>Bath;</hi> the firſt abounds more eminently in <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which makes its Heat, Nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Purgative Faculty ſo great, that few weak Stomachs can bear its Heat and Nauſeouſneſs; and fewer weak Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Violence of its purging. The <hi>Bourbon</hi> are of a middle Nature, between the <hi>Aix la Chapelle</hi> and the <hi>Bath</hi> Waters, and are leſs hot, nauſeous and purgative than the <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> but more than the <hi>Bath</hi> Waters. The <hi>Bath</hi> partake leſs of the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> and more of the <hi>Steel</hi> than either of theſe two; and are by far the moſt pleaſant; of a milky Taſte, never purge, except they be drunk either too faſt, or in too great Quantities, and always mend the Appetite, and raiſe the Spirits. The weakeſt hot Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are but of little Uſe, except in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Caſes, and in hectick or conſumptive Conſtitutions; but for medical Uſes, the weaker hot Waters may be made pretty near equal to the ſtronger by Evaporation, as to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0167900900:55"/>the ſulphurous Principle; as the ſtronger may be brought down to the weaker by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, as I have experienc'd; tho' Nature be always the wiſeſt and moſt perfect Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator. But neither the ſame Proportion of <hi>Steel,</hi> nor <hi>Sulphur,</hi> nor Heat, indifferently fit all Conſtitutions. Generally the Strength (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Quantity of <hi>Steel</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi>) of the ſame hot Waters is in proportion to their Heat; and therefore to fit the ſame Waters to weaker Conſtitutions, they need only be drunk proportionably cooler.</p>

And therefore it might be as reaſonably doubted, if in the Intervals of two putrid Fevers (of which many have had more than two in their Life-time) a Perſon might ſafely bath. There is no Queſtion, but that a <hi>Gouty</hi> Perſon may both as ſafely bath, and take any Medicine, for any incident Diſeaſe, as any other Perſon; regard being had to his particular Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. And 'tis Matter of Fact, that thoſe who have been crippl'd by the fixing of the <hi>Gouty</hi> Salts upon the Joints, or diſabl'd by the Tenderneſs of the Parts, have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely reliev'd by a long Courſe of drinking
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0167900900:58"/>and bathing in theſe hot Waters, which by relaxing the <hi>Fibres,</hi> diſſolving the ſizy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, diluting the <hi>Gouty</hi> Salts, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them paſs by Perſpiration, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd them to the Uſe of their Limbs.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XXX</label> The other Difficulty is, how the ſame hot Water ſhou'd relax contracted <hi>Fibres,</hi> as in the <hi>Gout</hi> and <hi>Rheumatiſm;</hi> and yet contract and brace relax'd <hi>Fibres,</hi> as in the Palſie and waſted Limbs. That the Matter of Fact is ſo, is paſt all Doubt in theſe and many other Caſes of Contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Relaxation. But to clear up this, we need only to conſider what Contraction and Relaxation are. Since all the Fluids of the Body are contain'd in Veſſels, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction can ariſe from nothing but from the Blood and other Fluids (or whatever is the Cauſe of Muſcular Motion) Their being retain'd and obſtructed by their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs; or from ſome external Injury, in the Subſtance of the Muſcle it ſelf; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it becomes fuller and firmer, and ſo acts as upon its Office of Contraction. Relaxation, upon the other hand, is an Obſtruction of the Nerves or Veſſels of the Fluids, before they arrive at the Muſcles; as is ſeen in Palſies and the Nervous <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophy</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0167900900:59"/>of the Limbs; ſo that in both Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Obſtructions are the Cauſe both of Contraction and Relaxation. Wherefore, whatever Medicine can diſſolve the Sizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Fluids; open the Obſtructions of the ſmall Veſſels; make the Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion full and free, and brace the <hi>Fibres;</hi> will both contract Relaxations, and relax Contractions: And that theſe are ſome of the Effects of <hi>Bath</hi> Waters, has, I think, been made ſufficiently appear.</p>

I think it may be ſafely advanc'd, That any Quantity greater than an <hi>Engliſh Quart,</hi> in a Morning, drunk in two Hours Time, half a Pint every half Hour, is more than what is reaſonable. For, drinking in this Proportion, all the reſt of the Day; at
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0167900900:63"/>Meals, <hi>to wit,</hi> in the Afternoon, and going to Bed, they muſt take down no leſs than five Pounds in about ſixteen Hours; <hi>viz.</hi> two Pounds in the Morning, a Pint and an half with Wine at Dinner, half a Pound in the Afternoon, and as much at Supper and at going to Bed. This every Body muſt ſee is fully ſufficient to anſwer all the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of drinking <hi>Mineral</hi> Waters. A grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Quantity than this will ſerve only to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtend and <hi>relax</hi> the Alimentary Paſſages; to force its way through the largeſt, and moſt patent <hi>Tubes;</hi> and to propagate the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation through the Branches and <hi>Inoſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the larger Arteries and Veins, where the leaſt Foulneſs and feweſt Obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can happen: So that it will ſcarce ever reach the fineſt Capillary Veſſels, in which alone the Danger lies.

In moſt Caſes a <hi>Pint</hi> in a Morning is ſufficient, and in low Constitutions and Diſorders in the Alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Paſſages, tending to Vomiting and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0167900900:64"/>Purging, <hi>half a Pint</hi> is enough; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Quantity is to be drunk, 'tis always beſt to take it in ſmall Quantities, and at good Diſtances, provided it come within the Compaſs of the Morning. What is drunk at Meals, tho' cold, yet being freſh, and not altogether drain'd of its Principles and Virtues, contributes near as much to the Cure, as that which is taken in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The Afternoon and Evening's Draughts are more <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> and muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Obſervation of the Patient, as he finds them agreeable to his Stomach, and ſit eaſily or not: Where too great Quantities have not been ſwallow'd down in a Morning, they are very proper, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they be in Proportion to the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning's Quantity, and never taken under four or five Hours after Dinner; and that at Night, not under two or three Hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Supper; theſe Times being the moſt proper to aſſiſt the Digeſtion, and carry off the Remains of the Food. But the Truth is, as nothing is more neceſſary, in a Courſe of theſe Waters, than ſetting out right at firſt; ſo nothing requires more the Experience and Judgment of a Phyſician, than the accommodating the previous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0167900900:65"/>the Quantities to be drunk, and the Medicines to be taken with them, to the Diſtemper and the Conſtitution of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. For theſe once ſettl'd, the reſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally goes on ſucceſsfully.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0167900900:66"/>as were afflicted with this Diſtemper (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Stones found ſometimes in the Gall-bladder, but of this I can affirm no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) are, to all their eſſential Qualities, the ſame. They have both the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Taſte and Smell; they yield both the ſame Principles, and produce the ſame Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, when treated chymically. They have both the ſame internal Texture of Parts, as far as can be known, and even the ſame outward Shape, when unbroken and unconfin'd by hard Subſtances; and they generally happen to one and the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: At leaſt it ſeldom comes to paſs, that any one is much troubl'd with the <hi>Gout,</hi> but he has the <hi>Stone</hi> at laſt. And this ſhews that they are both owing to the ſame Conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Parts, and other general Cauſes. It is true, ſome have ſuffer'd violently by the <hi>Stone,</hi> who never had the <hi>Gout;</hi> but this may be owing to a ſpecial, hereditary Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs and Stiffneſs of the Urinary Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in reſpect of the other Veſſels; and a particular unhappy Texture of Parts, as it happens to ſome other Organs in other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: For fat People have ſmaller Veſſels in proportion to their Stature than lean. But in the general, it is pretty conſtant,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0167900900:67"/>that thoſe who ſuffer long under ſevere Fits of the <hi>Gout,</hi> ſeldom eſcape the <hi>Stone.</hi> Dr. <hi>Cyprianus,</hi> the late ingenious Cutter for the <hi>Stone,</hi> had obſerv'd, that thoſe who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drunk Malt Liquor were ſeldom ever vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently afflicted with that Diſtemper: And among many hundreds he had cut, he had never found one, who had only drunk Ale or Beer. Whether this was owing to the leſſer Quantity of Salts in thoſe Liquors than in Wine, or to the Slipperineſs they induce upon the Bowels and other Veſſels, or to both, I will not here take upon me to determine. But I believe the Fact is, both in the <hi>Stone</hi> and acquired <hi>Gouts,</hi> that thoſe who only drink Malt Liquors, without Wine or Spirits, are ſeldom violently afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with either. And for the ſame Reaſons it comes to paſs, that the <hi>Gouts</hi> and <hi>Gravels</hi> of the Sex, are ſeldom ſo ſevere as in Men; they generally drinking leſs Wine, and feeding leſs of Fiſh and Fleſh Meats. And that in the <hi>Gouts,</hi> both of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who drink no Wine nor Spirits, any little proper Medicine has entirely kept off the Pain, and prevented the Fits. I know an antient Gentleman, formerly treated pretty roughly by the <hi>Gout,</hi> who drinking
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0167900900:68"/>only Malt Liquors, has, for ſeveral Years, with certain Succeſs, entirely kept off the Pains and Fits of the <hi>Gout,</hi> by taking only every Morning, regularly, a Pint of warm White-wine Whey, to encourage Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Which when he neglects to do, they as certainly return. We may therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, 1. That ſince the <hi>Gout</hi> and <hi>Gravel</hi> Stones are, as to their eſſential Qualities, much the ſame; and ſince 'tis hardly poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to account for the breeding of the <hi>Stone,</hi> but from a particular Narrowneſs and Stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Urinary Veſſels, and an Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſuch Salts in the Fluids; it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable, that the <hi>Gout</hi> muſt proceed from the ſame general Cauſes: And this is ſome kind of Confirmation of the two firſt Propoſitions laid down in the beginning of this Diſcourſe. 2. The ſame Method and Medicines that have been deduc'd from the firſt two Propoſitions, for relieving <hi>Gouty</hi> Perſons, in the Intervals of the Fits, will likewiſe ſerve for preventing the Encreaſe of the <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Gravel;</hi> as we are certain they do from the beſt Experience and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in this Caſe. I will now go on with my purpoſe, and conſider an irregular <hi>Gout,</hi> fix'd on theſe three great Inſtruments of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

In young and ſtrong Conſtitutions, <hi>Mercurial</hi> and <hi>Antimonial</hi> Vomits will do Wonders, tho' they are ſeldom to be ventur'd upon in any Conſtitution above Forty. The Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here to be had in View (as in all other irregular <hi>Gouts</hi>) is to expel the <hi>Gouty</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour outwardly upon the Muſcles or Joynts, and to fix it there. Wherefore in order to carry it to as great a Diſtance from the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Organs as may be, a free Paſſage is to be open'd to it on the Limbs, by bliſtering the Ancles and Wriſts; and to promote its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance thither, gentle Stomach Purgers are to be pour'd down continually, two or three Spoonfuls every third Hour, 'till the Effect is obtain'd.

Wherefore upon the firſt Seizure of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, a Vomit is inſtantly to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, and repeated according to the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Caſe: After that <hi>Hiera Picra</hi> as is before caution'd and qualify'd, with a hot <hi>Sinapiſm,</hi> or Bliſter oh the Ancles: And laſt of all, the higheſt Cordials, and moſt generous Wines, may be freely indulg'd, without fear of Inflammation.

All I can further add to what has been ſaid, is, that under the Fit, White Wines are more eligible than Red; becauſe thoſe part more readily with their Spirits, and are leſs aſtringent than theſe. And for the ſame Reaſon in the Intervals, the Red is preferable to the White: Tho' neither of them, in either Caſe, be uſeful or neceſſary, but becauſe Cuſtom or Habit, which it is not ſafe to alter ſuddenly, has made them ſo.

Nothing made a greater Noiſe upon its firſt Reſtoration, and nothing cou'd have ſunk lower in its Reputation ſince, than Cold Bathing: And it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways happen ſo in Things fitted to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Capacity, when they are univerſally
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0167900900:74"/>preſcrib'd, without Diſtinction and without Choice. Thoſe who know how greatly Foulneſs and Uncleanlineſs promote Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical, Peſtilential and Infectious Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, can only tell what Cleanneſs contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to Health. The <hi>Eaſtern</hi> People (whoſe Lazineſs, in other Things, is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Climate) have found Cold Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and Ablution ſo neceſſary to their Health, that they have made it a part of their Religion, as it is a Precept of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of a nobler Extract, from whence they borrow'd it. If the modern Doctrine be true, as I really think it is, that the ſmalleſt <hi>Fibres,</hi> or thoſe of the laſt Diviſion, in ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Bodies, be not open and pervious, but ſolid; then it may be affirm'd, that warm Water (I mean pure Element, endu'd with no Medical Principle) by the active Power of its Heat, muſt neceſſarily relax ſuch <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres.</hi> And that cold Water from the <hi>Nitre,</hi> which produces its Coldneſs, muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily contract them. The Tumour of the <hi>Gout,</hi> like other inflammatory Swellings, is owing to an Obſtruction, or to the <hi>Gouty</hi> Humours flowing faſter by the <hi>Arteries,</hi> than it can be receiv'd by the Veins; the Smalleſt or Capillary Veſſels are thereby
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0167900900:75"/>extended and ſtretch'd, beyond their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Power of Reſtitution; ſo that when the <hi>Gouty</hi> Humour is ſpent by Perſpiration, or driven into the Veins by the ſucceſſive Stroaks of the Circulation; the Obſtruction remov'd; and the Pain entirely gone off; the Veſſels continue thus widen'd and ſtretch'd, beyond their Power of Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for a long Time after. And this is the ſole Cauſe of the long and tedious Weakneſs on the Part after the Fit is over; which wou'd yet continue longer, did not the Coolneſs and Preſſure of the Ambient Air, and the now ſufferable Weight of the Cloathing, give the firſt Impulſes to the <hi>Fibres</hi> towards their contracting themſelves again: Now nothing in Nature can ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily or ſo certainly bring this about, as Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in cold Water: For the <hi>Nitre</hi> in the Water, which is the Cauſe of its Coolneſs; and alſo the uniform equal Preſſure upon the Part, which ariſes from its Gravity and Flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, concur to communicate to the <hi>Fibres</hi> a ſtrong and laſting Impulſe towards reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to their natural State of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. And the <hi>Gouty</hi> Humour now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent, and the Obſtruction entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, as is ſuppos'd, how can any ſuch
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0167900900:76"/>Humour be tranſlated upon another part, by cold Bathing, more than if the Perſon had never had the <hi>Gout?</hi> Now to make this Remedy ſtill more effectual, after a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Courſe of cold Bathing, cold Pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the part, by the Force of a Pump, or the Fall of Water from a Height, may be conveniently us'd: The wonderful Efficacy of which is no leſs certain here, than it is in White Swellings on the Joints, where, I think, it is a never failing Remedy. I am very well inform'd of the Caſe of a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Perſon, who, for many Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being tormented with conſtant and uninterrupted Pains of the <hi>Gout,</hi> Summer and Winter, by daily bathing in a Tub of cold Water, has, for theſe ſeveral Years by-paſt, brought them to regular and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odical Fits, at the Cardinal and Critical Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only; and of no longer Duration than uſual. I know alſo an ingenious Phyſician, who, after a Fit of the <hi>Gout,</hi> goes daily into the cold Bath, till the part has recover'd its natural Strength, which conſtantly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in much leſs Time than it wou'd do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.

All the Solids of the Body are made up of ſmall Threads or Filaments of different Natures and Textures. They are divided into the <hi>Fleſhy,</hi> the <hi>Nervous,</hi> the <hi>Membranous,</hi> and the <hi>Bony;</hi> and make up the ſolid Subſtance of the whole Animal Body: But all of them agree in a greater or leſſer Degree of Springineſs or Elaſticity. And it is obſervable, that ſome of the moſt perfect ſpringy Bodies, are made of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and vegetable Subſtances; ſuch as Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Ebony and Whalebone. Wherein the general Nature of Elaſticity conſiſts, or what is the particular Cauſe of the eminent Springineſs of animal <hi>Fibres,</hi> is as hard to explain as conceive; which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the nobleſt Inſtrument of all the Actions and Functions of an animated Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. All the Attempts hitherto made to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0167900900:78"/>diſcover the particular Nature of a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractile</hi> and <hi>Diſtractile</hi> Animal <hi>Fibre,</hi> to me ſeem inſufficient and conjectural. <hi>Lewenhoeck</hi> has diſcover'd, by his Glaſſes, that the ſmalleſt <hi>Fibre</hi> of an <hi>Elephant</hi> is not big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than that of the ſmalleſt <hi>Inſect:</hi> And if the modern Syſtem of Generation be juſt, to wit, That an Animal or Plant comes from another leſſer one; then Growth is nothing, but the unfolding the original <hi>Membranes</hi> and <hi>Fibres:</hi> And the length of every <hi>Fibre</hi> is the ſame in the youngeſt, as in the full grown Animal or Plant. So Growth and Motion both, that is, the whole Buſineſs of the Animal Life, is owing to the Springineſs of theſe <hi>Fibres.</hi> The beſt Reſemblance I can make of them, is that of a long Hair, or ſmall twiſted Gut, which, when ſtretch'd to any length beyond its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural State, will reſtore it ſelf again to its former Dimenſions. And in this Contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Reſtitution of an Animal <hi>Fibre;</hi> the greateſt Myſteries of the whole Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſiſt. As there are ſome People who have hard, groſs, ſtiff Hair, with a ſtrong Spring; ſo there are others, who have ſoft, fine, weak Hair, with a feeble Spring: And generally ſpeaking, as the Hair is, ſo the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0167900900:79"/>Threads, Filaments and <hi>Fibres</hi> of the Body are. Thoſe whoſe <hi>Fibres</hi> are ſoft, fine, weak and of a feeble Spring, are generally ſaid to be of weak <hi>Nerves,</hi> and liable to <hi>Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> Diſtempers. And here we may obſerve the Difference between more tenſe and ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Fibres,</hi> and more ſpringy and elaſtick ones. All the <hi>Fibres</hi> of the Body are in a State of <hi>Diſtenſion,</hi> as is evident from the gaping Lips of Wounds. Two Perſons may have <hi>Fibres</hi> of the ſame Degree of Springineſs and Elaſticity; and yet in their natural State, and original Formation, the <hi>Fibres</hi> of the one may be more ſtretch'd, bent and diſtracted, and conſequently more ſtiff and tenſe than thoſe of the other; whereby the more ſtiff or tenſe <hi>Fibres</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a greater Reſiſtance, and being with more Difficulty ſtretch'd and widen'd, will give more Pain, when a groſs Fluid paſſes thro' them, than leſs ſtiff or tenſe <hi>Fibres</hi> will. Which gives an Account why of two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, both of them of weak <hi>Nerves,</hi> the one ſhou'd have the <hi>Gout,</hi> the other be free from it. Perſons of weak <hi>Nerves</hi> muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily have leſs Strength, a weaker Pulſe and Digeſtion; a ſlower and more imperfect Circulation of the Fluids, and a leſs free
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0167900900:80"/>and perfect Perſpiration; and if they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to indulge in ſtrong Meats and generous Wines, they muſt become ſubject to <hi>Hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, Hypochondriac</hi> and <hi>Cephalic</hi> Diſorders. But if, together with weak <hi>Nerves,</hi> a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Degree of Tenſity or Stiffneſs be join'd, under the ſame Circumſtances, they will be liable to <hi>Gouty,</hi> together with the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Diſorders. But by reaſon of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Weakneſs and leſs Original Springineſs of their <hi>Nervous Fibres,</hi> the Fits of theſe <hi>Gouts</hi> will be leſs painful and more conſtant.</p>

               <hi>Coroll.</hi> From this Account of the <hi>Nervous Gout</hi> and other <hi>Nervous</hi> Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, 'tis plain, all Evacuations (except the moſt gentle) muſt be prejudicial in them. Gentle Vomits, as they cleanſe the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Bowels, and principally as they free the <hi>Nerves</hi> from all extraneous Bodies, and increaſe the Perſpiration, by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Convulſions and Contractions of the internal Muſcles and Membranes; Bliſters, as they open the Obſtructions of the ſmall Veſſels, by their external, and thin the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy Juices by their internal Efficacy; I ſay, both theſe Evacuations, may not only ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but with great Advantage, be us'd in <hi>Nervous</hi> Caſes. But all violent Purges and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0167900900:81"/>exceſſive Bleedings, are religiouſly to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd from, as encreaſing the original Weakneſs. Purges in People of weak <hi>Nerves,</hi> in Chronical Caſes, carry off a great part of the Nouriſhment of almoſt three Days. Vomits, on the contrary, carry off only thoſe Crudities, that ſend up to the Head and <hi>Nervous</hi> Syſtem, the noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fumes and Vapours that cauſe their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. Purges relax and weaken the <hi>Fibres</hi> of a natural and neceſſary Function, to wit, thoſe of Digeſtion: Whereas Vomits can but weaken the Action of <hi>Muſcular Fibres,</hi> leſs us'd, ſtrong in themſelves, and not ſo neceſſary to Concoction; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from <hi>Monſieur Chirac</hi>'s Experiment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Vomiting. Purges carry off little, but what wou'd otherwiſe paſs off, in Time, by the natural Courſe of the <hi>Periſtaltic</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and generally leave behind them what wants the inverted Motion, as they found it. Whereas Vomits pump up thoſe Crudities, that Nature it ſelf would (gladly, ſo to ſpeak) throw up, by the ſame Organs, the ſame way Nature tends. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> four and acid Humours, lodg'd in the Stomach and Guts, muſt neceſſarily weaken both, more than either gentle Vomits, or Purges
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0167900900:82"/>poſſibly can; with this Difference, tho' that a very gentle, natural, or artificial Purging, continu'd for any long Time, in Perſons of weak <hi>Nerves,</hi> ſhall both weaken the Perſon, and waſte the <hi>Muſcular</hi> Fleſh. Whereas you ſhall find, after ſeveral Months daily Vomiting, in a Sea-Voyage, a Day or two's Refreſhment aſhoar, reſtores the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to a greater Degree of Alacrity and Strength than before: Whence it comes to paſs, that Perſons of weak <hi>Nerves</hi> are ſo much reliev'd and rais'd by Vomits; and, on the contrary, ſo much ſunk and depreſs'd by rough and ſtrong Purges in Chronical Caſes. What farther is to be expected in ſuch Caſes, is to be done by a regular and ſtrict Diet, fitted to the mere Neceſſities of Nature. Strengthners of the Digeſtive Faculties, (and here the <hi>Bark</hi> and <hi>Steel</hi> claim the firſt place, as being the moſt certain Strengthners of weak <hi>Nerves</hi>) gentle and conſtant Exerciſe, as encouraging the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration: <hi>Aromatick</hi> and Spicy Bitters, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile and attenuating Medicines, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be thought fit to nouriſh, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſupport the Animal Functions.</p>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0167900900:83"/>to the Subject I treat; it may not be amiſs to remove one Objection againſt it; and the only one I have ever heard or read made with any Shew of Reaſon. I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as much of it my ſelf, and as often, and have preſcrib'd it as freely as any of my Age; I believe; and never obſerv'd it, either in my ſelf or others, do any Hurt, except when it has been injudiciouſly and improperly preſcrib'd, and that in continu'd acute Caſes only. The Objection is, that it often leaves behind it a bad Habit, a <hi>Scorbutic, Cachectic,</hi> or <hi>Hectic</hi> Conſtitution; bad <hi>Lungs, Liver,</hi> or <hi>Stomach;</hi> or ſome of the great <hi>Viſcera</hi> ſpoil'd or corrupted. But the Miſtake in this Objection lies here, to wit, that few Conſtitutions break, and ſeldom any of theſe great Organs become vitiated; but they begin with an intermittent or periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Fever.</hi> And theſe I have conſtantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be of that kind, and approaching that Seaſon, which <hi>Sydenham</hi> moſt judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſtinguiſhes from <hi>Vernal</hi> ones, and calls <hi>Autumnal Agues;</hi> and are indeed ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatical only, ariſing from beginning Obſtructions in the whole Habit, or in theſe greater <hi>Viſcera:</hi> where all Nature is at work, and the whole Organs labour and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0167900900:84"/>ſtruggle to thin the ſizy Fluids, and to open the obſtructed Bowels; but not being able to bring about this End, Nature ſuccumbs after every Feveriſh Fit, thus excited, into a worſe State. And even here too, the <hi>Bark</hi> does all its proper Office, in quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to wit, the violent <hi>Paroxyſms</hi> of the <hi>Fever,</hi> which only can endanger the Life of the Patient: and allows time for other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines to act. But when the Habit is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy broken, and the great <hi>Viſcera</hi> already unſound; it cannot be blamed that it do's not reſtore theſe; nothing like that being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from it, or aſcribed to it. When the <hi>Bark</hi> has extinguiſhed the Feveriſh Fits, which threaten Death to the Patient, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve is obtain'd: in which, by deobſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and attenuating Medicines, Health and Life may be ſecured. In relax'd <hi>Nerves</hi> of the <hi>Primaeviae;</hi> in almoſt all ſorts of <hi>Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> and <hi>Cephalic</hi> Diſeaſes depending on theſe; in all <hi>Gouty</hi> Diſorders in the <hi>Alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> Paſſages; in all <hi>Nervous Gouts;</hi> in all Intermittent and <hi>Periodical</hi> Diſtempers, or Pains whatſoever: 'tis preferable to any thing hitherto us'd; only in very cold Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs and Conſtitutions, I have found a Decoction of the <hi>Indian Bark,</hi> by ſome

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XLIII</label> I have formerly obſerv'd, that when, the Gout becomes diſpers'd over the whole Habit, or fix'd and ſettl'd on a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Joynt, <hi>Mercurial</hi> Vomits and Purges were abſolutely neceſſary to diſlodge it. But there is one Species of the <hi>Gout</hi> which miſerably torments its Subjects, and yet yields not to that, or very rarely to any of the Methods in uſe; I mean the <hi>Gout</hi> on the Hip-Joint, when fix'd and conſtant, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd the <hi>Sciatica;</hi> and yet treated after the manner I'm to explain, never fails of a perfect Cure. The Foundation of the Method I had from the late <hi>moſt Learned and Eminent Phyſician Doctor Archibald Pitcairn;</hi> he having communicated it to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0167900900:86"/>me under no Reſtriction of Secrecy, I think my ſelf oblig'd to publiſh it to the World, for the Benefit of the afflicted. I have us'd it with great Succeſs theſe ſeveral Years, and I think have improv'd it in ſeveral Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the Management; and ſo never fail of a perfect Cure, if the Diſtemper is a genuine <hi>Sciatica,</hi> tho' of many Years ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and after having baffl'd all other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. It conſiſts in taking from one, two, three Drams, to half an Ounce (according to the Strength of the Patient's Stomach) of the Aetherial Oyl of <hi>Turpentine</hi> (that which comes off between the Spirit and Oyl, in drawing off the common Oyl of <hi>Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>) in triple the Quantity of Virgin Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in a Morning faſting, for four, five, ſix, or eight Days at fartheſt, intermitting a Day now and then, as the Patient's Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons require, or his Stomach ſuffers by it: In drinking, after it is down, large Draughts of Sack Whey, to ſettle it on the Stomach, and carry it into the Blood: And laſtly, in taking a proper Doſe of <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Pills eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Night, that Day the Medicine is ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This Courſe never fails to remove the Violence of the Pain, and to leave only a Weakneſs en the Part. To remove the groſſer Remains, and ſtrengthen the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0167900900:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>Part, I order a Dram or two Drams of Flower of Brimſtone, for ſome time, twice a Day, in a Tea cup full of Milk. If through great Intemperance, or a violent Cold, the Patient relapſes, I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Repetition of the former Medicines for a Day or two, which commonly ſets it a packing. And laſtly, to ſtrengthen the <hi>Primaeviae,</hi> and enliven the Spirits, I adviſe <hi>Bath</hi> or <hi>Spaw</hi> Waters with <hi>Steel,</hi> and Bitters with <hi>Volatiles;</hi> and perhaps pumping on the Part affected, which never fails to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Cure in a genuine <hi>Sciatica.</hi> And I hope it may be of ſome uſe, to have a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Cure for this Diſtemper, ſo plainly laid down, ſo effectual in it ſelf, ſo eaſy to the Patient, and ſo reſtorative of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in general, in reſpect of thoſe Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and the nauſeous Load of Medicines the afflicted are forc'd to go through in common Practice. The great Efficacy of this Courſe conſiſts in the <hi>Aetherial Oyl:</hi> It has been common to preſcribe a few Drops of the Oyl of <hi>Turpentine</hi> in cold <hi>Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſms</hi> and fix'd Pains on the Joynts: But this ſeldom proves effectual in the <hi>Sciatica:</hi> Whereas this <hi>Aetherial Oyl,</hi> having all the Penetration of the Spirit, together with the Softneſs and Detergency of the fineſt <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0167900900:88"/>but chiefly being of ſuch Lightneſs, that any Quantity of it may be given, that can ſtay on the Stomach, or be kept down by frequent Draughts of any ſoft Liquor, eſpecially Sack-Whey: which by its Milki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs uniting readily with the <hi>Aetherial Oyl;</hi> Penetrates into the leaſt and fineſt Veſſels, and the moſt ſecret Receſſes of the <hi>Animal Oeconomy;</hi> opens their Obſtructions; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves the glutinous Gellies in the Joints; cleanſes the inſides of the <hi>Tubes,</hi> and makes all paſs by Perſpiration. The Rule where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to accommodate the Doſe to the Patient, is to order it ſo, that it mayn't be ſo much as to recoil upwards; to prevent which, a large Quantity of Sack-Whey is order'd: And it ſeldom moves above once downwards; but leſt it ſhou'd go farther, in the ſubſequent Doſes, the Pills take place.</p>
