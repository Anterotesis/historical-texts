            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>ALTHOUGH publiſhers of receipts have been always very numerous, yet it has ſo happened, that the leaſt able have hitherto undertaken this taſk, as the moſt eaſy and likely to anſwer any merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary views; which ſeems to have been the reaſon, that more able perſons have neglected it as an under part of their profeſſion. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, I have perſuaded myſelf, that I ſhould perform a work, neither entirely void, of uſe, nor foreign to the duties of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, if I made the public partakers of the principal helps againſt moſt diſeaſes, which I had either learned by long experience, or ſelected from the writings of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent phyſicians. As theſe receipts are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed chiefly for the uſe of perſons reſiding in the country, whoſe convenience or abilities, will not allow of the attendance of a phyſician or apothecary, I have ſtudied plainneſs in my ſtile, and in my directions, with regard to the treatment of diſeaſes, that I might render this treatiſe as uſeful as poſſible.</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</head>
            <p>THE favourable reception this work has met with, as is ſufficiently ſhewn by the remarkable quick ſale of the firſt large impreſſion, has induced the editor (to ſupport the credit of what is really bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to the public, and add weight to the receipts) to publiſh the authorities from whence thoſe receipts were taken; and to make it ſtill more uſeful, has added the ſigns of diſeaſes, and ſome plain and conciſe direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for bleeding: he begs leave to remark, that although Dr. Theobald has given no more than one receipt for the cure of ſeveral diſorders, yet he has been careful to ſelect ſuch, <hi>only,</hi> as upon a long experience were found to be the beſt; and that although re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts are given for diſeaſes which are ſeldom cured, (as the apoplexy, conſumption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) yet if it is in the power of medicine to remove any of theſe complaints, there is the greateſt reaſon to imagine, that the remedies directed in this pamphlet will effect a cure.</p>

               <head>DIRECTIONS concerning BLEEDING.</head>
               <p>THOUGH Bleeding has been directed in many diſorders in the courſe of this work; yet as the improper uſe of it is attended frequently with the moſt fatal conſequences, it has been judged neceſſary to bring into one point of view all thoſe caſes in which bleeding may be adminiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with advantage, as well as thoſe in which it is highly prejudical. In all inflammatory diſeaſes, it ſhould by no means be omitted, as in the Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy, and Peripneumony, during the firſt days; but ſo ſoon as the ſymptoms of ſuppuration ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear expectorating medicines are the moſt proper means from which to expect relief, and the uſe of the lancet muſt be totally forbid. In the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, Epilepſy, Bloody-flux and Inflammation of the bowels, bleeding muſt be repeated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the exigence of the ſymptoms: it is alſo uſeful, ſometimes to promote ſuppuration in large abſceſſes, where nature is too much oppreſt by the violence of the inflammation. In Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Eyes, Bladder, or Womb, Iſchiatic pains, Rheumatiſms, Coughs, Head-achs, Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys, Aſthmas, Hemorrhages, and Nephritic complaints, Bleeding is of the utmoſt ſervice: but in every diſorder proceeding from a relaxed ſtate of the veſſels, and impoveriſhed ſtate of the Blood, attended with a cachectic habit of body, ſuch as Dropſies, Jaundice, Gout, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bleeding muſt be abſtained from with the utmoſt caution, as it will, inſtead of relieving, greatly aggravate thoſe diſtempers.</p>

               <p>TAKE two ſcruples of calcined Egg-ſhells, three times in a day, in a glaſs of any convenient liquor, drinking after each doſe, a third part of the following decoction: Take two ounces of Caſtile ſoap, diſſolve it in a quart of ſoft water, and ſweeten it according to your taſte, with Honey or Loaf ſugar. If this decoction is made in a cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per veſſel, care muſt be taken that it is well tinn'd. The taking of theſe medicines muſt be continued for ſome time after the complaint ceaſes, leſt any part of the Stone ſhould remain, which being rough and unequal might occaſion exquiſite pain. It is common after a few days uſe of theſe medicines, to have an increaſe of pain in making water, at which time, a ſoft diet, emollient drinks, and reſt, are proper. For common drink, milk and water, or a decoction of Marſhmallow roots, Parſley and Liquorice may be uſed; but if the perſon has been uſed to ſtrong liquors, ſmall punch made without acid may be drank ſparingly. Artichoaks, aſparagus, ſpinnage, lettuces, ſuccory, parſley, turnips, carrots, potatoes, radiſhes, peas, &amp;c. may be ſafely uſed, but onions, leeks and cellery, are to be preferred to all other vegetables.</p>
               <p>The patient ought to drink no more of any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor than is ſufficient to quench his thirſt, and he ſhould hold his water, as long as he can without great uneaſineſs, that it may have the longer time to act on the ſtone. If theſe medicines occaſion coſtiveneſs, it will be neceſſary now and then, at diſcretion, to take a doſe of Glauber's ſalt and Manna.</p>
