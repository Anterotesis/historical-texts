            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A PREFACE.</head>
            <p>READING the paper lately at breakfaſt, I ſaw an account of the ſplendid ceremonies uſed at Pitcairne Green, in Scotland, on marking the boundaries of an extenſive village to be erected on that ſpot, for the purpoſe of introducing the Lancaſhire manufactures. Theſe ceremonies were aſſiſted by all the perſons of conſequence, of each ſex, in that part of the kingdom;—amongſt the Ladies were Mrs. Graham, Lady C. Graham, &amp;c. &amp;c. As my eye ran it over, it dropt a tear on the paſſage. It muſt have appeared ridiculous enough, for there was certainly nothing very moving in it:—however, I have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to give both the tear and the feelings which made it ſtart, to the Genius of the place. I wrote merely to appeaſe my ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and having written (according to the old ſtory) my friends
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0999200400:4"/>
adviſed me to publiſh; and they are obeyed. If the public ſhould not find the trifle intereſting, they will at leaſt do it the juſtice to let it ſlide into oblivion, and forgive (I truſt) the few hours the compoſition coſt me.</p>
            <p>The little work has not been without its difficulties. My can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas was to hint a Landſcape—a Landſcape in a country which I had never ſeen. The accounts preſented by travellers might be falſe, or they might be invidious, yet <hi>they</hi> were to govern me! Notwithſtanding I yielded to this, images very diſſimilar crouded to my pen; the proſpects of Devon—dear native ſcenes! were for ever before me; and all my recollection was neceſſary, to prevent the tears of Dryades from falling for the loſs of their ſhades, and the Nightingale from pouring its regrets, that its ancient habitations were invaded.</p>
            <p>Had the ſcite of the intended village been in that province, deſcription would have had room to range;—fancy might have rioted, and the moſt luxuriant imagination ſated itſelf. There, a poet might have led his readers through verdant lanes (for ſo in other counties Devon's <hi>turnpikes</hi> would be named) where the high hedges compoſed of hawthorn, ſweet-brier, myrtle,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0999200400:5"/>
and a thouſand flowers, effectually ſcreens the traveller from the moſt ſultry ſun,—there, through the breaks, a country preſents itſelf, all enchantment! and where, if the Cottager did not boaſt views as delightful as the Nabob and the Patrician, the whole province might be miſtaken for one vaſt artificial pleaſure-ground. Whilſt the ear is filled with all the muſic, poured from the throats of the goldfinch, the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bird, and the thruſh, the eye inceſſantly wanders over painted meads, and roves from hill to dale—reſts on the ſoft foliage of ſloping woods, and purſues the ſerpentine of pellucid ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;—beholds fields of burniſhed corn waving like a golden ſea, to the tremulous breeze; and orchards loaden with ſuch fruit, as makes the ſtory of the Heſperides ſcarcely ſeem a fable.</p>
            <p>This little ſketch (literal, not poetical) is for the information of thoſe of my friends in Scotland, who have not yet croſſed the Tweed; and to ſuggeſt to them when they do, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn perſuaded of having ſeen the landſcapes of England, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they have travelled through Dorſetſhire, Somerſet, and DEVON.</p>

It has been told to me, that this village, and Doctor Goldſmith's will be contraſted—I earneſtly deprecate ſo fatal a compariſon! Goldſmith's is the poem of a Politician, and ſoars with a ſtrong wing!—mine is a butterfly fluttering over the field, and here and there repoſing on a cowſlip, or a daiſey. <hi>That</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from criticiſm by its magnitude; may <hi>this</hi> find ſafety in its littleneſs!</p>

               <l>Th' arreſted cataract a dome will form,</l>
               <l>And rapid torrents bound, in pillars riſe,</l>
               <l>Their capitals be ſculptur'd from a ſtorm—</l>
               <l>Snatch'd, as 'tis ruſhing from the Zemblian ſkies;</l>
               <l>On theſe the polar ſun will pour its beams,</l>
               <l>Tinting the glacid ſcene with ſhifting hues,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0999200400:26"/>
Now ſtrong, now fading into fainter gleams—</l>
               <l>And then at once, a ruddy blaze infuſe.</l>
               <l>Theſe are but outlines—an unſkilful ſketch;</l>
               <l>A powerful Barbauld muſt the ſhadings give—</l>
               <l>No colder genius on its utmoſt ſtretch,</l>
               <l>Can bid the frigid, cheerleſs landſchape live.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Attention tired with fancied ſcenes like theſe,</l>
               <l>Recoils, and wiſhes for familiar hours;</l>
               <l>Pants for the pillow'd chair, the robe of eaſe,</l>
               <l>And gladly yields to common life, its powers.</l>
               <l>What pen but BURNEY's then, can ſooth the breaſt?</l>
               <l>Who draw from nature with a ſkill ſo true?</l>
               <l>In ev'ry varying mode it ſtands confeſt,</l>
               <l>When brought by her before th' enquirer's view.</l>
               <l>A power <hi>peculiar,</hi> all her portraits fill.</l>
               <l>When lines are bold and ſtrong, a vulgar pen</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0999200400:27"/>
May take the ſketch; it aſks no mighty ſkill</l>
               <l>Miſers to paint, or mad, or wayward men.</l>
               <l>But human nature in its <hi>fainteſt</hi> dye</l>
               <l>Burney detects; drags it to open day—</l>
               <l>Makes evident what ſlip'd the unmarking eye,</l>
               <l>And bids it glare, with truth's pervading ray.</l>
               <l>The huddled beings of the common maſs,</l>
               <l>Who to themſelves appear of equal ſort,</l>
               <l>Muſt not in unawaken'd error paſs—</l>
               <l>And ſure 'tis this, is keen-ey'd Burney's fort!</l>
               <l>Touch'd by her ſpear, they ſudden ſpring to ſight,</l>
               <l>But not new form'd—ſhe ſhews them as they are;</l>
               <l>She <hi>molds</hi> no character, but gives the light</l>
               <l>Which makes them clear, as Herſchel ſees a ſtar!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yes, ſuch as theſe, thy plain may one day boaſt:</l>
               <l>Prize!—ſweet INTELLIGENCE, oh prize the change!</l>

Laurels will then ſurround our letter'd coaſt,</l>
               <l>And here, the muſes from Parnaſſus range.</l>
               <l>This vacant wild, till now expanſe unbleſt!</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Thus ſtopt the Sage;—the Genius paus'd awhile,</l>
               <l>As tho' his honied words revolving o'er;</l>

               <l>Which ſeem'd to promiſe ſhe would mourn no more,</l>
               <l>Then in ſweet tone—Oh man of ſnowy years!</l>
               <l>'Tis truth inſpires thee, and her force I own;</l>

'Tis ſhe hath chid away the falling tears,</l>

               <l>Yes! the CREAT GUARDIAN of the gen'ral weal</l>
               <l>Ne'er gives a mis'ry, but he ſends a cure;</l>
               <l>As herbs, their antidotes will e'er reveal,</l>
