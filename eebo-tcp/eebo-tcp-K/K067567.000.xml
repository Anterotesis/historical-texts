            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Have often thought that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaks to you, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s daughter did to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s mother, take this child, and nurſe it for me. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what a precious jewel is committed to your charge, what an advantage you have to ſhew your love to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to ſtock the next generation with noble plants, and what a joyful Account you may make, if you be faithful: Remember, ſouls, Chriſt and grace cannot be overvalued. I confeſs you have ſome diſadvantages, but let that only excite your diligence; the ſalvation of ſouls, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of your maſter, the greatneſs of your reward and everlaſting glory, will pay for all. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the devil is at work hard, wicked ones are induſtrious, and a corrupt nature is a rugged, knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty piece to hew: But be not diſcouraged: I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as much afraid of your lazineſs and unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as any thing. Do but go to work in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and who knows but that rough ſtone may prove a pillar in the temple of God? In the name of the
<pb facs="tcp:0844800300:4"/>living God, as you will anſwer it ſhortly at his bar, I command you to be faithful in inſtructing and catechizing your young ones; if you think I am too peremptory, I pray read the command from my maſter himſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> vi. 7. Is not the duty clear? and dare you neglect ſo direct a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand! Are the ſouls of your children of no value? Are you willing that they ſhould be brands of hell? Are you indifferent whether they be damned or ſaved? Shall the devil run away with them without controul? Will not you uſe your utmoſt endeavour to deliver them from the wrath to come? You ſee that they are not ſubjects uncapable of the grace of God; whatever you think of them, Chriſt doth not ſlight them; they are not too little to die, they are not too little to go to hell, they are not too little to ſerve their great maſter, too little to go to heaven; <hi>For of ſuch is the kingdom of God;</hi> and will not a poſſibility of their converſion and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, put you upon the greateſt diligence to teach them? Or are Chriſt and heaven, and ſalvation, ſmall things with you? if they be, then indeed I have done with you: but if they be not, I beſeech you lay about you with all your might; the devil knows your time is going apace, it will ſhortly be too late. O therefore what you do, do quickly, and do it I ſay, with all your might; O pray, pray, pray, and live holily before them, and take ſome time daily to ſpeak a little to your children, one by one, about their miſerable condition by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; I knew a child that was converted by this ſentence, from a godly ſchool-miſtreſs in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>Every mother's child of you are by nature child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath.</hi> Put your children upon learning their catechiſm, and the ſcriptures, and getting to pray and weep by themſelves after <hi>Chriſt:</hi> take
<pb facs="tcp:0844800300:5"/>heed of their company; take heed of pardoning a lye; take heed of letting them miſ-ſpend the ſabbath; put them, I beſeech you, upon imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating theſe ſweet children; let them read this book over an hundred times, and obſerve how they are <hi>effected,</hi> and aſk them what they think of thoſe children, and whether they would not be ſuch? and follow what you do with earneſt cries to God, and be in travel to ſee Chriſt formed in their ſouls. I have prayed for you, I have oft prayed for your children and I love them dearly; and I have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over theſe papers, that God would ſtrike in with them, and make them effectual to the good of their ſouls. Incourage your children to read this book, and lead them to improve it. What is preſented, is faithfully taken from experienced, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid chriſtians, ſome of them no way related to the children, who themſelves were eye and ear witneſſes of God's works of wonder; or from my own knowledge, or from reve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>PREFACE, Containing DIRECTIONS TO CHILDREN.</head>
                  <p>YOU may now hear (my dear lambs) what other good children have done, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how they wept and prayed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? how earneſtly they cried out for an intereſt in the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> may you now read how dutiful they were to their parents? how diligent at their books? how ready to learn the ſcripture and their catechiſms? Can you forget what queſtions they were wont to aſk? How much they feared a lye, how much they abhorred naughty company, how holy they live, how dearly they were loved, how joyfully they died?</p>
                  <p>But tell me, my dear children, and tell me truly, do you do as theſe children did? Did you ever ſee your miſerable ſtate by nature? Did you ever get by yourſelf and weep for ſin and pray for grace and pardon? Did you ever go to your father and mother, maſter, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and beg of them to pity you, and pray for you, and to teach you what you ſhall do to be ſaved, what you ſhall do to get Chriſt, heaven and glory? Doſt
<pb facs="tcp:0844800300:7"/>thou love to be taught good things? Come tell me truly, my dear child, for I would fain do what I can poſſibly to keep thee from falling into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire. I would fain have thee one of theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones, which Chriſt will take into his arms and bleſs. How doſt thou ſpend thy time? It is in play and idleneſs, and with wicked children? Dare you take God's name in vain, or ſwear, or tell a lye? Dare you do any thing which your parents forbid you, and neglect to do what they command you? Do you dare to run up and down upon the Lord's day? Or do you keep in to read your book, and to learn what your good parents command you? What do you ſay, child? Which of theſe two ſorts are you of? Let me talk a little with you, and aſk you a few queſtions.</p>

Did not their fathers and mothers, and every body that fears God, love them and praiſe them? What do you think is become of them, now they are dead and gone? Why, they are gone to heaven, and are ſinging hallelujahs with the angels: they ſee glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, and having nothing but joy and pleaſure, they ſhall never ſin any more, they ſhall never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>3.</hi> Whither, do you think, thoſe children go when they die, that will not do what they are bid, but play the truant, and lie, and ſpeak naughty words
<pb facs="tcp:0844800300:8"/>and break the ſabbath? Whither do ſuch children go, do you think? why, I will tell you, they which lie, muſt go to their father the devil into everlaſting burning; they which never pray, God will p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <item>
                        <hi>4.</hi> And are you willing to go to hell to be burned with the devil and his angels? Would you be in the ſame condition as naughty children? O hell is a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible place, that's worſe a thouſand times than whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, God's anger is worſe than your father's anger; and are you willing to anger God? O child, this is moſt certainly true, that all that be wicked and die ſo, muſt be turned into hell; and if any be once there, there is no coming out again.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>5.</hi> Would you not do any thing in the world rather than be thrown into hell fire? Would you not do any thing in the world to get Chriſt, grace and glory.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>6.</hi> Well now, what will you do? will you read this book a little, becauſe your good mother will make you do it, and becauſe it is a little new book, but as ſoon as ever you have done, run away to play, and never think of it?</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>7.</hi> How art thou now affected, poor child, in the reading of this book? Have you ſhed ever a tear ſince you began reading? Have you been by yourſelf upon your knees; and begging, that God would make you like thoſe bleſſed children? Or are you, as you uſed to be, as careleſs and fooliſh, and diſobedient, and wicked as ever?</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>8.</hi> Did you never hear of a little child that died? And if other children die, why may not you be ſick and die? And what will you do then, child, if you ſhould have no grace in your heart, and be found like other naughty children?</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>9.</hi> How do you know but that you may be the next child that may die? And where are you then if you be not God's child?</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>10.</hi> Wilt thou tarry any longer, my dear child, before thou run into thy chamber, and beg of God to give thee Chriſt for thy ſoul, that thou mayſt not be undone for ever? Wilt thou get preſently into a corner to weep and pray? Methinks I ſee that pretty lamb begin to weep, and think of getting by himſelf, and will, as well as he can, cry unto the Lord, to make him one of thoſe little ones that go into the kingdom of heaven; methinks there ſtands a ſweet child, and there another, that are reſolved for Chriſt and for heaven: methinks that little boy looks as if he had a mind to learn good things: methinks I hear one ſay, well, I will never tell a lye more, I will never keep any naughty boys company more, they will teach me to ſwear, and they will ſpeak naughty words, they do not love God? I'll learn my cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, and get my mother to teach me to pray, and will go weep and cry to Chriſt, and will not be quiet till the Lord hath given me grace. O that's my brave child indeed?</item>

                        <hi>11.</hi> But will you not quickly forget your promiſe? Are you reſolved, by the ſtrength of Chriſt, to be a good child? Are you indeed? Nay, but are you indeed? Conſider, dear child, God calls you to remember your Creator in the days of your youth; and he takes it kindly when little ones come to him, and loves them dearly, and godly people, eſpecially parents, and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and miſtreſſes, they have no greater joy than to ſee their children walk in the way of truth.</item>

                  <p>Now tell me, my pretty dear child, what will you do? Shall I make you a book? Shall I pray for you, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you? Shall your good mother weep over you? And will not you make us all glad, by your turning quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:0844800300:10"/>to the Lord? Shall Chriſt tell you that he will love you? And will not you love him? Will you ſtrive to be like thoſe children? I am perſuaded that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to do good to the ſouls of ſome little children by theſe papers, becauſe he hath laid it ſo much upon my heart to pray for them, and over theſe papers, and through mercy I have already experienced, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this nature hath not been in vain.

                        <hi>EXAMPLE I.</hi> Of one eminently converted, between eight and nine years old, with an account of her life and death.</head>
                     <p>MRS. <hi>Sarah Howley,</hi> when ſhe was between eight and nine years old, was carried by her friends to hear a ſermon, where the miniſter preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>Mat.</hi> xi. 13. <hi>My yoke is eaſy, and my burden is light:</hi> in the applying of which ſcripture, this child was mightily awakened, and made deeply ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the condition of her ſoul, and her need of Chriſt; ſhe wept bitterly to think what a caſe ſhe was in; and went home and got by herſelf into a chamber, and upon her knees ſhe wept and cried to the Lord as well as ſhe could, which might eaſily be perceived by her eyes and countenance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. She was not contented at this, but ſhe got her little brother and ſiſter into a chamber with her, and told them of their condition by nature, and wept over them, and prayed with them and for them.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0844800300:14"/>3. After this ſhe heard another ſermon upon <hi>Prov.</hi> xxix. 1. <hi>He that, being often reproved, hardneth his heart, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy:</hi> at which ſhe was more affected than before, and was ſo exceeding ſollicitous about her ſoul, that ſhe ſpent a great part of the night in weeping and praying, and could ſcarce take any reſt day or night for ſome time together, deſiring with all her ſoul to eſcape from everlaſting flames, and to get an intereſt in the Lord Jeſus; O what ſhould ſhe do for Chriſt! what ſhould ſhe do to be ſaved?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. She gave herſelf much to attending upon the word preached, and ſtill continued very tender un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, greatly favouring what ſhe heard.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. She was very much in ſecret prayer, as might eaſily be perceived by thoſe who liſtened at the chamber door, and was uſually very importunate, full of tears.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. She could ſcarce ſpeak of ſin, or be ſpoke to, but her heart was ready to melt.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. She ſpent much time in reading the ſcripture, and a book called <hi>The beſt friend in the worſt of times;</hi> by which the work of God was much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted upon her ſoul, and was much directed by it how to get acquaintance with God, eſpecially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of that book. Another book that ſhe was much delighted with, was Mr. <hi>Swinnock</hi>'s <hi>Chriſtian Man's Calling,</hi> and by this ſhe was taught in this meaſure to make religion her buſineſs. The <hi>Spiritual Bee</hi> was a great companion of hers.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. She was exceeding dutiful to her parents, very loath to grieve them in the leaſt: and if ſhe had at any time (which was very rare) offended them ſhe would weep bitterly.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. She abhorred lying, and allowed herſelf in no known ſin.</p>
                     <p n="10">
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0844800300:15"/>10. She was very conſcientious in ſpending of time, and hated idleneſs, and ſpent her whole time either in praying, reading, inſtructing at her needle, at which ſhe was very ingenious.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. When ſhe was at ſchool, ſhe was eminent for her diligence, teachableneſs, meekneſs and modeſty, ſpeaking little; but when ſhe did ſpeak, it was uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſpiritual.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. She continued in this courſe of religious duties for ſome years together.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. When ſhe was about fourteen years old, ſhe brake a vein in her lungs (as is ſuppoſed) and oft did ſpit blood, yet did a little recover again, but had ſeveral dangerous relapſes.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. At the beginning of <hi>January</hi> laſt ſhe was taken very bad again, in which ſickneſs ſhe was in great diſtreſs of ſoul. When ſhe was firſt taken ſhe ſaid, O mother, pray, pray, pray for me, for Satan is ſo buſy that I cannot pray for myſelf; I ſee I am undone without Chriſt, and a pardon! O, I am undone unto all eternity!</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Her mother knowing how ſerious ſhe had been formerly, did a little wonder that ſhe ſhould be in ſuch agonies: upon which her mother aſked her what ſin it was that was ſo burthenſome to her ſpirits: O mother, ſaid ſhe, it is not any particular ſin of omiſſion or commiſſion, that ſticks ſo cloſe to my conſcience, as the ſin of my nature; without the blood of Chriſt, that will damn me.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Her mother aſked her, what ſhe ſhould pray for, for her; ſhe anſwered, That I may have a ſaving knowledge of ſin and Chriſt: and that I may have an aſſurance of God's love to my ſoul. Her mother aſked her why ſhe did ſpeak ſo little to the miniſter that came to her? She anſwered, that it was her duty with patience and ſilence to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0844800300:16"/>learn of them: and it was exceeding painful to her to ſpeak to any.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. One time when ſhe fell into a fit ſhe cried out, O I am going, I am going: but what ſhall I do to be ſaved? Sweet Lord Jeſus I will lye at thy feet, and if I periſh it ſhall be at the fountain of thy mercy.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. She was much afraid of preſumption, and dreaded a miſtake in the matters of her ſoul, and would be often putting up ejaculations to God, to deliver her from deceiving herſelf. To inſtance in one: Great and mighty God, give me faith and true faith, Lord, that I may not be a fooliſh virgin, having a lamp and no oyl.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. She would many times be laying hold upon the promiſes, and plead them in prayer. That in <hi>Mat.</hi> xi. 28.29. was much on her tongue, and no ſmall relief to her ſpirit. How many times would ſhe cry out, Lord, haſt thou not ſaid, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="20">20. Another time her father bid her be of good cheer, becauſe ſhe was going to a better father; at which ſhe was much affected, and ſaid, but how do I know that? I am a poor ſinner that wants aſſurance; O for aſſurance! It was ſtill her note, O for aſſurance. This was her great, earneſt and conſtant requeſt, to all that came to her, to beg aſſurance for her; and, poor heart, ſhe would look with ſo much eagerneſs upon them, as if ſhe deſired nothing in the world ſo much as that they would pity her, and help her with their prayers; never was poor creature more earneſt for any thing, than ſhe was for an aſſurance, and the light of God's countenance; O the piteous moan that ſhe would make! O the agonies that her ſoul was in!</p>
                     <p n="21">
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0844800300:17"/>21. Her mother aſked her, if God ſhould ſpare her life, how ſhe would live? Truly mother, ſaid ſhe, we have ſuch baſe hearts, that I cannot tell; we are apt to promiſe great things when we are ſick, but when we are recovered, we are as ready to forget our ſelves, and turn again unto folly; but I hope I ſhall be more careful of my time, and my ſoul, than I have been.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. She was full of natural affection to her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and very careful leſt her mother ſhould be tired out with much watching: her mother ſaid, how ſhall I bear parting with thee, when I have ſcarce dryed my eyes for thy brother? She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, the God of love ſupport and comfort you: it is but a little while, and we ſhall meet in glory, I hope. She being very weak, could ſpeak but little, therefore her mother ſaid, child, if thou haſt any comfort, lift up thy hand; which ſhe did.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. The Lord's day before that in which ſhe died, a kinſman of hers came to ſee her, and aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her, whether ſhe knew him; ſhe anſwered, yea, I know you, and I deſire you would learn to know Chriſt; you are young, but you know not how ſoon you may die; and O to die without Chriſt it is a fearful thing: O redeem time! O time, time, time, precious time! Being requeſted by him not to ſpend herſelf, ſhe ſaid, ſhe would fain do all the good ſhe could while ſhe lived, and when ſhe was dead too, if poſſible; upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ſhe deſired that a ſermon might be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the funeral concerning the preciouſneſs of time. O that young ones would now remember their creator!</p>
                     <p n="24">24. Some miniſters that came to her, did with earneſtneſs beg that the Lord would pleaſe to give her ſome token for good, that ſhe might go off
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0844800300:18"/>triumphing, and bills of the ſame nature were ſent to ſeveral churches.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. After ſhe had long waited for an anſwer of their prayers, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Well, I will venture my ſoul upon Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="26">26. She carried it with wonderful patience, and yet would often pray that the Lord would give her more patience, which the Lord anſwered to aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for conſidering the pains and agonies that ſhe was in, her patience was next to a wonder: Lord, Lord, give me patience, ſaid ſhe, that I may not diſhonour thee.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. Upon <hi>Thurſday,</hi> after long waiting, great fears, and many prayers, when all her friends thought ſhe had been paſt ſpeaking, to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhment of her friends ſhe broke forth thus, with a very audible voice, and chearful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: Lord, thou haſt promiſed, that whoſoever comes unto thee, thou wilt in no ways caſt out; Lord, I come unto thee, and ſurely thou wilt in no ways caſt me out. O ſo ſweet! O ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious is Jeſus! O, I have the ſweet and glorious Jeſus; he is ſweet, he is ſweet, he is ſweet! O the admirable love of God in ſending Chriſt! O free grace to a poor loſt creature! And thus ſhe ran on repeating many of theſe things an hundred times over; but her friends were ſo aſtoniſhed to ſee her in this divine rapture, and to hear ſuch gracious words, and her prayers and deſires ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that they could not write a quarter of what ſhe ſpoke.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. When her ſoul was thus raviſhed with the love of Chriſt, and her tongue ſo highly ingaged in the magnifying of God, her father, brethren and ſiſters, with others of the family, were called
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0844800300:19"/>to whom ſhe ſpake particularly, as her ſtrength would give leave. She gave her bible as a legacy to one of her brothers, and deſired him to uſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>EXAMPLE VI.</hi> Of a poor Child that was awakened when he was about five Years old.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. A Certain very poor child, that had a very bad father, but it was to be hoped a very good mother, was, by the providence of God, brought to the ſight of a godly friend of mine, who upon the firſt ſight of the child had a great pity for him, and took an affection to him, and had a mind to bring him up for Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. At the firſt he did with great ſweetneſs and kindneſs allure the child, by which means it was not long before he got a deep intereſt in the heart of the child, and he began to obey him with more readineſs than children uſually do their parents.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By this a door was opened for a farther work,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0844800300:37"/>and he had a greater advantage to inſtill ſpiritual principles into the ſoul of the child, which he was not wanting in, as the Lord gave opportunity, and the child was capable of.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It was not long before the Lord was pleaſed to ſtrike in with the ſpiritual exhortations of this good man, ſo that the child was brought to a liking of the things of God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He quickly learned great part of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly's catechiſm by heart, and that before he could read his primmer within book; and he took a great delight in learning his catechiſm.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. He was not only able to give a very good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his catechiſm, but he would anſwer ſuch queſtions as are not in the catechiſm, with greater underſtanding than could be expected from one of his age.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. He took great delight in diſcourſing about the things of God; and when my friend had been either praying or reading, expounding or repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſermons, he ſeemed very attentive, and ready to receive the truths of God, and would with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible gravity, diligence and affection wait till duties were ended, to the no ſmall joy and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them which obſerved him.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. He would aſk very excellent queſtions, and diſcourſe about the condition of his ſoul and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, and ſeemed mightily concerned what ſhould become of his ſoul when he ſhould dye: ſo that his diſcourſe made ſome chriſtians even to ſtand aſtoniſhed.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. He was greatly taken with the great kindneſs of Chriſt in dying for ſinners, and would be in tears at the mention of them; and ſeemed at a ſtrange rate to be affected with the unſpeakable love of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="10">
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0844800300:38"/>10. When no body had been ſpeaking to him, he would burſt out into tears, and being aſked the reaſon, he would ſay, that the very thoughts of Chriſt's love to ſinners in ſuffering for them, made him that he could not but cry.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Before he was ſix years old, he made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſecret duty; and when he prayed, it was with ſuch extraordinary meltings, that his eyes have looked red and ſore with weeping by himſelf for his ſins.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. He would be putting of Chriſtians upon ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual diſcourſe when he ſaw them, and ſeemed little ſatisfied unleſs they were talking of good things.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. It is evident, that this poor child's thoughts were very much buſied about the things of another world, for he would oftentimes be ſpeaking to his bed-follow at mid-night about the matters of his ſoul; and when he could not ſleep, he would take hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly conference to be ſweeter than his appointed reſt. This was his uſual cuſtom, and thus he would provoke and put forward an experienced chriſtian to ſpend waking hours in talk of God, and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting reſt.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Not long after this, his good mother dyed, which went very near his heart, for he greatly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured his mother.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. After the death of his mother, he would often repeat ſome of the promiſes that are made unto fatherleſs children, eſpecially that in <hi>Exod.</hi> xxii. 22. <hi>Ye ſhall not afflict any widow, or the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs child; if thou afflict them in any wiſe, and they cry at all unto me, I will ſurely hear their cry.</hi>—Theſe words he would often repeat with tears, and ſay, I am fatherleſs and mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs upon earth, yet if any wrong me, I have a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0844800300:39"/>in heaven who will take my part; to him I commit myſelf, and in him is all my truſt.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Thus he continued in a courſe of holy duties, living in the fear of God, and ſhewed wonderful grace for a child, and died ſweetly in the faith of Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>My friend is a judicious Chriſtian of many years experience, who was no ways related to him, but a conſtant eye and ear witneſs of his godly life, honourable and chearful death, from whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this information.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. A Very poor child of the pariſh of <hi>Newington-Butts,</hi> came begging to the door of a dear chriſtian friend of mine, in a moſt lamentable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but it pleaſed God to raiſe in the heart of my friend a great pity and tenderneſs towards this poor child, ſo that in charity he took him out of the ſtreets, whoſe parents were unknown, who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all in him to commend him to any one's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity but his miſery. My friend eyeing the glory of God, and the good of the immortal ſoul of this wretched creature, diſcharged the pariſh of the child, and took him as his own, deſigning to bring him up in the fear of the Lord. A noble piece of charity! And that which did make the kindneſs far the greater
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0844800300:40"/>was, that there ſeemed to be very little hopes of doing any good upon this child, for he was a very monſter of wickedneſs, and a thouſand times more miſerable and vile by his ſin, than by his poverty. He was running to hell as ſoon as he could go, and was old in naughtineſs when he was young in years; and one ſhall ſcarce hear of one ſo like the devil in his infancy, as this poor child was. What ſin was there (that his age was capable of) that he did not commit? What by the corruption of his nature, and the abominable example of little beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-boys, he was arrived to a ſtrange pitch of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.

                     <p n="2">2. But this ſin and miſery was but a ſtronger motive to that gracious man to pity him, and to do all that poſſibly he could to pluck this fire-brand out of the fire; and it was not long before the Lord was pleaſed to let him underſtand that he had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of everlaſting kindneſs upon the ſoul of this poor child; for no ſooner had this good man taken this creature into his houſe, but he prays for him. and labours with all his might to convince him of his miſerable condition by nature, and to teach him ſomething of God, the worth of his ſoul, and that eternity of glory or miſery that he was born to; and bleſſed be free grace, it was not long before the Lord was pleaſed to ſhew-him that it was himſelf which did put it into his heart to take in this child, that he might bring him up for Chriſt.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0844800300:44"/>of God and Chriſt, and practiſing holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, till the ſickneſs came into the houſe, with which the child was ſmitten; at his firſt ſickening the poor child was greatly amazed and afraid, and, though his pains were great, and his diſtemper very tedious, yet the ſenſe of his ſin, and the thought of the miſerable condition that he feared his ſoul was ſtill in, made his trouble ten times greater; he was in grievous agonies of ſpirit, and his former ſins ſtared him in the face, and made him tremble; the poiſon of God's arrows did even drink up his ſpirit; the ſenſe of ſin and wrath was ſo great, that he could not tell what in the world to do; the weight of God's diſpleaſure, and the thoughts of lying under it to all e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ernity, did even break him to pieces, and he did cry out very bitterly, what ſhould he do? he was a miſerable ſinner, and he feared that he ſhould go to hell; his ſins had been ſo great and ſo many, that there were no hopes for him. He was not by far ſo much concerned for his life, as for his ſoul, what would become of that for ever. Now the plague upon his body ſeemed nothing to that which was in his ſoul.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But in this great diſtreſs, the Lord was pleaſed to ſend one to take care of his ſoul, who urged to him the great and precious promiſes which were made to one in his condition, telling him, that there was enough in Chriſt for the chiefeſt of ſinners, and that he came to ſeek and ſave ſuch a loſt creature as he was. But this poor child found it a very difficult thing for him to believe that there was any mercy for ſuch a dreadful ſinner as he had been.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. He was made to cry out of himſelf, not only for his ſwearing and lying, and other outwardly notorious ſins; but he was in great horror for the ſin of his nature, for the vileneſs of his heart, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0844800300:45"/>original corruption under it; he was in ſo great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, that the trouble of his ſpirit made him in a great meaſure to forget the pains of his body.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. He did very particularly confeſs and bewail his ſins with tears; and ſome ſins ſo ſecret, that none in the world could charge him with.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. He would condemn himſelf for ſin, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to have no mercy, thought that there was not a greater ſinner in all <hi>London</hi> than himſelf, and he abhorred himſelf as the vileſt creature he knew.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. He did not only pray much, with ſtrong cries and tears himſelf, but he begged the prayers of Chriſtians for him.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. He would aſk chriſtians, whether they thought there were any hopes for him, and would beg of them to deal plainly with him, for he was greatly afraid of being deceived.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Being informed how willing and ready the Lord Jeſus was to accept of poor ſinners, upon their repentance and turning, and being counſelled to venture himſelf upon Chriſt for mercy and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſaid he would fain caſt himſelf upon Chriſt, but he could not but wonder how Chriſt ſhould be willing to die for ſuch a vile wretch as he was, and he found it one of the hardeſt things in the world to believe.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. But at laſt it pleaſed the Lord to give him ſome ſmall hopes that there might be mercy for him, for he had been the chiefeſt of ſinners; and, he was made to lay a little hold upon ſuch promiſes, as that, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aſt he was full of praiſe, and admiring of God,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0844800300:46"/>ſo that (to ſpeak in the words of a good man, that was an eye and an ear-witneſs) to the praiſe and glory of God be it ſpoken, the houſe at that day, for all the ſickneſs in it, was a little lower heaven, ſo full of joy and praiſe.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The child grew exceedingly in knowledge, experience, patience, humility, and ſelf-abhorrence; and he thought he could never ſpeak bad enough of himſelf, the name that he would call himſelf by, was a toad.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. And though he prayed before, yet now the Lord poured out upon him the ſpirit of prayer in an extraordinary manner, for one of his age; ſo that now he prayed more frequently, more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more ſpiritually than ever. O how eagerly would he beg to be waſhed in the blood of Jeſus! and that the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, that was over heaven and earth, and ſea, would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and forgive him all his ſins, and receive his ſoul into his kingdom. And what he ſpoke, it was with ſo much life and fervour of ſpirit, as that it filled the hearers with aſtoniſhment and joy.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. He had no ſmall ſenſe of the uſe and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Chriſt, and ſuch longings and breathings of his ſoul after him, that when mention had been made of Chriſt, he hath been ready almoſt to leap out of his bed for joy.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. When he was told, that if he ſhould reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he muſt not live as he liſt; but he muſt give up himſelf to Chriſt, and be his child and ſervant, bear his yoke, and be obedient unto his laws, and live a holy life, and take his croſs, and ſuffer mocking and reproach, it may be perſecution for his name ſake. Now, child (ſaid one to him) are you willing to have Chriſt upon ſuch terms? He ſignified his willingneſs by the earneſtneſs of his looks
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0844800300:47"/>and words, and the caſting up of his eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying, yes, with all my ſoul, the Lord help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, I will do this.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Yet he had many doubts, and fears, and was ever and anon harping upon that, that though he were willing, yet Chriſt he feared was not willing to accept him, becauſe of the greatneſs of his ſin; yet his hopes were greater than his fears.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. The <hi>Wedneſday</hi> before he died, the child lay as it were in a trance for about half an hour, in which time he thought he ſaw a viſion of angels: when he was out of his trance, he was a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, and aſked his nurſe, why ſhe did not let him go? Go whither, child, ſaid ſhe? Why along with thoſe brave gentlemen, ſaid he; but they told me, they would come and fetch me away for all you upon <hi>Friday</hi> next. And he doubled his words many times, upon <hi>Friday</hi> next thoſe brave gentlemen will come for me; and upon that day the child died joyfully.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. He was very thankful to his maſter, and very ſenſible of his great kindneſs in taking him up out of the ſtreets when he was a begging, and he admired at the goodneſs of God, which put it into the mind of a ſtranger to look upon, and to take ſuch fatherly care of ſuch a pitiful ſorry crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as he was. O my dear maſter, (ſaid he) I hope to ſee you in heaven, for I am ſure you will go thither. O bleſſed, bleſſed be God that made you to take pity upon me, for I might have died, and have gone to the devil, and have been damned for ever, if it had not been for you.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. The <hi>Thurſday</hi> before he died, he aſked a very godly friend of mine what he thought of his condition, and whither his ſoul was now going? for he ſaid he could not ſtill but fear, leſt he ſhould deceive dimſelf with falſe hopes; at which my friend
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0844800300:48"/>ſpoke to him thus: child, for all that I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to hold forth the grace of God in Chriſt to thy ſoul, and given you a warrant from the word of God, that Chriſt is as freely offered to you, as to any ſinner in the world; if thou art but willing to accept of him, thou mayeſt have Chriſt and all that thou doſt want, with him; and yet thou giveſt way to theſe thy doubtings and fears, as though I told thee nothing but lyes; thou ſayeſt, thou feareſt that Chriſt will not accept of thee, I fear thou art not heartily willing to accept of him. The child anſwered, indeed I am: why then child, if thou art unfeignedly willing to have Chriſt, I tell thee, he is a thouſand times more willing to have thee, and waſh thee, and ſave thee, than thou art to deſire it. And now at this time Chriſt offers himſelf freely to thee again, therefore receive him humbly by ſaith into thy heart, and bid him welcome, for he deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it: upon which words the Lord diſcovered his love to the child; and he gave a kind of leap in his bed, and ſnapped his fingers and thumb together with abundance of joy, as much as to ſay, well, yea, all is well, the match is made, Chriſt is willing, and I am willing too; and now Chriſt is mine, and I am his for ever. And from that time forward, in full joy and aſſurance of God's love, he continued earneſtly praiſing God, with deſiring to die, and be with Chriſt. And on Friday morning he ſweetly went to reſt, uſing that very expreſſion, <hi>Into thy hands, Lord, I commit my ſpirit.</hi> He died punctually at that time which he had ſpoke of, and in which he expected thoſe angels to come to him; he was not much above nine years old when he died.</p>
                     <p>This narrative I had from a judicious holy man, unrelated to him, who was an eye and ear-witneſs to all theſe things.</p>

I might add, that I have ſince that ſeen a godly gentleman out of the country, that did proteſt to me, that he had ſeen as much as that in a little one of the ſame age, who ſince that time I hear went ſweetly to heaven. Doth not the reverend Mr. <hi>Clarke,</hi> in his works, quote a child of two years old that looked towards heaven? Doth not credible hiſtory acquaint us with a martyr at ſeven years old, that was whipped almoſt to death, and never ſhed one tear, nor complained; and, at laſt had his head ſtruck off? I do not ſpeak of theſe as common matters, but record them amongſt thoſe ſtupendous acts of him that can as eaſily work wonders as not. What is too hard for the almighty? Hath God ſaid he will work no more wonders? I think moſt of God's works in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of converſion call for admiration: and I believe that ſilence, or rather praiſe, would better become ſaints, than queſtioning the truth of ſuch things; eſpecially, where an apparent Injury is thereby done to the intereſt of Chriſt, the honour of God's grace, and the reputation of ſo eminent a ſaint. I judge this ſufficient to ſatisfy moſt; as for others I trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not myſelf; if I may but promote the intereſt of Chriſt, and the good of ſouls, and give up my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with joy, it is enough. That the Lord would bleſs my endeavours to theſe ends, I beg the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb facs="tcp:0844800300:54"/>of all ſaints, and yours alſo, ſweet children that fear the Lord.

                           </gap>x,</hi> whoſe great care was to inſtil ſpiritual principles into him as ſoon as he was capable of underſtanding of them: whoſe endeavours the Lord was pleaſed to crown with the deſired ſucceſs: ſo that (to uſe the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a holy man concerning him) ſcarce-more could be expected or deſired from ſo little a one.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When he was ſcarce able to ſpeak plain, he ſeemed to have a very great awe and reverence of God upon his ſpirit, and a ſtrange ſenſe of the things of another world, as might eaſily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by thoſe ſerious and admirable queſtions which he would be oft aſking of thoſe chriſtians that he thought he might be bold with.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0844800300:56"/>3. The firſt thing that did moſt affect him, and make him endeavour to eſcape from the wrath to come, and to enquire what he ſhould do to be ſaved, was the death of a little brother; when he ſaw him without breath, and not able to ſpeak or ſtir, and when carried out of doors, and put into a pit-hole, he was greatly concerned, and aſked ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing queſtions about him; but that which was moſt affecting of himſelf and others, was whether he muſt die too, which being anſwered, it made ſuch a deep impreſſion upon him, that from that time forward he was exceeding ſerious, and this was when he was about four years old.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Now he was deſirous to know what he might do that he might live in another world, and what he muſt avoid, that he might not die for ever, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by his godly parents, he ſoon labours to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void whatſoever might diſpleaſe God; now tell him that any thing was ſinful, and that God would not have him to do it, and he is eaſily kept from it, and even at this time of day, the apprehenſions of God, and death, and eternity, laid ſuch a reſtraint upon him, that he would not, for a world, have told a lye.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He quickly learned to read exactly, and took ſuch pleaſure in reading of the ſcriptures and his catechiſm, and other good books, that it is ſcarce to be paralleled; he would naturally run to his book without bidding: when he came home from ſchool, and when other children of his age and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance were playing, he reckoned it his recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to being that which is good.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When he was in coats he would be aſking his maid ſerious queſtions, and praying her to teach him his catechiſm, or ſcriptures, or ſome good thing; common diſcourſe he took no delight in, but did moſt eagerly deſire to be ſucking in of the knowledge of the things of God, Chriſt, his ſoul, and another world.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0844800300:57"/>7. He was greatly taken with the reading of the book of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and would be ready to leave his dinner to go to his book.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. He was exceeding careful of redceming and improving of time; ſcarce a moment of it but he would give an excellent account of the expence of it; ſo that this child might have taught elder per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and will queſtionleſs condemn their idle and unaccountable waſting of thoſe precious hours in which they ſhould, as this ſweet child, have been laying in proviſion for eternity.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. He could not endure to read any thing over ſlightly, but whatſoever he read, he dwelt upon it, laboured to underſtand it thoroughly, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it; and what he could not underſtand, he would oft aſk his father or mother the meaning of it.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. When any chriſtian friends have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with his Father, if they began to talk any thing about religion, to be ſure they ſhould have his company, and of his own accord he would leave all to hear any thing of Chriſt, and crept as cloſe to them as he could, and liſten as affectionately, though it were for an hour or two. He was ſcarce ever known to expreſs the leaſt token of wearineſs while he was hearing any thing that was good, and ſometimes when neighbours children would come and call him out, and entice him, and beg of him to go with them, he could by no means be perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though he might have had the leave of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, if he had any hopes that any good boy would come into his father's houſe.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. He was very modeſt whilſt any ſtranger was preſent, and was loth to aſk them any queſtions: but as ſoon as they were gone, he would let his father know, that there was little ſaid or done but he obſerved it, and would reflect upon what was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0844800300:58"/>paſt in their diſcourſe, and deſire ſatisfaction in what he could not underſtand at preſent.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. He was a boy of moſt prodigious parts for his age, as will appear from his ſolid and rational queſtions; I ſhall mention but two of many</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The firſt was this, when he was reading by himſelf in <hi>Draiton</hi>'s poems about <hi>Noah</hi>'s flood and the ark, he aſked who built the ark? It being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered it was likely that <hi>Noah</hi> hired men to help him to build it: and would they (ſaid he) build an ark to ſave another, and not go into it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Another queſtion he put was this: whether had a greater glory, ſaints or angels? It being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that angels were the moſt excellent of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and 'tis to be thought their nature is made capable of greater glory than man's, he ſaid he was of another mind, and his reaſon was, becauſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were ſervants, and ſaints are children; and that Chriſt never took upon him the nature of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but he took upon him the nature of ſaints, and by being man, he hath advanced human nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the nature of angels.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. By this you may perceive the greatneſs of his parts, and the bent of his thoughts, and thus he continued for ſeveral years together, labouring to get more and more ſpiritual knowledge, and to prepare for an endleſs life.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. He was a child of an excellent ſweet tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, wonderful dutiful to his parents, ready and joyful to do what he was bid, and by no means would do any thing to diſpleaſe them, and if they were at any time ſeemingly angry, he would not ſtir from them till they were thoroughly reconciled to him.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. He was not only good himſelf, but would do what he could to make others ſo too, eſpecially thoſe that were neareſt to him; he was very watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0844800300:59"/>over his brethren and ſiſters, and would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to uſe any unhandſome words, or to do any unhandſome action; but he would be putting them upon that which was good, and when he did at any time rebuke them, it was not childiſhly and ſlightly, but with great gravity and ſeriouſneſs, as one that was not a little concerned for God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the eternal welfare of their ſouls.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. He would go to his father and mother with great tenderneſs and compaſſion (being far from telling of tales) and beg of them to take more care of the ſouls of his brethren and ſiſters, and to take heed leſt they ſhould go on in a ſinful Chriſtleſs ſtate, and prove their ſorrow and ſhame, and go to hell when they die, and be ruined for ever.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. He was exceedingly affected with hearing of the word of God preached, and could not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied except he could carry home much of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what he heard; to this end he quickly got to learn ſhort-hand, and would give a very pretty account of any ſermon that he heard.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. He was much engaged in ſecret duty, and in reading the ſcriptures; to be ſure morning and evening he would be by himſelf, and was, no queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wreſtling with God.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. He would get choice ſcriptures by heart, and was very perfect at his catechiſm.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. The providences of God were not paſſed by without conſiderable obſervation by him.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. In the time of the plague he was exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned about his ſoul and everlaſting ſtate; very much by himſelf upon his knees. This prayer was found written in ſhort-hand after his death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>O Lord God and merciful Father, take pity upon me a miſerable ſinner, and ſtrengthen me, O Lord, in thy faith, and make me one of thy glorious ſaints in heaven. O Lord keep me from this poiſonous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;

O Lord, I have ſinned againſt thee, Lord pardon my ſins; I had been in hell long ago if it had not been for thy mercy; O Lord, I pray thee to keep my parents in thy truth, and ſave them from this infection, if it be thy will, that they may live to bring me up in thy truth: O Lord I pray thee ſtay this infection that rageth in this city, and pardon their ſins, and try them once more, and ſee if they will turn unto thee. Save me O Lord from this infection, that I may live to praiſe and glorify thy name; but, O Lord, if thou haſt appointed me to die of it, fit me for death, that I may die with comfort; and O Lord I pray thee to help me to bear up under all afflictions for Chriſt his ſake.</hi> Amen.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. He was not a little concerned for the whole nation, and begged that God would pardon the ſins of this land, and bring it nearer to himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. About the beginning of <hi>November</hi> 1665, this ſweet child was ſmote with the diſtemper, but he carried it with admirable patience under the hand of God.</p>

                     <p n="28">28. An hour and an half before his death, the ſame miniſter came again to viſit him, and aſked him, <hi>art thou not afraid to die?</hi> He anſwered; <hi>no, if the Lord will but comfort me in that hour.</hi> But, ſaid the miniſter, <hi>how canſt thou expect comfort, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we deſerve none?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>no, if I had my deſerts I had been in hell long ago.

                     <p n="31">31. After ſome reſt, her father aſked her again how ſhe did, and began to expreſs ſomewhat of the ſatisfaction and joy that he had taken in her former diligence in her reading the ſcriptures, and writing and her dutifulneſs, and that great progreſs that ſhe had made in the things of God, upon which ſhe humbly and ſweetly deſired to own God and his kindneſs in her godly education, and ſaid, that ſhe eſteemed her holy education under ſuch parents and miniſters as a greater portion than ten thouſand gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for thereby I have learned to comfort myſelf out of the word of God, which the world beſides could never have afforded.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. Her father perceiving her to grow very weak ſaid, I perceive child thou art very weak: It is true Sir (ſaid ſhe) I feel my weakneſs increaſing, and I ſee your ſorrow increaſing too, which is a piece of my affliction; be content I pray you, it is the Lord which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0844800300:75"/>doth it, and let you and I ſay with <hi>David, Let us fall into the Lord's hands, for his mercies are great.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="33">33. She had laid a great charge upon her parents not to be over-grieved for her after her death, urging that of <hi>David</hi> upon them, while the child was ſick, he faſted and wept, but when it died, he waſhed his face, and ſate up and eat, and ſaid, <hi>Can I bring him back again from death, I ſhall go to him but he ſhall not return to me.</hi> So ought you to ſay after my death, our child is well, for we know it ſhall be well with them that truſt in the Lord. She did lay a more particular and ſtrict charge upon her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying to her, Dear mother, who have done ſo much for me, you muſt promiſe me one thing before I die; and that is, that you will not ſorrow over-much for me: I ſpeak thus to you, becauſe I am afraid of your great affliction: conſider others loſſes, what they have been; remember <hi>Job;</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not what Chriſt foretold, <hi>In the world you ſhall have tribulation, but be of good cheer, in me you ſhall have peace:</hi> and muſt the apoſtles ſuffer ſo great tribulation, and muſt we ſuffer none? Did not Jeſus Chriſt, my only life and ſaviour, ſweat drops of blood? Was he not in a bitter agony, mocked, ſpit at, nailed to the croſs, and a ſpear thruſt through his bleſſed ſide, and all this for my ſake, and on the account of my ſins? Did not he cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Did not Chriſt hang naked upon the croſs, to purchaſe for me the garments of ſalvation, and to cloath me with his righteouſneſs, for there is ſalvation in no other name.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. Being very feeble and weak, ſhe ſaid, O if I might quietly ſleep in the boſom of Jeſus! and that till then he would ſtrengthen me! O that he would take me into his arms, as he did thoſe little ones, when he ſaid, <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me, for of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven; and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0844800300:76"/>he took them into his arms, and laid his lands on them and bleſſed them.</hi> I lie here as a child, O Lord, I am thy child, receive me into thy gracious arms. O Lord, Grace! Grace! and not Juſtice! for if thou ſhouldſt enter into judgment with me, I cannot ſtand, yea, none living ſhould be juſt in thy ſight.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. After this, ſhe cried out, O how faint am I! but fearing leſt ſhe ſhould diſhearten her mother, ſhe ſaid, While there is life, there is hope: if it ſhould pleaſe the Lord to recover me, how careful would I be to pleaſe you in my work and learning, and whatſoever you ſhould require of me!</p>
                     <p n="36">36. After this, the Lord did again ſend her ſtrength, and ſhe laboured to ſpend it all for Chriſt, in the awakening, edifying and comforting of thoſe that were about her; but her chiefeſt endeavour was to ſupport her dear parents from extraordinary ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and to comfort them out of the ſcriptures, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them that ſhe knew that <hi>all things did work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the good of them that did love God, even to thoſe which are called according to his purpoſe. O God, eſtabliſh me with thy free ſpirit! Who ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us from the love of Chriſt? I am perſuaded that neither life, nor death, nor angels, nor princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor heighth, nor depth, nor any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God, which is towards us in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord. My ſheep</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, and I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, and no man ſhall pluck them out of my hands. My father who gave them me is greater than all, and none ſhall pluck them out of my father's hands.</hi> Thus ſhe ſeemed to attain a holy confidence in God, and an aſſurance of her ſtate as to another world.</p>
                     <p n="37">37. When ſhe had a little refreſhed herſelf with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0844800300:77"/>reſt, ſhe burſt forth with abundance of joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, with a holy triumph of faith, ſaying, Death is ſwallowed up in victory, <hi>O death where is thy ſting? O grave where is thy victory? the ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the law; but thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="38">38. That ſhe might the better ſupport her friends, ſhe ſtill inſiſted upon that which might take off ſome of their burthen, by urging the neceſſity of death: <hi>We are from the earth, and to the earth we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: duſt is the mother of us all, the duſt ſhall turn to duſt, from whence it is; and the ſpirit to God who gave it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="39">39. Then ſhe diſcourſed of the ſhortneſs of man's life. O what is the life of man! <hi>The days of man upon the earth are as the graſs, and the flowers of the field, ſo he flouriſheth; the wind paſſeth over it, and it is gone, and his place knows him no more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="40">40. She further urged the ſin and ſorrow that did attend us in this life, and the longer we live, the more we ſin; now the Lord will free me from that ſin and ſorrow. We know not the thoughts of God, yet do we know ſo much, that they are mercy and peace, and do give an expected end. But what ſhall I ſay, my life ſhall not continue long, I feel much weakneſs. O Lord, look upon me graciouſly, have pity upon my weak diſtreſſed heart. I am oppreſſed, undertake for me, that I may ſtand faſt and overcome.</p>
                     <p n="41">41. She was very frequent in ſpiritual ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and it was no ſmall comfort to her, that the Lord Chriſt did pray for her, and promiſe to ſend his ſpirit to comfort her. It is ſaid (ſaid ſhe) <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</hi> O let him not leave me! O Lord continue with me till thy work be finiſhed.</p>
                     <p n="42">
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0844800300:78"/>42. She had very low and undervaluing thoughts of herſelf, and her own righteouſneſs; or elſe what meant her crying out in ſuch language as that, none but Chriſt! without thee I can do nothing? Chriſt is the true vine! O let me be a branch of that vine: what poor worms are we! O dear father, how lame and halting do we go in the ways of God and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? We know but in part, but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is imperfect ſhall be done away. O that I had attained to that now: But, what are we ourſelves? not only weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and nothingneſs, but wickedneſs. For all the thoughts and imaginations of man's heart are only evil, and that continually: we are, by nature, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, and are conceived and born in ſin and unrighteouſneſs. Oh! this wretched and vile thing ſin! but thanks to God, who hath redeemed me from it.</p>
                     <p n="43">43. She comforted herſelf and her father in that excellent ſcripture, Rom. viii 15, 16, 17. <hi>Ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the ſpirit of adoption, by which ye cry</hi> Abba Father. <hi>It is the ſpirit that witneſſeth with our ſpirits, that we are the children of God; and if children, then we are heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chriſt.</hi> You ſee thence, father, that I ſhall be a fellow-heir with Chriſt, who hath ſaid, <hi>in my Father's houſe are many manſions, if it were not ſo, I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again and take you to myſelf, that where I am there ye may be alſo.</hi> O Lord, take me to thyſelf. Behold, dear mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he hath prepared a place and dwelling for me.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. Yea, my dear child, ſaid her mother, he ſhall ſtrengthen you with his holy ſpirit, until he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0844800300:79"/>hath fitted and prepared you fully for that place which he hath provided for you.</p>
                     <p n="45">45. Yea, mother, it is ſaid in Pſalm lxxxiv. <hi>How lovely are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hoſts, my ſould doth thirſt for the courts of the Lord: one day in thy courts is better than a thouſand; yea, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a door-keeper in the houſe of God, than dwell in the tents of the wicked.</hi> Read that pſalm, dear mother, wherewith we may comfort one another. As for me, I am more and more ſpent, and draw near my laſt hour.</p>
                     <p n="46">46. Then ſhe deſired to be prayed with, and begged that the Lord would give her an eaſy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
                     <p n="47">47. After this ſhe turned to her mother, and, with much affection, ſhe ſaid, ah my dear and loving mother, that which cometh from the heart, doth ordinarily go to the heart, once more come and kiſs me before I leave you.</p>
                     <p n="48">48. She was not a little concerned about the ſouls of the reſt of her relations, and did particularly charge it upon her father to do what he could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to bring them up in the ways of God. O let my ſiſter be trained up in the ſcriptures, and cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing, as I have been.</p>
                     <p n="49">49. I formerly wept for my ſiſter, thinking that ſhe would die before me, and now ſhe weepeth for me, and then ſhe kiſſed her weeping ſiſter; alſo ſhe took her young little ſiſter in her arms, a child of ſix months old, and ſhe kiſſed it with much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as if her very bowels had moved within her, and ſpoke with many heart-breaking words, both to her parents and the children.</p>
                     <p n="50">50. Her father ſpake to one that was by, to take the poor little child away from her, from the hazard of that fiery diſtemper, and bid his daughter
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0844800300:80"/>to give her to them, for he had already too much to bear. Well father, ſaid ſhe, did not God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the three children in the fiery furnace; and did you not teach me that ſcripture? <hi>when thou paſſeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="51">51. She had a very ſtrong faith in the doctrine of the reſurrection, and did greatly ſolace her ſoul with excellent ſcriptures, which do ſpeak the happy ſtate of believers, as ſoon as their ſouls are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their bodies, and what ſhe quoted out of the ſcripture, ſhe did excellently and ſuitably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to her own uſe, incomparably above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reach of her ſex and age. That in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 42. was a good ſupport to her, <hi>The body is ſown in corruption, but it ſhall be raiſed incorruptible; it is ſown in diſhonour, it ſhall be raiſed in glory; it is ſown in weakneſs, but it ſhall be raiſed in power.</hi> And then ſhe ſweetly applies it, and takes in this cordial. Behold, thus it is, and thus it ſhall be with my mortal fleſh, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord, becauſe they reſt from their labours, and their works do follow them. The righteous periſh, and no man layeth it to heart; and the upright are taken away, and no man regardeth it, that they are taken away from the evil to come, they ſhall enter into peace, they ſhall reſt in their beds every one who walked in their uprightneſs.</hi> Behold, now father, I ſhall reſt and ſleep in that bed-chamber.</p>
                     <p n="52">52. Then ſhe quoted <hi>Job</hi> xix. 25, 26, 27. <hi>I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter end upon the earth; and though after my ſkin, worms deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God; whom I ſhall ſee for myſelf, and my eyes ſhall behold, and not another's, though
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0844800300:81"/>my reins be conſumed within me.</hi> Behold now, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this very ſkin which you ſee, and this very fleſh which you ſee, ſhall be raiſed up again; and theſe very eyes which now are ſo dim, ſhall, on that day, ſee and behold my dear and precious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer albeit the worms eat up my fleſh, yet with theſe eyes ſhall I behold God, even I myſelf, and not another for me.</p>
                     <p n="53">53. Then ſhe quoted <hi>John</hi> v. 28. <hi>Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming in which all that are in their graves ſhall hear his voice, and come forth; thoſe that have done good unto the reſurrection of life.</hi> See, father, I ſhall riſe in that day, and then I ſhall behold my redeemer; then ſhall he ſay, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my father, inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you before the beginning of the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="54">54. <hi>Behold now I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and the life that I now live in the fleſh is by the faith of the ſon of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me. I am ſaved, and that not of myſelf, it is the gift of God, not of works, leaſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="55">55. My dear parents, now we muſt ſhortly part, my ſpeech faileth me, pray to the Lord for a quiet cloſe to my combat.</p>
                     <p n="56">56. Her parents replied, ah our dear child! How ſad is that to us, that we muſt part? ſhe anſwered, I go to heaven, and there we ſhall find one another again; I go to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="57">57. Then ſhe comforted herſelf to think of her ſeeing her precious brother and ſiſter again in glory. I go to my brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> who did ſo much cry and call upon God to the laſt moment of his breath: and to my little ſiſter, who was but three years old when ſhe died: who, when we aſked
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0844800300:82"/>her, whether ſhe would die? anſwered yes, if it be the Lord's will. I will go to my little brother if it be the Lord's will, or I will ſtay with my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be the Lord's will. But I know that I ſhall die, and go to heaven and to God. O ſee, how ſo ſmall a babe had ſo much given it, to be have itſelf every way, and in all things ſo ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to the will of God, as if it had no will of its own; but if it be the will of God, if it pleaſe God; nothing for her, but what was the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God; and therefore dear father and mother, give the Lord thanks for this his free and rich grace, and then I ſhall the more gladly be gone. Be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then, O Lord unto me alſo, be gracious to me, waſh me throughly from my unrighteouſneſs, and cleanſe me from my ſin.</p>
                     <p n="58">58. After this, her ſpirit was refreſhed with the ſenſe of the pardon of her ſins, which made her to cry out, behold, God hath waſhed away my ſins, O how do I long to die! The apoſtle ſaid, <hi>in this body we earneſtly ſigh and groan, longing for our houſe which is in heaven, that we may be cloathed therewith.</hi> Now I alſo lie here ſighing and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that dwelling which is above. In the laſt ſermon which I heard, or ever ſhall hear, I heard this, which is matter of great comfort unto me.</p>
                     <p n="59">59. Then ſhe repeated ſeveral notable ſcriptures which were quoted in that ſermon, afterward ſhe deſired to be prayed with, and put petitions into their mouths, <hi>viz.</hi> That all her ſins might be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, that ſhe might have more abundant faith, and the aſſurance of it; and the comfort of that aſſurance, and the continuation and ſtrength of that comfort, according as her neceſſity ſhould require. Afterwards ſhe prayed herſelf, and continued ſome time.</p>
                     <p n="60">
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0844800300:83"/>60. When prayers were ended, ſhe called to her father and mother, and demanded of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe had at any time angred or grieved them, or done any thing that did not become her? And begged of them to forgive her.</p>
                     <p n="61">61. They anſwered her, that if all children had carried themſelves ſo to their parents as ſhe had done, there would be leſs grief and ſorrow on all hands than there is; and if any ſuch thing had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped thee, we would forgive it with all our hearts, you have done as became a good child.</p>
                     <p n="62">62. Her heart being comforted with her peace with God and he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> parents, ſhe began to diſpoſe of her books; particularly ſhe intreated her mother to keep Mr. <hi>De Wit</hi>'s catechiſe lectures, as long as ſhe lived, for her ſake, and let my little ſiſter have my other books, in remembrance of me.</p>
                     <p n="63">63. Then, ſhe ſaid, ſhe felt her breaſt exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pained, by which ſhe knew that her end was very nigh. Her father ſpake to her as he was able, telling her, the Lord would be her ſtrength in the hour of her neceſſity.</p>
                     <p n="64">64. Yea, (ſaid ſhe) <hi>The Lord is my ſhepherd, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I paſs through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will not fear, for thou art with me, thy rod and thy ſtaff, they comfort me:</hi> And it is ſaid, <hi>the ſufferings of this preſent life are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> Shall I not ſuffer and endure, ſeeing my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious redeemer was pleaſed to ſuffer ſo much for me? O how was he mocked and crowned with thorns, that he might purchaſe a crown of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for us: And that is the crown of which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke, when he ſaid, <hi>I have fought the good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0844800300:84"/>which the Lord, the righteous judge ſhall give unto me in that day; and not only to me, but to all who love his appearing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="65">65. <hi>Ye are bought with a price, therefore glorify God with your ſouls and bodies, which are his.</hi> Muſt I not then exalt and bleſs him while I have a being, who hath bought me with his blood? <hi>Surely he hath born our griefs, and took our infirmities, and we eſteemed him ſmitten and ſtricken of God; But he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our ſins: The chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and by his ſtripes are we healed, and the Lord laid upon him the iniquity of us all. Behold the lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world:</hi> that lamb is Jeſus Chriſt who hath ſatisfied for my ſins. So ſaith Paul, <hi>Ye are waſhed, ye are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ye are juſtified in the name of our Lord Jeſus, and through the ſpirit of our God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="66">66. My end is now very near, now I ſhall put on white raiment, and be cloathed before the lamb, that ſpotleſs lamb, and with his ſpotleſs righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Now are the angels making ready to carry my ſoul before the throne of God. <hi>Theſe are they who are come out of great tribulation, who have waſhed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="67">67. She ſpoke this with a dying voice, but full of ſpirit, and of the power of faith.</p>
                     <p n="68">68. Her lively aſſurance ſhe further uttered in the words of the apoſtle; <hi>We know that if this earthly houſe of our tabernacle be diſſolved, we have one which is built of God, which is eternal in the heavens; for in this we ſight for our houſe, which is in heaven, that we may be cloathed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</hi>

                        <hi>EXAMPLE XII.</hi> Of the excellent carriage of a Child upon his death-bed, when but ſeven years old.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>JAcob Bicks,</hi> the brother of <hi>Suſanna Bicks,</hi> was born in <hi>Leiden;</hi> and had a religious educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under his godly parents, the which the Lord was pleaſed to ſanctify to his converſion, and by it lay in excellent proviſions to live upon in an hour of diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This ſweet little child was viſited of the Lord of a very ſore ſickneſs three or four weeks before his ſiſter, of whoſe life and death we have given you ſome account already: in his diſtemper he was for the moſt part very ſleepy and drowſy, till near his death, but when he did awake, he was wont to be much engaged in prayer.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0844800300:86"/>3. Once when his parents had been praying with him, they aſked him again if they ſhould ſend for the phyſician? No (ſaid he) I will have the doctor no more; the Lord will help me: I know he will take me to himſelf, and then he ſhall help all.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Ah my dear child, ſaid his father, that grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth my heart: Well (ſaid the child) father, let us pray, and the Lord ſhall be near for my helper.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. When his parents had prayed with him again, he ſaid, come now dear father and mother, and kiſs me, I know that I ſhall die.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Farewell, dear father and mother, farewell dear ſiſter, farewell all. Now ſhall I go to heaven unto God and Jeſus Chriſt, and the holy angels: Father, know you not what is ſaid by <hi>Jeremiah: Bleſſed is he who truſteth in the Lord?</hi> Now I truſt in him, and he will bleſs me. And in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. it is ſaid, <hi>Little children love not the world, for the world paſſeth away.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Away then all that is in the world, away with all my pleaſant things in the world: away with my dagger, for where I go, there is nothing to do with daggers and ſwords: men ſhall not fight there, but praiſe God. Away with all my books; there ſhall I know ſufficiently, and be learned in all things of true wiſdom, without books.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. His father being touched to hear his child ſpeak at this rate, could not well tell what to ſay; but, my dear child, the Lord will be near thee, and uphold thee.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Yea, father (ſaid he) the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, but he giveth grace to the humble.</hi> I ſhall humble myſelf under the mighty hand of God, and he ſhall help me and lift me up.</p>

                     <p n="11">11. Yes, ſaid the child, God hath given me ſo ſtrong a faith upon himſelf, through Jeſus Chriſt, that the devil himſelf ſhall flee from me, for it is ſaid, <hi>He who believeth in the Son hath everlaſting life, and he hath overcome the wicked one.</hi> Now I believe in Jeſus Chriſt my redeemer, and he will not leave or forſake me, but ſhall give unto me eternal life, and then ſhall I ſing <hi>Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Sabbath.</hi>

                        <hi>EXAMPLE XIII.</hi> Of one that began to look towards heaven, when he was very young; with many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent paſſages of his life, and joyful death, when he was eleven years and three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters old.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>JOhn Harvey</hi> was born in <hi>London,</hi> in the year 1654, his father was a <hi>Dutch</hi> merchant; he was piouſly educated under his virtuous mother, and ſoon began to ſuck in divine things with no ſmall delight.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The firſt thing very obſervable in him was, that when he was two years and eight months old,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0844800300:88"/>he could ſpeak as well as other children do uſually at five years old.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. His parents judging, that he was then a little too young to ſend out to ſchool, let him have his liberty to play a little about home. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of playing, he found out a ſchool of his own accord hard by, and went to the ſchool miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, own accord hard by, and went to the ſchool miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and intreated her to teach him to read: and ſo he went for ſome time to ſchool without the knowledge of his parents, and made a very great progreſs in his learning, and was able to read diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly, before moſt children are able to know their letters.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He was wont to aſk many ſerious and weighty queſtions, about matters which concerned his ſoul and eternity.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. His mother being greatly troubled upon the death of one of his uncles, this child came to his mother, and ſaid, mother, though my uncle be dead, doth not the ſcriptures ſay, he muſt riſe again; yea, and I muſt die, and ſo muſt every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and it will not be long before Chriſt will come to judge the world, and then we ſhall ſee one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again, I pray mother, do not weep ſo much. This grave counſel he gave his mother, when he was not quite five years old, by which her ſorrow for her brother was turned into admiration at her child, and ſhe was made to ſit ſilent and quiet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſmarting ſtroke.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. After this, his parents removed to <hi>Aberdeen</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſettled their child under an able ſchool-maſter there, whoſe cuſtom was upon the Lord's day in the morning, to examine his ſcholars concerning the ſermons that they had heard the former Lord's day, and to add ſome other queſtions which might try the underſtanding and knowledge of his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0844800300:89"/>ſcholars. His maſter was often amazed at this child's anſwers, and took an opportunity to go to his mother, to thank her for inſtructing her ſon ſo well; but ſhe replied, that he improved in his underſtanding, not only by her inſtructions, but by his own reading and obſervation.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. He was a child that was extraordinary inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, and full of good queſtions, and very careful to obſerve and remember what he heard.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. He had a great hatred of whatſoever he knew to be diſpleaſing to God, and he was ſo greatly concerned for the honour of God, that he would be much diſpleaſed, if any groſs ſins were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before him. And he had a deep ſenſe of the worth of ſouls, and was not a little grieved when he ſaw any do that which he knew was dangerous to their ſouls.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. One day ſeeing one of his near relations come into his Father's houſe diſtempered with drink, as he thought, he quickly went very ſeriouſly to him, and wept over him, that he ſhould ſo offend God and hazard his ſoul, and begged of him to ſpend his time better than in drinking and gaming; and this he did, without any inſtruction from his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but from an inward principle of grace, and love to God and ſouls, as it is verily believed.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. When he was at play with other children, he would be oftentimes putting in ſome word to keep them from naughty talk, or wicked actions; and if any did take the Lord's name in vain, or do any thing unbecoming of a good child, they ſhould ſoon hear of it from him; nay, once hearing a boy ſpeak very profanely, and that after two or three ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions he would not forbear, nor go out of his company neither, he was ſo tranſported with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0844800300:90"/>zeal, that he could not forbear falling upon him, to beat him, but his mother chiding of him for it, he ſaid, that he could not endure to hear the name of God ſo abuſed by a wretched boy. This is obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to vindicate the act, but to take notice of his zeal.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. He was a child that took great delight in the company of good men, and eſpecially miniſters and ſcholars; and if he had any leiſure time, he would improve it by viſiting of ſuch, whoſe diſcourſe might make him wiſer and better; and when he was in their ſociety, to be ſure his talk was more like a chriſtian and a ſcholar than a child.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. One day after ſchool-time was over, he paid Mr. <hi>Andrew Kent</hi> (one of the miniſters of <hi>Aberdeen</hi>) a viſit, and aſked him ſeveral ſolid queſtions; but the good man aſked him ſome queſtions out of his catechiſm: and finding him not ſo ready in the anſwers as he ſhould have been, did a little reprove him, and told him, that he muſt be ſure to get his catechiſm perfectly by heart: the child took the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof very well, and went home and ſet very cloſe to his catechiſm, and never leſt it till he got it by heart; and not only ſo, but he would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the ſenſe and meaning of it.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. He was ſo greatly taken with his catechiſm, that he was not content to learn it himſelf, but he would be putting others upon learning it alſo, eſpecially thoſe that were neareſt to him; he could not be ſatisfied till he had perſuaded the ſervants to learn it, and when they were at work, he would be ſtill following them with ſome good queſtion or other; ſo that the child ſeemed to be taken up with the thoughts of his ſoul, God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the good of others.</p>
                     <p n="14">
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0844800300:91"/>14. He was a conſcientious obſerver of the Lord's day, ſpending all the time either in ſecret prayer, or reading the ſcriptures, and good books; learning of his catechiſm, and hearing of the word of God, and publick duties; and was not only careful in the performance of thoſe duties himſelf, but was ready to put all that he knew upon a ſtrict obſervation of the Lord's day, and was exceedingly grieved at the profanation of it. One Lord's day a ſervant of his father's going out of the houſe upon an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary occaſion, to fetch ſomething that was wanted, he took on ſo bitterly, that he could ſcarce be pacified, becauſe that holy day was ſo abuſed (as he judged) in his father's houſe.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. When he was between ſix and ſeven years old, it pleaſed God to afflict him with ſore eyes, which was no mall grief to him, becauſe it kept him from ſchool, which he loved as well as many boys do their play; and that which was worſe, he was commanded by the doctor not to read any book whatſoever at home. But O how was this poor child grieved, that he might not have liberty to read the holy ſcriptures! and for all their charge he would get by himſelf, and ſtand by the window and read the bible and other good books; yea, he was ſo greedy of reading the ſcriptures, and took ſo much delight in them, that he would ſcarce allow himſelf time to dreſs himſelf; for reading the word of God was his great delight. Yea, though he had been beat for ſtudying ſo much, yet judging it God's command that he ſhould give himſelf up to reading, he could not be beat off from it, till he was ſo bad that he had like never to have recovered his ſight more.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. It was his practice to be much by himſelf in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0844800300:92"/>ſecret prayer; and he was careful to manage that work, ſo as that it might be as ſecret as poſſibly it could be, but his frequency and conſtancy made it to be eaſily obſerved! upon which, one time one having a great mind to know what this ſweet babe prayed for, got into a place near him, and heard him very earneſtly praying for the church of God, deſiring that the kingdom of the goſpel might be ſpread over the whole world, and that the kingdom of grace might more and more come into the hearts of God's people, and that the kingdom of glory might be haſtened. He was wont to continue half an hour, ſometimes an hour, upon his knees to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. He was much above the vanities that moſt children are taken with, and was indeed too much above this world to live long in it.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. He was very humble and modeſt, and did by no means affect fineneſs in apparel, but hated any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than neceſſaries either in cloaths or diet.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. When he perceived either his brother or ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſed with their new cloaths, he would, with a great deal of gravity, reprove their folly, and when his reproof ſignified little, he would bewai their vanity.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. Once he had a new ſuit brought him, which, when he looked on, he found ſome rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons at the knees, at which he was grieved, aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mother, Whether thoſe things would keep him warm? No, child, ſaid his mother: Why then ſaid he, do you ſuffer them to be put here? you are miſtaken, if you think ſuch things pleaſe me: and, I doubt, ſome that are better than us, may wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
