            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Yet, my Lord, though the propriety is <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:1185300301:4"/>
ſtrong, though the taſk is indiſpenſible, though the ſubject warmly
gratifies my beſt pride, yet never was effort ſo uncommonly
difficult.—Great men have patronized public characters, and the
encouragement of genius has been, in many inſtances, the moſt brilliant
diſtinction of Engliſh nobility: but there is no example of ſuch an act
of beneficence as that which your Lordſhip has extended towards me. No

thoſe favours that have been conferred given from any ſuch noble motive, or

            <p>It was reſerved for your Lordſhip to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify patronage, by
blending ſolicitous condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion with ſpontaneous liberality.</p>
            <p>If then men of great and celebrated talents have found their

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THERE cannot be any thing 10 fallacious as the cavils of thoſe
authors who complain of being unjuſtly treated by the public. The judgment of
the public, like thoſe laws to which they owe their exiſtence, as a
reſpected and a happy people—ſpight of the factious few, whoſe
impotent clamour ſerves, as its ſhadow, to diſplay the light of
reaſon—never fails to decide firmly, yet indulgently; and nothing can
more completely confirm character and ſecurity, than the diſpaſſionate
determination of the one, and the unbiaſſed deciſion of the other.</p>
            <p>But, though the judgment of the public and the laws of the land
contain in themſelves all we know of reaſon and equity, yet nothing can be
ſo difficult as to make a fair appeal to either. The ſons of chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, in
both, ſo clog up the courſe, and ſo poiſon the air, that the career is
fatiguing and dangerous; <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:1185300301:7"/> and thus many, with fair
pretenſions, turn back, their purſuits and purpoſes unaccompliſhed, and
ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſign the honours of the race, than ſtrive to reach a deluſive
goal, to obtain an unavailing vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the painter, who had been ruined by going to law, without
bringing any thing to iſſue, had theſe ideas in his mind when he drew a
picture of juſtice, ſupported by hunger and thirſt.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall leave thoſe laws which the prudence of our
forefathers has eſtabliſhed for the ſecurity of property—which are,
in this country, a monument of ſober reflection, ſound wiſdom, and
ſolid judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which are, at this moment, diſpenſed by men of brilliant
talents, correct information, and invincible integrity, and which are only
inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient becauſe they are abuſed, inefficient becauſe their
eſſence is perverted, and oppreſſive becauſe they are held out as
ſnares for the good and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, by the wicked and the
worthleſs—and ſpeak of thoſe other laws which civilization has
eſtabliſhed <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:1185300301:8"/> for the ſecurity of fame, and which,
being of a wider extent, and without ſo decided a criterion, are productive
of much more ſportive miſchief than the others; both becauſe the
ſcribbling pettifoggers have warmer imaginations than the legal ones, and
becauſe their nefarious freaks, though full as raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, may be
exerciſed with impunity.</p>
            <p>According to this, illicit lawyers—for I really ought to
make this diſtinction—ſo they poſſeſs a plentiful ſtock of
cunning and craft, need not be overburdened with intellects; but this is not
the caſe with the other claſs. Illicit writers cannot combat opinions
without ſome ſtock of general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; their competitors being men of
abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and thus it happens, that as you may call a lawyer a dunce and
welcome, ſo you do not call him a rogue, ſo you may call a ſcribbler a
rogue and welcome, ſo you do not call him a dunce: which is like Foote's
ſtroke at a ſociety who ſometime ago ſet themſelves up as reformers,
under the appellation of The Chriſtian Club.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1185300301:9"/> Having talked of hanging, and being told that
ſuch an inſinuation would give offence, for that a brother of one of the
members had been hanged, he changes his ground, and talks of damning.— 
<q rend="inline">'That is right,' ſays the other, 'damn as much
as you pleaſe; for though the Chriſtian club may have ſome fears of the
gallows, they do not value damnation of a braſs farthing!'</q>
            </p>
            <p>The truth of this diſtinction which I have made will, I think,
be pretty clearly eſtabliſhed, by a conſideration that the traffic of the
lawyers depends on certain things called goods, chattles, houſes,
hereditaments—in ſhort any thing that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed—whereas
the ſcribblers cannot always convey the object of their traffic, even in
idea. A lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poon is not attachable; or, if it were, it would be of no value.
There is nothing tangible in a modern Pindaric ode; or, if there were, as
Shakeſpeare has it, 
<q rend="inline">'Thoſe that touch pitch will be defiled.'</q>
Nor can poor Priſcian bring his action of battery, though we ſee his head
broken every day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:1185300301:10"/> Thus, while they ſteer clear of hitting the
man, they may diſcharge whole vollies of their pointleſs arrows at the
writer with ſafety. He has no objection to their picking up their crumbs at
his expence. The ſun nurtures myriads of inſects, that at once inhale
poiſon and preſervation from his genial influence.</p>
            <p>As I certainly allude to the abuſe with which, in my life, I
have been ſo foully beſpattered, it ſhould ſeem as if I had drawn this
concluſion with a view to announce myſelf a man of genius. Were I ſo
weak, I ſhould be in a lamentable error indeed. For an author, with the
ſmalleſt pretenſions to fame, I ought by this time to have been abuſed
ten times more than I have; unleſs indeed I rate the quality of the abuſe
in addition to the quantity, and ſo, by throwing one lump of invidious
raſcality into the ſcale, make it preponderate in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>I am afraid however I am not ſo lucky; for, in this caſe, I
muſt take in the idea that the ſlander <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1185300301:11"/> of a rogue is a
compliment to an honeſt man: and I have already ſaid, that every thing
beyond literary defamation is here out of the queſtion. I have therefore
nothing left for it but a comparative view of that abuſe which has been
levelled at others and myſelf, and, upon that enumeration, I ſhall be
driven to eſtimate my own labours at that humble rate which the public will
always give its due praiſe, but which aſpires at nothing more.</p>
            <p>To begin with the ancients. Has any writer ſuſtained more rank
and foul abuſe than Homer? who, after all, is ſo juſtly ſtyled the
father of poetry: and if they began with the father, no wonder they have ſo
completely gone through all the family.—It has been ſaid that the
muſes themſelves ſet him up a rival in Heſiod, whom they invited to
reſide with them on Mount Helicon, and, that they might initiate him into all
their myſteries, actually took him into their ſervice, and endowed him with
their own celeſtial genius. Tutored thus by his heavenly
inſtructreſſes, he is ſaid to have won a tripod from Homer at a
poetical controverſy at Chalcis; but <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1185300301:12"/> Alexander laughs
at this buſineſs, conſtruing it into a compliment to Homer, and ſaying
that Heſiod might well win a prize from Homer, when not kings, but peaſants
were the judges.</p>
            <p>When you come to Virgil, theſe candid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters allow nothing
more than that he was the tranſlator and imitator of Homer; to prove which,
they inſtance his ſending Aeneas to hell, in poſitive imitation of the
Odyſſey, the converſation of the gods, the games, the ſhips, and many
other things. But what ſort of an imitator of Homer muſt he have been if it
be true, as Le Mercier informs us, that Homer wrote neither the Iliad nor the
Odyſſey!—but that they were compiled from the works of all the
eminent writers of that time; impreſſing very ſtrongly an idea that Homer
was merely a ballad ſinger, and that he invented nothing, but only
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated the Grub-ſtreet doctrine of Greece.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid alſo that Virgil imitated Heſiod in his georgics,
and Theocritus in his paſtorals. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence too is ſaid to have been no more
than the <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:1185300301:13"/> tranſlator of Plautus, Livy the imitator of
Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus, and Salluſt of Thucidides, who had before been imitated in his
writings—which, after all, were obſcure—by Zenephon, and in his
orations by Demoſthenes. Horace, they report, ſtole his art of poetry from
Ariſtotle's rhetoric; and, as to Ariſtotle himſelf, ſome have gone ſo
far as to queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whether we have any thing genuine of his at all, and they
offer the following circumſtance as a notable proof of this vague and
ſtrange opinion.</p>
            <p>Theophraſtus received, as a legacy, the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of
Ariſtotle. The heirs of Theophraſtus bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them in the ground, at
Scepſis, a town of Troas, to hide them from King Pergamus. Here they lay
concealed a hundred and ſixty years, and were, at the end of that time,
ſold to one Appelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, a rich citizen of Athens. They fell afterwards into
the hands of Sylla; after that they were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by Tyrannian, a
grammarian; and next they became the property of Andronicus, of Rhodes, who
firſt made them public about two hundred and fifty years after the death of
Ariſtotle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:1185300301:14"/> Thus, we have a Virgil who imitated a Homer,
who never was a writer!—and we have a Horace who ſtole from the works
of an Ariſtotle, which works it is inſinuated are ſpurious! But neither
is Zoilus himſelf, of Philadelphus, nor Le Mercier, the Zoilus of France, to
be put in the ſmalleſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with Father Ardouine, who, determined
to put the matter out of doubt, roundly aſſerts, upon his own ſingle
authority, that Homer, Virgil, and Horace were all forged by monks, in the
twelfth century!! Perhaps it was upon ſome occaſion like this that Paſcal
ſaid it was eaſier to find monks than reaſons.</p>
            <p>Thus go on theſe Ariſtarchuſes in criticiſm. The defenders
of Virgil, aſſuming great candour, tell us that they ſubſcribe to
thoſe charges brought againſt him, above mentioned, but that he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
excelled Heſiod. Juſtice however obliges them to confeſs that he fell
ſhort of Theocritus in the ſame proportion as the Latin is inferior to the
Greek. They confeſs too that he ſtole from Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius; but this, they add,
was a proof of his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem <pb n="x" facs="tcp:1185300301:15"/> for him. They then candidly
hint that it was little better than receiving ſtolen goods, for that
Lucretius himſelf is ſuſpected of having taken ſome of his works from
Empedocles and others, and yet, in the ſame breath, they ſay that Lucretius
ranks before all other Latin authors. They defend Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil from a charge that
Lucan was a greater poet, combating the opinions of Heinſius, Corneille,
Heron, and Fielding, who all give the palm to Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can; but, to make this defence
as left-handed as poſſible, they allow that the Pharſalia is more
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete than the Aeneid, becauſe there is a fault in the chronology; which
anacroniſm, however, to gloſs over, they inſiſt that Virgil intended it
as a beauty, and then follow up this cold compliment by ſaying that Lucan,
though an original, was an original of no value. The deduction therefore is,
that it is doubtful whether Virgil was not a worſe poet than Lucan, who,
after all, has no great merit himſelf. But a modern critic has gone a great
deal beyond this; aſſerting, that though the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Virgil
ſtands upon three ſpecimens of imitation, though he has no invention, no
origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:1185300301:16"/> no creation, yet he deſerves all his
fame:—and how does he make this out? Why, truly, by attributing this fame
to his ſtyle, which he calls the 
<q rend="inline">'pickle that has preſerved his mummy from
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>Were I to advert to the long catalogue of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite opinions
which will very eaſily occur to any man of reading, who has a faithful and
retentive memory, it would be an intruſion on the patience of every
intelligent reader. I have inſtanced abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly enough to prove that
cavillers find it difficult to convince; that Envy beholds pigmy
imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and neglects giant beauties; and that fools, in ſearch of
defects and contradictions, deprive themſelves of that pleaſure and
improvement with which heaven permits men of ſuperior talents to adorn the
world.</p>
            <p>It is with me a matter of infinite concern, that if candour be the
criterion of genius, the ancients poſſeſſed more genius than the
moderns. When Euripides died, Sophocles went into mourning; 
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:1185300301:17"/> and yet, to prove that Sophocles was fond of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,
he died with joy at the ſucceſs of one of his own tragedies. What can be
more noble than the declaration of Theodore Gaza, that if all the works then
extant were to be thrown into the ſea, the laſt that would merit ſuch a
fate would be the works of Plutarch! Or the forbearance of Zenophon, who might
have had the writings of Thucidides attributed to him, but he diſdained
it!</p>
            <p>If the cotemporaries of Terence acknowledge that he has imitated
Plautus, they never fail to add that it was making gold out of droſs. By one
it was ſaid, that the very proſtitutes of Terence ſpeak with more
modeſty than the honeſt women of Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. Cicero, ſpeaking of the purity
of Terence, calls him the regulator of the Latin tongue. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, when he
ſacked Thebes, ſpared the houſe and poſterity of Pindar. Plato was
called the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. Zenophon, from his ſweetneſs and beauty, is called the
bee, and the attic muſe. His works are ſaid to have inſpired Scipio, the
African, and <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:1185300301:18"/> Lucullus, in like manner as thoſe of
Homer fired the mind of Alexander.</p>
            <p>When do we hear, in theſe times, ſuch warmth and candour as
that of Appolonius Molus? who, on hearing Cicero harrangue, exclaimed— 
<q rend="inline">'Poor Greece! Now thou art utterly
undone!—The Romans had before conquered thee in arms: now they have
conquered thee in eloquence!'</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe few inſtances, among many that occur to me, prove that
the ancients poſſeſſed every merit that has been attributed to them,
and ſhew that the greateſt effort of the human mind is to riſe
ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to envy.</p>
            <p>The influence of this fiend, however, lay only dormant till the
ineſtimable works of theſe great men were univerſally diffuſed. The
moment that opportunity occurred, ſhe ſhook off her torpor, awoke, walked
abroad, and looked ſo terrible, that modeſt reaſon ſighed, bluſhed,
and retired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:1185300301:19"/> To be plain. It is remarkable that the more
modern we get, the more the number of cavillers increaſes; and, really, as
cavilling is a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious thing, this is lucky for them; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the taſk becomes every day more and more difficult, and becauſe the dunces
become every day more and more ſtupid. Thus the labour, by being given into
ſo many hands, is infinitely leſs tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous.</p>
            <p>The quantum of abuſe muſt be always the ſame, and how hard
it is to fall to the lot of one man, wholly to employ himſelf in ſearching
out the faults of his neighbour, when, by an honeſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation of his
time, he might manifeſt ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his own. This feat of
hardihood, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we ſee Milbourn, almoſt ſingle-handed, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
againſt Dryden, though the portion of abuſe is as great, and the quality as
malevolent, as all that vaſt cargo of Grub-ſtreet filth with which Pope was
beſpattered, by all the heroes immortalized in the Dunciad; and, if we want a
climax, we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but look at that flock of critical crows 
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:1185300301:20"/> who, even yet, have not left off gorging on the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary
carcaſe of Doctor Johnſon.</p>
            <p>But, if I were to go into that large field of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation which
it would be neceſſary to traverſe to get at the divers ſchiſms that
have, at times, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the ſtate of literature, I ſhould make it the
field of battle between the moderns and the ancients. In France I ſhould
ſet Corneille and Racine againſt Sophocles and Euripides; Malherbe
againſt Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar; Moliere againſt Menander and Ariſtophanes, nay Plautus
and Terence. The Counteſs De la Suſe and Madame Dacier would pull caps with
Sapho. In Italy, Petrarch and Guarini would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack Ovid and Tibullus;
Taſſo would menace to their teeth Homer and Virgil; Camoes, Lopez de Vega,
Calderone, and Cervantes, would ſingle out their reſpective antagoniſts,
for the honour of Spain and Portugal; and I ſhould involve literature in that
chaos of prejudices and opinions, from which men of the beſt learning find it
ſo extremely diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to ſeparate its conſtituent parts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:1185300301:21"/> Did I extend the ſcene to England,
inſtead of the preface to a work, I muſt neceſſarily make this a work
of itſelf. So many, ſo extraordinary, ſo vague, ſo diverſified have
been the real or affected opinions in this country, as to what conſtitutes
the eſſence of literary perfection, that you have only to tranſmute them,
as you ring changes upon bells, and every Engliſh writer, at different times,
has, and has not, poſſeſſed it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore, by way of corroborating my aſſertion,
that no man is entitled to any large por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of literary fame till he has been
handſomely abuſed, only inſtance ſome of that prodigious load of foul
and ſlanderous filth which—as good ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times grows out of
evil—procured the world thoſe two monuments of genius and juſtice,
Mac Flecnoe, and the Dunciad; and I the more readily do this, to ſhew that
one ſpecimen is as good as a thouſand: becauſe, were I to produce a
thouſand, nothing could be ſaid in them but what is already ſaid here;
nay, nor even in one of theſe that is not ſaid in the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:1185300301:22"/> Milbourn, as I before mentioned, is the
au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of nearly all the calumny againſt Dryden.—Pope's calumniators
are Dennis, Theobald, Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixon, and a variety of others, who, one ſhould
think, were more than adequate to the taſk; for they had nothing to do but
copy what had been written before. Dryden, upon this ſingle, and Pope, upon
this complicate authority, are every thing that can be ſaid of the worſt
men and the worſt writers.</p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"Dryden is a mere renegado from monarchy, poetry,

            </p>
            <p>The epithets which have been beſtowed on theſe great men are
ſtill more curious. Milbourn <pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:1185300301:26"/> thus calls Dryden an ape. 
<q rend="inline">"A crafty ape, dreſſed in a gaudy gown. Whips
put into an ape's paw, to play pranks with. None but apiſh and papiſh brats

            </p>
            <p>Dennis is juſt as kind to Pope. 
<q rend="inline">'Let us take,' ſays he, 'the initial letter of

            <p>Dryden, according to Milbourn, is alſo an aſs.

            </p>

            </p>
            <p>Dryden is, after this, a frog.

which would ſwell to the bulk of an ox."</q>
            </p>

<q rend="inline">'A ſquab, ſhort gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: a little creature,
that, like the frog in the fable, ſwells, and is angry that it is not allowed

            </p>
            <p>Dryden is, after this, and ſo is Pope, a knave, a coward, a
fool, and a thing; which indeed—if a pun may be pardoned—ſeems
the only thing left for them to ſay.</p>
            <p>If then ignorance, impoſition, cowardice kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, profligacy,
irreligion, and treaſon are requiſite attributes to eſtabliſh the

<q rend="inline">"why what a vile and peaſant ſlave am I!"</q>
My calumniators have gone but a very little way indeed towards aſcertaining
my merit by this criterion. I beg therefore they will beſtir themſelves;
and as, in this novel, I have given them new opportunity—eſpecially as
they may find in it a mirror that will <pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:1185300301:28"/> reflect ſome
of their own faces—I aſſure them they cannot afford me a more
ſenſible pleaſure than to avail themſelves of it, as uſual, unawed by
truth, candour, or conſiſtency.</p>
            <p>Having indubitably proved that it is my inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to be
abuſed, I ſhall now, for the advantage of thoſe who, though they intend
enmity, confer kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhew in what way it may beſt, or rather moſt
expediently, be done.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I would have them keep no ſort of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but
indulge their rancour as much as poſſible. Let their method be to hold
ſuch trifles as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, propriety, and decency in contempt; to uſe
perpetually epithets which are appropriate to rage, diſappointment, and
vexation, to enforce terms that imply candour, ingenuouſneſs and
liberality.—Thus, in proportion as they are burſting with envy, ſo,
at leaſt in their own opinions, they will conceal it: like the ſilly bird,
that thruſts its head into a hedge, to hide its body from its purſuers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:1185300301:29"/> If they would detect nonſenſe, I would
have them write nonſenſe themſelves; becauſe this will ſhew
practically what it is. Ignorance of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is a good thing;
becauſe it ſerves to exerciſe the ingenuity of the reader. Ill manners is
not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs; for it often bullies the reader into a fancied comprehenſion of
what in reality is incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
            <p>I would have all their outworks of criticiſm fortified with
threats, denunciations, and menaces. I would have theſe ſupported by
impudence, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and cruelty. I would have them place about faſcines of
hints, inſinuations, and conjectures; and when, by a powerful onſet of
truth and conviction, they were driven from theſe, I would have them take
ſhelter in their ſtrong hold of <hi>ipſe dixit;</hi> that anticipater of
argument, that reconciler of abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, that friend of ignorance, that
vehicle of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolence, that poiſoned arrow, that coiled ſnake, that
baneful flower, that ſmiling precipice!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ipſe dixit!—</hi>the ſkulking retreat of the
ſhuffler, <pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:1185300301:30"/> the hypocrite, the villain, the traitor, and
the raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal! <hi>Ipſe dixit!—</hi>that ſhall blaſt the faith of
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that ſhall fully the purity of virtue, that ſhall pervert truth,
ſanctify miſchief, emulate murder, annihilate order, reprobate morality,
dignify ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, profane the throne, and defy heaven!</p>
            <p>Let them utter <hi>ipſe dixits</hi> then like ſo many fiats,
but never let them preſume to argue; leſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by ignorance,
forſaken by truth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſcorn, they betray frontleſs
impudence and ſcowling envy, hidden by a filmy veil of candour.</p>
            <p>There are ſome ſubjects however with which I would not
adviſe them to tamper. In particular, let them not riſk the awkward
predicament in which they would ſtand if they were hardy enough to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the public for the warm and liberal reception afforded to my labours. Let them
not venture to ſlander thoſe men of worth and honour who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in me, in
oppoſition to them, a life of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, ſobriety, and induſtry: and,
above all, as it is impoſſible for human invention—not even their
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention—to <pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:1185300301:31"/> give any other motive to the
honourable and generous ſupport by which I have the happineſs to be
diſtinguiſhed by that nobleman who preſides over public amuſements,
than unexampled and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant benevolence; let them, inſtead of
attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſcribe it, ſcowl, bite their malignant quills, gnaſh
their teeth, and hang their recreant heads in ſullenneſs and deſpair.</p>
            <p>With theſe inſtructions, I think they can hardly miſs their
way. If there ſhould be any danger of it—as it would be a pity that
ſuch charitable inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould reap nothing but ſhame and
confuſion—by way of conſummating their noble and manly purpoſe, let
them boldly aſſert that I have written none of this book. Let them be ſo
ungratefully ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere as to ſay it is not I who have given them this
friendly advice, but ſome outcaſt from ſociety; and, as novelty in
ſlander is as catching as in any thing elſe—having gone every other
length—ſuppoſe this time, by way of variety, it were to be attributed
to ſome murderer. I think, as Mr. Bayes has it, the circumſtance would
elevate and ſurpriſe. But this, <pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:1185300301:32"/> after all, I leave
to themſelves; for it is impoſſible I ſhould be an adept in an employ
the motives of which I ſcorn, and the malignity of which I deteſt.</p>
            <p>If, by officiouſly pointing out their readieſt road, it
ſhould appear to them that I have, by anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, betrayed the cloven
foot, and they ſhould be therefore induced to forego their intentions, from
an apprehenſion of detection—for aſſaſſins are always
cowards—let it be remembered that I ſhall ſet it down for a ſulky
perverſeneſs; and, even though no ſingle word of abuſe ſhall be
breathed againſt me, I ſhall take very comfortably to myſelf the ſame
portion of fame as if ſuch advantageous circumſtance had really happened,
and ſet it down, with all the compoſure in the world, as a large figure to
go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that aggregate of ſlander which I have ſo plainly ſhewn is
neceſſary to conſtitute the fame of a writer, and which, upon that ground
of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I am ſo ambitious to merit.</p>
            <p>Having gone through the painful part of my duty—for there is
nothing ſo painful as that which <pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:1185300301:33"/> is unavailing, and
there is nothing ſo unavailing as giving advice to the incorrigible—a
few words will bring me to the end of this preface. A few very pleaſing
words! They are theſe: that in this, as in every other inſtance where I
have offered any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the public, having portrayed vice in its
uglieſt form and filthieſt colours; having hunted craft and art to the
toils; having invited the broad laugh againſt vain and inſuperable folly;
having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the admiration, and commended the practice, of virtue and
honour, I fearleſsly truſt my book to its fortune, ſafe in the
criticiſm of the candid, and ſecure in the indulgence of the liberal; for
the moral I inculcate is the folly of wickedneſs, and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of
rectitude: a doctrine which ſhews, that while irritated vice multiplies
deformity, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mirror of nature, it remains entire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullied
to the eye of virtue, that conſciouſly reflects its own unſpotted
lovelineſs.</p>

THE READER'S INDULGENCE.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>As it very often happens that readers get half through a work
without knowing its drift—not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequently becauſe the author does not
know it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—I hold it neceſſary to preclude all
poſſibility of any ſuch thing in the peruſal of this work, by
premiſing what, according to my conception, ought to be the tendency of
productions ſimilar to this, and what I here mean to inculcate in
particular.</p>
               <p>A novel, as the word is now underſtood and eſtabliſhed, is
a general title for any work which <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1185300301:35"/> ſprings ſolely from
the imagination, yet ſo deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates men and manners as to place all its
events within view of probability. It is a kind of mean betwixt hiſtory,
which records mere fact, and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, which holds out acknowledged
fiction.</p>
               <p>As, however, pleaſure and inſtruction are the only end that
any admitted exerciſe of the imagination can propoſe, theſe all labour,
with different materials, to produce the ſame effect. Hiſtory not only
teaches mankind to ſhun vice and imitate virtue, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancing thoſe
events which are moſt conduſive to ſo laudable an end, but ſhews the
propriety of the doctrine it enforces, by authenticating the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of ſuch conduct.</p>
               <p>The noveliſt, who is the biographer of an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary hero,
chuſes, for his ſource, manners in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. His margin cannot ſwell with
authorities, nor can he—by way of notes—cite the contrary opinions
of great men concerning the vices or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of thoſe characters he
celebrates. So they poſſeſs the ſame qualities in common with the
reſt of mankind, and the events brought about by their means are ſuch as
our obſervation points out to be natural, his taſk is completely performed;
and he has a right to expect as much credit for relating circumſtances that
might have happened, as he <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1185300301:36"/> who—as far as he can clear
his narrative from the cobwebs of tradition, and diſentangle it from the
labyrinth of contradictory authority—records facts that did happen.</p>
               <p>Romances are, figuratively, in nature; and, lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
fictitious. They are intended, by lifting the mind above probability, to
enforce moral by figure and allegory: and they attain their end—and
indeed laudably—for they rouſe thoſe torpid minds into action which
cannot reliſh writings that are kept within the bounds of ſimple
nature.</p>
               <p>This ſpecies of compoſition is remarkably grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to
weak minds. It is—if I may be permitted ſo to expreſs
myſelf—an honourable fraud; for, exaggerate the beauty of virtue how
you can, it will ſtill be lovely; whereas vice, being ugly in itſelf,
becomes more hideous when it is carica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured.</p>
               <p>Theſe three different vehicles for the conveyance of truth and
morality, ſeem to require different conductors; and indeed it has ſeldom
happened that any one man has equally ſucceeded in them.—Romance
ſeems to require a poetic ſoul: ſtrong in conception, fertile in
invention, and various in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Hiſtory wants nothing but a
perſpicuous <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1185300301:37"/> ſtyle, authentic information, and
invincible vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
               <p>He who writes novels muſt partake of all theſe qualities. He
muſt unite in his imagination the glow of poetry with the ſteadineſs of
narrative.—The latter muſt be as a curb to the former: not, however, to
damp its ſpirit, but to prevent it from running away:—like the
alderman, who, at a lord mayor's feaſt, would have made himſelf ſick if
his phyſician had not ſat by the ſide of him.</p>
               <p>Thus I think it becomes pretty evident that novel writing holds
a very reſpectable ſtand in literature, and I ſincerely believe that men
of conſiderable ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents would very often practiſe it, were it not for
thoſe ſpurious productions with which the preſs teems under the
appellation of novels, which means any love ſtory calculated to madden the
minds of ſentimental country ladies, to trouble the domeſtic happineſs of
old gentlemen who marry young girls, and to overturn the purity imbibed at
boarding ſchools.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſure to make their way into all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating
libraries in the kingdom, provided they are ſufficiently ſtuffed with dying
lovers, inexorable parents, and impertinent chambermaids; with the 
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1185300301:38"/> addition of three or four elopements, half a dozen duels,
and an attempt or two at a rape; to which may be added, a little ſuicide, or
a ſmattering of inceſt—eſpecially if it be written by a
lady—by way of zeſt, to make it go down the more glib.</p>
               <p>Being about to give a novel to the world, I thought it incumbent
on me to ſay thus much; from which the reader will naturally conclude that I
intend, throughout this work, to keep nature and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in ſight, to
reject that which is frivolous and impertinent, and to adopt only what, by
means of amuſement, may bring about inſtruction.</p>
               <p>It will nevertheleſs be neceſſary to ſay further, that,
in portraying nature, I ſhall make her neither a flattering likeneſs, nor a
caricature. Nor is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; for, let her ſit for her picture ever
ſo often, ſhe never will exhibit the ſame face twice, yet ſhall the
general reſemblance always be ſtriking; for it has been well obſerved,
that ſhe takes every various hue of the camelion, yet, torture her how you
will, her form is as conſtant as the polypus. No two hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man faces, though
compoſed of the ſame features, ever were known to be correctly alike, and
the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous mind of LAVATER, did he attempt the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous and abſurd taſk
of ſearching for any ſuch would exactly reſemble the lanthorn of
AESOP.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1185300301:39"/> To theſe general remarks—which I
conceived it expedient to place here—I ſhall add particular ones
whenever they appear to be neceſſary, and now I invite the reader to the
examination of a faithful, though a bold, repreſentation of human life, for I
declare upon my word as a man, there is not a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter or circumſtance in
this whole work which I do not experimentally know from a cloſe
obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and mankind, to have virtual exiſtence.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>CONTAINS A DESCRIPTION—TWO HOUSES—A
CITIZEN—AND A REFLECTION UPON DEATH.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A BRIDGE thrown over the high road, at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of a
village in Warwickſhire, called Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, is the ſeparation of two
eſtates, one of which had been, at the period this hiſtory commences, for
half a century in the poſſeſſion of the family of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and the
other, for almoſt treble that ſpace, in the family of Roebuck.</p>
               <p>Nature had been equally bountiful in the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her
favours on either ſide of the road, which fortuitous advantage art had been
induſtriouſly called in to improve. If a neat hamlet and a white ſpire
gave a more modern termination to the view, through a group of pines and
cedars, from Hazard lawn; an old market town and a contiguous moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
caſtle became viſible, through an avenue of elms, from Roebuck park.</p>
               <p>Every Chineſe temple, urn, or ſtatue, on one ſide, erected
to fancy, conſecrated to friendſhip, or dedicated to the arts, had, on the
other, its rival <pb n="8" facs="tcp:1185300301:41"/> grotto, cavern, or hermitage. Here was
ſeen a clump of elms, there a row of oaks; while the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andering
avon—leſt the lord of one manſion ſhould be jealous of its favours
laviſhed on the other—not only by the advantage of a diſtant height,
plunged up a rocky cliff to delight one favourite with the awful concuſſion
of a beautiful caſcade, which fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, leſſened into a gurgling rivulet;
but, alſo, opening its ſmooth, capacious boſom, moved on in majeſtic
ſilence, through the poſſeſſions of the other; ſtretching out on
one ſide a ſmall, irregular ſtream, which ſupplied the houſe, watered
the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and turned the village mill.</p>
               <p>Old Ruſt, the grandfather of Lord Hazard, was a ſkinner in
the city. His profeſſion unluckily made him rather a bye-word; for he had
ſuch a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racious thirſt, or hunger, after money—for gold can be both
eaten and drank—that it was archly ſaid he would ſkin any thing for
profit. Nay, ſome are of opinion that, from this very remark, originated the
epithet ſkinflint. Be that as it may, he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly amaſſed a very large
fortune, and having run through the regular progreſſion of livery-man,
common council-man, deputy, alderman, ſheriff, and lord mayor, he married in
his ſeventy-firſt year, a girl of ſixteen, without a ſixpence, who bore
him—or ſomebody elſe—a ſon, portioned three of 
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1185300301:42"/> her ſiſters, granted a penſion to an Iriſh
relation, ſet up a coach, and bought a villa; till at length, having
expoſtulated, ſtormed, threatened, prayed, and entreated, to no purpoſe,
poor Ruſt—think of it with horror ye antiquated Adonises—died
raving mad in St. Luke's hoſpital.</p>
               <p>Previous to his inſanity, however, he took care to make a
will, veſting his whole poſſeſſions in the hands of truſtees, for
the uſe of his ſon. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains were, therefore, ſcarcely laid in the
earth, when the widow, with a moderate annuity, was obliged to ſink into
retirement; and of her it will not be neceſſary to ſay more than that
ſhe died when her ſon, who was purpoſely kept from her by his guardians,
came to be eighteen years old.</p>
               <p>Young Ruſt, beſides the poſſeſſion of uncommon
talents, was wonderfully calculated for commerce. Before he was thirty he
conſiderably augmented his deceaſed father's wealth; and, a few years
after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards—having bought a large eſtate which gave him the entire
nomination of four members of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament—he became ſo material an
object to the miniſter, that he was made one of thoſe peers which it was
then expedient to create, leſt the balance of power in the conſtitution
ſhould be found to lean too much to the ſide of the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1185300301:43"/> No longer Mr. Ruſt, then, but Baron
Hazard, he pulled down the old manſion on the eſtate he had purchaſed,
and built that very chateau we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready commemorated. As he had a towering
am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, he now married into an honourable family, not overburdened with
riches; was ſhortly bleſt with ſeveral children; and had made ſome
rapid ſtrides towards an improvement in both church and ſtate;
but—ſo tranſitory is the felicity of lords, as well as inferior
beings—he did not live long to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that ſucceſs his hopes ſeemed
to promiſe:—for, ſitting up a whole night to compoſe a ſpeech,
which was to have introduced a plan to deſtroy pluralities, and root out
corruption, he caught a cold, which being followed by a fever, he was hurried
out of the world, having ſcarcely time to ſettle his affairs.</p>
               <p>The young lord—but here, kind reader, let us both give a
ſigh to the memory of Lord Hazard, and admire that the wiſeſt deſigns

               <argument>
                  <p>CONTAINING ONE APPEAL TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS—AND ANOTHER
TO THE READER.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE young lord—for we ſhall have no occaſion for the
reſt of the family—ſaw himſelf his own maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at a very early
period of life; a circumſtance which, together with diſſipated company at
the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and a profligate tutor, contributed to form in him the
ſtrongeſt principles of debauchery and libertiniſm.</p>
               <p>When he became of age, his licentiouſneſs made him the
terror of the neighbourhood. It is true he was a little checked in his wild
career by the wiſe and wholeſome counſels of his mother, to which he at
firſt affected to liſten; but, becoming more and more hardened, her
precepts and conduct were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together diſregarded; till at length, worn out
with preaching to no purpoſe, ſhe retired into the boſom of her own
family, with a firm determination to conſider herſelf entirely alienated
from her diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:1185300301:45"/> Lord Hazard being now left to the unbridled
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his headſtrong paſſions, ſtopt at nothing to gratify
them. The farmers' wives and daughters, if they had the ſmalleſt
pretenſions to beauty, were ſure to become objects firſt of his
generoſity, then his gratification, and afterwards his neglect: or, if they
durſt diſpute his impetuous wiſhes, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable reſentment. But,
as the ſwifteſt cannon ball, which neither edifices of wood nor ſtone can
oppoſe, may be ſtopt in its very ſtrongeſt velocity by the dull
reſiſtance of a wool pack, ſo were the vehement purſuits of Lord Hazard
effectually checked by that dulleſt of all dull things, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the
bachelors—ay, and many of the married men too—a wife.</p>
               <p>My lord's tutor, whoſe name was Viney, and who, as I hinted
before, had the higheſt aſcendancy over his pupil—having ever been
cnofiderably more uſeful to him in the conduct of his love affairs than in
his ſtudy of the claſſics—had alſo another pupil. Indeed his
attention to this laſt mentioned ſcholar, on whom he had expended a large
part of that money which the bounty to Lord Hazard—for his lordſhip was
liberal to exceſs—had laviſhed on him, would appear very enigmatical
did we not derive it from its natural motive.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:1185300301:46"/> This ſcholar then was no other than his
ſiſter, who, without a penny, had married an Iriſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hunter, and
was very ſhortly ſaved the trouble of breaking his heart by a kind friend
of his, who killed him in a duel. Viney had connived at this marriage, which,
ſoon after it was conſummated, was found to be a mutual bite. However, as
his ſiſter was left a blooming widow of twenty-two, he eaſily comforted
himſelf by conſidering her market as not yet over. In a word, he had long
in idea married her to Lord Hazard. This will account for his generoſity:
nor, when it is conſidered how completely this ſame Mr. Viney ruled his
pupil, will it appear very unaccountable that the lady ſhould become at
length in reality what ſhe had long been in imagination.</p>
               <p>Marriage ſtopt for a while the exceſſes of Lord Hazard. He
doated on his wife; and, having taken this ſtep, Viney became his privy
counſellor in a ſtronger degree than ever. His tone, however, was ſoon
changed. He found her a mixture of arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, meanneſs, bridled
wantonneſs, and ignorant affectation. Nor is it difficult to divine where it
might have ended if he had not accidentally diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, after having been
about three months bleſſed with an heir, that ſhe had an intrigue with
his valet de chamber.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1185300301:47"/>
               <p>This rouſed him at once. She was properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, the
neceſſary ſteps were taken, and a divorce obtained. She recriminated,
indeed, but he was a lord, and his ſucceſs certain. Thus, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſatisfaction for the injuries he had ſuſtained, he legally baniſhed her
for ever from his preſence, granting her only a decent proviſion for
life.</p>
               <p>Any one experienced in the human heart will eaſily ſee the
part Viney took upon his ſiſter's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. He exclaimed againſt her
with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt violence, and was the forwardeſt in procuring his
lordſhip that redreſs which he knew it was not in his power to prevent.</p>
               <p>This conduct eſtabliſhed him more firmly than ever in the
good graces and houſehold of Lord Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; the firſt of which advantages he
often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared—loudly to the world—was the ultimate end of all his
wiſhes; becauſe, ſaid he—ſoftly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—it brings
about the other.</p>
               <p>I have already ſhewn that marriage proved a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty tight curb
to the exceſſes of this young noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and one would think his divorce
had given him a reaſonable ſurfeit of marriage; but, I know not how it is,
ſome men ſeem to be the bubble of their own arts: their whole ſtudy is to
overreach <pb n="15" facs="tcp:1185300301:48"/> themſelves, and if they ſtumble on tolerable
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, it is becauſe things take a different turn from what they
deſigned.</p>
               <p>Thus it happened with our peer. Every reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he took, in
conſequence of being a widower, was wrong; and yet he hit upon happineſs
when he only meant revenge.</p>
               <p>This was his argument. He had married a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of ſpirit, who
had injured him in the ſtrongeſt degree, and, for this indignity, he was
determined to take vengeance on her whole ſex; idly forgetting that this was
revenging himſelf on a whole hive, for the ſting of a ſingle bee.
Beſides, he himſelf was to blame: the fault lay in his own want of
diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Had he fairly examined the ground of the buſineſs, he would
have plainly ſeen that it origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with Viney, who had taught him nothing
but what diſgraced his birth, and deprived him of the uſe of that valuable
goodneſs of heart which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally poſſeſſed, and which, had he
fallen into proper hands, might have induced him to have diſpenſed the
gifts of fortune nobly inſtead of licentiouſly.</p>
               <p>To put this worthy project in execution, Lord Hazard reſolved
once more to try the married ſtate, reſolutely vowing to conduct himſelf
in ſo authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative <pb n="16" facs="tcp:1185300301:49"/> a manner to his ſecond wife, that
ſhe ſhould not dare even to think without his previous permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. He
had ſcarcely come to this reſolution, but his uneaſineſs on his late
diſgrace vaniſhed. He looked round for a wife with the greateſt
eagerneſs, till at length, with Viney's aſſiſtance, who was ſtill
conſulted, he thought he had found one to his wiſh.</p>
               <p>But how was he aſtoniſhed when he plainly ſaw it would be
impoſſible to avail himſelf of any one of thoſe prudent determinations,
thoſe ingenious precautions he had been ſo long and ſo induſtriouſly
arming himſelf with. He had now ſuch a wife that to controul her was
impoſſible; to adviſe her, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs!</p>
               <p>If my readers think he was again caught, after ſo much wary
and cautious reſolution, after ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of ſucceſs, I hope it
will be confeſſed he deſerved it.</p>
               <p>Certainly he was diſappointed, but in that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory way
that a man would be at finding a lawyer who, taking a brief, ſhould refuſe
a fee. Lady Hazard could not be controuled, adviſed, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated; for ſhe
had ſo high a ſenſe of her duty, ſuch equanimity of temper, and ſuch
ſweetneſs of <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1185300301:50"/> manners, that ſhe anticipated her
lord's very wiſhes. He had received her from her father, a wealthy country
neighbour, who wanted to aggrandize his family. The young lady, who had all her
life made it her ſtudy to pleaſe her father, found it no irkſome taſk
to watch and comply with the tempers of her huſband:—ſo true it is
that a dutiful daughter has gone a great way towards becoming a good wife.</p>
               <p>If ever an extraordinary event new moulded a man's mind, this
unexpected merit in his wife had that effect on Lord Hazard. He ſaw in an
inſtant that his whole life had been one deluſion; that while he had
ſought for pleaſure, he had neglected happineſs; and, therefore,
reſolved doubly to cheriſh it, ſince it had complacently condeſcended
to come home to him.</p>
               <p>Nobody had ever dared to tell him he was a dupe to Viney: he now
ſaw it himſelf. He did not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, think proper to withdraw his
protection from him, but contented himſelf only with giving him a handſome
rectory, to which that worthy incumbent ſhortly removed.</p>
               <p>In about a twelvemonth after this ſecond mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage—but
hold, all great events ſhould be uſhered in with cautious preparation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:1185300301:51"/> A watchmaker would have called the
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I am about to celebrate the main ſpring of this hiſtory; a
ſailor would have ſaid it was its helm; and an alderman its marrow.</p>
               <p>It is ſomething, therefore, of material conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and,
of courſe, proper to be given in a new chapter, and with a particular
introduction:—all which ceremony, though it may be the limbs and outward

               </argument>
               <p>IT falls out ſometimes at the theatre, that, at the very

an actor, with a woe-begone countenance, comes on the ſtage to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the
indiſpoſition of the principal actreſs.</p>
               <p>This once happened of Deſdemona; and, as there was no lady in
the company competent to the part but her whoſe name was in the bills, a
gentleman undertook it at a very ſhort warning. The ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators were, as
uſual, content per force; but, after waiting a conſiderable time, the
apologizer was a ſecond time obliged to come on, who aſſured the audience
the play would ſoon begin, but at preſent Deſdemona was not ſhaved.</p>
               <p>I hope it will not be thought, by mentioning this caſe in
point, that I mean to introduce in a ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous way, a matter of ſuch eminent
importance as that I now take the liberty of preſenting to the 
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1185300301:53"/> reader's notice; but, my <hi>amour propre</hi> is wounded:
for being forced—at the very critical moment I conſidered myſelf

fairly laying the truth before them, and humbly appealing to their candour:
or—according to the language of the ſtanding theatrical
apology—their uſual indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
               <p>I was going to begin this chapter in a moſt lovely ſtyle, by
ſaying that the bees came about ſomebody's cradle, and left their honey on
his lips; giving proof that he would be ſweet and eloquent in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
But, caſting in my mind who this ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body could be, it preſently
ſtruck me—for I 
<q rend="inline">"do bear a brain"</q>—that the point was
not ſettled.</p>
               <p>This prodigy is related of ST. AMBROSE of Milan. Doctor JOHNSON,
who ought to have known ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about the matter, ſays it was PINDAR;
but FENELON affirms it was ſaid of PLATO by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor SENECA, who, while
the circumſtance was warm in his mind, dreamt that a cygnet flew to his
boſom, which, by degrees, became covered with feathers of a moſt beautiful
and dazzling whiteneſs; <pb n="21" facs="tcp:1185300301:54"/> and which, taking wing, flew
with a force and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity ſuperior to an eagle:—and theſe prodigies
were ſo ſtrongly verified in this great man, that CICERO ſaid of him,
when he grew up, 
<q rend="inline">"If JUPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER had condeſcended to ſpeak like
man, he would have uſed the language of PLATO."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now it cannot be denied but that here is proof upon proof on the
ſide of FENELON; and, as he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered this intelligence for the improvement
of princes, one would think that he muſt have made a point of collecting his
materials from the beſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities. But as there is no court of criticiſm
to appeal to from the fiat of Dr. JOHNSON—his <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> being
always final upon theſe occaſions—if the reader pleaſe it ſhall
ſtand for PINDAR: not for the living PINDAR, becauſe every body knows that,
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of honey, he deals in nothing but gall.</p>
               <p>In this caſe it is melancholy to loſe the beautiful dream of
SENECA, and the fine ſaying of CICERO, but ornament and flouriſh muſt
give way to truth and Dr. JOHNSON. Beſides, Mr. BOSWELL informs us that the

Telemachus to be written more than 
<q rend="inline">"pretty well."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having eſtabliſhed this important point, I ſhall 
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1185300301:55"/> regularly proceed to the buſineſs of introducing my
hero, who having ſet the poets together by the ears before he was born, will
be allowed to have given a pretty good ſpecimen of the work he was to cut out
for them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Many and various are the portents and omens that are ſaid to
have announced the births, deaths, and marriages of great men and women; and I
could muſter up a long catalogue of them, from the lady who made ſo
handſome a deluge as to ſwallow up all Aſia, to Tom Thumb—which is
a pretty touch of the bathos—who was ſwallowed up by a cow; but that it
would inſenſibly draw me into an imitation of certain authors, who are
fonder of ſhewing their reading than their good manners.</p>
               <p>I ſhall be forgiven however, ſince a great man and a prodigy
are almoſt ſynonimous terms, if I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that nature did not go a ſingle
ſtep out of her road to introduce our hero: neither his father nor his mother
having dreamt any thing prodigious on the occaſion.</p>
               <p>Viney indeed had a confuſed idea in a dream of a baſiliſk
which kept continually in his way, and the nurſe, as ſhe nodded by the fire
ſide while Lady Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard was in labour, dreamt that her young maſter— 
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1185300301:56"/> for ſhe always ſaid it would be a boy—ſpoke
the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he came into the world, and that he believed any thing you ſaid
to him; which ſhe ſagaciouſly interpreted as a ſure ſign that he
would be very learned, and very much impoſed upon:—the truth of which
obſervation the reader may perhaps have occaſion to admire before he and I
part.</p>
               <p>Lady Hazard's being brought to bed of a ſon, to the great joy
of that honourable family, ſeems then to be the event I hinted at in the
third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It really took place about a twelve month after the marriage,
and three years and a quarter—for I love to be exact—after the
birth of the firſt ſon, whom Lord Hazard called Zekiel, after his
grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, and this, our hero, Charles, after himſelf.</p>
               <p>The happineſs of Lord Hazard would now have been complete, had
it not been imbittered by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that the whole eſtate being
willed away with the title, he could not do his youngeſt ſon the juſtice
he wiſhed. To amend, however, this defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, he reſolved to make him a
paragon of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and, as he knew very well that had not the former part of
his own life been devoted to idleneſs, it would have been leſs given to
diſſipation, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to add a complete ſtudy of the arts to his
ſon's education.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:1185300301:57"/> In the contemplation of this plan he took
great delight. At length, when Zekiel had attained his eleventh year, he was
ſent to Eaton ſchool, to leave the coaſt clear for a proper attention to
the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Charles, which his lordſhip was determined to ſuperintend
himſelf.</p>
               <p>Many eſſays were made upon his tender intellects, which gave
very promiſing hopes; and now the difficulty was to get him a tutor. Lord
Hazard fairly owned he deſpaired of finding one to his wiſh. He declared he
had himſelf witneſſed ſo much ill conduct in men of that deſcription,
that he ſhould be very cautious indeed how he made a choice.</p>
               <p>Theſe doubts he often imparted to Lady Hazard, who ſaid
ſhe had mixed very little in the world, and therefore was happy whenever he
was ſo good as to give her his opinion, in order that ſhe might form hers.
She could not help thinking, however, that he was warmer on that ſubject than
he otherwiſe would have been, had not an ill choice been made in a tutor for
him. She hoped he would be able to find a man who ſhould have talents, and
yet be honeſt.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'If,' ſaid my lord, 'I could form a tutor, he
ſhould be ingenuous above all things; not aſhamed <pb n="25" facs="tcp:1185300301:58"/> if
he found any of thoſe trivial vices creeping on him to which human nature is
ſubject, to confeſs and amend them. Such a kind of man cannot deſign to
do ill, becauſe he is ſorry for his own infirmity. Ingenuouſneſs has a
tendency to gratitude, which is with me the firſt of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. I declare if I
was obliged to accuſe a man of a crime, and he could prove his motive to be
in the ſmalleſt degree ſimilar to any thing I had ever forgiven in
myſelf, I ſhould inſtantly feel an inclination to pardon him. It is the
ſneaking, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand villain I hate; the hypocrite, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, who
ſtudies to be a raſcal; who ſtings while he fawns. But he who acts from
mere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive principles, may correct his frailty by his judgment; and, at
any rate, you have a declared enemy, and know how to be on your guard. One
ſtands ſome chance with a lion, but who can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt the venom of
a ſlow worm?'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus ended a converſation which the reader may hereafter think
I had a reaſon for inſerting.</p>
               <p>Very little paſſed in this family worthy relation till
Maſter Charles was twelve years old, when one day my lord brought a gentleman
who, he ſaid, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, in every particular, that deſcription of
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he had ſo long and ſo fruitleſsly ſought for, as 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1185300301:59"/> a tutor for his darling ſon. As to Zekiel, he did not
believe him to be his ſon at all, though he had in vain tried to prove him
legally illegitimate. He therefore took very little further notice of him than
to remit him money; nor did he expreſs either aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhment or
diſſatisfaction at being told he was both an arrant dunce and an arrant
puppy. On the contrary, he ſarcaſtically obſerved 
<q rend="inline">"he would do well enough for a lord."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having brought matters in the family of Lord Hazard to a ſort
of ſtand ſtill, the reader and I will now, if he pleaſe, take a walk
acroſs the bridge into Roebuck park. But, upon recollection, being come now
to the center which commands a view of the whole village of Caſtlewick, and
its inhabitants making a part of our dramatis perſonae, we will take a
ſhort view of that little community, which had really ſomething to
recommend it to our notice.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>IN WHICH A VILLAGE IS DESCRIBED, NOT UNLIKE AN ANT-HILL.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE village of Caſtlewick contained about five hundred
inhabitants. About half the men and boys were generally employed at the trade
of wool-comb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; part of the women and girls in carding, ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
twiſting, and knitting; the more intelligent and experienced of the men in
journeying to large towns to purchaſe ſheep, and ſupply factors,
clothiers, and hoſiers with wool, yarn, worſted, ſtockings, nightcaps,
ſocks, and ſuch other articles as they manufactured. The lower order of the
men and boys were employed in tilling, manuring, and encloſing; and the
remainder of the women buſied themſelves in houſehold affairs, buying and
ſelling the neceſſaries of life, and ſuch other occupations as the
vicar—for this pariſh had no curate—pointed out to them.</p>
               <p>The vicar had two deputies, the clerk and the ſchoolmaſter;
and theſe three were all the perſons in the village who did no bodily
labour:—for Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewick <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1185300301:61"/> could boaſt neither
lawyer, exciſeman, nor apothecary.</p>
               <p>Their good paſtor undertook to regulate the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, as well
as ſpiritual, concerns of his flock; and, by a ſcrupulous diſcharge of
his duty as their treaſurer, ſhewed them more than by a thouſand precepts
how much it was their intereſt to act with truth and integrity towards each
other. Not that his preaching was not of a piece with his example, for every
Sunday they heard ſome new leſſon of ſweet and comfortable morality
from his mouth; for he, inſtead of deſcribing religion as a denunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of vengeance, and the deity as delighting in puniſhment, ſoftened that high
duty into a gentle and intelligent ſyſtem of morality, by inculcating the
principles of ſocial virtue and brotherly love, and repreſenting the
creator as an indulgent father watching with anxious and tender care over the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and happineſs of his children, and regarding their virtuous
endeavours with a ſmile of celeſtial benevolence:—thus troubling his
hearers with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond the reach of that capacity which had fallen to
their ſhare, and leaving the diſcuſſion of dogmas to larger
communities, who better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood cavilling.</p>
               <p>The clerk and the ſchoolmaſter kept an account 
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1185300301:62"/> of the receipts and diſburſements throughout the
pariſh. Theſe were faithfully audited by the vicar. Ten of the moſt
conſiderable of the inhabitants, who acted as a committee for the reſt,
were called in every week to the veſtry, where the books were always forth
coming for general inſpection.</p>
               <p>Every other regulation for the pleaſure and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this
happy community was proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably wiſe and ſalutary. Thus cheerfulneſs
ſmiled on their labours; content converted their pittance into plenty;
health, eaſe, and good humour accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied their ſteps, and they paſſed
their time in the exerciſe of as much moral rectitude as would have
immortalized them—had they been born an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Spartans—without
dreaming they did more than a common duty, for the ſake of general
conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience.</p>
               <p>By this time I believe the reader begins to ſuſpect that the
vicar, however well diſpoſed to lend a help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand towards the regulation
of this little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, as well as the clerk and the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter,
who kept the account of their finances, were but ſubordinate actors in this
performance, and here introduced, like the centinels in Hamlet and the
ſervants in the Orphan—both of which circumſtances VOLTAIRE is very
angry at—only to uſher in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital <pb n="30" facs="tcp:1185300301:63"/>
perſonage, who, having once made his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, is to receive all the
applauſe.</p>
               <p>It muſt be owned that the motions of Caſtlewick appeared to
be as regular as thoſe of its church clock, which clock, though any
blackſmith could wind it up, and ſet it a going, muſt have required a
much better mechanic to have invented it origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. If there ſhould be a
hidden firſt cauſe for this, it will be announced in its proper place. In
the mean time I cannot prevail upon myſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent my having introduced
theſe ſons of induſtry, inſignificant as they are. The mind is often
both improved and amuſed by the moſt trifling objects: the ſmaller the
mite the more worthy the curioſity of the philoſopher.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>WHICH PROVES THAT SOME OF THE OLD FASHIONS ARE NOT TO BE
DESPISED.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MY reader and I having paſſed through the rookery that
received us as we left the bridge, are now within ſight of the manſion of
Sir Sydney Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Roebuck, lord of the manor of Caſtlewick, and member of
parliament for the borough of Neither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</p>
               <p>The grandfather of this gentleman—for were I to trouble
the reader with any thing anterior, my deſcription would reſemble a game of
cheſs, where biſhops, knights, caſtles, and the king and queen are
continually croſſing each other. Indeed I have two other reaſons for not
going farther back; one is, that in the courſe of this hiſtory Sir Sidney
will talk to us a little about the fame of his anceſtors him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and the
other, that, for ought I could ever learn, their lives were, take them all in
all, ſuch a uniform mixture of morality, loyalty, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love, that
the deſcription of one would ſerve for the whole. Their tempers might not
be unaptly <pb n="32" facs="tcp:1185300301:65"/> compared to a bowl of punch, for though made up
of the ſame contrariety of ingredients in common with the reſt of their
fellow creatures, the mixture was ſo happily blended, that they diffuſed
comfort and cheerfulneſs to all around them.</p>
               <p>The grandfather then having taken umbrage at court for being
turned out of the cabinet, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he maintained that the Lancaſhire
witches were harmleſs old women—for which indeed Dr. JOHNSON would have
been as angry with him as the council were, for he tells us he will not ſay
there never was any ſuch thing as witchcraft, for that probably there might
have been, but that it had ceaſed—retired to the manſion of his
forefathers, which gothic and ſtately ſtructure the reader and I are
looking at.</p>
               <p>There having ſat contentedly down, with a quiet conſcience,
an active mind, and a princely fortune, he conſidered—which was nothing
more than his daily cuſtom—how he might beſt be ſerviceable to his
fellow creatures.</p>
               <p>He had not deliberated long on the ſubject before he
determined to build the village of Caſtlewick, and, like another Biſhop
Blaze, ſet up the trade of wool-combing. Nor was this, would he argue, a 
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1185300301:66"/> project unworthy his rank; wool was the ſtaple commodity
of that country he ſo dearly loved, and for which his anceſtors had ſo
gallantly ſhed their blood; the wool ſack was the emblem of honour, for it
ſuſtained the leading member of the houſe, and took place in that
aſſembly of every thing but the throne. He had yet a better reaſon: his
ſcheme would give employment to his tenants and other poor neighbours, and he
ſhould be ſure to receive the daily bleſſings of many families who
would owe a ſubſiſtance to their honeſt labours, under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpices
of his bounty.</p>
               <p>This gentleman lived to ſee his benevolent plan carried into
execution, and he enjoined his ſon to purſue it. This injunction was
faithfully complied with, but the preſent Sir Sidney conſiderably
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the number of houſes and inhabitants, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the former rules
and orders into a more regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and digeſted ſet of laws, and called in the
vicar and his adherents, as the reader has already ſeen, to aſſiſt him
in their execution.</p>
               <p>Thus, burning the Lancaſhire witches was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of one
public benefit at leaſt; for, had not the humanity of good old Sir Sidney
taken fire at the cruel propoſition, in all probability the village of
Caſtlewick would never have been built.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1185300301:67"/> The ſurviving gentleman of this family I
now take the liberty of introducing in form to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. He had many
ſingularities: one I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hinted at: another was a fixed averſion
to cards and dice; yet he was a ſtrenuous encourager of all athletic
ſports. He would ſometimes pitch the bar himſelf, and was allowed to be
the beſt bowler at cricket within ten miles. He was an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of the arts,
and never failed to bring with him from town, at the end of every
ſeſſions, a poet, a painter, and a muſician, who were obliged—and
ſo indeed were all others who wiſhed for his eſteem—to accompany
him in the different departments of his duty, as he called the regulation of
his little commonwealth. Nay ſometimes he would ſet them to work, on which
occaſion he enjoyed their awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs.</p>
               <p>Seeing once the wig of a counſellor catch in the girt of a
twiſting mill, as he was unhandily turning it round, it afforded no ſmall
diverſion to the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet, who facetiouſly exclaimed, 
<q rend="inline">"My good old friend, you let your learning fly
about at a ſtrange rate."</q>
               </p>
               <p>No man was more admired, nor ſought leſs to be ſo, than
Sir Sidney. Even the boobies, with whom he could not mix, becauſe he never
ſwore, gamed, <pb n="35" facs="tcp:1185300301:68"/> nor drank pint bumpers, declared he was a
gruffiſh odd ſort of a hearty cock. In ſhort, his heart was benevolent,
his means were ample, he was in the prime of life, ſurrounded with hundreds
of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere friends—which is a bold thing to ſay-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected,
valued, eſteemed, adored, almoſt deified, and yet he was not happy. I could
tell the reader why, but ſhall only ſo far indulge him as to ſay that,
according to Sir Sidney's own account, his unhappineſs was occaſioned by a
phantom he had ſeen, which had ſo poſſeſſed him, that he could not
reſt in his bed till he had opened his mind to it:—for, were I to
unriddle the whole ſecret of this ghoſt, the ſpirit and the reader's
curioſity would vaniſh together.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore collect together all the leading
circumſtances, that I may the more adroitly intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the time when, the
place where, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how, it appeared. And this has been a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
to authors and old women time immemorial; a climax having ever been allowed the
proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to introduce a cataſtrophe, and the candle's burning blue a
ſignal for the approach of a hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goblin.</p>
               <p>As ſoon, therefore, as I ſhall have terrified my readers
into a belief of the proper prognoſtic, the <pb n="36" facs="tcp:1185300301:69"/> ghoſt
ſhall ſtalk forth. To ſuffer this ſooner would be inartificial, and
conſequently an impeachment of my capacity of tantalizing the reader, which
would be an indelible diſgrace to the fraternity of novel writers, ſome of
whom have excited no other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
               <p>I hope, however, I ſhall be forgiven if I differ in the main
from this mode of conſtructing my work, and not deemed an innovator if I
endeavour to make ſatisfaction keep pace with expectation.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I MEAN to lead the reader on, chapter after chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, through
this hiſtory, in the ſame manner as we are led, day after day, through
life. They who experience the largeſt portions of human happineſs, are
ſure to have ſome unpleaſant moments in every four-and-twenty hours;
whereas the ſame degree of miſery will not ſo far overcome the fortitude
of others: but they find now and then a tranſient gleam of pleaſure, which,
like an accidental creek through the wall of a dungeon, magnifies the light of
comfort, by peeping in upon obſcurity.</p>
               <p>At the cloſe of every dull day, we naturally look forward in

with 
<q rend="inline">"to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow is a new day;"—"we ſhall

               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:1185300301:71"/> I am led to theſe remarks by the
recollection of my having promiſed to tell the reader what Sir Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney wanted
to make him completely happy. To do this ſuddenly, and without preparation,
would ſeem to ſhew that I know not the way to elevate and ſurpriſe; a
myſtery which more than Mr. Bayes have thought the moſt eſſential
requiſite of an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
               <p>As no reader, therefore, can reaſonably deſire me to violate
a ſtanding rule, I ſhall now proceed to unfold a nice chain of
circumſtances, which will lead directly to the main event.</p>
               <p>In the deſcription that has been given of Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, I
more than doubt I have been ſhrewdly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of that kind of
embelliſhment in which heroes are ſaid to deal when ſpeaking of their
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, and lovers when extolling the charms of their miſtreſſes. In
fact, to ſuppoſe a body of nearly five hundred people, of different
ſexes, ages, and complexions, could be perfectly ſecure from evil in
themſelves, or guarded againſt the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of others, would be to
ſuppoſe an order of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that certainly ſhall not intrude themſelves
here, my intention being to treat of human creatures, the beſt of whom, I am
afraid, are not exempt from frailty. I would only have it underſtood that
vices <pb n="39" facs="tcp:1185300301:72"/> exiſted in Caſtlewick no longer than till they
were found out; at which time the parties were, for the firſt offence,
reprehended; for a ſecond, mulct; for a third, condemned to have no
intercourſe with their neighbours; and, for a fourth, conſidered as
incorrigible; and, without favour or affection, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from the place, and
deprived for ever of any claim to its advantages.</p>
               <p>When this happened, which I will ſay was very ſeldom, the
offenders generally took refuge in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other village, about three miles
diſtant, called Little Hockley, the inhabitants of which place were moſtly
tenants of Lord Hazard; and, as that nobleman had found no great difficulty in
bringing over the men, and the women too, to any of his purpoſes, it may
eaſily be ſuppoſed they were a very likely people to afford ſuch a
left-handed aſylum.</p>
               <p>Little Hockley then was as famous for ſpringes, trammel nets,
and pitched battles, as Caſtlewick was for cricket, quoits, and tranquillity;
and if one was without an attorney, that a proper number of that worthy
fraternity might be kept up, the other maintained two. Nay, a ſpruce young
man, who indeed had been porter to an obſcure druggiſt, in a blind alley
near Roſemary-lane, eſtabliſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf there as an apothecary, who,
when Lord Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard <pb n="40" facs="tcp:1185300301:73"/> firſt began to reſide at his ſeat,
ordered a new ſign, and added to his former qualifications ſurgeon and
man-midwife.</p>
               <p>One great pleaſure of the wicked wights of Little Hockley, was
to torment their more fortunate neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of Caſtlewick, This they effected
by certain railings and backbitings; to which exploits of their fancy, they
added others, which were achieved by means of their fingers; for ſcarcely a
week paſt but ſome hog was hamſtrung, horſe lamed, or houſe dog
hanged. Sucking pigs and chickens diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their ſties and
rooſts, without the aſſiſtance of a fox; the cows were milked in the
night by two-handed urchins, and lambs ran away with by two-legged wolves.</p>
               <p>Theſe depredations ceaſed now and then, upon Sir Sidney's
application to Lord Hazard, but they conſtantly broke out again. In the mean
time, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain defiances were breathed, and ſometimes a few blows
exchanged.</p>
               <p>The vicar was not without frequent apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that ſome
of his pariſhioners, meeting with ſo many inſulting provocations, and
being healthy, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited men, would once for all take ſuch a revenge as
might involve the community in trouble; for one <pb n="41" facs="tcp:1185300301:74"/> or two of
them had been already cited to the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeſſions, where it required
the whole intereſt of Sir Sidney to prevent their paying heavy damages,
though what they did was perhaps in reſentment of ſome inſult offered to
a wife or daughter.</p>
               <p>At the time Lord Hazard petitioned the lords for his divorce,
Sir Sidney was attending with great earneſtneſs his duty in the lower
houſe. Taking advantage of this opportunity, a month had ſcarcely
paſſed before the Hockley men, grown more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious than ever, had
irritated their peaceable neighbours ſo often, that three ſtout bruiſing
matches had already been the conſequence; and though the Hockley boxers would
have cut no contemptible figure in the learned Mr. MENDOZA's ſchool, yet it
ſo happened—perhaps becauſe a right cauſe is half the
victory—the men of Caſtlewick were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors.</p>
               <p>Seeing matters at this extremity, and unwilling to trouble Sir
Sidney, the vicar determined to pay a viſit to the curate of Little Hockley,
for that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, which was a rectory, had not been bleſt with a ſight of
its incumbent for ten years. Indeed that worthy member of the church, who was
alſo a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a gaming club, commuted for the tithes and all other
immunities of his living, and had given up, <pb n="42" facs="tcp:1185300301:75"/> among other
advantages, the right of appointing a curate.</p>
               <p>The gentleman who made this purchaſe lived in the
neighbourhood, and was called Major Malpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. He had diſtinguiſhed
himſelf in the wars of the low countries, when very young, under the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Duke of MALBOROUGH, and was now late in life in quiet poſſeſſion of his
paternal ſeat, and a very fine fortune.</p>
               <p>The Major had a chaplain, who, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, did
not look much like a clergyman. He had been in the wars too, and indeed he
fought much better than he prayed. I will illuſtrate his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by an
anecdote.</p>
               <p>A clergyman being on a viſit to a captain of a man of war, a
ſmart gale ſprung up ſo ſuddenly that the veſſel parted her cable,
and was hurried out to ſea. No harm happened, but it gave the crew a great
deal of trouble. The boatſwain, who in the language of his meſſmates, was
a dry hand, coming upon the forecaſtle, cried, 
<q rend="inline">'Sink me if I did not think as this would be the
caſe. I will be keel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauled if we have had a bit of good luck ſince that
there parſon came aboard. Of all the fiſh that ſwims, I cannot abide a
parſon. I never ſailed <pb n="43" facs="tcp:1185300301:76"/> but once before with a
parſon, and then we had not a fair wind the whole voyage.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Never but once!' ſaid one of his companions,
'why a chaplain's parſon, 'ent he?'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Avaſt that ſlack chatter,' ſaid the
boatſwain, 'a chaplain a parſon, hey!'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why I tell you he is,' ſays the other, 'he
wears black, and ſays prayers.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why then I ſuppoſe,' retorted the
boatſwain, 'the devil's an alderman becauſe he wears horns.—All the
chaplains I ever knew were honeſt hearty cocks: good fellows, who would not
mind mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a curtain of their black gown, to hide a pretty laſs. None of
your grave thinking gentlemen; but roaring boys, who <hi>ſhewing</hi> you
what they are, and <hi>telling</hi> you what they ought to be, leave you to
your choice whether you'll go to heaven by their preaching, or to the
ſouthward by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>This worthy member of the church militant, whoſe name was
Standfaſt, had, in his younger days—for he was now near
fifty—performed as many exploits of the buckiſh kind as ever
diſtinguiſhed <pb n="44" facs="tcp:1185300301:77"/> the Mohawks, Sweaters, or any other
ſet of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rados who uſed formerly to parade the ſtreets of London,
to the terror of every decrepid watchman, and the demolition of his lanthorn.
He was the very man who once propoſed to give the waiter of a coffee-houſe
a rouleau, to ſee <hi>how he would look.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides all this, he had killed his man; and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abſconded to Flanders, he ran away with a nun from a convent, married her,
ſpent her fortune, ſet her adrift, and entered a volunteer in the army,
where the officers—finding him a genteel man—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed of his
function, procured him a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laincy.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation Standfaſt was particularly noticed by
Major Malplaquet, who being a man of ſingular credulity, ſo attached
himſelf to his new acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that he ſoon became his all in all.
Indeed the chaplain had many qualities that rendered him agreeable to the
major. He would drink claret, play at put, and beat a reveille, with any man in
the corps. Beſides theſe winning accompliſhments, he had other
accommodating methods of endearing himſelf to his patron. He often
complimented him with the poſſeſſion of ſome yielding female he had
himſelf grown tired of, and never failed, if huſbands or fathers grew
impertinent and troubleſome, to <pb n="45" facs="tcp:1185300301:78"/> brazen the matter out.
In ſhort, having gained a conſummate knowledge of the world, by a
ſcrupulous hardneſs of belief, a total want of every feeling but
ſelf-intereſt, and a critical exerciſe of obſervation, he penetrated
every man's characteriſtic foible, and worked upon it as he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Such was the Rev. Mr. Standfaſt, private chaplain to Major
Malplaquet, and curate of Little Hock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. To this perſon I am going to
introduce the vicar of Caſtlewick, who, conſcious of the rectitude of his
own intentions, was indulging himſelf in the flattering hope that his
efforts, in conjunction with thoſe of the curate, would effectually make up
every breach between the two contending parties.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>BEING FULL OF PASTIME AND PRODIGALITY.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>To the qualities already celebrated in Tiger
Standfaſt—for ſo had he been nicknamed by his companions, from the
utter impoſſibility of taming him—I ſhall add, that, let him
converſe with whom he might, he, as the phraſe is, knew his man; and was
always provided with ſo many ſhifts and turns, that come what would he was
never off his guard. Beſides he had an admirable knack of ſiding with his
enemy, the better to laugh at him,</p>
               <p>I thought it neceſſary to premiſe this, leſt the reader
ſhould wonder how it came about that the moment he ſaw Mr. Mildman he
ſhould not only welcome him with all imaginable courteſey, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare he
intended, the next morning, to have paid him a viſit, in order to conſult
with him on the very ſubject which had now brought them
together:—adding, as he took the good old vicar by the hand, that he had
a hard time of it indeed, but bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples were terrible things, and if Lord
Hazard <pb n="47" facs="tcp:1185300301:80"/> would encourage his tenants in
idleneſs—which Mr. Mildman's experience muſt have long taught him is
the corner ſtone of the temple of corruption—of what avail were all his
prayers, nay his tears, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing either their duty towards God or their
neighbour.</p>
               <p>The aſtoniſhed vicar could ſcarcely credit his ears. He
had not to learn the general character of Standfaſt; but, on the contrary,
had both heard and believed much ill of him: and indeed, on his way, had
uncharitably, as he now thought, conjured up a number of difficulties in his
mind, which he expected would be thrown in the way of his benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent plan.</p>
               <p>This Standfaſt well knew, and as the firſt blow in argument,
as well as boxing, is a manifeſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, he had the inward
ſatisfaction—I ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward becauſe his features betrayed no ſuch
ſenſation—of ſeeing his antagoniſt ſtruck aghaſt.</p>
               <p>To purſue this firſt blow, therefore, he thus went on. 
<q rend="inline">'I ſee Mr. Mildman you are ſhocked to find I
have no more influence over my pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The vicar, to whom truth was as habitual as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury 
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1185300301:81"/> is to an attorney, with the utmoſt ſimplicity of heart
immediately anſwered: 
<q rend="inline">'You have not at all divined the ſubject of my
aſtoniſhment. I was admiring that the world could be ſo unneceſſarily
ſlanderous to have deſcribed you as a diſſolute and immoral character,
and one who—pardon me for uſing the expreſſion, was a ſcandal to
your cloth; whereas you appear to me—'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Ah,' cried Standfaſt, 'poor deluded wretches
I forgive them. But what do they ſay? It is of conſequence that I ſhould
clear my character to you. Their ſlander I ſmile at, but your ill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion!
What do they ſay, dear Mr. Mildman?'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why Sir,' replied the vicar, 'ſince I ſee
you bear it with a proper firmneſs, I will tell you.'—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Sit down ſir,' ſaid Standfaſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The vicar having complied with his requeſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to
inform him that, in the firſt place, it was ſaid he drank very hard for a
clergyman. 
<q rend="inline">'Not a drop more, in general, than two bottles
at a ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,' ſaid Standfaſt, 'and never more than four.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Four bottles!' exclaimed the vicar.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why what is that;' cried Standfaſt very
calmly, 'if, my dear ſir, you had been in countries where I have, you muſt
have drank. Ay, ay, it is better to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <pb n="49" facs="tcp:1185300301:82"/> off to bed
in liquor than in an ague. Then, between ourſelves, the major is a notable
toper; never ſtirs till the ſixth bottle, though there ſhould be only he
and I to drink it: and I dare not diſoblige my patron: I hate ingratitude. I
only aſk you Mr. Mildman if any thing could induce you to thwart the will of
Sir Sidney?'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Sir,' cried the vicar, with a look of extreme
ſenſibility, 'it is the ſtudy of my life to deſerve his
bounty.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'That was ſpoken,' ſaid Standfaſt, 'too
warmly not to have come from the heart. You muſt, my dear ſir, pledge me in
a glaſs to Sir Sidney's health. Here bring ſome wine.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The vicar, who, though he never was drunk in his life, could
take a glaſs or two, and very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently did at Sir Sidney's table, made no
great difficulty to comply.</p>
               <p>Two bottles of wine were immediately brought, two glaſſes
poured out, and ſoon emptied to the health of the vicar's patron. Standfaſt
aſked Mr. Mildman if he liked his port as well as Sir Sidney's? at the ſame
time excuſing himſelf from drinking any, ſaying that nothing but claret
agreed with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:1185300301:83"/> The vicar commended the wine, but ſaid it
had a dryiſh ſour ſmack after it. 
<q rend="inline">'<hi>Goute de la terreinne,</hi> nothing
elſe,' ſaid Standfaſt, 'it is the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of it.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Perhaps ſo,' ſaid the vicar, 'but to our
buſineſs.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'No ſir,' ſaid Standfaſt, 'you ſhall
purge me of all my ſecret faults. It has long been my ambition to be known to
you, and I promiſe moſt truly, if you can uſe any fair argument before
you go, to convince me of the leaſt impropriety in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, I will amend

               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Sir,' ſaid the vicar, 'it is handſomely
ſaid; and, after this declaration, I will not believe you the man you have
been repreſented to me. You a murderer!'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'A murderer!' echoed Standfaſt, 'I abhor the

               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I dare ſay you do ſir,' cried the vicar,
'and yet the wicked world ſays you killed a man in a duel.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh is that all!' ſaid Standfaſt, 'I was
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to it. Poor Ned—he was a worthy fellow— 
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1185300301:84"/> I had a great regard for him, but he would inſiſt upon
it, ſo I ran him through the body.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Mercy on us,' cried the vicar, 'and do you feel
no remorſe for having the blood of a fellow creature upon your head?'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Not in an affair of honour,' ſaid
Standfaſt. It was impoſſible to be avoided.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Honour!' cried the vicar with great vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence,
'it is a proſtitution of the word. Can it be honour, becauſe a man has
perhaps unwittingly affronted me, to ſhed his blood, and deſolate his
family? Is it honour, becauſe there are men of deſperate fortunes, with
whom it is ſafer to face a piſtol than a halter that I muſt either fear
to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect their villany, or put my life upon a footing with theirs.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Spoken like an oracle, my dear ſir,' ſaid
Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, 'but it will ſometimes unavoidably happen that two men of
perfect honour, who wiſh one another extremely well, ſhall ſuddenly
diſpute, till, grown warm, one or the other ſhall uſe an opprobious
epithet, which his friend cannot brook. What is to be done?—the man
muſt be knocked down you know.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:1185300301:85"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Knocked down!' hollowed the vicar, 'and ſo
make the breach too wide for all poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. No ſir, the
higheſt courage is to pity paſſion, not take advantage of it. Convince a
man into a conceſſion, and your triumph is doubly noble. Why ſhould a
fally of paſſion be ſooner reſented than the ſally of a madman?
Beſides, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your own rules, not to ſpeak of its wickedneſs,
can any thing be ſo ſilly as duelling? A man receives an injury: what is
the ſatisfaction he aſks? why truly he invites the aggreſſor in terms
of perfect politeneſs, to meet him at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, where he requeſts,
as an attonement for the wrong, that his adverſary may exert all his ſkill
to take away his life.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The vicar, who had now drank two glaſſes, made the above
declaration with uncommon vehemence. Standfaſt, in a pretended rapture
embraced him, confeſſed he was become his convert, and filling the
glaſſes for the third time, gave the major for a toaſt.</p>
               <p>This the vicar could not avoid drinking. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined however
it ſhould be the laſt; three glaſſes being at any time his utmoſt
ſtint. He had ſcarcely drank when, whether it was owing to the <hi>goute de
la terreinne,</hi> or being warm upon the ſubject, or what I ſhall not now
take upon me to ſay, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <pb n="53" facs="tcp:1185300301:86"/> he gave manifeſt
ſigns of being diſordered from top to toe. His eyes ſparkled, his head
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came dizzy, and his chair was of the ſame uſe to him as a pole is to a
rope-dancer; for, without it, he aſſuredly would have tumbled down. Nor
could he help teſtifying ſome applauſe at the end of a little
<hi>chanſonette,</hi> which Standfaſt had been negligently ſinging. At
this the latter declared, with a violent oath, that he was the heartieſt
companion he ever knew.</p>
               <p>The vicar blamed him ſeverely for ſwearing, but, ſtamping
his foot to enforce the rebuke, he trod upon the leg of a dog that lay before
the fire. The cur having received a private intimation from his maſter, flew
at the vicar, who, with great difficulty, and an exclamation of 
<q rend="inline">'damn the dog,'</q> got out of his way.</p>
               <p>Standfaſt now fell foul of the vicar; telling him that he
might plainly ſee there were provocations that might induce a man to ſwear;
that the words themſelves were no more than other words; and that men uſed
indiſcriminately God bleſs you, and its oppoſite expreſſion, when
neither a benediction nor a curſe was in their hearts: which he was ſure
was the caſe in relation to the vicar, as the excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation 
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1185300301:87"/> againſt the dog was certainly uttered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the
ſmalleſt premeditated malice.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh ſir,' ſaid poor Mildman, whoſe
ſpeech now became affected, 'I would not wiſh the deſtruction of the
ſmalleſt reptile. As to the poor dumb creature, what he did was natural. I
trod upon him, and he flew at me: I did him an injury, and he reſented
it.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Juſt my caſe,' ſaid Standfaſt, 'in the

               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh no,' cried the vicar; as to the
duel—the duel—you ſee in relation to the duel—a man that is
intoxicated with paſſion—'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'is as bad,' inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Standfaſt, 'as a man

               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh yes,' cried the vicar, 'that is another
ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible evil. When a man is drunk, he feels—that is the liquor mounts

               </p>
               <p>Poor Mildman, ſinking back in his chair, now fell faſt
aſleep; which Standfaſt no ſooner ſaw, than he ordered in two ſturdy
fellows, who were at <pb n="55" facs="tcp:1185300301:88"/> hand, and bid them lay the vicar in a
certain field, where ſome of his flock would be ſure to find him.</p>
               <p>This was all that Standfaſt really meant; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a
perfect ſchool boy at a frolic, and having long indulged a deſire of
touching the vicar on the ſide of his ſobriety, upon hearing of his coming
to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with him, he had infuſed a few grains of crude opium into a
bottle of port, which cauſed that <hi>goute de la terreine</hi> the vicar
complained of, and ſo acted both upon his head and his unſuſpicious
temper as, at the third glaſs, to throw him into a complete ſtate of
intoxication.</p>
               <p>This deception I ſhould have imparted at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of
this chapter, but for my conſtant obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of that neceſſary
etiquette which I hinted to my readers in the beginning of the laſt.</p>
               <p>The two fellows, however, who carried out the vicar, were not
ſo eaſily contented. To get the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon completely into their clutches,
was ſuch a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, that they were determined to make the moſt of it. They
therefore ſtript him of his coat, put him on an old jerkin, patched with a
hundred different colours, ſet him in the middle of a field, upon a broken
chair, propt up by a few ſtakes, to prevent <pb n="56" facs="tcp:1185300301:89"/> him from
falling, where he looked exactly like a figure placed to frighten the
crows.</p>
               <p>Very fortunately for the poor vicar, the clerk and the
ſchoolmaſter paſſed over the field a few minutes after the Hockley men
had left him. They were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Little Hockley with a view to meet the good
man, and learn the ſucceſs of his enterprize; and were ſcarcely within a
hundred yards of the ſuppoſed ſcarecrow when they ſaw it move of
itſelf, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, for there was not a breath of wind ſtirring. Upon
this, looking with more attention, it got upon its legs, ſtaggered two or
three paces, and fell down.</p>
               <p>Perfectly convinced it muſt be a human being, they went up to
it; but what words can deſcribe their aſtoniſhment when they heard the
voice and beheld the features of the vicar.</p>
               <p>The two men who had ſtood aloof now made their appearance.
They were ſoon afterwards joined by almoſt half the village, who, ſeeing
the vicar in the hands of his friends, began to open upon them.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Fine doings indeed,' ſaid one; 'ay, ay, the
ſtill ſow ſucks all the grains.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Yes, yes,' cried another, 'there be black
ſheep at Caſtlewick as well <pb n="57" facs="tcp:1185300301:90"/> as at other places.'</q>
The clerk and ſchoolmaſter retorted, that they were ſure ſome trick had
been played.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Odd rot it,' ſaid a third, 'a reare trick to
be ſure. Here muſt your parſon cum to zee our parſon, and nothing would
zarve un, as he zed, but bleeding the zellers, and zo you do zee, after he had
got mean drunk, we took and geed un an airing in our veeld, to fright away the
crows.'—</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Odds wounds,' cried another, 'your drunken
parſon makes a mortal good ſcarecrow!'</q> at which they all ſet up a
horſe laugh.</p>
               <p>The clerk and the ſchoolmaſter having aſked the vicar
ſeveral queſtions, and found, from his utter incapacity to give a rational
anſwer, they ſtood very little chance of knowing the truth—for as to
a ſingle tittle to his prejudice, nothing could induce them to credit
it—they contented themſelves with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his coat, hat, and wig,
which were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily refuſed; the ringleader ſwearing they ſhould be
put upon a figure of the vicar, and that very night burnt in effigy.</p>
               <p>Seeing that all their attempts to recover theſe ſpoils were
in vain, their next care was how to get <pb n="58" facs="tcp:1185300301:91"/> home their charge,
when, fortunately, a tilted cart happening to go by, they called the driver,
who knowing them, with great readineſs aſſiſted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the vicar to
his vehicle, heartily concerned at his deplorable condition, and vowing revenge
againſt thoſe who had reduced him to it.</p>
               <p>The cart ſet off one way, and the crowd another, ſhouting in
triumph as they bore away their tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies, and ſwearing to exhibit them upon
a pile of faggots as ſoon as it ſhould be dark.</p>
               <p>Whether they did ſo or not will be known here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; but not
in the next chapter, that being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated for another ſubject. Beſides,
the reader may wiſh to be releaſed for a time from the brutes of Little
Hockley. Nay it is not impoſſible but he may, in ſome ſmall degree,
revolt at theſe latter circumſtances. What a ſhocking indignity to make
ſo amiable a man drunk, let him ſwear, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards introduce him as a
ſcarecrow!</p>
               <p>To theſe objections—for I own I am myſelf ſhocked at
the facts—I muſt beg to plead that I am only the hiſtorian of theſe
tranſactions; but, if I were the inventor, I really think that they are the
very cunning of the ſcene; for the more attrocious <pb n="59" facs="tcp:1185300301:92"/> the
Hockley men appear, the more luſtre will be thrown round the worthies of
Caſtlewick.</p>
               <p>As for the ſwearing, I own I had ſome idea of ſmothering
it, but I will prove beyond contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction that it is natural even in the
excellent Mr. Mildman.</p>
               <p>The reader cannot wiſh for a more truly moral character to
illuſtrate the poſition than Doctor JOHNSON. This great man, we are told by
Mr. BOSWEL, while on his tour once made uſe of the words 
<q rend="inline">"what the devil:"</q>—I forget whether it
was on that evening the young lady ſat upon his knee, for then there would
have been no great improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in his feeling the gentleman he mentioned a
little buſy:—but he haſtily recalled himſelf, and corrected his
expreſſion.</p>
               <p>Now 
<q rend="inline">"what the devil,"</q> from Dr. JOHNSON,
perfectly ſober, I inſiſt upon it, is about upon a par with 
<q rend="inline">"damn the dog"</q> from Mr. Mildman, drunk; for
drunkenneſs has the ſame effect upon the ſpirits, whether we fall into it
by accident or deſign. Nay drugs and charms may very likely create a
ſtronger delirium, and I have no manner of doubt but that if Dr. JOHNSON
could that evening have been prevailed upon to drink fermented liquor, 
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1185300301:93"/> it is within bare poſſibility—for I contend for
no more—that he might have whiſpered to his friend BOSWELL that the
lady was a damned fine girl, or ſome ſuch buckiſhneſs.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>STANDFAST, as ſoon as he underſtood what had been done with
the vicar, appeared well enough ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, though he did not fail to declare
that the matter had been carried a great deal too far. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at the major's
in the evening he gave the ſtory in all its perfection; enlarging a little
indeed on one article, which was in ſaying that the vicar drank like a
fiſh:— 
<q rend="inline">'but,' ſaid he, looking very earneſtly at
Mrs. Malplaquet, 'few virtues are ſo practicable as people would feign teach
us to believe. The detection of one hypocrite has in it merit enough to atone
for fifty ſins openly committed. What ſay you major.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why I ſay,' replied the major, 'that
hypocriſy is a low ſin; a kind of rank and file vice; and ought to be
drumed out of every regiment of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt fellows. Don't you think ſo

               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'You may be aſſured the worſt of
hypocrites is he who covers his deceit with the practice of other vices. All
you can do with ſuch a man is not to truſt him too far: but how dreadful it
is to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways doubting a man you would wiſh to think well of. You will
ſay he keeps you a ſtranger to his hypocriſy, and leaves you almoſt
ſecure he is no ſuch character, by openly avowing his other ſins. This

               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well,' ſaid the lady, 'ſince it has gone

               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Perhaps not,' cried the lady, 'enjoying his

               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Very well ſir,' ſaid Mrs. Malplaquet,
'ſince it is a matter of ſuch perfect indifference to you, I will take an

               </p>
               <p>Standfaſt did as he was deſired, the lady's woman made her
appearance, and ſhe retired to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſaying, as ſhe went out,

               </p>
               <p>The two gentlemen being left to themſelves, a ſilence of a
few minutes enſued. At length the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor got up ſuddenly, and having ſhut
the door, and locked it, advanced to Standfaſt in a moſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
ſtride, and uttered, in as determined a tone,

not run a riſk of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperating me without cauſe is as evident; tell me,
therefore, what you know of the matter; for fire me, Mr. Standfaſt, but it
ſhall be explained.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Standfaſt, who had taken good time to ſort his cards, began
now to conſider how he ſhould play his game; and knowing the major's
credulity to his ſtrongeſt ſuit, after ſtipulating for a patient

               <p>

ſincerely believe has been as faultleſs in her conduct as ſhe is
beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in her perſon. You have often ſaid our ſouls were congenial;
and, that though there were no conſanguinity between us, nature made us

deſertion of a recreant pin has diſplayed her ſpreading boſom,
burſting like a lily from its pod, or a friendly ſtile betrayed her taper
leg to my view, I will not deny but it has fired my imagination, and in the

               <p>The remainder of the converſation turned on their former

               <p>At length the major was led off to bed in much

               <p>Before I take my leave of this chapter, I ſhall ſay a word
or two concerning Mrs. Malplaquet.</p>
               <p>This lady, who was one of thoſe living ſacrifices which
avarice offers up at the ſhrine of intereſt, had, to ſay the truth, a

ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable family, were of a younger branch, and, therefore, could give her
but a thouſand pounds. The only man ſhe ever loved had deſerted her, for
a pert piece of deformity with juſt thirty times that ſum. Thus, being
perfectly indifferent what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of herſelf, ſhe gave her hand, as the
good chaplain has already kindly noticed, to the major, out of perfect
obedience to her friends.</p>
               <p>The life ſhe had led ſince—the only pleaſurable
moments of which were thoſe ſhe paſſed alone—may be eaſily
gueſſed. The audacious importunities of Standfaſt were much bolder than
either he or ſhe had deſcribed; and he having repeated them in ſome way
that night ſo as extremely to offend her—though ſhe was remarkable
for complacency and ſweetneſs of temper—her anger had ſo far got
the better of her forbearance, as to force from her that <pb n="72" facs="tcp:1185300301:105"/>
declaration of Standfaſt's diſhonourable intentions, which the reader has
already ſeen he contrived, by the power he had over his patron, ſo to
palliate as to leave her the object of reſentment rather than him.</p>
               <p>I mention this for fear Mrs. Malplaquet, for whom I would wiſh
to intereſt the reader, ſhould be wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſuppoſed to be one of
thoſe outrageouſly vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ladies who are eternally ſinging forth their
own praiſes, leſt the world, from its natural uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs, ſhould
unkindly imagine they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to no praiſe at all:—a practice at
preſent in great and general credit. And really I do not ſee why it
ſhould not; for who ſo proper to be the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald of a man's merits as
himſelf? ſince he is ſurely competent to ſpeak to his own motives, from
a thorough knowledge of whence they originate. And if he ſhould turn the
beſt ſide outward, it ought to be conſidered as a meritorious expedient
to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon a footing with his neighbour, and ſo pay him in his
own coin; appearance being as requiſite to eſtabliſh one ſort of
reputation as paper to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh another; neither of which could
ſuſtain any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid credit without ſuch aſſiſtance: for honour is
a commerce as well as buſineſs, and ſuch ideal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources often prevent
bankruptcies in both.</p>

               <p>THE worthy curate, in his way home, exulting at this new

reflected, the following ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liloquy.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Zounds what an eſcape!—but it is
nothing to a genius like mine. Poor dolt, how gloriouſly I ride him! As to
madam, I fancy ſhe'll tell no more tales. This is reducing things to a
ſyſtem: but I always ſaid it. To palliate an accuſation, if you take a
man by that foible his generoſity, you are ſure to be ſafe. Men are
always liberal when there is nothing required but words.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'But to expedients. This woman is a fool: I had
a ſcheme to her advantage. Her huſband cannot live long, eſpecially as I
drench him, and would ſhe join me, we might make a comfortable thing on't
when once I ſhould have preached his funeral ſermon. Well, if ſhe will
kick down her <pb n="74" facs="tcp:1185300301:107"/> baſket of glaſs ware, that is her
buſineſs. I will try her however once more. I am ſecure from any
impertinent tattling. The major will hear no more complaints. If ſhe comes
to, I ſhall be charmed; for, to ſay the truth, ſhe is a lovely wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: if
not, ſhall I ſtake my intereſt againſt her folly? No, not were ſhe a
Venus.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'To-morrow I will begin the attack, and if ſhe
ſhould not capitulate in a week, I will then appear to raiſe the ſiege;
but it ſhall be only to prepare a mine, which, when once ſprung, ſhall
either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy her, or make her priſoner at the mercy of her conqueror: in
which caſe ſhe will not find in me the continence of POMPEY or
ALEXANDER.—No, no, my buſineſs is to talk of virtue; let fools
practiſe it, who are content to take it for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whether all or any part of Standfaſt's plan was put in
execution will hereafter be ſeen. When he came to the above period, he had
juſt finiſhed his meditation and his walk, and having knocked at his door,
was let in by his confidential ſervant, who beat Scrub out of ſight, in
point of variety in his employments; for as Scrub had one employment for every
day in the week, Mr. Fluſh—for that was his name—had one for
almoſt every day in the year. <pb n="75" facs="tcp:1185300301:108"/> Nor, to ſay the truth,
was there ever any perſon better cut out for a great man's appendage, for I
hope the reader already allows Mr. Standfaſt to be a great man; and as to Mr.
Fluſh, or Mr. Kiddy Fluſh—for he had alſo a nick name—if a
fork be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to a knife, fuel to a fire, a ſcabbard to a ſword, a
bucket to a well, a bailiff to an attorney, or a bully to a bawd, the
ſervices of that faithful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent were eſſentially material and
abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to his worthy principal: nay I queſtion if Kiddy
was not very near, if not altogether as great an original as his maſter.</p>
               <p>As, however, my opinion is of very little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence if my
good reader does not coincide with it, I think it abſolutely incumbent on me
to delineate the portrait of the ſaid Fluſh, or Kiddy—for he was as
often called one as the other—ſo let the claim to ſuperiority reſt
either on the ſide of the man or maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as it ſhall appear by the
drawing; and as it is uſual in portraits to illuſtrate the character by
ſome cymbolical ornament, through the means of which you can lay your finger
on the canvas and ſay this is a general, for he has a truncheon in his hand,
and this a butcher, for he has a noſegay in his boſom, ſo will I give the
like infallible traits to know the characteriſtic marks of Kiddy's moſt
ſtriking qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:1185300301:109"/> As to his perſon, it was, for his
ſize—for he was only four feet eleven inches high—the moſt
compact that ever was ſeen; but then, as if nature had been fearful, had
ſhe finiſhed the front of this well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned ſtructure equal to the
reſt of the work, leſt ſhe ſhould have been tempted to have thrown down
her tools in deſpair, his face was the moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular piece of deformity
that can be conceived.</p>
               <p>His noſe and chin, like the head and tail of a weathercock,
pointed different ways; yet not eaſt and weſt, nor north and ſouth, but
to the zenith and nadir.</p>
               <p>Some were of opinion that he had no mouth when he was born, but
that the operator had made an inciſion to ſerve for one; and that being in
a hurry, and his ſciſſors none of the ſharpeſt, he had not only cut
it in an oblique direction, from the right ſide of the under jaw up to the
left cheek bone, but alſo zig zag; ſo that when he laughed—indeed
laugh he never did—but when he grinned—for his teeth were pretty
even, which lends probability to the buſineſs of the inciſion—</p>
               <p>But pray excuſe me from relating how he looked when he
grinned, till I have deſcribed his eyes; one of which, the left, was
ſmaller than the other, and <pb n="77" facs="tcp:1185300301:110"/> whether it envied the
ſuperior ſize of its neighbour, or was awed by conſcious humility at its
own inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificance, I really cannot ſay, but it fairly ſlunk into the
oppoſite corner, without even deigning, or perhaps daring, to caſt one
ſingle glance to the right, while the other, in triumphant pride, rolled, or
ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goggled about, and appeared itſelf an Argus, looking a hundred ways
at once.</p>
               <p>To theſe unlovely marks—which in females are called
certificates for their honeſty—I muſt add that Kiddy was frightfully
ſeamed with the ſmall pox, and that he received no addition in point of
beauty from an exploſion of gunpowder when he was abroad, which ſtript the
ſkin off his face, except on a ſmall part of one of his cheeks, and one or
two other places; and thereby left ſuch a violent redneſs for ever after,
that his face looked ſomething like a rump ſteak, or rather like red ochre
in the grinding, in which, if you take up the muller, you may ſee an
appearance like branches of trees, which anſwers exactly to ſeams of the
ſmall pox; or, to add one more ſimile, which ſhall take in beard and
all—for his beard, like that of Hudibras, was orange tawny—his
complexion was like a red wine ſyllabub, where here and there appears a
ſplotch of white curd, the whole gently tinged with a ſprinkling of
nutmeg.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:1185300301:111"/> As to the grinning, after I have ſaid
ſo much, I think I ſhould affront the reader by deſcribing it. He knows
every feature now as well as I do, and if he chuſes to call up a grin in his
imagination, and when he has ſo done, does not grin himſelf, I can only
ſay he is not the reader I took him for.</p>
               <p>Kiddy Fluſh had been employed from his youth up to beat the
drum, diſtribute the bills, and ſlang the figures of a puppet ſhew, where
he had learnt a ſmattering of every thing. He could ſcrape the fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
vault on the ſlack wire, ſwear a good round hand, coax the girls, get
boozy, and I am afraid thieve; for if he had not this laſt qualification, I
cannot ſee why they ſhould ſend him hand-cuffed, which they really did,
on board a tranſport whoſe deſtination was to the American
plantations.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, not to conceal the diſgrace, Kiddy was certainly
tranſported to America; from whence he contrived to get re-tranſported to
Ireland. There he found means to get engaged as a drummer in the ſame
regiment where Standfaſt was chaplain. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Kiddy Fluſh was the very
perſon who taught Tiger Standfaſt to beat that reveille, which has been
already celebrated as a <hi>chef d'oeuvre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were I to run through all the ſcenes ſo full of 
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1185300301:112"/> ſrolic, whim, diſſipation, and ſingular
diſſoluteneſs, which were practiſed by this trim tram, this horſe and
his rider, I might as well at once have given the world the adventures of Tiger
Standfaſt and his man Kiddy; but as that is not totally my intention, I
ſhall content myſelf with noticing that theſe worthy aſſociates,
finding themſelves very neceſſary to each other, a league was entered
into between them, that mutual aſſiſtance ſhould be given—to put
the matter a little technically—in all breezes, friſks, plots,
queerings, tricks, humbugs, and bambouzlings, that they might find it expedient
to engage in; that the agreement ſhould be underſtood as a partnerſhip
between them, with this ſole diſtinction, that Fluſh ſhould be openly
conſidered as a ſervant, and in that character be kept in ſubordination
before company, but permitted to ſpeak his mind freely, openly, and without
reſerve when nobody ſhould be preſent.</p>
               <p>Kiddy Fluſh, at the time of his firſt introduction to the
reader—for nothing is ſo advantageous as to bring on your principal
characters with a good grace,—was what is called half gone; in his own
language a little cockiſh: for I muſt tell the reader—and that is
really the laſt explanation I will trouble him with about Kiddy—that,
among the reſt of his oddities, his choice of words was the moſt
ſingular. It was compoſed of the cant terms of both his profeſſions, 
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1185300301:113"/> to which he occaſionally added a miſerable pun, and
now and then a little bad French, which he had picked up on his travels; the
whole interlarded with new-fangled oaths.</p>
               <p>Kiddy had juſt been witneſs to a curious ſcene in the
village, and was burſting to diſcloſe it to his maſter on his arrival.
At the ſame time it muſt be remembered that Standfaſt's head was entirely
filled with what had paſſed at the major's.</p>
               <p>Kiddy then ſcarcely ſuffered his maſter to ſit down
before he began with 
<q rend="inline">'I ſay maſter, there has been rum gig going
forward this evening.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Gig, what do you mean?' ſaid Standfaſt:</q>
his mind ſtill running on his late adventure. 
<q rend="inline">'Nay nothing,' ſaid Fluſh, 'no rang, only we
had like to have come off with tats, that's all. Shiver me if we had not been
cute, we ſhould ſome of us have taken a leap without nobody to hold the
blanket.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Standfaſt thinking he alluded to the ſcrape he had ſo
narrowly got out of, replied, 
<q rend="inline">'why how the devil came you to know any thing
about it?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why Lord love you,' ſaid Kiddy, 'I know the
whole manoeuvre of the thing, and I muſt ſay it was bunglingly
managed.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Bunglingly!' ſaid Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt; 'dam'me if I
think any man in the world <pb n="81" facs="tcp:1185300301:114"/> ever drew himſelf out of
ſuch a hobble with half ſo much grace. To have them both upon me, the old
ſoldier and his wife!'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why maſter, what are you upon?' ſaid
Fluſh. 'The jonſe I means ben't no old ſoldiers, nor their wives; but a
parcel of ſheep biting poltroons—flats—mazards—who,
inſtead of pelting it out like hearties, ſneaked away to the boozing
caſes, and left the enemy maſters of the champ of battle.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>He here acquainted Standfaſt that, at the moment of exhibiting
the effigy of the vicar on its funeral pile, a party of heroes from
Caſtlewick, who had heard from the clerk and the ſchoolmaſter of the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity intended to be offered to their worthy paſtor, ruſhed in,
ſaved thoſe precious relics from the flames, and bore them off in triumph;
while the affrighted Hockleymen fled amazed, ſcarcely offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to
reſiſt:—and it was well they did, for the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car's adherents would
have died on the ſpot rather than have yielded.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'However,' ſaid Fluſh, 'for the honour of
the cauſe I rallied the ſcums, and ſpoke a ſpeech to them, as near as I
can remember, in theſe um here words.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:1185300301:115"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Says I—Splinter your joints, what are you
about? Will you, after this, pretend to call your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hearty culls, rum
codgers, or valiant dickies? You lump the Caſtlewickites!—you be
damned. Don't you ſee the queer kids have made off with the toggies! But,
however, this here I will ſay—you had no maulers, and they took you by
ſurprize. Don't be down hearted then. To day is for them: to-morrow may be

worthies. Thump it out kindly; and then if you loſe, why you die like cocks,
and we will ſing tiddium over your graves. What ſay you my good maſter to
my horation? Was it not great, high, and crackiſh?'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh very great indeed, General Fluſh,'
returned Standfaſt. 'What effect had it?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Effect!' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Fluſh, 'Dam'me it took
like a train. In an hour the kallenge was ſent, a categorical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and

               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Bravo!' cried Standfaſt; 'but remember I know
nothing of this. Stay, a thought ſtrikes me: I can make this matter of uſe:
my pretty piece of temptation yonder is ſqueamiſh: I will think on't: but
it is late. Good night Fluſh:—<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1185300301:116"/> hearten your

buſineſs.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The maſter and man here parted; the one went to ſnooze, as
he called it, and the other to meditate how he could make this accident of
advantage to him.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation, if the reader pleaſe, we will leave them,
and return to the major's, late as it is; as I am anxious to make known what
paſſed in the mind of Mrs. Malplaquet, after ſhe retired to her
appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>That lady had a moſt faithful and honeſt friend in her
handmaid Emma, who was almoſt as ſingular a character as Fluſh, though a
perfect contraſt, for nothing in nature could be more harmleſs.</p>
               <p>Emma was the daughter of a bookſeller in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, who having a
large family, and being in no very flouriſhing circumſtances, was prevailed
on to put her out as a lady's companion. An advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous recommendation
brought her into the care of Mrs. Malplaquet, where ſhe had been now retained
for almoſt three years; in which time ſhe had made herſelf ſo
neceſſary and ſo agreeable to her lady, that <pb n="84" facs="tcp:1185300301:117"/>
nothing I believe could have prevailed on her to part with ſo valuable an
acquiſition.</p>
               <p>What made her company ſo particularly deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, was the
aſtoniſhing fund of information ſhe had treaſured up, by ſitting in
her father's ſhop. Her mind was a kind of circulating library in little, and
I ſincerely wiſh romances were always attended with the ſame good effects
they produced in her; for there is ſcarcely a good moral inculcated by them
that ſhe did not act up to. Not that ſhe had not formed a decided opinion
of writings as well as writers; but ſhe rarely broached that opinion,
think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Madam DACIER that ſilence was the beſt ornament of the
female ſex. It was evident, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that it was wiſely and judiciouſly
choſen, for at the head of her favourite authors ſhe placed Dr. JOHNSON;
though I rather think her great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him muſt have been as a
critic, for the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is known to have entertained a rooted diſlike to
mythology, and indeed every figurative writing which does not ſquare with
what he calls truth and morality; whereas Emma maintained that morality being
the nobleſt drift of literature, thoſe writings were the moſt perfect
which brought virtue into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that ſhe might riſe the more triumphant;
and that ſuch productions received an additional force and beauty from
allegory and mythological alluſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:1185300301:118"/> The various merits of our literary Abigail
will gradually unfold themſelves as we go on. I thought it neceſſary to
ſay ſo much, to account for Mrs. Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaquet's determination of
diſcloſing to her the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Standfaſt's audacity, and to
adviſe with her what ſteps ſhe ſhould take.</p>
               <p>Emma heard the whole affair with great delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and,
pauſing for ſome moments, her lady aſked her of what ſhe was
conſidering?</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I am looking, madam,' ſaid ſhe, 'over the
ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of my mind, to ſee if I have ever read any thing like it, and,
upon recollection, the ſame thing occurs in the Nonjuror, one of CIBBER's
plays; which is taken from the Tartuffe of MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIERE; who had it I believe from
PLAUTUS:—and if I might adviſe, you ſhould ſerve your parſon as
the lady in that play does hers.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'How is that?' ſaid Mrs. Malplaquet, 'for I
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally forget.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why madam,' replied Emma, 'ſhe pretends to be
caught in his ſnare, while ſhe is laying one for him; and placing her
huſband ſo as to over-hear a pretended love ſcene between them, his
villany is detected, and he is turned out of the houſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:1185300301:119"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I like the idea,' ſaid the lady 'of all
things in the world, and, with thy aſſiſtance am ready to ſet about it.
But how Emma if he ſhould turn the tables upon us? for he is very
ſubtle.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I know it very well madam,' ſaid Emma, 'for
at this moment he is making as ſtrong love to me as to yourſelf; but I
promiſe you he finds me a very Pamela.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The lady expreſſed ſome ſurprize at this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and aſked her maid if ſhe was not uneaſy at it.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'On the contrary,' cried Emma, 'I am charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for to reſiſt temptation is the proper exerciſe of virtue, and ſerves
as a kind of moral penance to ſtrengthen us in our duty. Oh I aſſure you
madam you need not be uneaſy: one look from virtue, though a lamb, will as
ſurely make vice crouch, as the lion did at the ſight of Una.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this time Mrs. Malplaquet was undreſt, and ſoon after her
maid retired; which opportunity I ſhall ſeize to account for my having
given two ſuch ſubordinate characters as Fluſh and Emma ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
an introduction.</p>
               <p>To ſay the truth then, I think that, though the 
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1185300301:120"/> clown ſhould ſay no more than is ſet down for him,
yet he ſhould ſay all that is ſet down for him. The devil has been
conſidered by ſome as the principal character in Paradiſe Loſt. Comus
on all hands is allowed to have the better of the lady. Will any one pretend to
ſay Don Quixote would be any thing without Sancho. In all the Spaniſh plays
the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are the principal characters, and I have heard the ſoldier in
WEST's General Wolfe ſpoken of as the beſt figure in the groupe. Emma would
have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended this argument by ſaying that Honor is drawn in as maſterly a
ſtyle as Sophia; and Fluſh would have told you that both man and maſter
were human puppets, moved by the ſame ſlangs. In ſhort, I write for all
readers, and I hope I have ſcarcely a character but ſome one or other will
pitch upon for my hero.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>IN WHICH THE HISTORIAN FULFILS HIS PROMISE TO THE READER.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE challenge from the Hockleymen having been, as Mr. Fluſh
informed us, accepted by the Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickites, a large plain, known by the
name of the cricket green, ſituated near the high road, about midway between
the two villages, was pitched upon for the ſcene of action. Thither repaired
the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants; and there were they drawn up in battle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, every man
poiſing his hedgeſtake, when a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in a poſt chaiſe and four,
who had ordered the poſtilion to mend his pace, when he firſt ſaw a mob
aſſembled, came up, and cried out in a pretty authoritative voice, that if
the inhabitants of Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick did not deſiſt, they ſhould loſe his
favour for ever.</p>
               <p>The Caſtlewickites expected a very different word of command.
Finding however their preſent ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to be no other than Sir Sidney, they
thought proper to throw down what Mr. Fluſh called mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Upon this the
Hockley men began to ſpring <pb n="89" facs="tcp:1185300301:122"/> forward with an exulting
ſhout and would have dealt death among their unarmed enemies had not another
authoritative voice commanded a ſuſpenſion of hoſtilities on their
part.</p>
               <p>This voice proceeded from no leſs a perſon than Mr. Fluſh,
who having deliberately weighed the probable conſequence of ſuch violent
proceedings, began to think they would not be altogether ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with prudence. He conſidered that the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel had originated with
Standfaſt, and that there would be enough to do, without this new outrage, to
ſet matters to rights about the vicar. It was therefore his buſineſs, in
quality of his maſter's friend—by means of which he knew he ſhould be
alſo his own—to ſoften matters; and having an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent opportunity,
owing to this piece of cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice on the part of his adherents, he holloed out,
as loud as his ſhrill pipe would permit him—</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why, pink your livers, what are going for to
do? Would ye, ſtiffen your timbers, go for to be ſuch poltroons as to
bruſh the jackets of a parcel of naked men! Don't you ſee they have canted
away their whackers?'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſpeaking in a lower tone to his lieutenant
general—ſaid he 
<q rend="inline">'The ſhew is over, we muſt let 
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1185300301:123"/> down the rug: ſo do you parley to the hearties, while I
palaver the old rum kid yonder.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this he came up to Sir Sidney, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to
ſtate the caſe in a very advantageous way to his maſter and himſelf,
when their attention was drawn off by a violent ſcreaming at a ſhort
diſtance. Directing their eyes to where the ſound proceeded from, they
ſaw a coach overturned, to which Sir Sidney ran, and was indeed followed by
the whole mob, friends and enemies.</p>
               <p>The coach belonged to Major Malplaquet, and there were in it, at
the time of this accident, that gentleman, his lady, and the reverend Mr.
Standfaſt. Neither the lady nor the curate received any mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial injury, but
the major's head had pitched againſt a ragged ſtone, by which means his
ſkull was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly fractured.</p>
               <p>The combatants, their cauſe of quarrel, and every other
conſideration was now abſorbed in this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy accident.</p>
               <p>The major was with difficulty liſted into his coach, where Sir
Sidney, who had never ſeen him before, offered to accompany him; recommending
his chaiſe to Mrs. Malplaquet, into which Mr. <pb n="91" facs="tcp:1185300301:124"/>
Standfaſt very politely offered to accompany her, with a view, as he ſaid,
of keeping up her ſpirits.</p>
               <p>The lady however thought proper to refuſe both offers, and
inſiſted upon going with her huſband. She, however, did not neglect to
thank Sir Sidney with tears for his kind concern, which indeed was as
manifeſt as if the wounded perſon had been his own brother; for he had by
this time diſpatched three ſervants to different ſurgeons. Not but Mr.
Standfaſt appeared in ſome concern too, but the glances he caſt at the
lady, and the opera tune he ſoftly whiſtled while he aſſiſted his
dying patron, pretty well evinced that his mind ran rather upon the future than
the preſent.</p>
               <p>Sir Sidney would not leave the major a moment, but ſupported
him in the coach with the utmoſt care and tenderneſs all the way home,
where by the time they arrived, and the major was put to bed, arrived alſo
two of the ſurgeons, who agreed that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor had not many hours to live.
They however bled him, prepared bandages, and one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to prepare for
the operation of the trepan: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that their patient ſhould go out of
the world <hi>ſecundum artem.</hi> They were, however, diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for
falling into a delirium, he erupted a blood <pb n="92" facs="tcp:1185300301:125"/>
veſſel—which one of the ſurgeons very judiciouſly obſerved
muſt have been injured by the fall—and was inſtantly
ſuffocated.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Malplaquet did not faint away, nor even go into
hyſterics, upon this occaſion: ſhe felt however very ſeverely. It is
true her tears did not prevent her from thanking Sir Sidney; on the contrary
ſhe acknowledged his ſingular goodneſs in terms of the moſt lively
gratitude; yet her grief, though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared only decent and proper, was from
the heart. She, no more than the vicar, would have wiſhed the deſtruction
of the vileſt reptile; and though ſhe never regarded the major with the
ardour of love, yet he had ever been kind, and ſhe grateful.</p>
               <p>I ſhall paſs over the funeral, at which Sir Sidney, by a
particular invitation from Mrs. Malplaquet, was preſent, and only ſay that
when all proper ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and decent ſolemnities were over, the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
after paying ſome legacies—the principal of which was three thouſand
pounds to the Reverend Mr. Standfaſt, as a trifling acknowledgment of his
diſintereſted and honourable attachment—for the chaplain had
frequently hinted that if a man left any thing to a friend, it had better be in
money, which would prevent litigation. The widow, I ſay, after 
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1185300301:126"/> diſcharging theſe obligations, found herſelf in the
poſſeſſion of a plentiful fortune.</p>
               <p>One circumſtance, however, I muſt not fail to mention, which
is that Mr. Mildman, at the deſire of Mrs. Malplaquet, preached the funeral
ſermon. Nor can I avoid noticing that Sir Sidney furniſhed the epitaph,
which was no more than what follows: 
<q> HERE are depoſited the Remains of <lb/>MAJOR MALPLAQUET,
<lb/>Who feared his Maker, <lb/>Served his Country, <lb/>And left a grateful Widow
to lament his Death, <lb/>And celebrate his inferior Virtues. <lb/>He died March
the 1ſt, 1751. <lb/>Aged 71 Years.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This epitaph Emma declared to be perfect in all its
requiſites; for it told who was the perſon buried, and very conciſely
pointed out his good qualities: you alſo learnt by it when he died, and how
old he was. Nay, ſo much was ſhe pleaſed, that ſhe doubted not, if it
had been written in latin, but that Dr. JOHNSON himſelf muſt have been
perfectly content with it. For her part, ſhe liked it as well as it was; and
that for a very good reaſon, as ſhe humbly conceived, namely, becauſe
ſhe did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <pb n="94" facs="tcp:1185300301:127"/> latin. Indeed ſhe owned
that this was one of the ſpots that candour obliged her to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge were
now and then to be diſcovered in the doctor. He was very angry that Dr.
SMOLLET's epitaph was not written in latin; and when he went into an
apothecary's ſhop with Mr. BOSWELL, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of aſking for ſome
trifling medicine he had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, for, he called for paper, pen, and ink,
and wrote it down in latin.</p>
               <p>Theſe manners and opinions ſhe thought—for nobody was
ſo open to conviction as Emma—were upon erudition what ruſt is upon a
coin, which no one knows the value of but the poſſeſſor.</p>
               <p>Nothing could be ſo clear, ſhe ſaid, as what ſhe
advanced. It was not every body's lot to be bleſt with ſo much learning as
the doctor, which ſhe maintained was very fortunate; for if all men were
arrived at ſuch perfection as himſelf, and were able like him of advancing
incontrovertible <hi>ipſe dixits,</hi> argument would be at an end, and of
courſe litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture along with it. But, as he was the only one who had ever
pretended to be infallible, and who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was ſo, except in a few
trifling points like this, it might ſo happen that latin epitaphs would prove
a ſarcaſm where they were meant to be a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyric; for to praiſe a dead
perſon in a language <pb n="95" facs="tcp:1185300301:128"/> he was unacquainted with while
living, though a tacit, would be a very ſtrong ſatire; beſides being a
cruel inconvenience to his family, who muſt, in this caſe, be obliged to
get the parſon to conſtrue the virtues of the deceaſed, who, after all,
perhaps might not be able to do it off hand. She therefore clearly apprehended,
that as Dr. JOHNSON had iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued a literary bill, enacting that an epitaph
could not be perfect which did not mention the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars before rehearſed,
the next infallible writer—if ever this country ſhould be bleſt with
another, ſhould be petitioned to move, by way of rider, that, for the benefit
of the public in general, all ſuch epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphs ſhould be done in Engliſh. 
<q rend="inline">'But,' ſaid ſhe, finiſhing her harrangue,
'dear Doctor JOHNSON put me in mind at laſt of DOMITIUS AFER, who would be an
orator when he could no longer be audible, and of whom QUINTILIAN ſaid that
he would rather ſail than deſiſt.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is now high time I ſhould account for that ſtrange jumble
of accidents which, in ſo ſhort a time, ſaved an hundred men from bodily
hurt, and yet killed another, who had no concern at all in the fray.</p>
               <p>The reader will recollect that Standfaſt had a ſcheme in
agitation. It was this: He knew Mrs. <pb n="96" facs="tcp:1185300301:129"/> Malplaquet to be of
a moſt tender and compaſſionate temper, and he thought he could wound her
through this weak ſide. He had therefore lured the major and her out, by way
of an afternoon's ride, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when they arrived at the field of battle,
to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt the barbarity of the diſputants, to jump out of the
carriage, and to inſiſt on their going peaceably home.</p>
               <p>This he thought the lady would take in ſuch a light as muſt
greatly forward his deſigns. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of this ſcheme on his
ſide, and the hopes of detecting him on the ſide of Mrs. Malplaquet, made
them, on that afternoon, better ſatisfied with each other than they had been
a long time, and gave the major ſuch real pleaſure, that he declared, as
they were in the carriage, that he never paſſed ſo happy a day in his
life, without divining, poor man, that it would be his laſt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Standfaſt's kind intentions were, however, foreſtalled
by Sir Sidney, who, through an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected diſſolution of parliament, was
poſting down to be rechoſen for the borough of Neitherſide.</p>
               <p>Thus are men ſaved or deſtroyed by the turn of a ſtraw.
Thus the villagers ſlept in whole ſkins: thus the major was hurried into
the other world: thus <pb n="97" facs="tcp:1185300301:130"/> were the deſigns of Mr.
Standfaſt fruſtrated: and thus—for I cannot longer refrain from
declaring it—did Sir Sidney ſee that phantom we formerly ſpoke of:
that diſturber of his peace, to whom he longed to open his mind.</p>
               <p>This is the ſecret I hinted to the reader at the end of the
ſixth chapter, and I only deſire to be reſolved, had I then divulged
it—and thereby have neglected to bring him acquainted with the
heartburnings of the two villages, the contraſt between the two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
the ſingular friendſhip of Standfaſt and the major, the amiable caſt of
Mrs. Malplaquet, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary qualities of her maid, the wonderful and
ſurpriſing talents of Mr. Fluſh, and every other perſon or thing that
conduced to bring about that event which introduced Sir Sidney to Mrs.
Malpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet—whether it would not have been doing things in a bungling and
unworkmanlike manner?</p>
               <p>Beſides I have now no further trouble with theſe people; the
reader is perfectly acquainted with them, and if, in future, they ſhould be
thrown in his way, let them ſpeak for themſelves.</p>
               <p>To be ſure had they never appeared at all, Sir Sidney might
have been heart-whole; but ſince a number of circumſtances are likely to
grow out of <pb n="98" facs="tcp:1185300301:131"/> this accidental interview, I have even given
it as it happened; and ſhall now tell the reader when time had fully
confirmed the baronet in his firſt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the widow, that ſhe was a
very handſome, and, what was more to him, a very valuable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he
reſolved to throw his fortune into her lap, and his perſon into her arms:
and for this purpoſe he was determined to make her a propoſal to that
effect as ſoon as decency ſhould permit it.</p>
               <p>Several reaſons urged him to this: firſt, there was a
ſecret, which, to make amends for my late tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, ſhall be
almoſt immediately diſcloſed to the reader.</p>
               <p>Perhaps my readineſs to indulge him may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to
malevolence; becauſe, in doing ſo, I ſhall be obliged to ſhew a ſpeck
in the character of Sir Sidney, which to ſome may appear black, place it in
what light I will. To this accuſation, however, I plead not guilty;
ſolemnly declaring, that, in the moſt unrighteous moments of his life, I
truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he had as reaſonable a ſtock of piety as any biſhop would
deſire; as much temperance, ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and chaſtity, even in his very
exceſſes, as a gouty alderman under a regimen; and, at any rate, as little
deſire of doing an injury to man, woman, or child as a Lord Chancellor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:1185300301:132"/> This however need not hinder the reader
from exerciſing his own judgment, which I not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he may do, but
alſo with the moſt critical care and nicety; and when all the
circumſtances, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, temptations, motives, and inducements, are clearly
and fairly examined, if he ſhould not acquit Sir Sidney of every thing
worſe than venial frailty, I muſt honeſtly take ſhame to myſelf for
having palmed on the world, as an exemplary character, a mere mortal, made up
of fleſh and blood, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to wiſhes, inclinations, and deſires,
like other men.</p>
               <p>I could ſay certainly that the very excellence of Sir Sidney's
heart ſprung from having as vigorous and turbulent paſſions as any rake
in chriſtendom, and never having improperly given them the reins, but once,
in his life. But ſome of my readers may think that once too much. And as a
blot at back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gammon is no blot till it is hit, and a blot of ink is the
eaſier diſcoverable in proportion to the whiteneſs of the paper on which
it falls; and as an atom is not only magnified, but more deformed, by being
ſeen through a microſcope, ſo I fear this one fault will intrude itſelf
on the reader's remembrance, in the very act of relieving diſtreſſed
genius, or wiping a tear from the cheek of an orphan. If it ſhould be 
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1185300301:133"/> ſo, I muſt ſubmit; for a reader, like a pope, is
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and from his fiat there is no appeal.</p>
               <p>The ſtory of Sir Sidney's incontinence—for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence
it was, and ſuch things, like murder, will out—ſhall be told in the
next chapter, which will finiſh the firſt book of this hiſtory; and while
the reader takes time to conſider what heinous crime this can poſſibly
be, let me beſpeak his charity by informing him that Sir Sidney being once
foreman of a grand jury, whom the judge recommended to find a bill againſt a
murderer, becauſe, as he ſaid, ſuch and ſuch circumſtances were,
which could not have been yet proved, anſwered with an honeſt
fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,—

THIS HISTORY.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE are now going to enter upon action, every thing already
related having happened previous to the time when the reader and I entered the
rookery; or, as Mr. Bayes has it, long before the beginning of this play. We
there left Sir Sidney apparently poſſeſſed of every comfort upon earth,
and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy. This ſeeming paradox has been partly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for; but
let us hope, as Mrs. Malplaquet is now entirely miſtreſs of herſelf, that
the bar to the completion of the baronet's wiſhes may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
               <p>The major has now been dead nearly a twelve-month, and Sir
Sidney has had many opportunities of confirming himſelf in the good opinion
he origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally entertained of the widow; but as, at his time of life, marriage
was no maygame, he honeſtly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to be acquainted with every ſecret
of her <pb n="102" facs="tcp:1185300301:135"/> heart, frankly offering to encourage her by
laying open the exact ſituation of his own.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Malplaquet liked the propoſal ſo well, that ſhe did
not heſitate to give him every information concerning herſelf, which I
formerly gave the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; not forgetting to own, with an ingenuous
frankneſs, that ſhe had loved before; and though, were ſhe to form a
character, ſhe knew of no qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſhe would wiſh to make a part of it
that Sir Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney did not perfectly poſſeſs, yet that warmth of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
which ſhe had formerly cheriſhed would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again, ſhe ſincerely
believed, take place in her heart.</p>
               <p>Sir Sidney ſcarcely heard her to an end, when he
exclaimed— 
<q rend="inline">'Madam, in opening my own heart, I ſhould have
uſed the very ſame words. I have loved, and will imitate you by
confeſſing that the object of my affection, whether alive or dead, is
ſtill dear to me. Your reſemblance of her firſt induced my admiration of
you, and the conſonance of your ſentiments with hers, inſpired me with an
eſteem of the trueſt kind, which perhaps, in marriage, more ſecurely
enſures happineſs than what is generally called love.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'To conſide in your tender boſom the
ſecret of <pb n="103" facs="tcp:1185300301:136"/> my paſſion is now my duty, and if you
will have the patience to hear me, I ſhall ſhew you that thoſe who are
capable of moſt tenderneſs, are effectively the leaſt happy:—but,
as old AESOP ſaid when Prometheus took the clay to form man, he tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered it
with tears.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The lady teſtified great impatience, and the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet
proceeded to ſatisfy her in the following words.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Being about ten years ago in the ſouth of
France, I became acquainted with a gentleman of the name of Le Clerc. He had a
daughter, who, at the time I firſt viſited in the family, was juſt come
home from a convent. Converſations between French and Engliſh too often
turn on the ſubject of religion. As to Mr. Le Clerc, he was not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with continually chanting forth the praiſes of that only and excluſive
worſhip, which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, would procure ſalvation, but he daily
exhorted me to embrace his faith.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'This inconvenience I ſhould have got rid of
by renouncing his acquaintance, or removing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther town: but I had no
ſuch power. I had ſpoken you may be aſſured warmly, though not like an
enthuſiaſt, of our own mild, reaſonable worſhip, <pb n="104" facs="tcp:1185300301:137"/>
repreſenting it as the true medium between fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic zeal and ſubtle
hypocriſy; and though all my arguments ſerved but to root the father's
opinion the ſtronger, I plainly began to perceive I had made a convert of the
daughter.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'In the convent where ſhe boarded lived alſo
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Engliſh ladies, who had already began to ſtagger her
ſentiments:—no wonder then her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion was completed by the man
ſhe loved. Yes madam, plain, downright, and ſincere as I was, a beautiful
girl of nineteen, gentle as a che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rub, and good as an angel, doated on me. Nor
was I behind hand with her, I promiſe you; for my affection was exactly of
that ſort which receives its pleaſure by reflecting what it has
given.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'This was the charm that withheld me. We
conſulted together on the moſt expedient means to gratify our mutual
wiſhes, and though I dreaded the event, it was reſolved that I ſhould
offer my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to her father as the huſband of my dear An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette. I did ſo;
he heard me to an end, and then very explicitly informed me that he would
conſent to my marriage with his daughter upon condition I changed my
religion.</q>

               <p>

prevent her from throwing herſelf into the arms of a heretic.</q>
               </p>

waiting at the door, with a lady in it, who deſired to ſee me immediately.
Gueſs what was my ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize when I beheld my Annette, who told me in as few
words as poſſible that her father was at that moment gone to the abbeſs
of a certain convent, to agree to her entire excluſion from the world; that
ſhe had choſen the moment of his abſence to come to me; and knowing how
much my mind was above the falſe delicacy of ſacrificing to ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
form and unneceſſary ceremony, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at once going off for
ſome town where we might be married in the proteſtant faith.</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'You may be ſure I did not heſitate, but
leaving my affairs to my faithful ſervant, whom I ordered to ſtay and watch
the motions of the enemy, I leaped into the chaiſe, and we were more than
twenty leagues on our road to Geneva, when poor <pb n="106" facs="tcp:1185300301:139"/> Annette
was taken ſo very ill that it was impoſſible for us to proceed.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I was in hopes her indiſpoſition had
proceeded from the fatigue, the hurry of her ſpirits, and thoſe fears which
were natural upon having taken ſo precipitate a reſolution: but I found
myſelf lamentably miſtaken; her diſorder encreaſed, and I was greatly
alarmed for her life. By degrees, however, ſhe recovered, and though very
weak, we apprehended no more dangerous ſymptoms.</q>

us, that is it wonderful when the roſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reviſit her cheeks, and my
whole ſoul was in a trance of happineſs at the proſpect of retriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an
ineſtimable treaſure that, a few days before, I had dreaded to loſe for
ever:—Is it wonderful thus unreſtrained, conſidering ourſelves as
man and wife, we became ſo by every tie but the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. I will not comment
on the circumſtance: perhaps it was inexcuſable: perhaps I ought not to

very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in her—ſcarcely called it a fault, becauſe of the
peculiarity of their ſituation, and their intention of ſetting matters
honourably to rights. Nay ſhe undertook to defend the conduct of the lady; at
which Sir Sidney was ſo greatly charmed, that he ſung forth very laviſhly
in praiſe of the widow's ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, liberality, and candour; and declared

to ſet a company down at Provence ſome time afterwards, where being told,
among other things, of the buſtle Le Clerc had made in ſearching after his

for it had been explained to him that ſhe had gone off with an Engliſh

troubleſome importunity; and in the preſent inſtance it was extremely

                  <p>A CLEARING OF THE COURSE, PREPARATORY TO THE NEXT HEAT.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>As a variety of circumſtances—many of them very
unexpectedly—will ſhortly preſent themſelves to the reader, I think
it neceſſary, as far as I may conceive it our mutual intereſt, to prepare
him for their reception. Indeed it is my intention to adopt this practice
frequently in the courſe of this hiſtory: not in ſuch a way however as to
anticipate any thing. Nay I will not promiſe that theſe explanations
ſhall always be literally what they ſeem; for ſhould I wiſh to cover or
diſguiſe any circumſtance till the proper moment of making it known, I
hope he will not be angry if I put him a little upon a falſe 
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1185300301:149"/> ſcent, by way of exerciſe, to get him an appetite to
the real game, when at laſt he ſhall come up with it.</p>
               <p>I beg however it may be underſtood that theſe falſe lights
are not intended unneceſſarily to lead him aſtray. I know this literary
Will o' th' Wiſp is often introduced; but I diſclaim it as an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
and impotent attempt at a ſpurious wit, which is really an affront to every
intelligent reader. So much indeed do I hold ſuch ſort of trifling a thing
that ought on no account to be excuſed, that I deſire this work may be
conſidered perfect only in proportion as every circumſtance, even the
moſt minute and apparently inſignificant, tends to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the general
effect, and that effect holds out a laudable and improving moral.</p>
               <p>We have heard very little of Standfaſt ſince the death of
Major Malplaquet. This worthy wight, which will be very little doubted, laid
ſtrong ſiege to the widow; for, as I ſaid before, ſhe became, at her
huſband's deceaſe, very wealthy. She, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, having nobody to pleaſe
but herſelf, gave him ſuch a reception as ſoon convinced him that his
hopes were like ſome of the projects of our late builders—fair, and
elegantly finiſhed in the eſtimate, but mere ſkeletons in practice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:1185300301:150"/> Thus diſappointed, he pocketed his
trifle, as he called the three thouſand pounds, and decamped; contenting
himſelf with whiſpering that he might very eaſily have married the widow
if he had thought proper, but knowing ones were not to be taken in: that women
who would ſip in the time of their firſt huſbands, might taſte when
they got a ſecond; and that perhaps, had he been fool enough to be caught, he
might have doated too, and ſo have gotten a luſty chaplain to help him out,
as ſomebody elſe did.</p>
               <p>Theſe groſs jokes were faithfully retailed by Mr. Fluſh.
Not however without a finiſh, that if the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor—meaning
Standfaſt—had braced the drum of matrimony, a certain genteel dapper
cock of an humble ſervant of his would not have feared coming in for a
trevally, or ſo.</p>
               <p>I have never told the reader that Mr. Standfaſt and Mr. Viney
were very intimate friends; and perhaps he has divined why: if not, he will
preſently. The fact however was ſo. They had known each other for ſeveral
years, and indeed upon Viney's being civilly diſmiſſed from Lord Hazard's
houſe, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted Standfaſt, whom he well knew to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Machiavel in domeſtic politics, upon the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt means to preſerve his
declining intereſt in that family.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:1185300301:151"/> The ſtream of Standfaſt's intereſt
going, at that time, in another channel, nothing came of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation; but
the major being dead, and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from the preſence of the widow, the
two friends finding themſelves in the ſame ſituation, and that the
intereſt of one was the intereſt of both, they laid their heads together,
and conſidered of the matter in every point of view. At length they agreed
that nothing could ſo perfectly anſwer their ſeveral wiſhes as to get
Standfaſt into Lord Hazard's family. Take their own words.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">'It is ſuch a damned good ſcheme,' ſaid
Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, 'that I envy you for thinking on it; but I am devliſhly afraid

               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'You are right,' cried Viney, 'let us tread

                  <q rend="inline">'A very dove,' cried Viney; 'a greenhorn.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'That is lucky,' ſaid Standfaſt; 'we have
nothing then to conſider of but the introduction. Does he know any thing of
me?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Only by hearſay,' replied Viney, 'and now I

               <p>

                  <q rend="inline">'But ſtill our intimacy,' ſaid Viney.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'We muſt get over that,' replied Standfaſt.
'Let me ſee—I have it—can't I introduce myſelf to ſome family
in town?—or make my court to any relation of the wife? Zounds, now I
recollect, there is a capital houſe in the city—Ingot, the
wire-drawer—where they make me very welcome. Lord Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard occaſionally
banks there. If I can but get recommended to preach two or three charity
ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and afterwards invited to dine with the ſtewards, the
buſineſs is done. I am ſure Mr. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got is under obligations enow to me;
for I ſo did up his elder brother, by making him genteel, that, in
conſequence of two or three genteel <hi>faux</hi> 
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:1185300301:154"/>
                     <hi>pas,</hi> he at laſt genteelly finiſhed himſelf, by which this
remaining brother got to be head of the firm: and ſo you ſee, Viney, one
good turn deſerves ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'True, true,' ſaid Viney.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So ſaid, ſo done. Standfaſt left a friend to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
for him at Little Hockley, and repaired to town, where he ſo well ſet his
engines to work, that, in ſix months, he not only got introduced to Lord
Hazard, but contrived ſo to ſuſtain the ſeveral eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays made on his
diſpoſition and abilities, that he iſſued from that ordeal through
which the reader may remember my lord was determined his ſon's tutor ſhould
paſs ſo perfect, as to fix himſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely in that nobleman's good
opinion; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed—which I ſhould not think it neceſſary to ſet
down, but by way of regularity—Mr. Standfaſt was the very gentleman
introduced to Lady Hazard in the fourth chapter of the firſt book, in quality
of tutor to her ſon.</p>
               <p>If the reader ſhould wonder how it came to paſs that Lord
Hazard did not know the irregularities of Standfaſt, eſpecially as one was
curate of Little Hockley, and the other landlord, I muſt inform him that his
lordſhip had never viſited his eſtate in Warwickſhire but once after
his ſecond marriage, <pb n="122" facs="tcp:1185300301:155"/> but repaired to a villa about
twenty miles from London, which he bought ſoon after he came of age. Indeed,
as ſoon as he determined to give over his exceſſes, Little Hockley was
the laſt place upon earth he wiſhed to think of. His rents were punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
remitted, and this was all he ever would hear upon the ſubject.</p>
               <p>Neither his reformation, however, nor this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion altered his
character in the opinion of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagers; for as the ſons and daughters of
Little Hock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley were many of them of his getting, and the reſt very ambitious
to be thought ſo, they never dreamt that he had any virtues, but remembered
his vices only, glorying in them, and ſpeaking of them in ſo familiar and
ſhameleſs a manner, as if every meal they taſted was the ſweeter for
being garniſhed with the bread of diſhonour.</p>
               <p>I will not ſuppoſe my reader to be ſo inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced as to
think that Standfaſt's views were merely confined to his intention of
becoming the tutor of Charles; nor, on the other hand, will I believe him ſo
ſagacious as to diſcover what they really were.—We can ſcarcely
credit that a man of this worthy clergyman's conſummate experience in human
traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic had not a material point to carry, eſpecially now 
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1185300301:156"/> he was in partnerſhip with Viney. If it was ſo it
will certainly come in its proper place, which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I had a
wiſh—which I really have not—to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the reader's
pleaſure, cannot poſſibly be here.</p>
               <p>Having fixed Mr. Standfaſt in the family of Lord Hazard, we
will now ſpeak of Mr. Fluſh. That valiant thumper of parchment having
received a handſome ſum and a long leſſon from his quondam maſter,
was transferred, through Viney, to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Lady Hazard, now reduced to
Mrs. O'Shock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſy, and by her again transferred to her ſon, at college.</p>
               <p>I ſhall alſo ſay that Mrs. O'Shockneſy was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at
one or two of the latter conſultations relative to the grand buſineſs;
nor indeed was Fluſh abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely left out. It was, on the contrary, found
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to let him partially into the matter; for ſaid he, very
archly, 
<q rend="inline">'If you don't let me into the maxim of the
thing, how the devil ſhall I be able to move your figures for you?'</q>
               </p>
               <p>A letter from Fluſh to Standfaſt, after he had been ſix
months at Eton, ſhall finiſh this chapter.—I ſhall give it the
reader in his own words.

               <argument>
                  <p>IN WHICH THE GAME BEGINS.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>Mr. STANDFAST no ſooner ſat down in Lord Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard's family
than, like a ſpy in an enemy's camp, he began to reconnoitre its ſituation,
ſtrength, and diſpoſition; to examine whether the body was well united,
whether there were any rotten members, whether centinels dared to ſleep on
their poſts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the commanding officer was moſt loved or
feared—In ſhort, to uſe his own words—though I would not have
the reader infer from thence that he was a cobler in his buſineſs—he
had the length of every foot in the family.</p>
               <p>Not however to be outdone in courteſy, there was not one among
them that had not ſomething to ſay in his favour. My Lord declared he was a
man of ſtrong intellects and ſound erudition. He did not think him a
ſaint, nor wiſh him to be one. Solid argument, for ought he could ſee,
might as well be diſcuſſed over a glaſs as a lamp, and as to gaiety and
careleſſneſs, he dreaded nothing from them, for they could harbour no ill
deſigns. He was a little <pb n="127" facs="tcp:1185300301:160"/> ſurpriſed at hearing from
Standfaſt that he had been frequently in his life taken in, but it gave him
an opportunity of exerciſing his ſagacity by remarking that thoſe who mix
moſt with the world, know leaſt of it:—as it was ſaid of Lord
ANSON, after he had been a prey to ſharpers, that he had been over the world,
but never in it. Upon the whole, he thought Mr. Standfaſt a fair,
undeſigning man, and both a proper tutor for his ſon, and companion for
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Lady Hazard was no leſs prepoſſeſſed in favour of the
tutor. She looked upon him as an unaffected cheerful man, perfectly well bred;
and, as ſhe ſaw his being in the houſe gave her lord particular
ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, really felicitated herſelf upon this acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the
family.</p>
               <p>The butler liked him; for though he could well diſtinguiſh
the different qualities of the wine, yet he never made uſe of his knowledge
to a poor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant's diſadvantage. In ſhort, there was not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in
the family whoſe good opinion he had not been anxious to procure, and one
would have thought with more care and induſtry than belonged to ſuch a
trifle; for he ſo ſucceeded, that he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be a true ſervant's
friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:1185300301:161"/> Mr. Standfaſt had certainly no Iago to
egg him on. He knew however, as well as that ſubtle gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman himſelf,
that trifles light as air in caſes of art are of great uſe, and he doubted
not but they would as much conduce to anſwer the purpoſes of one kind of
hypocriſy as another.</p>
               <p>As to the pupil, he loved Standfaſt like a father, and took
inſtructions from him full as faſt as the other could give it, which,
between ourſelves, not a little embarraſſed the tutor, who, begging Lord
Hazard's pardon, was not ſo profound a ſcholar as that kind patron, in his
liberal warmth, had repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him.</p>
               <p>Standfaſt, feeling this deficiency, preſſed his
lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to carry his ſcheme into execution, of having Charles taught
muſic and painting: thinking, and very rightly, that relieved by thoſe
avocations, he ſhould be able to make his ſtock of learning laſt as long
as he might have occaſion for it.</p>
               <p>Having worked his materials into a proper tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Mr.
Standfaſt now began to think of moulding them to his different purpoſes,
but this required the niceſt care and circumſpection. My Lord plumed
himſelf upon being no novice, and Lady Hazard's amiable heart and
unconquerable duty <pb n="129" facs="tcp:1185300301:162"/> barred all poſſibility of
flattering the moſt diſtant hopes, had there been any ſuch conceived, of
ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering her virtue, or even her prudence.</p>
               <p>Something Mr. Standfaſt was certainly hatching up, and while
it was in contemplation, a moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular circumſtance happened, which
that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did not fail to lay up as food for his project.</p>
               <p>Lord and Lady Hazard were one night in a ſide box at the
playhouſe, where, behind them, ſat a lady and two gentlemen, one of whom
the fair one often called brother, and the other Sir Daniel. At the end of the
amuſement, while they were waiting for their carriage, one of theſe
gentlemen, ſeeing a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon go out of the oppoſite box, exclaimed, 
<q rend="inline">'there he goes, and by God I'll be after
him.'</q> Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon this he darted out of the box, followed by the
other, who warmly entreated him not to be precipitate. Almoſt at the ſame
moment the lady ſhrieked out 
<q rend="inline">'Good God there will be murder,'</q> and
immediately fainted away.</p>
               <p>Neither the good offices of Lord Hazard nor his lady were
wanting to reſtore her, which deſirable event they at length happily
achieved. The lady now begged for heaven's ſake he would have the goodneſs
to conduct her to her coach, which entreaty. <pb n="128" facs="tcp:1185300301:163"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" resp="#OXF" extent="1 page">

                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:1185300301:165"/> Lady
Hazard ſeconded with all her eloquence.—Upon this the lady's footman
from the lobby ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned the coach to the door, and my lord having very
politely ſeen her into it, returned with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to join Lady Hazard.
In his way he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered one of the gentlemen he had ſeen in the box, who
accoſted him with 
<q rend="inline">'I muſt thank you Sir for the civility you
have done me.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Sir,' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Lord Hazard, with great
politeneſs, 'if you mean in reſpect to any attention ſhewn to the lady,
it was but my duty, and I am already thanked.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I dare ſay you are,' replied the other, 'but
that won't go down with me: In ſhort, you are a ſcoundrel, and I inſiſt
upon deciding the matter immediately: it can be done in this
tavern.'—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Sir,' ſaid Lord Hazard, very ſpiritedly, 'I
do not think myſelf obliged to anſwer ſo unprovoked and rude an
aſſault, but as every thing in your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, except this inſult,
calls you gentleman, I attend you Sir.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>At this moment Standfaſt, who had been at the other theatre,
and had, by promiſe, returned to go home with Lord Hazard, came up, and
boldly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired who it was that dared to inſult that noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?—upon
which, a crowd having gathered about, the cry was 
<q rend="inline">'ſettle it in the tavern—ſettle it in
the tavern.'</q> There they now adjourned, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1185300301:166"/> Lord Hazard had diſpatched Standfaſt to his lady, to
requeſt that ſhe would ſtay, for that he ſhould be immediately with
her.</p>
               <p>When they were come to the place of explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Lord Hazard
was more at a loſs than ever.—The gentleman who had inſulted him,
brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him a direct accuſation of carrying on a clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine
correſpondence with his ſiſter, which he ſaid was doubly
diſhonourable, as ſhe was at the point of marriage to a worthy young
baronet.</p>
               <p>This charge was parried by a declaration that, till the
preſent evening, the lord had never ſeen the lady; but the brother treated
this excuſe with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and was for fighting it out inſtantly, mixing
his invectives with ſome inſinuations about a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade. The company,
however, oppoſed his warmth; and the clamour was ſo various and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
that nothing diſtinctly could be underſtood. It was therefore determined,
as with one voice, that the affair ſhould not then be decided; but, as it
ſeemed a matter of delicacy, the diſputants ſhould privately exchange
addreſſes, and meet, with each a friend, to talk the buſineſs over in
the morning. This was immediately complied with, and now arrived Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,
with news that Lady Hazard had quitted the boxes, and he ſuppoſed was gone
home.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:1185300301:167"/> Lord Hazard and Standfaſt betook
themſelves to a hackney coach, in which, on their way, the latter was made
acquainted, as far as my lord knew it, with this myſterious buſineſs.
Standfaſt ſaid it muſt have originated in ſome miſtake, which he
ſuppoſed would be cleared up on the morrow; for, added he, 
<q rend="inline">'you never ſaw the lady before, did you my
lord?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Never in my life,' ſaid Lord Hazard.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Nay,' ſaid Standfaſt, 'if you had, the
fellow need not have made ſuch a piece of work about it, for I am very much
miſtaken or ſhe is one of the right ſort; and very likely the brother is
only a led knight, employed to bully in her cauſe; therefore, were I your
lordſhip, I would take care, if I muſt be forced into a duel, it ſhould
be with a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord declared that he moſt ſincerely believed the lady
was a woman of honour; for, ſaid he, 
<q rend="inline">'I never ſaw more unaffected ſigns of
modeſty. As to the brother, I think with you, that the whole matter will
prove a miſtake, and the affair blow over.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'You know, my lord,' cried Standfaſt, 'I
always yield to you in matters of experience; however, we ſhall ſee, for I
hope I am to have the honour of accompanying your lordſhip
to-morrow.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:1185300301:168"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why I was thinking ſo too,' ſaid my lord,
'but as the gentleman may unfortunately happen to call in my abſence, and as
it would be a kind of tacit reflection on my honour if he ſhould go away
unſatisfied, I will get you to ſtay and receive him. I hope, however to
prevent his coming; for I ſhall be out very early, to convince him that I am
as anxious to bring this buſineſs to a finiſh as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. As to a
ſecond, you know, if it ſhould be neceſſary, I can take our friend
Colonel Tiltly.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>They now arrived at Lord Hazard's houſe, where they found my
lady, who informed them that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtayed till there was no ſoul in the
theatre but herſelf, ſhe prevailed on the box-keeper to find her
ſervants, and ſee her to her coach: 
<q rend="inline">'But, my lord,' ſaid ſhe, 'what could
poſſibly detain you?'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Lord Hazard, who had never conſidered that this queſtion
would certainly be aſked him, was totally unprepared to anſwer it. After
ſome heſitation, however, he faultered out, in great apparent confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<q rend="inline">'Nay not the lady, I aſſure you my
love.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I did not know but ſhe might have had another
fit,' ſaid Lady Hazard: 'in that caſe it would have been inhumanity to have
left her.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:1185300301:169"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why if it had been ſo,' replied my lord,
'where would have been the great crime in it?'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Crime!' returned her ladyſhip, 'I had no idea
of any ſuch thing. Charity is no crime my lord: but really your looks
accuſe you more than I do. I appeal to any body, if I was a jealous wife,
whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſtander-by would blame me if I ſhould be ſuſpicious at this
moment?'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well then upon my honour madam,' ſaid Lord
Hazard, 'I only ſaw the lady to her coach, and was returning to you, but a
particular buſineſs, which happened very unexpectedly, prevented me. This
Mr. Standfaſt knows to be truth.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Standfaſt was here beginning a very handſome excuſe for
his friend, when the lady ſtopt him, and addreſſing herſelf to my lord,
ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">'My dear, if you had not made this laſt
declaration, if your friend here had not ſeconded you, if I had actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
been told that you went home with the lady, that ſhe was an old acquaintance

never have mentioned the ſubject again;—therefore, I beg my lord I may
not hear of it from you.'</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:1185300301:170"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">'This is ridiculous,' ſaid his lordſhip,
'you conjure up a parcel of imaginary ſtuff, and then argue upon it as if it
really exiſted.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'God forbid it ever ſhould exiſt,' ſaid
the lady, 'I only mention it to ſhew, if it really did, what a good wife I

               </p>
               <p>Supper was now brought in, and the ſubject of courſe
dropt.</p>
               <p>The three perſons concerned in it, however, did not ſo
eaſily diſmiſs it from their thoughts as they had from their tongues.
They neither eat much ſupper, nor enjoyed much reſt; and, what appears very
extraordinary, Standfaſt, who one ſhould think was leaſt concerned,
ruminated on it the moſt.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the cataſtrophe of this adventure may bring out what
his cogitations were. Thoſe of Lord and Lady Hazard may be very eaſily
gueſſed. I cannot help, however, remarking that this night was the firſt
they ever ſlept together without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to each other, nor did my lord
ever before leave his lady ſo early, or ſo abruptly.</p>
               <p>If the reader wiſhes the matter to clear up, and 
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1185300301:171"/> that a reconciliation ſhould take place, it is more
than Mr. Standfaſt did, who very archly remarked, as he came down ſtairs in
the morning, that he muſt be a bungling phyſician indeed who did not know
how to irritate as well as to cure.</p>

                  <p>A CONTINUATION OF THE SAME SPORT.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>LADY Hazard having been told by my lord's gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that her
huſband was gone out, and had left word he ſhould not return perhaps till
dinner, ſat down to breakfaſt with Mr. Standfaſt and her ſon Charles,
which meal, however, was very ſhort; for the tutor appeared exceedingly
anxious to introduce his pupil to ſome new author, with whom the young
gentleman ſeemed as evidently to wiſh himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. They therefore
retired to the library, and left the lady to herſelf, who, for ſome minutes
afterwards, continued in a profound reverie, not knowing what to make of her
huſband's having gone out ſo unprecedentedly; for as to the adventure of
the preceding night, ſhe had pretty well made up her mind on it.</p>
               <p>There was not much time to reflect on that or any thing elſe
before the door opened, and a perſon walked into the room, whom Lady Hazard
knew immediately for the very ſame Sir Daniel whom ſhe had ſeen at the
playhouſe. She was for a moment <pb n="138" facs="tcp:1185300301:173"/> aſtoniſhed, but,
recollecting herſelf, ſhe got up, and was making her way towards the bell,
when the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who, for ſome reaſon or other, did not ſeem to
approve of her taking that ſtep, got the ſtart of her, and diſputed the
paſs.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'No, no, my dear madam,' ſaid he, 'that cannot
be; you muſt ſuffer me to prevent you. Beſides, what would your
ſervants ſay, if you called them about you?'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Say Sir!' anſwered the lady, with a look of
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable diſdain, 'one of them was witneſs to your ruffian-like behaviour
laſt night, and would want no order from me to treat you as you
merit—which chaſtiſement if you do not wiſh to provoke, you will

                  <q rend="inline">'Nay then,' cried he, 'there is but a moment,
and by heaven I will not loſe it. Charming creature look with 
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1185300301:174"/> pity on me!'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'What do you mean!' exclaimed Lady Hazard. 'Nay
unhand me, or I'll raiſe the houſe!'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Never,' cried the raviſher; 'this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
ſhall ſeal my happineſs.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Heavens!' cried the lady, 'ſhall I be treated
thus!—is there no one near me!'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Yes madam,' cried Standfaſt, who entered the
room, 'there is one near you, and ever ready thus to treat the villain who
ſhall dare to wrong ſuch beauty and innocence.'</q> So ſaying, he flew at
the raviſher as if he would have throttled him. Then pauſing:— 
<q rend="inline">'But hold,' ſaid he, 'my regard to Lady
Hazard's character protects you in this houſe:—Tell me who you are, and
expect me in half an hour at the Smyrna.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I am called,' ſaid the other, 'Sir Daniel
Dog-bolt, and will not fail you may be aſſured. As to you madam,' ſaid
he, 'I ſincerely regret that I have given you a moment's pain. What a wretch
I am—laſt night—Oh that it had been proſperous, or that I could
blot it from my memory!'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here he left the room, and Mr. Standfaſt ringing the bell, a
ſervant preſently made his appearance, who aſking if he was wanted, was
told only to ſee the gentleman out; to which he anſwered that John 
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1185300301:175"/> had opened the door, and the gentleman offered him half
a guinea, but he would not take it. 
<q rend="inline">'Very well,' ſaid Standfaſt, 'take away the
things;'</q> which while the ſervant was doing, he whiſpered to Lady Hazard
to compoſe herſelf:—for ſhe was on a ſofa, and ſeemed indeed
extremely flurried.</p>
               <p>When the ſervant was gone out of the room, Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
advanced to Lady Hazard, and ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">'I ſhould be extremely unhappy if, zealous in
your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's cauſe, I have done any thing in this buſineſs contrary
to your wiſhes.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>

ſuch an idea, Mr. Standfaſt? A ruffian aſſaulted me, and you came to my
aſſiſtance. Can ſuch conduct demand any thing leſs from me than the
warmeſt thanks.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Madam I beg your pardon,' ſaid Standfaſt,
'but it has been a ſtrange buſineſs altogether. I had for one
moment—perhaps for which I ought never to be forgiven—forgot the
unſullied purity of Lady Hazard; and when I heard from the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that
inſinuation concerning laſt night—but it is impoſſible—I
ſee it—he muſt be a villain. I will anſwer with my life that if

lady, 'I hope I deſerve it. As to laſt night, I will not make a myſtery
of it now, though I thought I had ſufficient reaſon for it then. After my
lord left me, this bold man came back to the box, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me alone, began
to enquire what was become of the lady? I told him that, at my deſire, my
lord had conducted her to her coach; upon which he ſaid he would remain to
thank him for his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, as well as to protect me from any
inſult.—He behaved very properly at firſt, but, as the houſe
thinned, his converſation took quite a different turn. He firſt ſaid he
wondered my lord did not return; then ſaid he was ſurely gone home with the
lady; and at laſt aſſured me that, to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſhe was an old
acquaintance of his. At length he ventured at ſome rude freedoms, but at that
moment John came to aſk me if he ſhould draw off the coach, and ſeeing
what paſſed, did not heſitate to treat the ruffian pretty ſeverely for
his inſolence.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Bleſſings on him for it,' cried

                  <q rend="inline">'I ſuffered myſelf,' ſaid Lady Hazard, 'to

for fear of his reſentment.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Nothing could be more commendable certainly,'
ſaid Standfaſt. 'Inſufferable impudence; in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic place too, a fellow
you had never ſeen before I ſuppoſe. And then to have recourſe to that
ſtale trick of accuſing my lord!—ſo worthy a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo good

               <p>

               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh I can account for that,' ſaid

                  <q rend="inline">'Can you ſir,' ſaid the lady.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'That is to ſay,' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the tutor, 'I

                  <q rend="inline">'Well, and what then?' ſaid the lady, a little
peeviſhly.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'What then,' cried Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, 'really it is
ſo awkward a buſineſs to anſwer, you had better not enquire about it;

implied a wiſh to conceal every thing from you—<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1185300301:180"/>
and yet a breach of confidence where any thing ſo valuable as your peace of

                  <q rend="inline">'By no means,' interrupted the lady; 'nothing
could induce you to forgive yourſelf.'—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'But, my dear madam,' cried Standfaſt, finding
her curioſity ſo tardy, 'the thing cannot remain a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, the

                  <q rend="inline">'Well Sir,' cried the lady, 'it will then be

                  <q rend="inline">'I may not live perhaps till then madam,' ſaid
Standfaſt.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Not live!' ſaid Lady Hazard; 'what do you

                  <q rend="inline">'Surely you forget my appointment,' ſaid

               <p>So ſaying, he ran precipitately down ſtairs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs
of Lady Hazard, who ſeveral times called after him to return. She now
ſummoned John into her preſence, told him to go immediately to the Smyrna
coffee-houſe, and deſire, in her name, that Mr. Standfaſt would come
back, and that if he ſaw any miſchief going on, to call any
aſſiſtance he could to prevent it.</p>

                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:1185300301:181"/> John was ſcarcely out of ſight when
Lady Hazard reflected what a ſtrange errand ſhe had ſent him on, and was
about to ring the bell to diſpatch another ſervant after him, when ſhe
recollected this would be only making bad worſe.</p>
               <p>Thus ſituated, it is impoſſible to deſcribe what ſhe
felt. Anger for my lord—compaſſion for Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt—fear for
herſelf, intruded all at once on her gentle mind; and yet ſhe knew not
why.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of this contention ſhe ſought for her ſon,
with a view in his converſation to alleviate her uneaſineſs, when going
into the library the firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that ſtruck her was Lord Hazard, who had
gone there in ſearch of Standfaſt. Nothing could equal their mutual
ſurpriſe; out of which my lord firſt recovering himſelf, ſaid,

                  <q rend="inline">'My Lord,' ſaid Lady Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, 'I ſhall never

               <p>They were going on in this manner when Charles

                  <q rend="inline">'But you ſay they were gone,' returned the
lady.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well, tell Frill I am going to my dreſſing
room.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Yes, my lady,' ſaid John, and retired.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Lord,' continued Lady Hazard, 'what could I be
thinking about?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'What indeed,' ſaid my lord. 'Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, one
would imagine, not altogether ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous, by your evident
embarraſſment.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'My embarraſſment!' anſwered ſhe,
recollecting her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and then gathering ſtrength from the
conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her integrity, 'no my lord, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
diſingenuous in me, as you ſhall very eaſily be convinced, when you have
ſhewn me all that paſſes in your own heart.'</q> So ſaying ſhe left
the room.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'In my heart,' muttered my lord. 'Why
zounds,'</q>—but ſeeing Charles he reſtrained himſelf. Then
endeavouring to give the matter a different turn, ſaid, with a forced
ſmile, 
<q rend="inline">'I ſuppoſe your mother is angry at my going
out to breakfaſt this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. She would be prudent however not to threaten
me.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here Mr. Standfaſt came into the room, and the moment my lord
ſaw him, he exclaimed 
<q rend="inline">'here I am <pb n="151" facs="tcp:1185300301:186"/> ſound.'</q>

Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I don't know that,' anſwered the patron; 'but
come with me, I have a great deal to tell you.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The lord and the tutor now walked out of the room, and Charles
returned to his ſtudy; not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever without telling Mr. Standfaſt he would
not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to play truant in that manner.</p>
               <p>The lord told his friend, as ſoon as they were in a room by
themſelves, that not finding Colonel Tiltly at home, he had been to Mr.
Snaffle's houſe alone, where he was ſurpriſed to find that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had
been gone out about an hour, it being then pretty early; 
<q rend="inline">'and as I knew,' continued my lord, 'that if he
came you would give him a proper an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I ſat down to wait his return. I
had ſcarcely been there five minutes before his ſiſter came in. Seeing a
ſtranger, as ſhe imagined, ſhe would have retired, but preſently
recollecting me, ſhe paid me ſome well-bred acknowledgments for the
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention I had the pleaſure of paying her laſt night. I anſwered this
civility, and gave my viſit a turn of enquiring after her health;
complimenting her, at the ſame time, on the little prejudice her fears had
done her complexion. She lamented her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb n="152" facs="tcp:1185300301:187"/> was not
at home, but added that ſhe expected him every minute, and begged I would
take break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt.'</q>

               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Though I knew my hot-headed gentleman would
only be ſtill more exaſperated at finding me tete a tete with his

reſolution: for I confeſs to you I never met with a woman more unaffectedly
captivating. You know Standfaſt I like a ſincere candid openneſs of
behaviour, and it was never more ſtrongly manifeſted than in the ſweet

                  <q rend="inline">'In the courſe of our converſation on the
adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of yeſterday evening, I learnt the real cauſe of that ſtrange
medley of circumſtances which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced a coolneſs for the firſt time
between my wife and me, gave me a freſh proof of thy kind
attachment—here Standfaſt bowed—and brought me in company with
the moſt lovely woman my eyes ever beheld.</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'I was aſtoniſhed to find myſelf a great

                  <q rend="inline">'You muſt know this brother of hers is rigidly
tenacious of his ſiſter's honour, for he lies under very great obligations
to this baronet, who is ſhortly to be married to her; and ſhe, on her

give her hand to a man ſhe cannot love, to pay her brother's debt of
gratitude.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'She told you all this, did ſhe my lord?'
ſaid Sandfaſt.</q>

               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh yes,' anſwered my lord; 'ſhe has none of
that ſordid narrowneſs of mind, the reſult of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar ſentiments and

               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well, you have been told that the brother very
abruptly left his ſiſter and her intended huſband in the box, and
ſallied after a gentleman whom he ſaw coming out on the oppoſite ſide.
This man it ſeems paid ſome attention to this ſweet girl, and was
inſulting enough, knowing their circumſtances, to propoſe a ſettlement.
This the brother reſented, and a duel was the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: 
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1185300301:189"/> but no alarming iſſue came of it; for after a mutual
diſcharge of piſtols, the ſeconds interfered, and, upon a promiſe given
by this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, that he would never more preſume to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs Miſs
Snaffle, all anger ſubſided. Laſt week, however, at the maſquerade, if
you recollect, you and I paid particular attention to a lovely figure in the
dreſs of a circaſſian, and to confeſs the truth, while you were gone to
ſee after our party, I made no ſcruple to be very free with her; ſeeing
her entirely alone, and believing her to be one of the frail ſiſterhood.
She ſays indeed I took a number of indecent liberties; and faith the fact
might be ſo, for we had been drinking a great deal of cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne. All this
Miſs Snaffle—for you have ſeen ſhe was the
circaſſian—related to her brother, when he returned from ſeeing
after their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'The brother immediately ſought after me,
directed by the deſcription of my dreſs, all over the rooms, and I dare
ſay we ſhould have had a tilting bout that evening, had I not, upon joining
you, yielded to your preſſing entreaty to return home.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Not finding me, they had nothing now for it but
conjecture who it could be that had ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly inſulted the lady. The
ſuſpicion naturally <pb n="155" facs="tcp:1185300301:190"/> lighted on the gentleman who had
before affronted her, by his offer of a ſettlement. Mr. Snaffle therefore
immediately determined upon an expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with him whenever they ſhould
meet. The firſt time he ſaw him was laſt night at the play, where he
joined him in that ſudden manner you have heard of, and they went together
into the Shakeſpear. Here a very ſingular explanation took place: the
gentleman informed Mr. Snaffle that he had religiouſly adhered to the
promiſe made at the concluſion of their quarrel; that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was
entirely devoted to the lady, and meant to make her honourable propoſals, the
moment he ſhould, by the death of a very near relation, be releaſed from
the reſtraint which, till that event happened, would prevent his having ſo
much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; that being nevertheleſs unalterably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to her, he
determined, as far as he decently could, to watch her inclinations, and being
that evening at the maſquerade, and noticing the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular conduct of a
gentleman there—meaning me—had the curioſity to enquire who that
gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was; in which he ſo well ſucceeded that I was deſcribed as a
reformed rake, who had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried after ruining a whole village.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Thus you ſee, Mr. Snaffle being told all
theſe particulars, no wonder he ſhould accoſt me in the 
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1185300301:191"/> extraordinary manner he did, or that I ſhould find it
neceſſary to make the handſomeſt apology for my conduct, which I was on
the point of doing, when I conſidered how awkward it would be to announce
myſelf. Beſides, it would then have been neceſſary to inform the lady
of the quarrel, which it was eaſy to ſee had been carefully concealed from
her. And again, I did not know whether an apology to her might ſatisfy her
brother. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, to be ingenuous, if I had made a conceſſion, and taken
my leave, it was poſſible I might never ſee her again. All theſe
conſiderations determined me ſtill to conceal myſelf; ſo, after a
thouſand acknowledgments for her condeſcenſion, I left a meſſage for
the brother, and haſtened home to conſult thee.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well my lord,' ſaid Standfaſt, 'I have
heard you to an end, and once more I caution you not to be impoſed upon. In
the firſt place it is a very curious thing that the lady this morning
ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late her love, her poverty, and her gratitude, and the Lord knows
what, to a gentleman ſhe never ſaw till laſt night. It puts me too much

                  <q rend="inline">'Faith,' ſaid my lord, ſcarcely attending to
Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, 'there was one thing eſcaped her that charmed me. Said

               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Rather ſay,' returned my lord, 'too ingenuous

               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I cannot conceive,' ſaid Lord Hazard, 'what

                  <q rend="inline">'I know thy friendſhip and anxiety,' cried my

inclined to think of her, there is no chance for me. Beſides, I give you my

of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to a wife's virtue.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'There my lord,' ſaid Standfaſt, 'is my

the ſafety of your honour.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Enough,' ſaid my lord, 'it ſhall never
deceive thee, nor any one.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Thank you my lord,' ſaid Standfaſt; 'I am
completely ſatisfied: I will not even fear it can deceive itſelf. And now
pray what ſort of an apology do you mean to make to Mr. Snaffle?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'A full and entire one,' ſaid my lord; 'he is
entitled to it, and ſo is the lady. You and I will go together to-morrow
morning, and I dare ſay we ſhall very eaſily laugh off the whole
matter.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:1185300301:194"/> This being agreed on, the converſation
turned on Lady Hazard. Standfaſt ſaid he conceived there was ſome apology
due to her. My lord did not think ſo. He ſaw in her conduct all the
myſterious inquiſitiveneſs of growing jealouſy. It was the firſt time
to be ſure he had ever been diſingenuous with her, but circumſtances
required it. He now began to perceive there might be occurrences which would
admit of treating her with a ſort of laudable dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; which indeed ſhe
ought to be thankful for:—but ſuch was the reſtleſs and
unſatisfied curioſity of wives, that he plainly ſaw ſhe would
infallibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue it into coldneſs and neglect. However, he had ſeen
many inſtances of reſigned acquieſcence in her duty, and therefore he
doubted not but this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs—the truth of which he was determined
to keep a ſecret—though it might ruffle a little, yet it would not
deſtroy their mutual tranquillity.</p>
               <p>He thought it, nevertheleſs, incumbent on him to give the
matter ſome hue of probability, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to appeaſe her at once. To do
this he told her, as if caſually, at dinner, that an affair of honour had
called him out in the morning, but that fortunately every thing had terminated
without bloodſhed.</p>
               <p>The reflection that her huſband had eſcaped ſuch 
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1185300301:195"/> a danger, bore down in Lady Hazard's mind all other
conſiderations, and ſhe was in a moment per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly at eaſe. She chid him
however for preferring a fooliſh punctilio of honour to her peace of mind,
and his own perſonal ſafety; ſaying that his courage was too well
eſtabliſhed to need any ſuch ſavage and unneceſſary proof of it:
and ſhe wondered a brutal cuſtom ſhould ſo prevail, which, far from
exhibiting any trait of true honour, or real ſpirit, was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the
refuge of ſharping knaves, and the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of deſperate
cowards.</p>
               <p>Standfaſt acquieſced in the juſtice of the remark, and
Lord Hazard told her with a ſmile that, had he known ſhe poſſeſſed
ſo much ſpirit, he would have engaged her as his ſecond.</p>
               <p>A ſilent minute, or rather a ſilent quarter of an hour, here
enſued, which would perhaps have laſted much longer had not the arrival of
ſome company put an end to their different cogitations, the ſubject of
which, if the reader will but think a little, by way of making one, it is not
impoſſible but he may be able to gueſs.</p>
               <p>As the converſation now took a mixed turn, and the general
topics of miniſters, puppet-ſhews, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <pb n="161" facs="tcp:1185300301:196"/>
plays, ſceptres, waſh-balls, lottery tickets, loaded dice, lords, monkies,
ſpeakers, parrots, ducheſſes, and drabs, were alternately handled with
ſuch velocity and vociferation, that the parties themſelves were all
talkers, and no hearers.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore content myſelf with barely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
that, while my lord was out of the room, Mr. Standfaſt aſked Lady Hazard
when he ſhould have the honour of communicating the reſult of what ſent
him to the Smyrna.</p>
               <p>The lady agreed to hear it the next morning, at which
Standfaſt ſaid, that then, and every other moment of his life, was
perfectly at the devotion of her ladyſhip, even though it ſhould be
attended with far greater perils than thoſe he had that day
encountered:—ſo ſaying, he heaved a profound ſigh, and joined the
company.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay to the reader in this place? for ſo far
from relieving him from that ſuſpenſe into which I have ſo completely
thrown him, it is certainly my intention to heighten it:—but, however,
there is a remedy for ſuch as are over impatient; for if the tenter-hooks on
which I have ſet them prick too hard, they have nothing <pb n="162" facs="tcp:1185300301:197"/> to do but dip a few pages forward, and they will find them as eaſy
as a cuſhion.</p>

               <p>No ſooner had the complicated din of itinerant retailers
opened the eyes, or rather the ears, of the ſervants—for they were yet
only half awake—in that ſquare where Lord Hazard reſided, than that
noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man left the partner of his bed, to ſeek after Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, who was
ſuddenly awoke by a ſervant from a nap into which he had fallen about half
an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for the pious preceptor had been exerciſing that portion of
his religious duty called watching the greater part of the night.</p>
               <p>In fact, the ſubject which occupied his thoughts was of ſo
complicate and nice a kind, that he had been turning it in his mind with much
care and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and after looking at it in every poſſible
ſituation—rejecting this expedient, adopting that, and at laſt fairly
ſatisfying himſelf as to the meaſures to be taken—he had fallen
aſleep juſt at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant when Phoebus awoke, and walked abroad to
cheer the world, inſpire poets, and engender ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malculae: 
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1185300301:199"/> three employments, according to ſome philoſophers
equally material.</p>
               <p>Mr. Standfaſt underſtanding that his patron re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired his
preſence, now only muttered thoſe curſes which he before had been
thundering againſt the footman. In a few minutes he joined Lord Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, whom
he found full of impatience and anxiety.</p>
               <p>My lord ſaid he wanted to have five minutes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation

muſt candidly confeſs he wiſhed for a pretext for continuing his viſits

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:1185300301:201"/> might give them, ſtrong as they are, ſome ſlight
inclination to pauſe, I think it my duty to endeavour what I can, to
ſuſtain them, to hold them ſecurely where they ought, and where I am
ſure they wiſh invariably to fix.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>My lord paid his lady a very elegant, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a very
ſincere compliment, on her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, attachment, affection, ſenſe of
duty, and right conception of that exquiſite charm in a wife's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct who
is never officiouſly ſolicitous, but ever on the watch to pleaſe. He
remarked however that the breakfaſt would interrupt nothing.</p>
               <p>Here Standfaſt interfering, ſaid, that at breakfaſt
Charles would neceſſarily make one of the party, which he apprehended was
not Lady Hazard's wiſh; he therefore propoſed to defer it till the evening,
or ſome other time, which the lady peremptorily declared ſhe could not
conſent to. Indeed ſhe preſſed ſo hard for a hearing that very
morning, that Standfaſt, at the inſtance of my Lord Hazard, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to
ſet his pupil a taſk in the library imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after breakfaſt, when it
was agreed that the converſation ſhould be reſumed.</p>
               <p>Perhaps Mr. Standfaſt was glad of a moment's pauſe. He
certainly betrayed evident ſymptoms of <pb n="167" facs="tcp:1185300301:202"/>
aſtoniſhment at the firſt part of Lady Hazard's harrangue, which, added
to an affected indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and a forced ſprightlineſs, would have
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to an uninterrupted by-ſtander, a trait or two of ſuſpicion
that the lady's conduct was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agreeable to him: but we have
already hinted that he never ſuffered long under perturbation of any kind.
Thus, whatever inward ſenſations might produce the above effects, they
certainly did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main viſible long enough to be noticed either by the
lord or the lady; and with the aſſiſtance of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning his pupil to
breakfaſt, he had ſo rallied his ſpirits, that he appeared the moſt
cheerful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned of the whole company.</p>
               <p>It was far otherwiſe with my lord. He ſet it down for a
certainty that his lady had, by ſome means, diſcovered all that had paſt,
and divined all that was likely to come. Nevertheleſs, he felt no reluctance
to review his intentions either in one light or the other; but certain
nameleſs ſenſations, which he felt in ſpight of himſelf gave his
behaviour an awkwardneſs which was apparent in proportion as he endeavoured
to hide it.</p>
               <p>Charles was no ſooner informed by his father that he had
ſome particular buſineſs with Mr. Standfaſt, and given his taſk, than
he retired to the library, <pb n="168" facs="tcp:1185300301:203"/> when the lady, after an
apology much in the ſtyle of the former one, acquainted her huſband with
all ſhe knew relative to this ſtrange affair: not even omitting either the
inſult ſhe had received the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, the ſpirited kindneſs of
Standfaſt, or the meſſage ſhe had ſent after him to the Smyrna; which
laſt buſineſs clearly accounted for her conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the library
when John came back; whom ſhe alſo loaded with praiſes, in which
Standfaſt joined, declaring, at the ſame time, that the hiring of that
worthy fellow was a new inſtance that Lord Hazard's knowledge of the world
and judgment of mankind was ſuperior to his, for that John had what he
thought a forbidding countenance, which his lordſhip, however, with a
penetration far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his, had conſtrued into a ſign of bluntneſs and
plain dealing. 
<q rend="inline">'But madam,' ſaid Standfaſt, 'I interrupt
you.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The lady went on, ſaying that her huſband's new and
extraordinary conduct had firſt given her the alarm. In addition to this, a
ſervant had been privy to the treatment ſhe had received from the baronet
at the theatre. Again, he who ought to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected her was out of the way,
when Mr. Standfaſt ſtept forward in her defence. In ſhort, ſuch
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealments and ſuch obligations were very repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to her delicacy,
which ſhe hoped his lordſhip, <pb n="169" facs="tcp:1185300301:204"/> in this caſe, would
conceive was not affected or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained. My lord, ſhe added, was the
proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reward the ſervant and thank Mr. Standfaſt, who, though
a gentleman in years, and perfectly exemplary in his manners, was by no means a
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per confident for her who thought it her firſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to have no
wiſh or thought concealed from her huſband.</p>
               <p>Lord Hazard paſſed ſome very high compliments on the
frankneſs, kindneſs, and great propriety of his lady's declaration and
conduct. He owned he thought the buſineſs of the baronet perfectly
inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable; but theſe and all other conſiderations were ſwallowed up
in the obligations he thought himſelf under to Standfaſt, who took all
theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments with the ſame compoſure as he would have received his
ſalary, or any thing elſe which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be perfectly his own
property.</p>
               <p>His lordſhip deſired this worthy friend, as he called him,
to relate the iſſue of his meeting the baronet at the Smyrna; but
Standfaſt remarked that the harveſt of domeſtic tranquillity this
diſcovery promiſed, belonged entirely to his lordſhip and the amiable
Lady Hazard; that at beſt he was but a privileged gleaner, who ſaw, but
envied not, that abundant happineſs which kindly let fall as much 
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1185300301:205"/> comfort as he deſired, and more, infinitely more than
he deſerved:—he therefore begged to come in his place. 
<q rend="inline">'Beſides,' added he, 'totally ignorant as your
lordſhip is of the motives of theſe people for ſtirring up all this
miſchief, your ſtory cannot but involve ſome awkwardneſs which my after
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation may relieve; for I fancy the baronet has made me more <hi>au
fait</hi> to this buſineſs than either of you.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>His lordſhip, taking this as a friendly hint of the tutor, to
clear up any embarraſſment that might ariſe in his narrative, conſented
to unfold. It is but truth to ſay that his relation was not ſo ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as that of his lady had been; for he did not mention the cauſe of the
quarrel, nor that it yet exiſted; but, on the contrary, ſaid that the whole
was a miſtake, the brother having taken him for another perſon, who had, it
ſeems, offered an inſult to the ſiſter, and that every thing was
amicably made up. He ſunk entirely the circumſtance of his having ſeen
Miſs Snaffle the day before; he alſo forbore to touch on his intention of
paying that lady a ſecond viſit; and indeed on any one point that could
give the ſmalleſt reaſon for conjecture that the whole was any other than
a matter of a common curſory kind, which, in proportion as it was
myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious, ſo it ſunk to nothing, the myſtery being 
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1185300301:206"/> cleared away. He was very much alive however to all
thoſe matters relative to Sir Daniel Dogbolt.—He hoped his friend would
be able to clear them up: for, after all, he ſhould not conſider that part
of the buſineſs at an end without a full and explicit ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for
the inſult his wife had ſuſtained in his abſence.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I am heartily ſorry you were abſent,'
ſaid Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt. 'Proud as I was of chaſtiſing his inſolence, it was
certainly your right.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Lord Hazard acknowledged his obligations, and proceeded to
finiſh his account of this buſineſs, in which, upon the whole, he ſo
well ſucceeded, that Lady Hazard declared ſhe was, except a little
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining curioſity, perfectly ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>Now came the tutor's turn. He began with ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had a much
longer tale to tell than either of them, and that ſince he was not then bound
by the painful duty which had hitherto punctiliouſly kept him from divulging
it, he thought himſelf obliged openly and without reſerve to declare all he
knew on the ſubject. 
<q rend="inline">'But,' added he, 'I believe my lord they are too
artful a ſet for us to place any reliance on what they tell us. What I am
going now to inform you, I forced from the pretty ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet—if 
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1185300301:207"/> he be one—who had the unparalleled inſolence to
inſult this lady, for which—and I hope your lordſhip will not blame
my too forward zeal, I had the honour of calling him to account.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Standfaſt here received the compliments he had once more
fiſhed for, and then went on: not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firſt exclaiming 
<q rend="inline">'Heavens! why my lord a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtranger
would have been entitled to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance I gave, much leſs her
ladyſhip. A meer common exerciſe of humanity. Beſides, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
gave me very little trouble. He fences pretty well, but I ſoon diſarmed
him; and having his life in my power, I made uſe of this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of
extorting from him an account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his aſſociates. He ſaid
he had long ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly admired Lady Hazard, that he had tried many experiments
to get an opportunity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing his paſſion, but found none which
had the ſmalleſt appearance of feaſibility till about three weeks ago, at
the maſquerade, where you may remember we were in a very large
party.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Good God,' cried Lady Hazard, 'I recollect it.
A man certainly did teaze me at the maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, but I took it for ſome
drunken fool, and never gave the matter a ſecond thought.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:1185300301:208"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">'He told me,' ſaid Standfaſt, he firſt
accoſted your lordſhip, drew you away from your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and introduced
you to another, that he might have better opportunity to entertain her
ladyſhip. His words were that he had found an impregnable fortreſs, and
therefore, from that moment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to give up the attack; but accident
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing him into the ſame box at the playhouſe, his wiſhes revived,
and reſolving to make uſe of the occaſion that preſented itſelf
through Mr. Snaffle's quarrel with the gentleman in the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite box, he
dropt him in the crowd, and returned to Lady Hazard juſt as your lordſhip
had gone to conduct Miſs Snaffle to her coach. He confeſſed that, to
ingratiate himſelf, he had told her lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſeveral falſities, ſuch
as that you my lord had an intimacy with Miſs Snaffle, that you were then
gone home with her, all which we have already heard. In ſhort, firſt making
him anſwer many other queſtions, I gave him his life, and ſuffered him to
leave me, after he had proteſted in the moſt ſolemn manner that he would
never dare to mention the name of this lady in future upon any account
whatever.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well, my lord, theſe are the facts: now hear
my comments on them. This man is not a baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, <pb n="174" facs="tcp:1185300301:209"/> neither
is he upon the point of marrying this young lady, nor are they any other than
three ſharpers, who have in ſome way or other a dark plot on the conjugal
peace of your worthy lady and yourſelf. This Sir Daniel did draw you aſide
from your company, and introduced you to this very Miſs Snaffle: with what
deſign is another matter: but it is very extraordinary you ſhould be left
by this baronet with his intended wife, that he might the better introduce
himſelf to Lady Hazard.—Nor am I miſtaken as to the lady, for I heard
a chair called in her name.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'You cannot forget my lord that we at that time
decided that ſhe was a woman of no character. I remember your ſaying with
great earneſtneſs, Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, let us not pay Lady Hazard ſo ill a
compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as to ſpeak to a creature of this ſtamp;—though ſhe is
under the ſame roof with her.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well, my lord, can it be, after what I have
ſaid, that this is a woman of honour? that her brother is a man of the
niceſt feelings? and that Sir Daniel Dogbolt is on the point of marriage with
this woman? No, my lord, it is, as I ſaid, a plot againſt you; however,
thank heaven, armed with a proper confidence in each other, you may deſpiſe
it.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:1185300301:210"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Mr. Standfaſt has placed this matter in its
true light,' ſaid the lady. 'For my part, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly at eaſe, and I am
ſure my lord will thank me for waving all abſurd delicacy, and coming to
this declaration.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here ſeveral ſuitable remarks were made, Mr. Standfaſt was
loaded with thanks, and the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect harmony was reſtored. After this
the lady re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to her dreſſing room, and left the two friends
together.</p>
               <p>They were no ſooner alone than Lord Hazard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan anew to
compliment and thank Mr. Standfaſt. That gentleman aſſured his patron his
thanks were more than he deſerved; and indeed he ſpoke truth. However, no
one upon earth could have bel eved his conduct to be any other than cordial
zeal and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere friendſhip; conformable to which appearances, he ſaid
he would not leave his lordſhip till he had made him a firm promiſe not to
ſee that woman any more, who he muſt now very plainly perceive was a
ſuborned wretch, to aſſiſt in ſome vile plot againſt his domeſtic
peace.</p>
               <p>My lord did not heſitate to make this promiſe; for he was
charmed with the angel-like conduct of <pb n="176" facs="tcp:1185300301:211"/> his lady, and
went ſo far as to ſay that, ſeeing the matter now in the ſame light
with the tutor, he felt himſelf at eaſe with relation to Sir Daniel
Dogbolt, as well as the reſt. Standfaſt hearing this, and being told that
his kindneſs ſhould not go unremembered, went, with the greateſt air of
ſatisfaction to ſeek his pupil.</p>
               <p>As the ſingle articles in my account with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der begin
again to be pretty numerous, I ſhall now, for his ſatisfaction, add them
up, and carry them over. To ſpeak without metaphor, Mr. Standfaſt pleaſe
to unmaſk.</p>
               <p>The preceptor then had, in conjunction with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, concerted
this whole ſcheme. The maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, the playhouſe, the interview, and
every other part of it, was as regularly digeſted as the trial of a felon
before he comes to the bar at the Old Bailey. Mr. Viney had tutored the
gentleman, and Mrs. O'Shockneſy had inſtructed the lady.</p>
               <p>Standfaſt, however, who had contrived the whole plot, was
totally unknown to any of the actors in it. His argument with Viney and Mrs.
O'Shockneſy was, that as they enjoyed the utmoſt they ever could expect
from Lord Hazard, they had no meaſures <pb n="177" facs="tcp:1185300301:212"/> to keep with
him; eſpecially as ever ſo violent a rupture could not deprive either him
of his living, or her of her annuity. On the contrary, that he, Standfaſt,
might in a moment loſe both his ſalary and his expectations, which were not
trifles. He therefore ſtipulated not to be ſeen at all, but in their privy
council; and inſtructions were particularly given to the under villains to be
more cautious in deceiving him than any other of the family.</p>
               <p>This maſter ſtroke could be worthy of no other than
Standfaſt. To teach his tools to look upon him as their enemy, ſecured him
from all poſſibility of detection; for he knew he might laugh at the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of Viney, even if he had any cauſe to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him of
treachery: his own <hi>ipfe dixit</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſufficient to overturn
any thing of that kind with his patron. Nay, notwithſtanding this
infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the reader is almoſt obliged to confeſs that he is innocent;
for his conduct gives the lie direct even to what I have advanced of him. It is
very true that we have ſeen him act the part of a diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted friend,
we have heard him counſel Lord Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to ſhun that very plot he himſelf
had laid for him, and one would think he had ſo far ſucceeded againſt
himſelf—if I may be allowed the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—that theſe
ſwindlers in love ſeem to be turned out of employ: the gentlemen to hunt
other game <pb n="178" facs="tcp:1185300301:213"/> at the hazard table, or perhaps on the
highway, and the lady to ruin apprentices, or gull libidinous elders.</p>
               <p>If the reader thinks thus of Mr. Standfaſt, he is not yet half
acquainted with that conſummate fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator of domeſtic ruin. A ſimple
intrigue, and the common incidental train of diſquietude attending it, would
not have been a luxury inexorable enough for him. In ſhort, Mr. Standfaſt,
put on your maſk again; for we will not ſee your naked heart till we are
prepared to pronounce, by a knowledge of the ſpecies of deſtruction it
meditates—that in the round of human conception there is not ſo
ſhocking a piece of deformity as a complete hypocrite.</p>

VERY UNEXPECTED QUARTER.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE day on which this eclairciſſement took place was
diſtinguiſhed by the cheerfulneſs that ſat on every countenance. Indeed
ſo remarkable was the prevalent good humour, that Mr. Standfaſt was
heartily joined by a great deal of company, who dined at my lord's, when he
ventured an opinion that Hazard houſe had the only roof in town that could
boaſt of a couple perfectly elegant and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly happy. I do not pretend to
aſſert that this declaration was truth; I only ſay the company then
preſent allowed it to be ſo.</p>
               <p>My lord would not read a ſingle letter—for many were
that day brought him—leſt it ſhould give a tinge of
diſſatisfaction that might check the general hilarity. They were all
ordered to be laid in the ſtudy, and it was agreed that he and Standfaſt
ſhould look them over the next morning.</p>
               <p>The whole day being like a ſmooth ſea, which looked the more
beautiful for having been a little <pb n="180" facs="tcp:1185300301:215"/> ruffled, we will
glide over it, as too uniform for any ſtriking remarks, and come to the next,
which was a little more agitated.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as breakfaſt was over, his lordſhip and
Standfaſt, according to agreement, retired to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the letters. Theſe
were ſeven in number, and as four of them in ſome degree relate to this
hiſtory, I ſhall inſert them, together with the remarks of their
examiners. Indeed it was once in my head to have given this whole hiſtory
through that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle, but I conſidered that making my perſonages retire to
their cloſets before they diſcloſed their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents would have thrown
a frigidity over the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; beſides the unavoidable neceſſity of
relating every thing two or three times over, and always partially. Beſides I
may introduce ſome characters who cannot write, and others who will not. Mr.
Standfaſt, for inſtance, would not have been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of half the
cunning I have given him if any thing could have induced him to diſcloſe
his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon paper.</p>
               <p>Upon reflection, therefore, I was determined not to follow a
method, however faſhionable, by which I muſt have made villains confide
their vices, and young ladies their wiſhes—which, if they felt
deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately, they would find difficult to expreſs at all, 
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1185300301:216"/> much leſs in a letter—to their confidants and
clerks of the roads.</p>
               <p>All ſuch matters conſidered, I have left theſe
penny-poſt men in biography to themſelves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to jog on an old
road, where what the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects want of trimming and regulation, will, I
truſt, be made up in ſimple and natural luxuriance. But to the letters
under examination.

                        <p> I take the liberty to write to you concerning your village
of Little Hockley, which, ſince the abſence of your lordſhip, and the
death of Major Malplaquet, has riſen to ſuch maturity in ſingular and
enormous vice as I ſincerely hope cannot be paralleled.</p>
                        <p> I have been obliged to be at the pains of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting
myſelf very ſtrenuouſly in my capacity of magiſtrate, but ſmugglers,
marauders, and other lawleſs characters, for whom this vile place is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

conjunction with the members for the county, to beg the interference of
parliament; but, conceiving that much delicacy was due to your lordſhip in

                        <p> I have no doubt but your lordſhip will rejoice in

               <p>Lord Hazard, as I formerly mentioned, received his rents
regularly from his ſteward, and therefore did not dream of the enormities
carried on at Little Hockley. He now firſt reflected that theſe ſeeds of
vice he had himſelf ſown; and as wickedneſs, like weeds, flouriſhes
beſt where there are no whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome plants to interrupt its growth, he
eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <pb n="186" facs="tcp:1185300301:221"/> and felt the truth of Sir Sidney's
relation; and, therefore, determined to acquaint him that he was as well
diſpoſed as himſelf to perfect ſo deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an undertaking, and that
he ſhould be glad to ſee him for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>After examining another letter or two, they came to the

               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh,' ſaid my lord, 'this is too ſhocking to
paſs. I muſt break the fellow's bones.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:1185300301:222"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Rather get a chairman to do it,' ſaid
Standfaſt. Did not you wait at the raſcal's houſe two hours? Where was he
all that time? No, no, they think you begin to ſmell the matter out, and ſo

               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'But ſtill,' ſaid my lord, 'there is
ſomething curſedly unpleaſant in letting ſuch a ſcoundrel go on with
impunity. I am determined,' conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he, 'to give him manuel chaſtiſement
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I meet him.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Not at all,' cried Standfaſt, 'till he has
eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed his credentials to diſpute a point of honour with your
lordſhip.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well, well, perhaps you are right,' ſaid my
lord, 'you generally ſee things very properly. Let us talk no more of the
damned fellow; he has ſet my blood in a ferment.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The converſation was interrupted by a note from Ingot, in the
city, with whom—as the reader for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly heard from Mr.
Standfaſt—Lord Hazard ſometimes banked. The letter was concerning the
transfer of ſome ſtock, and other buſineſs, on which he required to
ſee his lordſhip at an early opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and my lord, as he was anxious
to adviſe with <pb n="188" facs="tcp:1185300301:223"/> counſel what was beſt to be done
with Mrs. O'Shock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſy and her ſon, thought he could not take a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perer
time than the preſent.</p>
               <p>As his lordſhip went alone into the city, he had leiſure to
revolve in his mind the various buſineſs of the day, and in particular the
ſubject of the letter from Snaffle, which he did not enter into much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Mr. Standfaſt: knowing that an inclination to indulge his feelings would meet
with every poſſible oppoſition from that careful friend.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time, however, that he gave Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt credit
for the goodneſs of his intentions, he could not help thinking the
conjectures of that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman rather preſcient than wiſe, careful than
certain. What was all this mighty buſineſs? Why truly a hot-headed fellow
had inſulted him with great acrimony, and written to him with great
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence. What were Standfaſt's ideas of this matter? That a plot was
laid to diſturb his domeſtic repoſe. In truth it appeared ſo by the
aſſault on his lady, and looked ſomething like it by the tempting
opportunity that had been given him of addreſſing a very beautiful woman.
Well, it was ſo perhaps: in that caſe the proper check had been given to
the firſt; and, as to the latter, he could ſee no ruinous 
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1185300301:224"/> conſequences that would enſue, even were they to
carry their ſcheme into execution. He could not be drawn into a marriage, and
therefore an intrigue was the worſt that could be apprehended. This it was
his buſineſs to avoid; and he certainly ſhould do ſo: but was this any
reaſon why he muſt put up with a moſt provoking and impudent affront? No,
no; he muſt beg leave to underſtand the etiquette of his own honour as well
as Mr. Standfaſt. He was no ſchool boy, and therefore took the liberty to
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the neceſſity of having his actions eternally
inſpected; and as to the affront, which he neither could nor would brook, a
proper time ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be taken to reſent it.</p>
               <p>Lord Hazard had now arrived to that very pitch where Standfaſt
wiſhed to conduct him. The tutor knew that no longer to confide in him was
the only way to keep him ſafe from all conſequences. He waited with
malicious joy for the moment when the patron would voluntarily exclaim, Oh that
I had taken thy advice! Oh that thy ſalutary counſel had been
followed!—and I ſay to the reader, woe be to Lord Hazard if ever the
moment ſhould arrive when ſuch an exclamation ſhall be neceſſary. But
at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent let us change the ſcene.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of his lordſhip's buſineſs with Mr. 
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1185300301:225"/> Ingot, a lady paſſed through the room, whom he
remarked ſpoke nothing but French; for there were two gentlemen with her, one
of whom told Mr. Ingot, in very broken Engliſh, that the lady wiſhed him a
good morning.</p>
               <p>After they were gone, Ingot told my lord that there was
ſomething ſingular in the lady's ſtory, which had been ſo interwoven
with a buſineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning money he had been recommended to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
for her, that he could not but be perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it.</p>
               <p>My lord, who had never any improper curioſity, ſeemed very
indifferent about hearing it; ſaying there were family matters in it not
proper to be divulged.</p>
               <p>Ingot aſſured my lord that was not the caſe at all; on the
contrary, he ſhould tell it to every one he knew; becauſe it placed in a
more glaring point of view the ſcandalous traffic and ſhameful ſelling
and buying of conſciences among the papiſts (a ſect it ſeems for which
Mr. Ingot had a great inveteracy) than any inſtance that had ever come within
his knowledge.</p>
               <p>My Lord ſmiled, and Mr. Ingot continued.— 
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1185300301:226"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">'This lady, when ſhe was very young, having
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately an intrigue with a ſtranger her father had a great averſion
to, ſhe was ſecluded in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, but what convent her lover never could
learn. After ſome time, being perſuaded by her friends that her enamorato
had played her falſe, ſhe was prevailed on to take the veil, and ſhut

                  <q rend="inline">'About a year and a half ago her father died in
England, having long repented of his daughter's ill treatment, and made a will,
leaving her his whole fortune, all veſted in the Engliſh funds. Mind the
conditions: to be ſpent in France, half for her own uſe, and half in pious
donations—provided a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of her vow could be obtained: but,
in default of this, to go to Engliſh charities.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Here was manifeſt the cunning of the

                  <q rend="inline">'Yes, yes,' replied Ingot, with great

               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Spoken as a citizen ſhould ſpeak,' ſaid

               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh ſhe knows nobody here,' cried Ingot.
'Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one gentleman, ſhe has not enquired for a ſingle creature. How
ſhe came to know him is a myſtery to me. It is Sir Sidney Roebuck. I have
promiſed to find him out for her if he be in town.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Then I can tell you, Mr. Ingot, that he is
not,' anſwered my lord. 'I received a letter from him this very morning,

               <p>Here the converſation drew to an end; the lord teſtifying
great pleaſure at the lady's emancipation from confinement, and the citizen
reprobating the folly of immuring healthy young girls, who ought to increaſe
their ſpecies, and produce ſoldiers and ſailors, and thanking his ſtars
that he did not live under the influence of an Italian prieſt, not half ſo

               <argument>
                  <p>THE LAST SUBJECT FOLLOWED UP—A LETTER FROM EMMA, AND
OTHER IMPORTANT MATTER.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THAT very afternoon Lord Hazard wrote an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Sir
Sidney's letter, the receipt of which gave the baronet ſuch ſatisfaction,
that it haſtened his journey to town, where in a few days he arrived; for his
concerns were always in ſo regular a ſtate, that he could at any time leave
them with very ſhort preparation: and Lady Roebuck, who was of all women
living the propereſt wife for ſuch a man, never required much warning to
follow him through all his duties; for ſuch he conceived every one of his
purſuits. It was a duty to diſcharge all truſts, to anſwer all letters,
to return all viſits: but then he took care to undertake nothing but what he
could conveniently do, to receive no viſits but from thoſe he liked, and to
reject all unneceſſary or imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent correſpondents. It was alſo with
him a duty to be merry, and to make others ſo; and he could with equal
eaſe—ay, and without any deviation from his illuſtrious extraction,
which I have already ſaid he was pretty proud of—walk a minuet with a 
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1185300301:230"/> ducheſs, on a birth-night, or crack a facetious jeſt
with a cobler. He might be termed an elegant oddity; and to his peculiarities,
for they were all amiable, did his lady accommodate herſelf.</p>
               <p>Before they ſet out it was agreed to leave the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Emma
with little Annette, who had nearly reached her fourteenth year, and was grown
a moſt beautiful young creature. Lady Roebuck loved her with an intereſting
and lively tenderneſs. She had watched her growing perfections with at
leaſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal care; for had ſhe been twenty times her own daughter, ſhe
could not have paid more attention to her education, or felt more pleaſure at
thoſe dawning accompliſhments with which ſhe promiſed to be remarkably
gifted.</p>
               <p>Emma ſaid ſhe had peruſed her little mind with profound
attention, and though ſhe was no further than the introduction, it was
prefaced with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſuch delightful matter as could not fail to
charm the hearts of all readers. She could diſcern that the ſubject was
intereſting, the moral inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and that goodneſs and virtue were
ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated in every page.</p>
               <p>Annette and Emma then, and the whole village of Caſtlewick
were left under the care of the good <pb n="196" facs="tcp:1185300301:231"/> Mildman, who had
not ſuffered at all in the opinion of Sir Sidney, for having been turned into
a ſcare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crow for the amuſement of the Hockleyites.</p>
               <p>Sir Sidney and his lady arrived in town, at the period above
mentioned; and a card was almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly diſpatched to Lord Hazard,
purporting that the baronet intended to pay him a viſit in a day or two, to
talk over the buſineſs of Little Hockley.</p>
               <p>The peer and the baronet ſoon came to an eligible agreement;
and as leaſes and title deeds were obliged to be conſulted in great plenty,
during the courſe of this negociation, a ſort of cordiality grew between
the leſſor and leſſee. Sir Sidney acknowledged there was great
fairneſs and candour in the conduct of the peer, and facetiouſly remarked
he was glad to ſee ſo good an underſtanding between the upper and lower
houſe. As to my lord, he looked up to Sir Sidney as a being of a ſuperior
kind, and while he penetrated his amiable and benignant views, his only wonder
was that every man of ample poſſeſſions did not do the ſame, ſince
his reward was ſo certain and ſo immenſe.</p>
               <p>The ladies, who I have more than once remarked were to their
huſbands what an echo is to the voice, had alſo commenced ſomething more
than an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; <pb n="197" facs="tcp:1185300301:232"/> which both the huſbands
ſtrongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended. Indeed this intimacy had well nigh brought about a
breach of the bargain between Lord Hazard and Sir Sidney; for the latter had
propoſed to the peer to wave ſigning the writings, and take upon himſelf
the arrangements of Little Hockley. However, whether my lord felt the
ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of Sir Sidney's qualifications for ſuch an undertaking,
whether he thought it ridiculous to expect a harveſt of virtue where he had
only planted vice; whatever in ſhort was the motive, he agreed only to return
to Warwickſhire with Sir Sidney, and give him poſſeſſion of his
bargain, by which means the families would paſs ſome months in the
ſociety of each other.</p>
               <p>Even this was ſome acquiſition, and Sir Sidney, in hopes of
enticing his lordſhip to follow his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, eagerly catched at the
propoſal. Schemes of pleaſure to be executed in the following ſpring and
ſummer engroſſed much of their converſation. Beſides, Lady Hazard was
with child, and it was thought the country would be likely to reſtore her
ſtrength, after ſhe ſhould have lain in; for ſhe was in general very
ill upon thoſe occaſions, and had never ſince Charles had a
child—though ſhe had borne in all four—that did not, after its
birth, pine away, and at length die.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:1185300301:233"/> Pleaſures were alſo chalked out for
Charles and Annette, who was underſtood to be Sir Sidney's daughter by a
former marriage, but that her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died abroad; and the baronet did not
ſpare to hint that an union between the prince and princeſs of the two
rival villages might perhaps cement the general amneſty between all
parties.</p>
               <p>It will be eaſily ſeen that Standfaſt felt awkward in this
ſociety. He too well knew Lady Roebuck's prudence, to ſuppoſe that ſhe
had acquainted Sir Sidney with any of his tricks, and as there ſeemed no
coolneſs on the part of the baronet, theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures were confirmed.
Thus, ſuppoſing the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs would be concluded in a ſhort time
between his patron and Sir Sidney, he was ſo far perfectly at eaſe; but
when he found the ladies were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, he trembled for the
conſequence. How to act? Suppoſe he tried to prevent their meeting? but
that was dangerous and difficult. He once thought of hinting at a diſtance
that ſomething had actually paſſed between him and the lady, which, if
credited, would account for any rancour in her; but, upon maturer reflection,
any of theſe would be to deſert his own grand principle, which was, to be
always prepared with expedients, but never to uſe them except in caſes of
emergency. It would be enough to defend himſelf when he ſhould be
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked; <pb n="199" facs="tcp:1185300301:234"/> and all things conſidered, ſince the lady
had evidently kept the grand point a ſecret from Sir Sidney, it was
poſſible, though barely ſo, that ſhe would not tattle to any one
elſe: yet that curſed female vanity—In ſhort, the gentleman's
combat with himſelf continued a conſiderable while, till at length the
reſult was that he ſhould make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe to go out of town for a month,
and by that means gather from Lord Hazard's letters what was going forward.
Beſides he had another reaſon for taking this reſolution—indeed he
had ſeveral reaſons—which will in due time appear to the
reader:—ſo, having imparted his intention to my lord, and got
permiſſion for Charles to accompany him, the tutor and the pupil ſet out
for the weſt of England, where buſineſs of a particular nature demanded
their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>Thus, moſt of the arrangements before related paſſed in
the abſence of Standfaſt and Charles, whom, as their excurſion has
ſomething remarkable in it, we will join: after I have related a matter that
cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorily paſſed between the two ladies.</p>
               <p>They were talking of Annette, and Lady Sidney, who was by no
means aſhamed of confeſſing ſo much of the truth as ſaved the honour
of Miſs Le Clerc, mentioned the matter exactly as it happened, ſimply 
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1185300301:235"/> with the addition of their being privately married. 
<q rend="inline">'But,' ſaid Lady Hazard, 'are you ſure that
the mother is dead?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Sure!' ſaid Lady Roebuck, 'what doubt can
there be of that? Beſides, at any rate, ſhe is dead to the world.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Perhaps not,' ſaid the other lady. 'Good God,
have you any reaſon for what you ſay?'</q> cried Lady Roebuck. Lady Hazard
here made a very ſerious apology for her imprudence, ſaying, the great
ſimilarity between the ſtory ſhe had heard from her ladyſhip, and one
recently told her by my lord, had ſtruck her ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly, that ſhe had
unwarily betrayed herſelf into thoſe unguarded expreſſions.</p>
               <p>This redoubled Lady Roebuck's anxiety, and ſhe entreated, in
the moſt earneſt manner, to know what all this myſtery meant. 
<q rend="inline">'Nay,' ſaid Lady Hazard, if it be as I
conjecture, it muſt be known, for the lady is determined to ſee Sir Sidney
before ſhe leaves England.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Who?—what lady?'—cried her friend,
'for heaven's ſake keep me no longer in ſuſpence.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Lady Hazard, ſeeing ſhe had advanced ſo far, made no
ſcruple of relating the whole ſtory, as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got told it to my lord, from
firſt to laſt. When ſhe had finiſhed, Lady Roebuck aſked the name of
the lady, which her friend confeſſed ſhe did not know, 
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1185300301:236"/> but ſaid that it would be very eaſy to ſatisfy
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſending to Mr. Ingot.</p>
               <p>This was ſcarcely agreed on before Lady Roebuck received a
letter from her handmaid Emma, which the reader ſhall have in her own words.

As ſays my and Mr. VOLTAIRE's favourite Cato.—A lady called here who
cried over Miſs Annette, and has left a crucifix and ſeveral popiſh
relics, which I cannot ſay pleaſed me, for I have hated the Roman catholics
ever ſince I read the account of the maſſacre of the Hugunots, upon the
feaſt of St. Bartholomew. As to the holy war, ſome of the kings of England
were concerned in that, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="202" facs="tcp:1185300301:237"/> I ſhall not be
ſo wanting in loyalty as to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it; elſe I could a tale
unfold:—But to return to the lady. There were two French gentlemen with
her, one of whom, in very bad broken En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, told me that he believed ſhe
had an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant commiſſion to execute, but he did not know the purport of
it. I wiſh I had underſtood French, I would have made her all her
pilgrimage relate, as faithfully as Othello did his. After ſhe was gone,
which was not till the gentleman had kiſſed both my cheeks, I queſtioned
Miſs concerning their converſation, and ſhe informed me that the lady was
that very ſame ſhe uſed to call Mamma Le Clerc in the convent. The jewels
ſhe has left are for Sir Sidney, and as ſhe had not the pleaſure of
ſeeing him, ſhe did not think proper to leave a packet of papers, but
ſaid ſhe would endeavour to find him in town, and there deliver it to
him.</p>
                        <p>Lord, my dear lady, what can be the meaning of all this?
Miſs Annette was ſo confuſed and terrified, and indeed ſhe did not
underſtand her very well, for they ſpoke it ſeems a different ſort of
French, our young lady having poliſhed hers, and that of the ſtranger being
a good deal provincial: but, as I ſaid, dear Miſs's
confuſion—though very learned writers have doubted whether this admits
of a genetive caſe, and therefore, as I am proud to <pb n="203" facs="tcp:1185300301:238"/>
yield to great authorities, I ought to ſay the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of
Miſs—was ſo great, that ſhe had not the courage to aſk many
queſtions; ſo I entreated her to go back and ſpeak to the French lady
again, who appeared greatly ſurpriſed to find that Sir Sidney was married,
and when Miſs Annette, at my deſire, aſked if ſhe was her mother, ſhe
replied that your ladyſhip was now the only mother to whom ſhe owed any
duty, that ſhe hoped you would treat her kindly, and that Miſs would repay
you with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                        <p>My ſweet little charge is very well, and comes on
ſurpriſingly. I entreated her not to write on this ſubject till I had
your advice. Her letter could not avoid falling into Sir Sidney's hands. This
will ſeem only to concern houſehold affairs, and, as the poet ſays, 
<q> 
                              <l>'Eſcape the ſcythe by being low.'</l>

                        <p>I hate a falſity, but, without a little laudable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
how can we guard againſt the evils of life?—Minerva thought duplicity
ſo neceſſary in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of her favourite Ulyſſes, that ſhe
condeſcended to teach him that heroic quality herſelf.</p>
                        <p>I beg to know, my worthy lady, how I am to 
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1185300301:239"/> act in this affair, and be aſſured, in reſpect of

               <p>This letter ſeemed to clear up the whole buſineſs, and it
being upon enquiry found that the name of the lady his lordſhip ſaw at Mr.
Ingot's houſe was Le Clerc, Lady Roebuck did not ballance a moment in her
mind, as to the probability of her being the mother of Annette.</p>
               <p>In this exigence ſhe conſulted Lady Hazard on what conduct
ſhe ought to purſue, who being, as we have ſeen, no friend to duplicity,
though even of that laudable kind recommended by Emma, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed her, without
delay, to inform Sir Sidney of the whole truth, telling her ſhe had
wonderfully well ſucceeded with her lord by the ſame mode of experiment
within the laſt fortnight.</p>
               <p>This brought forward the ſtory of Miſs Snaffle, which the
reader has ſeen ſo fully inveſtigated, and <pb n="205" facs="tcp:1185300301:240"/> which
not being told without the higheſt enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums on Mr. Standfaſt's attachment
and integrity, and an information that his lordſhip had ſettled an
additional annuity on him, Lady Roebuck teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the greateſt
ſurpriſe, which Lady Hazard perceiving, ſaid, you may well ſhudder at
the world's villany. I wiſh I could prevail with my lord to embrace Sir
Sidney's offer, that I might live always with you in retirement.</p>
               <p>Lady Roebuck, whoſe ſhudderings had been at hearing of
Standfaſt's great influence in the family, was upon the point of ſaying
ſomething which might have led to an inveſtigation of his conduct, not very
favourable to that gentleman; but finding Lady Hazard had given her
ſurpriſe another motive, ſhe contented herſelf for the preſent with
falling in with that lady's conjectures, and ſimply remarking that indeed the
expectations of villains were ſo ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate to the pains they took, and the
riſks they run, that ſhe wondered men became knaves to be infamous, when,
by only being honeſt, they might be happy.</p>

                  <p>THE HERO CLEARED A LITTLE FROM THE COBWEBS OF THE LIBRARY.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I MAKE no ſcruple to confeſs that my leaving the
buſineſs of Miſs Le Clerc and the poſſibility of Standfaſt's
detection in ſuch a ſtate of uncertainty as they appeared to be at the end
of the laſt chapter, is taking a liberty with the reader, and, what is
worſe, with the ladies. But the conſideration of having ſo long forborne
to introduce my hero, who, by the way, would be the laſt to excuſe me for
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of the ſmalleſt incivility to the fair ſex, has got the
better of all others:—for indeed the circumſtances in this hiſtory
are ſo various, and follow in ſuch quick ſucceſſion, that really if I
do not uſe ſome expedition to bring him forward, I might as well have no
hero at all. Juſt ſo far how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have nothing to reproach myſelf with;
for, though hitherto he has ſaid very little, I can aſſure the reader he
has thought a great deal. To what purpoſe will hereafter appear. At preſent
I ſhall proceed to the examination of his good and bad qualities, a portion
of each—for I am afraid there is nothing perfect in this world—he
certainly had; <pb n="207" facs="tcp:1185300301:242"/> and having cleared away the ſhores, and
made every other proper preparation—for we may well give him fair
play—fairly launch him on the ocean of life, where we ſhall ſee him
ſteming many adverſe gales of fortune, in which it will be difficult to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whether moſt to admire his diſtreſs or his fortitude.</p>
               <p>I certainly had ſome apprehenſions that having ſuffered a
fourth part of this work to paſs without approaching to ſuch a
neceſſary buſineſs, the reader might perhaps be given to imagine that I
called Charles Hazard the hero out of facetiouſneſs, and merely by
inference and deduction, and ſo uſe him as a painter does a layman, which
ſtands in all the attitudes, bears the helmet, drapery, or poll parrot of the
hero or heroine, and yet, though he play this reſpectable part, is never
known perſonally to the ſpectators.</p>
               <p>To ſay the truth, I have often been wickedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to
wiſh that many heroes I have met with in my life had been ſo dealt with,
and it is not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but ſome of my readers may retort the
cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy; for it ſo happens that particular people find in theſe ſaid
heroes particular qualities, which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally being adventitious, it is fifty
to one if a hero-maker thinks of them, and, in the abſence of theſe 
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1185300301:243"/> qualities, though the gentleman ſhould be
poſſeſſed of ever ſo long a catalogue of real and permanent virtues,
he ſinks to a nonentity, in the opinion of ſuch critics, becauſe he does
not happen to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened with their favourite animating principle.</p>
               <p>I cannot give a ſtronger inſtance of what I have advanced
than by producing the names of two of the greateſt men in their way that ever
lived:—I mean ALEXANDER of Macedon the great warrior, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEXANDER of
Twickenham the great poet.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER the warrior would not have given three-pence for all
the noiſy applauſe and bellowing acclamations of the largeſt populace
that ever aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, if they had not hailed him ſon of Jupiter; and
ALEXANDER the poet—according to Dr. JOHN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON—continually made
himſelf wretched leſt the world ſhould fancy him to be the ſon of
nobody; yet I appeal to any one if the fighting hero had been the offspring of
a beggar, and the writing hero the heir of a king, whether one would have cut
throats, or the other 
<q rend="inline">'liſped numbers'</q> in greater perfection.
Neither of theſe could conquer his favourite foible, which it is admirable to
remark proceeded in the warrior from hope, and in the poet from fear. This
imaginary honour in one, and blot in the other, nothing could efface; for
vainly did ALEXANDER's <pb n="209" facs="tcp:1185300301:244"/> mother ridicule the
prepoſterous folly of her ſon, ſaying, 
<q rend="inline">'huſh, huſh, my dear boy, you don't
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider you are bringing me into a ſcrape, for if you talk ſo loud
about being the ſon of Jupiter, you will make Juno angry with
me:'</q>—and equally unſucceſsful were the efforts of POPE's friends,
who it is ſaid told him it was ridiculous to lament that he was the ſon of
a tradeſman, when the father of ESCHINES, the Socratic philoſopher, was but
a ſauſage-maker.</p>
               <p>A hundred inſtances may be adduced, perhaps a thouſand, to
prove upon what cobweb qualities the very eſſence of a hero often depends;
but none I believe can be found ſtronger than thoſe I have given. Let us
then ſettle the diſpute in this way: Let all matters relative to Charles
Hazard, which are totally dependant upon chance, be conſidered as out of his
power to alter or amend, and all qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, good, bad, or indifferent, which
are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of his ſerious reflections, be underſtood as his act and
deed, and cenſured or praiſed accordingly.</p>
               <p>Charles had been left from his infancy in the quiet and
unwearied purſuit of every uſeful and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant accompliſhment. All
theſe advantages had been procured for him at home, under a tutor who
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had ſome taſte, and a father who had more; <pb n="210" facs="tcp:1185300301:245"/> both of whom were perfectly well ſatisfied with his progreſs.
His ardour had been ſo unremitting, that perfection, by the help of
perſeverence, ſeemed to be within his reach. I therefore left him to
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for why ſhould I interrupt him in the midſt of ſo laudable a
career?—eſpecially when thoſe very advantages are good
recommendations to the reader.</p>
               <p>Having untied him, however, a little from his mother's apron
ſtrings, I ſhall now fairly truſt him to the bent of his
inclination:—and this for ſeveral good reaſons:—one is, that my
veracity as a hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian obliges me to it, for Standfaſt declared to
Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, before he ſet out—firſt indeed giving him ſome other
inſtructions—he ſhould try what mettle the youngſter was made
of.</p>
               <p>Charles was at this time ſomething more than ſeventeen, ſo
that he took the field young, as did his nameſake of Sweden. He was not,
however, at all like that great man in any reſpect, except in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that no
Charles the Twelfth upon earth could be a more rigid obſerver of his word;
for, as the Swediſh Charles could never be perſwaded by any body, the
Engliſh Charles placed an implicit faith in every body, and as the fighting
hero hated the ſight of a woman, the ſcientific hero was charmed with every
woman he ſaw.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:1185300301:246"/> Charles—for there is no hiding
it—was very amorous, and very credulous. His credulity, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was not
of that kind begot by adulation upon impudence; he was too modeſt to be vain;
but when a plauſible appeal was made to the ſoftneſs of his manners, the
ſtrength of his ſenſibility, or the excellence of his heart, his expanded
ſoul cheriſhed the fiction becauſe it wore the garb of truth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in him, credulity was a virtue: and yet virtue would be in much leſs repute
than it is—for which there is little neceſſity—if it met with
no better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. His propenſity to the ſofter paſſions were, though
ſo young, of a pretty robuſt kind, for he had already attacked, and that
very briſkly, fat Betty, who, by force of arms, or rather fiſts, defended
her virtue. Nor was he leſs ſolicitous with Lady Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard's woman, before
whom, about a week previous to his journey, his father found him on his knees,
which accident produced the following ſhort lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>My lord having pretty well ſhamed him, ſaid— 
<q rend="inline">'Charles, I am glad to ſee this grace in you;
I never before ſpoke to you with the harſhneſs of a father; hitherto you

ſorry for what has happened, becauſe it gives me an opportunity of
ſpeaking on a ſubject which I <pb n="212" facs="tcp:1185300301:247"/> could not otherwiſe
ſo well have introduced.—You have heard of my exceſſes in my youth;
they have coſt me reflections bitterer than I would wiſh my worſt enemy.
I am not hurt at ſeeing you ſuſceptible, nor do I expect, as you grow up,
to keep you entirely continent. You are informed, your opinions are decided
ones, and you have an underſtanding far beyond your years, or I ſhould not
be ſo explicit. You have conferred on me one great bleſſing, which I know
you will never deprive me of: I mean a faithful obſervance of your word upon
all occaſions. If, upon conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your heart, you can truly make me the
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe I am going to aſk of you, theſe are the laſt words you ſhall

think of no idle amours; but perhaps that is impoſſible: if it ſhould be
ſo, chuſe ſome other place than your father's houſe: let me know

this work, for though no temper was ever more tried, or mind more worked upon,

or a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable action.</p>
               <p>This in common heroes is nothing, for being made up entirely of

tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pure and undeminiſhed?—but for an elegant, handſome, fine
young fellow, unſuſpecting, inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, ſenſible, accompliſhed,

this truth is illuſtrated; for know reader, this young gentleman preſerved
his honour, nay perhaps his life, by a ſtrict adherence to one ruling
principle, which, being ſo young, it is ſingularly admirable he ſhould
ſet down for himſelf. It was this: never to promiſe what was improper to

young clergyman, to whom he was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron. Read it ye great, and confeſs your
inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficance. Your dependants have their hangers on; your very toad-eaters
have their tools: nay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, you are their tools yourſelves. Has not
your ſteward his carriage, his country houſe, his hounds, his partridge
mews, and his doxey? and do not you pay for it? Nay he is, in point of
certainty, ſo much better off than you, that, were you to be ruined, and even
through his miſmanagement, he could behold the wreck from the ſhore, and
get comfortably to a retreat which your bounty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him.</p>
               <p>This young clergyman, whoſe name was Figgins, was originally a
Bridewell boy. Standfaſt took a great fancy to him one evening, as he
ſignalized himſelf on a rejoicing night. The peculiar addreſs with which
he broke the windows of ſuch as would not put out lights, and threw ſquibs
into coaches to frighten ladies, and burn their cloaths, evinced 
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1185300301:251"/> ſuch a proneneſs to miſchief, that Standfaſt
felt a congenial warmth, and immediately determined to ſelect this youth as a
fit inſtrument, in time, for nobler daring.</p>
               <p>It was neceſſary, however, that he ſhould add to this
unluckineſs and audacity a neceſſary portion of ſubtilty. He therefore
aſked him ſeveral queſtions, to which he received ſuch anſwers as
pleaſed him; that is to ſay, full of impudence and ambiguity: and hearing
him afterwards tell one of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that he had queered Raven Grey, his
mind was ſo made up that he determined—to uſe his own
phraſe—upon patronizing him.</p>
               <p>The reader however muſt not imagine that Mr. Standfaſt laid
himſelf open to his dependant; the matter was apparently brought about
through the medium of a third perſon, indeed Mr. Viney, to whom this hopeful
youth was a diſtant relation, and he was required, among other things, to
conſider Mr. Standfaſt as an exemplary character.</p>
               <p>The tutor prevailed upon a biſhop, a friend of his—I
ſincerely hope the biſhop did not know what he was about—to ordain
this ſpark; and this was the very friend he left in the care of Little
Hockley.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:1185300301:252"/> At the time Charles and his tutor paid
this viſit to Mr. Figgins, he was in the poſſeſſion of a vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
near Poole, which living Standfaſt procured him from a noble earl, in ſome
reſpects however owing to the young parſon's own conduct, for he was ſo
civil to introduce to his lordſhip a near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which circumſtance
ended in my lord's making up, for a large ſum of money, a ſuit which the
young lady commenced againſt him for ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though the earl was about
her thirteenth lover. One of this number, by her advice, quitted the kingdom
leſt he ſhould be taken up for the forgery of a bank note, which, after he
was gone, ſhe changed, and put the money in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Standfaſt's buſineſs with Mr. Figgins was of a very
particular nature, and perhaps the reader may ſometime hence join with me in
that opinion.—Whatever it was, Standfaſt did not chuſe to tranſact
it by letter, it being one of his maxims never to write any thing but what all
the world might read, nor make either promiſes or declarations in the
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a third perſon.</p>
               <p>In conformity to this latter part of his maxim, he very
frequently took his friend Figgins with him either a walk or a ride, begging
Charles to take care of the ladies till their return. Theſe ladies 
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1185300301:253"/> were, firſt Mr. Figgins's maiden aunt, a woman of
exemplary character, an enthuſiaſtic admirer of Drelincourt and a dram
glaſs, and who her nephew very humanely maintained, upon her paying him down
quarterly the ſum of eight pounds. Secondly Mrs. Figgins the ninth—for,
like Major O'Flaherty, he had them in all quarters, and all alive and
merry;—and, laſtly, Miſs Figgins, a young lady of beauty and
accompliſhments, but who had not yet got a huſband—though ſhe owned
twenty-ſeven—becauſe the men were brutes, and her nature was ſo
delicate that the leaſt ill treatment would break her heart.</p>
               <p>Charles found it no diſagreeable taſk to entertain theſe
ladies, in the abſence of his tutor; nay he made a traffic of his
complaiſance, for he wrote an impromtu for a ſmile, and ſketched their
portrait for a kiſs. His ſkill in muſic enchanted them, and they wiſhed
never to part with the young lord, as he was called.</p>
               <p>As to Miſs Figgins, had any one witneſſed her behaviour at
thoſe unguarded moments when he ſung a pathetic air—though, by the
bye, he was of that age when the voice ſounds more like that of a raven than
a nightingale—he would have ſworn ſhe had at once conquered her
averſion to love and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony. <pb n="219" facs="tcp:1185300301:254"/> To ſay truth, her
virtue was of the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant kind, which perhaps was one reaſon ſhe
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually talked of the great pains ſhe took to ſubdue it. Indeed ſhe
ſo prompted Charles in that part, which, if it had been the time to act, he
knew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cue, that the young gentleman had a kind of rebellion to quell,
which gave him no little diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance. In ſhort, in ſpight of his teeth
he was obliged to take a review of the promiſe he had made his father, and
reflecting that the ſiſter of Mr. Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins muſt certainly be a woman of
honour, he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly carried the point, and congratulated himſelf on this
victory over his paſſions. Indeed the term ſiſter was not included in
the conditions, but it was certainly implied, and it would have been
diſhonourable had he taken advantage of the omiſſion.</p>
               <p>The lady however having made good her land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, determined to
loſe no opportunity of improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that advantage; therefore, one day, while
they ſat at dinner, ſhe ſlily ſlipt a note into the young gentleman's
coat pocket, which contained theſe words both in form and ſubſtance.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'For hevven ſake mete mee in the arburr, and
lett mee, ho lett mee, unbuzzum myſelf.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:1185300301:255"/> Charles was too gallant not to attend the
lady.—Indeed it was very much his wiſh to have a little converſation
with her alone; not doubting but when the purity of his intentions were
honeſtly made known, the young lady's quiet would be reſtored, which at
preſent he made no doubt he greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed. Having therefore attended
the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he declared to her with the trueſt and moſt honeſt
ſimplicity, his repugnance to do that which he could not conſider
otherwiſe than as a ſhameful breach of hoſpitality. The lady acknowledged
the generoſity of his ſentiments, and ſaid, that as ſhe ſaw her fears
were unneceſſary, they might now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge in all thoſe little innocent
freedoms which to ſuſceptible and delicate hearts gave ſuch
delight.—In ſhort, after much ſimpering, ſtammering, bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and other indications of maiden baſhfulneſs—the largeſt part of
which, eſpecially the bluſhing, was moſt manifeſt in
Charles—ſhe informed him that, upon certain conditions, he ſhould
ſteal to her bedchamber, and ſleep with her that very night. Theſe
conditions were explained to be exactly what I am informed they practiſe very
commonly, and very innocently in America, under the name of bundling.</p>
               <p>Perhaps Miſs Figgins had heard of Adhelm, who, to try his
virtue, ſlept ſeveral nights with a <pb n="221" facs="tcp:1185300301:256"/> virgin without
violating his chaſtity, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Charles was intended for a great
man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined it ſhould not be her fault if he had not this proof of his
virtue in as great perfection as his pious predeceſſor. If however theſe
were her intentions, there was ſome how or other an infraction in the treaty,
for Charles and the lady ſo bundled that, at the end of a fortnight, ſhe
informed him, in the moſt decent manner ſo delicate a creature could
muſter up words for the purpoſe, that ſhe was certainly with child.</p>
               <p>What a ſtroke for our hero! Muſt he begin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to feel
the bitter reflections of having broken his promiſe. How to act? Which way to
conceal her ſhame? He could not marry her—which at ſome intervals he
had thoughts of—without conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his father, and the conſequence
of ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation was apparent. Yet he had ruined her, and brought
her into a ſituation that marriage alone could atone for. In ſo doing he
had already broken his promiſe, and why not go farther, ſince there was no
honourable means of retreat.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate, chequered with pleaſure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction, had
he paſſed ſeveral days, when Mr. Standfaſt one morning told our hero
that ſome damned thing or other had come to his fatheris ears, 
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1185300301:257"/> who required their immediate preſence in town.— 
<q rend="inline">'See there,'</q> ſaid he, ſhewing him a
letter he had that inſtant received.

               <p>Charles not doubting but his amour and its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences had
already reached his father's ears, without conſidering how the intelligence
could have been conveyed, told his tutor ingenuouſly that he was the cauſe
of it. Mr. Standfaſt ſeemed greatly aſtoniſhed at the declaration, and
demanded how it could poſſibly be? The pupil exacting a ſolemn promiſe
from his tutor that he would carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the moſt profound
ſecreſy, let him into the bundling ſecret from firſt to laſt, and
concluded with vehemently entreating his advice.</p>
               <p>Standfaſt looking very ſagacious, ſaid this muſt be the
cauſe of Lord Hazard's injunction ſure enough, which it was a very proper
thing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with, for fear of irritating him farther. As for the reſt,
he ſaid it was a curſed unlucky affair, but <pb n="223" facs="tcp:1185300301:258"/>
fortunately the brother was under his thumb, and his beſt endeavours might be
depended on to huſh matters up.</p>
               <p>If his father ſhould mention it, he adviſed Charles to deny
the whole buſineſs; though he had no doubt but he ſhould uſe ſuch
arguments as would induce him not to ſay a word about it.</p>
               <p>Charles was in raptures at the kindneſs of his tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who
took care nevertheleſs to give the young gentleman a wholeſome lecture,
declaring his great repugnance to this duplicity of conduct, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting
he only conſented to it from the laudable view of preventing a difference
between father and ſon.</p>
               <p>By this time the chaiſe was at the door; for Standfaſt,
zealous to obey his patron's mandate, had ordered it previous to this
converſation with his pupil. The latter therefore took a haſty, but ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
leave of his enamorata, who exacted a promiſe that he would write to her,
and, if poſſible, ſee her ſoon again.</p>
               <p>On the road, Standfaſt encouraged Charles to keep up his
ſpirits. He told him, for one thing, that his honour was in no ſcrape; for
that the lady, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <pb n="224" facs="tcp:1185300301:259"/> ſhe might have impoſed upon
his inexperience, was not a veſtal, nor had been for a good twenty years.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why ſhe is but ſix and twenty,' ſaid
Charles:</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'and eleven added to it,' replied the tutor. 'As
to the brat, if there ſhould be one, we muſt ſee what's to be done with
it. I have told you all theſe matters,' added he, 'leſt you ſhould be
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly drawn in, therefore you muſt promiſe me to be upon your guard.
No indiſcreet marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, nor any other ſteps without firſt conſulting
me. Upon theſe and no other terms will I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this
buſineſs.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Charles eagerly promiſed every thing his tutor demanded of
him, and Standfaſt reiterated his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſions. They both
arrived in town however with no little anxiety on their minds. That of Charles
proceeded, as the reader knows, from his fear of having made his father
miſerable. Mr. Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt had too hearty a contempt for every human
weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to feel the influence of any ſuch hen-hearted ſenſation.
Glorious miſchief begat his perplexity, and all his uneaſineſs was leſt
the banquet preparing for his inexorable ſenſes ſhould not be
ſeaſoned high enough with domeſtic wretchedneſs.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IT was agreed, upon the arrival of Charles and his tutor, that
the latter ſhould go firſt to ſee how the land lay, and that the young
gentleman ſhould not ſee his father—thereby to give their project
breath—till he had paid his reſpects to Lady Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Standfaſt immediately ſought my lord, and having very
opportunely found him, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, with but little previous ceremony,
that his patron was undone—loſt—irretrievable loſt, beyond all

               <p>

                  <q rend="inline">'Of my life, of my ſoul, of my honour!'
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned my lord. 'Oh that I had liſtened to thy advice. Heavenly God! that

Standfaſt.—'Ah my dear lord, why did I go this curſt journey into the

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Standfaſt now uttered a moſt warm and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic
ſpeech, lamenting general depravity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring moſt affectingly his
friend's want of reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So excellent indeed were his reaſons, his
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks ſo heartfelt, and his manner ſo perſuaſive, that my lord
declared there lived not his equal.—To ſay truth, this ſpeech had its
merit, and ſo it ought, for like many other ſpeeches which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to
ſurpriſe inſtead of convince, it had been ſome time in preparation. And
now the tutor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to know the particulars of this unfortunate
buſineſs, deſirous perhaps of being ſatisfied whether his actors had
performed their parts in the manner he had ſet down for them, eſpecially as
he had ſuch an opportunity of hearing their reſpective merits from a critic
who would be ſure to do them juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:1185300301:263"/> My lord briefly told him that being
informed by Colonel Tiltly and ſome others that a gentleman named Snaffle was
traducing him in every coffee-houſe where he came, and that one of his
friends who vindicated him had very nearly got into a duel on his account, he
made it his buſineſs to ſeek after Snaffle, but found only the ſham
ſiſter as before who it was plain was inſtructed to play upon him'. At
length he found his man at home, when matters were very handſomely explained,
and he was idiot enough to ſtay to ſupper. The preſence of the
ſiſter, and the bumpers with which he was drenched pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the reſt. 
<q rend="inline">'But,' concluded my lord, 'that a ſet of
people ſhould conſpire the ruin of a man ſo little known to them, and
work the deſtruction of his peace of mind, is a ſpecies of wickedneſs and
depravity that I cannot give either motive or name.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'My dear lord,' cried Standfaſt impatiently, I

                  <q rend="inline">'What do you mean?' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Lord Hazard.</q>

my lord, 'you have certainly divined the truth; it is that diabolical wretch

                  <q rend="inline">'Not at all my lord,' anſwered his kind friend

                  <q rend="inline">Well, well, hope for the beſt,' cried
Standfaſt. 'You forget my lord how artfully the ſnare was laid for you. I
am ſure if your lordſhip was off your guard, there is no prudence but may
be ſurpriſed. My advice is this: If, for the ſake of your lady's health,
matters ſhould require an explanation, honeſtly give it her, and lay the
blame upon Mrs. O'Shockneſy; I would ſtake my life upon the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. And
now my lord throw off your chagrin; I dare ſay your lady knows no

you miſerable.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'She ſhall ſee me ſo no longer then,'
ſaid my lord. 'By imitating thee I will grow honeſt, and that ſhall teach

               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:1185300301:265"/> Having ſo far adjuſted matters, Lord
Hazard felt himſelf wonderfully relieved. As for Charles, all he could learn
from his mother was, that her lord had, for ſeveral days, appeared very ill
and very uneaſy; that it certainly was cauſed by ſome diſagreeable news
he had heard; 
<q rend="inline">'but,' continued ſhe, 'whatever it is, we
muſt unite to comfort him. I am ſure from me he deſerves every thing, for
his affection encreaſes every day.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Charles, convinced he was the cauſe of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
unhappineſs, took leave of his mother as early as he decently could, to go in
queſt of Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, that common friend in the family: for ſurely it is
the office of a friend to make people eaſy.</p>
               <p>The tutor was ready to receive him, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently anxious to
put him out of pain, for he ſeized him very cordially by the hand, and told
him mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were in ſuch a ſwimming train, that he had only to appear as
if nothing had happened, and he might be aſſured that his father would not
even mention the circumſtance.</p>
               <p>Standfaſt had now reſtored the tranquility of both father
and ſon, and in ſome meaſure his own; for the latter part of his
converſation with his patron was concerning Lady Roebuck, but as he could not

he fairly concluded ſhe was afraid to attack him, or elſe perhaps, as
chance had thrown him again in her way, the lady had wiſely adopted the
proverb better late than never; and ſo promiſed herſelf the
accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of what his vanity induced him to believe ſhe wiſhed:
ſo difficult is it for men of Mr. Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt's turn of mind to credit that
any one can be actuated by motives purely generous, and merely
diſintereſted.</p>
               <p>The triumphant Mr. Standfaſt however had never been ſo near
detection as while he was abſent. That converſation between the two ladies
which took a different turn, as the reader has ſeen, at the end of the
ſeventh chapter, had introduced into the mind of Lady Roebuck a number of
alarming fears for her friend. She could not give Mr. Standfaſt that implicit
credit which he ſeemed to exact of Lord and Lady Hazard, for the active part
he had taken in the buſineſs of Miſs Snaffle. Indeed, knowing from her
own experience how little pretenſions he had either to gratitude, principle,
or generoſity, her tongue was very reluctantly reined in whenever ſhe heard
any thing in his commendation; but at length, conſidering Lady Hazard was a
new, though a very intimate acquaintance, and that the office ſhe longed to
undertake was rather a thankleſs one, ſhe took a <pb n="232" facs="tcp:1185300301:267"/>
little time for reflection, during which interval a circumſtance happened
which decided her wavering reſolution. As however it was of ſufficient
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to require that Sir Sidney ſhould be conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the reader
is of courſe anxious to know what it was, and the reſult of their
deliberations. The latter I am very ready to ſay was, that to arm Lord and
Lady Hazard againſt the machinations of Mr. Standfaſt was treading on very
tender ground, and therefore they ought not to take any material ſteps in
ſo weighty a buſineſs till their arrival in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where Sir
Sidney ſaid he would begin this Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culean labour. This then they reſolved.
As to the circumſtance which procured this reſolution, it will come better
hereafter. To have mentioned it here would have been premature, and not to have
ſaid ſomething on the ſuſpicions of Sir Sidney and his lady, would have
been tacitly to have accuſed the reader of a deficiency in penetration, for
it is hardly poſſible that any one who knew Mr. Standfaſt ſhould
believe him capable of devoting himſelf ſo ſuddenly to the practiſe of
real virtue, when his whole life had been an artful ſtudy how to keep up the
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of it.</p>
               <p>Standfaſt has been ſeen very ſolicitous to get at the
particulars of Lord Hazard's unfortunate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, for which I have
aſſigned the real motive; <pb n="233" facs="tcp:1185300301:268"/> and, to ſay truth, he
was not pleaſed with the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for in his abſence—to carry on
the alluſion I uſed at that time—his peice had been mutilated by the
managers, and ill performed by the actors; a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial incident had been cut
out of his projecting, and another, by no means conduſive to the
cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe he wiſhed to take place, introduced.—Theſe
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations were principally owing to the heroine, who in real life, as well
as upon the ſtage, is generally apt to take theſe ſort of liberties; and
though Mr. Standfaſt had not been preſent at the repreſentation of his
performance, yet, being a conſummate judge of effect, he ſaw plainly it
would have had more ſtriking ſucceſs could he have been on the ſpot to
have conducted it.</p>
               <p>To drop this alluſion, Standfaſt plainly ſaw that Mrs.
O'Shockneſy had taken the liberty to alter his plan, no doubt for private
ends of her own. He had left orders for an anonymous letter to be ſent to
Lady Hazard on the very evening his lordſhip ſhould be engaged at
Snaffle's, apprizing her of the fact. This, it was plain to Standfaſt, had
been neglected; but that ſomething, as we before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſhould be
ſubſtituted in its place, the lady had, through the means of Miſs
Snaffle, conferred a favour on his lordſhip which ſhe thought would ſerve
juſt as well to communicate the ſecret to Lady <pb n="234" facs="tcp:1185300301:269"/>
Hazard. To ſay truth, this was a <hi>coup de grace</hi> which Standfaſt,
with all his raſcallity, had not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated. It was a vengeance truly
feminine, and greatly worthy the vindictive Mrs. O'Shockneſy.—How
theſe conſpirators anſwered their conduct to their ringleader will by and
by be ſeen. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I ſhall only ſay that Mrs. O'Shockneſy
defended herſelf by an argument which will at leaſt prove her to be a
proper coadjutor of the great Mr. Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt. It was no leſs than that the
knowledge of Lady Hazard's pregnancy induced her to take that harmleſs ſtep
before mentioned, without her prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal's privity; at which he was as much
incenced as was Hecate againſt the witches, who dared to prompt Macbeth in
his iniquity without her orders.</p>

                  <p>PERMANENT HAPPINESS APPEARS TO BE RESTORED, AND THE WHOLE
SOCIETY SET OUT ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THE COUNTRY.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT will now be proper to ſpeak concerning Miſs Le Clerc,
whoſe whole hiſtory, as far as Mr. Ingot knew it, Sir Sidney learnt much
about the time the two ladies were reading Emma's letter; for the good citizen
being, as I obſerved, Lord Hazard's man of buſineſs, they were in a
manner obliged to conſult him upon ſeveral points relative to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of Little Hockley. On the firſt of theſe viſits every thing naturally
came out, and when the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet and his lady met, both were ripe for the
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of what was no ſecret to either.</p>
               <p>The ſtory of Annette was no myſtery, but it has been ſhewn
in what way it was told; and if Miſs Le Clerc was Sir Sidney's wife, what
then was Lady Roebuck? This was a conſideration of a moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
nature, and, in juſtice to ſo amiable a lady, it was admitted that it ought
to be ſet to rights.—Lord and Lady Hazard being therefore the only
perſons who had it in their power to make a ſingle <pb n="236" facs="tcp:1185300301:271"/>
comment on this ſubject, and that nobleman and his lady having by this time,
for many reaſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come great favourites with theſe two friends, they
were, without the alteration of a ſingle circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, informed of the
real truth. This led to the eſtabliſhment of a moſt intimate and binding
friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between the two couples, and the baronet and Lady Roebuck
felicitated themſelves upon the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, as they now conceived it, of that
plan which they had formed of making Lord Hazard the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former of his own
village. As preaching however cannot have half the effect of example, they
reſolved, as the reader has ſeen, to reſerve their grand attack till they
ſhould arrive at the place of action, when his lordſhip ſhould be
aſſailed in ſuch a manner as would deprive him of the means of defending
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and oblige him—eſpecially as his lady was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gained
over—to ſurrender at diſcretion.</p>
               <p>Lord Hazard very ſoon got perfectly reſtored to health, and
as there were no reaſons to believe that his ſuſpicions concerning his
lady had any founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he by degrees regained his uſual eaſe and
tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility.</p>
               <p>As to Charles, he received a quire of letters from Miſs
Figgins, full of <hi>ſythes and wows, and flamming arts;</hi> but, convinced
that under the guidance of <pb n="237" facs="tcp:1185300301:272"/> Standfaſt, all he incurred
was a trifling expence, he rather felt proud of the buſineſs, and was not a
little pleaſed that, at an age under eighteen, he had given ſuch notable
proofs of his manhood. He felt however very gratefully towards both his
parents, who he was convinced knew of his irregularity, and had the kindneſs
not to upbraid him with it; and, as this imaginary conduct of theirs induced
him to treat them with the moſt dutiful and minute atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo it
endeared him to their notice and regard ten times ſtronger than ever. Sir
Sidney was not an idle ſpectator of this. He was charmed with Charles, and
really began to meditate ſeriouſly that alliance which it may be
recollected he mentioned formerly in jeſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe projects, which were intended to bloſſom in the
ſpring, and produce fruit in the ſummer, laid at preſent dormant in their
minds; we will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſs over the hurry of the winter, and bring them
to the ſign of the John of Gaunt's Head, an inn in their way to
Warwickſhire.</p>
               <p>The landlord of this houſe, who was a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of Sir
Sidney, prided himſelf on having as diſtinct and ample a genealogy as any
lord; nay he looked upon himſelf as ſuperior to many who boaſt that
title: for, ſaid he, 
<q rend="inline">'What are lords, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures 
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1185300301:273"/> of yeſterday, to thoſe in my family of three hundred
years ſtanding?' adding, 'alack a day! human creatures are buckets in a well,
one up, and tother down.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>This landlord was not a little proud of having been a
ſubſtantial yeoman of Kent. He had been indeed a conſiderable farmer, but
having a ſtrong inclination to indulge himſelf in that hoſpitality in
which it was not within his circumſtances to cut any tolerable figure, he had
entertained ſo many poor gentlemen of high extraction, till at length, as the
phraſe is, he ran out; and, leaving off farming, left alſo his own country,
and took an inn not far from High Wickham.</p>
               <p>The houſe bore all the inſignia of its maſter's fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
conſequence, and the reliques of thoſe mighty deeds which were performed by
his anceſtors, and in which he took ſo much pleaſure, as he ſat in his
chimney corner, to record, were diſtributed about wherever he could find a
place for them. Shields and ſpears glittered in the kitchen inſtead of
pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids and ſpits; helmets and cuiſſes, in the place of ſtag's horns,
adorned the hall, and miſmatched pieces of tapeſtry covered the walls of
every room.</p>
               <p>Lord Hazard inſiſted upon being introduced in 
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1185300301:274"/> form, and Sir Sidney undertook to be gentleman uſher
upon the occaſion. My lord confeſſed he could boaſt but of very recent
extraction, being, as one might ſay, a junior branch of the nobility. 
<q rend="inline">'Why truly' anſwered the landlord, 'you will
pardon my jocularity my lord, there is a ſpot of <hi>Ruſt</hi> on your
eſchuteon which perhaps, by <hi>Hazard,</hi> may be rubbed out.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The archneſs as well as frankneſs of this reply pleaſed
his lordſhip ſo much, that he entered into a long converſation with the
landlord, that ended in an explanation of all the warlike trophies before
mentioned, the hiſtory of which contained a kind of ſummary review of the
hiſtory of England; we ſhall therefore forbear to recite any part of what
paſſed, except one remark. They were examining a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, which was
ſaid to have belonged to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Mary, Queen of Scots. My lord
ſaid that her's was a lamentable fate. 
<q rend="inline">'Lamentable,' ſaid the landlord, ſhaking his
head, 'if ſhe had not been an angel upon earth, Beſs would not have been
ſo ready to ſend her to make one in heaven.'</q>

               <argument>
                  <p>A NIGHT SCENE, WHICH MR. FLUSH WOULD HAVE CALLED A VERY
VARIETOUS KIND OF A THING.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AT the inn where our travellers lay had arrived two muſicians,
juſt before dark, who were going to a nobleman's ſcat in the neighbourhood,
upon a ſummer excurſion, and where there was to be a grand concert the next
day. One of the gentlemen, an Italian, had the day before been ſeized with a
vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fever, but being told that his patron had ſent expreſs for him, he
determined to go in ſpight of his indiſpoſition, eſpecially as he knew
he ſhould be taken greater care of at the houſe of his benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor than at
home. His companion came to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him that he had received a ſimilar
ſummons. This put the finiſhing ſtroke to the Italian's deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
for they were both famous performers on the trumpet, and ſeldom played
aſunder.</p>
               <p>At this meeting the two muſicians talked about what fiſhing
and ſhooting they ſhould have, and, above all, what delicious burgundy they
ſhould taſte at his lordſhip's; nor did they fail to enjoy, by
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation, certain jokes which the Italian, being <pb n="241" facs="tcp:1185300301:276"/> a
wag, had it in contemplation to play ſome of his lordſhip's retinue. One in
particular he concerted, which was to ridicule a black ſervant, for whom the
Italian had an inveterate averſion, becauſe he could not blow the french
horn in tune. 
<q rend="inline">'Perdio' cried he 'I tink I ſee de villain
cavaliero vid his vite orſe and plack viſage make one tammed niſe oh
Diavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo.'</q> For it ſhould here be known that his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, though he
had conſtantly a troop of muſicians after him, and ſome of them men of
diſtinguiſhed talents, would rather have been called in at the death of a
fox, by the diſſonant belching of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite horn, than have liſtened
to the beſt chorus of HANDEL, performed by five hundred and fifty-three
perſons, capable of realizing all that celeſtial rapture of which Doctor
BURNEY dreamt.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh muſician took his leave of the Italian
recommending him to take as much reſt as poſſible before they ſhould
ſet off. In conformity with this advice, the Italian betook himſelf to
ſleep, and paſſed the night in tolerable tranquility, except that he had
a ſlight delirium, in which he fancied the above mentioned black purſued
him, on his white horſe, and that he eſcaped from him with great
difficulty; and much more ſuch ſtuff, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the effect of a
diſtempered brain. Having, however, ſhook off the phantom, he afterwards
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <pb n="242" facs="tcp:1185300301:277"/> tolerable repoſe, and felt himſelf pretty
well recovered when his friend, the Engliſh muſician, came to call him
up.</p>
               <p>I thought it neceſſary to premiſe thus much, that the
reader might the better account for a diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance that happened at the inn.
The houſe was buried in a total ſilence, when the Italian, whoſe
diſtemper had received no mitigation from either the journey or a ſhower of
rain which had fallen in the afternoon, all of a ſudden awoke from a horrid
dream, in which his inveterate enemy, the black, appeared to him on his
ſteed, as before, but with the addition of a large ſabre, with which he
threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to put him inſtantly to death.</p>
               <p>Frightened at the ſpectre, like Chamont, he roſe and called
for lights, which indeed he need not have done, for there was a ſolitary
candle glimmering in the chimney corner, by the help of which imperfect
luminary, every thing could faintly be diſcerned. Leaping from the bed, the
firſt object his eyes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered being a figure in the tapeſtry of Edward
the black prince, mounted upon a white horſe, and giving directions at the
battle of Poictiers, he ran in a moſt frantic manner along the gallery, and,
ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his corpulent form—which extremely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a brandy keg,
or a ninepin, made a rapid <pb n="243" facs="tcp:1185300301:278"/> deſcent to the hall
underneath. There, being in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal darkneſs, he groped about for a
conſiderable time, to no purpoſe, in hopes of finding a door into the
yard.</p>
               <p>All this time the fever being at an alarming height, every thing
he touched ſeemed to be the falling ſtroke of that monſtrous inſtrument
of death wielded by the figure in the tapeſtry. At length, bellowing like a
bull, and bounding from one table to another, like a toſt pancake, or a
kicked football, he diſcovered, as he imagined, the door. A faint glimmering
of light that beamed on him facilitated this welcome idea, and he ſtrove, but
in vain, to find the lock. Exploring this impervious gloom, which, as far as
his ſcattered recollection gave op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to notice, appeared the ſeat
of ſorcery, where all the demons of hell were aſſembled to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him;
for as to being in an inn, it never once occurred to his imagination,
ſomething that felt like down, and ſmelt intolerably bitter, fell about his
ears, and tormented him the more in proportion as he attempted to defend
himſelf from it. And now, having his eyes, noſe and mouth pretty well
filled with this ſuffocating annoyance, which, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the air-drawn
dagger of Macbeth, was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible only to the feeling, he ſtampt, rubbed
his face, raved, ſputtered, and ſtruggled, till at laſt he 
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1185300301:279"/> got out of the vortex of this den of Erebus, to which he
ſeemed to have been drawn by a helliſh and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible influence.</p>
               <p>Lifting however his hands in an extreme of
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction—indeed exactly as St. Paul is drawn preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at
Athens—ſomething tumbled from above which fitted himſelf completely,
like a coat of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, without the caſque or cuiſſes.</p>
               <p>Fully perſuaded the demon that purſued him had now got him
in his clutches, he ſtormed, howled, foamed, and ſqueaked out as
incongruous and inar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate a recitative as ever Hannibal or Scipio did at
the opera houſe.</p>
               <p>At this moment one of the waiters, who had been to pay a viſit
to the bed chamber of the cook maid Molly, and who of courſe was the moſt
watchful in the houſe, entered the hall with a lighted candle.</p>
               <p>The Italian's ſingular jeopardy was occaſioned by his
miſtaking the chimney for the door. There, ſtruggling to get out, he had
made himſelf as black as a ſoot bag, and, upon his retreat, fairly
inveſted himſelf in the ſtrange manner above mention, with a buff jerkin,
which my landlord had received as a legacy from his father, who affirmed and
verily <pb n="245" facs="tcp:1185300301:280"/> believed that it was the ſame worne by Guy,
Earl of Warwick, when he killed the dun cow.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had the waiter ſeen this precious relique of his
maſter's anceſtors in the hands, or rather on the back of the Italian,
than, taking him for a thief, who wanted to rob the houſe, he ran to fetch
his maſter. The Italian, to be even with him, upon deſcrying the light and
an oppoſite door at the ſame time, ran rapidly up another pair of ſtairs.
His precipitate flight confirmed the waiter in his ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, and
facilitated his return to his maſter, who, by this time, alarmed by the
noiſe, had juſt iſſued from his apartment.</p>
               <p>The landlord having heard the matter from his man, ſwore by
the glory of his forefathers he would cut him up alive, and invoking the manes
of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the black prince, and John of Gaunt, followed muttering curſes all
the way to the chamber of the Engliſh muſician, whither the Italian had by
acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent directed his flight, and to where his diſtracted bellowing piloted
both man and maſter.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Italian had reached his brother
profeſſor's apartment, and hid himſelf, buff jerkin and all, under the
cloaths. The Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, diſturbed by the noiſe, and ſtill more by the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1185300301:281"/> Italian's flouncing into bed, waked in an inſtant, and
before he had time to recollect what could oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſo extraordinary an
intruſion, ſaw in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed manner, by the help of the light which
dimly gleamed through the paſſage, what a ſtrange hedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous figure he had
in bed with him, on which he had no ſooner caſt his eyes, than, in a
dreadful fright, he all of a ſudden leaped from the bed, and got under
it.</p>
               <p>The Italian, who began to perceive the light, and concluding his
companion had ſeen the man and horſe which he had no doubt ſtill
purſued him, followed him cloſe at his heels, being under the bed almoſt
as ſoon as him. The Engliſh muſician being preſſed hard by the ſame
abominable figure, half dead with the fright, crawled out on the oppoſite
ſide, which happened to be next to the door, ſtill followed by the
Italian.</p>
               <p>The landlord and the waiter now came up with them, and the
candle being produced, the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this quadrumvirate was beyond the
power of tongue or pen to deſcribe. The diſtraction of the Italian, the
aſtoniſhment of his companion, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralytic fear of the landlord, who,
ſpight of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of his anceſtors, trembled from head to foot, and
the conſternation of the waiter, compoſed in <pb n="247" facs="tcp:1185300301:282"/> their
different countenances ſuch a ſet of unbrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, olive, livid and
cadaverous tints as ſurely no faces ever before exhibited.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh trumpeter, as he encountered the landlord, was
overturned, and now lay flat on the floor. The deſcendant of Hengiſt had
gathered himſelf up into a groteſque attitude, looking at the fallen
muſician, and the waiter was puſhing the candle forward, under his
maſter's arm, to ſee what was the matter, while the Italian had crept to
the other ſide of the bed, and having ſearched for ſomething to defend
himſelf, catched up his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion's trumpet, who had brought that
inſtrument into his chamber, to have it ſafe. With this wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon he leapt
upon a cheſt of drawers, and whether he was now wrought to ſuch a height of
phrenzy as not to know what he did, or whether inſtinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the
trumpet to his mouth without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, certain it is that his ſtretched
companion had ſcarcely demanded what was the matter, and the landlord
thundered out a volley of execrations, ending with 
<q rend="inline">'give me my jerkin,'</q> than the Italian
ſounded a charge, and then a defiance, and then a parley, as faſt as they
could ſucceed each other.</p>
               <p>The moment the Engliſh muſician heard the trumpet, he knew
his friend as well as if he had <pb n="248" facs="tcp:1185300301:283"/> ſpoken to him, and
inſtantly gueſſed that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion muſt have been occaſioned by
the Italian's ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who had become delirious, and thus alarmed the
houſe.</p>
               <p>Feeling, however, for the ſafety of his trumpet, which ſame
provident ſenſation impelled the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord in relation to the Earl of
Warwick's habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they both approached him, where he ſtood, trumpet in
hand, like another fame in a buff jerkin, and were within an inch of their
prey, when the Italian fairly made a ſpring over their heads, darted out of
the door, and ran along the gallery, then down ſtairs, afterwards out of the
back door into the yard, and laſtly all over the village, blowing away
almoſt without any ceſſation.</p>
               <p>This was a partial laſt trump to the village, for all but
thoſe in their graves immediately ſtarted up to ſee what was the matter.
As to the inn, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation never formed ſo ſingular a confuſion. The
muſician raved for his trumpet, the landlord ſtormed for his buff jerkin;
here a waiter appeared with his cloaths tumbled into the tail of his ſhirt,
which he held by way of an apron; there a maid ſervant with a petticoat tied
about her head inſtead of her waiſt; here John the oſtler appeared in
Sukey's night cap, and Sukey in John's wig:—In ſhort there was not

the hall together—even to Sir Sidney and Lord Hazard, that did not cut a
ludicrous figure, while the village cried out ſome a fight, others a fire,
and all with haſty ſteps ran towards our inn, which thus, in a few minutes,
was filled, in addition to its own company, with the major part of the village,
among whom were not a few females with clouts about their heads, and children
in their arms, a ſort of ſpectators who are ſure to be foremoſt at
every ſight, be it a boxing match, a lord mayor's ſhew, or an
execution.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh muſician, getting upon the great table, now
begged to be heard; and having at laſt obtained ſilence, very naturally
accounted for every thing that had happened, finiſhing with a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he apprehended the Italian muſt now be ſo far gone, that the
landlord's jerkin and his trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet were certainly in danger of being
ſpoiled.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Far gone!' cried a country fellow, 'why I zeed
un myzel at the back of Maſter Clover's barn, and that's only behind thick
here orchard. Oons, do but liſt a tiny bit; doſt not hear un?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I do,' exclaimed the muſician, 'I do, and my
dear trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet is as ſound as ever! Zounds, I know what I will do: ſhew me
to his bed chamber:'</q>—at <pb n="250" facs="tcp:1185300301:285" rendition="simple:additions"/> which he jumped
down, and ſo ſcampered up ſtairs, that the ſpectators began to fear
leſt he ſhould be infected with the ſame phrenzy as his companion. A very
few ſeconds however brought him back again, with the Italian's own trumpet,
hollowing out, 
<q rend="inline">'This will do, this will do; here is that
ſhall bring him back again.'</q> He now haſtened to the yard door, and,
putting the trumpet to his mouth, ſounded a defiance, which was immediately
anſwered at a diſtance. In his next eſſay he was anſwered ſomewhat
nearer. Upon two or three repetitions the Italian came down the ſtreet,
ſounding all the way a parley, till at laſt he was caught, held faſt,
brought into the houſe, and the trumpet and buff jerkin reſtored to their
reſpective owners. As to the poor devil himſelf, he was an object of the
trueſt compaſſion. His eyes darted fire, he foamed at the mouth, and
raved like a bedlamite.</p>
               <p>At the deſire of his friend, the Italian was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to his
bed, which, in a moſt emaciated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he made ſhift to leave in
ſomewhat leſs than five weeks.</p>
