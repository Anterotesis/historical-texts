            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE ADDRESS.</head>
            <p>THIS TREATISE on PRACTICAL SEAMANSHIP, with hints and remarks relating thereto, as mentioned in the contents, is humbly addreſſed to all whom the different parts moſtly concern; but more eſpecially to young Sea Officers, who uſe their utmoſt endeavours, under Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to make the knowledge and diſcharge of their duty in their ſtations, the principal pleaſure and purſuit of their time, which may make them a benefit and not a burden to their country, their friends, and themſelves, in their voyage through life.</p>
            <p>IT muſt be allowed, that the improvement of our ſhips, and the management of them, for many years paſt, has given that remarkable ſuperiority <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſeamen have over others, on all important occaſions. Yet I have learned from experience, that this art of ſeamanſhip, and its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, is not ſo generally underſtood amongſt us as it deſerves, for one trading part of the nation has, by their practice, the experience the other wants.</p>
            <p>SOME men are ſo devoted to the methods they have been accuſtomed to, that they cannot be prevailed upon to try another; others endeavour to try impracticable methods, and attempt to make ſhips do impoſſibilities, ſuch as to
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1112800100:4"/>
back them aſtern clear of a ſingle anchor, when the wind is right againſt the windward tide, that drives them to windward of their anchors; or to back a ſhip with ſails ſo ſet as to prevent her from ſhooting a-head towards a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger when laid to, or driving broad ſide with the wind right againſt the tide, not knowing that a ſhip driving on either tack will always ſhoot and advance bodily forward, the way her head lies, in ſpite of any ſails that can be ſet aback; all which, I truſt, will be ſhewn in their proper places in the following work.</p>
            <p>NOT only the above inſtances, (by which I have known ſhips go on ſhore,) but the whole duty and conduct of ſea officers, as far as mentioned in this book, has hitherto been left entirely to the ſlow progreſs of experience, by which they, and all concerned with them, are conſtantly liable to be great ſufferers by miſtaken practices in ſeaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</p>
            <p>FREQUENT obſervations of this defect, induced me to endeavour to fix the beſt rules for Practical Seamanſhip, that ſeamen may not be left entirely to learn their duty by their own and other people's misfortunes, which has been the caſe hitherto, but by the experience of others who have gone before them. From all that I have ſeen, in the many different trades that I have been employed in, thoſe ſeamen in the coal and coaſting trade, to the city of <hi>London,</hi> are the moſt perfect in working and managing their ſhips in narrow, intricate, and difficult channels, and in tide ways; and the ſeamen in the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> trade are ſo on the open ſeas.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:1112800100:5"/>I HAVE heard it was ſaid by the great Doctor <hi>Halley,</hi> that the ſafety of navigating ſhips, in his time, depended principally upon three L's, meaning lead, latitude, and lookout. But a late Mathematician, a friend of mine at <hi>Liverpool,</hi> ſaid, that there was no hidden or unknown principles concerned in the art of building, ſailing, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and managing of ſhips, but the laws of motion, the preſſure of fluids, and the properties of the leaver, which are all well known to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Philoſophers and Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians, and nothing ſo much deſerved their attention and purſuit, to bring this art to its utmoſt perfection for the welfare and ſupport of GREAT BRITAIN.</p>
            <p>THESE reaſons, and that of the moſt of the uſeful arts having been made public, to our great improvement and advantage, emboldens me to publiſh this laboured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance on this long neglected ſubject, which, I muſt own, will appear to great diſadvantage from the unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted difficulties I have found, in being a new writer ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing to lead the way on ſo important and extenſive a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in this learned criticiſing age; but for my imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as a ſcholar, I hope the Critics will make allowance for my having been early in life at ſea as cook of a collier; and having ſince then gone through all the moſt active en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing employments I could meet with, as a ſeaman, who has done his beſt, and who, as an author, would be glad of any remarks candidly pointed out how to improve his defects, if there ſhould be a demand for a SECOND EDITION.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the elements principally concerned in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſhips, are air or wind, and water, I hope I ſhall be excuſed in taking the liberty to endeavour to explain what I have learned from others, or know myſelf from experience, of the properties of theſe fluids, ſo far as they may concern practical ſeamanſhip.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>On AIR.</head>
               <p>IT is enough for our purpoſe here to ſay, that air in motion which moves ſhips, is a fluid body, as much as the water they ſwim in: This is proved from many experiments, and may be perceived from what we ſee ordained by the ALL GREAT AUTHOR of nature, in birds, inſects, and all animals that fly, how they float or ſwim, ſteer and govern their directions through the air by their wings and tails, upon the ſame principles that fiſh ſwim in water.</p>
               <p>AND air is proved by experiment to have its weight in air of about ſeventeen grains to a quart, near the ſurface of the ſea,<note place="margin">The weight of air.</note> as a quart veſſel when the air is pumped out by an air pump, weighs about ſeventeen grains leſs than when the air is in it; but the air weighs leſs and leſs in proportion, as it is higher above the ſurface or level of the ſea: And its property is to buoy up or raiſe any matter that is lighter than it ſelf, bulk for bulk, as may be ſeen by ſmoak, ſteam,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1112800100:15"/>
or vapours, riſing up to certain heights, 'till they come to air that is of the ſame weight with themſelves, where they float and make miſts, fogs, or clouds, which darken the ſky, and hinders us from ſeeing any conſiderable diſtance about us, till they are diſperſed or ſeparated, or fall in rain or ſnow, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>CONFINED air in ſhips deſerves particular notice, it often occaſions diſeaſes,<note place="margin">Foul air in ſhips.</note> and ſometimes immediate death, as has frequently been the caſe in the pump wells of ſhips of war; charcoal fires, &amp;c. in cloſe places, are dangerous and ſometimes fatal; too many people together in cloſe places, filth and dirt made and ſuffered to continue below, fouls the air, therefore every ſeaman that does not know it ſhould be told, that by his common breathing he fouls a gallon of air, and requires a gallon of freſh air to breath in every minute; ſo that for the preſervation of themſelves, they ſhould not grudge or think much to keep the places where they reſt, as clear and clean as things will admit of; and uſe every method poſſible to keep ſhips clear of bad air, which becomes proportionably heavier as it becomes more foul, and looſing its circulating property it naturally deſcends to, and ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in the loweſt vacancies, where it haſtens to corruption every thing that is ſubject to decay, even the ſhip and her materials; and much more ſo the proviſions, which muſt conſequently make unhealthy ſhips.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">To get clear of foul air.</note>WHEN foul air in ſhips proceeds from their being over crowded with people below, which may prove very fatal: to prevent the bad effects of its lying in a ſhip, I would recommend to keep the pumps conſtantly working tho' no water in the ſhip 'till a lighted candle will burn clear in the bottom of the pump well, where the worſt air lodges, as being the loweſt and greateſt vacancy in ſhip's holds; and all water pumps, will act the part of air pumps, or ventilators, as it is known that the water would not riſe to the ſucking pumps, if the air was not firſt pumped out of them. And as <hi>Guinea</hi> ſhips, whilſt the ſlaves are on board, have their large cloſe fire furnace ſtanding nearly over their pump well; how eaſy might a ſhort cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per pipe, of about four-inch bore, be made to go into an iron nozel in the ſide of the furnace, and the other end on to a lead or wooden pipe of near the ſame bore, that might be carried down into the pump well by various ways; and as they make their fires for cooking juſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter midnight, which is the time when all the ſlaves are below, and then ventilators are moſt wanted, it is known from experience in ſhips of war, were ſuch pipes are uſed, that whilſt the fire burne, by its rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, it will draw up and expel a conſtant flow of air from the pump
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1112800100:16"/>
well; ſo that by theſe means, the loweſt and fouleſt air may be got out of ſhips, and the freſh air will naturally circulate and take its place.<note place="margin">The preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of air.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THE power of the airs preſſure on all bodies near the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the ſea, is computed to be about fifteen pounds weight on every ſquare inch; it preſſes every way in all directions, not only downwards, but ſlanting, ſideways, and upwards, as may be ſeen in common without machines for that purpoſe, by thoſe little round leather ſuckers (as they are called) uſed by boys at play, which when wet, and clapped upon ſmooth ſtones, preſs the air from between the ſtone and the ſucker, then hawling upon the ſtring, in the middle it makes a ſmall vacuum or little hollow ſpace void of air, and the airs preſſure upwards oppoſite to the vacuum, is what the ſtones are lifted and carried by about the ſtreets.</p>
               <p>THE preſſure of the air downwards is known and experienced in many caſes,<note place="margin">The bad effects the air's preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure may have on ſhips, &amp;c. which ground in mud.</note> and its bad effects are felt upon ſhips ſometimes when they take out a raft port, which they think high enough out of the water when the ſhip is afloat; but if ſhe after that grounds, by the tide leaving her upon mud, ſo as to preſs the water from under part of the bottom, the airs preſſure downwards againſt that part in the mud, where there is neither air nor water, will confine the ſhip from riſing out of the mud 'till the water flows much above her floating mark, and the water may run in at the raft-port and ſink her. And in ſmall veſſels which are deep loaded, and lie a-ground upon mud, and eſpecially if their bottoms are flat, ſuch as a great number of veſſels are which carry goods up and down rivers, when deep loaden the maſters dread and avoid, as much as they can, laying them in the mud, on account of its ſuction, as it's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called, and thought to be, but is entirely owing to the airs preſſure downwards, acting upon the parts where the air and water are preſſed from under them, that their veſſels are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, of ſinking before they can riſe or float out of the mud, and which ſometimes pulls pieces of ſheathing off ſhips bottoms, from the ſame cauſe, when the water gets between the bottom and the ſheathing, and none between that and the mud. The ſame cauſe will alſo keep wood, or any other thing that will ſwim, and is lighter than water, from riſing; for if their buoyancy don't lift them before the water flows upon them, the weight and preſſure of the water is then added to the airs preſſure downwards to prevent their riſing.</p>

higher in the tube; and when it comes to twenty-nine inches and a half, the air is then reckoned at the medium or middle ſtate, and there the weather is mark'd changeable; but when the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury comes to be forced above thirty inches; from that to thirty-one inches, is mark'd fair, dry, froſt, ſerene weather, &amp;c. as ſuch may be expected, when the air is denſe or in its heavy ſtate; it then raiſes and buoys up the particles floating in it, to a greater height, where they may be ſeparated ſo as to make the ſky clear of clouds for a time.

               <p>BUT, (as a ſailor) I venture to ſay,<note place="margin">Of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> that the weather often proves very different from what is pointed out by our weather-glaſſes, or by any other of thoſe improv'd inſtruments or rules that have been made by later, and more accurate obſervers of the air and weather that I have yet ſeen, and I doubt their being of any great ſervice to ſea-faring people; for I have ſeen ſtrong gails with a high glaſs, not only Eaſterly, (which commonly raiſes the mercury) but when up at thirty inches, I have known it blow ſtrong Weſterly, with rain and ſnow; I have likewiſe ſeen moderate and fair weather, with the mercury as low as twenty-eight inches three tenths. I have been in the open ocean along way from any land, in moderate and fair weather, ſailing pleaſantly along, when ſuddenly the ſhip has been ſtruck with a ſingle flaſh of lightning: This inflamable matter in the air, like electrical matter, ſeemed to take fire at the touch of the ſhip's maſts.</p>
               <p>BUT in juſtice to barometers, I muſt own I had once,<note place="margin">A ſtorm once pointed out by the weather glaſs.</note> and but once, the advantage of a true admonition of an approaching ſtorm of wind, from <hi>Tampion</hi>'s portable barometer, which I carried to ſea with me as a weather-glaſs for ſome time; and this happened at the mouth of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> channel, when about ſeventy veſſels ſailed from the <hi>Downs,</hi> with a moderate breeze in the S.

This ſudden change of weather, and of the wind to the oppoſite point of the compaſs, probably proved of bad conſequence to all who were unprepared for it. The next morning we ſaw a <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>Daniſh</hi> ſhip, floating bottom up, which we ſuppoſed was loaded with timber, and had been overſet by this unexpected ſtorm, taking her a-back with all ſails ſet, and the accounts we had afterwards, were, that moſt of this fleet ſuffered damage.</p>

               <p>WIND may be ſaid to be only the air moving over the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of our globe, from one place where it is heavier, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another place where it is lighter, which difference occaſions its different directions; and the ſwiftneſs of its motion, is in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the different denſities of the air in different places, as PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIDENCE has pleaſed to order it for many valuable purpoſes.</p>
               <p>WE call it calm, when the air is without motion; but when the air moves, we call it wind; and its power is calculated to increaſe, in proportion to the ſquare of its velocity or ſwiftneſs with which it flies, which is at the rate of about ſixty miles an hour, in one of the greateſt ſtorms in our climate, as the ingenious <hi>Smeaton</hi> has ſhewn in his table of winds, after he had found out what may be called the fix'd ſtandard for wind-mill ſails, from ingenious experiments, which I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1112800100:20"/>
have ſeen him make in a cloſe room; for the air though at reſt, or in a calm, will act upon any body that is put in motion, as ſo much wind of the ſame ſwiftneſs. Suppoſe a ſhip launching in a calm to gain a velocity, or run at the rate of a mile in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, at this time, the ſhip will feel the ſame effect from this calm, as one of our greateſt ſtorms of a mile in a minute or ſixty miles an hour, would have had upon her ſtern, when ſhe was faſt upon the ſtocks; and a ſhip launched with the ſame velocity, and in the ſame direction with this ſtorm of wind, would feel it calm, for the time the run as faſt as the wind blowed, as may be noticed, when it happens that ſhips are launched with a briſk wind, and their colours blowing aft, the ſame way they are to run, when they come to a quick motion in launching, their colours flie fored for that time. And when any body is put into ſo quick a motion through the air, as not to give the air time to cloſe behind it, in that caſe it makes in ſome degree, a vacuum, and in proportion to this vacuum, there will not only be the reſiſtance, but the preſſure of the air, acting upon theſe bodies, which may be near fifteen pounds upon every ſquare inch; and this may be the reaſon why ſhips maſts and yards, ſome times are rowl'd away in a calm, when they are put into ſo very quick motion, by a labourſome ſhip's rowling. A ſhip under way in a calm, where there is a ſtrong tide or current, will be affected as if a light air or gentle wind was right againſt and in proportion to the ſtrength of the tide or current. As the wind happens to blow with or againſt the tide or current, a ſhip will feel leſs or more wind in proportion to the rate of the tide or current.</p>
               <p>WIND in many inſtances is altered from its natural direction,<note place="margin">On eddy winds, and how the wind is altered from its natural direction</note> as in a narrow river, that has high land, or high trees cloſe to the water, on each ſide, there the wind commonly blows either right up or right down the river. When the wind blows right acroſs a river, or right off any high land, or when a ſhip is cloſe under high land, when it blows ſtrong, they often feel ſuch guſts of eddy winds in all directions, that ſhips pendants are ſometimes ſeen to be blown right up in the air; in ſuch ſituations, they can't trim their ſquare-ſails faſt enough to any advantage, therefore it is beſt to have the ſquare-ſails cloſe furl'd; and if any ſails can be of advantage, it muſt be the ſtay-ſails, mizen, boom-ſails, try-ſails, and ſuch others, as may be worked without laying ſo long aback, as to give the ſhip ſtern-way.</p>
               <p>A SHIP ſailing cloſe by the wind, one particle or part of air, drives off the other from the lee or after-leach of the ſail,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1112800100:21"/>
which turns the wind from its direction for a little time, as may be noticed, by a ſhips after-ſails being obliged to be trim'd ſharper than her head-ſails, and her enſign not flying above three points to leeward, when the ſhip is ſailing near ſix points from the wind.</p>
               <p>WHEN ſhips are ſailing quartering, or before the wind, the wind then blows perpendicular to, or right upon the ſails, which makes them bag more, or form a hollow, ſo that the wind when it blows ſtrong, may compreſs the air in the belly of the ſail, into leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs than its natural ſtate, for air contrary to all other fluids has that property, that it may be compreſſed into a very ſmall ſpace, as is known by charging and diſcharging of wind-guns, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porties, of water.</note>WATER is a fluid element, capable to float ſhips, and Philoſophers tell us, that the particles or ſingle parts of water are ſo ſmall, that their form can't be preceived by the beſt microſcopes, or greateſt magnifying glaſſes; but that they muſt be round and ſmooth, from their moving ſo freely one amongſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and from their eaſily giving way, and opening a paſſage for all bodies moving therein: And particles of water muſt be hard, and touch each other, as it is known from experience, that water can't be compreſſed or forced into leſs compaſs than its natural bulk, by any power or weight that can be employed upon it, and as action and re-action are equal and contrary to each other, it re-acts as it is acted upon.</p>
               <p>WATER will float the greateſt or heavieſt bodies that take up more room in water than it ſelf, and ſhips, boats, or veſſels, with all they contain in or about them, and all other things that will float in water, are exactly the ſame weight as the bulk of water they diſplace, by the bulk of that part of their bodies actually in the water, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their ſwiming mark, which is lower down or higher up, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the weight or denſity of the water they ſwim in; for ſhips are known to ſwim lighter in ſalt water than in freſh, in proportion as the ſalt is heavier than freſh: Therefore, ſuppoſe a pint of water to weigh a pound, (as it does or thereabouts in common) and any thing that will ſwim in water and weigh a pound, put into a veſſel full
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1112800100:22"/>
of water, will diſplace or make run over, its own bulk of water to its ſwimming mark, a pint for a pound. The ſame rule holds good to ſhips of the greateſt burden, or to other bodies according to their bulk.</p>
               <p>THE power and preſſure of water is known to increaſe according to its altitude, regardleſs of its quantity, for ſuppoſe a tight dock to be made, that would nearly fit to the ſhape of the bottom of one of our firſt rate ſhips of war to her floating mark, half an inch or the leaſt thickneſs of water would lift and float this ſhip, as effectually as the whole ocean; for water like other fluids, preſſes equally in all directions; therefore, the water muſt preſs equally againſt the ſhip, as it does againſt the dock, which muſt conſequently float the ſhip as ſoon as the water comes to the height of her floating mark: And ſuppoſe this dock could be filled with water when the ſhip is out of it, it would weigh the ſame as did the ſhip with all her materials then in and about her, and the ſmall quantity of water which floated her.</p>
               <p>A ſhip which has the flateſt part of her bottom lying ſixteen feet deep,<note place="margin">On the preſſure of water and leaks at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent depths.</note> (which is often the caſe) the water then preſſes ſixteen times, as much upwards againſt this flat part, as it does on any part of the ſame ſhip about the waters edge, and ſo on to any other part according to its depth. And ſuppoſe this ſhip to have four leaks or plug holes of equal bigneſs, that could be drove out oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, the firſt at one foot under water, the ſecond at four feet, the third at nine feet, and the loweſt at ſixteen feet in the flat part of her bilge; that hole at four feet deep would leak or let in as much water again in the ſame time, as that at one foot deep; and that at nine feet, three times as much; and that at ſixteen feet, four times as much, though it run into the ſhip upwards; and ſo on in proportion to the ſquare root of the height of the water above the leak or plug hole; therefore leaks in ſhips are more or leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, according to their depth under water.</p>

I have tried experiments on the preſſure of water upon bottles of different ſhapes, cork'd up without any thing in them but common air, making them faſt to a lead-line juſt above the lead, when two common ſquare flat ſided caſe-bottles, which would hold about three half pints each, broke at the depth of between ſix and ſeven fathom; but two oval form'd thin <hi>Florence</hi> flaſks about the ſame ſize, bore the preſſure to about fifteen fathom deep; and a quart bottle

round one way, but having two ſides ſomewhat flated, bore about fifteen fathom; and a round common quart bottle, broke only at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty-eight fathom. At great depths I imagine few things that are made hollow and tight, will bear the waters preſſure; I have ſeen an inſtance of its great power, when by my ſhip driving off the bank in <hi>Gibralter</hi> Bay into deep water, our anchors would not reach the ground at a hundred fathom; and when we hove them up, we found our two new nun-buoys had their ſides cruſhed inwards by the waters preſſure.</p>

               <p>WHEN ſhips are contracted for to be built, and their dimenſions agreed upon, the owners commonly want what is called a long floor, which is generally reckoned to make ſhips have all good properties; and this long floor is made by having ſo many floor-timbers exactly of the ſame mold, laid all at equal height on a ſtraight keel, in the mainbody, or moſt bearing part of the ſhip, and are called very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, ſo many dead flats; and then the other floor timbers begin to have more riſe, till they come to ſtand upon dead wood, towards the ſtem and ſtern-poſt, to form the entrance and run of the ſhip.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1112800100:24"/>
any great ſtreſs, by weight or preſſure of fluids, has upon any body that is ſtraight or flat, and how little they will bear in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bodies that are made curv'd or ſome ways circular, ſo as to form ſome ſort of an arch, as may be obſerved in thoſe almoſt flat arches, which tho' made of but ſmall and looſe materials, ſuch as brick and mortar, will bear great ſtreſs and weight upon them. And it's known from experiments by the air pump, how much leſs preſſure of air from without, will break a veſſel that is flat ſided, than will break a veſſel that is rounding or circular; which laſt will bear the whole preſſure of the atmoſphere without being hurt. And the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments mentioned in the ninth page, of the preſſure of water on different ſhaped bottles, ſhew us that the firſt ſquare caſe-bottle which broke at between ſix and ſeven fathom deep, had two of its ſides a little rounding outward, which two ſides came up whole; but the other two being more flat were burſt in, notwithſtanding the extraordinary thickneſs of the glaſs, of theſe ſquare bottles, compared with that of the <hi>Florence</hi> flaſks, which are made like an egg ſhell, and which bore fifteen fathom preſſure. Theſe experiments, and what may be learned from obſervation, ſhew the bad effects which the water often has by its great power of preſſing upwards againſt the long floor of a ſhip, ſo that it ſoon makes the place of theſe dead flats hog and become a hollow upwards, whilſt the ſhip in her upper-works ſeems to keep her proper ſheer; and that this is a fact, may be perceived by any one who takes the leaſt notice, when they ſee long floor'd ſhips laid upon even ground, how the keel, and the floor'd part of the bottom bends upwards; or when put upon level blocks in a graving-dock how hard they bear upon the fore and after blocks, which blocks I have known ſplit, and the keel damaged by the ſtreſs being much more upon its fore and after parts than on that part under the flat of the floor, and that the ſhip has been ſo ſtrained, as to be obliged to be dock'd a ſecond time; which muſt naturally weaken her, and ſhe muſt carry leſs weight in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as her floor is bulged upwards, which muſt form one of the worſt bottoms a ſhip can ſwim upon, by its being a hollow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, where it ſhould be rounding downwards, which in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion would contribute greatly to make ſhips ſtronger to bear the preſſure of the ground, as well as the water, and help their ſailing, ſteering, ſtaying and wareing.</p>
               <p>FOR the above reaſons, and many others which might be given,<note place="margin">To build ſhips with rounding bottoms.</note> I am of opinion, that all ſhips ſhould be built with a root or rank end of a keel-piece fored, and which ſhould be ſtraight all the way below; and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1112800100:25"/>
the upper part work'd with a curve, from the ſtem to the after-part of the floor, ſo that the fore and main part of the ſhip's bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom may be made to form a curve, or be rounding a little down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſuppoſe with about the ſame ſheer as ſhips bends have in common, and the ſtem ſhould project with ſuch a rake forward from the upper part of the keel, that all the horizontal water-lines in the ſhips entrance, may form curves outwards all the way, which will be leſs reſiſted in paſſing through the water, than thoſe unnatural hollows which are too commonly made there, and which I have known to occaſion very deſtructive pitching motions in a fine ſhip.</p>
               <p>THE above method of building, in my opinion, would turn to the advantage of all concerned; for by the floor timbers lying ſo much farther forward on this curv'd part of the keel it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out chocks, or the dead wood fored that is commonly made uſe of; the ſhip will be ſtronger and more buoyant, to carry more, with leſs timber, iron, and workmanſhip. I would recommend the deep end of the keel to project as far forward, before the ſcarf of the ſtem, and the fore gripe added to it, to be as rank as can with ſafety be faſtened; this with the deepeſt part of the keel fored, will make up for what may be thought wanting in the uprightneſs of the ſtem, and the rankneſs of the keel under the loweſt flooring, to help the ſhip ſailing by the wind. The ſtern poſt ſhould have no more rake aft, than juſt to make the back of the rudder ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right when the ſhip is upon an even keel; and the run, or after-part of the bottom, to be according to the main and fore-part: If built full for burden at a ſmall draft of water, the run in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to be fuller and ſhorter, to make her anſwer this purpoſe. But if the ſhip is to be built ſharp, for ſailing faſt by the wind, as well as with the wind large; then ſhe will require a long run, drawn fair, without any extraordinary full part in the water, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it from riſing, and cloſing to its level again, regularly and readily in proportion, as the body of the ſhip may be forced through the water, without making a great eddy, or carrying much dead water after her. But ſharpneſs may be carried to an extreme, for ſhips require a ſpreading body at the water's edge, both afore and abaft, to ſupport them from being plung'd too deep into the ſea, and gives the water more after-body to act upon as it riſes and cloſes abaft, to help the ſhip forward in her progreſſive motion, when ſailing faſt.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Differ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence of ſharp and full ſhips ſailing.</note>FROM experience I can ſay, that the ſharp and ſlight built ſhips will ſail faſter, than the firm and full built in little winds; though when it blows ſtrong, they won't bear to be preſſed with ſail, above

certain degrees to advantage, but otherwiſe; then the fuller and ſtronger built ſhip will have the advantage by bearing preſſure of ſail, and will then perform better in proportion to the ſtrength with which the wind blows.</p>
               <p>I have ſailed in a ſhip built full for carrying, in the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> trade, which was took by a <hi>French</hi> ſquadron, in little wind; but when the wind blew ſtrong, ſhe could be the headmoſt and weather-moſt ſhip in the fleet. The laſt war but one I commanded a ſhip remarkably ſharp and ſlight; ſhe was built at <hi>Malta</hi> for a cruiſing ſhip, from the timbers of their old Galleys; ſhe meaſured above 330 tons, was 88 feet keel, and 27 feet beam, ſhe was built low, with a ſhallow ſhelving bottom every way. In chaſing with this ſhip, when little wind and a head ſea, we have ſteered right up to the chaſe, when all their endeavours could not keep their ſhips head to the ſea, but lay broadſide to the waves. A ſmall preſſure of wind and ſail, would put this ſhell of a ſhip to her utmoſt ſpeed, and when the wind blew with a velocity of about thirty miles an hour, I reckoned (in ſailing large) we could make her go at the rate of about eleven miles an hour; therefore we never deſired more wind but rather leſs than that, to give us all the advantages we wanted in cruiſing againſt our enemies, ſo as to be able to take or leave as we pleaſed. In tacking this ſhip, when it blowed ſo freſh that we could juſt carry whole topſails, we found our advantage in hawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the mainſail and foreſail, to make her ſure in ſtaying, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhe would get ſternway ſo quickly, as to prevent her coming about: this bad property I attributed to the lightneſs of the ſhip's body, which could not bear ſo much ſail aback, without loſing her headway; and the long time ſhe took to bring the wind a-head, was probably occaſioned by her length being out of proportion to her breadth, for a ready and cloſe turning ſhip. This ſhip had another great defect, viz. want of her bow's being fuller, at, and above the water's edge, which would make little or no reſiſtance in the water, to hinder ſhips ſailing in fine weather, but is a great help to their ſailing, by keeping them from plunging ſo much into the ſea, in bad weather, which was the caſe with this ſhip when preſſed hard with ſail upon a wind, for in a great ſea, her bow's being like a wedge, ſhe plunged herſelf under, forward, which not only hindered her ſailing ſo faſt as ſhe would have done, but occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned her ſtraining, to ſuch a degree at thoſe times, that we were obliged to add b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſwifteſt fiſh ſeen in motion at ſea, as well as thoſe fowl which ſwim and dive in water, are all formed with their bodies rounding, as is above recommended.</p>
               <p>I HAD the advantages of the above recommendation farther confirmed by an accidental experiment, made by a commander of a long and flat floor'd collier cat, who is a man of veracity; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1112800100:28"/>
to me, that loading his ſhip at Liverpool with rock ſalt, in order to prevent the ſhip from being too ſtiff and labourſome, he had it ſtowed in as ſhort a compaſs as poſſible, in the middle or main body of the ſhip, and left two great empty ſpaces, one afore and another abaft, which occaſioned the flat floor under the ſalt to bend downwards, and ſo as to make the ſhip very leaky, this, as may be ſuppoſed opened the butts in that part; the ſhip by accident came aground, when he could ſenſibly feel her touch firſt under where the ſalt lay, which was contrary to what he ever felt by her before, and he ſolemnly declared that he never knew the ſhip to ſail, ſteer, ſtay, or ware ſo well before or ſince.</p>
               <p>THERE is another ſtrong circumſtance, which I think is a certain ſign that the rounding ſhaped bottom, and projecting ſtem, is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſhips in general. The beſt trim as they are built now is found to be by the ſtern, this cants the ſtraight part of their long floors upwards, which muſt make a longer reſiſtance farther aft, but then it acts in ſome meaſure, as the rounding bottomed ſhip would do (but to more advantage) upon an even keel, and the more upright a ſhip's ſtem is, the more ſhe will require to be trim'd by the ſtern to make her ſtay, as well as ware readily; for the center of theſe turning motions will be where the center of gravity is, that is about the main frame; ſo that the more upright the ſtem is, the more it will hinder the ſhip turning either way ſo readily, and experience is the beſt guide in theſe matters. I have enquired after the properties of a ſhip that was built with ſtem and ſternpoſt both upright; the report I had from the commander was, that her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance came far ſhort in ſailing, to what was expected, from her bottom, and that before they raiſed her abaft, ſo that ſhe ſtowed more goods there, which brought her to ſail two and a half feet by the ſtern, ſhe oft refuſed either ſtaying or wareing ſo readily, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhips in company would, and now that they are obliged to ſail ſo much by the ſtern, they are much plagued to get the anchors up from under the keel or fore foot, which may be of bad conſequence where there is little room to get under way, ſo that the projecting ſtem gives great eaſe in getting the anchors up readily, as well as helps a ſhip greatly to riſe and fall eaſy, and prevents her from being preſſed or plunged deep into the ſea; for theſe and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good reaſons the ſtem ſhould keep projecting as high as the upper deck.</p>
               <p>THUS I have endeavoured to prove, that to make veſſels paſs through the water with the leaſt reſiſtance, and give them the beſt properties for managing them under ſail, they ſhould have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting

ſtem; the bearing part of the bottom ſhould form an arch downwards, the loweſt flooring at the main frame, and what is called the floor, ſhould be with about the ſame ſheer as the lower part of the bends, and the ſternpoſt ſo near upright, that the back of the rudder may ſtand perpendicular to the keel.<note place="margin">Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms would take the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WHERE ſhips are liable or are deſigned to take the ground, as in dry tide harbours, the rounding bottoms will certainly anſwer that purpoſe beſt, as they may be built either full for carrying, or ſharp for ſailing, as occaſion may require; with little or no depth of keel under the main body, ſo as not to make them lie a long, but as they may ſit quite upright, upon level ground; which will make the principal weight and ſtreſs tend towards the middle of the loweſt flooring, under the main or midſhip frame; where the center of gravity of the whole will be accumulated and ſupported, as upon the crown of an inverted arch, which form muſt be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be capable of bearing the moſt preſſure, with the leaſt da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; and to lay the greateſt ſtrain where it ought to be, upon the middle or ſtrongeſt part of the floor timbers.</p>
               <p>To anſwer the objections which may be made to the want of a deep keel in the midſhips, on account of ſtrength, or ſailing upon a wind, or beating on the ground, 1ſt. I ſay, that making the kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon larger, and its bent downward, along with the ceiling and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide plank in this part, will greatly make up above what may be thought a deficiency in ſtrength. 2d. To make the ſhip hold an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual wind, it has been obſerved, that what keel may be wanting under the midſhip frame, is made up by what is added forward, under the ſcarf of the ſtem; and ſuppoſe a ſhip's keel in common to be a foot deep, all the way fore and aft, and ſuppoſe the round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bottom'd ſhip to have but ſix inches keel, under her midſhip frame, and to have eighteen inches under the ſcarf of the ſtem, this will make up that deficiency forward; and abaft the run becomes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1112800100:30"/>
ſo ſharp and thin, that the plank lies almoſt upright with the plain ſurface of the keel and ſternpoſt. And as to ſtriking on the ground, if the ground is nearly level, ſhips commonly deſtroy the two ends of the keel before the midſhip is hurt, and if they come to roll much upon their keels, the rounding bottom will have the advantage, in proportion as the keel is ſhallower a midſhips; the ſtroke will be leſs, and lower down under the main floorings, where the ſhip by this form of conſtruction is ſtrongeſt, and moſt able to bear repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhocks.</p>

               <p>SHIPS are ſometimes loſt, by having their rudders beaten off in ſtriking upon the ground, which may be prevented by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of hanging rudders, practiſed at Parkgate, and which I think deſerves particular notice, and eſpecially, where the navigation is among ſhoals, or where ſhips are liable to ſtrike upon the ground; this method permits the rudder to riſe about 20 inches, by having bands upon the rudder, the ſame as are in common upon the ſtern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt, with a long iron ſpindle, to go through the eyes of all theſe bands, and which permits the rudder to riſe and fall, as the ſhip happens to ſtrike; and from the good report of foreign ſhips, as well as coaſters, that have tried this method, I think it ought to become more general, where the rudder head comes upon deck, or where it can be contrived to let the rudder and tiller riſe high enough for this purpoſe, which will ſave the ſtreſs from the ſternpoſt, as well as the rudder from breaking and unſhipping, which is often the caſe from the preſent practice, by having thoſe ſhort irons upon the rudder, that are chock'd and ſtopt, to prevent the rudder unſhipping.</p>

               <p>I HAVE tried to manage the ſails in a cruizing veſſel, and in cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmacks a fiſhing, with robbins and points in the ſeamed parts of the ſails only, in order to reef and unreef them with more expedition, and lay the more ſtreſs where the principal ſtrength of the ſails lay, but found from experience that it requires robbins and points in the middle part of each cloth, to confine the ſails cleverly to the yards and gaffs; therefore the holes that are made in the ſingle part of the canvaſs ought to be a little higher up in the ſail, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſtreſs may be upon the ſeams which I reckon is about three times as ſtrong as the ſingle part of the canvaſs. When the ſail is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1112800100:36"/>
ſeam prick'd, as all the foul weather ſails ought to be, in a zigzag or ſerpentine manner, as ſoon as they are ſtretched a little by wear, ſo that if the ſails are not confined to the yard, ſtays and gaffs, more by the ſeam'd part of the ſail than by the ſingle canvaſs, the weight of the ſeams will contribute to ſplit and wear out the ſingle canvaſs much ſooner, eſpecially when the ſails flap hard in gales of wind, or when obliged to carry ſail in little wind with a great rolling ſea.</p>
               <p>INSTEAD of cutting theſe holes through ſo many folds of canvaſs at random with a knife, I take the liberty to recommend to have a round hollow tool or gouge with a mallet, and a block upon the knees, for the purpoſe of cutting the holes more regular.</p>

               <p>WE ſhould avoid all unneceſſary rigging, as well as blocks, for every thing that the wind blows upon, about a ſhip, that don't ſtand in the plane of direction with the ſails, is a hindrance to the ſhip's ſailing upon a wind, therefore the running rigging ſhould not go double, where ſingle will anſwer the purpoſe. Thoſe ſtays to the long topgallantmaſts heads, and the cloſe net-work with bobs, which I have ſeen hanging under the fore part of ſhips tops are uſeleſs tophamper, and crowfeet there, in my opinion, do more harm than good.</p>
               <p>WHERE the jibboom is to go through anupright cap at the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprit end, (which is certainly the beſt way) the end of the bowſprit through the cap, ſhould be left long enough for the collar of the foretopmaſt-ſtay to lie under it, and ſpread on each ſide of the cap, which anſwers good purpoſes, in keeping the ſtay ſo much farther forward, it ſtays the maſt better, and a larger foretopmaſt-ſtayſail may be ſet to advantage, and lets the jibboom go freely out and in as occaſion may require.</p>
               <p>I have experienced the advantage of having the topſail yards, as well as the lower yards, rigged to hoiſt with a double block with two ſtraps upon the yard, to make the ſheaves ſtand fore and aft, and a double block with a long double ſtrap before the croſſtrees, with a leading block at the maſt head, to go as geers, inſtead of tyes, which are conſtantly chaſſing in the tye block upon the yards, by the ſheave ſtanding athwart the ſame way with the rolling mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſhip, which makes the tyes ſo often break, but by the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1112800100:37"/>
above method as geers, the ſheaves of the blocks ſtanding fore and aft, prevent the chaffing by the ſhips rolling motion.</p>
               <p>I AM ſurprized to ſee continued in ſome ſhips, the old practice of having the mizentopſail braces and bowlines go acroſs, when they do as well on the ſame ſide, and gives a clear opening to ſet a large mizentopmaſt ſtayſail to great advantage.</p>
               <p>I WOULD adviſe to have all ropes above ſix inches round, to be cable or double laid,<note place="margin">Ropes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſix inches to be cable laid.</note> that is with nine ſtrands, inſtead of three, with the ſame number of yarns; for reaſon as well as experience teaches us, that all ſingle or ſhroud laid ropes with three ſtrands only, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſix inches round, the outſide yarns in each ſtrand are ſtrained in making the rope hard enough, by being worm'd or twiſted round at ſo great a diſtance from the center, that the yarns about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the ſtrands are by that means made to be ſlack, ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to bear a ſtrain, the outſide yarns muſt be broke, that this is a fact may be perceived when opening a ſtrand of a large ſhroud-laid rope, one ſees there the inſide yarns are drawn up ſlack, when the outſide yarns are worn out and broke, for which reaſon I would recommend the ſtanding rigging above ſix inches to be cable laid, with the ſame quantity of yarns, which will be ſtronger than the ſhroud-laid rope, in proportion, as all the yarns lie in a ſtraighter direction with the length of the rope, conſequently, they all bear more equally a part of the ſtrain.</p>
               <p>I HAVE tried the ſtrength of a number of threads together, made faſt to a ſcale beam, firſt, laid in a ſtraight direction, without any twiſt, like to a ſolvigee; ſecond, the ſame number moderately twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; third, an equal quantity twiſted more, and found from repeated experiments, that thoſe with the moderate twiſt, bore the greateſt weight before they broke, and that a number of threads joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether will not bear a proportional weight to one of them ſingly, that is, ten threads comes a great way ſhort of bearing ten times the weight that one thread bore ſingly, and I reckon the caſe is the ſame with a rope and one of its yarns.</p>

               <p>THE bad conſequence of a ſhip being too ſtiff, I experienced in one of the Governments old twenty gun ſhips, which was bought and fitted out with lighter guns and materials than ſhe formerly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and was loaded with a general cargo of different goods for the Weſt-Indies, ſhe was but about fourteen days at ſea, when down came our main yard, occaſioned by the new main tye, being chafed to pieces in the middle of the rope, or inſide of the ſtrands, by one ſtrand rubbing againſt the other, from the ſhips extraordinary quick rolling motion, and which ſoon wore out the other rigging, and alſo work'd looſe the hull in proportion. With quite a full ſhip from Jamaica, we have rolled away a new ſet of main lanyards in one night, though we uſed in the ſtowing her, all poſſible means that the goods of the different cargoes we carried would admit of, ſo as to lay the heavieſt part as high in the middle of the ſhip as we could, to overcome this bad property; notwithſtanding which when in company with other ſhips, in fine weather, ſailing before the wind
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1112800100:40"/>
with a long following ſwell of a ſea, they all carried their topgal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantſails and ſtudding ſails, without any inconveniency or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when we were obliged to take in our ſtuddingſails, topgallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſails, &amp;c. and lower the topſails half maſt, to ſave the topmaſts from being rolled away. We loaded a cargo of lead and leather, &amp;c. for Leghorn, and ſtowed the lead upon a great height of leather, which we ſcrewed down with boards upon it, to ſupport the lead at a proper height, to keep the ſhip tolerable eaſy in the ſea, which anſwered our deſign, the firſt part of the paſſage very well, but the ſhip working by the motion of the ſea, occaſioned the lead by its weight to preſs the leather a great deal lower, in the latter part of the paſſage, by which ſhe became ſo labourſome as to roll away two topmaſts in ſpite of our beſt endeavours. This experience convinced me, that this ſhip was too broad, and her decks ſay too low in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion for a merchant ſhip, for carrying general cargoes to the beſt advantage, but ſhe was more fit for what ſhe was firſt deſigned, viz. to carry heavy guns and heavy materials above water, which could counterpoiſe and make her more eaſy in great ſeas.</p>
               <p>BUT there are good properties mix'd with bad ones, in ſhips of all conſtructions, the above mentioned ſhip was ſo ſtiff without ballaſt, that we have laid in an open road with the topmaſts an end, and guns upon deck with a clean ſwept hold, ready for her cargo, and we had the advantage of carrying a preſſing ſail, with an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſide upon a wind, our principal care was to look up at the maſt to ſee how much they bent, to prevent their being carried away, when the crank ſhip's ſide would be preſſed down, and make her go heeling much along at the ſame time. But when two ſhips of theſe different properties, meet with turbulent dangerous high waves, then the extraordinary ſtiff ſhip, will be ſo labourſome by a quick jerking deep rolling motion, as not only to endanger the loſs of the ſails, rigging, and maſts, but the hull may be work'd looſe and made leaky, by the ſame violent rolling motion, when the crank ſhip in company at the ſame time, may be comparitively eaſy in riſing and falling with the waves, without that deſtructive rolling motion; for when ſhe is turned upon one ſide, by the force of the wind or waves, her recovery is ſo ſlow, that a danger is apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her not riſing upright again, which ſlow motion is the cauſe that ſhe receives little or no damage, when the ſtiff ſhip may be greatly diſtreſſed.</p>

               <p>THESE are fundamental points which are certainly in a ſhip; and her trim, as laſt mentioned, depends upon their places, but ſo little are they underſtood, as I have been told, that a great ſea officer was heard to ſay, when his ſhip was labouring hard in a rough ſea, how ſhould ſhe but roll when ſhe had ſo much top-hamper? which was aſcribing the effect to a wrong cauſe, and what will be often the caſe till the fundamental principles are known; I am therefore emboldened to endeavour to communicate what I have learned of theſe difficult points, hoping an abler pen, will ſome time undertake to mend and make up my defects, in the knowledge of theſe points, that they may become uſeful to ſeaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>THE center of cavity of a ſhip,<note place="margin">On the center of cavity</note> is a point in the middle of the hold, or hollow buoyant part of the hull, which ſupports her load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and her materials, but it is in reality the cavity, or the center of the bearing part of the ſhips body, that is immerſed in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that acts to ſupport her in all the different ſituations, and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a ſhip is ſubject to, which occaſions this center of the cavity immerſed, to be always ſhifting its place, as the different parts of the ſhips hull happen to be in the water, it moves from being about the midſhip, when the ſhip ſwims upright and upon an even keel, to forward or aft, as the ſhip is trim'd more by the head or ſtern, and from one ſide to the other, in proportion as the ſhip is made to heel.</p>
               <p>THE center of gravity of a ſhip, is a point ſome where in her,<note place="margin">And cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vity.</note> where the weight of the whole ſhip, cargo and materials in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her is brought to a point; when the ſhip ſwims upright and upon an even keel, it is ſome where in a line of direction from the ſtem to the ſternpoſt, and where another line would croſs it about the midſhip frame, from one ſide to the other, where, if the ſhip could be ſuſpended in air, ſhe would lye in any poſition ſhe was put into.</p>
               <p>BUT the center of gravity of a ſhip, is always liable to alter its place, higher or lower, more forward or aft, on one ſide or the other, according to the ſtreſs or weight that happens to be laid, upon the different parts of the ſhip or her materials, not only by the management of the ſtowage, but by the power and preſſure of the waves and wind.</p>

For whenever it happens that a ſhip is laid on ſhore, and heels ſo much that the center of gravity overhangs that part of the ſhips bilge, upon the ground, that ought to ſupport it, the ſhip will be ſure to tumble over, if not prevented by ſome means.

               <p>I TRIED a model of a high full built ſhip, that was rigg'd, and had guns upon deck, ſo that ſhe would but juſt ſupport herſelf from overſetting, ſhe drew five inches water forward, and ſix inches and a half aft, ſtuck pins in the middle of the ſtem and ſternpoſt at the water's edge as before, and found the center of gravity fore and aft, an inch and a half above theſe pins at the water's edge, there put in pins, and tried by heeling her in water as above, and found theſe upper pins, the center of motion or axis, that ſhe turn'd upon, which will always be the caſe, when the center of gravity is above the ſurface of the water, an inſtance of a ſhip launched, agreed with and confirmed the above experiments.</p>
               <p>A MERCHANT ſhip built with a high and ornamented top,<note place="margin">The cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhown by the launching of a ſhip.</note> upon a narrow thin bottom, having her lower maſts in, and rigged when ſhe was launched, and as is common at ſuch times, had a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people upon deck, all theſe raiſed the center of gravity ſo high, and the center of cavity immerſed lay ſo low in her ſharp bottom,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1112800100:45"/>
when ſhe came into the water, that it would not ſupport her upright, but ſhe ſallied and laid down on one ſide, with the black ſtrake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the bends amidſhips in the water, this frightened the people upon deck, and all getting upon the upper ſide, ſhe then ſallied or rolled over as low the other way, and the people as before ſhifted themſelves to the contrary ſide, which made her keep conſtantly thus ſallying, whilſt they towed her with boats about half a mile, and got her to a ſide, where the people gladly got out of her.</p>
               <p>SHE was launched without her rudder, and I had the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of being near her, and obſerved a boat under her ſtern that was held by a man with the boats ſtem cloſe to a rudder-band, about three feet above the water's edge, which rudder-band I perceived to have little or no motion, but was the axis of the center of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and motion, that ſhe turned upon, while ſhe was thus ſallying or rolling, with her upper works in the water, which I reckoned was as high above water, as the keel was under water amidſhips, when the ſhip was upright.</p>
               <p>CAUSES are beſt diſcovered by their effect, from experience and obſervation we muſt find out true principles. This ſhip's ſharp bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom in the water, when ſhe was upright, made too ſmall a baſe, and the center of cavity lay too low, to ſupport her upright, with the center of gravity lying ſo high above water, that it made her ſally or lie down on one ſide, till that brought a broader baſe into the water, and the center of cavity (then immerſed) higher up, and farther over, and without the center of gravity, ſo that the center of cavity then became as a prop, to ſupport the ſhip from going lower, as ſhe ſallied each way, and in this caſe, the center of cavity was the center of motion, that ſhe turned upon, when her ſide was laid down; for all the weight and power that was without the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of cavity acted as a lever, the ſame as when ſhips are hove down keel out, that lifted the center of gravity a little, as ſhe ſallied, which ſoon preponderated again,<note place="margin">The cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and motion are at the ſame place in great ſeas, and a ſhips be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour depends upon that place.</note> and the people always moving over to the upper ſide, accounts for this ſhip's ſallying.</p>
               <p>THIS ſhip's behaviour, and the above experiments, in my opinion, make it evident, that the center of motion of a ſhip, is at the center of gravity, and according to the built of the ſhip, and her center of gravity, being higher up or lower down, the different properties or behaviour of ſhips, may be accounted for; from the conſtruction of the above ſhip, when loaded with refined ſalt, that juſt fil'd her, the center of gravity being then a great height, the report of her performance at ſea was that ſhe anſwered very well, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1112800100:46"/>
was remarkably eaſy in her rolling motion, in great ſeas, tho' the ſpectators at her launching, expreſſed themſelves, that they would be loath to go in her to ſea, on account of her rolling.</p>
               <p>ITS a known property of all heavy bodies,<note place="margin">Heavy bodies turn in ſwift mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and bring their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt end foremoſt.</note> forced into quick mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through air, or water, that they turn upon their center of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity as their center of motion. I have ſeen a bomb ſhell turn round in the air, by the center of gravity being near the middle: and where the center of gravity lies near one end, that heavieſt end will go fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in all directions, upwards as well as downwards, as may be ſeen in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>kyrockets, and arrows ſhot from bows; an arrow ſhot with the light end upwards, immediately turns upon its center of gravity for its center of motion. The ſame cauſes produce the ſame effects upon ſhips, when by high mountainous waves they are toſſed up and down, with a violent quick motion.</p>
               <p>IT muſt be allowed that there is a point in a ſhip which may be called the center of motion, and which ſhe turns upon, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it has leſs motion than any other part of the ſhip, when rolling, pitching, ſcending, or in any other motion, a ſhip is ſubject to, in great ſeas, when its place is then at the center of gravity, which lying higher, or lower, according to the built of the ſhip, contributes to make her comparitively eaſy, or uneaſy, in high waves.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE a well proportioned ſhip for carrying cargoes in general,<note place="margin">Reaſons why a well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned ſhip may be eaſy or uneaſy.</note> could be when loaded, ſo that the center of gravity and motion were even with the ſurface of the water, this would make her remarkably eaſy in her rolling in great ſeas. And again, to ſuppoſe the ſame ſhip without dunnage, to be loaded with lead, which is eleven times heavier than its bulk of water; in a ſmooth ſea, this might ſeem a benefit by making her extraordinary ſtiff upon a wind, and what little ſhe was made to heel to her ſail, would turn upon the center of motion at the waters edge, but if ſhe ſhould meet with great ſeas, ſo that ſhe muſt riſe and fall, in proportion to the height and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the waves, that would give liberty for the center of motion to act with its natural tendency, to the center of gravity, which by this ſlowage would be laid ſo low, that the ſhip would roll away her maſts, and be in danger of foundering, by working her hull to pieces.</p>
               <p>FOR a further confirmation of the above opinion,<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a collier cat load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with timber.</note> I examined into the properties of a collier cat, of about five hundred tons burden, that carried her loading of Riga timber, without any ballaſt in the hold, and had about a ninth part of her cargo upon deck and on the quarters, and was ſufficiently ſtiff, and remarkably eaſy in her
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1112800100:47"/>
rolling, in great ſeas, comparative to what ſhe was, when loaden with Newcaſtle coal, though ſhe carried herſelf full of them, yet ſhe was then remarkably labourſome in her rolling. And this difference may be accounted for, from the above principles, for when this ſhip was loaded with Riga timber, which is lighter than its bulk of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it was computed, that about a third part of her cargo lay above the water's edge, at her loaded mark, which would bring the center of gravity and motion as high as the ſurface of the water, when ſhe drew about ſixteen feet amidſhips; from thence to the upper part of the rigging at the maintopgallantmaſt head, meaſured one hundred and eight feet, which is ſomewhat leſs than ſeven eight parts of the whole, above water; and above the center of motion; and is more than an eighth part under water, and below the center of motion, and what made her ſufficiently ſtiff, was, her extraordinary breadth, and the tight free board, or upper works, above the loaded mark, that ſupported the center of gravity ſo high, and that occaſioned her to be ſo remarkable eaſy in her rolling, as the water and waves acted at the leaſt diſtance, and with the leaſt power poſſible, above the center of motion, on that ſmall part of her hull above her load mark, to move, and give any degree of violent rolling motion, to ſo large a part of her body, that was under water, and below the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of gravity and motion; for what her keel was made to move ſide ways, her topgallantmaſt head had a little leſs than ſeven times more to move in the ſame time,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of being loaded with tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and coal.</note> therefore her rolling motion muſt be much leſs, and eaſier in great ſeas, than it would be, if ſhe was loaded with coal, which is heavier than its bulk of water, and would make the center of gravity and motion lie ſo much lower down in the hold, ſuppoſe four feet below her load mark when ſhe drew ſixteen feet water; in this caſe, the water is perpetually acting with an additional pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, on that four feet of the cavity of the ſhips hull, that is immerſed above the center of gravity, to ſupport the ſhip, and make her ſo much ſtiffer, to carry more ſail upon a wind with an upright ſide, in ſmooth water, as before mentioned; and the ſame cauſe will make her more labourſome in great ſeas, when ſhe comes to be lifted up, with a ſwift motion, from the bottom to the top of a high ſteep moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous wave, that may break in upon deck at the ſame time, as repreſented, plate the 6th on ſhips lying too. The aſcending ſide of the waves in this caſe acts, with an additional power, to turn the ſhip bodily more on her lee-ſide, in proportion, as the center of gravity and motion lie lower, than when ſhe was loaded with timber, and at the ſame time like other heavy bodies in motion upwards, ſhe has
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1112800100:48"/>
a greater tendency to turn her bottom more up, as the center of gravity lies lower, as mentioned page the 33d, and in proportion, as theſe combin'd cauſes have turn'd the ſhips weather ſide up, at the top of the wave, which then leaves the weather ſide, with more of the bottom lower down, without water to ſupport it, which muſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally fall on the deſcending ſide of the wave, which now acts on the lee ſide of the ſhip, to turn and plunge the weather ſide into the hollow of the next wave, which will act as before, to give the ſhip more violent rolling motions, according to her breadth, and the height the waves have to act upon the ſhip's hull, above the center of gravity, and motion, which now lies a little leſs than a tenth part, from the keel to the top gallantmaſt head, ſo that for every foot her keel is made to move by the above powers, ſide ways, the maſt head has nine feet to move, in the ſame time, inſtead of ſeven, with a ſlower motion, which was the caſe when ſhe was loaded with timber, which I hope will be underſtood to account for the difference, why ſhe is more labourſome when loaded with coals than with timber.<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lead without dunnage.</note> And to ſuppoſe this ſhip was to be loaden to the ſame draft of water, without any dunnage in the bottom with lead, which is eleven times heavier than its bulk of water, which might bring the center of gravity and motion eight feet below the waters edge, and within eight feet of the lower part of the keel, which is little leſs than a fifteenth part from the keel to the topgallantmaſthead, in ſuch a trim its well known from experience, that in a ſtorm, the above mentioned cauſes would act with ſo much more power, to give her more quick violent rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling motion, and for every foot her keel was made to move ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, the maſt head would have to move fourteen feet in the ſame time, which would be ſure to make her roll away her maſts, in the firſt place, and after that, become ſo much more labourſome, for want of them, ſo as to be in great danger of foundering, by working looſe the hull.</p>
               <p>I HOPE what has been ſaid on this important ſubject, makes the principles underſtood, how ſhips act, and how they are acted upon, by thoſe natural cauſes above mentioned, and the neceſſity there is to try every expedient, that may prevent the loſs and damage that is done by ſhips being too crank, or too ſtiff; for I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced from experience and obſervation, that it is not the ſhape of the ſhips bottom, that makes her eaſy or uneaſy in her rolling mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is a common notion, but it is the center of gravity lying higher or lower, according to the breadth and height of the veſſel, the water acts with more or leſs power, that makes narrow built

               <p>WHAT we call the helm is the tiller, that turns the rudder on either ſide, of the after part of the keel and ſtern-poſt, for the water to act upon, as the management of the ſhip may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; and as ſhips differ in breadth abaft, ſo ſhould the tiller in its length; that is, the tiller ſhould be juſt long enough to reach cloſe over to each ſide, when the rudder ſtands at an angle of 33 degrees or bears three points of the compaſs from the direction of the keel, which is generally allowed to anſwer beſt; for to make the rudder go more over, is found from experience to increaſe the reſiſtance of the ſhip's way, which leſſens the power of the rudder, to ſteer and manage the ſhip, in proportion as ſhe loſes her way through the water.<note place="margin">Fault of the helm going too much over.</note> Yet in boats and larger veſſels, where the rudder and tiller admit of it, I have ſeen people ſo ſtupid, as to put the helm in tacking almoſt right athwart the ſtern, which tends more to ſtop the veſſels way, than to bring her head round againſt the wind and waves, from one tack to the other.

               <p>IT may not be amiſs here, to endeavour to explain by what means, and upon what principles it is, that this moſt noble and uſeful machine a ſhip, is made to gain ground, and is brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout from one tack to the other, againſt the wind and waves, when they are moderate.</p>
               <p>IT is well known that we have ſhips that will ſail from ſix to nine miles an hour, upon a wind, when it blows freſh and the water is ſmooth, and will make their way good within ſix points of the wind, ſo as to gain to windward, in ſtill water, a third of what they run by the logg; ſuppoſe ſix miles an hour to gain two miles, or nine miles to gain three to windward, with the ſails trim'd in that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique or ſlanting direction as is particularly deſcribed page the 20th, which certainly tends to force the ſhip much more broadſide to lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,<note place="margin">What makes a Ship gain to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> than a-head; for it is a known principle, that a ſhip ſailing with the wind upon the beam, and the plane of the ſails trim'd to four points or forty-five degrees from the direction of the keel, the ſails at that angle tend equally to drive the ſhip broad-ſide to lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as a-head; ſo that a ſhip ſailing and turning to windward as above mentioned, muſt be owing to the ſhape of the ſhip's hull, which makes little reſiſtance in ſailing a-head, compared with the great reſiſtance made by the broadſide in the water, not only by the ſhip's extraordinary length in proportion to her breadth as has been obſerved, but all thoſe thin parts, the dead wood, cut water, gripe, ſtem, keel, ſternpoſt, and rudder, which make very little reſiſtance in the ſhip's going a-head, but a powerful reſiſtance ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; that though the ſails are trim'd in that ſharp direction, yet in a moderate wind when the ſhip can carry all her ſails, by the wind and the water ſmooth, ſhe will ſail with the wind two points before the beam, as faſt, or faſter than ſhe will do when right before the wind, with the ſame breeze. Thus ſuppoſe the wind blows at the rate of ten miles an hour, when one of theſe faſt ſailing ſhips may ſail at the rate of ſix miles, and gain two to windward, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes

the power of the wind one ſixth part, and makes it act equal to twelve miles upon the ſails cloſe by the wind, and if you put right before the wind ſo that we will ſuppoſe the ſhip to go about five miles an hour, this reduces the power of the wind one half, and it has not one half of the canvas to act upon that it has when the ſhip is ſailing cloſe by the wind. To confirm this opinion,<note place="margin">An expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment to prove that when the wind blew 9 knots, a boat ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 5 by the wind and large.</note> I have tried experiments, and found the velocity of the wind in a pleaſant breeze, by a man running on the ſhore right before the wind, ſo as to keep a light vane in his hand becalm'd, when he run with a log-line faſtened to him, five different times to be about nine knots: I then tried a ſchooner rigg'd boat with two ſails cloſe by the wind, and found that ſhe ſailed by the ſame log-line five knots, at five points from the wind; then I put her right before the wind, and tried her with both ſails drawing full, when ſhe went but the ſame five knots by the log, three different tryals, before and by the wind, at the rate of five miles an hour, when the wind blew at the rate of nine miles an hour;<note place="margin">To ſail within 6 points of the wind is near e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a 3 maſt ſhip.</note> I reckon that a faſt ſailing ſhip would have gone as faſt or faſter than this boat, at ſix points from the wind, with her principal ſails braced up to three points of the wind, as before obſerved, which is ſharp and near enough to the wind, for a three maſt ſhip, that has more tophamper to hold wind than a ſloop, or ſchooner rigg'd veſſel, and therefore requires to ſail farther from the wind, to overcome all the reſiſtance that is againſt her, and a ſhip makes more or leſs lee-way in proportion to her head-way, on which depends the power of the helm, to ſteer and bring her about from one tack to the other, in the moſt advantageous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo as to gain ground to windward. I have in chaſing to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward been coming faſt up with many a veſſel that ſailed much nearer the wind than we; for it ſhould be conſidered that a ſhip ſailing at ſix points from the wind, nothing but the ſails properly trim'd contributes to give her headway, and all other parts of the ſhip or her materials, that the wind and waves act upon, tend (two points out of eight) to give her ſternway, and the wind may be ſaid to be reflected, ſo as to act upon the after part of the ſhip, as if it was only three points from being a-head, as may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the fly of the enſign, and the after-ſails upon the mizen maſt ſtanding at an angle of only a point and a half from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the keel, as mentioned page the 20th.

               <p>A GOOD or bad haul in this caſe makes a material differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in gaining to windward, and in wear and tear, and in the eaſe of the people; I have been in a ſhip, that when hauling main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail, it was always catched a-back, as is repreſented figure 2, plate 2d. ſo that we had the maintack to get down five or ſix feet, and the after ſails to trim after the ſhip was tacked; and that this is often the caſe, may be ſeen from the common print of a ſhip tacking, where it is repreſented in the ſame manner; this is owing to the cuſtom of always putting the helm hard a-lee whether the ſhip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it ſo far or no and not hauling the mainſail till the wind is right a-head.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE to make a good haul at the time, when it is known that the ſhip will be very quick in ſtays, the helm ſhould not be put hard a-lee, as cuſtomary, but half down a-lee leſs or more as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience proves to be ſufficient to bring her about before ſhe looſes her headway, to off tacks and ſheets as ſoon as the ſails ſhake, that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1112800100:62"/>
the mainſail may be hauled, with the wind two points on the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bow, as repreſented figure I. plate 2d. This management helps the ſhip in ſtays, and gives time and a favorable opportunity to get the maintack cloſe on board, and the after ſails fairly trimmed by the time they fill, ſo that the people may be all at liberty to haul and trim the head ſails; then the helm ſhould be ſhifted, or righted only, as the ſhip may require, by her head or ſternway, to work her cloſe, and not always hard a-lee, as cuſtomary; for if the ſhip has headway, it may bring her up in the wind; and if ſternway, it may make her fall broad off from the wind, as before mentioned.</p>
               <p>IT muſt be allowed, that the leſs helm a ſhip is tacked with, ſo as ſhe don't get ſternway, the farther ſhe will ſhoot and gain to windward in ſtays, for the rudder ſtops the ſhip's way through the water more or leſs, in proportion as the helm is put over to either ſide. I have tried experiments in a ciſtern of water,<note place="margin">Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made on the helm more or leſs over with a model of a ſhip.</note> with a model of a ſhip, that had the helm prepared to traverſe four points of the compaſs each way, which was marked out from the center of the rudder's motion, and puſhing her right forward through the water with an equal power, firſt with the helm a-midſhips, ſhe went much farther before ſhe ſtopt than ſhe did afterwards, with the helm alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a point at a time to four points, when ſhe ſhortened her diſtance and made a leſs ſweep each trial. And as to a ſhip coming about with little helm, it is well known that will often happen when not intended, by a ſmall neglect of the helm.</p>
               <p>IN narrow channels,<note place="margin">Tacking in very narrow channels.</note> where a ſhip has very little room to turn to windward, ſhe may require the helm to be put down hard a-lee, all at once, and the lee braces forward, ſheets and foretop bowline, all to be let go at the ſame time, alſo to brace the head ſails, which may prevent the ſhip ſhooting a ſhore in ſtays. When this happens the mainſail may be hauled with the wind three points on the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bow, when the after ſails ſhake, and the head ſails take aback, by being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>raced to, which will give more time to get down the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, and to trim the after ſails without hindering, but rather help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhip to ſtay, as before obſerved. For ſuppoſe a ſhip was to be launched head foremoſt, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1112800100:63"/>
no rudder hung, or if ſhe had her helm a-midſhips, by the effect of the ſails only.</p>
               <p>BUT the beſt leſſons for tacking, and working to windward in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle room,<note place="margin">On work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the coal trade to London.</note> are in the Colliers bound to <hi>London,</hi> where many great ſhips are conſtantly employed, and where wages are paid by the voyage, ſo that intereſt makes them dexterous, and induſtrious to manage their ſhips with few men, in a complete manner, in nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row channels, more ſo than perhaps in any other trade by ſea in the world; the ſeamen there go regularly from one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which they know depends upon them, by the great practice they have in turning to windward againſt Weſterly winds, through narrow and ſhoal channels, with their deep loaded ſhips, that are trimmed ſo near an even keel to make them draw as little water as poſſible, and their mainmaſts ſtand farther aft than common; this occaſions them to gripe, which often obliges them to work ſpritſail and all the head ſails they can bear, to make them manageable when turning to windward; in narrow channels, when it blows ſo ſtrong that all hands cannot haul aft the fore ſheet, but are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to heave it aft by the capſton, even then it would be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a great blunder to make a bad haul, obſerving always the ſhip's quick or ſlow motion in ſtays, to off tacks and ſheets, ſo as to be all ready, and haul mainſail in the proper time, whilſt the wind takes the back of the weather or fore leach of the main and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top ſail, which ſwings them ſharp round, with the main ſheet block cloſe aft, and the main tack on the other ſide, cloſe forward to the cheſtree or the tack hole, ſo that they have only to haul in the ſlack of the main tack and ſheet, and trim the after ſails whilſt becalmed by the head ſails, ſo that all hands are at liberty to help to haul and trim the head ſails, when the weather requires it.</p>
               <p>IT muſt be allowed, as mentioned page the 19th, that theſe ſhips being adapted for this trade, are rigged as light as poſſible, to make them work eaſy to windward in narrow channels, with few hands; they have no lifts to the lower yards, no foretop bowlines; and have ſhort main bowlines, and ſnatch blocks for the main and fore ſheets; the main braces lead forward, ſo that the main and maintop bow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lines are hauled and belayed to the ſame pin, the ſame way with the main brace, ſo that one man eaſily lets them all go together at once when the mainſail is hauled, or rather ſwung ſo ſharp round, by the wind, as above mentioned, with ſo ſwift a motion that tho' they haul every thing hand over hand, can only get in the ſlack of the maintop bowline by its going ſingle, which they make faſt to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1112800100:64"/>
keep the ſails thus ſwung ſharp round, till the main tack is got down, and the yards braced up, then haul the bowlines upon the main brace, for the reaſons given, and the ſhip being trimmed near an even keel, with the mainmaſt ſtanding far aft, as before remarked, makes them work cloſe, by preventing them falling much off from the wind, though they may have loſt their head way, when the head ſails are hauled: And they are moſtly built with pink ſterns, rounding inwards in their upper works, that they trim the ſails to ſtand full within five and a half points of the wind, and ſo little tophamper above water, to hold wind, in proportion to other ſhips, that when turning to windward in narrow channels, they beat ſhips that would beat them in the open ſea, which muſt be owing to ſuch reaſons as have been given, and that the running ropes may run clear in making ſhort trips, they don't coil them up, but they let them run as they were hauled.</p>

               <head>Turning to Windward in very narrow Channels.</head>
               <p>SAFETY depends greatly on getting a ſhip at firſt fairly under way, and where there is water enough, it is certainly beſt to heave ſhort upon the anchor, and weigh with the firſt of the tide's making to windward. And if the wind is partly acroſs the tide, it will caſt the ſhip with her head towards the weather ſhore, which ſhe may be kept clear of, by driving with the ſails a-back, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented plate the 3d. figure 2, till the anchor is up and ſtowed; and as the tack towards the weather ſhore is the ſhorteſt, it is pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to back as near the lee ſide as you can with ſafety, to make the firſt board the longer, to get the proper ſails fairly ſet, and to get all ready in time for tacking, and to make as bold as poſſible with the weather ſhore, on which ſide a ſhip is always ſureſt in coming about, and in caſe of miſſing ſtays, a ſhip may be backed off from the weather ſhore as above mentioned, till ſhe has room to fill and ſet the ſails, and get all her head way to try her in ſtays again, without any danger. But when the ſhip is got about to ſtand towards the lee ſhore, where ſhe is not ſo ſure in ſtays; when go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlanting with the tide as going acroſs it, and eſpecially if there runs any waves that may hinder the ſhip ſtaying, and not being ſure of all the ropes running clear upon this tack for the firſt time, therefore it may be neceſſary to put the ſhip in ſtays in good time,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1112800100:65"/>
that in caſe of a miſs, there may be room enough to fill and try her the ſecond time, or to uſe ſuch means as may prevent her going on ſhore.</p>
               <p>BUT when the wind is right againſt the tide, that begins to make to windward, it requires caution, not to weigh the anchor till the ſhip ſwings end on to the tide, and brings the wind ſo far aft, that ſhe may be ſteered right againſt the tide, till the anchor is up and ſtowed, and the ſails with which the ſhip is to work are all ready; as repreſented figure I. plate the 3d. and to haul the wind from being cloſe over to one ſide, which gives the whole breadth of the channel, to get the ſhip fairly under way, cloſe by the wind, and ready for tacking, let the firſt trip be made as ſhort as poſſible, till it is found how the ſhip and people work upon both tacks, and make them longer or ſhorter accordingly afterwards; but care ſhould be taken not to ſtand into an eddy tide on either ſide, which may be perceived by a rippling, which has often occaſioned ſhips to miſs ſtays and go on ſhore.</p>
               <p>THERE is a ſaying amongſt ſeamen, if a ſhip will not ſtay, you muſt ware her; and if ſhe will not ware, you muſt box haul her; and if you cannot box haul her, you muſt club haul her; that is, let go the anchor, to get her about on the other tack; each of theſe maſterly performances deſerve perticular notice.</p>

               <head>On Box Hauling a SHIP.</head>
               <p>MANY advantages as well as ſafety, often depend upon this being put properly in practice; for it often happens, that a ſhip refuſes ſtays, when there is not room to ware in time, ſo as to avoid danger, by the common method of filling the head, and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the after ſails, &amp;c. Therefore whenever a ſhip in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſituation is put in ſtays, and it is perceived that ſhe ſtops com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, before ſhe brings the wind a-head, it is then certain, that ſhe will not ſtay, therefore ſhe ſhould be immediately box hauled, by keeping the helm hard a-lee, and haul off all; bracing about the head as well as the after ſails, hauling cloſe forward the lee fore and foretop bowlines, and up mizen and down after ſtayſails at the ſame time; the wind will then act upon the ſails thus aback, and the water upon the lee ſide of the rudder, by her ſtern way, will box the ſhip ſhort round, upon her keel, with her ſtern up to the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1112800100:66"/>
wind, far enough aft for the after ſails to draw full the right way to act with the helm, which muſt be ſhifted hard a-weather when the ſtern way ceaſes; ſo that the head way with the wind ſo far aft, will readily bring the ſhip round on the other tack. The main and fore tacks are eaſily got down when the wind is upon the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſhivers the ſails, the main ſheet eaſily haul'd aft, and the after ſails braced up and trimmed ſharp, as the ſhip brings the wind more aft, which help her round the faſter, till the wind comes on the other quarter, that the mizen and mizen ſtayſail may be ſet to take the right way, to bring her to the wind, whilſt you tend and trim the head ſails, as ſhe comes to.</p>
               <p>BOX-HAULING may be proved to be the ſureſt and readieſt method to get a ſhip under command of the helm and ſails, to anſwer many occaſions in little room, as well as to ware, and bring her from one tack to the other, with the leaſt loſs of ground to lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, when a ſhip refuſes ſtays.<note place="margin">Why a ſhip loſes little ground in box-haul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> Nice managers of ſloop rigged veſſels, turning to windward in narrow channels, when they want but little to weather a point, rather than make another tack, have a practice of running up in the wind till the headway ceaſes, then they fill again upon the ſame tack, this they call making a half board: thus a ſhip in Box-hauling may be ſaid to make two half boards, firſt running with her head, then with the ſtern up in the wind, by which two motions, a ſhip if well managed, rather gains to windward, and brings the wind almoſt aft, by the time the ſtern way ceaſes, ſo that ſhe is under the command of the weather helm, and the after ſails, to bring her ſhort round, on the other tack, with the firſt of the headway, in which time only it is that the ſhip goes any thing to leward, worth notice, in Box-hauling; therefore it ſhould always be put in practice on theſe occaſions, by putting the ſhip in ſtays, though it is known ſhe will not come about with her head to windward, and in a gail of wind and high waves, or when there is not people enough to manage and haul the head ſails, the after ſails only may be hauled, and the fore ſheet hauled cloſe aft again, when its perceived that the ſhip has done coming to, as is repreſented plate the 7th, of a ſhip imbayed on a lee ſhore, which ſhall be ſpoke of in its place.</p>

               <p>THIS is to get a ſhip from one tack to the other, by letting go an anchor, when by an eddy tide, or by a ruff ſea, or being out of trim, or from any other cauſe, ſhe refuſes to ſtay or ware, in time to avoid danger. When this happens in ſhoal water, found by the lead, that if the ſhip has not water over her anchor, ſhe ſhould have ſternway given her, and not headway when the anchor is let go, and the weather anchor is likelier to go clear of the ſhip than the lee one, therefore both bower anchors ſhould be ready on theſe occaſions.</p>

               <head>On a Ship driving to Windward with the Tide.</head>
               <p>IT often happens that there is not room to turn a veſſel to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward through a crowd of ſhips, or in narrow channels, but ſhe muſt drive by the help of the windward tide.</p>
               <p>A SHIP in this ſituation, muſt be managed according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner you deſign to proceed, for if the tide is ſtrong enough, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the wind, ſo that ſhe will drive faſt enough to windward, ſtern foremoſt, it will certainly be the beſt, as it may be done with or without any ſails ſet, the yards being braced ſharp up, as repreſented plate the 3d. figure 1. A ſhip may be ſteered at pleaſure, and to a great nicety, end on to the tide, and ſhe will drive ſtern foremoſt in leſs room than her own length; but it will require above three times her length to drive broadſide, if the wind is right againſt the tide; and dexterous management is required on ſuch an occaſion, becauſe a ſhip will always ſhoot and tend towards that ſhore a-head of her, ſo that you cannot drive far upon one tack, though with the ſails a-back, without waring at times, to drive on the other tack, or the ſhip will ſoon ſhoot on that ſhore a-head of her, which I have ſeen inſtances of in ſpite of all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to back a-ſtern.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:1112800100:68"/>REASONS, why ſhips ſhoot a-head, more than they can be backed a-ſtern, when driving broadſide with the tide, though the ſails are a-back.</p>
               <p>SHIPS in general have a longer and ſharper run-aft than they have an entrance forward, the ſternpoſt and rudder ſtand more upright, than the ſtem and gripe, and they ſwim more or leſs by the ſtern; therefore the after part of a ſhip muſt be more powerfully acted upon by the windward tide, than her fore part in the water, which conſequently ſets her ſtern more to windward than her head, which at the ſame time is more acted upon by the wind above water than her ſtern, in proportion as the foremaſt, and all belonging to it, is larger and ſtands further forward than the mizen maſt ſtands aft, and the bowſprit, with the jibboom, and all that belong to them projecting ſo far over the bows, and nothing projecting over the ſtern to hold wind, in the ſame proportion abaft; they muſt natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſe the ſhip to drive with the wind moſtly a-baft the beam.</p>
               <p>AND though the moſt effectual means are ſuppoſed to be uſed on ſuch occaſions, to keep the ſhip's bow to the wind, and prevent as much as poſſible her falling off and ſhooting a-head, by letting her drive with the after ſails braced flat a-back, the mizen hauled out, the helm a-lee, and the head ſails kept ſhivering, as is repreſented by figure 2, plate the 3d. where it appears as if a ſhip might be backed a-ſtern at pleaſure, yet experience proves the contrary, and the following reaſons may be added to thoſe above mentioned: The helm muſt be kept a-lee when driving in this way, and though the after ſails are a-back, the ſhip will ſhoot a-head, and back a-ſtern alternately, but ſhe will come to with a ſlow motion by her head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, till ſhe brings the wind before the beam, which gives her ſtern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and makes her fall round off upon her heel, with a quick mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and brings the wind ſo far abaft the beam, that ſhe ſoon gets headway again, ſo that ſhe will ſhoot much farther a-head than ſhe backs a-ſtern, which makes it difficult to drive broadſide with the tide, right againſt the wind, in little room, with ſafety.</p>
               <p>BUT I have heard of this difficulty being overcome, by two veſſels driving broadſide with their ſterns confined near together by a rope, that each veſſel could check and command the other, at pleaſure, to keep in a fair way, which I think is practable to the advantage of both veſſels, as they may drive without any ſails, only hoiſting a ſtayſail occaſionally.</p>

               <head>To drive a Ship Broadfide to Windward, with the Tide right againſt the Wind.</head>
               <p>IT is a maſterly and neceſſary piece of ſeamanſhip, to be able to perform this with ſafety, where there is very little room, as is repreſented plate the 3d. where the ſhip figure 1. by the help of a ſtrong tide, may be ſuppoſed to have drove ſtern foremoſt, right to windward, where it was too narrow to drive broadſide, and is got where there is but juſt room and tide enough to drive broadſide, which may make a great deal of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the ſhip's driving according to the wind and tide; for if we ſuppoſe the wind blows ſo freſh that the ſhip cannot be made to go leſs than at the rate of two miles an hour, through the water, when driving ſtern foremoſt, the tide muſt run at the rate of three miles, to make her drive one mile an hour to windward, but where the tide runs but two miles an hour, the ſhip will then be at a ſtand between wind and tide, but when ſhe is brought to, and drives broadſide, as repreſented by figure 2. ſhe may not drive above half a mile through the water; ſo that what is the difference between that and what the tide goes, ſhe will drive to windward.</p>
               <p>A SHIP may drive ſtern foremoſt without any ſail, as ſhe only, requires ſteerage way to command her, and the leſs way ſhe has through the water, the faſter ſhe will drive, ſo that when it blows freſh, to contrive and make ſtop waters may be of ſervice to help her to windward. But to bring a ſhip to, where there is little room, ſo as to drive broadſide, will require the three topſails, the mizen, and the jib and foretopmaſt ſtayſail, to be ready to hoiſt, to make her manageable to back, or fill, ſtay, or ware, as may be requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for to endeavour to bring a ſhip to without ſail to throw a-back occaſionally, ſhe would perhaps ſhoot on that ſhore a-head before ſhe loſes her headway.</p>
               <p>NOW let us ſuppoſe that the ſhip figure 1. plate the 3d. after driving ſtern foremoſt as above mentioned, has ſet her topſails bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſharp up with the larboard braces, in order to bring to, and drive broadſide on the larboard tack. In this caſe the ſhip ſhould be ſheered as near the ſtarboard ſhore as ſhe poſſibly can with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then put the helm hard a-ſtarboard, hauling out the mizen as ſoon as it will take the right way, ſo as to bring the ſhip round to,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1112800100:70"/>
with the topſails a-back, to prevent her ſhooting too near the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board ſhore.</p>
               <p>A SHIP bringing to with much headway, will bring the wind near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly right a-head, by the time the headway ceaſes; then the helm ſhould be ſhifted hard a-weather, and the ſails being a-back, will ſoon give her great ſternway, by which means a ſternboard may be made to back her as near the ſhore a-ſtern as poſſible; for, as it has been obſerved, a ſhip driving broadſide may eaſily be ſhot a-head, when ſhe cannot be backed a-ſtern, and this is the only time a ſternboard can be made to advantage at the ſhip's bringing to; for when the ſternway ceaſes, the helm muſt be put and kept hard a-lee, and the ſhip muſt drive with the main and mizen topſails a-back, the mizen hauled out, and the foretopſail kept ſhivering, as is repreſented figure 2. plate the 3d. and if the mizen ſtayſail was ſet with the ſheet to windward, it might help to keep her more to the wind, ſo that ſhe might drive the farther on one tack, before you are obliged to ware her to drive on the other tack, which muſt be done as ſoon as the ſhip is perceived to draw near the ſhore a-head, which will always be the caſe with a ſhip driving right to windward, for the reaſons given.</p>
               <p>WHEN you intend to ware as a ſhip is always coming to, and falling off, by her head and ſternway when thus driving, take the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, when ſhe has juſt done falling off by her ſternway, as ſhe is then as far a-ſtern as ſhe will be upon that tack, and the wind as far aft, being then all ready, up mizen, down mizen ſtayſail, (if ſet) ſhiver the main and mizen topſails, fill flat the foretopſail, up jib and foretopmaſt ſtayſail, (if neceſſary) ſhift the helm hard a-weather, the tide then ſetting round the ſtern, as is repreſented by the ſhip's wake and boat to windward figure 2, it will act with ſuch power upon the rudder in that direction, that with the firſt of her headway, the ſhip may be wared, and proceeding as before, brought to, ſo as to drive on the other rack; in this manner a ſhip may be managed, to change tacks, and drive right to windward with the Tide, in leſs room than any one would think poſſible that has not had the experience.</p>
               <p>BUT inſtead of waring as laſt mentioned, I cannot help thinking it would be better to put the ſhip in ſtays, filling the after ſails flat, keeping the foretopſail juſt drawing full, till the ſhip comes to, ſo that it will take a-back to help her about, and if ſhe ſtays, let the helm lie, as it will then be, a-weather; the ſhip may then be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by making a ſternboard towards the ſhore a-ſtern, at pleaſure;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1112800100:71"/>
and if ſhe refuſes ſtays, it gives a favourable opportunity to brace the topſails a-back, and box-haul her round, as has been deſcribed page 53, by which ſhe will loſe leſs ground than by wareing, and the ſhip's trim may require this practice, as it is known that loaded colliers will ſtay when they will not ware, and when light in bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt, they will ware when they will not ſtay.</p>
               <p>THE above management is founded on a ſuppoſition that a ſhip is to drive through a long ſtraight reach, or channel, where the tide runs true right againſt the wind.</p>

               <p>DRIVING in a crooked or ſerpentine river, as repreſented plate the 3d. the tide commonly runs winding like the river, from a point over into a bay on the other ſide, and out of a bay again paſt the next point, into the next oppoſite bay, &amp;c. therefore at the bottom of each bay, where the tide begins to ſet out again, the ſhip ſhould be put on the other tack, to drive with her head towards the next point, as repreſented by the ſhip figure 2, by which means a ſhip may be backed a-ſtern, to drive clear of the ſhore a-head, upon both tacks.</p>
               <p>WHEN the wind blows a point or two of the compaſs, acroſs a tide that runs true, a ſhip driving with her head towards the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide may be eaſily managed, ſo as to keep in a fair way, by backing, filling, or ſhivering the ſails, and the more the ſails can be kept ſhivering, the faſter the ſhip will drive.</p>
               <p>THOUGH a windward tide helps a ſhip to work, and makes her manageable when driving to windward, yet it is very neceſſary to have an anchor ready to let go, as occaſion may require.</p>

               <head>On bringing a Ship to an Anchor.</head>
               <p>VARIOUS ſituations and different ſorts of harbours, roads, and coaſts, different directions and ſtrength of winds, waves, and tides, make it impoſſible to fix certain rules to bring a ſhip pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to an anchor, at all times and places. Yet in my opinion, a great deal may be ſaid on this ſubject, that deſerves notice. And firſt it may be neceſſary to make ſome remarks on coiling cables.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>On Coiling CABLES.</head>
               <p>IT may be the loſs of a ſhip, to coil a new cable with the ſun, as it is termed, before it is properly ſtretched, or the end taken through the coil, for it is almoſt ſure to come up in kinks when yeered out, and eſpecially in cold weather. The greateſt depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence being on new cables, they are commonly kept in reſerve till the other cables, or the anchors, give way, which makes this bad practice in coiling them the more dangerous; therefore it ſhould be firſt conſidered, how to manage the cables, to make them work and coil to the beſt advantage, and run clear of catch ſakes as well as kinks.</p>
               <p>A CABLE, in my opinion, works and wears much better for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iled the ſame way that it runs round the windlaſs, or bitts. Therefore the cables for the ſtarboard anchors, which work round the windlaſs againſt the ſun, ſhould be coiled againſt the ſun, and thoſe for the larboard anchors coiled with the ſun, as they work that way round a windlaſs, and as they run out round the bitts the contrary way, ſo that the cables ſhould be coiled accordingly. And to make new cables anſwer this practice, is, the firſt time, to coil them with the ſun, over the cable tier hatchway, with larger o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> leſs ſakes, according to the limberneſs or ſtiffneſs of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ope, and take the upper end through the coil, to coil it down in the tier; this will make the rope pliable to coil, and veer out eaſy, clear of kinks, either with or againſt the ſun.</p>
               <p>TO coil a cable to run clear of catch ſakes, the cable ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be laid out from the inſide ſake to the outſide ſake, at the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1112800100:73"/>
farther end of the cable tier, fartheſt from the hatchway; this will likewiſe coil the cable ſo nuch lower in that part near the hatchway, ſo as to give more room and height to bend and coil the cable, and for the bends to upſet clear when veering away.</p>
               <p>THE bad cuſtom of coiling cables with the ſun, ſo as to run in kinks proceeds firſt from the rope-makers, who for their eaſe, coil them that way to ſend them to the ſhip, where, without thought, they are too commonly coiled down the cable tier the ſame way, becauſe a new cable before it is well ſtretched, will always bend of itſelf that way in coiling, for the rope opening againſt the lay, gets clear of a turn at the bend of every fake, which is the reaſon that a new cable bends and coils ſo eaſy this way; but when this cable comes to be veered out, this turn muſt come into the cable again at the upſetting of every bend; but the lay of the rope inclines it to keep clear of this turn, which prevents the fakes from upſetting, and cauſes it to come up in kinks, by which bad practice I have known many narrow eſcapes. Therefore all new cable-laid ropes, hawſers, and towlines, as well as cables that require to run clear of kinks, ſhould be either coiled againſt the ſun, till they are well ſtretched, or with the ſun, and the end taken through the coil as before mentioned; for the ſame reaſon, as it is well known, that a coil of new rigging will not run clear of kinks, without the end is properly taken through the coil. But to coil a new cable againſt the ſun, that is from the right hand to the left, requires a turn to be forced into the lay of the rope, at the bend of every ſake, which makes it troubleſome to coil this way; but this turn in every fake, makes the bends upſet of themſelves, ſo that the cable veers out very eaſy.</p>
               <p>NOW if we may ſuppoſe that the anchors and cables are all ready, ſo as to be ſure of running clear: The next things to be conſidered, are the depth of water, the room, ſtrength of the wind, waves or tide, where you expect to anchor; alſo that the buoy and buoy rope, range of cable, handſpikes, ſtoppers, ring-ropes, and buckets of water to throw on the windlaſs or bitts, be all ready, as occaſion may require, and to give as great a ſcope of cable as the place will permit, before you offer to bring the ſhip up, becauſe the length and weight of the cable, will contribute greatly to eaſe both the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor and cable, as well as the ſhip, when the waves run high, for which reaſon, I have known ſhips have the inner ends of the ſheet and beſt bower cables ſpliced together, ſo that by overſetting one cable, they could vear out both upon one end, to either anchor, if
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1112800100:74"/>
neceſſity required it, for it is well known, in a ſtorm when the waves run high, and eſpecially in deep water, that a ſhip will ride much eaſier and longer by two cables, or more, upon one end, to one good anchor, than by two anchors with a ſingle cable to each. For to ride by two anchors, they muſt lie far enough aſunder on each bow, to prevent one anchor from hurting the other cable, by which a ſhip ſeldom pulls hard upon both cables at the ſame time, but firſt pulls hard upon one cable; if but a ſhort ſcope, it plunges her deep into the ſea; then that ſtrain draws the ſhip towards that anchor, which ſlackens that cable; ſo that by the next wave ſhe ſtrains hard upon the other cable, and ſo on ſhe pulls firſt at one and then at the other, which cauſes a ſhip to labour, and be very uneaſy in the waves, in compariſon to what ſhe would be, if riding by one good anchor and a great ſcope of cable, which admits the ſhip to fall and riſe eaſy with the waves, without hauling the whole length and weight of the cable off the ground, which makes the anchor hold longer without coming home.</p>
               <p>IN letting go an anchor, care ſhould be taken that the ſhip does not hurt herſelf upon it, in caſe of ſhole water, and that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor is not fouled by the cable getting about the fluke or ſtock of the anchor, which may prevent its holding the ſhip when any ſtrain comes upon it.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>To come to an Anchor when the Wind is right againſt the Tide.</head>
               <p>IT ſhould be a rule to ſhoot the ſhip a-head of the anchor, or ſheer her clear of it, upon the ſame tack you deſign to ſhoot her upon, the next tide, endeavouring always to keep the ſhip in ſwinging with the tide on one ſide of the anchor, to keep clear of it, for reaſons that will be given in its place on keeping a clear an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor. As it is repreſented plate the 3d. it may be ſuppoſed that the ſhip driving to windward has got to an anchoring birth, or the tide is ſo far ſpent that ſhe will drive no farther, to windward, and muſt come to an anchor on the ſtarboard tack. In this caſe at let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting go the anchor, the ſhip ſhould be ſhot a-head of it, and kept a-head with the helm a-weather, and the yards braced full with the larboard braces, and the foretopmaſt-ſtayſail and mizen ſet full, as is repreſented by figure 3, plate the 3d. till the windward tide is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1112800100:75"/>
done, that ſhe falls to leeward and rides windroad, with the wind, anchor, and cable right a-head, as repreſented figure 4, plate the 3d. in which poſition ſhe will lie till the next windward tide.</p>

               <p>WHERE there is room, it is certainly neceſſary to full the ſquare ſails, as the ſhip is running before the wind and tide, and to take room to bring her to, by putting the helm hard over to ſtarboard or port, and haul out the mizen to bring the ſhip's head up as much as poſſible, againſt the wind and tide, at letting go the anchor, which will contribute greatly to bring the ſhip up with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and eaſe, compared with that bad practice of letting go the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor as the ſhip runs right before the wind and tide, without hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſquare ſails, which adds all that extraordinary force of the ſhip's way through the water, to the ſtrength of the wind and tide, which increaſes the ſtrain and rubs the cable to a dangerous degree, by which I have ſeen great damage done, as breaking the cable, &amp;c. which might have been avoided by bringing the ſhip to, and letting go the anchor as above recommended.</p>
               <p>THE damage that is often done on this occaſion, proceeds from want of conſideration; for as it has been obſerved before, a ſhip ſailing right before the wind, and a ſtrong tide, does not feel the real ſtrength of the wind; therefore apprehending no danger, lets go the anchor as the ſhip runs, which if it does not make ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing give way, muſt greatly ſtrain every thing that is immediately concerned in bringing the ſhip up.</p>

               <p>WHERE it can be done, the ſhip ſhould be always put upon that tack that ſtems againſt the tide, when the anchor is let go; and if it is deſigned to continue at a ſingle anchor, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to keep it clear, I would recommend to ſheer and keep the ſhip to leeward of the anchor, by keeping the helm a-weather, and

               <p>GREAT advantages may attend letting go the anchor ſteming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the tide, and eſpecially where the tide runs over rapid, for it gives an opportunity to take notice at what rate the ſhip may be going a-ſtern, ſo as to judge whether it may not be neceſſary to keep ſail ſet, in order to help to bring the ſhip up, and ride eaſy in a rapid tide. I have been where we let go the ſmall bower anchor, with all ſails ſet, with a freſh breeze of wind againſt the tide, and veered out the whole cable, and the ſhip ſtill drove; then we let go the beſt bower anchor and veered out all that cable, by which the ſhip brought up; and road ſo cloſe to a ſhole a-ſtern, that we were obliged to ride with the helm a-port, to keep the ſhip with a broad ſheer, to prevent her touching the ground, which would have been fatal to the whole: the rapid tide would have overſet the ſhip, broke away her maſts, and turned her over and over upon the ſhole, which would probably have been the caſe, had it not been for the ſails being kept ſet, which helped to bring the ſhip up and ride.</p>

               <p>THE beſt anchoring births in theſe places are commonly well known by marks, which the firſt ſhip naturally takes up, and has a right to keep, clear from any other ſhip anchoring ſo near as to make her a foul birth, as is repreſented by plate the 5th, where the ſhip figure 1, may be ſuppoſed to be come to an anchor, in the beſt birth, having the caſtle and windmill in one line, and the houſes and church in the other line of direction, pointing exactly to the anchor; theſe particulars ought to be wrote down in the logg book, as ſhould likewiſe the bearings by the compaſs, of extreme points of land, ſholes, rocks, or ſands, all which it may be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to remark, ſo that a courſe may be ſteered to keep clear of them, if the ſhip ſhould be drove from her anchors in the night, or in thick weather, and that the anchors may be found again by the marks made when they were let go, if their buoys ſhould diſappear.</p>
               <p>IF it is a tide, or trade wind road-ſteed, the next ſhip that comes ought not to anchor right a-head, or a-ſtern, of the firſt ſhip, ſo as to lay in each others hawſe, but ſhould come to upon the bow and quarter, at a proper diſtance, to prevent other ſhips from coming between, and in a ſlanting direction from the tide or wind, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the ſhips figures 2 and 3, plate the 5th, this in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion might contribute to the ſafety of ſhips in ſuch places as the <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>To keep a clear Anchor when the Wind is right a-croſs the Tide.</head>
               <p>I STRONGLY recommend the ſimple and eaſy method of ſetting the foretopmaſt ſtayſail with the weather ſheet flat aft, and the helm a-weather, whereby the ſhip may be ſheered, and kept near the ſame place to leeward clear of her anchor, both ſtood and ebb, as repreſented by the ſhip figure 1, where ſhe naturally muſt be each ſlack tide in the ſituation as repreſented by the ſhip figure 2, plate the 4th. But this method of ſheering a ſhip to leeward, being quite contrary to that bad cuſtom which is practiced in the coal trade, of ſheering ſhips to windward of their anchor, and though I allow them to be the greateſt proficients in managing ſhips in narrow and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult channels, hope to convince them that their practice in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is wrong. But Dame Cuſtom, I know from experience, is a powerful adverſary, and a great enemy to improvements, and will ſeldom ſubmit to conviction; notwithſtanding that, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make a fair compariſon, by deſcribing both methods, as they are repreſented in plate the 4th, which was made for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe only, and then leave the merit of both to the determination of impartial judges. Firſt, then let us ſuppoſe the wind to be off ſhore, and right a-croſs the tide, as is repreſented plate the 4th, and that the ſhip figure 1, is commanded be Capt. Reaſon, and came to an anchor on the larboard tack, fleming againſt the tide, as deſcribed page 62, with her helm a-weather, to ſheer the ſhip to leeward of the anchor, which method not only keeps the ſhip clear of her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, but alſo makes her ride ſo near end on to the tide, with the wind rather abaft the beam, that ſhe may be helped with ſail, to ride eaſier in a rapid tide; and when the tide is moderate, ſhe will lie ſheered right to leeward of her anchor, where ſhe muſt be at each ſlack tide, as has been before obſerved. And if we ſuppoſe that ſhe came to an anchor at ſlack tide, as deſcribed page 62, ſhe will then lie with the cable and anchor in the ſame direction, with the wind right a-head; ſo that when either tide makes, ſo as to bring the wind upon the bow, they have only to hoiſt the foretop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt ſtayſail, with the ſheet to windward, and put the helm a-wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1112800100:84"/>
to keep her anchor clear, as you ſee repreſented by figure 1, plate the 4th.</p>
               <p>Now we will ſuppoſe Dame Cuſtom commanding the ſhip figure 3, in the ſame plate, comes to an anchor on the ſtarboard tack, ſteming againſt the tide, and puts the helm a lee, which ſheers the ſhip, and lays her anchor in a ſlanting direction to windward, as repreſented by figure 3, till the tide begins to ſlack; then ſets the mizentopſail a-back, and in little wind ſometimes adds the maintop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail a-back, to back the ſhip a-ſtern clear of her anchor, which makes her form a ſweep half round her anchor, according to her ſcope of cable, from her being near right to windward to right to leeward of her anchor, as repreſented from figure 3, to figure 2, where the ſhip muſt naturally lie in that ſituation every ſlack tide, with the wind and anchor right a-head, till the other tide makes; then they ſhift the helm a-lee, braces a-back the mizentopſail and yards, &amp;c. and ſheer the ſhip nearly right to windward, to complete almoſt the circle quite round her anchor every tide, as repreſented from figure 3, to figure 4, where it appears plain, the ſhip is made to take up above twice the room of the ſhip figure 1, conſequently in that proportion her cable rubs over twice as much ground, and is more liable to ſweep foul of ſtones, wreck, or loſt anchors, &amp;c. which may greatly hurt it, and it may get under the upper fluke of her own anchor, if the anchor does not turn in the ground as the ſhip is ſheered round it, which probably will be done at the laſt and firſt part of the tide, when it runs eaſy; when if the wind is mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and the bottom a tough clay, it is great chance but the anchor lies with the ſtock to windward, by the ſtrain upon it in that direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as above mentioned, and the cable may go over the ſtock when lying flat upon the ground, as the ſhip was backed to leeward of the anchor, and may ſweep under the upper fluke as ſhe is ſheered to windward again, which makes it evident, that by this practice, Dame Cuſtom is likely to ride with the cable foul of the upper fluke of the anchor, as repreſented figure 4. And to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the wind and tide ſo moderate, that the ſhip does not drive, yet the ſtrain upon the upper fluke may cant it towards the ſhip, and raiſe the farther ſtock arm off the ground, by which in a clay bottom, the anchor may perhaps lie in that poſition, ſo that when the tide ſlacks, and the ſhip is backed from figure 4, to figure 2, it will clear the cable of the anchor ſluke; and as they ſheet to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward again, from figure 2, to figure 3, the cable is likely to ſweep under the anchor ſtock arm, that lies canted off the ground. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy

the adherents of Dame Cuſtom to account for their cables ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten getting under the anchor ſtock, which naturally lies flat upon the ground, but by this bad practice.</p>
               <p>AGAIN ſuppoſe Dame Cuſtom comes to an anchor at ſlack tide, the anchor will naturally lie in the ſame direction with the ſhip and wind right a-head; and when the tide makes, inſtead of keeping the ſhip to leeward, as repreſented figure 1, then old Dame ſheers and lies to windward of the anchor, as above mentioned; and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the wind to change, and come ſo far a-baft the beam that the ſhip cannot be backed a-ſtern of her anchor, but ſhoots a-head as the tide ſlacks, in this caſe, if it is good holding ground, we may reaſonably ſuppoſe that the anchor has not turned in the ground as the ſhip has gone round it; the cable will then naturally ſweep the upper fluke of the anchor, ſo that Dame Cuſtom is likely to be a-drift with the lee tide, if it blows freſh, or the tide runs ſtrong, and may carry other ſhips a-drift with them, which makes it dangerous for Reaſon to lie near Dame Cuſtom, in crowded roadſteeds, which muſt make great confuſion when one ſheers their ſhip to lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the other to windward of their anchor, they may ſheer on board each other, which I have known to be the caſe, and Dame Cuſtom has then abuſed Reaſon, by calling him lubber, for ſheering the ſhip to leeward of her anchor, when Reaſon, who had obſerved their wrong proceedings, wagered in his own defence, that Dame Cuſtom's anchor was then ſoul, which proved to be ſo at heaving up.</p>
               <p>THERE is ſo much to be ſaid againſt this bad cuſtom, of ſheering to windward of the anchor, that I am ſurpriſed how it came into pract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>RULES cannot be fixed to ſuit all places and all ſhips, but different methods may be neceſſary, according to the road, the ſize of the ſhip, her draft of water, and how ſhe may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with ground tackle, &amp;c. Where the tide runs very ſtrong, and there is water enough, it is certainly beſt to moor water ſhot, the anchors and cables lying in the ſame direction with the tide, which can then have but little effect upon them, in compariſon to what it has when a ſhip is moored a-croſs the tide, where the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the tide alone upon the moorings, is of itſelf ſometimes enough to bring the anchors home. Therefore great ſhips that have ſheet anchors, and are well manned to clear the hawſe, when obliged to lie where the tide runs ſtrong, moor with the beſt and ſmall bower anchors, water ſhot; but ſmall ſhips, having only two bower an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors, and but few hands to clear hawſe, drawing leſs water, may moor out of the ſtrength of the tide, with the ſmall bower and ſtream anchor, and hawſer a-thwart the tide, and keep the beſt bower anchor in reſerve, as occaſion may require.</p>
               <p>WHEN a ſhip is to be moored only to wait for a fair wind, the beſt anchor, and open hawſe, ſhould be towards the foul wind quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but when a ſhip is to lie with all winds that may blow, the beſt anchor and open hawſe ſhould be towards the worſt wind that may blow, to raiſe the waves, and give the ſhip a pitching motion, as is mentioned page 65, and muſt leave no more of the ſmalleſt moorings within board, than juſt enough to freſhen the hawſe on occaſion; by which they will hold the longer, by having the longer ſcope, and the hawſe will be the eaſier cleared.</p>
               <p>WHERE a ſhip is liable to ground with the ebb, and not to float till the flood tide runs ſtrong, the ſafeſt method is to moor a-croſs
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1112800100:87"/>
the tide, which lays the ſhip clear from getting damage upon her own anchors; then it requires to attend and ſlack the mooring, that her ſtern may ſwing over upon the flood, to prevent her girting. And when moored with a ſmall anchor and hawſer, the helm ſhould be always ſhifted, to ſheer her towards the ſmall anchor, to eaſe the ſtrain upon the ſmall moorings; and to lay the principal ſtreſs upon the bower anchor and cable, to ride the ſhip when the tide runs ſtrong.</p>
               <p>I HAVE been mooring a ſhip in a very narrow river, where the ſhore on each ſide was nothing but looſe ſhilly ſtones. We laid the bower anchor cloſe over to one ſide of the river, and made faſt a hawſer with a long bowline knot, to the middle of a twelve feet deal board, buried on the oppoſite ſhore under the ſhilly ſtones, broadſide, and its lower edge a little ſlanting towards the ſhip, which held her better than an anchor would have done in its place. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remark of this kind, which I think deſerves notice, is what I have known done, where anchors placed one to back another could not be made to hold in ſand, but a bulky bundle, made of ruſhes that grow on ſand hills, buried under the ſand, and trampled upon, has held ſo that it would break a cable made faſt to it; and no doubt but any thing of the ſame bulk would anſwer the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;</p>

               <p>IN roads where ſhips are liable to be put in great motion by waves, which may make dangerous deſtruction of the moorings with a foul hawſe, and the danger and trouble there is in clearing it, when the waves run high, make it highly neceſſary to endeavor to cauſe the ſhip to ſwing the right way each tide, to keep the hawſe clear, which the wind will do when it blows a-croſs the tide, as may be ſuppoſed in plate the 5th, and that the wind was off the ſhore a-croſs the tide, when the ſhip figure 1, was moored with an open hawſe towards the ſhore, to wait for a fair wind; whilſt that wind continues, the ſhip will ſwing with her ſtern from the ſhore, and keep a clear hawſe without any trouble, but when the wind comes to blow right oppoſite to one tide, and in the ſame direction with the other tide running along the ſhore, as repreſented by the ſhip figure 1, plate the 5th, then it requires management to make
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1112800100:88"/>
the ſhip ſwing with her ſtern from the ſhore, to keep the hawſe open on both tides. The method of proceeding the firſt part of the windward tide, when the wind is right a-head, is fully deſcribed page 68, and to ſwing a ſhip the latter part of a windward tide, when the wind is right aft, requires only to put the helm over that way her ſtern is to go, as in this caſe to ſtarboard, which will bring the wind on the larboard quarter; if it is little wind, the mizen, mizen ſtayſail, and mizen topſail braced up ſharp, may be ſet, to aſſiſt the helm as the tide ſlacks, to ſwing her the right way to keep the hawſe clear, without the trouble of towing with a boat, running out a rope, and a ſmall anchor, &amp;c. which a calm, or the ſetting of the tide may ſometimes require to be done.</p>

               <p>AS ſafety may often depend upon this, not only when the waves run high, but in ſmooth water where the tide runs ſtrong, and by giving the moorings a trembling motion, may chaif them; therefore care ſhould be taken to have them well ſerved, not only in the way of the hawſe and cut-water, but ſo far as to reach below the gripe; for a ſhip moored water ſhot, or at a ſingle anchor, with a windward tide, when it blows ſo freſh that ſhe ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges about, and lies a-head of her anchor, with a tight cable, which may be hurt under the bows and gripe, if not ſerved low enough. Therefore it is certainly beſt to have the cables properly ſerved, ready for mooring, as the time and place the ſhip is to lie in may require, as our <hi>Eaſt India</hi> ſhips in the paſſage home, when in a fine weather climate, put the proper ſervice on their mooring cables; and in the coal trade to <hi>London,</hi> they put on their cables what they call a long and ſhort ſervice, to continue on for the ſummer's work.</p>
               <p>THE beſt ſervice that I know to preſerve a cable from chaiſing in a ſtorm, when the waves run high, are ſuch as are uſed in the coal trade to <hi>London;</hi> it is cut from the beſt part of a tanned horſe hide, big enough to wrap two or three times round the cable, which is readily and eaſily put on and taken off and much better than plats commonly uſed in merchant ſhips, which is long and troubleſome to paſs, and beat about the cable; and after that is liable to become ſlack as the cable ſtretches, and rubs backward and forward in the hawſe; and when the ſhip pitches hard, it ſometimes ſeparates and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1112800100:89"/>
makes openings between the parts of the plat, ſo that the cable may be chaifed in theſe openings, which a leather ſervice is not ſubject to, being all the length of the hide in one piece. The method of putting it on the cable, is, firſt to wrap two or three fold of old canvaſs, the length of the leather ſervice, which if too ſtiff to put on dry, requires only dipping in water, and beating it againſt any wood, which makes it immediately ſoft and pliable; then let as many hands as can come at it, wrap it as tight as poſſible upon the old canvaſs, round the cable, tying it tight and ſmooth on with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit, or three yarn nettles, made for that purpoſe, greaſing them and the ſervice very well before veering it into the hawſe hole.</p>
               <p>I WOULD adviſe to avoid a practice I have ſeen uſed on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that is taking a timber hitch with ſome nettles round the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon the canvaſs, then wrapping the leather ſervice and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <head>Rules commonly obſerved by a good Leads-Man.</head>
               <p>WHEN firſt ordered to the lead, he takes care that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward end of the line is made faſt, to prevent looſing it. 2d. That the lead and line may run clear, and come fair to hand, he takes them out before that ſhrowd next to his foremoſt hand where he ſtands to heave. 3d. The firſt caſt of the lead he only heaves out about ſix or ſeven fathom of line, which prevents the lead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over hove, and readily makes known that the ſhip is not in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate danger, when no ground is found at that depth; and it is an eaſy way to clear the line for a deeper caſt the next heave, if the occaſion requires it. 4th. When ſounding in leſs than five fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom water, or when there happens a ſudden alteration of leſs wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he heaves the lead as faſt as poſſible, and ſpeaks out the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing briſkly, with a loud voice, and does not ſing them out, which takes ſo much time that I have known a ſhip to come a-ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſounding was made known.</p>

               <p>THIS cuſtom is certainly a benefit to a fleet of ſhips, ſailing near together in difficult channels, where ſafety depends upon the lead, as in the coal trade to <hi>London,</hi> where I ſuppoſe the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: began; and finding the advantage of hearing each others ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as a guide to the whole.</p>

                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:1112800100:92"/>ANOTHER advantage attending this practice, is, where a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander is not well acquainted, he may go of the deck, and look at the ſoundings laid down in the chart, or inſtructions for the place, and hear the depth of water ſung out at the ſame time to compare how they agree.</p>
               <p>BUT it muſt be allowed that there are riſks attending this practice, by the lead's-man ſtanding ſtill all the time he is ſinging out the ſoundings; for which reaſon the above 4th rule for a good lead's-man, ſhould be ſtrictly obſerved, to avoid the danger there menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, to have happened whilſt the lead's-man was ſinging out the ſoundings, with a long tone, thus, <hi>bee, thee, mark, three,</hi> &amp;c. in which time the ſhip came a-ground, which might have been avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had the ſoundings been ſpoke out quick, as above recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This makes me think, that it may be a diſputed point whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſoundings may not be as well or better heard, when ſpoke out quick with a loud voice, than when they are ſlowly ſung out; if ſo, the advantage muſt be greatly in favour of ſpeaking out the ſoundings, on all occaſions.</p>

               <head>On Sounding with the DEEPSEA LEAD.</head>
               <p>I WOULD recommend what I have found from experience to be an advantage, that is, having this lead only fifteen pounds weight, with a ſmaller line than common kept ready upon a reel, made large enough for the purpoſe, like a log reel, and hung up in beckets, where a man can readily take and hold it between his hands, on any ſudden occaſion; and that the lead may ſink the faſter, to have ſmall and few marks, as the hand-lead and line will get ſoundings at any time, in ten fathom water; the deepſea line need only be marked from ten to ſeventeen fathom, as common, and from twenty upwards with knots as ſmall as thoſe in the log-line.</p>
               <p>THIS lead requires various methods of heaving it, according to the depth of water expected, and the ſhip's head or lee way at the time the lead is to be hove When a ſhip is ſailing right an end, without much lee way, if ſoundings cannot be got by heaving it from the cat head, or ſpritſail yard, a man muſt carry the bight of the line to the jibboom end, and with a tight line ſwing the lead forward, when a man gives it all the force he can from the ſprit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail

               <p>THE difficulty of getting true ſoundings, in a gale of wind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes in proportion to the depth of water, and the violence of the wind and waves. The beſt method that I have experienced, is to paſs the lead from the weather quarter, round the ſtern to lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, without all to the fore part of the quarter deck; and a man to carry the bight of the line to the lee main yard arm, which is to be laid ſquare when the helm is put a-lee, to bring the ſhip too; and when the ſhip begins to ſhoot to windward by her head way, then the lead is to be ſwung right to leeward from the deck, whilſt the man at the yard arm, with a tight line, ſwings it as far as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to leeward of the ſhip, which gains to windward of the lead whilſt the head way continues, and then runs her ſtern up to the wind by the ſternway, backs near to where the lead was hove, by which means, as mentioned in box hauling page 53, a great deal of line may be run out, nearly up and down; and the lead being armed with tallow, makes it certain whether it has ſtruck the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom or no, and if it has, ſhews what ſort of a bottom there is.</p>
               <p>WHEN and how oft it may be neceſſary to try for ſoundings, muſt be left to the diſcretion of the commanding officer, and will be more or leſs ſo, according to the nature of the coaſt, place, or ſituation of the ſhip; the want of it being done in due time, is well known to have occaſioned many fatal loſſes. Therefore they who neglect heaving the lead, will always be blamed in proportion to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of danger, and the loſs the neglect may occaſion.</p>

               <p>I WAS in a ſhip bound from <hi>Liſbon</hi> to <hi>Mazagan,</hi> a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon on the coaſt of <hi>South Barbary,</hi> with which in very fine weather and a fair wind, falling in as we thought by the latitude obſerved, we were in a fair way to find the place, the latitude of which we had only laid down in an old general chart, on a ſmall ſcale. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all of us ſtrangers, we traced the coaſt cloſe along ſhore by day, and laid the ſhip to at night; thus we ſearched for the place ſo long in vain, that we deſpaired of finding it, therefore it was reſolved to try if it was poſſible to turn the ſhip to windward, againſt a lee cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent then running, and go to <hi>Gibralter</hi> to get a pilot to find the place, when in our way back, we found it was above a degree of latitude to the northward of where we had ever looked for it, owing to its being wrong laid down in the chart, and to our officers not getting every poſſible information, concerning a place where we were not acquainted before proceeding on the voyage.</p>

               <head>On LOOK-OUT.</head>
               <p>A GOOD look out may juſtly be ſaid to contribute more than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing towards ſafety, not only from ſhores or ſhoals, &amp;c. but from ſhips running on board each other at ſea, which no doubt often has, and may prove fatal to all thoſe who neglect it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the utmoſt care ſhould be taken, that this duty is not done in a careleſs manner; and the tranſgreſſors ſhould be puniſhed.</p>
               <p>I WAS in a ſhip, in company with a fleet of ſhips of war, turning to windward in the night, with a freſh breeze of wind, when our mate of the watch, as walking the weather ſide of the quarter deck, was alarmed with hearing called out from another ſhip, "a good lookout before there," and an anſwer made by ſeveral "aye, aye," —the mate ran to leeward, looked under the mainſail, and ſaw a frigate on the other tack running right on board us; her jibboom run within our lee mizen ſhrouds, and tore them all away; her ſheet anchor fluke took our main chain plates, tore them all away, and plowed away the plank and timbers till it got clear through our ſhip's ſide, before one ſhip ſtopt the others way; and were ſo locked and entangled together, that had it been a ruff, inſtead of a ſmooth ſea, as it happened to be, one or both ſhips muſt have ſunk, before they could have been got clear of each other.</p>
               <p>THIS ſhews, notwithſtanding the ſtrict diſcipline uſed on board our King's ſhips, that this important duty is negligently done there, as well as in other ſhips, by careleſs men not conſidering how much depends upon their looking out, when ſculking or diverting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſtories upon the forecaſtle; they without looking out at all, will anſwer regularly to the word of command, aye, aye, which occaſioned the above misfortune. For theſe reaſons, as long as the weather permits, the lookers out ſtationed on deck, ſhould be made to walk each man by himſelf, which will prevent them from being diverted, or ſleeping on this duty; for it is well known that a man may ſtand and ſleep, but he cannot walk and ſleep; and to make this duty both eaſy and well done, it ſhould be taken ſpell and ſpell, according to the number of the watch that can be truſted, and as circumſtances may require.</p>
               <p>THE wideſt and cleareſt part of the ocean muſt be allowed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a lookout; for any two ſhips that are croſſing each others

track, may meet and deſtroy both; and the worſe the weather, the more occaſion there muſt be for caution. I was croſſing the weſtern ocean, where we had a very narrow eſcape, ſailing with a gale of wind, quartering under mainſail and foreſail, when the lookers out upon the forecaſtle, ſeeing a light right a-head, took it for, and ſaid one to the other, it is a ſtar, for which it paſſed till we came ſo near, before it was perceived to be a ſhip lying to with a light out, that we only juſt got clear of her ſtern, by putting our helm hard a-port, which juſt ſaved both ſhips from deſtruction.</p>
               <p>TO prevent being deceived on this occaſion, I think it neceſſary here to remark, that when any light appears in the horrizon, or near the water's edge, that it cannot be a ſtar, for the atmoſphere or air ſo obſcures the ſtars, that they cannot be ſeen to riſe or ſet in the horrizon. When drawing near to any danger, where ſafety may depend entirely on a good look out, if the weather permits, and the ſhip is manageable, and will work under her topſails, with the mainſail and foreſail in the brales, it gives a fair opening for the officer as well as others upon deck, to look round them, to ſee any dangers as may appear. The little difference thus made in the ſhip's ſailing, is not to be compared with the advantage given for ſafety, or preventing damage on ſuch occaſions.</p>

may properly be called and underſtood to be the northermoſt part of the world's orbit, as we then enter into what is now the norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſtellation in the ecliptic, called Gemini, which makes our ſhorteſt day, when at the ſame time the South latitudes have their longeſt day; the reaſons for it, and the other ſeaſons of our year will appear evident, by having our world delineated on the eight capital points of this compaſs ecliptic, N. N W. W. S W. &amp;c. round the ſun, as Mr. FERGUSON has done in his 5th plate of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, from which, and a ſcheme he drew for me to make obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on the tides, I formed this deſign of what I call the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's ſyſtem, and had one drawn and put upon a wheel work pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netarian, to obſerve whether our neighbouring worlds paſſing near us in their orbits, had any influence on the tides, but found none.</p>
               <p>THUS by having our globe repreſented in different parts of her orbit which ſhe moves in, at the rate of near one of the 360 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the ecliptic every day, and in that time turns once round on the center of her daily motion, which is at the poles that lie in a direction of 23½ degrees, inclinable towards the plane of her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and the year round always keeps pointing towards the ſame part of the ſtarry firmament, as is evident to any common obſerver, who may ſee how our North pole always points towards what we call the North pole ſtar, that never goes below our horrizon in North latitudes, by which, and a little thinking, it may be perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in general, how our nights and days, with their alterations, and the ſun's declination are brought yearly about, by the ſun always enlightening that half part of our globe that is turned directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; and as it is on the 21ſt. of December when our globe is on the North point of the ecliptic, when I would have the year for this ſyſtem to begin, when the ſun ſhines directly upon the South tropick, its light reaches 90 degrees round on our globe, takes in all the South polar circle, where it is all day, by its then pointing moſt towards the ſun, when it is all night in the North polar circle, becauſe it points moſt from the ſun, as repreſented in the figure on the North point of the ecliptic.</p>
               <p>BUT by comparing ſmall things that can be ſeen, often helps us to form an idea of what is too big for our ſenſes to diſcern; a bomb ſhell of 12 inches diameter, forced into motion through our air, may be ſeen by its fuſe to keep turning round and round on its cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of gravity, as it moves forward; ſo our globe, in round numbers about 8000 miles diameter, inſenſible to us, moves forward in her orbit, as may be ſuppoſed, at the rate of about 1000 miles in every
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1112800100:102"/>
minute of time, whilſt it is known to keep regularly turning on the center of its poles a quarter of a degree of longitude, which makes 15 degrees for every hour of time, that brings about midday and midnight to all the different parts of our globe, between the polar circles in 24 hours, as they are repreſented by the 24 meridians in the figures, which all center or croſs each other at the poles, divides our globe into the 360 degrees of longitude, Eaſt and Weſt, as well as meaſures the 360 degrees of latitude, North and South.</p>

the dexterity of their men to work and manage them, in narrow channels and tide-ways, their crews in common being a mixture of good and bad ſeamen, and in heaving up their anchors with a wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs, the efforts of the good men are loſt among the bad, who for want of practice or a willing mind, do not keep time to heave al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together with the good men, but heave in a lubberly manner one after another, which occaſions the great difference mentioned in heaving up that anchor, which ſeven men performed, much better than eighteen whoſe ſtrength was ſo divided.

               <p>GOING with the ebb tide, makes it much more dangerous than proceeding with the flood, and eſpecially where there is a great flow of water, which falls faſt in proportion, ſo that if the ſhip comes a-ground there is little chance of getting off again that tide, therefore it requires the more care and caution, and when it happens that you are obliged to proceed forward in the night, if a boat can be ſent to ſhew a light where the buoys or dangers lie, that you have to paſs, I can ſay from experience, it may often prove a good method to keep clear of the ground.</p>

               <p>HOW far it may be right or wrong in bad weather, to keep beating againſt contrary winds in dangerous narrow ſeas, may be a diſputed point, and it muſt be left to the diſcretion of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and diſcerning officer, who will conſider his riſk, wear, and tear, with all the advantages or diſadvantages, that may attend beating at ſea, and that if obliged to bear away for a road ſtead, even there, the wear, and ſometimes loſs of the ground tackle muſt be conſidered, and alſo that the ſhip is liable to drive, or be drove on board of by other ſhips. So that when a ſhip can be kept at ſea with any prudent degree of ſafety, though ſhe cannot get, but may looſe ground, yet the chance it gives of being in a fair way for a change of wind, and that by its varying but a little, it may give an opportunity of making ſlants to get round a point or head land, or through the narrow ſeas into the clear open ocean, by which bravery there has been many inſtances of ſhips making a voyage, and one did ſo to the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> and back again from <hi>Liverpool,</hi> whilſt others were waiting there all that time for a fair wind.</p>
               <p>BUT in a tide way, when the wind and weather, and the naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſuch, that admits a ſhip to ſtop tide, this gives ſo great an advantage to gain ground to windward, that it may be deemed wrong to lie waiting for a fair wind, for it may be ſaid, that the ſhip not only gains all that the tide runs her to windward, but it makes her hold a better wind, to make her ſail faſter a-head, than ſhe would do with the ſame breeze of wind in ſtill water, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſhe makes leſs lee-way, ſo that in ſmooth water it may be reckoned that the ſhip gains about one third to windward of what ſhe ſails by the log, as mentioned page 44; this added to what the tide runs may gain a great way to windward in a tide's working. When a ſhip comes to an anchor at ſlack tide,<note place="margin">Remarks when ſtopping tide.</note> and the cable is veered out to ride by all the lee tide, then heaving the lead, and the log every hour after, till the next ſlack tide, will give a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opportunity to obſerve the ſetting and ſtrength, or velocity of it, and what it ebbs or flows in every hour the whole tide, alſo the time of each ſlack tide, with the moon's age, and her diſtance from the earth if it can be got, all which deſerve to be particularly remarked in the journal.</p>

is to ſtand on the other tack, with the windward tide, as far as the ſituation will admit with ſafety, to get and keep to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that may give the opportunity to ſtand upon the ſlant tack the whole lee-tide, ſo as to looſe little ground, and ſave the riſk of ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the lee-tide by coming to an anchor.</p>

               <p>A Good helmſman, when a ſhip is difficult to be ſteered, at taking the helm, he firſt obſerves how it lies, then looks with a ſharp eye which way the ſhip is inclined to go from her courſe, and moves the helm with a briſk motion far enough to ſtop her that way, and feels by the ſtreſs upon the rudder ceaſing, (which feel ought always to be noticed, as well as any alteration to the eye) when it is a proper time to eaſe the helm to prevent her from going on the other ſide of her courſe, for a ſhip is no ſooner ſtopt by the helm from going to one hand, than ſhe will be inclinable to go to the other hand, if the helm is let lie in that place, therefore he keeps moving the helm with a briſk motion, as far as is found neceſſary, to confine her to the courſe, and by feeling the marked ſpokes of the wheel, as they come into his hands, ſoon perceives how much helm, and how far ſhe requires it each way, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and ſteer her ſteadily along, with the leaſt helm, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to himſelf.</p>
               <p>A BAD helmſman inſtead of endeavouring to confine the ſhip to her courſe, by moving the helm each way as above-mentioned, commonly lets the helm lie until he ſees the ſhip is got on one ſide of her courſe, then moves it ſo far as to bring her to her courſe again before he offers to ſtop or meet her with it, and then ſhe gets on the other ſide of her courſe, ſo as to require a great deal of helm both ways, by that the ſhip is ſteered but little right forward, but kept yawing about from one ſide of her courſe to the other, which ſhortens the diſtance gone, and makes both courſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance very uncertain, and works the bad helmſman as he works the ſhip from ſide to ſide, which makes both very uneaſy, and if the waves run high, when carrying a preſſing ſail large, by bad ſteering there is great danger of broaching the ſhip to, therefore none but the beſt helmſmen ſhould be permitted to ſteer at ſuch times.</p>

               <p>IN a variable wind's way, when a ſhip has got ſea room, clear of the land, I have thought it a wrong practice, to ſteer upon a wind, by the vanes, and ſails juſt touching full, which ſeldom gives a direct courſe, but varies as the ſhip comes to, and falls off, which makes both courſe and diſtance the more uncertain; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a courſe ſhould be ordered to a point, or half a point of the compaſs, as the wind will admit, to ſteer the ſhip with a full ſail, and only look at the vanes to ſee if the wind alters, that the courſe may be altered accordingly, by this means, a truer courſe as well as diſtance, and more diſtance may be got, eſpecially if the ſhip lies a ſlant towards her true courſe, which makes it the more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as the ſhip will ſail the faſter, and make leſs lee-way, and this laſt ſhould be well conſidered, becauſe the ſhip's real courſe by the compaſs, depends much upon making a proper allowance for her lee-way.</p>

               <p>THIS, in a moſt inconſiſtent manner, is generally left for 24 hours, to the judgment and memories of the different naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1112800100:121"/>
who probably are below, aſleep, or their attention taken up with other things great part of the time, this therefore muſt make the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for lee-way very uncertain, as it is liable to vary, and be more or leſs every hour, as the wind happens to vary, blow leſs or more, or the waves run higher or lower, more a-head or a-ſtern of the ſhip, and as ſhe has been ſteered upon a wind, though under the ſame ſail, and differs greatly from any ſchool boys rules, that can be propoſed of allowing more or leſs lee-way, according to the ſail a ſhip can carry; for it is well known that two ſhips may be in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with equal ſail ſet, when one, by her conſtruction and trim, may not make half ſo much lee-way as the other.</p>
               <p>THIS defective and uncertain manner of making allowance for lee-way, in my opinion is one of the principal cauſes and reaſons that can be given, why the reckonings in the ſame ſhip ſhould differ ſo much from each other, when the courſes and diſtances that the ſhips way is reckoned from, are all taken from the ſame log-book, which, if no miſtake be in the calculations, ſhould make them all nearly agree.</p>
               <p>WHAT in my opinion would contribute greatly to leſſen this defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of navigation, is to have a quarter of a circle of ſheet lead, divided ſo as to make the eight points of the compaſs, nailed upon each quarter, with one ſide parallel to the keel, and the other to the beam, as they have in moſt capital ſhips, by which the ſhip's wake, or drift, that ſhe goes to leeward of what ſhe ſtems by the compaſs, may be ſet to a ſufficient nicety upon both tacks by the officer of the watch, who ſhould make the allowance, and ſet down the real courſe or drift, made by the compaſs every hour, which by this means will certainly come much nearer the true courſe, than when left without any rule, to different peoples memories, and judgment as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>

               <head>On Meaſuring a Ship's Way by the LOG.</head>
               <p>THIS method, defective as it is, muſt be made the moſt off, till a better is brought into practice.</p>
               <p>The Learned have, with much ſeeming reaſon, recommended to us to have our log-lines marked 50 feet to a knot, and the glaſs to meaſure 30 ſeconds of time, which are exactly 120th part of a geographical mile, and of an hour, and muſt be allowed to agree better with exact calculation than our common practice of having but 42 feet of line, to a glaſs of 28 ſeconds of time, which line is four feet eight inches, or about a ninth part ſhort of the above pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, yet in our practice this is found from long experience to meaſure very well a geographical or ſea mile of 60 to a degree, which mile in my opinion ſhould become general, and be uſed in the ſcale of all our ſea maps, inſtead of our Engliſh ſtatute mile, which is about a 7th part leſs, by which difference the unlearned may be deceived.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:1112800100:123"/>COMMON practice can only be proved to be right, by frequent fair trials, I was mate of a ſhip in the <hi>Jamaica</hi> trade from <hi>London,</hi> outward bound, and we marked the log-line ſeven fathom to a knot, to a 28 ſecond glaſs as uſual, till we were diſappointed of ſeeing our expected land-fall according to our reckonings; our commander then aſked how we had marked the log-line, he was anſwered ſeven fathom to a knot, he then ordered the line imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to be new marked eight fathom to a knot, and ſaid that the ſhip was one eighth part ſhort of her longitude, by the line being marked ſeven fathoms inſtead of eight to a knot, and ſo it proved, for we made the land as he ſaid. But in our paſſage home by this rule, we found the ſhip a great deal above an eighth part of the longitude a-head of all our reckonings, which nearly proved of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal conſequence, as we were carrying all the ſail poſſible with a weſterly gail of wind and hazy weather, when we luckily perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the colour of the water that we muſt be in ſoundings, and it proved ſo, and found ourſelves far up the King's channel in a fair way, and we had eſcaped a great riſk of running the ſhip on ſhore unexpectedly with all ſails ſet. This convinced me that it was not the fault of the log-line being marked ſeven fathom, but another cauſe that may be mentioned hereafter, and that is known always to have this effect upon ſhips in their voyages to and from the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> ſo as to make more difference of longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude out than they do home.</p>
               <p>

In a voyage to <hi>Leghorn,</hi> the ingenious Mr. <hi>Smeaton</hi> ſent with me for trial his above-mentioned ſea-way meaſurer, and ſome other now marine inſtruments, which made me take extraordinary pains to have our log kept nicely marked as above, and to be hove regularly every hour, in order to find out by experience how many turns of this way meaſurer anſwered to a mile; to fix this to a greater certainty I took an opportunity that then offered, and ſteered to the weſtward, till we could ſteer croſs the bay of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1112800100:124"/>
that theſe proportions for the log anſwer very well if proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended to, and therefore cannot be the cauſe which occaſions bad reckonings, and if it is an error, it muſt be allowed to be on the beſt and ſafeſt ſide, that the reckoning ſhould be rather a-head than a-ſtern of the ſhip, to put people upon their guard in proper time, to prevent the fatal conſequence that may attend an unexpected land-fall.</p>
               <p>THE readieſt and ſureſt way to mark and try the log-line, is,<note place="margin">To mark the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ne and try the glaſs.</note> to have the whole length of the half knot (21 feet) meaſured and marked ſtraight along the deck, and to have the knots put into the line ſo as they may be eaſily ſhifted backwards or forwards, as the ſtretching and ſhrinking of the line often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. But before this is done, the half minute glaſs ſhould be tried, whether it runs exactly 28 ſeconds, that if it is found to run more or leſs, the line ſhould be marked longer or ſhorter according to theſe porportions, as 28 gives 42, what will a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or two more or leſs give? and this may be done ſufficiently near by the ſcale and compaſs. And the glaſſes may be tried by a muſket ball faſtened to a thread held ſteady in one hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the finger and thumb exactly 29 inches from the ball, which muſt be ſwung by the other hand, and continued ſwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than thirty times, by which I have found from frequent experience each ſwing then meaſured a ſecond of time ſufficiently near for this purpoſe, even when the ſhip had ſome motion from the waves. But the beſt inſtrument for this purpoſe, as well as many other uſeful and curious purpoſes at ſea, is a good watch, or time keeper, that ſhews ſeconds, which will anſwer equally well in a ſtorm when the waves run high, as in ſmooth water, therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry officer that has the charge of navigating a ſhip, ſhould have one of the beſt he can afford to buy.</p>
               <p>IT is a ſufficient trial for the quarter minute glaſs, if it runs cut exactly twice, for the half minute glaſs once. But after all one's care in finding out exact proportions, by which to get the true diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance run, the whole depends chiefly on thoſe who heave the log, and hold the glaſs, neither of which ſhould be done by careleſs peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, eſpecially when the ſhip ſails ſo faſt as to require to uſe the quarter minute glaſs which will double all errors, therefore this glaſs ſhould be as ſeldom uſed as poſſible.</p>
               <p>THE Learned as before mentioned, have very juſtly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have the line that is run out above the knots, ſet down in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms of 5 feet each, being the tenth part of their 50 feet knots.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1112800100:125"/>
The ſame exact rule may be eaſily uſed, only by having a meaſure of four feet, two inches and a half, marked on the rail, on each quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where the log is hove, that will meaſure tenths of a mile from our 42 feet knots, which muſt be allowed will come much nearer the true diſtance, and agree much better to the tenths of miles in the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe tables, than that old and bad practice, of ſetting down nothing leſs than the half knots, or that more exact method of marking down to fathoms of ſix feet, and theſe tenths of a knot above or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the knot or half knot, might be very eaſily meaſured by the officer that heaves the log.</p>
               <p>BUT after all the exacteſt rules, the moſt effectual method in my opinion to try what dependance can be put upon the log, and thoſe that heave it, is that I have before mentioned, if opportunity per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, clear of tides or currents, after a good obſervation had for the latitude, that is, to allow for the variation and ſteer due north or ſouth, till a ſecond obſervation, if it can be done in a favourable time, which will give the trueſt real diſtance that can be got at Sea to compare with the Log.</p>

               <p>IT ſurpriſes me to find this old bad practice, ſtill continued in many capital merchant ſhips, becauſe it makes the unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble errors in getting the true courſe and diſtance, not only greater but doubles them in working the day's work, and marks down not nearer than half knots of the odd line, which muſt ſtill increaſe the errors of the diſtance, for if we ſuppoſe two fathom of odd line is omitted to be ſet down every time the log is hove, this makes a difference of near ſeven miles in the 24 hours.</p>
               <p>THIS practice lies under another great diſadvantage, which is that of not affording ſufficient room to ſet down and explain the neceſſary remarks and occurrences, that often happen in the twenty-four hours.</p>

               <p>BUT it muſt be allowed, that they who have been accuſtomed to the old method, may be a little perplexed in working the day's work, and reckoning thoſe odd fathoms, or tenths of a knot, that is left over above the miles the ſhip has gone on any one courſe, and which is under no fixed rule, but when they amount to above half a knot let them allow a mile, and when under half a knot omit them, as fractions to be left, as many other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial things muſt be, to the judgment and induſtry of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigator, on which depends chiefly all comparative good rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings.</p>

as long as circumſtances will admit, becauſe the wind may vary to make a ſlant on the other tack, by which a ſhip may be got ſlanting forward on her way, then it may be worth while to carry a preſſing ſail if it blows freſh, and ſteer by the compaſs a little from the wind, as recommended in page 107, which may contribute greatly to ſhorten a paſſage.</p>

               <p>BY this method a ſhip may be kept with ſo much head-way upon her, as to be under the command of the helm, to ſteer her nearly to a courſe, ſix points from the wind, which ought by all means to be endeavoured after, to keep her bow (that bold and ſtrongeſt part) pointing to the waves, where they can do her the leaſt damage, and makes the ſhip at the ſame time much eaſier and livelier in the ſea, than being laid to as abovementioned. And theſe ſmall ſails are handy and ſtrong compared with the mainſail, being commonly made of equally ſtrong canvaſs, and proportionably leſs liable to be ſplit, either by the wind or waves, and can be ſet, or taken in eaſily with ſafety, and ſtand ſo flat, and fairly divided from the bowſprit end to the ſtern, that tend greatly to ſteady the ſhip, as well as eaſe all the maſts, yards, and rigging, from jerking and chafing in her rolling, and preſerve the mainſail and foreſail, the two moſt material ſails that are to be depended upon, on ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occaſion that may require their being ſet and carried upon a wind in bad weather.</p>

               <p>WHEN the waves run high, and ſudden neceſſity requires to bear away, it ſhould be conſidered that the low headſails which the ſhip may be wared under, when ſhe comes before the wind, may be becalmed by the height of the waves, which may break violently againſt the ſtern, and fill the deck with water, but that loftier ſails being ſet would give the ſhip more way through the water.</p>
               <p>I HAD an inſtance of this in a cruiſing ſhip under low ſails upon a wind in a ſtorm, when the ſhip and all things forward gave way ſo much, that obliged us to bear away before the wind, and the low ſails we had wared under were becalmed by the height of the waves when the ſhip was in the hollow part of the ſea, they came running againſt the ſtern with great violence and filled the deck with water, which frightend the people ſo, that ſeveral of them called out with tears in their eyes that the ſhip would founder: we got the cloſe reefed maintopſail ſet, which had the deſigned good effect to catch the wind, and always kept drawing full above the waves; this increaſed the ſhip's way ſo much, that the waves did not reach her with above half the velocity and power as before, and gave the ſhip time to riſe and fall gently with them without ſhipping much water, for the waves I ſuppoſe might run at the rate of about 20 miles an hour, the wind going at about 50, and the ſhip above 10 miles by the log, which naturally leſſened the power and violence of the waves above one half upon the ſhip; this proves the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and even the neceſſity there is for having a cloſe reefed main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topſail ready to ſet when going to ſcud before high waves.</p>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1112800100:137"/>
this I can ſay from experience, that it is not ſufficient that a ſhip can be got before the wind at the time of a heavy ſquall with a great deal of ſail ſet, which may endanger not only the maſts and ſails, but the ſhip may be ſo over preſſed with ſail as to put it out of the power of the helm and the beſt helmſman to ſteer her from broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, which may prove fatal to the whole.</p>
               <p>WHERE rules cannot be fixed, the reſult of facts from experience muſt be our only guide. I was in a ſhip in the Jamaica trade from London, where our commander would not permit any ſail to be ſhortened or taken in, without his order or conſent, when carrying a preſſing ſail large with a weſterly gale, at the coming on of a ſquall of wind he was called upon, and when he came upon deck he took the command and cunned the helmſman to endeavour to keep and ſteer the ſhip right before the wind without being obliged to ſhorten ſail, but the ſhip was ſo overpreſſed with ſail as to loſe the command of the helm to ſteer her, which almoſt proved fatal to us all.</p>
               <p>ALL unneceſſary dating risks of every kind, when there is no preſſing occaſion to require ſuch, ſhould be avoided and condemned as the greateſt folly, for there can be but little loſt, and a great deal may be ſaved, by lowering or taking in ſail in good time, when a ſhip is ſailing large or before the wind in the time of a ſquall, as ſails may be ſoon and eaſily ſet again when the ſquall is over, which may be the means to prevent great loſs or damage.</p>
               <p>AMONG many inſtances of this kind that I have known I met with one, by the foolhardineſs of a London pilot, who would not let our ſails be lowered, when ſailing before the wind in a ſquall, which made the maſts bend ſo much, that when we wanted to clew down the topgallant ſails and topſails, we could not get them down, which ſhews the neceſſity there is of clewing theſe ſails down, and ſecuring them down from flying up again before a ſquall comes on, for had this ſquall proved any ſtronger, or continued any longer, we muſt have loſt our maſts, in ſpite of our utmoſt endeavours.</p>
               <p>THIS ſhews the folly of running ſuch imprudent riſks, when little or no advantage can be gained by it, for it may be a diſputed point whether a ſhip ſails any faſter for being thus overpreſſed with ſail to ſuch a dangerous degree, when ſailing large or before the wind. But a ſhip ſailing upon a wind in ſqually weather, may often be under a neceſſity to carry a preſſing ſail, yet then it ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that if the topſails, &amp;c. are not clewed down in good time, that the heeling of the ſhip added to the bending of the maſts, may

               <p>THIS way of ſailing, in my opinion, deſerves particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe it is more expoſed to danger and damage than any other way of ſailing; for a ſhip upon a wind, in high waves, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

And the greater the ſhip, and the more water ſhe draws, the more liable ſhe is to damage, ſmaller veſſels give more way to the waves when ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I have been in a ſmall veſſel, in company with a fifty-gun ſhip that had her mainſail ſplit and other damage done by the waves breaking on board them, whilſt we received none in the ſmall veſſel. At another time croſſing the weſtern ocean in a light merchant ſhip with our guns, which were ſix pounders, ſtowed down in the hold upon the ballaſt, for the eaſe of the ſhip when ſailing this way, a ſtroke of a wave canted our ballaſt and guns from the weather to the lee ſide of the hold, and broke the ſtantions that ſupported the lower-deck beams: theſe and many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances

confirm my opinion of the great danger attending this way of ſailing.</p>
               <p>On cunning and ſteering a ſhip when ſailing in this way,<note place="margin">On luffing up to, or bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wave.</note> it may be diſputed whether ſhe ſhould be luffed up to, or bear away from a dangerous wave approaching upon the beam. Reaſon as well as experience teaches us that the helm ſhould be put hard a weather, to bring the approaching wave as far aft as poſſible, to leſſen its force, by the ſhip's running forward and giving the mere way from it, rather than to luff up with the helm a-lee to meet it with ſo much fail and head-way upon the ſhip, that muſt increaſe the ſtroke of the wave, and may produce a violent and dangerous pitching motion. I had an inſtance of this when I was mate of a ſhip, and it was my watch upon deck, when ſailing in this way, at the approach of a dangerous wave coming right upon the beam. I ordered the helm hard a weather, but my commander ordered the helm a-lee, which occaſioned the wave to have the abovementioned bad effect, tho' we received no material damage, yet, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it would have been leſs hazardous to have bore away with the helm a-weather.</p>
               <p>But to do juſtice on this occaſion, it muſt be allowed that ſhips in general commonly carry a preſſing ſail in this way, and are apt to gripe and carry the helm nearly hard a-weather, to ſteer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended courſe; ſo that without this is noticed and guarded againſt by the officer of the watch, by having only a ſuitable ſail ſet, and properly trimmed, it may be out of the power of the helm when hard a-weather, to make the ſhip ware faſt enough to avoid the bad effects of a dangerous wave when perceived to be coming upon the beam.</p>
               <p>After all that can be ſaid on this way of ſailing,<note place="margin">To avoid the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſail<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing in this way.</note> when the waves run high, I look upon the danger ſo great, that it ought to be avoided as much as poſſible, and it may be commendable to alter the courſe ſo as to ſteer with the wind and waves, either a point before, or abaft the beam, or for a time each way, if the occaſion required that nicety.</p>

               <p>GREAT caution is neceſſary on this occaſion, to prevent the damage that may be done by it, ſometimes even to pitching away the bowſptit, maſts, &amp;c. And as the waves in the open ſea, do not immediately ceaſe with the wind that raiſed them, but often continue to run the ſame way for a great while after the wind is changed, even to the oppoſite point of the compaſs, therefore when a ſudden change of wind happens, care ſhould be taken not to be too forward in ſetting or carrying ſail, ſo as to give the ſhip too much head-way againſt the old waves before they are fallen, for it may pitch the bowſprit under water, which I have ſeen done to a dangerous degree. Sometimes head-waves will riſe againſt and reach a ſhip a long time before the wind that raiſed them, which may make it equally dangerous to preſs the ſhip with too much ſail againſt them.</p>

               <head>On drawing near to Danger, or making a Landſail</head>
               <p>ON theſe occaſions, it ſhould be conſidered before-hand, what it moſt depends upon, to keep clear of the danger, or to make a good landfall; if they have regular ſoundings to it at a great diſtance, then the lead may be the ſureſt guide, but if it be ſteep to without ſoundings, then the latitude if it is known, and a good look out, with the ſhip properly prepared for it, as mentioned page 83, may contribute greatly towards ſafety.</p>
               <p>When going to croſs dangerous latitudes where projecting points of land or ſhoals may lie in the way, or in making ſmall iſlands, ſuch as Cape de Verd and Canary iſlands, it is certainly very wrong to run without much caution in the night, or in thick weather, with a erowd of ſail, on preſumption that the ſhip is far enough to the weſtward, to go clear of them, which has occaſioned many fatal loſſes, being deceived by the conſtant eaſterly current that runs in this track, which in my opinion is the principal cauſe that ſhips ſo often make more longitude out than they do home, in Weſt-India voyages, as before mentioned, page 110.</p>
               <p>It is the latitude only when known by obſervation, and not the longitude that can be depended upon for the ſhips being near, or clear of danger. I was in an Eaſt-India ſhip outward bound, the captain of which rather than run the riſk of croſſing the latitude of one of the Cape de Verd iſlands in the night, tack'd ſhip and ſtood back to the northward under an eaſy ſail till day light, when it plainly appeared that if we had continued our courſe to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we muſt have run upon the iſland before day-light.</p>
               <p>To make a good landfall, if the ſituation and circumſtances of wind and weather permit, that a ſhip can ſail with a leading wind true eaſt, or weſt, to the place of the deſigned landfall, it is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved method to get into that latitude in good time, and eſpecially homeward bound from the Weſtern ocean, and to endeavour by all poſſible means to get obſervations, to make proper allowance for the variation of the compaſs, leeway, bad ſteerage, currents, or tides, if known, to keep the ſhip as near as poſſible in this deſigned latitude. When got into the deſigned latitude, the uncertainty of the longitude makes the diſtance to be run as uncertain, therefore
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:1112800100:145"/>
in the day and clear weather, all the ſail that is poſſible with ſafety ſhould be carried, but in the night or thick weather, if it is thought prudent to run, it ſhould only be with ſuch ſails, as the officer and people on deck can look round them, and work the ſhip to avoid the danger in whatever manner it may appear.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding theſe rules and precautions in landfalls, I have experienced very narrow eſcapes, both in America, and on our own coaſt, where we are very liable to be deceived by the tides, and in cloudy weather, by taking one place for another. Among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances, it was my caſe in a ſhip from Leghorn to London, when in a cloudy afternoon we fell in with, and juſt got a glimpſe of the ſouth ſide of St. Mary's Scilly iſland, which by our reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and an account we had from an outer bound ſhip, we took it for, and concluded it to be the lizard point which we had ſeen. Therefore ordered, as I thought we might with confidence ſteer, a channel courſe for the night, but our miſtaken ſituation, tho' in a fair line of direction with our channel courſe, occaſioned the ebb tide that ſets N. W. between Scilly and the lands end, to take the ſhip on the ſtarboard bow, which ſheered us inſenſibly into the bottom of Mount's Bay: about midnight we were ſurpriſed with broken water and land extending as far as we could ſee on our ſtarboard bow, when carrying topgallant ſails with a freſh gale quartering at S. W. and large ſwelling waves from the main ocean right into the bay.</p>
               <p>The hurry we were in to exert our utmoſt endeavours at this cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical moment may be judged from our dangerous ſituation; we had our ſmall ſails to take in, and our topſails to get down, before we could bring the ſhip by the wind to lay her head from the neareſt breakers, and we had the main and foretopſails to cloſe roof, and the topgallant yards, &amp;c. to get down, when we had not room to ſtand above a quarter of an hour upon a tack clear of the breakers. This ſo alarmed ſome Engliſh paſſengers (and even one of them who had been brought up to ſea) that they all aſſembled in the great cabin to prayers, which they thought was their only refuge for ſafety; but putting the ſhip in ſtays which ſhe refuſed, and then wating her round,<note place="margin">On turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Mount's Bay, and our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement in box hauling.</note> by box hauling, as repreſented in the two figures, plate the 7th, frightened them from prayer, and they all came upon deck thinking we were running the ſhip on ſhore. We thus managed her by box hauling, as ſoon as we perceived the ſhip ceaſed from coming about in ſtays, we hauled the fore ſheet
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1112800100:146"/>
cloſe aft again, trimmed the head-ſails flat whilſt the ſails were ſhaking, and hauled about the main and main top ſail the ſame as if the ſhip had ſtayed, hauled up the mizen and kept the helm hard a lee, as repreſented by figure 2 in the ſame plate, by which the ſhip getting great ſtern-way turned ſhort round upon her heel, till ſhe filled the main and main top ſails the right way, we then ſhifted the helm hard a-weather, when the ſhip got head way with the ſails trimm'd, as repreſented by figure 1, which brought her readily round, with little loſs of ground, by theſe means in about twelve hours we turned to windward ſo far off the lee ſhore, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented at figure 3, ſo as to weather the lizard, where, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch dangers at this place as we narrowly eſcaped, they have ſince erected light houſes, for which they have my thanks, and in my opinion deſerve the thanks of the public. The like public thanks will be due to whoever may be inſtrumental in getting a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhable light or lights on <hi>Holyhead,</hi> to prevent as much as poſſible ſuch fatal loſſes as have often happened in <hi>Carnarvon</hi> bay, occaſioned principally by the ebb tide taking ſhips on the larboard bow, in St. <hi>George</hi>'s channel, when ſteering from <hi>Tuſker</hi> for <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> which ſheers them inſenſibly into <hi>Carnarvon</hi> bay if the tide is not properly allowed for as beforementioned.</p>
               <p>THAT a ſhip ſailing againſt a tide or current,<note place="margin">Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſtrong tide chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels.</note> which takes her on either bow, is the cauſe that alters her courſe, muſt be evident to every one who knows that when a ſhip is ſailing with a leading wind in a narrow river or channel againſt a ſtrong tide or current, it requires nice ſteerage right againſt the ſtream to keep her in a fair way, for if the ſtream is let to take her on the ſtarboard bow, ſhe will ſoon ſheer upon the larboard ſhore, if on the larboard bow upon the ſtarboard ſhore, &amp;c. ſo that the ſame cauſe will have the ſame effect in all narrow ſeas, or channels in proportion to their breadth. Where the tide or current runs ſtrong, it may be highly neceſſary in the night or thick weather, to endeavour to ſteer right againſt the ſtream whilſt it runs againſt the ſhip, as circumſtances may require, to keep the ſhip in mid channel, or in a fair way till day-light, or until the weather is ſo clear as to permit to ſee the danger at a ſufficient diſtance to run a-croſs the ſtream boldly for the land to know the ſhip's real ſituation, which may be a means to avoid ſuch dangers as abovementioned, and to proceed forward with more ſafety. Proceeding in this cautious manner, is eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally neceſſary in St. <hi>George</hi>'s channel, where the tides run ſo ſtrong, that when a ſhip happens to enter it, at the firſt part of either flood
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1112800100:147"/>
or ebb, if the land cannot be ſeen clear enough to make proper remarks, the tide may make vaſt alteration in the intended diſtance to be run,<note place="margin">Not to miſtake the land.</note> as well as in the courſe, by which people's judgment is apt to be miſled, and they take one place for another, which has occaſioned great loſs and damage to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE after a night's run in St. <hi>George</hi>'s channel, if the land you happen to fall in with appears dubious, to avoid any bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence that may attend a miſtake, no pains ſhould be ſpared to get a certain knowledge of it; at the clearing up of a fog, I have been obliged to ſend a boat on ſhore to enquire what land it was that we found ourſelves ſo near to, and which ſurprized us after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to find it was a part of the <hi>Iſle of Man,</hi> and we ſhould not have known it without this trouble, ſuch great alteration does the different ſtate of the atmoſphere ſometimes make in the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of land.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſuppoſe a ſhip arrived ſafe to where ſhe is obliged to take in a pilot, if he is to be boarded from a ſloop, ſchooner, or hoy rigged veſſel, under ſail at ſea, in bad weather it may be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and is often attended with damage, if not properly manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore it deſerves notice.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>On getting a Pilot on Board in bad Weather at Sea.</head>
               <p>THIS is ſometimes attended with ſo much danger, that the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot ſloops belonging to <hi>Leverpool,</hi> rather than run the riſk of boarding a ſhip from their own ſloop, ſometimes go no nearer to the ſhip than to have a ſmall rope thrown to or veered a-ſtern to them, which they make faſt about the pilot's body under his arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, he then goes overboard into the ſea when as near the ſhip as they dare venture, and he is hauled on board the ſhip by the rope.</p>
               <p>IT is a bad and common practice, in many ſhips, when the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot veſſel has got near them, to lay the ſhip to, with the helm a-lee, and to let her drive with the main or fore-top-ſail a-back, thinking they may be boarded by the pilot's veſſel without danger. But no ſenſible pilot, that knows what would be the conſequence, will offer to board at ſuch time, whilſt the ſhip lies to. But if an unexperienced pilot boards a ſhip upon the weather quarter, which ſeems much the beſt for the purpoſe, the ſhip then heelding to lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1112800100:148"/>
keeps the yards, maſts and rigging clear from getting entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled. Yet it is well known from experience, that it is more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to board to windward than to leeward, and that a ſtroke by a wave from a ſmall veſſel againſt a large one, will do much more damage, than a ſtroke by a large veſſel againſt a ſmall one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the large veſſel reſiſts and does not give way to the blow of the ſmall one, which would yield and give way to a ſtroke from the large one, in proportion to the difference of their weight, for which reaſon a ſhip ſhould always be boarded on the lee ſide, but to do it whilſt ſhe lies to is attended with too much danger to riſk, when the ſhip has any motion from the waves, for the helm being a lee the ſhip may get ſternway, and fall round off from the wind, whilſt the pilot's veſſel is boarding, which may occaſion great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and for want of a ſtern rope I have known rowing boats, when boarding get athwart the hauſe and ſink at ſuch times.</p>
               <p>THE beſt method for this purpoſe in my opinion is, when the pilot veſſel is got near, but ſtill far enough to windward; for the ſhip to ſail right forward about a point from the wind, with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-yards braced ſharp up, the main yard a-back out of the way, and ſail enough, eſpecially ſtay ſails, to keep good head way up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſhip, the more the better ſo that ſhe has only a little leſs way than the pilot veſſel, which may ſhoot up under the ſhip's lee quarter, where a ſtern rope, and one paſſed aft from forward ſhould be ready and thrown them, by which they may tow and ſteer their veſſel clear from damage under the lee quarter, ſheltered by the ſhip from the waves, and may watch for a ſmooth ſea, and ſheer to the ſhip at pleaſure to board the pilot, and ſheer clear again with the leaſt riſk poſſible.</p>

               <head>On PILOTS.</head>
               <p>A Pilot's qualifications ſhould as much as poſſible be every way equal to the dangers and difficulties that attend his naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhould know where the ſhoals extend to a great diſtance, and where the channels are narrow, intricate, and ſhallow, where and when expoſed to dangerous waves, where life as well as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty being at riſk. None ſhould be admitted to take upon them this important charge, but ſuch as from experience and practice,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1112800100:149"/>
can give a ready verbal account of the courſe and diſtance from one place to another, the flowing and ſetting of the tides, depth of water, land marks, buoys, beacons, lights, &amp;c. And ſhould not only be ſeaman enough to work and manage a ſhip to the beſt advantage in fine weather, but capable when in difficult ſituations to form a right judgment what is beſt to be done for ſafety, and what can reaſonably be expected for the people and the ſhip to do on every occaſion.</p>
               <p>THE beſt and moſt dexterous pilots for working and managing ſhips in crowded, narrow, or dangerous channels are thoſe at <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> haven, who from much practice by having many large collier ſhips to pilot in and out, as mentioned page 93, are more expert than any other people that I have ſeen, and they take remarkable pains to get the ſhip ſteered to their mind, they look out ſharp, and cun the helms-man loud and quick, and make him anſwer and move the helm as the occaſion may require, to counteract as much as poſſible the motion of the waves that may make the ſhip devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate either way from her intended tract. And when they turn to windward into the harbour, they likewiſe obſerve with great atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cun quick to keep the ſhip fairly full and by the wind, with good way upon her, under the command of the helm to make her work the better, and when they come to, where there is not room to turn to windward they take care to lay her head the right way, brail up the courſes and drive to windward with the tide, where they have only little more room than the ſhip's length.</p>
               <p>BUT when or where a pilot is found defective in ſeamanſhip, or capacity to judge and act with ſkill and prudence, on difficult or dangerous occaſions, it is certainly the duty of the commander and proper officers to be upon their guard, and not to give up their judgment and themſelves implicitly to a pilot, of whoſe conduct they have no aſſurance, which has to my knowledge occaſioned great damage and fatal loſſes.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE when a pilot's capacity is not known, his behaviour in management and deſign of proceeding ſhould be noticed, and treated with more or leſs confidence as his conduct ſeems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and when it plainly appears that his conduct cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon, then ſelf preſervation, the firſt law of nature, makes it a caſe of neceſſity and point of duty for the commander to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with the pilot, and truſt to his conduct no farther than is
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1112800100:150"/>
conſiſtent with ſafety. And not to be afraid of that falſe common notion, that if a commander of a ſhip interferes in the pilot's duty, he makes himſelf anſwerable for the conſequence to the enſurers, but it is quite otherwiſe, for the enſurers enſure the commander's conduct, therefore inſtead of being blamed by the enſurers, he certainly deſerves their thanks for endeavouring to prevent loſs or damage that is likely to be the conſequence of a thoughtleſs blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering pilot that has fallen to his lot, which has been my caſe when we had a very narrow eſcape.</p>
               <p>BUT pilots, like other ranks of men, muſt be allowed to have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent capacities and diſpoſitions, and according to their practice muſt be more or leſs capable of their duty, conſequently among the many there muſt be a variety of good, bad, and indifferent, yet the reſpectable character of a pilot on the whole, entitles them to be treated with all the reſpect and encouragement their uſefulneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, ſo that when a pilot proves deficient in his duty, and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not to be had, to make the moſt of him, it is certainly beſt to endeavour by all poſſible means to help and adviſe him with candour what may be thought beſt to be done according to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and if his ſpirits appear to fail him in a dangerous paſſage or ſituation, and no remedy leſt but to go forward, he ſhould then be cheered and encouraged to keep up his heart, and not to let fear nor intoxication with liquor, get the better of him, which may be of equal bad conſequence</p>
               <p>BUT the moſt danger is from thoſe inconſiderate and unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced pilots, who think a ſhip may be managed and conducted with equal eaſe and ſafety among ſhoals, as their own ſmall veſſels to which they have been accuſtomed, therefore they think there is no occaſion to wait for the tide, the day-light, or clear weather but to puſh forward at all hazard, though it may be ſuch weather that no lights, marks, buoys, beacons, nor the dangerous ſhoals in the way can be ſeen, nor guarded againſt by a compaſs courſe, nor by the lead, at a ſufficient diſtance to keep clear of them.</p>
               <p>I HAD the experience of a pilot of this ſort, who wanted to run in the night amongſt the ſhoals, when nothing could be ſeen for a guide to keep clear of them, therefore I oppoſed him till day-light, when it blew freſh right upon the ſhore, with drizzling hazy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that we could not ſee a mile before us, he preſſed me very hard to bear away and ſet ſail, I reaſoned with him of the danger, and would not conſent till we had a conſultation of the officers,

when he was told of the great riſk there was in running upon a lee ſhore in ſuch bad weather, that if we fell in at any great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from a fair way, he was to conſider that the ſhip was not to be worked and managed in little room among ſhoals, like the ſmall veſſel we had taken him from, &amp;c. he anſwered that the greateſt danger was from our not running to get into ſafety when we might, and that his life was as dear to him, having a family depending upon it, as any of ours could be to us, and that if he could but ſee any part of the land, or even the breakers he could ſteer in by them, to get into ſafety.</p>
               <p>BY the pilot's perſuaſion we bore away for our port, but with all the neceſſary precaution poſſible, to guard againſt the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended dangers above-mentioned; we run before the wind under cloſe reefed main and foretop ſails, thinking we ſhould be obliged to carry them by the wind, if occaſion required to make the ſhip work, or to keep clear of the lee ſhore, the lower ſails in the brails ready to ſet on either tack by the wind, the anchors and cables all clear, all hands at their ſtations looking ſharp out, and the deep ſea lead going; in 15 fathom water, we ſaw land and ſhoal broken water near a-head, which was ſhewn to the pilot, aſking him which way we ſhould go now, he pointed from the danger we were near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to, but looking the way he pointed, nothing could be ſeen but broken raging waves, we aſked him what was then to be done, being in five fathom water, I perceived he was overcome with fear, and had nothing to ſay, but left us to ſave ourſelves as we could; we then brought the ſhip round to by the wind, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we were well mann'd, was obliged to get the main and fore ſheets aft with the tacks, not above two thirds down, by which, under Providence, and the ſhip's faſt ſailing, we but juſt cleared the breakers on the lee-ſhore, which would by all appearance have proved our total deſtruction, if the ſhip had been left to the conduct of the pilot, who after this, as it is common with all ſuch unthinking men, went from a raſh confidence to ſuch extreme fearfulneſs, that he thought we could not poſſibly get far enough from the danger we had ſo narrowly eſcaped; when the weather cleared up with a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den change, and a gail of wind right off ſhore, that put us under reef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courſes, we could but juſt ſee the land from the maſt head.</p>
               <p>THIS pilot's conduct, and the many inſtances of damage, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal loſſes, that have been occaſioned by raſh, imprudent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective pilots, prove the neceſſity that a commander may be often
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1112800100:152"/>
under to interfere with the pilot, but it ſhould always be done in a calm friendly manner to adviſe or aſſiſt him in whatever he may ſeem deficient, for it is but natural to ſuppoſe that a commander ſhould know the trim and properties of his ſhip from experience, and what dependence may be put on her for ſailing, ſteering, ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, waring, or to ride at an anchor, and how they can work and manage her on extraordinary occaſions, in narrow and dangerous channels, and ſhould form a better judgment what the ſhip and crew can do, than a ſtrange pilot who may be a brave man, and know his way very well, yet, for want of experience, may be much inferior to the commander in working and managing the ſhip, and when this is the caſe, it ſhould be agreed for the pilot to ſhew the way and point out the dangers, whilſt the commander works and manages the ſhip to keep clear of them, which in my opinion may often contribute greatly to prevent misfortunes. But when pilots are known to be thoroughly qualified to work and manage a ſhip as their navigation requires, then the commander has only to ſee that the pilot's orders are obeyed.</p>
               <p>BUT when ſhips are going for ſhoal flats, bar or tide harbour, where ſafety depends upon the height and time of tide which makes all hints or remarks from obſervations on the tides deſerve notice, therefore, ſailor like, I venture to give ſome obſervations upon them.</p>

               <p>THE tides, and the knowledge of them, are of ſuch great and important advantages to our navigation, and eſpecially among our many ſhoals, flatts, bar and tide harbours, where it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends entirely upon the certainty of the flow and time of the tide to proceed with ſafety. Therefore our utmoſt endeavours ſhould be uſed to get the greateſt knowledge of the tides that is poſſible in all our tide and bar harbours that lie near the ſea, by obſerving and remarking the time, and how much they flow on an average, not only at full and change, but at the quarters of the moon, which is the time that the tides are at their greateſt deviation, from the mean and common way of reckoning them, which, if it was made public, might contribute greatly to come at a more perfect theory of the tides, as well as prevent the loſs and damage that may be

occaſioned by ſhips running for our ſhoal water harbours at a wrong time of tide, being deceived by the old common method of reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tides, which is very erroneous, eſpecially at the quarters of the moon, and marking the time of flowing at full and change al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to a point of the compaſs, adds to the uncertainty of a ſhip from ſea to find the time of high water, which from experience I can ſay has occaſioned great loſs and damage.<note place="margin">Damage done by running at a wrong time of tide.</note> I was in a Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia ſhip running for a bar harbour in <hi>Ireland</hi> by this erroneous rule, when we beat off our gripe, rudder, and a great deal of the ſtern poſt, and after part of the keel upon the bar, and had ſeven feet water in the hold when we got into the harbour, and was obliged to run on ſhore to prevent ſinking. At <hi>Leverpool</hi> I have obſerved ſhips coming in at neap tides about the quarters of the moon, when inſtead of meeting with high water, as expected by the common way of reckoning, they have found it about a quarter ebb, that for want of water enough they have often ſtruck or come a-ground and laid upon the bar, when loſs or great damage has often been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
               <p>FOR theſe reaſons, and being requeſted by my friend Mr. <hi>Fergu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> the aſtronomer, who with great labour and pains furniſhed me with large ſchemes, tables, plans, &amp;c. relating to the tides in the year 1764, when I began, and have continued to make obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the time and height of the tides flowing at the old dock gates in <hi>Leverpool,</hi> which is about three miles from the mouth of the river, that is ſo broad and extenſive, that as a branch of the ſea no land floods or freſhes has any effect on the tides in the river oppoſite to the town, where the leaſt flow of water that I have obſerved in neap tides, was nine feet at the dock gates when low water was juſt even with the ſill of the gates, from whence is marks in the ſtone work upward to twenty-two feet and a half, from which the heights of the tides are taken, but having no marks below the ſill of the gates towards the river, where from obſervations made on the whole riſe of ſome tides, I have reaſon to conclude in moderate weather, that in proportion as the tides commonly riſe above the nine feet mark at the gates, they fall the ſame below the ſill of the gates, and that the four feet and a half mark is near the half flood mark let the riſe be what it will, though it does not agree with half the time of flowing nor ebbing of the tides.</p>
               <p>BUT to obſerve more exactly the whole riſe of one of our mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling tides, I had a board fixed upright at low water in the river,

marked with ſix inch marks each foot, high enough to obſerve by,<note place="margin">A mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling tide nicely ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerved.</note> till the tide reached the dock gates, and remarked the time it flowed to each foot the riſe of the whole tide, which was twenty-two feet and an half, from ſeven feet below the dock gates to the fifteen feet and an half mark at the gates in five hours fifty minutes, the firſt half tide roſe in two hours forty minutes, but the next to high water was three hours ten minutes, ſo that the firſt half tide roſe in fifteen minutes leſs time than the laſt, and it fell again to the half flood mark about fifteen minutes leſs time than it was in riſing. But the ſlack tide at low and high water muſt be allowed to account for part of theſe irregularities, it ebbed the tide before, as I judge it does moſt commonly in moderate weather ſix hours thirty minutes, added to the flood five hours fifty minutes, makes twelve hours twenty minutes, the twenty minutes difference in time between theſe two high waters, agree with a tide table that is calculated and publiſhed here yearly by Meſſrs. <hi>Holdens,</hi> the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of which to be mentioned hereafter.</p>

               <p>THE old method of reckoning the tides by mean or equal dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of time, or the bearing of the moon by the compaſs,<note place="margin">The tides flowing compared with a tide clock.</note> from full to change has been found very defective.

               <p>As we move round the ſun, and the moon round us in eleptical orbits, and the moon's motion is faſter or ſlower as ſhe is nearer or farther from us, which is reckoned to be about 34,000 miles near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to us when in her perigee, than when in her apogee, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days and a half in going from one to the other, that makes the high and low tides conſtantly vary accordingly, and which ſeems to me to make about a ſixth part difference in the height of the tides from whatever they may flow in common, which I reckon about twenty-eight feet to be the whole flow of our common ſpring tides when we have about eighteen feet at the above-mentioned dock gates, but when the moon happens to be in her perigee at full or change, then we have about twenty-one feet at the gates, and when this happens at the quarters of the moon inſtead of 12 feet, as in common at neap tides, we have about fourteen feet at the gates. And when this happens at equal night ſpring tides, we have about twenty-two feet at the gates, and the neap tides low in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion if the moon happens to be in her apogee. And what is very remarkable,<note place="margin">When the day and night tides run higheſt.</note> that from about the tenth of <hi>May</hi> to the tenth of <hi>November</hi> the night tides that flow from ſix in the evening to ſix in the morning run the higheſt; and from the tenth of <hi>November</hi> to about the tenth of <hi>May,</hi> the day tides run the higheſt, and this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference often amounts to eighteen inches.</p>

                     <p>INDEED no perſon can expect that it ſhould be otherwiſe, who conſiders that <hi>Monſieur de la Caille</hi>'s, and all other Methods (except that of <hi>Monſieur Caſſini,</hi> which in truth is no better depend entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the moon's age, or her diſtance from the ſun; without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the different diſtances of either the ſun or moon from the earth, their declinations, the latitudes of places, or any thing elſe that affects the tides.</p>
                     <p>THUS deficient are all former methods in computing only the times of high water; as for the heights, the calculation thereof has never before been attempted by any one, that I know of; though they are, as I apprehend, equally neceſſary; for of what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage can it be to the ſeaman, to know when the tide will be at the higheſt, if there will not be, at that time, depth of water ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for his purpoſe? Indeed it would be of no more ſervice to know that there would be depth enough of water, unleſs he knew at the ſame time, when to expect it. But to know what height the tide will riſe to, and at what time, muſt contribute greatly to his ſecurity: and is it not abſolutely requiſite, that a tide table ſhould inform him of both theſe?</p>
                     <p>IF any perſon ſhall think proper to compare this table with his own obſervations, he ought always to ſet his watch right immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before, by ſome good ſun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dial; for theſe calculations are made according to ſolar time.</p>

               <p>SO that theſe tide tables muſt certainly be of great utility to all that are concerned in the time and height of the tides flowing, and from their height may judge of their velocity, which I reckon op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the town is at the rate of about a mile an hour for every fathom it flows up and down, and that is about two and a half at common neap, and about four and a half at common ſpring tides; and there is ſeven feet more water on the bar of the common chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, than at the old dock gates, ſo that by the tide table, it may be judged when a ſhip will have water enough to get into the river, and into the docks with ſafety. And how to birth them according to their drafts of water not only in the wet docks, but in the graving or repairing docks, which are of different depths, that they may have water enough to get out as well as in. And they are thought to be of that importance to our pilots, that the laws for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating the pilots make it a penalty of five pounds for a pilot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without a tide table, and a watch kept to ſolar time.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE I hope theſe tide tables will meet with all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement that the ingenuity and labour deſerves to continue their publication,<note place="margin">The moon's diſtance to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to for the height and ſtrength of the tides.</note> till time gives them a fair trial how near their theory agrees, with other ſhoal dangerous ports or places, that depends upon knowing the certainty of the time, and height of the tides flowing to proceed with ſafety, which may be a means to recommend ſuch tide tables to be tried and uſed in proportion to the advantages that may be experienced from them. But till time brings this about, the only method to judge when the tides will be higher or lower than common is to attend to the moon's diſtance, being near her perigee or apogee as before-mentioned) which are remarked in the nautical or <hi>White</hi>'s almanacks, and ſhould be in all our navigation books, where the flowing of the tides are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked; and to make an allowance, as a ſtorm of wind happens

I cannot perceive, as has been imagined, that the tides are affected when our neighbouring worlds are paſſing near us in the ſame ſide of our orbits, as mentioned in page 88, or by the different weight of our atmoſphere, as ſhewn by the barometer. And as I live fronting and but fourteen yards from the dock gates abovementioned, which opens with the flood and ſhuts at high water, whilſt I am able and willing would be glad of any directions, rules, or hints, that might improve obſervations on the tides, to make them more uſeful to ſeamen, pilots, mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians, aſtronomers, or philoſophers.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Lamps &amp; reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors how made and fixed.</note>THESE lamps and reflectors, as repreſented in plate 10, fig. 1 and 2, are fixed in the light room, right fronting the channel or line of direction for a fair way, and oppoſite the middle of the window, which ſhould be high enough in proportion to the reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and extend in width each way as far as neceſſary the light can, or may require to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>THESE reflectors are made as near as they can be to the parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic curve by drawing a ſet of parallel lines right acroſs the focus or center line; and mark the focal diſtance above the parallel lines, and take an extent from the focal diſtance, to each parallel line one after the other, with theſe extents mark each parallel line in its turn from the focus or burning point with dots on each ſide of the focus line, to the extent of the deſigned diameter, and making a regular ſweep from dot to dot, as repreſented in plate 10, fig. 3, by which method a form may be made, for the curve of a parabolic reflector of any focus or diameter, to have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, when the ſun's, or any other rays of light or fire comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in parallel lines they are reflected to, and croſs each other at the focus, which makes the focus the burning point; and juſt the contrary effect, when a burning blaze of fire or light is fixed in their focus all the rays of light that falls upon them are reflected right forward in parallel lines, with more or leſs power in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the luſtre or brightneſs of the reflectors, which are illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated ſo as to look like a blaze as big as the reflectors themſelves, to people in that quarter nearly facing them by the angle of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being equal to the angle of incident.</p>
               <p>WE have made and had in uſe here at <hi>Liverpool,</hi> reflectors of one, two, and three feet focus, and three, five and a half, ſeven
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1112800100:164"/>
and a half, and twelve feet diameter, the three ſmalleſt made of tin plates ſodered together, and the largeſt of wood, covered with plates of looking glaſs, ſhaped as repreſented by fig. one and two, plate 10, and fixed as near as can be to the above-mentioned rules, and a copper lamp, the ciſtern part for the oil and wick ſtands behind the reflectors, ſo that nothing ſtands before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flector to intercept the blaze from acting upon it, but the tube that goes through it, with a ſpreading burning mouth-piece, to ſpread the blaze of the lamp parallel to, and with the middle of it, juſt in the focus or burning point of the reflector, as may be ſeen by the figures above-mentioned.</p>
               <p>WE have a feeding can with oil to ſtand upon the ciſtern of each lamp, with a ſmall braſs cock that is turned to drop or run a little according to the conſumption of oil, that it may be kept near to the level of the mouth of the lamp, near which is a little rim to prevent any drains of oil along the tube to the reflector (as may be ſeen in fig. 2.) which drops from the rim, to a dripping-pan that ſtands below the reflector, and if the cock of the feeding can ſhould be turned to run too faſt, to prevent an over-flow of oil there is a ſmall hole and a tube in the ciſtern that lets the oil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a tin can ſtanding below it. The lamps like the reflectors are proportional in their bigneſs to make a greater or leſs blaze as their diſtance to be ſeen requires, their ſpreading burning parts are from three to twelve, and fourteen inches, which makes the blaze the ſame breadth, and burns higher or lower, according to the quality of the oil, on which the goodneſs of the lights greatly depends. And as the wick is common cotton thread, ſpun for the purpoſe of lamps, and wound in lengths to fill the mouth of the lamps about a quarter of an inch thick, and as it conſumes there is long mouth pincers, the lengths as above, to haul out the wick altogether through the tubes, as the occaſion requires, and are ſnuffed with a pair of ſheers in one hand, and a tin box with a little water in it in the other, for the ſnuffings, to prevent the danger of fire, and is only required to be attended and trimm'd by their keepers eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry four hours.</p>
               <p>THUS are theſe Light-houſes conſtructed, kept, and ſituated as above-mentioned, and has ſtood the teſt of fair trial, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and advantages given to them, even by their oppoſers, as there always will be to new things, commonly calling them new whims, till time and trial confirm them uſeful improvements, which
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1112800100:165"/>
theſe are allowed to be by all that have ſeen them, for in a dark clear night the two ſea lights (notwithſtanding their height, and the curvature or roundneſs of the ſea, as before mentioned) may be plainly ſeen when they are in a line with the horizon, not only from the deck, but from the maſt head of a ſhip, which gives the advantage to ſee which way they are open, to bring them in a line in good time, either to keep the ſhip off, or run in by them in a fair way, as the circumſtance of the time and tide prudently conſidered may require.</p>
               <p>BUT it may be ſaid that theſe reflecting lights only ſuit ſuch places as require them to be ſeen only from one quarter of the compaſs, which muſt be acknowledged, though two of our lamps give a blaze twelve and fourteen inches ſquare, yet there is but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reflected light above three points of the compaſs each way, but then it muſt be allowed that the blaze of the lamps can be ſeen as in common with other lights above half the compaſs clear of the edge of the reflectors, which illuminate greatly the atmoſphere fronting them, that adds greatly to the light even in that ſituation.</p>

               <p>BUT where a light-houſe requires to be ſeen equally from all quarters quite round the compaſs, and lighted with a number of candles, or common lamps, as it is known from experience, that their rays of light paſs and croſs each other freely in all directions, without any viſible interruption, which makes it a diſputed point, whether reflectors would be of any ſervice; which in my opinion a number of thoſe hand lamps with their reflectors ſet round upon ſhelves near the windows as above-mentioned, would reflect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rays of light in an horizontal direction clear of the ſmoke, that would fall above and below the windows, and throw more light
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1112800100:166"/>
through the windows, with, than without the reflectors, from an equal quantity of lights, but the advantage that would be gained wants to be confirmed by experiment.</p>
               <p>THESE hand lamps and reflectors were contrived to make night ſignals by lights,<note place="margin">Signals for ſhips ſeen off, and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.</note> to be ſet in the ſtair caſe windows of our upper ſea light-houſe, that fronts towards the town, in caſe of any veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel being perceived in diſtreſs in the night, or when it is too dark to ſee the day ſignals, which are repreſented with the light-houſe, fig. 6, plate 10, as they were publiſhed upon a chard to make them known; and as they have given general ſatisfaction ſince they have been in uſe, and afford a greater number and variety of different veſſels than any other ſet of ſignals I have ſeen I thought deſerved this notice. Beſides theſe public ſignals, ſeveral mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants have flag-ſtaffs erected at a little diſtance from the light-houſe, that when their ſhips appear with their particular ſignal their colours are hoiſted on their flagſtaff for their information.</p>
               <p>IT is further propoſed to have at this light-houſe, a ſet of gun chambers charged with a compoſition of fire balls next the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then filled with ſaw-duſt, and a ſur plug drove hard in with a wooden mall, that when any veſſel is perceived to make ſignals of diſtreſs for help, either by day or night, they are to be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by firing one of theſe chambers, which ſtands with its breech upon the ground, that prevents any recoil, therefore diſcharges its contents right up in the air with a loud exploſion, which will not only alarm the town to ſend help, but the fire ball ſparkling in the air will give the diſtreſſed a great ſatisfaction to ſee that their ſignals are noticed to expect help. The ſituation of this light-houſe is well adapted to anſwer all theſe purpoſes, ſtanding fronting the town and docks at three miles diſtance upon a ſtone hill about for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yards high above the level of the ſea at high water, which makes it very conſpicuous, both from the town and at ſea, it being the firſt object that appears on ſhore above the horizon, in a fair direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for its channel as may be ſeen by the chart.</p>
               <p>BUT to return to the hand lamps and reflectors, as before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I tried one of them with our reflectors of three feet diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and one foot focus, made and glaſſed as repreſented in fig 1, 2, but it proved greatly inferior, though it might be ſeen at nine or ten miles diſtance, and in trying them with a common ſhop lamp with equal wicks, and ſet in different windows of the ſtair caſe of the light-houſe that faces the town as above-mentioned, when the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1112800100:167"/>
reflected lamp eclipſed the common lamp to ſuch a degree that I could not ſee it without uſing a ſpy glaſs at three miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and theſe ſmall reflectors being only beat out of common tin, that if they were improved and made of blown quick-ſilvered glaſs, ſilver plated copper, or reflecting teleſcope metal as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave mirrors, and ſodered all together with the lamp in a tin pan like a dripping pan, as repreſented in fig. 4 and 5, only with the addition of tin ſtays behind the reflectors to keep altogether in handling them about, it is a doubt with me, whether a number ſet as before mentioned, would not be preferable to our large reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, for I have perceived from experience, that our large reflectors of one foot focus, and three feet diameter, reflects a ſtronger light in proportion than our large reflector of twelve feet diameter and three feet focus.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER great benefit I thought might ariſe from theſe hand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flectors if they were brought to perfection, ſingle light houſes might be diſtinguiſhed from one another by having different numbers of windows luminated by them, but in trying experiments with two of them, ſet in the firſt and ſecond ſtair-caſe windows of the light-houſe already mentioned,<note place="margin">Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>SAFETY, as well as ſucceſs, in my opinion, depends greatly on the manner theſe ſhips are fitted out.

               <p>AS to the ſize and number of great guns, the dimenſions, ſtrength, and properties of the ſhip, as mentioned in pages 25, 26, 27, &amp;c. ſhould point out what ſhe will be able to bear without being too crank for a ſailing and a fighting ſhip, though it muſt be allowed that the advantages in a ſea fight are greatly in favour of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt ſhot, but the many ſtorms a ſhip may have to contend with, in a winter's paſſage, or cruiſe in a turbulent ocean, where the great guns may be often rendered a uſeleſs and dangerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance, by the waves running ſo high, that nothing but ſmall arms can be uſed againſt the enemy, for which reaſons a ſhip ſhould not be over-crowded, or over-burdened with too heavy cannon.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Short and light guns recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</note>OUR late improvement, in the metal, caſting, and boring of iron cannon, makes me recommend that they may be made ſhort, and as light of metal as poſſible to bear a ſufficient proof, which not only gives proportional ſafety and eaſe to a ſhip, in the times above-mentioned, but are managed and fought with greater ſafety, eaſe, and expedition, and will do ſufficient execution at the ſmall diſtance; the bravery of our people makes it neceſſary to fight our ſhips to the greateſt advantage.

               <p>GREAT guns, mounted on theſe carriages to be ready at ſea in time of war, are commonly carried either run out of the ports, or kept houſed with their muzzles againſt the ſhip's ſide at the upper parts of the ports, as repreſented by one in letter D, plate 9, but is much more maſterly delineated in <hi>Falconer</hi>'s famous Marine Dictionary (which came out a good while after my plates were ſtruck off) in his 7th plate the guns are repreſented, both run out, and ſtowed as laſt mentioned, fig. 19, with the muzzle againſt the ſide of the ſhip above the port, and he very judiciouſly remarks, at the ſecuring the guns, to hook the takles ſo that a ſecond breeching may be added, laſhed and bowſed as tight as poſſible, to prevent the guns from breaking looſe, which may be productive of dangerous conſequences: and this by report has ſo often happened in our Royal Navy, that it was conjectured, that the Victory, a firſt rate ſhip of war, was loſt by it.

               <p>I OWN on this occaſion to ſpeak principally from the experience of only one ſhip that had only been three voyages to the Eaſt Indies, when ſhe was fitted out firſt to cruiſe three months off the Weſtern Iſlands, we carried thirty-two guns, and eight of them 12 pounders on the lower deck, houſed as laſt mentioned, with their muzzles againſt the ſhip's ſide above the ports, which, when the waves ran high, did ſo work the ſhip, and the ſhip them with all their tackle about them, to ſuch dangerous degrees, that for the ſafety of the whole, we were obliged at different times to put theſe guns down the hold, and leave our ſtations, to run for ſafety to a port to get our leaks ſtopped.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING this method is general, in all large ſhips of war that carries lower deck guns, yet I appeal to reaſon, and all who have obſerved, or conſidered, what occaſions theſe guns to

And when the ſituation of the enemy requires the guns pointed as much forward or aft as the ports will allow, as repreſented by the two guns on the different carriages, figure C, plate 9, it may be perceived that the ſole of the ſwivel carriage ſtands in a direction right in and out, that when the gun is fired it recoils right back oppoſite to the port, ready and eaſily run <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:1112800100:180"/>BUT it muſt be acknowledged that theſe ſwivel carriages require a little extraordinary trouble to keep the upper part of the ſoles clean, and greaſed a little at times, to make the guns ſwivel eaſy upon them. And as it is common to hear objections againſt new things, the only one I heard againſt theſe, that they would not ſtand a long and conteſted fight, which I own we had not the trial of, having learned from experience, that to make the conteſt ſhort in our favour, was to get ſo near the enemy that our people could not well miſs their object. And as the takles and breechings are all upon the carriage part, I could not perceive, from all my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that they would not bear as long firing as the common car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, for the centre bolt, &amp;c. has nothing to move but the weight of the ſole. After this I was induced to think this carriage wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the notice of the managers of our Royal Navy, therefore I got a nice model with a gilt gun, &amp;c. made, and a friend to preſent it to Lord <hi>Anſon,</hi> then at the head of the admiral<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IF time, after trials, ſhould bring theſe ſwivel carriages into prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, I would recommend what I thought would be a further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement to enable the captain of the gun to point it to the object with ſtill more eaſe, by having a hole bored tapering in the centre of the caſcabel of each gun, and to have light round handy crows made to fit the holes, which, in my opinion, would give power to a ſingle man to point the gun in any direction from its higheſt elevation to its loweſt depreſſion, and without injuring the caſcable from anſwering all its neceſſary purpoſes.</p>
               <p>BUT in either ſort of carriages care ſhould be taken, that they are of a proper height, for the ports, for I have often ſeen guns mounted ſo low, that when the breech was raiſed they could not recoil clear of the cill of the ports, which is a great fault.</p>

               <p>WHATEVER may contribute to ſhelter and ſave the people muſt be allowed to deſerve notice. Various methods and things have been tried for this purpoſe. I was in a ſhip that had bags of ox hair, that was ſaid would reſiſt even cannon ſhot, but in fighting with a French frigate I ſaw one of her ſhot go through eighteen inch of hair, and through the middle of an eighteen inch maſt, and a long way over our ſhip afterwards, which proves no fence can be made about a ſhip againſt cannot ſhot, but only againſt ſmall and muſket ſhot, a fence may be made many ways.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER this fence or breaſt-work may be made to ſhelter the people from ſmall ſhot, in common they are no more than breaſt high, ſo that the muſketeers can fire fairly over it upon the enemy, but from experience in fighting, I have obſerved among new fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men there will always be ſome of them apt to ſhew that natural inſtinct of ſelf-preſervation, and in order to keep their heads under ſhelter of the breaſt work from the enemies ſhot, fire their muſkets at random up in the air. In ſeeing this, and to prevent the bad effect of ſuch examples, in fighting, I have made a faint lunge at a man's breaſt with my drawn ſword, and obliged to threaten death to any man that ſhould ſhew ſuch a bad example, though it muſt be allowed only a failing, and not a fault among new undiſciplined landſmen, firſt coming to action, eſpecially at ſeeing a man ſhot through the head above the breaſt-work, may ſhew a little fear, but by practice prove brave afterwards.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE to remedy this defect which I perceived in fighting the ſmall arms, in fitting out a privateer afterwards we had a rail, as in common, breaſt high on each ſide the quarter deck, and on the rails were fixed light iron crutches with the arms about a foot ſquare, and a ſhoulder to keep the bottom of the crutches about ſix inches above the rails, and thin boards about ſix inches broad laid upon the bottom of the crutches, and netting with large ſquare matches were ſo med juſt to hold a hammoc with its bedding long-ways, and from the gunnel to the rail was boarded up on each ſide of the ſtantions, and filled up with rope ſhakens, cork ſhavens, &amp;c. which is found ſufficient proof againſt muſket ball; which made ſo ready and good a fence for the quarter deck muſketeers, that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1112800100:182"/>
the moſt timorous could point his piece with the utmoſt confidence between the rail and the netting, and fire right upon the enemy, by having his head, as well as his body, under ſuch ſecure ſhelter.</p>
               <p>FOR the ſame reaſons in clearing and preparing the ſhip for fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I uſed to make the forecaſtle and top men, laſh the hammocs to ſhelter them, horizontally on the outſide of the fore and top-maſt ſhrouds, cloſe to one another breaſt-high, then a ſingle hammoc above leaving a little vacancy to point and fire their muſkets thro', which guards that tender and moſt important ſeat of knowledge, the brain part of the head, as well as the other parts of the body which it governs, from the enemies ſmall ſhot.</p>

               <p>AS the execution of the ſhot to conquer an enemy depends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on the goodneſs and ſtrength of the powder, which differs ſo much, that the greateſt care and caution is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to guard againſt being cheated in the quality of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1112800100:183"/>
for I have experienced ſome that looked very fine and good made for the uſe or rather ſhameful abuſe of the African trade, that inſtead of firing ſhot with ſufficient velocity, it would hardly fire itſelf, but ſpent itſelf in phizzing one phiz after another out at the touch-hole, and taken up ſo much time in burning, that it could not be uſed as priming for great guns.</p>
               <p>THIS baſe practice of making ſo very weak powder ſhould by ſome means be put a ſtop to, becauſe it not only hurts the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant adventurer, but the intention of government in giving ſo large a bounty on exportation for the encouragement of the trade of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good gun-powder. Therefore it ſhould be either under the inſpection of proper eſſay maſters, or bring into practice proper methods to try its ſtrength; and I can ſay from experience, that the common ſmall piſtol powder provers that drives a circular gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duated plate round, does not anſwer the purpoſe, for they will dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer greatly with the ſame powder.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">To prove the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note>THEREFORE I would recommend for this purpoſe of trying pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to have a gun of a half pound ſhot, fixed in a convenient place, mounted firm on a wood block or bed, elevated exactly at 45 degrees, and the powder to be tried by an ounce charge how far it will throw the half pound ſhot without any wad, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion for every foot or yard's diſtance under or over a ſtandard diſtance that might be fixed by government's powder, to aſcertain its ſtrength and value under or over proof, according to the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent trade or purpoſe it is deſigned for, as well as for privateers or letter of mart ſhips, which ſhould be of equal goodneſs with that for the Royal navy.</p>
               <p>ON ſhot, the firſt and principal, both for quantity and quality, is the round iron cannon ball, becauſe it will go and penetrate farther with a greater velocity than any other to do execution, when engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a ſuperior force, but when come to a cloſe fight with a ſhip of inferior force, expecting to make her a prize, then the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours ſhould be not to deſtroy the ſhip if it can poſſibly be avoided, but to diſtreſs them to make a ſubmiſſion, therefore ſome ſuitable ſhot that will anſwer that purpoſe beſt ſhould be provided.

               <head>On keeping a clean Bottom.</head>
               <p>THE great difference this makes in a ſhip ſteering, working, and ſailing, makes it a matter of ſuch importance, that all poſſible means ſhould be uſed to prevent the ſhip's bottom from growing foul, and the beſt method that I have experienced for this purpoſe is to be provided with what I call a cask ſcrubber, as repreſented in plate 9, fig. A, which I have often uſed in different ſhips with ſucceſs when at an anchor, and in calm weather on the open ocean. I had theſe ſcrubbers made of elm board about an inch thick and twelve broad, the middle part of the frame juſt to fit a ten gallon cask, that was laſhed to the battens at each end, and the long ſquare ſpaces on each ſide of the cask filled with birch broom ſtuff projecting about ſix inches without the frame, and wedged faſt towards the ends with long wedges againſt boards that ſlides with ſmall tenants at each end in a groove to keep the birch faſt and firm, for ſcrubbing the bottom, even cloſe down to the keel, and the iron work which unites the two parts by a joint that they may the more naturally ply to the curved or rounding parts of the ſhip's bottom, with the ſlings and the ropes faſtened to the eye bolts, may all be perceived and underſtood by looking with attention at the figure that repreſents that ſide of the ſcrubber that is hauled next to the ſhip's bottom.</p>
               <p>IN uſing this cask-ſcrubber we bad a block laſhed under the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprit end, and another on the driver boom rigged out right aft, and a ſingle rope reeved in theſe blocks, and made faſt to the ſlings marked 1, 2, in the figure, and juſt long enough to veer and haul the ſcrubber along the bottom fore and aft cloſe to the keel, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other rope bent to the lower part of the ſcrubber, as marked 3, and hauled tight under the bottom, and made faſt to the inſide of the boat's main thoft, when the upper part of the ſcrubber is even with the water's edge a midſhips on the other ſide, then the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was ordered to walk fore and aft with the rope to the ſcrubber, till it came up to the water's edge each way, the boat moving the ſame way with the ſcrubber, the people in her helping by puſhing

their hands againſt the ſhip's ſide, till the firſt depth is thought to be clean enough, then the people in the boat hauls by their rope the ſcrubber a depth lower, by which, and the empty casks, it is confined and preſſed to the bottom at the different depths, till it is ſcrubbed clean down to and even the keel itſelf, by the rope go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fore and aft under it.</p>

               <p>THE exerciſe of the great guns, as reduced from 40 words of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, (as they uſed to be,) to 14, are very well deſcribed in <hi>Falconer</hi>'s marine dictionary. But this being for the guns on the common car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, I take the liberty to mention the difference we uſed for the ſwivel carriages. At the word of command, caſt looſe the gun, the train or one of the gun tackles is hooked from an eye bolt amid-ſhips, to the train of the ſole of the carriage, and the gun bowſed in, till it has room to be breeched about to the foremoſt pall, turned down for
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1112800100:187"/>
that purpoſe; then turn down the after pall, which done, the guns are then ready to be run out either for exerciſe or action. And when the gun is run out, the two palls are to be turned back, with one motion, then the gun may be breeched about, and pointed by hand, fore or aft, on the object, or enemy, as much as the width of the port will allow. And when the object, or enemy, is much before the beam, let the guns be run out cloſe to the after part of the ports, and when abaft the beam cloſe to the fore part of the ports, that they may be pointed more fore or aft, as the occaſion may require, and the breechings not being ſeized, but rendered through the thimble at the breech, make both parts tight alike to bring the guns up in any direction they may be fired in, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foreward or aft. And when the guns are run in, breech about their muzzles forward, to load, then turn down the foremoſt pall, and breech the gun to it, and then down after pall, to run out the gun again, as before mentioned.</p>
               <p>THE exerciſe of ſmall arms I would recommend that it ſhould be done with as few motions as poſſible (and as is done in the front rank of our army) kneeling upon the right knee, and only riſing up to fire, as the place and occaſion may require; which not only keeps the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under ſhelter, but firm in their place, to do their duty without being toſted about by the ſhips motion in the ſea, eſpecially the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who cannot be expected to have got their ſea legs, as it is called, ſo as to ſtand firm to load their guns, when the ſhip has much moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <p>AS ſoon as the ſhip has got to ſea, I would recommend what was my practice, that is, to take the firſt poſſible opportunity to have all hands called to quarters; the officers, in their ſtations, to have every thing made properly ready and fit for action; to have a general exerciſe, not only of the great guns and ſmall arms, as before mentioned, but the method of working and managing the ſhip, to take the advantage of the openings, that I know, from experience, often occur, in attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or being attacked by another ſingle ſhip, which ſhould be ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by every commander, and the deſigned manoeuvers ſhould be taught the people in their general exerciſe, that they may know how to act,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1112800100:188"/>
and move regularly from one place and ſide to the other, as the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion may require, without confuſion, which is always the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, when the intention and management of the manoeuveres are not made known to the people in general.</p>
               <p>FOR theſe reaſon, as ſoon as poſſible, I uſed to make known to the people in general, that when a ſhip, of near equal force, brought to with a deſign to fight us, my intention was not to run directly along ſide, and lie to like a log, and depend upon meer battering, with one ſide only; nor upon the ſtern chace guns. When it is found that there is no chance of running from a ſhip of much ſuperior force chac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, and when their beſt ſailing is upon a wind, it is a common practice for them to run up and bring to under the lee, in a trumphant manner, depending on their ſuperior power, commonly demanding immediate ſubmiſſion, without expecting any reſiſtance. The deſigned manner of reſiſting or attacking, I always endeavoured to conceal as long as poſſible, as mentioned page 160; and theſe two caſes give all the advantages deſired by my method. Begining the attack upon the weather quarter, ſhooting the ſhip up in the wind, with the helm a lee, till the after lee gun, which we begin with, can be pointed upon the enemy's ſtern, then fire the lee-broad ſide, as it may be called, as repreſented in plate the 8th. The ſhip (figure 1) begins the attack upon the ſhip (figure 2) when the topſails are thrown a back, with the helm a lee, boxes the ſhip ſhort round on her heels, as mentioned in box hauling, page 52, ſo as to bring the wind ſo far aft, that the ſhip may immediately be ſteered cloſe under the enemy's ſtern, as the ſhip (figure 3) is repreſented, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning under the ſtern of the ſhip (figure 4) with particular orders to begin with the foremoſt gun, to rake them right fore and aft with the great guns, as they paſs in that line of direction, all aiming and ſiring to break the neck or cheeks of the rudder head, the tiller, ropes, blocks, &amp;c. that, if poſſible, to deſtroy the ſteerage tackle; which deſign, if it proves ſucceſsful, takes the management of their ſhip from them, ſo that ſhe muſt lie helpleſs, for a time in ſpite of their endeavours; and when the aftermoſt gun is fired, put the helm hard a weather to bring the ſhip by the wind, and then ſtand off on the other tack, to keep clear of their lee broad ſide, and act according to their motions, and the experience of the effect your attack has had upon them. If they continue to lie to, either to renew the attack again, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as ſoon as the ſhip will fetch their weather quarter again, or to

make ſail off to eſcape, if it has been found that the great inequality of their ſuperior force admits of no poſſible chance of conquering them; though this manoeuvere may have given this advantage, which, in my opinion, ought always to be attempted, and not to ſubmit tamely, tho' a ſhip is above double the force, becauſe by this manoeuvere the power of their broad ſides may be chiefly avoided.</p>
               <p>But when the inequality of force is not ſo great, but there is a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of conquering; and if the ſucceſs of the firſt attack is perceived to oblige the enemy to continue lying to, in order to repair the damage done their rudder or tiller, &amp;c. then the blow ſhould be followed, by renewing the attack again with all poſſible expedition, in the ſame manner, which gives the opening not only to fire the whole round of great guns, to advantage, but alſo to the marines and topmen to fire their ſmall arms, at the ſame time, to great advantange, to do the moſt execution poſſible by firing and raking them fore and aft thro' their moſt open and tender part, the ſtern, with the leaſt riſk poſſible from the enemies guns, therefore gives the greateſt poſſible chance, that I known of, to make an eaſy conqueſt, eſpecially, if ſo lucky as to deſtroy, and prevent, the recovery of their ſteerage. A ſhip of much ſuperior force may be brought to ſuch a diſtreſt condition as to be obliged to make a ſubmiſſion for want of the helm to command her, therefore when an opportunity offers, in fighting, this ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways aimed at.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe the enemy laid to as above mentioned, find themſelves not much hurt by this manoeuvere, and that you have not ſucceeded in deſtroying their ſteerage, and therefore you may expect that they will immediately tack, or ware ſhip, and ſtand after you, depending on their advantages of ſailing faſter, and ſuperior force, runs up along your lee ſide, expecting, by making a general diſcharge of their ſmall arms and great guns (charged with ſuitable ſhot) on your deck, which lies open to them by the ſhip heeling, to deſtroy your people and to make you ſubmit. When this is likely to be their deſign, orders ſhould be given to your people to keep themſelves as ſnug under ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as poſſible from their ſmall ſhot, till their general diſcharge is over, then if the ſhip is found not ſo diſabled, but that the topſails can be thrown a back, to make a general diſcharge, from the lee ſide, of the great guns, loaded with round ſhot only, pointed to the weather ſide of the enemies bottom, amid-ſhips to one point, at the water edge, and box haul the ſhip to run cloſe under their ſtern, aiming at raking
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1112800100:190"/>
and deſtroying their ſteerage, with the other broad ſide, and ſtand off on the other tack as before mentioned, to act according to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and the condition you find yourſelves in, compared with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of that of the enemy and their motions, who may be obliged to continue on the other tack to repair damages about their rudder, or to ſtop their leaks in the weather ſide of their bottom, if your aim has proved ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>BUT when an enemy's ſhip of force makes only a running fight, if there is no neceſſity to cut them off from the ſhore or from the ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of other ſhips, &amp;c. and you have the advantage of ſailing faſter,<note place="margin">O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>ON this occaſion when it blows freſh, and obliges to carry a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſail large, or before the wind, to make the great guns as ready as poſſible, and prevent their being fired too low, all their breeches ſhould be laid quite down in the carriages, and if your ſhip is crank, the yards ſhould be braced, ſo as to ſhiver the ſails at the time each broad ſide is fired.</p>
               <p>IN all theſe manoeuvers, when the whole round of great guns are deſigned to be fired, care ſhould always be taken to leave two or more men, as it may require, to charge each gun again when fired on one ſide, whilſt the others move over to fire the guns on the oppoſite ſide, that neither ſide may be left unguarded, all which with every other advantageous manoeuver that may be deſigned to be put in practice, in action,<note place="margin">On exer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciſing with a riſk to point the guns and fire at.</note> ſhould be taught the people along with the general exerciſe of great guns, and ſmall arms (as before hinted that I have done), by throwing a tight empty beef caſk over board, making it the object of attack, for all the guns to be pointed at, when performing the above deſcribed or other intended manoeuvers about it, firſt by running a little way large from it, then haul the wind tack ſhip and ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, keeping it about three points on the lee bow till within a half cables length, or muſket ſhot of it, then put the helm alee, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1112800100:191"/>
ſhoot the ſhip up in the wind with the topſails aback, till the after gun can be pointed to the caſk, then give the word of command to fire, when there is a fair opening to make a general diſcharge, both below and aloft on that ſide as repreſented (plate the 8th) the ſhip figure 1, begining the attack on the weather quarter of the ſhip, figure 2, as before deſcribed, which the caſk may be ſuppoſed to repreſent, as well as the ſhip figure 4; when you have box hauled your ſhip, and run cloſe paſt the caſk to make a general diſcharge from the other ſide, as repreſented by the ſhip, figure 3, then bearing round away from it, waring and haul the wind on the other tack, till you can tack and fetch up to it again to repeat this, or perform any other manoeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that may give an advantage to attack or defend a ſhip laid to, or ſailing upon a wind as above mentioned. To perform the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeuver of attacking an enemy that makes a running fight large, or before the wind, it is only to turn far enough to windward of the caſk, to give room in ſailing down to it to bring the ſhips broad ſide to point to it each way. But to perform this manoeuver to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advantage, with the leaſt loſs of time, and the ſhips way through the water, which may be of great importance on this occaſion to keep cloſe up with the enemy, therefore all the great guns ſhould be run out cloſe to the after part of the ports, that they may be pointed as far forward as the ſides of the ports will admit, and elevated as the heeling of the ſhip when brought to, to fire may require as before mentioned. And particular orders ſhould be given for the aftermoſt guns on each ſide to be fired firſt, as ſoon as they can be brought to bear upon the enemy, becauſe, then the ſhip need not be brought any more to, but ſteered in that direction till the other guns are fired, then ſhift the helm to ware to bring the other broad ſide to bear, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>AFTER the people have been thus diſciplined, it is neceſſary to let them ſmell powder, as it is termed. And a little ammunition ſpent in exerciſe is allowed, may be the means to ſave a great deal expended to little or no purpoſe in action, therefore I uſed to allow a ſmall charge of powder for the round of great guns, with ſtone ballaſt for ſhot, and the muſketeers two charges with balls each, and give them a fair chance, by theſe manoeuvers to fire both broad ſides, great guns and ſmall arms at the caſk, if they ſunk it all hands to have an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of grog, as it is called, but if they did not ſink it, to have the trouble and mortification to hoiſt out the boat and fetch it on board

to ſerve another time, by ſome ſuch means and methods only, it is poſſible to make the people expert in their duty to fight a ſhip to the greateſt advantages.

               <p>CRUISING the war before laſt in the employ of that great hero <hi>Fortunatus Wright,</hi> in the <hi>Mediterranian</hi> ſea, where the wind blows generally either eaſterly or weſterly, that is either up or down the ſtraits, therefore it was planned, with either of theſe winds that blew, to ſteer up or down the common channels the common courſe, large or before the wind in the day time without any ſail ſet, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's trading ſhips a ſtern crouding ſail with this fair wind might come up in ſight,<note place="margin">On cruiſing without ſail in the day, and under top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſails at night.</note> or we come in ſight of thoſe ſhips a head that might be turning to windward, and at ſunſet if nothing appeared to an officer at the maſt head, we continued to run five or ſix leagues as far as could then be ſeen before we laid the ſhip to for the night, to prevent the ſhips aſtern coming up and paſſing out of ſight before morning, or we paſſing thoſe ſhips that might be turning to windward, and if nothing appeared to an officer at the maſt head at ſunriſe we bore away and ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as before. And when the wind blowed acroſs the channels that ſhips could ſail their courſe either up or down, then to keep the ſhip in a fair way, in the day time to ſteer the common courſe under the courſes and lower ſtay-ſails, and in the night under top-ſails with the courſes in the brails, with all things as ready as poſſible to take or leave what we might fall in with in the night.</p>

               <p>FOR theſe reaſons, without the time, ſituations, circumſtances, and appearance require immediately to give chace with all your ſail at the firſt ſight of a veſſel, otherwiſe it often happens that you may ſtand a much better chance to ſpeak with a veſſel by endeavouring to way lay and conceal your deſign and ſhip from them, which may be done even in the day time with all the ſails furled as beforementioned, till within about four leagues diſtance, that is computed a ſhips hull in a clear horriſon begins to appear above it. When this concealment can be made, and to be all ready prepared to take or leave, and can fall in with the expected enemy in the night, or early next morning if they are found unprepared for action, muſt give a great advantage over them. But when you cannot be concealed from the expected enemies veſſels in ſight that may be coming with a fair wind towards you, then it ſhould be conſidered whether inſtead of giving chace with all your ſail ſet in fine weather, it may not be better to diſguiſe your ſhip to appear as an inoffenſive neutral ſhip, by geting your fore and mizen topgallant yards down, and the maſt ſtruck with only their heads above the caps, as mentioned page the 18th, and either ſtand upon the wind with the maintop gallant ſail ſet, if not noticed till by tacking you can fetch near the intended chace.

               <head>On towing and rowing a ſhip in chace</head>
               <p>CHASING in little winds and calms, may often require both to tow and row the ſhip with oars, therefore, to do it in the moſt advantageous manner, deſerves notice. When towing a ſhip to make her ſteer and work, it may require the tow rope not only from the bowſprit end, but from the jib boom-end which will give more power in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as it is farther from the ſhips turning motion to pull her about, but when towing to give a ſhip the moſt head way poſſible, the tow rope ſhould be made faſt no higher than neceſſary to keep it clear of the water.</p>
               <p>TO row the ſhip with oars, the oars ſhould be made ſuitable to the room the ſhip affords to row and ſtow them. In the <hi>Liverpool</hi> privateer, before mentioned, we rowed with eleven oars on each ſide, and ſculled with two, run out right aft, after the manner of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe.</hi> And in order to add more power, by more people pulling alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the oars on each ſide, and prevent the confuſion and hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that is occaſioned by the people's not pulling altogether, we had ſwifters for each ſide made of ſingle ropes with gromits in them, at the ſame diſtance of the row ports from each other, and put on the handles of the oars ſo that men could pull between the oars by theſe ſwifters, which after a little practice, ſoon made all the people pull completely together.</p>
               <p>THE two ſculling oars abaft were made crooked or curved, with the flat of their blades bending downwards, and an iron ſocket nailed to the under part of the oar at the port, when the blade was flat in the water,<note place="margin">On ſcull<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing Oars</note> and a ſhort bolt tapered and filed like a wood-ſcrew, with a round head, was fixed in the middle of the ports for the oars to turn upon, and ſtaples in the deck, right under the handle of the oars, to hook a line with an eye-ſplice on the handle of the oar that bears the ſtrain, whilſt the men ſcull by ſtanding on each ſide of the handle of the oar, and only have to pull to, and puſh from them with all their ſtrength, which makes the blade cant and act ſlanting downwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water each way with great power, to give the ſhip head way, and may likewiſe help to ſteer the ſhip and bring her about from one tack to the other, when it cannot be done by the rudder, and ſweep

I have obſerved with pleaſure their veſſels with 20 tons of goods and room to accommodate their families, ſculled by two men only, from the city of <hi>Canton</hi> (20 miles) to our ſhips, ſtemming and ſculling againſt the tide, running above two miles an hour and laying the ſhips on board in a ſafe and eaſy manner. And not only their large river veſſels, but their ſmall boats are moved very faſt through the water by this method of ſculling. I was one in a fine eight oar'd pinnace that was beat with eaſe and laughed at by two men in one of their common bumb-boats in ſpite of our utmoſt endeavours, this therefore deſerves notice, and might in my opinion be brought into uſeful practice among us, on many occaſions, in narrow rivers, canals, boats to land numbers of men where there is not room to row with oars, and our whale boats, &amp;c. for with the very power they ſcull the veſſel a-head they ſteer her at the ſame time, which muſt on this account be much better than a rudder, that ſtops water, as has been obſerved on rudders. I cannot forbear here remarking that theſe <hi>Chineſe</hi> ſculling veſſels are built upon good principles to anſwer their purpoſe, as all veſſels that are to be moved with oars or paddles ought to be, having flat rounding bottoms, with flanging projecting bows and ſterns, without keel, ſtem or ſtern poſt to hinder their ready turning, and drawing ſo little water that they are eaſily made to ſkim in a manner, at a great rate over the ſurface of it, where the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles give way much eaſier than they can do at a greater depth,<note place="margin">On Por<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſſes ſculling with the tails.</note> and their method of ſculling makes (them as much as poſſible for art) to imitate the nature of <hi>Porpoiſes,</hi> which ſcull with their horizontal tails ſwifter than any other fiſh we ſee at ſea, where they frequently ſeem to ſport and mock a ſhip when ſailing at the rate of ten miles an hour and will ſwim as may be obſerved ſculling with their horizontal tails croſs and croſs the ſhips bows at ſuch an angle, that they cannot go leſs than at the rate of 30 miles an hour, which muſt be allowed to make greatly in favour of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> method of ſculling their veſſels, inſtead of rowing them as we do with oars, which are levers, and our

               <p>BETWEEN and near the tropicks, it has been often remarked by the learned, that both winds and weather are moſtly periodical at different ſeaſons of the year, the barometer varies but very little; but in higher latitudes both north and ſouth, like the winds and weather it varies greatly all the year round, as mentioned pages 4, 5, 6, and tho' this inſtrument is found defective at times, yet it muſt be allowed the beſt guide we have for the purpoſe of ſhewing ſigns of good or bad weather; and I have been lately told from good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and experience, that the ingenious <hi>Edward Narn,</hi> optition, makes the marine barometer to ſtand the ſhip's motion at ſea without being diſturbed as before-metioned. I muſt own the many years ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations I have made on the barometer (ſince I printed off the above pages) I have often been diſapointed in expecting an eaſterly wind from the glaſs being high, which I find happens with weſterly as well as all other winds, and that a quick riſe as well as a quick fall of the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver ſhews changeable and uncertain weather. And that theſe changes of the weather and winds no way depend upon the ſituation or phaſes of the moon, or the ſun at the equinoxes, as they are too generally thought to do in this climate.</p>
               <p>FROM what has been ſaid on this ſubject, it is not to be doubted, but that alterations are made in the denſity of the different parts of the atmoſphere, that may cauſe the elements to move ſo as to give the appearences in the ſky, from which theſe ſigns and ſayings had their riſe. The evening red, and the morning gray, is the ſign of a fine day. A clear N. W. and a foul S. E. horizon a fiſherman's night. A rainbow or weather gall at morn, fine weather all gone. But a rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow towards night, fair weather in ſight. It is reckoned a bad ſign when tereſtial objects at a diſtance appear extraordinary clear and near, and when the ſtars appear very numerous and glaring the firſt of the night. And when a great white froſt appears in the morning.</p>

When the ſun ſets under a bank, a weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly wind you need not want. When the wind blows cold, it is likely to hold. An eaſterly wind right, commonly abates at night.

Yet I cannot help remarking, I have known many great, fatal, and total loſſes by ſailing in ſoutherly winds with drizling rain, eſpecially in the winter ſeaſon, which in this climate for ſeamen, may be reckoned to begin with <hi>October</hi> and end in <hi>March.</hi> When the wind from being moderate at S. S. E. after flies about ſuddenly to the weſtward and to N. N.

Beſides that ſtorm mentioned, pages 5th, and 6th, I have known many others that have been very deſtructive, and one in particular, that deſerves notice, to go againſt that vile cruel practice of preſſing ſeamen for government's ſervice. In the latter part of laſt foreign war, in the evening, I ſaw one of His Majeſty's ſnows of war with all ſail ſet crowding away with a large wind at S. S. E. and rainy weather, with about 140 preſſed men on board, that night the wind flew ſuddenly round to the oppoſite point N. N. W. and blew a ſtorm that muſt have overſet and ſunk her, for no remains was ever found but her barge that had floated off the booms. So that with a ſoutherly wind and rain, ſhips ſhould be upon their guard, and not be covetous of the weather ſhore, for fear it may ſuddenly prove a dangerous lee one on our coaſts.</p>

In further confirmation of this I was told by a commander that put this deſperate remedy in practice, that it would not have anſwered the deſign, if it had not happened from an accident that ſome of the lower ſtanding rigging on the lee ſide being omitted to be cut, brought the maſts up, and made ſuch ſtop waters on the lee quarter, as that only cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſhip to ware.</p>

               <p>TO do this muſt be of the utmoſt conſequence to a ſhip meeting with this misfortune in a dangerous ſituation. Therefore I venture to give my opinion that this may be done by the laſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned method, that is, by veering a hawſer or cable end over the lee quarter, but without any ſtop-waters, only the nun buoys, david, or any ſpare ſpars, maſts, or yards, laſhed along it, to buoy it up from taking the ground in caſe of coming into ſhoal water in little wind, this will act with great power with the helm to make the ſhip ware and ſteer at pleaſure. And as it is common in many ſhips, to carry a yard acroſs the ſtern with a block at each end for a driver boom, this I would recommend for this purpoſe, and the hawſer or cable to be veered out abaft the mizen ſhrouds over it, to guy it more or leſs from the quarter according as the ſhip may have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſail, that makes her gripe more or leſs on the helm, ſo as to require it, and it may be eaſily ſhifted from ſide to ſide to anſwer ſailing upon both tacks, to be guyed the more to leeward in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſhip's griping, and when ſailing before the wind to ſecure it over the middle of the ſtern will prevent the ſhip broaching to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the helm both ways. And this would anſwer the purpoſe to make a deep loaded bad ſteering ſhip to ſteer better, and prevent her broaching to either way, in ſpite of their beſt helmſmen, by which they are ſometimes obliged to lie too with a fair wind, as I was told by the commander of a ſhip who was an expert ſeaman, and a good commanding officer, was often obliged to do.</p>

               <p>BUT when this happens,<note place="margin">To endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ride out a ſtorm on a lee ſhore.</note> where there is clear anchoring ground at a good diſtance from the ſhore, and ſailing proves ineffectual to keep clear of it, then the chief dependence muſt be upon the ground tackle rightly applied to the beſt advantage; and it is in common reckoned a great diſgrace to let a ſhip go on ſhore with any ground tackle left on board that might have been uſefully applied. Suppoſe then the ſhip to be properly prepared, and to have let go a catch anchor, and towline bent like a buoy rope to the crown of the ſtream anchor, and the inner end of the ſtream cable bent to the crown of the ſheet or beſt bower anchor, with as long a ſcope of cable as poſſibly can be contrived, to make the ſhip ride ſafe and eaſy, as is particularly mentioned and recommended page 60 and 61.</p>
               <p>BUT where it is known, or found, by ſounding with the lead armed with tallow, that the ground is ſoul, then no more cable ſhould be veered out than neceſſity requires to bring the ſhip up, to ride with as ſhort a ſcope as poſſible, becauſe the cable is liable to be chaifed or cut in two by the rocks; if that happens, there is the more room aſtern and a better chance for a ſecond or third anchor, trying to the laſt moment all poſſible means to keep the ſhip from the ſhore.</p>

               <p>THIS often has, and may be the fate of many ſhips in ſpite of the utmoſt powers of men; and when a ſhip's ſituation is ſuch, that, to all appearance it cannot be avoided, then the utmoſt endeavours ſhould be uſed, and no poſſible means left undone, that may any way contribute to be ſerviceable on this laſt and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant occaſion, to ſave all the lives and property that is poſſible; whether ſucceſsful or not it deſerves the higheſt encomiums, as being the greateſt proof of true courage and good conduct.</p>
               <p>BUT ſhips ſituations, circumſtances, times, and places, are ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and various, that to give advice on this dreadful occaſion is difficult; yet, at all hazard, every thing ſhould be ſaid and done. For it is well known, from reaſon as well as experience, that to let a ſhip drive at random broad ſide, where the tide is flowing upon a moderate riſing ſhore, with her mainmaſt ſtanding, when ſhe comes to ſtrike hard upon the ground, by the waves running high, will ſoon overſet her on her broad ſide, and cauſe the hatches to blow off, then the waves will break in at the hatchways and compreſs the confined air within her, ſo as to add the power of blowing to that of beating the ſhip to pieces, which muſt afford little or no chance to ſave either lives or property, that is liable to be deſtroyed or ſpoiled by the waves, therefore likely to prove a fatal and total loſs.</p>

                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:1112800100:214"/>THESE reaſons, I hope, will be thought ſufficient to prove the neceſſity of endeavouring to point out better management; for it ſhould be conſidered, that a ſhip going on ſhore at theſe times, in a tide's way, upon a flood, will continue beating as long as the tide flows, and until it falls; and if ſhe lies broad ſide to the waves, they will have above three times more the power on her than when laid end on to them, and the mainmaſt ſtanding in the main body of the ſhip occaſions her to overſet at ſuch times; and it is well known, that a ſhip will bear but little beating upon her broad ſide in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what ſhe will bear upon her bottom.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE the beſt conduct, on this occaſion,<note place="margin">The beſt manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on a gradual riſing ſhore in a tide way.</note> is to uſe all poſſible means to keep the ſhip from going on ſuch a ſhore as this, till after high water; and the main and mizzen maſt being firſt cut away, then to run right before the wind and waves, with all the head way, and ſails that poſſibly can be ſet, end on upon the ſhore, to make the ſhip free herſelf the more, and to run the higher and faſter upon the ground, ſo that by the advantage of the tide falling, ſhe may ſoon be ſet ſo faſt as to be out of the power of the waves to hurt her much; by this management, in my opinion, not only all the lives, but the ſhip and cargo may be often ſaved, which would be all loſt by letting her go on ſhore at random with a flowing tide.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING a ſhip may be thus ſucceſsfully run and ſet faſt upon the ſhore, with little damage to her hull, and no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be apprehended till towards high water, the next tide, if the ſtorm continues ſo long,<note place="margin">To wait the beſt time to quit the ſhip.</note> yet people too often let their fears overcome their reaſon, and being in too great a hurry to quit the ſhip, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to get through the waves on ſhore, may often loſe their lives and the boats they go in; when if they would conſider and ſtay with patience till the tide falls low enough, they may get ſafe on ſhore with little or no riſk; and where the tide riſes and falls a great deal the ſhip may come quite a-dry at low water, which time muſt be allowed to be the ſafeſt and beſt to land, whether the ſhip dries or not, for the water is then ſmootheſt, and there will be the leſs way to go in it; therefore, if poſſible, the people ſhould be reſtrained from quitting the ſhip with the boats till towards low water, and when got ſafe on ſhore, it may be abſolutely neceſſary to preſerve the boats, if poſſible, by hauling them out of harm's way above high

               <p>TIME, circumſtances, and ſituations, are ſo various, that it is very difficult to write what may be to the purpoſe on this moſt melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly occaſion.

               <p>I WOULD propoſe theſe kites to be ſuch, as may be eaſily and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily made on board any wrecked veſſel, to conſiſt only of two ſlips of thin deal board, about three inches broad, and ſix, ſeven, or eight feet long, the middle of one nailed right acroſs the other, a little more than a third of their length, which forms what may be called the head part of the kite; then ſpan it tight round the ends with line, and ſew a piece of a light ſail over it with a ſail needle and twine; then ſling it with line from the four ends of the boards with a ſpan from the middle, to ſtrengthen that part where the bite of the rope, deſigned to be ſent on ſhore, is to be ſtopped to the ſlings; and at the bottom or tale part of the kite, about two fathom from the end of the rope, to which the creeper or grappling is to be bent, that will likewiſe anſwer the purpoſe of a balancing tail, to make the kite mount and fly in a gale of wind with a rope, as well as ſchool boys common paper kites will do with twine in moderate weather.</p>
               <p>NOW let it be ſuppoſed, that this ſtorm kite (as it may be called) may be made to fly with a grappling, &amp;c. at its tail from a wreck far enough to reach the ſhore. But then it may be aſked, how is the kite to be made to fall, ſo that the grappling may take hold upon the ſhore to anſwer the deſigned purpoſe? If the occaſion immediately requires this to be done, I would propoſe to try the experiment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by letting the kite rope ſuddenly run looſe, for a time, would not make the kite fall down to the ground, as the common kite does when its ſtring breaks. But without immediate neceſſity required to try this method, I would recommend another more ſure, and will add farther advantages towards anſwering the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>THE higher and ſtronger the ſtorm kite flies on this occaſion the better, becauſe it will take, what may be called, heavier or more

meſſengers, which, in my opinion, may be contrived ſo as not only to bring the kite down upon the ſhore, and be a help to hold the kite rope the faſter, but a hauling line may be alſo ſent on ſhore with the firſt meſſenger, which I would propoſe to be made of any piece of wood, ſpar, or plank, 8, 10, or 12 feet long, ſlung with ſmall rope from a ſingle block to each end in the form of a triangle, ſtitched over with a piece of ſail cut in that ſhape, and the kite rope reeved through the block with a hauling line made faſt to it, which may be ſent on ſhore by it; but if this firſt meſſenger fails to bring the kite down, a hole may be made near the middle of a main-hatch, or boards, &amp;c. and put upon the kite rope, and the wind will force them up as meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, ſo as ſoon to bring the kite down upon the ſhore; but, if it is not likely that any people will be there to give aſſiſtance to ſecure the kite rope, I would propoſe to drive ſome large nails to ſtand out from the lower parts of the wood of theſe meſſengers, to make them hold the kite rope and hauling line, the better to get on ſhore by them.</p>
               <p>SINCE writing the above, I have thought it would be worth while to try, whether a hauling line might not be bent to the grappling, and ſtopped along with the kite rope, and flown along with the kite at firſt.</p>
               <p>THE next experiment, for this purpoſe, I would propoſe to be tried is, how far it is practicable to ſhoot a grappling with a rope bent to it, laſhed along the outer end of a handſpike, &amp;c. made round juſt to fit the bore of a great gun, and long enough to reach from the ring of the grappling cloſe to the wad next the powder, with the gun elevated to its higeſt range, in order to get a rope from a wreck to the ſhore. And all the ropes that may be neceſſary to be joined together on this occaſion, ſhould be with long ſplices to anſwer this purpoſe beſt.</p>
               <p>LET it now be ſuppoſed, that a rope is got from the wreck to the ſhore, and ſecured as well as poſſible till ſome body can be got on ſhore by it to ſecure it better. To do this, I would propoſe to ſling in a light but ſecure manner to two ſingle blocks one at each end of ſome of theſe things that can be eaſieſt come at on board the wreck, ſuch as a cot, a ſcuttle caſk, a cheſt without its lid, a main hatch, or a cabin table, the lower ſide up, &amp;c. that a man or two, as the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and circumſtances may admit and require, may be ſecured in or
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1112800100:219"/>
upon this machine; then reeve the ſhore rope through the machine block, and to that part of the wreck where it may lead and be hauled tight to the greateſt advantage, to ſupport the machine, running or travelling upon it from the wreck to the ſhore, in the ſureſt and beſt manner poſſible; and if the wreck has any lower maſts ſtanding, the ſhore rope leading over the maſt head would moſt likely anſwer the purpoſe beſt, and the top afford a convenient place to get fixed in, and go from, with the machine to the ſhore. And a hogſhead, puncheon, or a butt, in my opinion, might be ſcuttled on each ſide of the bung for a machine, that two men might ſtand facing each other, to great advantage, to haul it on ſhore, if the ſituation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it, or any other thing that the ſhore rope and tackle may be thought ſtrong enough to bear.</p>
               <p>BUT the facility or difficulty attending theſe propoſals, are in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the diſtance and height of the ſhore from the wreck; if the ſhore is low, and near the wreck, the ſhore rope may be made to lead the machine upon it with an eaſy deſcent, from the wreck to the ſhore, with a man or two in it, without much ſtrain either to the rope or grappling on ſhore; when this is likely to be the eaſe, a line ſhould be made faſt to the machine, to haul it to the wreck again, by which means it may happen that a ſhip wrecked crew may ſoon get on ſhore with eaſe.</p>
               <p>BUT when the ſhore happens to be at a great diſtance, and much higher than any part of the wreck, this muſt naturally increaſe the ſtrain on the ſhore rope and grappling, &amp;c. that holds it, and to the man or men who are to haul the machine on ſhore by it. Therefore, to endeavour to caſe this ſtrain, I would propoſe, as it appears to me practicable, to contrive and ſix a ſmall ſail to the machine, ſuch as a hammock or two that has holes ready wrought at each end, a tarpaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or a piece of ſail cut for the purpoſe, that may be ſoon bent or ſtitched with a ſail needle and twine to light pieces of wood, one as a yard ſtopped to the head of an upright piece, or two, that may be ſtopped or laſhed to the after end of the machine as maſts, ſeven or eight feet high above it, next the ſhip, and the foot hauled down to the fore part of the machine next the ſhore; this ſail ſet to ſtand in this ſlanting direction upon the machine that is to run right before the wind in a ſtorm, will certainly help greatly to lift and leſſen the ſtrain of the machine upon the ſhore rope, and force it forward with
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1112800100:220"/>
great power towards the ſhore. And if, by any ſuch means as theſe, a man or two can be got on ſhore ſafe, they may ſecure things to the beſt advantage; and by hauling lines, &amp;c. may be the means of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the reſt of the people on ſhore, before the wreck is beat to pieces by the waves.</p>
               <p>BUT it may be ſaid, that the firſt adventurers in theſe machines run a great riſk, which muſt be allowed, but deſperate ſituations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire deſperate proceedings; when delays are dangerous, if this is the only method that appears to give a chance to ſave life, the firſt adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers ſtand the beſt chance if they ſucceed in getting on ſhore ſafe, when every minute the wreck may be liable to be beat to pieces, and all left on board moſt likely to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>NOW let it be ſuppoſed, that there is neither tide nor current to hinder any floating things being drove right on ſhore from the wreck, by the force of the wind and waves. Then a towline, or other ſuitable rope, with a hauling line, &amp;c. may be made faſt about the middle of a ſpar, maſt, or yard, &amp;c. and veered away on ſhore as far as it will go; and if it happens to be an uneven rocky ſhore, it may chance to fix itſelf faſt amongſt the rocks, by which I have heard a ſhip's crew got on ſhore, when they had almoſt given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up for loſt. But if it is a ſandy or gravelly ſhore, then no ſuch chance can be expected; it will then require ſome people on ſhore to haul it up, and put it under the ſand or gravel, its broad ſide to the wreck, (as deſcribed in page 74 on mooring ſhips) to make it bear the ſtrain that is neceſſary for the rope to be tight enough for the machine, as above-mentioned, to travel upon from the wreck to the ſhore.</p>
               <p>NOW let it be ſuppoſed, that a ſet of good people appear upon the ſhore, for the noble purpoſe of doing all in their power, to ſave the lives of thoſe diſtreſſed people on board wrecks, to ſucceed therein, it is abſolutely neceſſary that the people on ſhore ſhould be made to underſtand ſomething of the deſigned methods of proceeding. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beſt and approved methods that experiments may produce, ſhould be repreſented and deſcribed in prints, for the purpoſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtributed amongſt our ſhips,<note place="margin">Certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for poor people ſaving lives recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</note> and amongſt the inhabitants along our ſea coaſts, to be made as public as poſſible, and rewards of a guinea certain ſhould be allowed to the poor people on ſhore for every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

life ſaved by them from wrecks, and veſſels forced on ſhore, and <hi>Liverpool</hi> leads the way for this noble purpoſe; and in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the danger and trouble, they are to be rewarded with more than a guinea as thought by a Committee they deſerve; which encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement may likewiſe be the means of ſaving their own lives from the juſt laws of our country, by preventing their cruelty, for the ſake of plunder, on theſe occaſions. And might encourage them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and join heartily in whatever methods they perceive the people on board the wreck take to ſave themſelves, and to help them in it, by ſecuring the ſhore rope, or uſing the hauling line to haul the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine on ſhore if it is high above the wreck, or made faſt to a raft as the circumſtances and ſituation may require. And if ever the time come to have ſuch prints on board ſhips for this purpoſe; one of them ſhould be rolled up and put into a bottle, and ſent from the wreck to the people on ſhore, by ſome ſuch methods as has been mentioned, or throwing the bottle well cork'd into the ſea, to make them underſtand the deſigned method of proceeding, which may be the means of ſaving many valuable lives, as well paſſengers as ſhips crews, whoſe lives are undoubtedly of much more importance than ſhips. Theſe may be renewed, but they are of little purpoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good crews to navigate them; and the difficulty we now meet with, in manning both ſhips of war and merchants ſhips, ſhould teach us to uſe every method to preſerve the lives of our brave ſeamen, thoſe ſupporters of our glory, power, wealth, and conſequence as a nation; —they dare the raging tempeſt chearfully, and the dreadful ſlaughter from thundering cannon, does not diſmay them; therefore, how pleaſing muſt the thought and reflection be to all that contribute to help and ſave them.</p>

               <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>BEFORE I conclude, I ſhall beg leave to propoſe one farther conſideration to the ſerious attention of my Brother Sailors, however unſuitable it may appear to a ſubject of this kind, or to the profeſſion and qualifications of the Writer. I could wiſh to impreſs upon their minds a deep conviction of this great truth, that our own utmoſt ſkill, caution, vigilance, and dexterity, are altogether inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of themſelves to command ſucceſs in our proceedings, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us from the many dangers and difficulties we are expoſed to, without HIS all-powerful protection and aſſiſtance, whom the winds and waves obey.—<hi>Unleſs the Lord keep the Houſe or Ship, the Watchman waketh but in vain.</hi>—It is the Almighty, author of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone, who form'd the univerſe, and is preſent to all the parts of it, urging or reſtraining the elements,—promoting or obſtructing the deſigns of men according to the all-wiſe and beneficent purpoſes of his Government, upon whom our ſucceſs, happineſs and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion entirely depend.</p>
               <p>HOW diligently then ſhould we ſtudy and endeavour, by the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and piety of our lives, to recommend ourſelves to his favour and protection, and religiouſly implore his direction and aſſiſtance in all our undertakings;—knowing him to be our only <hi>ſure guide,</hi> our only <hi>certain help</hi> in trouble.</p>
               <p>AND we may be likewiſe aſſured, that it is this perſuaſion alone, and the conſciouſneſs of having endeavoured to regulate our lives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his divine Will, that can afford rational happineſs in the moſt proſperous circumſtances, or inſpire us with true courage in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and difficulties.</p>
               <p>THE virtuous and religous man, conſiding in his GOD, will, when his duty calls, face Death itſelf undiſmayed, having nothing to fear, but much to hope from it;—whilſt the impious and wicked upon the firſt appearance of danger are often ſtruck with ſuch panies, as
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:1112800100:223"/>
incapacitate them for acting properly for their own ſafety, or that of others, which may unfortunately depend upon their courage and conduct.</p>
               <p>IT would be needleſs to enumerate in confirmation of this truth the examples, with which hiſtory both ancient and modern abounds, as almoſt every one's own experience will abundantly ſupply them.— Indeed in the ſeafaring life they occur but too frequently, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us convincing evidence of the truth of thoſe texts of ſcripture, <q>
                     <hi>that</hi> there is no peace to the wicked, who are like the troubled ſea, which cannot reſt;—that they flee, when no man purſueth,—while the righteous are bold as a lion.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The moſt ſtriking proof I ever met with of this was in a tyrannical, impious, ſelf-ſufficient Commander of a ſhip in the <hi>Jamaica</hi> trade, under whom I ſailed; who openly made a mock of all religion, profeſſing in his converſation, that he was under no concern about it, that with a conſcience (as he term'd it) void of offence, a man might make himſelf very eaſy, and the like. But ſo far was he from this happy ſtate, that to extinguiſh thought and reflection he was almoſt conſtantly adding more guilt to his painful and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled mind, which made him viſibly a Hell to himſelf, and the ſhip like a Hell a float to all on board under his command; ſpending his time at ſea moſtly in exceſſive drinking, gaming, quarrelling, abuſing, and ill-uſing ſome part of his crew, even to breaking limbs, and endangering their lives. At the firſt of the voyage officers that refuſed to join him in his follies were called mean ſpirited fellows, &amp;c. and ordered up to the maſt-head in rainy weather, for a puniſhment, to look out during his pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>He would damn an officer, and aſk why he did not give the ſeamen ſugar plumbs, only for calling them by their proper names. He deemed it an act of piracy for the officer of the watch to offer to lower or take in ſail, or bear away from the courſe in heavy ſqualls of wind, though in the open ocean, and neceſſity might require it for the ſafety of the whole; but he muſt be called upon deck to take the command, and being commonly pot-valiant rather than be obliged, to lower or take in ſail, in ſqualls upon a wind, would cun and run the ſhip right before the wind, and carry ſail till ſhe was ſo over preſſed, as to loſe the power of the helm to command her.</p>
                     <p>Thus this over-bearing ſelf-ſufficient Hero thought to outbrave all the power of ſtorms, difficulties, and dangers, without damage; but it proved otherwiſe, for we met with ſuch and ſo many diſaſters, that once the general outcry of the ſeamen was to out boats and quit the ſhip; when this boaſting Hero was deſired to exert his authority to ſtop the people from it, he then, tyrant like, loſt all his boaſted courage, fell a crying like a child, and begged his officers to take the command and ſtop the ſeamen's proceedings, which juſt ſaved the ſhip, but not without great damage.</p>
                     <p>We were well armed for war againſt the declared enemies of our country, but our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander had the worſt of enemies, a guilty conſcience, within himſelf; for when quarreling with one part of his officers, the others were called up from ſleep in the night, to get the ſmall arms fited off and ſecured, to prevent, as he ſaid, the ſhip being taken from him.</p>
                     <p>It would be too much to relate the many great troubles this unhappy man brought upon himſelf in this voyage; and the next was his laſt, for they were never heard of after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from home.—I have been more prolix upon this miſerable character, that it may be a warning to others, who wiſh for ſucceſs and happineſs, not to follow his example</p>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:1112800100:224"/>BUT though our preſent as well as future ſafety and happineſs ſo much depend upon a good and holy life, yet ſuch is our deſperate and amazing depravity, that inſtead of rendering due honour and adoration to the Divine Being for his manifold gracious deliverances; —inſtead of invoking his aſſiſtance in dangers and difficulties, how often do we ungratefully blaſpheme his all-ſacred name by profane curſing and ſwearing.</p>
               <p>HOW ſtrange is it that Sailors, whoſe preſervation ſo viſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the providential care, which they almoſt daily experience, —who are, as it may be juſtly ſaid, but an inch breadth from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;—that they, more than any other claſs of men, ſhould be almoſt perpetually daring the Divine vengeance by this moſt unaccountable vice! A vice of all others the moſt irrational, which can offer neither pleaſure nor profit to tempt us to the commiſſion of it, nor urge in its vindication, what ſome other vices may, a natural propenſity: For no man, as Archbiſhop <hi>Tillotſon</hi> juſtly obſerves, can plead that he was born with a ſwearing conſtitution.</p>
               <p>OFFICERS ſometimes juſtify this wicked practice under a pretence that their orders would not be ſufficiently regarded, unleſs enforced by ſwearing.—Idle and vain pretence! as upon trying a different conduct, I am perſuaded, they will be ſoon convinced.—From my own obſervation and experience I can aſſert, that in critical emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, when the leaſt delay would be fatal to the whole, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity requires every one to exert his utmoſt, any ſort of ſharp words or threats uttered with an angry tone,<note n="*" place="bottom">Calling the unactive lubbers, and the like.</note> telling the men the neceſſity for their activity, and how much depends upon it, will have a better effect than vulgar oaths, which from being ſo frequently heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come no more regarded by them than common words;—they having from example and daily practice learned to ſwear, as profanely as their officers.</p>
               <p>THE ſhameful prevalence of this vice amongſt us and the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious influence of ill example are but too evidently ſeen from this, that the inferior ſort of foreigners, who have much converſation with us, generally acquire this common ſwearing part of our language firſt: —A melancholy proof that they hear it moſt frequently,—and are perhaps moſt inclined to imitate it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:1112800100:225"/>HOW highly incumbent then is it upon officers and thoſe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand always to diſcountenance this vicious practice by their own example; as no reformation without this can be expected;—eſpecially if they reflect that the more exalted a man's ſtation is, the greater is his crime; as its influence is more pernicious:—And ſince <hi>many a fruitful and flouriſhing land has been made barren for the wickedneſs of its inhabitants,</hi> every impious and profane man ought to be deemed and treated as the greateſt enemy to his country.</p>
               <p>BUT I indulge the pleaſing hope, that a reformation will now be ſoon produced by the virtues of our preſent moſt amiable Sovereign, in whoſe bright example we ſee piety, morality, and obedience to the laws of God and his country ſtrongly recommended.—And I would hope, that his wiſhes expreſſed in his firſt moſt excellent Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are not only publicly read in all his navy, as often as the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of war, but alſo enforced, to check the immorality and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which has too long prevailed amongſt ſeamen of all ranks and degrees.</p>
               <p>And in order to promote this good end, which every one, who has the intereſt of his country at heart, will endeavour as much as lies in his power, I would earneſtly recommend it to all Commanders of ſhips to have a reaſonable part of Divine Worſhip publicly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on board every day, or as often as conveniently may be;— which, to our ſhame be it ſpoken, is often, even in our large <note n="*" place="bottom">For the firſt fifteen years that I was at ſea, in different trades, I never ſaw any religious duty publicly performed on board, except that in an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> ſhip, for two or three <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,</hi> when we drew near the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> we had prayers, which ceaſed after we paſſed the <hi>Cape.</hi>—Does not this indicate that the fear of approaching danger was the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and not a grateful ſenſe of thoſe inceſſant benefits, we are conſtantly receiving?— Indeed that great Company, or their Managers, are highly blamable in ſhamefully rating thoſe large ſhips only at 499 tons, in order to evade the expence of a Clergyman, and the penalty of the Law for not carrying one.—It would be well for them to conſider, that acting upon chriſtian principles is the only true policy; and that ſchemes upon any other principles, cunningly deviſed, for the accumulation of wealth, may, and moſt likely will in the event, prove unto them only an occaſion of falling.</note> 
                  <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> ſhips, ſcandalouſly neglected.</p>
               <p>THIS, I think, I can ſay from profitable experience, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes greatly to produce good order, harmony, and piety on board, and check diſorder, vice and immorality of every kind,—even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:1112800100:226"/>
the moſt diſſolute and ignorant in privateers, as well as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſhips.</p>
               <p>NO rational Being ſurely can want exhortation to this moſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and bounden duty:—For <hi>man,</hi> the only animal in the creation, ſo diſtinguiſhingly favoured,— endowed with faculties to contemplate the glorious works of the creation, and enjoy his portion of the good things thereof with gratitude to the great Creator, and benevolence to his fellow-creatures,—for <hi>man,</hi> I ſay, to want piety and religious ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is worſe than brutiſh.—For <hi>man,</hi> bleſſed with the lights of the Goſpel to direct him in his duty, to reform, improve and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify his nature for higher enjoyments,—pointing out to him, what is moſt conducive both to his preſent and future happineſs, to renounce theſe high privileges, and blindly wallow in ſenſuality—is truly mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous.</p>
               <p>BUT after all,—though our religion lays no reſtraints upon us, but ſuch only as promote our preſent happineſs, both as individuals and members of ſociety,—yet ſuch is our miſerable frailty, and ſo many, various and powerful are the enemies and temptations we have to contend with in our courſe, that of ourſelves, as we have deplorable conviction from daily experience, we cannot but fall.</p>
               <p>WITH what humble gratitude then, what ardor of affection and adoration ſhould we embrace the <hi>great Salvation</hi> revealed in the Goſpel, procured and purchaſed for us at ſo dear a price and in ſo myſterious and ſtupendous a manner!—and <hi>freely</hi> offered us, ſo much in need, and ſo wholly unworthy of it! What <hi>ailigence</hi> ſhould we uſe,—what holineſs of life ſhould we aſpire after, to enſure to ourſelves an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in this grand ATTONING SACRIFICE! And how devoutly ſhould we implore the promiſed aſſiſtance of <hi>his aiding and ſanctifying grace</hi> to conduct us ſafe through this tranſitory voyage of life, to a bleſſed and happy eternity.</p>
               <p>LET us then, under the direction and guidance of this great AUTHOR and CAPTAIN of our SALVATION, our all-glorious REDEEMER, CHRIST JESUS, purſue our courſe with ſteadineſs and reſolution, and fight manfully under his banner,—looking upon him for ſuccour in all our diſtreſſes and difficulties, who is all-powerful in Heaven and Earth, and will never forſake or reject thoſe, who ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely love and truſt in him.—To whom be Glory for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
