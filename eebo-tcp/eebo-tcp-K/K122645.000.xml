            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>ALTHOUGH the following Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay originated in a private controverſy; that is, a controverſy carried on for ſome time in private, between the Church of which I am a member, and ſome other Churches of the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination; and although I am in ſome meaſure ſenſible of my literary defects; yet ſomething may be ſaid by way of apology for my appearing thus in print.</p>
            <p>(1) We have no other way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating our ſentiments to all who are concerned in this controverſy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:1242700400:4"/>
(2) Some who were not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concerned herein, have heard of the diſpute; and our ſentiments have been ſo much miſunderſtood, that it ſeems neceſſary to rectify theſe miſtakes. (3) The SUBJECT in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is, in our eſtimation, of infinite importance, and of univerſal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore I have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined myſelf to the queſtion as it ſtood amongſt ourſelves; but have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to treat it in ſuch a manner as to make this Eſſay equally intereſting and uſeful to all who read it. (4) Although the truth of Chriſtianity <hi>in general,</hi> has been ſupported with abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſucceſs againſt the bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack made by Mr. Thomas Paine;
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:1242700400:5"/>
yet I have not met with any thing which I could eſteem as a ſufficient reply to the argument he has urged againſt that grand peculiarity of the Goſpel,—<hi>the doctrine of Redemption.</hi> I have therefore attempted ſomething in that way. (5) I am in hopes that (if there ſhould ſeem a neceſſity for it) this little Eſſay may give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſome more able Friend, to take up his pen.—For the reſt, I can only ſay to the <hi>Critic,</hi>—Spare me!—but to the <hi>Deiſt, Jew,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> I ſay—Spare not!—So much by way of Apology.</p>
            <p>I have uſed, very freely, every thing I found to my purpoſe in human Authors; but I never reſt any part of the argument upon their <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1242700400:6"/>
They frequently helped me to expreſs my own thoughts with more eaſe and clearneſs, than I could otherwiſe have done; and therefore I uſed their Words; but ſo far am I from building upon the authority of their Names, that I differ widely from almoſt all of them, upon other matters.—The Age of Popery is gone: let every man now exerciſe <hi>his own</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning Powers, and <q rend="inline">"be fully perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>his own</hi> mind."</q>
            </p>
            <p>But although I reject all human au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in matters of a <hi>religious</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I have ſo frequently referred to the Authority of Revelation, that I fear the reader will not have patience to examine the Sacred Text: yet it is
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:1242700400:7"/>
what he ought to do.</p>
            <p>As to that part of the book which is controverſial; I can only ſay, (1) I hope I have neither miſrepreſented the ſentiments, nor abuſed the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any man. (2) The replies I have made, and the proofs I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, appear to me to be concluſive; and I am fully ſatisfied that the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine we maintain, is the moſt juſt to God, and the moſt ſafe to man, that can be imagined. But I do not expect that every one elſe will be thus minded. When we do not like a ſentiment, it is eaſy to miſrepreſent it to ourſelves and others; we can ſtart objections, and refuſe to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: and as to ſcripture texts, we can
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1242700400:8"/>
either find a different ſenſe for the words as they ſtand, or we can alter the tranſlation. At leaſt we may dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or perplex the queſtion ſo as to make it a matter of doubtful diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which therefore ought not to be inſiſted upon. For inſtance:—</p>
            <p>Some, perhaps, may ſay,—What a piece of work is here about a ſingle word! Chriſt is called a <hi>Surety</hi> only once in all the Bible; and even then he is not ſaid to be the Surety of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> but the Surety of a <hi>Teſtament.</hi>—Yet here is a book written upon the Suretiſhip of Chriſt!—I ſhall conclude the Preface with a reply to this.</p>
            <p>(1) Although Chriſt is only <hi>once</hi> expreſſly called a Surety; yet ſince it
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1242700400:9"/>
is GOD who calls him ſo, we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely certain that Chriſt does ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Character. We do not find that it was ſaid to Adam, any more than <hi>once,</hi>—<q rend="inline">"On the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die."</q>—Was the threatening leſs certain? or of leſs importance? I might mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply inſtances of this kind. The word <hi>Atonement</hi> occurs but <hi>once</hi> in the New Teſtament; but the thing intended thereby is often mentioned: ſo it is with reſpect to the Suretiſhip of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As to the word <hi>Teſtament,</hi> it will be granted that it is of the ſame import, in this place, as the word <hi>Covenant.</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>See Mr. M'Lean's treatiſe on the Apoſtolic Commiſſion. p. 59.</bibl>
               </note> Now as this is certainly a covenant
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:1242700400:10"/>
between GOD and <hi>man,</hi> Chriſt muſt be the Surety of <hi>ſinners,</hi> for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſons:</p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">(1) "EGGUS <hi>or</hi> EGGUHTHS, <hi>A Surety;</hi> is one that undertaketh for another wherein he is <hi>defective;</hi> really or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. Whatever the undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be, whether in words or promiſe; or in depoſiting a real ſecurity in the hands of an arbitrator, or by any other perſonal engagement of life and body, it reſpects the <hi>defect</hi> of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for whom any one becomes a ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Such an one is <hi>ſponſor</hi> or <hi>fidejuſſor</hi> in all good authors and common uſe of ſpeech. And if any one be of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute credit himſelf, and of a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation very unqueſtionable, there is
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:1242700400:11"/>
no need of a ſurety, unleſs in caſe of mortality. The words of a ſurety in the behalf of another, whoſe ability or reputation is dubious, are, <hi>(ad me recipio, faciet aut faciam,)</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"I take the matter upon me, he ſhall do it, or I will."</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) God therefore can have <hi>no ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> properly, becauſe there can be no conceiveable <hi>defect</hi> on his part. There may be indeed a queſtion, whether any words or promiſe be <hi>his;</hi> but to aſſure us of that, is not the work of a ſurety, but of <hi>any means</hi> whatever that may give <hi>evidence</hi> that it is ſo. He doth indeed make uſe of <hi>witneſſes</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his word; that is, to teſtify that he hath made ſuch promiſes; but the
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:1242700400:12"/>
difference is wide enough between a <hi>witneſs</hi> and a <hi>ſurety;</hi> for the latter muſt be of <hi>more ability,</hi> or more credit and reputation, than he for whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages, or there is no need of his ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip. This none can be for God.—And if this be not the notion of a ſurety in this place, the apoſtle makes uſe of a word no where elſe uſed in the whole ſcripture, to teach us that which it doth never ſignify among men; which is ſufficiently improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and abſurd. For the ſole reaſon why he made uſe of it was, that from the nature and notion of it among men in other caſes, we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what he aſcribes under that name to the Lord Jeſus."</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:1242700400:13"/>
(3) "We on all accounts <hi>ſtand in need of a Surety</hi> for us, or on our behalf. Neither without the interpoſition of ſuch a Surety could any Covenant between God and us be firm and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or an <hi>everlaſting Covenant,</hi> ordered in all things and ſure. In the firſt Covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi> there was no Surety, but God and men were the immediate Covenanters. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we were then in a ſtate and condition able to perform and anſwer all the Terms of the Covenant, yet was it broken and diſannulled. If this came to paſs by the failure of the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of God, it was neceſſary that on the making of a new Covenant he <hi>ſhould have a Surety</hi> to undertake for
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:1242700400:14"/>
him, that the Covenant might be ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and everlaſting. But this is falſe and blaſphemous to imagine. It was <hi>man alone</hi> who ſailed and broke that Covenant. Wherefore it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that upon the making of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and that with a deſign and purpoſe that it ſhould <hi>never be diſannulled</hi> as the former was, that we ſhould have a <hi>Surety</hi> and undertaker for us. For if that <hi>firſt Covenant</hi> was not firm and ſtable becauſe there was no <hi>Surety</hi> to undertake for us, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that Ability which we had to anſwer the terms of it; how much leſs can any other be ſo, now our Natures are become de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved and ſinful? Wherefore we
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:1242700400:15"/>
alone were <hi>capable of a Surety</hi> properly ſo called; we alone <hi>ſtood in need of</hi> him, and without him the Covenant could not be firm, and inviolate on our parts. The Surety therefore of this Covenant is ſo with God for us.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) "It is the <hi>Prieſthood of Chriſt</hi> that the Apoſtle treats of in this place, and that alone. Wherefore, ſeeing the Lord Chriſt is the Surety of the Covenant <hi>as a prieſt,</hi> and all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal actings of Chriſt have God for their <hi>immediate object,</hi> and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with him on our behalf, he was <hi>properly</hi> A SURETY FOR US"</p>

The following pages are deſigned to ſtate and defend that work which Chriſt performed in the capacity of a SURETY. I have attempted to prove that he acted in this capacity, from his infancy to his death, in obeying the commandments, and ſuffering the penalty of the Moral Law. This is the DOCTRINE, however expreſſed, which theſe lines are intended to maintain. I contend not about parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular words or modes of expreſſion. THE TRUTH ITSELF, and not any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mode of expreſſing it, is that which I labour to defend. Neither is it every particular <hi>circumſtance</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the life, death, reſurrection and aſcenſion of Chriſt, as they are
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:1242700400:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtated in this Eſſay, which I contend for. I have mentioned theſe circumſtances as I found them, or as I think I found them, in the ſcriptures, and that for the ſake of illuſtration; but they are not all <hi>eſſential</hi> to the main point, as expreſſed above.—Therefore, if any one ſhould think it his duty to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvert upon this Eſſay, let him not ſpend his time in cavilling at meer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions or circumſtances; but attend to the main Doctrine in queſtion.</p>

In this ſenſe we ſee many in our own days doing the work of the law, even while they are in the act of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying it. We can ſee the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous characters amongſt men accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing each other, and by their rapid exchange of the odious terms, <hi>drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, whore, thief, lyar, ungrateful,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1242700400:25"/>
we ſee them very quick ſighted, and very capable of doing that work of the law which conſiſts in condemning the guilty. Now Paul ſays they did this in his days, <hi>by nature.</hi> Moreover,</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſhews, not only that the heathen had a ſenſe of right and wrong, but alſo that they knew the judgment of God againſt ſinners.<note n="m" place="bottom">

               <p>There are two oppoſite extremes which ſome men run into upon this ſubject. Some deny the very exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the law of nature; whilſt

others contend for it's ſufficiency to bring <hi>fallen</hi> man to happineſs. Both parties are wrong. The law points out our duty, finds us guilty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns us, and there it leaves us.</p>
               <p>When we read the hiſtory of all times and nations,—when we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what daily paſſes before our own eyes and in our own breaſts, we find a melancholy proof of the scripture doctrine concerning our depraved ſtate.

               <p>IF in tracing the lowly ſteps of Immanuel from Bethlehem to Calvary, we ſhould view him as a ſingle indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual acting for himſelf alone, much of the beauty of his ſacred hiſtory would be loſt. To guard againſt this, it may be uſeful to take ſome notice in this place of the unity, or oneneſs, of Chriſt and his Elect. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired writers ſpeak much of this union, and illuſtrate it in a variety of ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This union was fore-ordained—it was fixed upon in the Divine mind

               <p>It is eaſy to ſee in Pilate, the great man in embarraſſment.

                  </note> The Jews, upon the other hand, called this Blaſphemy.—Again: Jeſus maintained that all men, himſelf only excepted, were ſinners; and that they could obtain the divine favour only through him.<note n="c" place="bottom">

                  </note> But the Jews could by no means admit the truth of this: they, being ignorant of God's righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, could not ſubmit to be ſaved by the righteouſneſs of our incarnate God.<note n="d" place="bottom">

               <p>Theſe were the chief points in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate between Jeſus and the Jewiſh nation; and when Jeſus was dead and buried, they hoped that this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy was decided in their favour.

Let Chriſt the King of Iſrael deſcend from the Croſs, that we may ſee and believe. He truſted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him; for he ſaid, <hi>I am the Son of God.</hi>

               <p>This triumph was premature. The deciſion of the queſtion did not turn

upon his coming down from the Croſs, but upon his riſing again from the dead. This was to be the grand proof on either ſide.

               <p>This medium of proof had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly fixed upon. The Jews, more than once, demanded a ſign of his being the Meſſiah; and Jeſus referred them to his reſurrection.<note n="f" place="bottom">

               <p>
                  <hi>THE famous Author of the Age of Reaſon ſays,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"<hi>The doctrine of Redemption has for its baſis, an idea of pecuniary juſtice, and not that of moral juſtice. If I owe a perſon money, and am not able to pay him, and he threatens to put me in priſon, another perſon may take the debt upon himſelf, and pay it for me; but if I have committed a crime, every circumſtance of the caſe is changed: moral juſtice cannot take the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent for the guilty, even if the innocent would offer itſelf.</hi>"</q> To this we reply,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This diſtinction between <hi>moral</hi> Juſtice, and <hi>pecuniary</hi> Juſtice, has no
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1242700400:99"/>
foundation in the nature of things. Juſtice is <hi>moral</hi> Juſtice ſtill, whether it has to do with money or with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. When the moral law ſays, Owe no man any thing, it delivers a <hi>moral</hi> precept, and ſpeaks the language of <hi>moral</hi> Juſtice, no leſs than when it ſays, Thou ſhalt not kill. What! is it no <hi>crime</hi> to contract debts when we are not able to pay? Surely it is. Yet if my friend is willing to become Surety for me, however innocent he may be, moral Juſtice requires that he ſhould ſmart for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When a Surety is admitted in any caſe, his admiſſion is founded, not upon Juſtice <hi>only,</hi> but alſo upon mercy. If I owe money and am not able to pay it; and if Juſtice admits of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon taking the debt upon himſelf and diſcharging it for me, this is uniting Juſtice and mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1242700400:100"/>
When my friend ſees me in diſtreſs, takes my place, and diſcharges my debts; this is an act of <hi>mercy;</hi>—Juſtice admits, but mercy performs it. Again: When my creditor demands payment of my Surety, his doing ſo is an act of Juſtice. So that, in this caſe, Juſtice <hi>demands,</hi> and mercy <hi>grants</hi> payment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From hence we may diſcover the principle upon which the office of a Surety is founded. It is ordained chiefly for the ſake of harmonizing Juſtice and mercy. Theſe two attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, in many caſes, ſeem to claſh. Juſtice might require the law to be put in force againſt an unfortunate or diſhoneſt debtor; while mercy might prompt a Judge to ſpare him, either for his own, or for his miſerable fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's ſake. What is to be done in this caſe? If Juſtice is heard, mercy cries
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1242700400:101"/>
in vain: if mercy prevails, Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires diſſatisfied: but by the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Surety, mercy and Juſtice kiſs and embrace each other. Does this render either attribute leſs ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? Far from it: It heightens their native charms.—If Juſtice had refuſed the propoſal of a Surety—a Surety every way able to anſwer its demands, would it not ſeem too implacable? And upon the other hand, if mercy had inſiſted upon the debt being can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled without payment, when the Surety could well afford it, would it not appear an enemy to Juſtice; and might not the creditor juſtly complain?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Having diſcovered the principle upon which the office of a Surety pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, to determine, in any particular caſe, whether a Surety may or may not be admitted, we muſt conſider whether the circumſtances of the caſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1242700400:102"/>
be ſuch, that, all things conſidered, the admiſſion of a Surety can ſubſerve the mutual purpoſes of Juſtice and mercy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We can now explain how it comes to paſs that human laws can ſo ſeldom admit of a Surety in criminal caſes. I ſay, <hi>ſeldom,</hi> becauſe even human laws ſometimes go this far: as, for inſtance, when a <hi>crime</hi> is puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a fine, which is often the caſe, a man's friend may pay it for him. Again: ſometimes when a crime is committed, the criminal is ſet at liberty by finding ſureties for his future good behaviour; and if he afterwards is guilty of the ſame crime, his ſureties are liable to ſuffer in his ſtead. And again: <hi>National Hoſtages</hi> are a very ancient and general expedient. In this caſe it is univerſally allowed that, when any perſon delivers himſelf up
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1242700400:103"/>
as the hoſtage or ſurety of his nation, he is liable to ſuffer for the crimes of his country. But, as has been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it is not always that human laws can admit of a ſurety in criminal caſes. This is not becauſe our legiſlators con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the principle itſelf; for if they did, how could they adopt it in the inſtances juſt alluded to? but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, They find, in certain caſes, the circumſtances are ſuch that a Surety cannot be made to ſubſerve the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual purpoſes of juſtice and mercy, or anſwer any good end; but would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be attended with many evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. For inſtance: When mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is committed, juſtice demands life for life; and here it is impoſſible, amongſt men, to make uſe of a ſurety. Becauſe (1) Who would willingly die for a murderer? (2) If ſuch a perſon could be found, who gave him power
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1242700400:104"/>
over his life, to diſpoſe of it in ſuch a way? (3) There would be no ſecurity for the future conduct of the criminal; and therefore it would only be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſociety of a uſeful member, to give back one who might immediately commence his former deſtructive practices. (4) It could not even ſerve the purpoſe of mercy, becauſe all that mercy might gain by the ſalvation of the criminal, it would loſe again in the death of his ſurety.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For theſe cauſes we grant to the objector, that, in many caſes of a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal nature, <q rend="inline">"All the circumſtances are ſo changed, that moral juſtice cannot take the innocent for the guilty;"</q> that is, juſtice cannot, under theſe circumſtances, admit of a ſurety. But then, when theſe circumſtances come to be named, not one of them can be objected to the Suretiſhip of Chriſt.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1242700400:105"/>
For inſtance, (1) He had abſolute power over his own life, and a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign right to diſpoſe of it as he ſaw good. Moreover, having humbled himſelf to the ſtate of a ſervant, he acted, not only by his own choice, but in obedience to the commandment of his Father. (2) No individual beſide himſelf ſuſtained the leaſt inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from his undertaking. He did not redeem his people that they might continue their pernicious practices; but made it abſolutely certain that they ſhould leave them off, and begin a life of righteouſneſs, the moment they ſhould be made acquainted with what he had done for them. Their language upon this occaſion is, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man. I reſtore him four-ſold. (3) In ſubſtituting Jeſus in the room
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1242700400:106"/>
of the guilty, all the ends of mercy, as well as divine juſtice, were fully anſwered: Myriads of men were thus raiſed from the greateſt depth of guilt and miſery, to an eternity of holineſs and happineſs. And although this coſt our divine Surety much, yet, in the end he obtained what he deemed an ample recompenſe. He had power, not only to lay down his life, but alſo to take it again: he ſaw of the travel of his ſoul, and was ſatisfied: he ſaw the eternal happineſs of his people ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; and this gave him infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: he ſaw every perfection of the God-head glorified in the higheſt, and the foundation laid for eternal halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah's from all the bleſſed: and he ſaw himſelf, in his human nature, crowned with that glory which, in his divine nature, he had with his Father before the world was. Theſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1242700400:107"/>
conſiderations go to prove that it was perfectly conſiſtent with juſtice, as well as glorious to divine mercy, to ſubſtitute Jeſus in the room of his guilty people. To this we muſt add,</p>
               <p n="7">7. It would not be conſiſtent with juſtice to admit a <hi>ſinner</hi> to glory, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this ſubſtitution. Mercy might provide ſuch a ſurety as juſtice could admit; but mercy could not, conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently with juſtice, beſtow happineſs on the guilty without a Surety. No reaſon can be given why juſtice ſhould refuſe this Surety; but many reaſons may be given why it ſhould demand him. For inſtance: If the ſinner had been ſaved without this Surety, the divine law would be made void. The part of a ſubject is to obey; the part of a Sovereign is to keep up the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his laws. Though ſubjects neglect their part, the Sovereign may
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1242700400:108"/>
do his. Though the law be broken, yet while that treatment is given to diſobedience and obedience which the Law-giver has appointed, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the law is ſtill kept up: but if the Sovereign neglect his part, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the execution of the law, then the law paſſes away, and, in effect, the Governor reſigns his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and tolerates all manner of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and confuſion. It is ſhocking to that reaſon which God has given us, to ſee a magiſtrate without power over his ſubjects; to ſee a parent without authority among his children, or a maſter among his ſervants: but this is nothing in compariſon with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding GOD deſtitute of authority among his creatures. In other caſes, this want of authority would produce confuſion only in kingdoms or families; but in this caſe it would bring the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1242700400:109"/>
whole univerſe into diſorder. The former would infer confuſion only for a <hi>time:</hi> but this introduces confuſion to <hi>eternity.</hi>

               <p>I ſhall conclude this article with two very oppoſite ſpecimens of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and leave the Reader to his choice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thomas Paine, after telling his readers that, <q rend="inline">"No <hi>external</hi> evidence can, at this long diſtance of time, be produced to prove whether the church fabricated the doctrine of redemption or not," adds, "therefore the queſtion can only be referred to the <hi>internal</hi> evidence which the thing carries in itſelf; and this," continues he, "affords a very ſtrong preſumption of its being a fabrication; for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal evidence is, that the doctrine of redemption has for its baſis, an idea of pecuniary juſtice, and not that of moral juſtice."</q>

Jonathan ſays, <q rend="inline">"As the character of THE JUST GOD AND THE SAVIOUR can no where be publiſhed but along with the doctrine of redemption, I am aſſured, by ſeeing the GRANDEST CHARACTER thence ariſing, that the doctrine muſt be true. For to ſuppoſe that the bare notion, or idea of any thing greater than God could ever be any where imagined, would be the wildeſt of all abſurdities. Moreover, it muſt be very evident that that view of God, which the lower it abaſes the pride of man, raiſes his comfort and joy the higher;—which reduces man to the moſt unreſerved dependence, while it exalts him to the ſummit of all happineſs; could never be the contrivance of man, whoſe ſtrongeſt impulſe is towards the gratifying of his pride, and whoſe joy naturally riſes or ſinks according to the ſucceſs
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1242700400:111"/>
thereof. Therefore, when the doctrine of redemption, and the character of God thence reſulting, are conveyed to my mind by the ſame teſtimony, I have no room to doubt, that God, who alone can deſcribe his own cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, is the teſtifier of both."<p>"This doctrine," continues Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, "while it proves all my former wiſdom to be fooliſhneſs, opens to me a new and more delightful ſource of knowledge, throwing light upon a thouſand facts that I could never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for before; ſhewing me a no leſs ſatisfactory than wonderful propriety, in all the extraordinary circumſtances attending the Birth, Life, Death, and Reſurrection of Jeſus, and the miniſtry of his witneſſes.—It throws light upon all the ancient ſacred writings, and the extraordinary facts recorded in them, from the creation downwards.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1242700400:112"/>
It ſets my mind at reſt, as to all the difficulties about the divine character, and the condition of man, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally pinched me before.—I am now reconciled to the entrance of ſin and death into the world, and the whole dark ſide of things, on account of the light that ſhines from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt darkneſs.—I am now reconciled to the ſhade, on account of the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent picture thence ariſing to my view. In a word, I thence perceive a no leſs amiable than grand uniformity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, in all the works of God, from firſt to laſt. Whereas, ſhould I ſhut my eyes againſt the light iſſuing from thence, I am immediately loſt in an unfathomable abyſs of—guilt, deſpair, and death."</p>
                     <p>"I am fully ſatisfied, then, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with the Apoſtles, to hold this doctrine as the Goſpel, the Word,

               <p>The objection we have now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is ſuppoſed to come, not only from Deiſts, but alſo from all thoſe nominal chriſtians who reject, <hi>altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> the Suretiſhip of Chriſt. As Deiſts deny the authority of the Bible, and as the others pay but little homage to it's divinity, I have hitherto avoided the impertinence of quoting that Book
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1242700400:114"/>
in a way of proof. When arguing with ſuch perſons, it is neceſſary to meet them upon their own ground,—the light of nature.</p>
               <p>The objections which follow, come from a different people—people who admit, <hi>in part,</hi> the Suretiſhip of Chriſt; and who profeſs a greater reverence for the Word of God. The queſtion, therefore, and the medium of proof, are both changed. In the former caſe, the queſtion was, Can divine Juſtice admit of a Surety to act and ſuffer for ſinful men? In the preſent caſe, this is granted; and the queſtion is, What was the ſinner's Surety bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form? The former queſtion was argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ground of common ſenſe; but this is to be determined by the word of God.

Since Chriſt has obeyed the law, as well as ſuffered its penalty, in order to give us a title to happineſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are under no obligation to glorify God for his mercy!</p>

                  <q rend="inline">"<hi>THE holineſs of Chriſt's heart and life, in conformity to the moral law, was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary qualification of his own perſon—it qualified him for the work he came to finiſh as our ſubſtitute, but it was not the very work itſelf.</hi>"</q>

               </p>
               <p>If Chriſt had not been made under the law to fulfil it as our ſubſtitute, his conformity to it could not have been a neceſſary qualification of his own perſon: Immanuel would have been perfectly holy in heart and life, if he had never been bound to obey thoſe precepts which are proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to <hi>meer creatures</hi>—to <hi>men—ſinful</hi> men. Therefore when the incarnate God was made under the law, it was <hi>to redeem;</hi> not to <hi>qualify</hi> himſelf for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming. Thus the objection ſeems
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1242700400:122"/>
to form a flat contradiction to the word of God. To ſet this in a clearer light, let us conſider (1) The law to which Immanuel conformed: (2) His conformity to this law: (3) The dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the perſon who thus conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this law.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The law to which our divine Surety conformed, is the very ſame law which his people were under. <q rend="inline">"He was made under the law, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them that were under the law."</q> The moral law may indeed be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the one law unto all God's reaſonable creatures, in reſpect of the principle from which obedience ſhould proceed, namely, <hi>Love.</hi> But ſtill this law has different forms, according to the different natures, and alſo accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different circumſtances of thoſe to whom it is given: ſo that, in ſome reſpects, the law given to Angels,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1242700400:123"/>
and the law given to men, will be different. It will not be ſaid unto Angels,—<q rend="inline">"Honour thy father and thy mother."</q> Nor yet, <q rend="inline">"Thou ſhalt not commit adultery."</q> Such precepts as theſe are not adapted to their nature.—Again: The moral law will differ alſo according to the different circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of creatures of the ſame ſpecies. I ſhall mention two remarkable inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this, which caſt conſiderable light upon the queſtion before us.—The firſt is that remarkable difference in the moral duties of men, which is cauſed by the entrance of Sin. The precept, <q rend="inline">"Thou ſhalt love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelf,"</q> although it be the ſame precept both before and after the fall; yet it <hi>now</hi> binds us to do many things which would not have been our duty, if we had never ſinned. For inſtance: If we had not ſinned, this
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1242700400:124"/>
precept would only bind us to love the Righteous; for we and all our neighbours would have been of that deſcription; but ſince we have ſinned, this ſame precept binds us to love the unrighteous; for we and all our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are (at leaſt by nature) of this character.—Another important differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the moral law, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the circumſtances of thoſe to whom it is given, is the difference between this law conſidered only as a rule of life, and conſidered as preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition of acquiring happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This is not a fanciful but a real and important difference; and the perſons to whom I now ſpeak, will admit it. They know that all men are by nature under this law as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the terms and condition of acquiring happineſs; but the believer in Jeſus has a title to glory independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1242700400:125"/>
of his own obedience; and he conforms to the law only as a rule of conduct.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are to conſider Chriſt's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to this law. And here we muſt obſerve, (1) Chriſt was made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, not before, but after the entrance of ſin;—not when it bound man to love none but the righteous; but when it bound us to love ſinners. (2) Chriſt's conformity to the law was conſtant and univerſal; that is, he <hi>continued</hi> in <hi>all</hi> things that are written in the book of the law to do them. (3) His conformity to this law was properly <hi>obedience;</hi> that is, ſubmiſſion to its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. This is plainly taught us when we are told that He was made <hi>under the law;</hi> for that expreſſion always imports the authority of the law over its ſubjects. To which we muſt add, (4) Chriſt was not only
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1242700400:126"/>
bound to obey this law, as a rule of life, but in order to merit the reward of obedience. This is what the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures uſually intend by the phraſe, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Under the law;</hi>"</q> and there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for underſtanding it differently when we are informed that Chriſt was <hi>made under the law.</hi> Upon the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we have every reaſon for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the words in their uſual ſenſe; for, while he was fulfilling every jot and tittle of the law, we ſee him, not in the ſtate of enjoying, but of merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reward; and he obtained it DECAUSE he had loved righteouſneſs and hated iniquity.<note n="c" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider now the Dignity of the Perſon who thus obeyed the law. He is not a meer creature, like thoſe upon whom this law is binding. He is the independent Jehovah.<note n="d" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Jer. 33. 16.</bibl>
                  </note> True, he has
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1242700400:127"/>
clothed himſelf in human nature; but he is the ſame perſon ſtill. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who made the world; who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports all things by the word of his power; whoſe ſovereign will is the ſupreme law of the univerſe,—this is the PERSON who was made under the law—a law adapted to <hi>creatures—meer</hi> creatures—creatures naturally below Angels, and made far lower ſtill by ſin!—This is the PERSON who <hi>obeyed</hi> this law—who obeyed it as dictating the terms and condition of acquiring happineſs! And ſhall we ſay, If He had not ſubmitted to this as our ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, He muſt have done ſo as his own perſonal qualification? Far be it!—Had man continued in his original purity, and had our Creator been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to appear in our nature, his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would, no doubt, incline him to love his imperfect image in ſinleſs
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1242700400:128"/>
man: But this love would not be <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to the moral law: His appearing in human nature would not bring him ſo upon a level with his creatures, that we might conſider God and man as <hi>neighbours</hi> bound by the ſame precept, and upon the ſame condition, to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love. Therefore, when Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel was made under the law, it muſt be that he might obey it as our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute.</p>
               <p>This argument acquires additional weight when we conſider our divine Surety as made under the law after the entrance of ſin. We have obſerved that the holineſs of Immanuel would incline him to love his own image in <hi>ſinleſs</hi> man; but it would be perfectly conſiſtent with his holineſs to deteſt the whole human race after they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſinners; and therefore, to love ſinful man in conformity to the moral
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1242700400:129"/>
law, could never be eſſential to the holineſs of our incarnate God. To what end then was he made under it? Why muſt he fulfil every jot and tittle of this law? Why muſt he do this in ſuch a low, obſcure, laborious, and ſorrowful ſtate? Why muſt he ſpend thirty years of his life in doing little elſe? Why muſt he do this in the form of a ſervant working for a reward? Why!—Becauſe he was made under the law to redeem them that were under it.</p>
               <p>Altho' the objector cannot prove his point without refuting the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing argument, yet I am at liberty to ſay, that this argument is not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the doctrine I contend for; I mean, it is not ſo eſſential as that the truth of the doctrine depends upon it.—If it were not blafphemy I might grant, for ſake of argument, that the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1242700400:130"/>
incarnate God could not be holy if he had not been made under the moral law—if he had not obeyed that law in the manner in which we have ſeen he did obey it; yet it would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from hence that he did not obey this law for us; that is, as our Surety, and in our ſtead; for, ſince this law could have had no claim upon him if he had not been made man,—ſince he was made man upon our account,—and ſince his obedience is of infinitely greater merit than that of all the elect put together; therefore no good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be given why he might not obey this law for himſelf (if ſuch a thing could be neceſſary) and for us alſo. This <hi>alone</hi> is a ſufficient anſwer to the objection: Yet we muſt remind the reader of what was ſaid before, and that we by no means give up the former argument; for although holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1242700400:131"/>
was eſſential to our Redeemer's Sacrifice, the obedience he yielded to the law was not eſſential to his own perſonal holineſs: he would have been perfectly holy if he had never been made under the law, or bound to obey its precepts in the manner in which he did obey them.</p>

If obedience to the divine precepts, as a condition of life, as well as ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the curſe of a broken law, are not both required of the damned; it is becauſe their caſe is hopeleſs—they are utterly rejected, and ſhut up in eternal deſpair.</p>
               <p>Now I know of no other caſe but theſe two, wherein the law does not make a double demand; and theſe are, each of them, eſſentially differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from the caſe of Chriſt and his people. In the firſt of the two caſes mentioned, the law does not demand the perſonally righteous to ſuffer its penalty, becauſe they have not ſinned: In the ſecond caſe, the law does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the damned to obey its precepts as a condition of life; becauſe the proſpect of a reward is totally cut off from them: But the caſe of Chriſt and his people ſtands thus;—They have
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1242700400:135"/>
ſinned, yet they do not ſuffer the penalty: They have not perfectly obeyed the commandments, yet they obtain the reward due to perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. This difference is of ſuch a nature as to demonſtrate the fallacy of the reaſoning in the objection. To ſee the truth of this, let us take (1) the caſe wherein the law does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ſuffering of its penalty; and (2) that wherein it does not demand obedience to its precepts as a condition of happineſs; and let us reaſon from each of theſe caſes to that of Chriſt and his people. In the firſt inſtance the argument will ſtand thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The law does not require thoſe to ſuffer its penalty, who have obeyed its precepts and</hi> NEVER SINNED; <hi>therefore it cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our Surety to obey its precepts and ſuffer its penalty, altho' we</hi> HAVE SINNED!—In the ſecond inſtance the argument
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1242700400:136"/>
runs thus: <hi>The law does not require the damned, upon whom the penalty is inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to obey its precepts as a condition of life, becauſe</hi> NO REWARD OF OBEDIENCE IS GIVEN OR HELD OUT TO THEM; <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the law cannot require our Surety to ſuffer its penalty and obey its precepts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though</hi> THE REWARD OF OBEDIENCE IS GIVEN TO US!—A man who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee into the fallacy of this reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I can only ſay of him, that his caſe is lamentable. Others, it is hoped, will ſee, that, ſince the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of the damned, and the reward of the righteous, are both found in the caſe of a Chriſtian, therefore the work of his Surety muſt comprehend what anſwers to each; that is, the <hi>penalty</hi> and the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of the law. If not, it is evident that the eternal law muſt be made void in one reſpect or other. If our Surety had not ſuffered
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1242700400:137"/>
for our ſins; and if, nevertheleſs we were to eſcape the wrath to come; it could no longer be ſaid, <q rend="inline">"The wages of ſin is death."</q> And if the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the law are not obeyed for us, and that perfectly, and yet if we obtain the reward of perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; where ſhall we find the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to which this reward is promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? <note n="*" place="bottom">I ſpeak to men who are not vain enough to ſay, that they themſelves have yielded this perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. This is the language of that law concerning which it is ſaid,—Till heaven and earth paſs, one jot or one tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the law, till all be fulfilled.<note n="†" place="bottom">That this is ſpoken of the commandments of the moral law, cannot be diſputed without great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs; as is plain from all that follows in the chapter. <bibl>Mat. 5.</bibl>

               <p>Some things in this objection have been already conſidered, viz. what is ſaid about Immanuel <hi>qualifying</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in holineſs by his obedience to the moral law; and alſo what is ſaid of his obedience to the law as an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</hi> I mention theſe particulars now, only to make other parts of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1242700400:160"/>
objection more plain to the Reader; for I find that many perſons who read the book referred to above, do not underſtand the Author, upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in hand. The <hi>Argument</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the objection, ſhall be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed preſently; but I ſhall firſt make a few obſervations upon the <hi>ſentiment</hi> which that argument is intended to ſupport.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This ſentiment, underſtood in the moſt favourable light, will ſtand thus:—Chriſt did not begin to act as the Surety or Subſtitute of his people, until about the time of his <hi>death:</hi> his foregoing obedience and ſufferings were not ſubſtitutional, but intended for our example, and for his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal qualification: but in his death he ſuffered the penalty, and alſo obeyed the commandments of the moral law, as his people's ſubſtitute and in their
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1242700400:161"/>
ſtead. And if we aſk, How could he obey the commandments of the moral law in his <hi>death?</hi> the anſwer is,—In his death he manifeſted the perfection of love to God and man, which is the end of the commandment and the fulfilling of the law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This appears to me to be a very dangerous ſentiment. It ſeems to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſo near the Truth, and it is ſupported (in ſome inſtances) by ſuch plauſible reaſoning, and by ſo able an Advocate, that thoſe who are weak in the Faith are in danger of being carried away by it.—But the Good Shepherd has ſaid,—My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; and they ſhall never periſh; neither ſhall any pluck them out of my hand.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This ſentiment is, I ſuppoſe,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1242700400:162"/>
perfectly <hi>new.</hi> It is no new thing, indeed, to deny that Chriſt fulfilled the commandments of the moral law in his people's ſtead; but it is of <hi>late</hi> that we have been told he did this in his death only, and not in his life. I cannot ſpeak with abſolute certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon the <hi>novelty</hi> of this ſentiment; but am of opinion that it was not thought of until the cloſe of the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Century. It has not, however, come too late to find footing in the world; for it ſeems to be adopted by ſeveral congregations in north and ſouth Britain, and perhaps it may give birth to another denomination of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="4">4. At times I fancy I underſtand this ſentiment pretty clearly; but at other times I find myſelf rather at a loſs. This uncertainty is owing to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples upon which this ſentiment is
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1242700400:163"/>
ſometimes deſended, and from which it's Advocates reaſon in order to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what they call the common popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar doctrine: for, theſe principles ſeem to me as inconſiſtent with their own doctrine, as with that which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. For inſtance,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt's obedience to the law is ſet before us as an <hi>example</hi> for us to copy after, which ſhews <hi>(they</hi> ſay) that he did not obey this law as our ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, in his <hi>life.</hi>—Now theſe ſame people know that Chriſt's obedience in his <hi>death</hi> is alſo ſet before us as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to copy after; how then can <hi>they</hi> believe that he obeyed this law even in his death <hi>as our ſubſtitute?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They tell us that if Chriſt had obeyed the law for us in his life, it would have ſuperſeded his expiatory ſufferings. Strange!—But, waving all other remarks, what is the reaſon that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1242700400:164"/>
Chriſt's vicarious obedience to the law in his life, ſhould ſuperſede his expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſufferings; and yet his vicarious obedience to the law in his death, ſhould <hi>not</hi> ſuperſede them?—To this it has been replied,—<q rend="inline">"His fulfilling the law for us in his death, includes his expiatory ſufferings, and therefore cannot ſuperſede them."</q> But this anſwer leaves me juſt where I was. To tell me that, <hi>The ſuffering of the penalty is included in Chriſt's vicarious obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the precepts of the law,</hi> is not to ſhew me <hi>the uſe and neceſſity of this;</hi> which is the thing I am inquiring after. It is the opinion of the Objector, that if Chriſt had obeyed the precepts of the law in his life as our ſubſtitute, then his ſufferings, conſidered as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory, would be ſuperfluous. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this is his opinion, and ſeeing he profeſſes to believe that Chriſt did
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1242700400:165"/>
obey theſe precepts <hi>for us</hi> (that is, as our ſubſtitute) in his death, I am at a loſs to conceive what neceſſity <hi>he</hi> finds for the ſufferings of Chriſt, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as expiatory.</hi> To tell me that his obedience to the law in his death, includes his expiatory ſufferings; is only to provoke a repetition of the queſtion—Why?—why muſt this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional obedience include expiatory ſufferings? Or, ſeeing this obedience does in fact include theſe ſufferings, how is it that the former does not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the latter ſuperfluous?</p>
               <p n="3">3. When we plead for our Suretie's vicarious obedience and ſufferings all through his life even unto death; the Objector tells us, that it is impoſſible to ſhew where the law makes this <q rend="inline">"<hi>double demand.</hi>"</q> He inſiſts upon it that the law has not a double demand, but an alternative, requiring either
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1242700400:166"/>
perfect obedience, or elſe the ſuffering of its penalty.<note n="*" place="bottom">I have conſidered this ſentiment before, and mention it in this place only to point out the Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor s inconſiſtency.</note>—This way of talking makes it very difficult to underſtand what theſe people intend to admit. One would think that what is here ſaid, makes as much againſt their own ſentiment, as it does againſt ours; and when they are reminded of this, their explanation only tends to involve their ſentiment in complicated obſcurity. When we tell them that their own ſentiment, alſo, infers a double de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the law upon the ſinner's Surety, they ſeem inclined to admit that it does ſo; but not <hi>ſuch</hi> a double demand as we plead for: and they ſay that the double demand which they admit, may be reduced to a <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi> one. Upon this I would obſerve.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) If they realy intend to admit
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1242700400:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that Chriſt did, at any time, living or dying, not only bear the curſe, but alſo ſulfil the precepts of the law <hi>as our ſubſtitute;</hi> this is the double de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand we plead for. The difference between the life and death of Chriſt, affects not the queſtion concerning a <hi>double</hi> demand of the law; for it is not length of time, but the two things demanded which conſtitute the <hi>double</hi> demand. If our Surety had <hi>only</hi> to obey the precepts, or if he had <hi>only</hi> to ſuffer the penalty of the law, this would be but a <hi>ſingle</hi> demand, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had been bound thus to obey, or elſe to ſuffer, all through life even unto death; and upon the other hand, if he was bound to obey, and alſo to ſuffer for us, this is a <hi>double</hi> demand, although he had thus obeyed and ſuffered only in the hour of death.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) When they talk of reducing
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1242700400:168"/>
what they ſeem to admit, to a <hi>ſingle</hi> demand, I am altogether at a loſs to know their method of doing ſo. If I were acquainted with their method of reducing, I could try it upon my own view of this doctrine; but as I do not, my ſentiment muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as it is.

But whatever obſcurity may attend this ſentiment in other reſpects, one thing is plain, viz. It ſtands oppoſed to the belief of our Suretie's having acted in our name all through his ſtate of humiliation,—from the time he was made under the law to redeem, until he ſaid,—<hi>It is Finiſhed.</hi> I am not ſure, indeed, from whence <hi>they</hi> date the commencement of his ſubſtitutional work,—<hi>when</hi> he finiſhed the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which (according to them) is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to his own perſonal quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and <hi>when</hi> he began the other righteouſneſs unto which our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is directly aſcribed: but their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeems to confine the latter to his death; meaning thereby. I ſuppoſe, the whole of his voluntary ſufferings, from the time he was nailed to the croſs, until his reſurrection. Taking the ſentiment in this view, we are
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1242700400:170"/>
now to conſider the main argument upon which it reſts, It is ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The ſcriptures do not aſcribe our juſtification directly to what Chriſt did through the whole courſe of his life, but always to what he did in his death."</q> To this we reply,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The inſpired writers do indeed, and that very frequently, aſcribe our juſtification and ſalvation to what Chriſt did in his death; and, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his death as the <hi>completion</hi> of his ſubſtitutional undertaking, it would be ſtrange if they did not aſcribe our juſtification to it. But when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired writers aſcribe our juſtification to the death of Chriſt, how does it appear that they intend to <hi>exclude,</hi> as <hi>ſubſtitutional,</hi> his foregoing obedience and ſufferings?</p>
               <p>To aſcribe ſalvation in all it's parts to the death of Chriſt, and to believe,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1242700400:171"/>
at the ſame time, that Chriſt acted as our Surety all through his ſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, are not ſuch inconſiſtent things as to render it impoſſible for an accurate ſpeaker or writer to do both. Indeed I do not know an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of any note, who held the doctrine I contend for, but what does, nevertheleſs, aſcribe our ſalvation to what Chriſt did in his <hi>death.</hi> I ſhall give a few inſtances out of many:<list>

               <p>Now it is well known that theſe Authors had no intention to <hi>confine</hi> the Suretiſhip of Chriſt to his death It is well known that they conſidered Chriſt as the ſubſtitute of ſinners all through his ſtate of humiliation; yet they aſcribe ſalvation in all it's parts to his <hi>death,</hi> in language-<hi>as ſtrong</hi> as that uſed by the Apoſtles.—The intelligent reader will readily perceive how far I intend this argument ſhould go. I have no thoughts of ſupporting any
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1242700400:173"/>
doctrine by human authority; and therefore I do not quote theſe Authors to that end. It is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent if they are allowed to be men who knew how to expreſs their own thoughts with propriety of ſpeech, and that they have actually done ſo upon this occaſion. And why ſhould not this be admitted? They conſidered the <hi>death</hi> of Chriſt as the <hi>completion</hi> of his vicarious work, and in this view they aſcribe ſalvation to it. Is this to expreſs their own thoughts improperly? I ſuppoſe no one will ſay ſo. What does this prove? It proves that to aſcribe ſalvation to the death of Chriſt, does not amount to a denial of his having acted as our ſubſtitute all through his ſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation; and conſequently, when the Apoſtles aſcribed ſalvation to his death, it does not prove that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1242700400:174"/>
to exclude, as ſubſtitutional, his foregoing obedience and ſufferings.—I may here remind our oppoſers of what certain of their <hi>own</hi> poets have ſaid, and which they themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly ſing, viz.<q>
                     <l>" Tis <hi>finiſhed</hi>—THIS <hi>his dying groan</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>" Shall ſins of every kind atone:</l>
                     <l>" Millions ſhall be redeem'd from death</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſoner who ſhould attempt to prove from this verſe, that the poet who made, or that the perſons who ſing it, conſider nothing in the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt, as ſubſtitutional, but his dying groan, and laſt expiring breath, would ſerve the poet, and thoſe who adopt his words, as ſome men do the apoſtles.</p>

which are cloſely connected with that in hand, aſcribe effects to the <hi>death</hi> of Chriſt, which belong alſo to the whole of his humiliation, obedience, and ſufferings.

               <p n="3">3. When the ſcriptures aſcribe ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the <hi>death</hi> of Chriſt, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:1242700400:177"/>
be with a view to exclude, as ſubſtitutional, his foregoing obedience and ſufferings, becauſe it is impoſſible to find an adequate cauſe or end for this obedience, or for theſe ſufferings, (eſpecially ſome of them) without admitting that they were ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. For inſtance: What adequate cauſe or end ſhall we find for his dreadful ſufferings in the garden, and from thence to Calvary, if we deny that they were ſubſtitutional? Was it merely for the ſake of ſetting us an example, and qualifying himſelf in holineſs, that he began to be ſore amazed, and very heavy? that his ſoul was exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death? that he was in an agony, and ſweat great drops of blood falling to the ground? that he was taken from hence, bound, ſmitten, ſpit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, blindſolded, mocked; ſtripped
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:1242700400:178"/>
and ſcourged?—If the Objector ſhould admit that theſe inſtances of ſuffering were ſubſtitutional, he muſt then abandon his argument, and be reduced to the neceſſity of begging the queſtion: for theſe ſufferings were no more undergone <hi>on the tree,</hi> than were any other ſufferings of our Redeemer's life. And it muſt be noticed, that the Apoſtles not only aſcribe our ſalvation to his laſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and <hi>death,</hi> but alſo expreſſly to what he endured while hanging on the Tree.<note n="g" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Gal. 3. 13.</bibl>
                  </note>—But if the Objector ſhould go ſo far as to deny that the ſufferings of Chriſt in the garden, and from thence until he was led forth to be crucified, were ſubſtitutional, he ought to provide a good reaſon for ſo doing; which, I am perſuaded, is abſolutely impoſſible. I conclude, therefore, that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1242700400:179"/>
when the ſcriptures aſcribe our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to the <hi>death</hi> of Chriſt, it is not with any intention to exclude, as ſubſtitutional, his foregoing obedience and ſufferings.</p>
               <p>But the Objector has not only ſaid that the ſcriptures always aſcribe our juſtification to the <hi>death</hi> of Chriſt, but alſo that they never aſcribe it, directly, to his foregoing obedience and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. We have therefore now to conſider what authority he has for this part of his argument. In doing this, I ſhall (1) lay before the reader ſome paſſages of ſcripture which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to aſcribe our ſalvation to the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of Chriſt <hi>in general;</hi> and (2) make ſome further obſervations upon the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of our divine Surety.</p>

account they give of what they ſaw and heard:—this was in the garden of Gethſemane. I do not poſitively affirm that all his nightly prayers were attended with <hi>equal</hi> ſorrows; but this I know, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks in a <hi>general</hi> way, when he tells us of the ſtate of mind in which our High Prieſt offered up his prayers and ſupplications. When he tells us they were offered up with <hi>ſtrong crying and tears,</hi> he does not appear to be ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what was done on ſome one particular occaſion; but he ſeems to be ſpeaking, in general, of what he did <hi>in the days of his fleſh.</hi> Moreover, theſe prayers and ſupplications which our High Prieſt offered up, with ſtrong crying and tears, were a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Prophecy;</hi> and they are ſpoken of as being offered up, <hi>day and night, inceſſantly.</hi> Thus the Redeemer weeps:

                  </q> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe memorable words, I would make the following remarks: (1) We are ſure that Jeſus is the ſpeaker. (2) This bitter complaint cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer meerly to the ſcene in Gethſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, becauſe that ſcene took place at <hi>night;</hi> and the complaint is, <q rend="inline">"O my God, I cry in the <hi>day-time.</hi>"</q> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it refer <hi>only</hi> to what Jeſus ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered on the Croſs, becauſe he was taken down from the Croſs <hi>before ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet;</hi> and the complaint is, <q rend="inline">"I cry in the day-time, and in the <hi>night-ſeaſon.</hi>"</q> (4) This complaint cannot well be <hi>confined</hi> to any one particular day and night, becauſe the words are more properly expreſſive of daily, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſorrow:—<q rend="inline">
                     <hi>O my God, I cry unto thee</hi>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:1242700400:194"/>
                     <hi>in the day time, but thou heareſt not, and in the night ſeaſon, and am not ſilent.</hi>"</q> This way of ſpeaking calls to our mind what the Evangeliſts tell us of his continuing whole nights in prayer, on mountains and in ſolitary places; and of this being his uſual cuſtom. (5) It appears from this <hi>ſecond</hi> verſe of the twenty-ſecond Pſalm, that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer had occaſion, more than once, to uſe the words of the <hi>firſt</hi> verſe, viz. My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me, &amp;c. We have juſt now mentioned ſome conſiderations which go to prove that the complaint uttered in the <hi>ſecond</hi> verſe, cannot be <hi>confined</hi> to the awful ſcene in Gethſemane; nor yet to that on the Croſs; and if the <hi>ſecond</hi> verſe cannot be thus confined, no more can the <hi>firſt,</hi> as may appear from hence: The two verſes ſeem to be cloſely connected together, and to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1242700400:195"/>
form <hi>one</hi> complaint:—<q rend="inline">"My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? why art thou ſo far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?

Let it be far from chriſtians to contradict their Lord in any thing; and eſpecially when his ſufferings are in queſtion. When he intimates, in any particular inſtance, that he ſuffered for our ſins; the leaſt we can do is to acknowledge that he did ſo.</p>

4. And being made perfect, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues the Apoſtle) he became the Author of eternal ſalvation.—<hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made perfect:</hi> this is juſt the form of expreſſion which we might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, if, as we maintain, the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle had been ſpeaking of our Great High Prieſt, as gradually advancing, all through the days of his fleſh, in the great work of Atonement. Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the ſufferings of his life in this light, it was natural to add,—<hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made perfect.</hi>—Our Great High Prieſt was made perfect by his laſt ſufferings on the Croſs, where, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own words, he <hi>Finiſhed</hi> his work. Being thus made perfect, he became the Author of eternal ſalvation to all them that obey him. By this one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified. There is no need of repeating this ſacrifice,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1242700400:197"/>
like thoſe which were offered under the law: (for then muſt he often have ſuffered <hi>ſince the foundation of the world;)</hi> but now once, in the end of the world, hath he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf. And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment, ſo Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins of many; and unto them that look for him ſhall he appear, the ſecond time, without ſin, unto ſalvation.—I ſhall conclude what I have to ſay upon the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of Chriſt, in the words of WITSIUS: not with any view to ſtrengthen the argument by the authority of his Name; but becauſe he expreſſes my own views more clearly, perhaps, than I could have done myſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I remember to have learned," ſays he, "in the communion of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed church, to the following effect:
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1242700400:198"/>
1ſt. That the death, wherewith God threatned man for ſin, comprizes in its whole extent all that miſery, which, by the juſteſt deſpleaſure of God, has followed upon ſin, and to which the ſinner man is obnoxious all his life, the principal part of which conſiſts in the want of the favour of God, and in the keeneſt ſenſe of the divine curſe, to be chiefly inflicted, when it ſhall ſo pleaſe God. 2dly, That Chriſt, by the interpoſition of his engagements for the elect, took upon himſelf all that curſe, which man was liable to, on account of ſin; hence it was, that, in order to the payment of the debt he engaged for, he led a life, in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed human nature, ſubject to many viciſſitudes of miſery, juſt like the life of a human ſinner. 3dly, That, as God uſes much forbearance with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſinners, and moderates the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1242700400:199"/>
bitterneſs of life with ſome ſweetneſs of patience, till the day of vengeance, and of the retribution of his righteous judgment, when the whole weight of the curſe ſhall light upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſinner; ſo alſo Chriſt, when in the form of ſinful fleſh, had not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame ſenſe of the painful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the ſins that were laid upon him, but ſometimes rejoiced in an eminent mixture of favour; till the hour and power of darkneſs came, when, being called to the bar, he had every thing dreadful to undergo. 4thly, That as the death, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the ſeparation of the ſoul and body, is inflicted on the ſinner man, as the fad effect of the wrath of God; ſo in like manner Chriſt underwent the ſame death, that, in this reſpect alſo, making ſatisfaction to divine juſtice, he might remove all the curſe
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1242700400:200"/>
of that death from the elect. 5thly, In fine, that as all thoſe miſeries, taken together, are what ſin deſerves; ſo Chriſt, who, by his engagement, took upon himſelf all the debt of the elect, did, by all theſe miſeries, to which he was ſubject all his life, ſatisfy divine juſtice; ſo that, taken all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they conſtitute the ranſom, which was due for our ſins.—All the ſufferings which Chriſt endured both in ſoul and body, through the whole courſe of his life, conſtitute his one and perfect ſatisfaction; though it be certain that thoſe were the moſt greiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſufferings with which he encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred on the laſt night and day; and that what he bore in his body, were far exceeded by thoſe that oppreſſed his ſoul: juſt as the whole of Chriſt's moſt holy obedience is imputed to us for righteouſneſs, tho' he gave an
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1242700400:201"/>
eminent demonſtration of it, when he was obedient in death."</q>—We come now,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> to make ſome further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of our Divine Surety. I do not intend to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fully into the conſideration of this glorious Subject: if I had ability ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch a taſk, my limits would not admit of it. All that I intend is, to propoſe one argument more, taken from what the Scriptures ſay of the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt, in reply to the Objection now before us.</p>
               <p>The Objector will not admit that Chriſt obeyed and ſuffered, all through his life upon earth, as the Surety or Subſtitute of ſinners. He cannot find, he ſays, that the Scriptures aſcribe our juſtification directly to what Chriſt did in his life, but always to what he did in his death.—In reply to this we
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1242700400:202"/>
have ſhewn (1) that when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures aſcribe our juſtification to the death of Chriſt, it is not with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to exclude, as ſubſtitutional, his foregoing obedience and ſufferings: (2) That the Scriptures do, in many places, aſcribe our juſtification and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the ſufferings of Chriſt in general; that is, to <hi>all</hi> the ſufferings he endured in the days of his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. To theſe conſiderations we have now to add, (what we have before proved) that our juſtification is aſcribed, and that "<hi>directly,</hi>" to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. This alone, one might imagine, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to decide this queſtion. But the Objector has found out a new way to evade the force of this argument. Hitherto, the queſtion has been—Is the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt (includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſufferings) the immediate and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1242700400:203"/>
direct cauſe of our juſtification? This queſtion being decided in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the diſpute was ended. The reaſon was, there exiſted no diſpute about what was meant by the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt. It was admitted upon all hands, that the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, is his conformity to the Rule of Righteouſneſs; or in other words, the whole of his obedience to the Moral Law. For men had not as yet learned to diſtinguiſh between his obedience to the precepts of the moral law in his life, and his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the precepts of the moral law in his death, and to aſſign different kinds of influence to this obedience in the juſtification of the ungodly. But by the help of theſe diſtinctions, the Objector can admit, in words, that our juſtification is aſcribed directly to the Rightcouſneſs of Chriſt and yet
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1242700400:204"/>
deny that it is directly<note n="*" place="bottom">The Reader muſt impute the frequent repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word "<hi>directly,</hi>" to the ſingularity of the ſentiment I am oppoſing.</note> aſcribed to the holineſs of his heart and life, in conformity to the moral law.<note n="†" place="bottom">If the Reader doubts whether this be a fair re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſentation, let him read the Objector's own words, page <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap> of this Eſſay.</note> So that it is not enough for us to prove that the ſcriptures aſcribe our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation directly to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; we muſt alſo prove that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is the whole of his conformity to that Rule of Righteouſneſs under which he was made:—which, one would think, is ſo ſelf evident, that it does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and that it hardly admits of proof. It is almoſt like attempting to prove, that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is—the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. And perhaps ſome Readers may
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1242700400:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>
blame me for ſaying any more upon a ſubject which is already ſo plain. Such as are thus minded, may here cloſe the book. To others, we ſhall propoſe the following remarks:—</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Righteouſneſs of which we ſpeak, is the Righteouſneſs of CHRIST. It is not the Righteouſneſs of the Eternal WORD, conſidered <hi>only</hi> as God, and as the Governor of the World; but it is that Righteouſneſs which this Perſon wrought in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, after he was made of a woman, and <hi>while he was under the Law.</hi> It is that Righteouſneſs of his which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a <hi>perfect conformity to every jot and title of the Law.</hi> If it be aſked,—Is every action of his life from his birth to his death, included in this Righteouſneſs? I anſwer directly, YES. Upon which I fancy I hear ſome exclaim,—What! did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1242700400:206"/>
to the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law as our Subſtitute? Did he work miracles as our Subſtitute?—Yes, <hi>in ſo far as his confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the</hi> MORAL <hi>Law was concerned in theſe things.</hi> When he attended to the ceremonial law, he did ſo in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the command of God; which is not a ceremonial, but <hi>moral</hi> duty.<note n="a" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>1 Cor. vii. 19.</bibl>
                  </note> And while he wrought miracles, he was going about doing good;<note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Acts x. 38.</bibl>
                  </note> which is alſo a <hi>moral</hi> duty.—But the moral law never bound <hi>us</hi> to obſerve the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial law: it never bound <hi>us</hi> to work miracles!—True; but it bound us to obey God, and to do good to man; and it is only in this ſenſe that we conſider the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt as concerned in Ceremonies and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.—Indeed theſe things are very inconſiſtently objected to us, by the perſons we now ſpeak to. <hi>They</hi> alſo
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1242700400:207"/>
profeſs to believe that Chriſt obeyed the moral law as our ſubſtitute. And how do they ſay he did this?—By dying to redeem loſt ſinners.—But the moral law never commanded us to perform ſuch a work as this! This was the greateſt miracle of all! Yet if any one was to object this to them, they would, and very juſtly, conſider it as an impertinent cavil. At leaſt they would know how to anſwer it; and one anſwer will equally ſuit us both. Neither party need be afraid if the only thing that can be objected to us is, that Chriſt obeyed the law for us in a different, and far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent manner, than could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from us:—this is our Glory. The Righteouſneſs of our Divine Surety does not exceed that which was demanded of the Elect, more than his <hi>Perſon</hi> exceeds their perſons.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1242700400:208"/>
But who ever objected to the Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt, meerly upon account of the excellency of his Perſon? Yea, I have heard one man, and only one, go thus far. <q rend="inline">"I cannot admit the doctrine of imputed righteouſneſs," he ſaid, "for this reaſon;—The works of an <hi>Infinite</hi> Perſon, cannot be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to one that is finite."</q>—But this ſeems to proceed upon a miſtaken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nature of that imputation of which we ſpeak. It is indeed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any finite perſon ſhould perform the works which are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to one who is infinite. And as the judgment of God is always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth, it is equally impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he ſhould <hi>ſo</hi> impute the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt unto us, as to judge that this Righteouſneſs is our own <hi>perſonal</hi> work. This therefore is not what the ſcriptures teach, neither
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1242700400:209"/>
is it what any chriſtian pleads for.—But it was not impoſſible for the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word, who is an infinite Perſon, to take on him a finite nature; to unite himſelf to his elect, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their ſurety: it was not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him, in their nature, and as their Surety to obey every jot and tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the moral law, and ſuffer its penalty; nor is it impoſſible for God to impute this unto the perſons for whom it was done; that is, it is not impoſſible for God to place it to their account, and, upon this ground, to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify them from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by their own perſonal performances. This is not impoſſible, but divinely true.—The Righteouſneſs of our Incarnate God, is <q rend="inline">"unto and upon all them that believe;"</q> but neither he who wrought, nor he who imputes this
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1242700400:210"/>
Righteouſneis, nor they unto whom it is imputed, ever miſtake it for the workmanſhip of a finite perſon. It is <hi>ours</hi> becauſe it was wrought for us, and is imputed unto us; not becauſe it is our own perſonal performance. There is indeed ſuch a cloſe union between Chriſt and his elect, that, becauſe he died, roſe, and reigns, and becauſe his Righteouſneſs is divine; they alſo are repreſented as dead, riſen, reigning, and as made the Righteouſneſs of God; but they are all this IN HIM, who is their Head and Repreſentative. To obey and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>in the ſecond Adam,</hi> is one thing; and to do ſo <hi>in our own Perſons,</hi> is another.—Conſidering therefore the nature and grounds of this imputation, the infinity of the Perſon of our Surety is ſo far from making the imputation of his Righteouſneſs impoſſible, that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1242700400:211"/>
the reverſe is true: for had he been a meer creature, he could have yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no obedience to the law of God beyond what was neceſsary for himſelf: much leſs could he make reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the innumerable ſins of the whole redeemed company, and work a Righteouſneſs which ſhould be ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the demands of the law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them all. It was neceſſary, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that he ſhould be <hi>man;</hi> for otherwiſe he could neither obey the precepts nor ſuffer the penalty of the law given to man; but it was his DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINITY that gave ſufficient worth and efficacy to the whole.—There is, then, a likeneſs, and there is alſo a difference, between the <hi>Perſon</hi> of our Surety, and our perſons; and there is alſo a likeneſs and a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what the law demanded of us, and what he performed as our Surety.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1242700400:212"/>
As the children were partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf took part of the ſame: as we were under the law, he was made under it: as the law bound us to <hi>continue</hi> in <hi>all</hi> things that are written therein, he came to fulfil <hi>every jot and tittle</hi> of the law, and he <hi>always</hi> did thoſe things that were pleaſing in his Father's fight: and as we were expoſed to the righteous curſe of a broken law, ſo the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all, and he ſuffered the juſt for the unjuſt. Thus far there is a likeneſs. But mark the difference: we were mere creatures, He was the Great Creator: the obedience which the law demanded of us, was only the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of mere men: but His is the Righteouſneſs of God: becauſe we could never ſatisfy divine juſtice for our ſins, we were doomed to end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1242700400:213"/>
miſery; but he being fully able to do this, his ſufferings had an end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I think it has been proved that Chriſt <hi>ſuffered</hi> for the ſins of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not only in his <hi>death,</hi> but alſo through the whole courſe of his life; conſequently he muſt have ſtood as our Surety all that time: and if he did ſo in ſuffering the penalty of the law, why not in obeying its precepts?</p>
               <p n="3">3. I think we have alſo proved, that the Incarnate God had no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to obey the moral law for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; at leaſt not in the manner in which he did obey it all through his ſtate of humiliation; conſequently it was for us he did ſo, and not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Although the love which Chriſt manifeſted in his death, is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly included in his Righteouſneſs, and is the moſt eminent inſtance of it;
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1242700400:214"/>
yet we cannot think that this was all he intended, when he ſaid he came to fulfil <hi>every jot and tittle</hi> of the law. This expreſſion evidently includes, not only the <q rend="inline">"<hi>weightier matters of the law,</hi>"</q> ſuch as perfect love to God and man; but alſo all <q rend="inline">"<hi>the leaſt of thoſe commandments,</hi>"</q> wherein that love ſhould be expreſſed. And we find that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt does in fact anſwer to the moſt minute, as well as the moſt important duties of the law. It is univerſal, and in every reſpect perfect. Neither the greateſt nor the leaſt precept was neglected by him. He laid down his life for his brethren, in obedience to the high command of his Father, and he was ſubject to Joſeph and Mary,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Luke, 2. 51.</bibl>
                  </note> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the fifth precept of the law. And it ſhould be obſerved that he did
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1242700400:215"/>
all this <hi>becauſe</hi> it was eaſier for heaven and earth to paſs away, than for <hi>one tittle</hi> of the law to fail.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt's obedience to the law was not only <hi>univerſal,</hi> but <hi>conſtant.</hi> Nor was this unneceſſary; for although this law could have had no dominion over him, if he had not been made under it to redeem; yet, after he was made under it, he was bound to obey it in all points, and to <hi>continue</hi> his obedience unto the end. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that Chriſt did in obedience to this law, is <hi>eſſential</hi> to his <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. I think it muſt be granted that the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt, taken in the moſt proper and complete ſenſe of the word, includes the whole of his obedience, from his infancy to his death; and why ſhould we underſtand it as intending any thing ſhort of this,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1242700400:216"/>
when our juſtification is aſcribed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to it. But,—</p>
               <p n="7">7. We call upon the Objector to produce one ſingle text of ſcripture, wherein the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt muſt neceſſarily be underſtood as not including the <hi>whole</hi> of his conformity to the moral law, or eternal rule of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this Eſſay in the words of DR. J. OWEN.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"I cannot but judge it ſounds ill in the ears of all Chriſtians," ſays he, "That the obedience of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt as our Mediator and Surety unto the whole Law of God, was for himſelf, and not for us; or that what he did therein, was not that he might be the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth;—eſpecially conſidering, that the ſaith of the church is, That
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1242700400:217"/>
he was given to us, born to us; that for us men and for our ſalvation he came down from heaven, and did, and ſuffered what was required of him."</p>
                  <p>"It is ſaid, <hi>That this obedience was neceſſary as a</hi> QUALIFICATION <hi>of his Perſon, that he might be</hi> MEET <hi>to be a mediator for us; and therefore was for himſelf.</hi>—But this I poſitively deny. The Lord Chriſt was every way <hi>meet</hi> for the whole work of Mediation, by the <hi>ineffable union</hi> of the <hi>Human Nature</hi> with the <hi>Divine,</hi> which exalted it in dignity, honour, and worth, above any thing, or all things that enſued thereon. For hereby he became in his whole Perſon the Object of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip and Honour; for <q rend="inline">"<hi>When he bringeth the Firſt Begotten into the world, he ſaith, And let all the Angels of God worſhip Him.</hi>"</q> Again, That which is
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1242700400:218"/>
an <hi>effect</hi> of the Perſon of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor as conſtituted ſuch, cannot be a <hi>Qualification</hi> neceſſary unto its conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
                  <p>"Whereas therefore he was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made man, nor of the poſterity of Abraham for himſelf, but for the Church, namely, to become thereby the <hi>Surety of the Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative</hi> of the whole, his obedience as Man unto the Law in general, and as the Son of Abraham unto the law of Mofes, was for his people, and not for himſelf; it was ſo deſigned, ſo performed, and without a reſpect unto the Church, was of no uſe unto himſelf. <hi>He was born to us,</hi> and <hi>given to us, lived for us,</hi> and <hi>died for us; obeyed for us,</hi> and <hi>ſuffered for us,</hi> that <hi>by the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of one, many might be made Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> This was the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and this is the Faith of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1242700400:219"/>
ſhe Church. And what he did <hi>for</hi> us, is <hi>imputed to us.</hi> This is included in the very notion of his <hi>doing it for us,</hi> which cannot be ſpoken in the true and proper ſenſe, unleſs what he ſo did, be <hi>imputed unto us.</hi> And I think men ought to be cautious that they do not, by <hi>diſtinctions</hi> and ſtudied <hi>evaſions</hi> for the defence of their own private opinions, ſhake the foundations of the Chriſtian Religion. And I am ſure it will be eaſier for them, as it is in the proverb, to wreſt the club out of the hand of Hercules, than to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſes the minds of true Believers of this perſuaſion, viz, That what the Lord Chriſt did in obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God according unto the Law, he deſigned in his love and grace to do it for them. He needed no obedience for himſelf, he came not into a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of yielding obedience, for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1242700400:220"/>
but for us; and therefore for us it was, that He fulfilled the Law in obedience unto God, according unto the terms of it. The obligation that was on him unto obedience, was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally no leſs for us, no leſs needful unto us, no more for himſelf, no more neceſſary unto him, than the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was on him as the Surety of the Covenant, to ſuffer the penalty of the Law, was either the one or the other." Which may be illuſtrated thus: "When the Apoſtle Paul wrote thoſe words unto Philemon concerning Oneſimus (ver. 18.) <hi>If he hath wronged thee,</hi> dealt unrighteouſly or injuriouſly with thee, <hi>or oweth thee ought,</hi> wherein thou haſt ſuffered loſs by him, put it on my account, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it all unto me; I will repay it, or anſwer for it all: He ſuppoſes that Philemon might have a double action
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1242700400:221"/>
againſt Oneſimus, the one of wrong or injury, the other of loſs or debt: If he hath <hi>wronged thee, or oweth thee ought.</hi> Hereon he propoſeth himſelf, and obligeth himſelf by his expreſs obligation, <hi>I Paul have written it with my own hand,</hi> that he would anſwer for both. Hereby he was obliged in his own perſon to make ſatiſfaction unto Philemon; but yet he was to do it for Oneſimus, and not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf."</p>
                  <p>"Some of the ancients diſputed, That the Son of God ſhould have been incarnate, although man had not ſinned and fallen; but none of them once imagined, that he ſhould have been ſo made man, as to be made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, and be obliged thereby unto that obedience which he hath performed: But they judged that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately he was to have been a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1242700400:222"/>
Head unto the whole Creation. For it is a common notion and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of all Chriſtians, (but only ſuch as will ſacrifice theſe notions to their own private conceptions,) That the obedience which Chriſt yielded unto the law on the earth, in the ſtate and condition wherein he did yield it, was not for himſelf, but for the Church, which was obliged unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience, but was not able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it."</p>
