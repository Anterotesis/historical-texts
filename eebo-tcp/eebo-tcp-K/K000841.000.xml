            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>IT is fluid in any degree of heat between 30 and 160 of Fahrenheit's thermometer.</p>
               <p>In a leſſer heat it freezes, in a greater it coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</p>
               <p>Coagulation is a ſeparation of an animal or vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table matter from the water in which it was diſſolved; and is at the ſame time a change of the properties of that matter, rendering it inſoluble in water again by commixture alone.</p>
               <p>The ſerum conſiſts chemically of a coagulable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and water in which common ſal ammoniac and phoſphoric ammoniac, and generally common ſalt, and frequently ſelenites, and fixed ammoniac, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; but it is a queſtion, whether the water che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically combined in the ſerum is alſo united with thoſe neutral ſalts, or whether the ſerum, and the ſolution of theſe, are only diffuſed through one another.</p>
               <p>It is probably in itſelf colourleſs, and inodorous; but it receives a yellowiſh or browniſh hue from the putreſcent part of the blood, and acquires a ſmell from the eſſential oil.</p>
               <p>If it contained no neutral ſalts, it would be inſipid, and incapable of ſtimulating.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0167700500:5"/>
               <p>The ſuperfluous water may be ſeparated from it by filtration in the body, but that which is chemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally combined with the other parts cannot.</p>
               <p>All the water may be evaporated from it by a leſſer heat than 140 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer, if it be expoſed to the air. The other parts remain after this operation ſolid, and ſoluble again in water by commixture alone.</p>
               <p>The ſeparation or addition of ſuperfluous water does not affect its viſcidity, ſo far as that is of any conſequence in the circulation; but the ſeparation of that water which is in chemical combination, may render it more viſcid.</p>
               <p>The water in chemical combination is never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, while the ſerum is contained in the blood-veſſels; and of conſequence this part of the blood is always equally viſcid, ſo far as its viſcidity can affect the circulation or ſecretions.</p>
               <p>It may be coagulated by acids, oils, alcohol, &amp;c. but no ſubſtance can get into the blood-veſſels in a ſufficient degree of concentration to coagulate it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting by injection.</p>
               <p>It may be coagulated by a juice ſecreted in the ſtomach.</p>
               <p>It has ſeldom, if ever, been found coagulated in the body.</p>
               <p>The only perceptible difference which has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the coagulable part of the ſerum, from any obſervation hitherto made public, is, that ſometimes in coagulating its parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> adhere more or leſs firmly, and that ſometimes it is of a deeper or lighter brown colour.</p>

               <head>PROPERTIES of the COAGULABLE LYMPH.</head>
               <p>IT is a compound of water and a coagulable matter.</p>
               <p>As long as it continues in the courſe of circulation, it is fluid in any degree of heat between 30 and 120 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer.</p>
               <p>When it is taken out of the blood-veſſels, it coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates; whether it be in motion or at reſt, expoſed to the air or not, or in the heat of the human body, or in any other degree of heat.</p>
               <p>If it be retained in a blood-veſſel, it continues fluid for more than three hours in any degree of heat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 30 and 120 of Fahrenheit's thermometer, and that whether it be in motion or at reſt. The ſmaller the blood-veſſel, the longer it continues fluid.</p>
               <p>It has hardly ever been found coagulated in the blood-veſſels of a living animal, unleſs they have been enlarged into aneuriſms or varices.</p>
               <p>It has generally been found coagulated in the large veſſels of the human body on diſſection, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeparated from the other parts; but to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance theſe coagulations have almoſt always taken place after death.</p>
               <p>When it is taken out of the blood-veſſels, it may be prevented from coagulating, by ſaturating the whole blood with common, ſea-ſalt, and perhaps by ſome of the other neutral ſalts.</p>
               <p>Although the coagulable part of the ſerum and coagulable lymph have different properties, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulum formed from both is pretty nearly the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0167700500:7"/>
               <p>The coagulum may be diſſolved in water by boiling or putrefaction; and may be united with concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated acids, with cauſtic alkalis, and calcarious earth, and with ſome metallic ſalts, into a ſubſtance ſoluble in water: but none of theſe can get into the ſyſtem by abſorption, ſo as to produce this effect.</p>
               <p>Both the ſuperfluous water and ſerum are capable of being ſeparated from the coagulable lymph, by fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration in the body.</p>
               <p>When the blood is received into a proper veſſel, the coagulation of this part gives an appearance of ſolidity to the whole: but ſoon after the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes thus apparently ſolid, part of the ſerum, of the ſuperfluous water, and of the water which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined with the coagulable lymph, ouzes out from the whole maſs, and brings along with it part of any extraneous fluid that may be contained in the blood-veſſels; leaving behind what is commonly called the red globules, the coagulum of the coagulable lymph, and any ſolid particles that may have been in the blood. This is called the ſpontaneous ſeparation.</p>
               <p>When the arteries are acting ſtrongly, whether the whole habit be ſtrong or not, the coagulable lymph is more fluid, and longer in coagulating. Of conſequence it lets the red particles, which are the heavieſt part of the blood, fall down towards the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, before it coagulates: and upon the ſpontaneous ſeparation, the coagulum is divided into two parts; the upper, conſiſting of the coagulum of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulable lymph alone (which has in this caſe been called the buff); the under, conſiſting partly of this, and partly of the red particles.</p>
               <p>Although part of the coagulable lymph would ſeparate from the red particles, may be prevented by taking the blood from a ſmall veſſel, or from a ſmall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0167700500:8"/>orifice, or by letting it run along the ſkin before it falls into the veſſel into which it is received, or by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it into a veſſel whoſe ſurface is large in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its contents; as in all theſe caſes the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulation is forwarded. On the other hand, if it ſtagnate in the blood-veſſel for ſome time before it is taken out, there will be a ſeparation, when none would otherwiſe have happened.</p>
               <p>Whether the coagulable lymph ſeparates in part from the red particles, or not, it coagulates ſometimes into a firmer, ſometimes into a looſer maſs, generally in proportion to the ſtrength of the ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>All the ſubſtances which coagulate the ſerum, have the ſame effect on the coagulable lymph; but none can be applied to it in the blood-veſſels, excepting by injection in a ſufficient degree of concentration to coagulate it.</p>
               <p>The coagulable lymph is probably in itſelf colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, inſipid, inodorous, and incapable of ſtimulating.</p>
               <p>Whilſt it remains in the blood-veſſels, it is che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically combined with a certain proportion of water, from which it cannot be ſeparated but by coagulation; neither will it combine with a larger proportion.</p>
               <p>Water mechanically mixed with it has no effect on its viſcidity, ſo far as that affects the circulation or ſecretions.</p>
               <p>No other differences beſides thoſe already taken notice of are obſervable in its properties.</p>
               <p>The coagulable lymph and ſerum are both capable of putrefaction, and are converted by it into a muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous matter, not coagulable by any of the methods recited above.</p>
               <p>If this mucilaginous matter ſhould undergo a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther putrefaction, it emits a foetid vapour, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into ſaline ſubſtances and calcarious earth.</p>

               <head>PROPERTIES of the RED PART.</head>
               <p>UPON viewing this part of the blood with a deep magnifier in the ſolar microſcope, as it circulates in the blood-veſſels of a living animal, it appears to be divided into a number of ſmall particles, which are apparently annular, and exceedingly flexible.</p>
               <p>While the animal is reſpiring, and the blood cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating, it is of a ſcarlet colour in the arteries, and of a Modena red in the veins; but if the reſpiration be ſtopped, that blood which circulates afterwards through the lungs continues of a Modena red. If it be taken out of the veins, kept moiſt, and expoſed to reſpirable air, it becomes of a ſcarlet colour; if it be taken out of the arteries, and covered from the air, or if it ſtagnate in them, its colour is changed to a Modena red. A light ſhade of Modena red is not ſcarlet, neither is a deep ſcarlet a Modena red. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious other ſubſtances alter the colour of this part.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to have a ſweetiſh taſle, to be inodorous, and void of ſtimulus.</p>
               <p>Its ſpecific gravity is but a very little more than the ſerum or coagulable lymph.</p>
               <p>It is more inflammable than the other parts; and, on performing its chemical analyſis, it yields a large proportion of empyreumatic oil.</p>
               <p>It is readily ſoluble in water, but not in the ſerum.</p>
               <p>It is not ſoluble in a ſaturated ſolution of neutral ſalts.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0167700500:10"/>
               <p>It is capable of undergoing the putrefactive fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, the firſt ſtage of which breaks it down into ſmaller particles, and renders it of a dark colour. It afterwards is converted into a mucilage, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſoluble in the ſerum.</p>

               <head>Of the PUTREFACTION of the BLOOD.</head>
               <p>FErmentation is the converſion of one compound into another, by a new arrangement or manner of combination of its elements.</p>
               <p>What is commonly called putrefaction conſiſts of two fermentations, which we ſhall call by the names of the firſt and ſecond ſtage.</p>
               <p>All animal ſolid and fluids may be reduced by the firſt into a mucilaginous maſs, ſoluble in water, and diffuſible through any quantity of it.</p>
               <p>The red part of the blood firſt breaks down into ſmaller particles, before it is formed into a perfect mucilage.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſtage takes place without any effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſtage converts this mucilage into earths, and ſalts, a foetid vapour, and fixable air.</p>
               <p>The firſt and ſecond ſtage of putrefaction take place in a ſmall part of the blood, or it is deſtroyed by ſome other operation; for</p>
               <p>After having coagulated the ſerum, if we ſqueeze out the water, and evaporate it, there is left a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilaginous matter ſimilar to that formed by putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>The ſails formed in the blood-veſſels, excepting phoſphoric ammoniac, may be formed by the laſt ſtage of putrefaction; and thoſe formed by the laſt ſtage are found in the blood-veſſels, excepting nitrous ſelenites, and nitrous ammoniac.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0167700500:12"/>
               <p>This mucilage, and theſe ſalts, are always carrying off by urine; the preſent blood is always diminiſhing, and die veſſels require a freſh ſupply from the food.</p>
               <p>The blood is always in the moſt powerful cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of putrefaction; which are, a heat of 98 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer, fluidity, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate expoſure to air, and motion: but it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from petrifying by the action of the veſſels; nor can any ferment or other circumſtance induce the fermentation, till this action is altered, except per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the introduction of chyle intermixed with putrid matter.</p>
               <p>In diſeaſes, the firſt ſtage often takes place in part of the blood; the ſecond ſtage ſometimes, although ſeldom.</p>

               <head>Of DIGESTION.</head>
               <p>DIGESTION is the converſion of the food into chyle, and afterwards into blood.</p>
               <p>The food may conſiſt of farinaceous or muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous vegetable ſubſtances, or native vegetable acid, or ſugar, or expreſſed oil, or animal ſolids, or animal fluids containing a mucilaginous matter.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſubſtances may be digeſted, if they be taken ſingly, or if they be mixed together.</p>
               <p>The blood formed does not differ ſenſibly in its properties, whether the one or the other of them be uſed ſingly, or ſeveral of them together; provided the organs of digeſtion be ſufficiently powerful convert them into blood.</p>
               <p>If the food be ſolid, it is generally broke down by the teeth, or by ſome other apparatus.</p>
               <p>But maſhing it down with water is not ſufficient to alter its chemical properties, and convert it into chyle and blood.</p>
               <p>It is mixed in the ſtomach with the watery fluids we drink, and with the mucilaginous watery fluids ſecreted by the ſalivary and other glands.</p>
               <p>It is ſometimes diſſolved in water before it is uſed: but it is often rendered ſolid by a previous prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or coagulated by a ſubſtance ſecreted in the ſtomach.</p>
               <p>Simple ſolution in water does not convert it into chyle or blood.</p>
               <p>If it be previouſly diſſolved in water, it affords leſs nouriſhment than if exhibited ſolid.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0167700500:14"/>
               <p>It is neceſſary that it remain in the ſtomach for ſome time, in order to its digeſtion.</p>
               <p>The only proceſs it can go through in the organs of digeſtion, that is capable of altering its chemical properties, is fermentation.</p>
               <p>Its fermentation is not attended with efferveſcence in a healthy ſtomach.</p>
               <p>If vegetable food be uſed, an acid is produced. This acid is deſtroyed in the duodenum by the bile.</p>
               <p>If animal food be uſed alone, no acid is produced.</p>
               <p>The ſtronger the ſtomach, and the more perfect the digeſtion, the leſe acid is formed from vegetable food.</p>
               <p>No ſtage of the putrefactive fermentation takes place, during the converſion of it into chyle and blood, if the digeſtion be perfect.</p>
               <p>The fermentation which takes place is peculiar to the organs of digeſtion, and has never been produced by any artificial means yet attempted.</p>
               <p>The fermentation which takes place in the ſtomach, forwards the ſolution of ſolid food in the watery menſtruums.</p>
               <p>Solid foods diſſolve ſooner in the ſtomach than they can be diſſolved in water in the ſame heat, by any means hitherto found out.</p>
               <p>If the ſtomach does not act properly, ſolid food remains undiſſolved; vegetable, and mixtures of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, and animal ſubſtances become more acid; animal ſubſtances putrify; a quantity of air is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; and the food is not digeſted and converted into chyle.</p>
               <p>Only that part of the food which is digeſted affords nouriſhment; the nouriſhment therefore is in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the food and the digeſtion.</p>
               <p>When food, either from its quantity or quality, cannot be digeſted, it is apt to occaſion great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0167700500:15"/>in the ſyſtem, while it is contained in the ſtomach and inteſtines.</p>
               <p>The only ſenſible alterations produced in the blood by different foods, are in its quantity; or in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of ſuperfluous water; or that ſometimes a long uſe of animal food brings on a degree of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction.</p>

               <p>The quantity evaporated depends upon the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſuperfluous water in the blood-veſſels, the heat of the air, the quantity of air applied, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction or relaxation of the veſſels from whence the evaporation takes place.</p>

               <p>THE urine, in the common ſtate of the body, is a tranſparent browniſh fluid, which upon cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has a mucilaginous matter ſeparated, capable of being rediſſolved in heat.</p>
               <p>In health, the ſeparating mucilage is generally in ſuch quantity as to remain ſuſpended in the urine after its reparation, forming what has been called the cloud.</p>
               <p>It is ſometimes totally abſent in health, but much more frequently in diſeaſes; ſometimes it is in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity ſufficiently to carry the cloud to the bottom, and form a mucous ſediment; and ſometimes it falls down in a flaky powder, and forms what bas been called a lateritious ſediment, which is commonly of a brick colour, and now and then white.</p>
               <p>This laſt appearance often takes place on the going off of acute diſeaſes; but it alſo happens in health, and while diſeaſes ſubſiſt in their full force, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly when they affect the urinary, paſſages, or parts near them.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the ſeparating mucilage is ſeparated in a powder, remains ſuſpended in the urine, and renders it turbid.</p>
               <p>After the ſeparating mucilage is ſeparated, if the urine be filtrated from it, it is tranſparent, conſiſting of water which contains a mucilage, and ſalts.</p>

               <p>The bile is formed from the blood in the ſecretory veſſels of the liver.</p>

               <p>The bile is a fluid of an oleaginous viſcidity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a ſolution of a ſolid matter in water.</p>
               <p>If the water be not evaporated from it, no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is produced on it by any heat between 32 and 112 degrees of Fahrenheits thermometer.</p>

               <p>It is ſolid in the heat of the atmoſphere, melts in a moderate degree of heat, and burns very readily.</p>
               <p>It is not ſoluble in water.</p>
               <p>It is partly ſoluble in alcohol.</p>
               <p>If the paſſage of the bile into the duodenum be ſtopt, acidities are apt to take place in the inteſtinal canal, the periſtaltic motion does not go on properly, the faeces loſe their peculiar colour and ſmell, and often acquire a more putrid foetor, and the digeſtion is hurt, but not entirely prevented.</p>

                  <p>THERE are cavities in the body, called blood-veſſels, in which the red part of the blood, the coagulable lymph, and part of the ſerum and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous water, are uſually contained.</p>
                  <p>They conſiſt of the heart, arteries, capillaries, and veins.</p>
                  <p>The heart conſiſts eſſentially of two cavities, there being two hearts, properly ſpeaking, joined, together in the human body, ſerving for two circulations of the blood; one through every part of the body, and one through the lungs.</p>
                  <p>The left ſide of the heart ſerves for the general cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and conſiſts of two cavities, the auricle and the ventricle.</p>
                  <p>The auricle is a cavity which opens into the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monary veins at one end, and into the ventricle at the other. There is a valve placed at the opening into the ventricle, which prevents any fluid from paſſing from the ventricle into the auricle.</p>
                  <p>The auricle is in part covered with muſcular fibres.</p>
                  <p>The ventricle is a cavity ſurrounded with muſcular fibres, having one opening into the auricle, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other into a pipe, called the aorta or great artery.</p>
                  <p>At the opening into the aorta, there are valves, which prevent any fluid from paſſing from the aorta into the ventricle.</p>

                  <p>The aorta is a tube which begins at the heart, and dividing into ſeveral branches, goes to every part of the body.</p>
                  <p>It does not divide at once, but branches out as it paſſes along.</p>
                  <p>When it has arrived at any part, and divided into very ſmall branches, theſe open into one another, ſo as to have a free and perfect communication every way: from theſe ariſe a ſmaller ſet of tubes, which alſo communicate in the ſame manner; and from them again ariſe a larger ſet, which have likewiſe a free communication.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſet have been called capillary, or anaſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſing arteries: the ſecond have not got a name: the third have been called capillary veins; but I would term all of them capillary veſſels.</p>
                  <p>From the third ſet ariſe tubes which terminate, in the heart, joining together as they go on towards it, and forming principally two large tubes, which open into the right auricle.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are called veins.</p>
                  <p>The veins which are ſubject to frequent compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, from the action of the muſcles, have valves which open towards the heart.</p>
                  <p>Each artery, capillary, and vein, is nearly cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical, but ſomewhat irregular in its diameter.</p>
                  <p>No muſcular fibres appear on the arteries, capilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or veins in the human body.</p>
                  <p>Theſe veſſels are all of them, elaſtic, and capable of being diſtended, ſo as to contain a larger quantity of fluid than what is neceſſary to render them cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical.</p>
                  <p>Their elaſticity is not ſufficient to overcome the weight of their ſides and keep them cylindrical, if
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0167700500:33"/>they are not filled with a fluid, excepting in that part of the aorta neareſt the heart.</p>
                  <p>When an animal is dead, and no chemical or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical change has taken place in the veſſels, the elaſticity is the ſame as when the animal was alive.</p>
                  <p>When an animal is dead, and the veſſels act by their elaſticity alone, they are incapable of contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to half the ſize they are of at their utmoſt diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuppoſing them to continue cylindrical.</p>

                  <p>This power is ſimilar to the muſcular power.</p>

                     <p>The diſpoſition to contraction in the capillaries of a particular part, or the external preſſure, may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, ſo as actually to produce a diminution of the ſize of the veſſels of that part, (notwithſtanding the action of the heart,) and by conſequence a diminution of the circulation of the blood in that part.</p>
                     <p>As the obſtruction ariſing from the meeting of the ſtreams of blood in the anaſtomoſing veſſels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the velocity with which it moves, it tends to render the circulation in a part equal, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting an increaſe or diminution of it.</p>
                     <p>As the blood is thoroughly mixed in the right ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the heart, and is diſtributed from thence to the different parts, no alteration in its attraction to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0167700500:37"/>the ſides of the veſſels can produce an increaſe or diminution of the circulation in a particular part.</p>
                     <p>It has been ſuppoſed, that a viſcidity in the fluids, or an increaſe of the ſize of their particles, often produced an obſtruction to the circulation; but this opinion has not been proved, or rendered probable, by any experiment hitherto made public: oh the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the red globules appear to be always nearly of the ſame ſize, except when they are broke down by putrefaction: the ſerum and coagulable lymph ſeldom or ever appear more viſcid than when in their common ſtate; and, if they were, their viſcidity would affect the ſyſtem equally.</p>
                     <p>The diſpoſition to contraction in the capillary veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, or the external preſſure, may be ſo much dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, as that the action of the heart continuing the ſame, the ſize of the veſſels of a part may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, ſo as actually to occaſion a greater circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of blood in that part.</p>
                     <p>If the heart be the ſole cauſe of the circulation, the only material alteration that could take place in the proportion of the circulation in the different parts, muſt depend on an increaſe or diminution of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to contraction in the veſſels, or on an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the external preſſure.</p>
                     <p>But the circulation may be increaſed in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar part, the motion of the heart continuing the ſame, by cauſes which do not diminiſh the diſpoſition to contraction of the veſſels of that part, nor increaſe the diſpoſition to contraction in the veſſels in the other parts of the body, nor produce any effect on the external preſſure.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the heart is not the ſole power which propels the fluids through the part in which the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is thus increaſed.</p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0167700500:38"/>
                     <p>The cauſes capable of increaſing the circulation in a part, are generally ſuch as tend to excite muſcular motion, and are called ſtimuli.</p>
                     <p>Some part of the body, brought into action by theſe ſtimuli, is capable of increaſing the circulation independent of the action of the heart.</p>
                     <p>The arteries are endowed with a muſcular motion, by which they may increaſe the circulation in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular part, or aſſiſt the heart in the general circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood.</p>
                     <p>The arteries at each contraction of the heart are diſtended; at each relaxation they contract.</p>
                     <p>This alternate contraction and dilatation might depend on their elaſticity.</p>
                     <p>If their contractions and dilatations depended on their elaſticity, their ſize at their utmoſt contraction in the living body ſhould be equal to that produced by a fluid injected into them, with a force capable of overcoming the reſiſtance the blood meets with in the capillary veſſels, which, in the human body, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably equal to eight feet perpendicular height of water.</p>
                     <p>But their ſize, even at their utmoſt ſtate of dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is leſs than that produced by a fluid injected into them, with a force equal to one foot perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular height of water, when the animal is dead.</p>
                     <p>Therefore their contractions and dilatations do not depend on their elaſticity.</p>
                     <p>The additional force which occaſions an increaſe of the circulation, in a particular part, muſt depend on the action of the arteries or capillaries.</p>
                     <p>As the capillaries do not contract and dilate alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, and as the direction of the blood in any one
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0167700500:39"/>of them is quite undetermined, this additional force cannot depend on the action of the capillaries.</p>
                     <p>If the arteries contracted and dilated by their elasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, no additional force could be applied from their contraction and dilatation; ſince the heart would loſe more force, in diſtending the arteries, than they would re-apply to the blood in contracting.</p>
                     <p>If the arteries, upon being diſtended by the blood thrown into them by the heart, are excited to a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular contraction, and when they have performed this contraction relax, and like the ventricle of the heart, receive the blood eaſily into them, and when they are again diſtended, are excited to a ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, they may apply an additional force to that of the heart, ſo as to promote the circulation through the whole body.</p>
                     <p>If ſuch contractions and dilatations be greater in any particular part, they will promote the circulation in that part; in as much as, when they are relaxed to a greater degree, they will ſuffer the blood to paſs through them more readily into the capillaries; and, when they contract, they will empty themſelves more thoroughly into the capillaries.</p>
                     <p>The arteries have a muſcular contraction and dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſimilar to that of the ventricles of the heart, by which they apply an additional power to that of the heart, ſo as to promote the general circulation through the whole body, and often to increaſe the proportional circulation in a particular part.</p>
                     <p>The motion of the blood is regulated by the action of the heart and arteries, and the contraction of the capillary veſſels; and theſe arc meaſured by the pulſe.</p>

                     <p>The air veſſels conſiſt of a pipe, called the trachea; one end of which opens into the throat, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates with the amtoſphere by the noſtrils and mouth; the other divides into branches which go to every part of the lungs, and whoſe ends open into ſmall cavities, or cells.</p>
                     <p>The air In the lungs is generally in motion; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which is at preſent contained in the cells, is paſſing through the trachea into the atmoſphere, or a freſh parcel is paſſing from the external atmoſphere through the trachea into the cells.</p>
                     <p>The whole of this motion is called reſpiration: when the air is paſſing in, it is called inſpiration; when it is thrown out, expiration.</p>
                     <p>When the thorax is enlarged by the action of one ſet of its muſcles, the preſſure of the external atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere forces the air into the lungs; the other ſet of muſcles which contract the thorax when put in action, force the air out of the lungs into the atmoſphere. But the preſſure of the atmoſphere on the ſurface of the body counterbalancing its preſſure on the ſurface of the lungs, neither the muſcles of inſpiration nor thoſe of expiration are aſſiſted or counteracted by it.</p>

                     <p>It is not determined whether pure inflammable air will ſerve for reſpiration.</p>

                  <p>PART of the ſuperfluous water and ſerum is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually paſſing through the ſides of the veſſels, particularly the capillaries, into the cellular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, and all the cavities of the body, ſo as to keep their ſurfaces moiſt.</p>
                  <p>It has been ſuppoſed that they paſſed through tubes appended to the ſides of the blood-veſſels; but ſuch veſſels have never been demonſtrated, nor is there any reaſon for ſuppoſing that they exiſt, excepting in the glands.</p>
                  <p>The fluids, commonly extravaſated, have been called the lymph.</p>
                  <p>It is uncertain whether it paſſes through the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental pores in the ſides of the veſſels, or by cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindrical organiſed holes; but it is moſt probable that it paſſes through organiſed holes, as the ſecretion is regular and conſtant.</p>
                  <p>The pores or veſſels it paſſes through, are called exhalants.</p>
                  <p>It is abſorbed by the lymphatics.</p>
                  <p>A lymphatic is a tube nearly cylindrical, divided by valves, ſo at to have the reſemblance of joints.</p>
                  <p>They ariſe from the cellular membrane, and cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the greateſt part of them go to the thoracic duct.</p>
                  <p>The valves allow the lymph to paſs from the cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the thoracic duct, but prevent its paſſing from the thoracic duct to the cavities.</p>

                  <p>The lymphatics in paſſing from the cavities to the thoracic duct, go through the lymphatic glands.</p>
                  <p>The ſtructure and uſe of theſe glands are not as yet aſcertained.</p>
                  <p>The thoracic duct is a tube which begins near the diaphragm, and commonly terminates in the left ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clavian vein.</p>
                  <p>At its opening into the left ſubclavian vein, there is a valve which allows the lymph to paſs from it into the vein, but prevents the running of the blood from the vein into the thoracic duct.</p>
                  <p>Some of the lymphatics terminate in veins. Theſe are ſimilar in ſtructure to thoſe which terminate in the thoracic duct.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>The contractile power of the blood-veſſels ſqueezes the lymph into the cellular membrane and cavities.</p>
                     <p>The quantity thrown out is in proportion to the force of the circulation, the fluidity of the ſubſtances contained in the blood-veſſels, or the quantity of the more fluid ſubſtances, and the degree of contraction of the capillaries and exhalants.</p>
                     <p>The joint of a lymphatic opening into a cavity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to fill itſelf from that cavity by its action as a capillary tube, the valves preventing the return of the lymph from the other part of the lymphatic. In like manner a lymphatic may fill itſelf entirely from the cavity in which it terminates, but its action as a capillary tube will not tend in the ſmalleſt degree to propel the lymph into the veins.</p>
                     <p>It is moſt probable that the joint of the lymphatic, next to the cavity, having abſorbed a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0167700500:47"/>of lymph to fill it, is ſtimulated to contract and propel the fluid into the next joint, and ſo on to the thoracic duct, or vein, in which it terminates; and having emptied itſelf, and being relaxed, it fills itſelf again from the cavity, and ſo continues to act: for there is apparently no other power in the body capable of producing a regular flow of the lymph through the lymphatics into the blood-veſſels.</p>
                     <p>For in a living animal where the veins are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting, and preſſing the blood, if one end of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary tube terminate in a vein, and the other in a cavity; and if there be no action in that tube, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting that which ariſes from its being a capillary one, or from the motion of the blood in the vein; if there be any motion in that tube after it is full, it will always be from the vein into the cavity, and never from the cavity into the vein, let the tube be of any ſize or ſhape whatever.</p>
                     <p>Further; the alternate preſſure of the lymphatics ariſing from the alternate contractions and relaxations of the blood-veſſels, or muſcles, is not ſufficiently powerful, univerſal, or equal, to produce a regular flow of the lymph through the lymphatics into the blood-veſſels.</p>
                     <p>Neither does the cellular membrane and cavities force the lymph into the lymphatics, and through them into the veins.</p>
                     <p>The extravaſation of fluids from the blood-veſſels in to the cellular membrane and cavities, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abſorption, generally take place in the above man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the coagulable lymph is thrown out by the exhalants.</p>
                     <p>When the coagulable lymph is thrown out, it moſt commonly coagulates.</p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0167700500:48"/>
                     <p>If it coagulate, it cannot be taken up by the lymha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, till it be rediſſolved.</p>
                     <p>In many caſes it rediſſolves, and is abſorbed much ſooner than it can be rendered ſoluble in water, by putrefaction when out of the body. At other times it continues in the cavity for many years.</p>
                     <p>The red part of the blood is alſo ſometimes thrown out by the exhalants. In this caſe, its particles are broke down probably by the firſt ſtage of putrefaction, and it is afterwards reabſorbed.</p>
                     <p>The ſame things may happen, if the red particles and coagulable lymph are extravaſated in conſequence of the rupture of a blood-veſſel.</p>
                     <p>In particular parts, as in the corpora cavernoſa penis, the extravaſation and abſorption is probably performed in a different manner, and by different veſſels.</p>
                     <p>All abſorbent veſſels muſt have a power of propel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the fluids into the blood-veſſels, ſufficient to overcome the force of their contraction, by which they endeavour to propel the blood out of any opening.</p>

                  <p>THE bodies of quadrupeds have a diſpoſition to maintain the ſame degree of heat nearly.</p>
                  <p>The heat of quadrupeds of the ſame ſpecies is generally the ſame, eſpecially in mankind.</p>
                  <p>The common heat of the human body in health, is ninety-eight degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer.</p>
                  <p>The heat is the ſame throughout the whole body, excepting that a cold ſubſtance applied to the ſkin diminiſhes its heat; and the heat of the blood, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a vein in an extremity that is expoſed to a cold atmoſphere, is reduced two or three degrees.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe the heat continues the ſame, whether that of the atmoſphere, or other ſurrounding bodies, be greater or leſs than ninety-eight degrees, unleſs when it produces a diſeaſe; the conſequence of which is an increaſe or diminution of the heat of the body.</p>
                  <p>The body is capable of reſiſting different degrees of external heat or cold, according to the habit it has acquired. There are inſtances of its bearing 20 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees below 0 of Fahrenheit's thermometer, with very moderate cloathing, and 115° above, without alteration.</p>
                  <p>The heat may be increaſed or diminiſhed by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in the body itſelf, eſpecially in diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>The heat has ſeldom been obſerved to be leſs than ninety-four, or more than a hundred and ten degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer.</p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0167700500:50"/>
                  <p>An increaſed action of the living power in any part, or in the whole body, increaſes the heat; and <hi>e contra;</hi> a diminution of the action of the living power, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes the heat either in quantity or degree.</p>
                  <p>Fluids rubbing againſt ſolids, or very ſmall particles of a ſolid immerſed in a fluid rubbing againſt one another, or againſt a ſolid, produce no ſenſible heat; therefore neither the friction of the blood againſt the veſſels, nor the friction of the red particles againſt one another, or againſt the veſſels, produces, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, or regulates the heat of the body.</p>
                  <p>It has not been proved, by any experiment hitherto made public, that the fermentations producing, or deſtroying the fluids, generate heat; and if it were, theſe fermentations do not go on ſo regularly, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, or conſtantly, as to produce, maintain, or regulate the heat of the body.</p>
                  <p>The heat is not at all proportion to the evapor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as a double quantity evaporated by the inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſpiration, makes no alteration in the heat.</p>
                  <p>The power which produces, maintains, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the heat of the human body in health, produces heat when the ſurrounding ſubſtances are heated to a leſs degree than 98 of Fahrenheit's thermometer, and cold, when they are heated to a greater degree.</p>

                     <p>Part capable of original motion, are called the moving parts.</p>
                     <p>In many of the parts capable of original motion, there are red fibres called muſcular fibres.</p>
                     <p>In ſome of the parts capable of original motion, no ſuch fibres have hitherto been demonſtrated.</p>
                     <p>All the parts of the body are not capable of original motion.</p>
                     <p>The muſcles, blood-veſſels, lymphatics, ſecretories of the glands, and ſkin, are capable of original motion.</p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0167700500:55"/>
                     <p>The moving parts are capable of contracting beyond that degree of contraction which would ariſe from their elaſticity.</p>
                     <p>All the actions of the body, and all the power which it exerts, depend upon the contraction of the moving parts.</p>
                     <p>When a muſcular fibre, or any other moving part, continues in action for a conſiderable time, it does not, in general, exert one continued contraction, but a number of alternate contractions and relaxations. The relaxations, when the body is ſtrong, or the whole ſtrength is not exerted, are often hardly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable; but when the habit is weak, or the whole force exerted, they become very apparent.</p>
                     <p>A contraction may however probably continue for a very long time, without any intermediate relaxation, as in a ſpaſm.</p>
                     <p>When any motion takes place in conſequence of a relaxation, it is from the elaſticity or weight of the part, or from ſome external power.</p>
                     <p>The original motions are produced by volition ideas of the mind, or certain external applications, called ſtimuli.</p>
                     <p>There muſt be the ſame intercourſe, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for ſenſation, between the moving part, and the brain, by means of the nerves, to render volition capable of exciting a motion in it.</p>
                     <p>Many of the moveable parts are incapable of being put in motion by the will.</p>
                     <p>An idea of the mind may excite a motion indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of, and contrary to the will, provided the part be connected with the brain by the nerves, as for ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                     <p>The will may acquire a power over a moving part, which it could not affect originally.</p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0167700500:56"/>
                     <p>The motions excited by the will are called voluntary motions; thoſe excited by ideas, or ſtimuli, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of, or contrary to the will, are called involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</p>
                     <p>All the parts of the human body, capable of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary motions, have red muſcular fibres.</p>
                     <p>The will and ideas are both capable of producing contractions and relaxations in the moving parts.</p>
                     <p>If the communication between the brain and a moving and irritable part, be cut off by cutting thro' the nerve, a motion may be ſtill excited in it by a ſtimulus; hence ſtimuli may excite motion without affecting the brain, and therefore all the motions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by them, are not begun in the brain, and carried along the nerves to the moving part.</p>
                     <p>If a nerve be cut through, ſo as to leave a portion of it adhering to a moving part, a ſtimulus applied to the nerve, may excite a motion in the moving part. Hence, the action of a nerve upon a part, may excite a motion in it; and the motions excited by the nerves, do not all ariſe in the brain.</p>
                     <p>If the communication between the brain and a moving part by the nerves continues, a ſtimulus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the brain may excite a contraction of the moving part.</p>
                     <p>The motions produced by the application of ſtimuli to moving and irritable parts are apparently the ſame, whether the part be connected with the brain by the nerves, or not; excepting that the motions excited, become more languid after the moving part has been ſeparated ſome time from the brain, and at laſt the power of motion in it is entirely loſt.</p>
                     <p>The ſame things are true of the motions excited by the application of ſtimuli to the nerves going to a moving part.</p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0167700500:57"/>
                     <p>Hence, it is probable, that the motions excited by the application of ſtimuli to a moving and irritable part, or to the nerve going to a moving part, do not ariſe in the brain, but immediately in the nerves, or in the part; the brain in this caſe only keeping up the life of the part, and rendering it capable of motion.</p>
                     <p>When a ſtimulus produces a contraction in a mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fibre, the force of that contraction is often far greater than the force with which the ſtimulus was applied. Therefore, when a ſtimulus excites a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is not in conſequence of a communication of the power employed in applying that ſtimulus: nay, the motion may be the very reverſe of that which would have been produced by the exertion of that power.</p>
                     <p>When a ſtimulus applied to a nerve produces a contraction in a moving fibre, it is a queſtion whether the motion is excited in the nerve, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the fibre, or produced immediately in the fibre, without any motions being excited in the nerve; for in this laſt there is often no apparent motion excited.</p>
                     <p>It has been conjectured by ſome, that the motion was communicated by a fluid flowing through the nerves as tubes; by others, that it was communicated by vibrations; and by others, that it ariſes from an elaſtic vapour ſurrounding the nerves: but none of theſe conjectures are founded on experiment, neither are any of them any ways capable of accounting for the appearances.</p>
                     <p>As the influence of a ſtimulus on a moving fibre is not occaſioned by any mechanical communication of motion, may not a ſtimulus applied to a nerve, exert its influence on a contractile fibre, without any
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0167700500:58"/>mechanical communication by any motion running along the nerve.</p>
                     <p>If the brain is not diſeaſed, and two parts of the body communicate with it by the nerves, as for ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, an application made to one of theſe parts may excite a contraction or relaxation in the other, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though none of the ſubſtance applied, be carried from the one to the other, and although no ſenſation be excited by the ſtimulus. Hence a medicine applied to one part of the body, may produce an effect upon another, although none of that medicine be carried to the part on which that effect is produced.</p>
                     <p>The effect of an application upon a part at a diſtance from that where it is made, may be the ſame which it would have produced if applied to that part; or it may be the reverſe, or totally unconnected with it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quer.</hi> May not the application in this caſe influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the diſtant part, without any communication from a mechanical motion running along the nerves of the one part to the brain, and from the brain by the nerves to the other part?</p>
                     <p>An application to one part, may produce a motion in another, although it would have had no effect, if it had been made to the part itſelf</p>
                     <p>A ſtimulus applied to a part incapable of original motion, may excite a motion in a moving part at a diſtance.</p>
                     <p>If the communication between the brain and any part of the body, by means of the nerves, be cut off, applications made to that part, will not affect the other parts, nor will applications to the other parts, produce motions in that; unleſs the nerves be cut off from a muſcle, whoſe fibres have been accuſtomed to contract at one and the ſame time, ſuch as the heart.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0167700500:59"/>In that caſe, if you ſtimulate one of theſe fibres, the whole are brought into immediate contraction; thoſe not ſtimulated, contract, to all appearance, as ſoon as the one to which the ſtimulus is applied.</p>
                     <p>As in this caſe the communication between the fibres by the nerves is cut off, and as after cutting thro' the nerves of a ſmall part of the body, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation may in time be reſtored, is there not a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of nervous influence, between the parts that are in contact, independent of the nerves?</p>
                     <p>The parts on which ſtimuli are capable of acting ſo as to produce motion, are called the irritable parts.</p>
                     <p>All the parts of the body are irritable in a ſound ſtate, excepting the bones, cartilages, and tendons.</p>
                     <p>All the parts of the body may become irritable in a morbid ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Stimuli may produce motion in a diſtant part, when applied to a part incapable of original motion; or, in other words, all the irritable parts are not moving parts.</p>
                     <p>An application that produces relaxation, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes contraction, is called a ſedative.</p>
                     <p>A ſubſtance may act on one part as a ſtimulant, on another as a ſedative.</p>
                     <p>A ſubſtance may act on one part as a ſtimulant or ſedative, and have a leſt effect, or none at all, when applied to another, although otherwiſe equally irrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Such ſtimuli are called ſpecific.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome parts upon which ſtimuli in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral produce greater effects than they do upon others.</p>
                     <p>A greater number of ſubſtances act alſo upon theſe parts.</p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0167700500:60"/>
                     <p>The membranes, ligaments, and blood-veſſels, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the heart, are incapable of being affected by any other ſtimulus but diſtention.</p>
                     <p>Some of the applications capable of affecting the moving parts, tend to deſtroy the fibres by mechanical or chemical effects; ſome of them have no mechanical or chemical power of action.</p>
                     <p>The irritability and mobility of a part may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, diminiſhed, or entirely loſt.</p>

                  <p>CUSTOM is the frequent repetition of any appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the body, capable of affecting the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible or irritable parts, or it is the repetition of any action or motion of the body.</p>
                  <p>Habit is the effect of ſuch repetition.</p>
                  <p>An application, producing a ſenſation, may have its power increaſed or diminiſhed by cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>If the mind pays particular attention to any impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, its force and diſtinctneſs is increaſed. Hence ariſes the improvement of the eye, ear, &amp;c. in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing objects in painting, tones in muſic, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If the impreſſions are very ſtrong, ſo as to excite great attention, their force is increaſed.</p>
                  <p>If the impreſſions are not attended to, their force is diminiſhed. Hence after living for ſome time near any thing producing a great noiſe, the noiſe is hardly heard.</p>
                  <p>The power of the will, in producing motion, may be increaſed by cuſtom, and diminiſhed by diſuſe.</p>

                  <p>The will, in frequently producing a motion, may not only have its power increaſed, but it is alſo capable of producing that motion with greater accuracy, and by frequent attempts may acquire a power over a moving part, upon which it has naturally little or no influence.</p>
                  <p>A motion may ariſe from a volition in conſequence of cuſtom, which was not naturally connected with it; as a man in turning in a loom does not will the motion of his hand, but of the end of the chizel.</p>

                  <p>An idea ſtrongly impreſt on the mind, is for the moſt part more powerful in exciting a motion, than one weakly impreſt.</p>
                  <p>The power of an application in impreſſing an idea, may be increaſed or diminiſhed by cuſtom, as is above deſcribed, and of conſequence the power of an idea in exciting motion.</p>

                  <p>The action of an application producing, diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or altering the mode of, contraction of a moving part, and which at the ſame time has no effect on the mind, may be increaſed or diminiſhed by cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>If it be often applied, ſo as always to produce its effect, its power, or the certainty of its action, is for the moſt part increaſed.</p>
                  <p>An application of an equal apparent force does not always produce the ſame effect. If the ſame quantity of ipecacuhan be twice exhibited at the interval of ſeveral days, it may vomit at the firſt exhibition, and not at the ſecond; or it may produce vomiting at the ſecond exhibition, and not at the firſt.</p>
                  <p>In applying medicines, which do not act as ſimple ſtimuli, their particular effect cannot be increaſed by increaſing the doſe, they being converted, into ſimple ſtimuli.

                  <p>An application frequently repeated, ſo as to produce its proper effect, often becomes more conſtant and uniform in its action, although it may become neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that it ſhould be applied in a greater degree.</p>
                  <p>If an evacuating medicine be repeatedly exhibited, it generally requires a larger doſe at the ſecond, and ſome of the ſubſequent exhibitions, to produce the ſame effect as the firſt; but if theſe produce the effect, the power of the medicine is afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>

                  <p>If an application be made in ſo ſmall a degree, as not to produce any effect, or if its effects are by any means counteracted, its power is diminiſhed or loſt.</p>
                  <p>The repeated application of ſome medicines in any circumſtance diminiſhes their powers.</p>
                  <p>All the natural powers of action in the body are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by frequent exertion.</p>
                  <p>If two or more fibres have been accuſtomed to contract together, either by the action of the will, by an idea, or by ſtimuli; or if the contraction in one of them be produced by the will, while the other is brought into action at the ſame time by a ſtimulus, the producing of a contraction in the one by an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to it alone, will produce a contraction in the other. If they be fibres of the ſame muſcle, and acted upon by a ſtimulus, this will happen after the communication with the brain by the nerves is cut off, but not otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>If, after this habit is acquired, one of theſe fibres is made to contract frequently, while the other is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from contracting, the habit is loſt or deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>If any motion, or ſtate of the body, be repeated at a particular period of time, it will often return at that period, although no other cauſe be applied but the habit acquired.</p>
                  <p>A habit may be deſtroyed by counteracting and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting its effects.</p>
                  <p>Two habits may be ſo connected, that preventing the one from taking place, may prevent the effects of the other.</p>

                  <p>The ſame cauſes may render ſleep leſs perfect, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not ſufficient to prevent it altogether.</p>
                  <p>Although reſt is not compleat at the beginning of ſleep, it has a tendency to become ſo during this ſtate of the body. In particular, all actions and contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions remaining after their cauſe has been removed, are apt to go off.</p>

                  <p>A great exertion of the powers of the body, may exhauſt the powers of die mind, and <hi>é contra,</hi> a great exertion of the powers of the mind, may exhauſt thoſe of the body.</p>
                  <p>A frequent exertion of the original power in one part of the body, tends to ſtrengthen that part, but to weaken the other.</p>
                  <p>An exertion of the original power, increaſes the loſs of fluids, and renders a greater quantity of food neceſſary. Hence animals that require a conſiderable quantity of nouriſhment when awake, may ſleep for ſeveral months without any being taken in.</p>
                  <p>A loſs of fluids generally increaſes the powers of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, excepting when they are diſordered by diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>A moderate exertion of the powers of the body, in proportion to the preſent ſtrength, powers of digeſtion, food, and ſleep, tends to ſtrengthen the whole body.</p>
                  <p>A violent or continued exertion of the original power, if it be not recruited by food and ſleep, may weaken to that degree as to kill.</p>
                  <p>A repeated exertion of the powers of the mind, tends to ſtrengthen its faculties; but at the ſame time to weaken the original power in the body.</p>
                  <p>Unleſs the body be endowed with a certain degree of ſtrength, the mind cannot exert itſelf powerfully.</p>
                  <p>Exerciſe of the powers of the body, tends to weaken the mind, except ſo far as is neceſſary to give the body the proper ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>But a moderate exerciſe of the body and mind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, tends to ſtrengthen the whole ſyſtem, ſo that by cuſtom the original power in the whole may be increaſed.</p>
