            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p n="1">1. IN the following Tract, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to comprize the Sum of what has been hitherto publiſhed, on this curious and important Subject, by Mr. <hi>Franklin,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hoadly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wilſon, Watſon, Lovett, Freke, Martin, Watkins,</hi> and in the <hi>Monthly Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines.</hi> But I am chiefly indebted to Mr. <hi>Franklin</hi> for the ſpeculative Part, and to Mr. <hi>Lovett,</hi> for the practical: Tho' I cannot in every Thing ſubſcribe to the Sentiments ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of one or the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Indeed I am not greatly concerned for the philoſophical Part, whether it ſtand or fall. Of the Facts we are abſolutely aſſured: Altho' they are of ſo ſurprizing a nature, than a man could not have aſſerted them a few Years ago, without quite giving up his Reputation. But who can be aſſured of this or that Hypotheſis, by which he endeavours to account for thoſe Facts? Perhaps the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt we have reaſon to expect here, is an high Degree of Probability.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I am much more concerned for the phyſical Part, knowing of how great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance this is: How much Sickneſs and
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0461000700:3"/>Pain may be prevented or removed, and how many Lives ſaved by this unparallel'd Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And yet with what Vehemence has it been oppoſed? Sometimes by treating it with Contempt, as if it were of little or no Uſe: Sometimes by Arguments, ſuch as they were; and ſometimes by ſuch Cautions againſt it's ill Effects, as made thouſands afraid to meddle with it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But ſo it has fared with almoſt all the ſimple Remedies, which have been offered to the World for many Years. When Sir <hi>John Floyer</hi> publiſhed his excellent Book on <hi>Cold bathing,</hi> many for a Time uſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by it. So did abundance of People by <hi>Cold Water,</hi> when it was publickly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by Dr. <hi>Hancock.</hi> The ingenious and benevolent Biſhop of <hi>Cloyne,</hi> brought <hi>Tar-Water</hi> likewiſe into Credit for a Seaſon; and innumerable were the Cures wrought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, even in the moſt deſperate and deplor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Caſes. Nor was it a little Good which was done by the Uſe of <hi>Sea-Water,</hi> after Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> had publiſhed his Tract concerning it. Indeed each of theſe did Wonders in it's turn. But alas! their Reign was ſhort. The vaſt Party which were on the other Side, ſoon raiſed the Cry, and ran them down. In a few Years they were out of Faſhion, cut of Uſe, and almoſt out of Memory: And the foul; hard named <hi>Exotics</hi> took Place again, to the utter Confuſion of Common Senſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Muſt not <hi>Electricity</hi> then, whatever Wonders it may now perform, expect ſoon
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0461000700:4"/>to ſhare the ſame Fate? And yet it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely certain, that in many, very many Caſes, it ſeldom or never fails. "I can truly ſay, (ſays Mr. <hi>Lovett</hi>) I ſcarce ever knew any who made the Trial and did not ſucceed. Not that all Diſorders will yield thereto. Neither in this any more than the common Way, will the ſame Treatment of the ſame Diſorder in different Perſons have always the ſame Succeſs." Indeed there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in Nature any ſuch Thing as an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Panacea:</hi> A Medicine that will cure every Diſeaſe incident to the human Body. If there could, Electricity would bid fairer for it, than any Thing in the World: As it takes Place in ſuch a vaſt Number of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, ſome of them ſo widely different from the others.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And yet there is ſomething peculiarly unaccountable, with regard to its Operation. In ſome Caſes, where there was no Hope of Help, it will ſucceed beyond all Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. In others, where we had the greateſt Hope, it will have no Effect at all. Again, in ſome Experiments, it helps at the very firſt, and promiſes a ſpeedy Cure: But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the good Effect ceaſes, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is as he was before. On the contrary, in others it has no Effect at firſt: It does no good; perhaps ſeems to do hurt. Yet all this Time it is ſtriking at the Root of the Diſeaſe, which in a while it totally removes. Frequent Inſtances of the former we have in <hi>Paraſlytic,</hi> of the latter, in <hi>Rheumatic</hi> Caſes.</p>
            <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0461000700:5"/>
            <p n="7">7. But ſtill one may upon the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it the <hi>Deſideratum,</hi> the general and rarely failing Remedy, in nervous Caſes of every Kind (Palſies excepted); as well as in many others. Perhaps if the Nerves are really perforated (as is now generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) the Electric Ether is the only Fluid in the Univerſe, which is fine enough to move through them. And what if the <hi>Nervous Juice</hi> itſelf, be a Fluid of this Kind? If ſo, it is no Wonder that it has always eluded the Search of the moſt accurate Naturaliſts.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Be this as it may, Mr. <hi>Lovett</hi> is of Opinion, "the electrical Method of treating Diſorders, cannot be expected to arrive at any conſiderable Degree of Perfection, till adminiſter'd and applied by the Gentlemen of the Faculty." Nay then, <hi>quantâ de ſpe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidi!</hi> All my Hopes are at an End. For when will it be adminiſtered and applied by them? Truly, <hi>ad Graecas Calendas.</hi> Not till the Gentlemen of the Faculty have more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Intereſt of their Neighbours than their own. At leaſt, not till there are no Apothecaries in the Land: Or till Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are independent of them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Therefore without waiting for what probably never will be, and what indeed we have no Reaſon to expect, let Men of Senſe do the beſt they can for themſelves, as well as for their poor, ſick, helpleſs Neighbours. How many may they r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lieve from racking Pain or pining Sickneſs, by this unexpenſive and ſpeedy Remedy? Reſtoring them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0461000700:6"/>Eaſe, Health, Strength, generally in a few Minutes, frequently in a Moment! And if a few of theſe Lovers of Mankind, who have ſome little Knowledge of the Animal Oeconomy, would only be diligent in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Experiments, and ſetting down the more remarkable of them, in order to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them to one another, that each might profit by the other's Labour: I doubt not, but more nervous Diſorders would be cured in one Year, by this ſingle Remedy, than the whole <hi>Engliſh Materia Medica</hi> will cure, by the End of the Century.</p>
            <p n="10">10. It is not impoſſible, but the <hi>Gentlemen Reviewers</hi> may beſtow a Compliment on me as well as on Mr. <hi>Lovett.</hi> If they are ſo kind, I would only beg them, not to plume themſelves upon a Diſcovery, which I have helped them to myſelf: Namely, that the following is little more than an Extract from others: I intended it ſo to be. I deſigned only to collect together the Subſtance of the moſt celebrated Writings on the Subject; and to place them in one connected View, for the Uſe of thoſe who have little Time or Money to ſpare. I only wiſh, ſome who has more Leiſure and Ability than me, would conſider it more deeply, and write a full Practical Treatiſe on Electricity, which might be a Bleſſing to Many Generations.</p>

            <head>THE DESIDERATUM: OR ELECTRICITY made PLAIN.</head>
            <p n="1">I. 1. FROM a thouſand Experiments it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that there is a fluid far more ſubtle than Air, which is every where diffuſed thro' all Space, which ſurrounds the Earth and pervades every Part of it. And ſuch is the extreme Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Velocity and Expanſiveneſs of this active Principle, that all other Matter ſeems to be only the Body, and this the Soul of the Univerſe. This we might term <hi>Elementary Fire;</hi> but that it is hard for us to ſeparate the Ideas of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Burning:</hi> Altho' the latter is in reality but a preternatural and violent Effect of the former.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is highly probable this is the general Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion in the Univerſe: From this <hi>pure Fire,</hi> (which is properly ſo called) the vulgar <hi>Culinary</hi> Fire is kindled. For in Truth there is but one Kind of Fire in Nature, which exiſts in all Places and in all Bodies. And this is ſubtle and active enough, not only to be, under the Great Cauſe, the ſecondary Cauſe of Motion, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and ſuſtain Life thro'out all Nature, as well in Animals as in Vegetables.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0461000700:8"/>
            <p n="3">3. To this effect the learned Biſhop of <hi>Cloyne</hi> obſerves, "The vital Flame is ſuppoſed to be the Cauſe of all the Motions in the Body of Man, whether natural or voluntary. And has not Fire the ſame Force to animate thro'out, and actuate the whole Syſtem of the World? Cheriſhing, heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fermenting, diſſolving, ſhining, and operating in various Manners, as various Subjects offer, to employ, or to determine it's Force? It is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in all Parts of the Earth and Firmament, tho' latent and unobſerved, till ſome Accident produces it into Act, and renders it viſible in it's Effects."</p>
            <p n="4">4. This great Machine of the World requires ſome ſuch conſtant, active and powerful Principle, conſtituted by it's Creator, to keep the heavenly Bodies in their ſeveral Courſes, and at the ſame Time give Support, Life and Increaſe to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inhabitants of the Earth. Now as the Heart of every Animal is the Engine which circulates the Blood thro' the whole Body, ſo the Sun, as the Heart of the World, circulates this Fire thro' the whole Univerſe. And this Element is not capable of any eſſential Alteration, Increaſe or Diminution. It is a Species by itſelf; and is of a Nature totally diſtinct from that of all other Bodies.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That this is abſolutely neceſſary both to feed common Fire, and to ſuſtain the Life of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, it ſeems may be learn'd from an eaſy Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Place a Cat, together with a lighted Candle, in a cold Oven: Then lute the Door cloſe, having fixt a Glaſs in the Middle of it: And if you look thro' this, you may obſerve, at one and the ſame Inſtant, the Candle goes out, and the Animal dies. A plain Proof, that the ſame Fire is needful to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain both culinary Fire and animal Life: And a large Quantity of it. Some doubtleſs pervades the Oven Door; but not enough to ſuſtain either Flame or Life. Indeed every Animal is a kind of Fire-Engine. As ſoon as the Lungs inſpire the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0461000700:9"/>Air, the Fire mingled with it is inſtantly diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thro' the pulmonary Veſſels into the Blood: Thence it is diffuſed thro' every Part of the Body, even the moſt minute Arteries, Veins and Nerves. In the mean Time the Lungs inſpire more Air and Fire, and ſo provide a conſtant Supply.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Air ſeems to be univerſally impregnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Fire, but ſo diluted, as not to hurt the Animal in Reſpiration. So a ſmall Quantity of a Liquor dropt in Water, may be friendly to an human Body, tho' a few Drops of the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, given by themſelv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, would have occaſioned certain Death. And yet you cannot conceive one Particle of the Water, without a Particle of the Medicine. 'Tis not impoſſible, this may be one great Uſe of Air, by adhering ſo cloſely to the elementary Fire, to temper and render ſalutary to the Body, what would otherwiſe be fatal to it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To put it beyond diſpute, that this Fire is largely mixt with the Air, you may make the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Experiment. Take a round Lump of Iron, and heat it to a Degree called a <hi>welding</hi> Heat: Take it out of the Fire, and with a Pair of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows blow cold Air upon it. The Iron will then as effectually melt, as if it were in the hotteſt Fire. Now when taken out of the Forge, it had not Fire enough in it to conquer the Coheſion of it's Parts: But when this Fire is join'd with that which was mixt with the Air, it is ſufficient to do it. On the ſame Principle we account for the Increaſe of a Coal or Wood Fire by blowing it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And let none wonder that Fire ſhould be ſo connected with Air, as hardly to be ſeparated. As ſubtle as Fire is, we may even by Art attach it to other Bodies; yea, and keep it Priſoner for many Years: And that either in a ſolid or a fluid Form. An Inſtance of the firſt we have in Steel: Which is made ſuch, only by impacting a large Quantity of Fire into Bars of Iron. In like Manner we

It was afterwards found, that a Glaſs Globe was on ſome Accounts preferable to a Glaſs Tube: Particularly, as it was leſs Labour to turn the one for ſome Hours together, by means of a ſmall Wheel, in the mean Time rubbing it with a dry Hand, or a little Cuſhion, than to rub the Tube for ſo long a Time.

The beſt way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare which is, to coat it with thin Lead; to line it on the inſide with Leaf-Gold, to within two Inches of the Top, and to faſten ſome Tinſel Fringe to the Bottom, (or to the End of the Wire within the Phial) ſo as to touch the Gold Lining. By this Wire going thro' the Cork, the Phial is hung on any metallic Body, which communicates by a Wire, with the Globe or Tube.

            <p n="12">12. But all Bodies are not capable of receiving it. There is in this Reſpect an amazing Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between them. The Excrements of Nature, as Wax, Silk, Hair, will not receive the ethereal Fire, neither convey it to other Bodies: So that whenever in circulating it comes to any of theſe, it is at a full ſtop. Air itſelf is a Body of this Kind; with great Difficulty either receiving or conveying this Fire to other Bodies: So are Pitch and Roſin (Excrements, as it were, of Trees). To

If any one doubt, whether it paſs thro' the Subſtance, or only along the Surface of Bodies, a ſtrong Shock taken thro' his own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, will prevent his doubting any longer. It dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from all other Matter in this, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of it repell, not attract, each other. And hence is the manifeſt Divergency in a Stream of electrical Effluvia. But tho' the Particles of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell each other, yet are they attracted by all other Matter. And from theſe thr e, the extreme ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety of this Fire, the mutual Repulſion of its Parts, and the ſtrong Attraction of them by other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ariſes this Effect, that if a Quantity of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric Fire be applied to a Maſs of common Matter of any Bigneſs or Length, (which has not already got its Quantity) it is immediately diffuſed thro' the whole.</p>
            <p n="14">14. It ſeems, this Globe of Earth and Water, with its Plants, Animals, Buildings, have diffuſed thro' their whole Subſtance, juſt as much of this Fire as they will contain. And this we may term their <hi>natural Quantity.</hi> This is not the ſame in all Kinds of Matter: Neither in the ſame Kind of Matter in all Circumſtances. A ſolid Foot of one Kind of Matter (as Glaſs) contains more of it than
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0461000700:13"/>a ſolid Foot of another Kind. And a Pound Weight of the ſame Kind of Matter, when rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, contains more than it did before.</p>
            <p n="15">15. We know that this Fire is <hi>in</hi> common Matter, becauſe we can pump it <hi>out,</hi> by the Globe or Tube: We know that common Matter has near as much of it as it can contain, becauſe if we add a little more to any Portion of it, the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Quantity does not enter, but forms a Kind of Atmoſphere round it. On the other Hand, we know that common Matter has not more of it than it can contain. Otherwiſe all looſe Portions of it would repel each other; as they conſtantly do, when they have ſuch Atmoſpheres. Had the Earth, for Inſtance, as much electric Fire in Proportion, as we can give to a Globe of Iron or Wood, the Particles of Duſt and other light Matter, would not only repel each other, but be continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="16">16. The Form of every electric Atmoſphere, is that of the Body which it ſurrounds: Becauſe it is attracted by every Part of the Surface, tho' it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter the Subſtance already replete. Without this Attraction, it would not remain round the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but diſſipate into the Air.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The Atmoſphere of an electrified Sphere, is not more eaſily drawn off, from any one Part of it than from the other, becauſe it is equally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by every Part. But it is not ſo with Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of other Figures. From a Cube it is more eaſily drawn off at the Corners than at the Sides: And ſo from the Corners of Bodies of any other Form, and moſt eaſily from the ſharpeſt Corners. For the Force with which an electrified Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0461000700:14"/>it's Atmoſphere, is proportion'd to the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face on which that Atmoſphere reſts. So a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face four Inches ſquare retains it's Atmoſphere, with ſixteen Times the Force that one of an Inch ſquare does. And as in pulling the Hairs from an Horſe's Tail, a Force inſufficient to pull off an Handful at once, could eaſily pull it off Hair by Hair: So tho' a blunt Body can't draw off all the Atmoſphere at once, a pointed one can eaſily draw it off, Particle by Particle.</p>
            <p n="18">18. If you would have a ſenſible Proof, how wonderfully pointed Bodies draw off the electric Fire, place an Iron Shot of four Inches Diameter on the Mouth of a dry Bottle. Suſpend over it a ſmall Cork-Ball by a ſilken Thread, juſt ſo as to reſt againſt the Side of the Shot. Electrify the Shot, and the Ball will be repelled four or five Inches from it. Then preſent to the Shot ſix or eight Inches off the Point of a ſharp Bodkin. The Fire is inſtantly drawn off; ſo the Repulſion ceaſes, and the Ball flies to the Shot. But a blunt Body will not produce this Effect, till it is brought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an Inch of the Shot. If you preſent the Point of the Bodkin in the Dark, you may ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at a Foot Diſtance, a Light gather upon it like a Glow-worm, which is manifeſtly the Fire it extracts from the Shot. The leſs ſharp the Point is, the nearer it muſt be brought, before you can ſee the Light. And at whatever Diſtance you ſee the Light, you may draw off the electric Fire.</p>
            <p n="19">19. To be convinced that pointed Bodies <hi>throw</hi> off, as well as <hi>draw</hi> off the Fire, you may lay a long ſharp Needle on the Shot. It cannot then be electrified, ſo as to repel the Ball, becauſe the Fire thrown upon it, continually runs off, at the Point of the Needle: From which in the Dark you may ſee ſuch a Stream of Light, as in the preceeding Inſtance.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0461000700:15"/>
            <p n="20">20. While the electric Fire, which is in all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, is left to itſelf, undiſturb'd by any external Violence, it is more or leſs denſe, according to the Nature of the Body which it is in. In denſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies it is more rare: In rare Bodies it is more denſe. Accordingly every Body contains ſuch a Quantity of it, rare or denſe, as is ſuitable to it's Nature. And there is ſome Reſiſtence to every Endeavour of altering it's Denſity, in the whole of any Body, or in any Part of it. For all Bodies reſiſt either the Increaſe or Diminution of their natural Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. And on the other Hand, when it has been either increaſed or diminiſhed, there is a Reſiſtence to it's Return to it's natural State.</p>
            <p n="21">21. With regard to the different Reſiſtence made by different Bodies, in either of theſe Caſes, it is an invariable Rule, that Glaſs, Wax, Roſin, Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, Silk, Hair, and ſuch like Bodies, reſiſt the moſt: And next to theſe, the Air, provided it be dry, and in a ſufficient Quantity. That this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence is leaſt in Metals, Minerals, Water, Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, Animals and Vegetables: Which we may rank together, becauſe the Difference in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence is very inconſiderable: And that in theſe Bodies the Reſiſtence is greater, when their Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face are poliſh'd, and extended in length, than when their Surfaces are rough and ſhort, or end in ſharp Points.</p>
            <p n="22">22. When a Body has more electric Fire forced into it, than it has naturally, it is ſaid to be elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified <hi>poſitively.</hi> When Part of the natural Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is taken away, it is ſaid to be electrified <hi>negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Now when an Iron Bar is <hi>negative'y</hi> electrified, the Fire drawn out, does not go in again as ſoon as the Experiment is over, but forms an Atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere round it, becauſe of the Reſiſtence it finds in it's Endeavour to dilate itſelf, either into the Air or into the Bar. And when it is electified <hi>poſitively,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0461000700:16"/>the ſame Kind of Atmoſphere is form'd, by the Fire accumulated upon it. Whether therefore Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are electrified negatively or poſitively, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſo when the Experiment is over, there are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar Atmoſpheres ſurrounding them, which will produce ſimilar Effects.</p>
            <p n="23">23. But we can electrify no Body beyond a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Degree: Becauſe when any is electrified to that Point, it has an Atmoſphere round it ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrong to ballance any Power that endeavours to electrify it farther. Nor is the electric Fire either from the Tube or the Globe, able to force its Way thro' this.</p>
            <p n="24">24. And in the ordinary Courſe of Nature, this ſubtle, active Fluid, which not only ſurrounds eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry groſs Body, but every component Particle of each, where it is not in abſolute Contact with it's neighbouring Particle, can never be idle, but is ever in Action, tho' that Action be imperceptible to our Senſes. It is ever varying it's Condition, tho' imperceptibly, in all Parts of all Bodies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and electrifying them more or leſs, tho' not ſo forcibly as to give ſenſible Signs of it. All Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies then, and all their component Particles, when in their natural Situation, have round their Surfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where they are not in abſolute Contact with other Surfaces, an imperceptible Atmoſphere ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ballance the ſmaller Force with which they are attack'd: Every Way ſimilar to the perceptible Atmoſphere of Bodies forcibly electrified. In theſe imperceptible Atmoſpheres is placed the Power which reſiſts their being electrified to an higher Degree than they are naturally. And this Power lies in the Elaſticity of the ſubtle Fluid, every where diſperſed both round all Bodies and in them.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0461000700:17"/>Metals are eaſily electrified. Conſequently they have rare and therefore weakly-reſiſting Atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheres. But as Heat rarefies all Bodies, ſo if Glaſs be heated to a certain Degree, even below melting, it will give as free a Paſſage to the electric Fire, as Braſs or Iron does: The Atmoſphere round it being then rendered as rare as that of Metals. Nay, when melted, it makes no more Reſiſtence than Water. But it's Reſiſtence increaſes, as it cools. And when it is quite cold, it reſiſts as forcibly as ever. Smoothly-poliſh'd Wax reſiſts as much as Glaſs. But even the ſmall Heat raiſed by rubbing, will render it's Atmoſphere as rare as that of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and ſo intirely deſtroy it's Reſiſtence. The ſame is true of Roſin and Brimſtone. Even the Heat ariſing from Friction, deſtroys the Reſiſtence which they naturally make to being electrified: A ſtrong Proof, that the Reſiſtence of all Bodies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, is exerted at their Surfaces, and cauſed by an electric Atmoſphere of different Denſities, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to different Circumſtances.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Moſt Experiments will ſucceed as well with a Globe of Brimſtone, as with one of Glaſs. Yet there is a conſiderable Difference in their Nature. What Glaſs repells, Brimſtone (as alſo Roſin) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts. Rubbed Glaſs emits the electric Fire: Rubbed Brimſtone, Roſin and Wax receive it. Hence if a Glaſs Globe be turned at one end of a prime Conductor, and a Brimſtone one at the other, not a Spark of Fire can be obtain'd; one receiving it in, as faſt as it is given out by the other. Hence alſo if a Phial be ſuſpended on the prime Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor, with a Chain from it's Coating to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and only one Globe turned, it will be elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified (or <hi>charged,</hi> as they term it) by twenty turns of the Wheel: After which it may be <hi>diſcharged,</hi> that is, unelectrified, by twenty Turns of the other Wheel.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0461000700:18"/>
            <p n="27">27 The Difference between <hi>Non Electrics</hi> (vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly ſpeaking) and <hi>Electrics per ſe,</hi> is chiefly this. 1. A <hi>Non Electric</hi> eaſily ſuffers a Change, in the Quantity of Fire it contains. It's whole Quantity may be leſſen'd by drawing out a Part, which it will afterwards reſume. But you can only leſſen the Quantity contain'd in one of the Surfaces of an <hi>Electric:</hi> And not that, but by adding at the ſame Time an equal Quantity to the other Surface. So that the whole Glaſs will always have the ſame Quantity in it's two Surfaces And even this can only be done in Glaſs that is thin: Beyond a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Thickneſs we know no Power that can make this Change. 2. The ethereal Fire freely moves from Place to Place, in and thro' the Subſtance of a <hi>Non Electric.</hi> But thro' the Subſtance of an <hi>Electric</hi> it will by no Means paſs. It freely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters an Iron-Rod, and moves from one End to another, where the Overplus is diſcharged. But it will not enter, or move thro a Glaſs-Rod. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will the thinneſt Glaſs which can be made, ſuffer any Particle of it entering one of it's Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces, to paſs thro' to the other.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Indeed it is only Metals and Liquids, that perfectly <hi>conduct</hi> (or tranſmit) this Fire. Other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſeem to conduct it, only ſo far as they contain a Mixture of theſe; accordingly, moiſt Air will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct it, in Proportion to it's Moiſtneſs. But dry Air will not conduct it at all: On the contrary, it is the main inſtrument, in confining any electric Atmoſphere, to the Body which it ſurrounds. Dry Air prevents it's diſſipating (which it does preſently when <hi>in vacuo</hi>) or paſſing from Body to Body. A clear Bot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

But exhauſted of Air, it is elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified as effectually as if it was full of Water. Yet an Electrical Atmoſphere and Air, do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clued one another. For we breath in it freely,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0461000700:19"/>and dry Air will blow thro' it, without altering it at all.</p>
            <p n="29">29. When a Glaſs Phial is electrified, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Quantity of Fire is accumulated on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Surface, an equal Quantity is taken from the outer. Suppoſe, before the Operation begins, the Quantity of Fire contain'd in each Surface, is equal to twenty Grains: Suppoſe at every Turn of the Globe, one Grain is thrown in: Then after the firſt Stroke there are twenty one within, nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen only without: After the ſecond, the inner Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face will have twenty-two, the outer but eighteen: And ſo on, till after twenty Strokes, the inner will have forty, the outer none. And the. Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ends: For no Power or Art of Man can throw any more on the inner Surface, when no more can be taken from the outer. If you attempt to throw more in, it is thrown back thro' the Wire, or flies cut in Cracks thro' the Sides of the Phial. The Equilibrium cannot be reſtored in this Phial, but by a Communication form'd between the inner and outer Surface, by ſomething external, touching both the outer, and the Wire which communicates with the inner Surface. If you touch theſe by Turns, it is reſtored by Degrees: If both at once, it is reſtored inſtantly. But then there is a Shock occaſioned by the ſudden paſſing of the Fire thro' the Body, in it's Way from the inner to the outer Surface. For it moves from the Wire to the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, (not from the Finger to the Wire, as is commonly ſuppoſed). Thence it paſſes thro' the Body to the other Hand, and ſo to the outer Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</p>
            <p n="30">30. The Force with which this Shock may be given, is far greater than one would conceive. It will kill Rats, Hens, or even Turkeys in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Others, that are not quite killed, it ſtrikes blind. It will give Polarity to a fine Needle, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0461000700:20"/>it point North and South, as if touched by a Loadſtone. It will invert the Polarity of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and make the North Point turn to the South. At the ſame Time the Ends of the Needles are fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blued like the Spring of a Watch. It will melt off the Heads and Points of Pins and Needles: And ſometimes the whole Surface of the Needle is run and appears as it were bliſter'd, when examined by a magnifying Glaſs. It will melt thin Gold or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, when held tight between two Panes of Glaſs, together with the Surface of the Glaſs itſelf, and incorporate them in a fine Enamel. Yea a ſtrong Spark from an electrified Phial, makes a fair Hole thro' a Quire of Paper doubled: Which is thought good Armour againſt the Puſh of a Sword, or even a Piſtol Bullet. And 'tis amazing to obſerve in how ſmall a Portion of Glaſs, a great Electrical Force may be. A thin Glaſs-Bubble, about an Inch Diameter, being half filled with Water, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gilt on the outſide, when electrified gives as ſtrong a Shock as a Man can well bear: Allowing then that it contains no more Fire after charging than before, how much Fire muſt there be in this ſmall Glaſs! It ſeems to be a Part of it's very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Perhaps if that Fire could be ſeparated from it, it would be no longer Glaſs. It might in loſing this loſe its moſt eſſential Properties, it's Tranſparency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Brittleneſs, and Elaſticity.</p>
            <p n="31">31. Some have not improbably ſuppoſed, that all <hi>Electric</hi> Bodies, ſo called, are by their original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, thro'ly ſaturated with Electric Fire: That it remains fixt in them, (unleſs while the Texture of thoſe Bodies is quite alter'd by Liquefaction) that Fire fixt in a Body conſtitutes an <hi>Electric,</hi> and all Bodies where it is not fixt are <hi>Non Electries.</hi> Agreeably to which they ſuppoſe that in all <hi>Non Electrics,</hi> the Original Fire, looſely inhering, is eaſily driven on by the new collected Fire, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0461000700:21"/>then poſſeſſes its Place: But that in <hi>Electrics</hi> the Original Fire being impacted into their Subſtance, and therefore more firmly inhering, will not give Way to, or be driven on by, the new collected Fire. Such is Air in particular; with the Particles of which the original Fire is cloſely incorporated. Dry Air ſeems to be ſo fully ſaturated with it, that it is ſcarce capable of receiving any more: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Let Wires be elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified ever ſo ſtrongly, yet the Moment any Part of them is touch'd by a Perſon ſtanding on the Floor, they are electrified no longer; all the Fire eſcaping thro' him into the Earth.</p>
            <p n="32">32. Upon the Principles of Electricity, we may give a more rational Account, of many Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Nature, than has yet been done: Of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Lightning in particular. In order to which we may obſerve, all electrified Bodies retain the Fire thrown into them, till ſome Non-electric ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches: To which it is then communicated with a Snap, and becomes equally divided. Electric Fire is ſtrongly attracted by Water, and readily mixes with it. And Water being electrified, the Vapours ariſing from it, are equally electrified. As theſe float in the Air, they retain the additional Fire, till they meet with Clouds not ſo much electrified. Then they communicate it with a Shock.</p>
            <p n="33">33. The Ocean is compounded of Water, and Salt; one an Electric, the other not. When there is a Friction among the Parts near its Surface, the Fire is collected from the Parts below. It is then plainly viſible in the Night, at the Stern of every failing Veſſel. It appears from every Daſh of an Oar: In Storms the whole Sea ſeems on Fire. The Particles of Water then repell'd from the electrified Surface, continually carry off the Fire as it is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.

            <p n="34">34. Particles of Water riſing in Vapours, attach themſelves to Particles of Air. One Particle of Air may be ſurrounded by twelve Particles of Water as large as itſelf, all touching it, and by more added to them. Particles of Air thus loaded would be drawn nearer together by the mutual Attraction of the Particles of Water, did not the Fire, Common or Electric, included therein, aſſiſt their mutual Repulſion. Hence they continue ſuſpended. But if Air thus loaded, be compreſs'd by adverſe Winds, or by being driven againſt Mountains, or if it be condenſed by the Loſs of it's Fire, it will continue ſuſpended no longer, but will deſcend in Dew. And if the Water ſurroun ing one Particle of Air comes into contact with that ſurrounding another, they naturally coaleſce into a Drop, and ſo deſcend in Rain.</p>
            <p n="35">35. The Sun ſupplies common Fire to all Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, riſing either from Sea or Land. Vapours having both this and Electric Fire, are better ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported than thoſe which have this only. For when Vapours riſe into the coldeſt Region, the common Fire may fail. But the Cold will not diminiſh the Electric: This is always the ſame. Hence Clouds raiſed from freſh Waters, from moiſt Earth, or growing Vegetables, more eaſily deſcend and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite their Waters, as having but little Electric Fire, to keep the Particles ſeparate from each other. So that the greateſt Part of the Water raiſed from the Land, falls on the Land again. But Clouds raiſed from the Sea, having both Fires, and much of the Electric, ſupport their Water far more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and being aſſiſted by Winds, may bring it from the Middle of the wideſt Ocean to the Middle of the broadeſt Continent. And yet a Way is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided whereby theſe alſo are readily brought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0461000700:23"/>their Water. For whenever they are driven againſt Mountains by the Winds, thoſe Mountains take away their Electric Fire: And being cold, the common alſo: Hence the Particles immediately cloſe. If the Air was not much loaded, the Water falls in Dew on the Top and the Sides of the Mountain. If it was, the Electric Fire being taken at once from the whole Cloud, it flaſhes brightly, and cracks loudly. And the Particles inſtantly coaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing for want of that Fire, fall in an heavy Shower.</p>
            <p n="36">36. When a Ridge of Mountains ſtops the Clouds, and draws the Electric Fire from the Cloud firſt approaching it, the next when it comes near the firſt, now deprived of it's Fire, flaſhes into it, and depoſites it's own Water. The third Cloud approaching, and all that ſucceed, act in the ſame Manner; as far back as they extend, which may be for ſeveral hundred Miles. Hence the continual Storms of Thunder, Lightning and Rain, on the Eaſt Side of thoſe va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t Mountains, the <hi>Andes,</hi> which running North and South, intercept all the Clouds brought againſt them from the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean. In a plain Country, there are other Means to make them drop their Water. For if an electrified Cloud coming from the Sea, meets in the Air a Cloud coming from the Land, and therefore not electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the firſt will give it's Flaſh into the latter, and thereby both will be made to depoſite their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Concuſſion of the Air contributes alſo to ſhake down the Water, not only from thoſe two Clouds, but from others near them. When the Sea and Land Clouds would paſs at too great a Diſtance from each other, they are mutually attracted till within the Diſtance. For the Sphere of Electrical Attraction is far beyond the flaſhing Diſtance. And yet where a Cloud contains much Fire, it may ſtrike at a conſiderable Diſtance. When a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0461000700:24"/>has but little Fire in it, you muſt approach very near before you can draw a Spark. Throw into it a greater Quantity of Fire, and it will give a Spark at a greater Diſtance. But if a Gun Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, when electrified, will ſtrike and make a Noiſe, at the Diſtance of an Inch, at what a Diſtance, and with how great a No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

No Wonder that this ſhould melt Metals (which our artificial Flaſh does in ſome Degree) tho' perhaps not ſo properly by it's Heat, as by inſinuating into the Pores, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating a violent Repulſion between the Particles of the Metal it paſſes thro'. This overcomes the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction whereby they cohere, and ſo melts the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallic Body. And this accounts for its melting a Sword in the Scabbard, or Gold in the Pocket, without burning either.</p>
            <p n="37">37. But Thunder Clouds do not always contain more than their natural Quantity of Electric Fire. Very frequently they contain leſs. And when this is the Caſe, when they are negatively electrified, altho' the Effects and Appearances are nearly the ſame, yet the Manner of Operation is different. For in this Caſe, it is really the Fire from the Mountains, or other Part of the Earth which ſtrikes into the Cloud; and not, as we imagine, Fire from the Cloud which ſtrikes into the Earth. And we may eaſily conceive, how a Cloud may be nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively electrified. When a Portion of Water is rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied into a thin Vapour, the Fire it contains is rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied too. Conſequently it has then leſs than it's natural Quantity of Fire. Such a Cloud therefore coming within a due Diſtance of the Earth, will receive from it a Flaſh of Electric Fire; which Flaſh, to ſupply a great Extent of Cloud, muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten contain a great Quantity of Fire. Such a Cloud alſo paſſing over Woods of tall Trees, may ſilently receive ſome Supply, either from the Points of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0461000700:25"/>Boughs, or from the ſharp Ends and Edges of the Leaves. The Cloud thus ſupplied, flaſhes into other Clouds that have not been ſo ſupplied; and thoſe into others, till an Equilibrium is produced, among all that are within a ſtriking Diſtance of each other. And hence are repeated Strokes and Flaſhes, till they deſcend in Showers to the Earth, their Original. Rain, eſpecially when in large Drops, generally brings down the Electric Fire: Falling Snow often: Summer Hail, always, tho' ſilently. Conſequently, any of theſe may prevent Thunder and Lightning; or at leaſt, abate it's Violence. Rain is helpful in another Reſpect like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. By wetting Men or Beaſts, it ſaves many Lives. For if your Cl athes are thro'ly wet, and a Flaſh of Lightning ſtrikes the Top of your Head, it will run in the Water over the Surface of your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into the Ground: Whereas if your Cl aths were not wet, it would go thro' your Body. Hence a wet Chicken cannot be killed by a Stroke from the Phial; whereas a dry one is kill'd in an Inſtant.

            <p n="38">38. Common Fire (if it be any thing more, than a different Modification of the ſame Element) is more or leſs in all Bodies, as well as Electrical. If there be a ſufficient Quantity of either in any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it is inflamed. But when the Quantity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fire therein is ſmall there needs more Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric Fire to infl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0461000700:26"/>them. If they are not, the Spark muſt be greater. Sulphureous Vapours, whether riſing from the Earth, or from Stacks of moiſt Hay or Corn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or any other heated and reeking Vegetable, contain ab ndance of common Fire.

Make a ſmall Croſs of two thin Strips of Wood, the Arms being juſt ſo long, as to reach the four Corners of a large, thin Silk Handkerchief when extended.

Tie a Silk Ribbon to the End of the Twine next the Hand; and where the Silk and Twine join, faſten a Key. Raiſe this Kite when a Thunder-Storm is coming on: But he that holds the String, muſt ſtand in a Porch, or under ſome other Covering, that the Ribbon may not be wet. He muſt likewiſe take particular Care, that the Twine do not touch the Top or Side of the Porch. As ſoon as the Thunder-Cloud comes over the Kite, the pointed Wire draws the Electric Fire from it. The Kite and all the Twine are then electrified, as plainly appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

And when the Kite and Twine being wet, conduct the Fire freely, it will ſtream from the Key, on the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Knuckle. By this Key the Phial may be charged, and all other Experiments made, as by the Globe. And this is a Demonſtration,

            <p n="41">41. It may not be improper to add one or two Obſervations, before we proceed to what is of more Importance. Scarce any Phenomenon in Nature
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0461000700:28"/>has been eſteem'd more difficult to be accounted for than thoſe luminous Appearances in the Sky, term'd <hi>Aurora Borealis,</hi> or <hi>Northern Lights.</hi> But theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may be rationally explain'd, upon the Principles of Electricity. We often ſee Clouds at different Heights, paſſing different Ways, North and South at the ſame Time. This manifeſtly proves differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Currents of Air, one of them under the other. Now as the Air between the Tropics is rarefied by the Sun, it riſes; the denſer Air preſſing into it's Place. The Air ſo raiſed, moves North and South, and if it has no Opportunity before, muſt deſcend in the Polar Regions. When this Air with it's Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours deſcends into contact with the Vapours ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, the Electric Fire which it brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be communicated, and is ſeen in clear Nights; being firſt viſible where it is firſt in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely in the moſt Northern Parts. But from thence the Streams of Light ſeem to ſhoot Souther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even to the Zenith of Northern Countries.</p>
            <p n="42">42. Another Phenomenon of a totally different Kind, may be accounted for on the ſame Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, altho' Mr. <hi>Prior</hi> ſuppoſes <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf to aſk, as a Queſtion which he could not anſwer,
<q>
                  <l>"Whence does it happen, that the Plant which well</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Allowing for Poetical Amplification the plain Fact is this. The Senſitive Plant, as it were, ſhrinks away, as ſoon as your Hand approaches it. And from a turgid and vivid Appearance, inſtantly droops and hangs it's Leaves. Now ſuppoſe this Plant to contain more Electric Fire than any other Plant or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0461000700:29"/>Animal, it muſt or Courſe communicate that Fire, to any other that touches it. And if ſo, it's Leaves and Branches muſt be in a languid State, till they have recover'd their natural Quantity. To illuſtrate this, ſet any ſmall Tree in a Pot on a Cake of Brimſtone. Electrify it and it grows extremely turgid, ſo as to erect it's Leaves. But the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you touch one of them, the whole Tree droops, and hangs all it's Leaves and Branches.</p>

But if one unelectrified is brought near, the greateſt Part of it is determined that Way; whence the Attraction of the other Parts of the electrified Body

               <p>Prop. 1. When two Bodies equally replete with Electric Matter approach each other, no Flame or Snap will enſue. P. 5.</p>
               <p>Prop. 2. Two Bodies equally electrified repel each other. P. 6.</p>
               <p>Prop. 3. An Electric Body interpoſed between a Perſon and the Earth, prevents his exciting Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity in another Body by Friction. P. 11.</p>
               <p>Prop. 4. If there is originally a certain Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Electric Matter in a Body of a given Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude and Denſity; and that Matter be equally diſtributed therein, by it's Elaſtic Force, according to the Denſity of the Parts: Upon increaſing the Quantity of Matter by adding other Bodies of the ſame Kind, the Quantity of Electric Matter will be increaſed in the ſame Proportion. P. 14.</p>
               <p>Prop. 5. As Electric Bodies act on light Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that are not electrified, ſo unelectrified Bodies act on the Electric Matter contain'd in electrified Bodies. P. 16.</p>
               <p>Let a Wire be electrified in the Dark, and if you hold any unelectrified Body 7 or 8 Inches from the End of it, a Stream of Fire will iſſue from it, which will diverge to that Body. But the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency will leſſen as it approaches it, till the Rays become parallel. If the Body be held not directly before the End of the Wire, but wide of it at about two Inches Diſtance, the Fire will deſcribe curvilinear Rays towards that Body. P. 17.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0461000700:34"/>
               <p>Hence it appears, that unelectrified Bodies act in like Manner with electrified: Only the acting Force of the one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being increaſed by Friction, is greater than that of the other.</p>
               <p>Prop. 6. When two equally Electric Atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheres are brought ſo near as to touch, they repell each other with a Force equal to their Denſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. P. 19.</p>
               <p>Prop. 7. If while a Fluid ſurrounds a Globe which is electrified and turn'd round an Axis paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thro' it's Center, an unelectrified Body be held near the Equator of it, the Fluid will riſe ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively towards that Body, as it turns round, in like Manner as the Sea is affected by the Moon.

               <p n="4">4. It ſhines like a <hi>Flame,</hi> and is emitted with a <hi>Snap:</hi> If towards a <hi>Non Electric,</hi> the Fire is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed, leſs or more, and ſo appears of a bluiſh, Purple, Yellow, or White Colour.</p>
               <p>When the Electric Fire is not ſo much condenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to explode, as in Thunder and Lightning it goes off in a dilated Stream of purple Flame, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſembling that Part of the <hi>Aurora Borealis,</hi> which appears in Streams of Light.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0461000700:35"/>
               <p>When it is little condenſed, it appears <hi>bluiſh,</hi> as all other faint Lights do: When a little denſer, it appears <hi>Purple:</hi> When denſer ſtill, it looks <hi>Yellow,</hi> like Candle Light: When highly condenſed, it is clear and <hi>white,</hi> like the Light of the Sun. So the White Lightning is of all others moſt fierce. So Phoſphorus rubb'd a little, ſpends itſelf in an harmleſs Blue Flame: But upon a greater Attriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, kindles into a White Flame, and burns with an outragious and unquenchable Fire. p. 17.</p>
               <p>And as Lightning pervades ſoft Subſtances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt, but diſſolves hard and compact Bodies, ſo Electric Fire pervades the ſoft, muſcular Parts of the Body, but violently ſtrikes the Bones and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons. Again, as thoſe denſer Parts of Lightning which we call Thunder-Bolts, ſtriking againſt hard Bodies, glance by Reflection to different Parts, ſo this Fire, ſtriking againſt the Elbow, is reflected from thence acroſs the Breaſt, to the other El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow. p. 18.</p>
               <p>Indeed different Perſons are affected thereby in a very different Manner. Some are extremely ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it, ſome not: And ſome are not ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of it at all: A Perſon, for Inſtance, who has the Small-Pox, cannot be electrified by any Means whatever. p. 20.</p>
               <p>Experiment 1. On the Axis, in the Center of my Globe, is fixt a circular String of Threads. When the Globe is at reſt, they all hang down: When it is in Motion, they all extend themſelves from the Center, ſtrait toward the inner Surface of the Globe (like the Spokes of a Coach-Wheel) which they nearly touch. Thus they continue till the Electric Virtue ceaſes, and then gradually fall down, as at firſt. p. 22.</p>
               <p>Exp. 2. While they are extended, if you move your Hand toward the Surface of the Globe, they move every Way toward the Hand. Hence we ſee
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0461000700:36"/>the amazing Subtlety of this Fire, which pervades Glaſs as readily as if nothing were in the Way.</p>

               <p>Exp. 4. If the Room be then darken'd, the Ends of the Threads on the Outſide, will be all tipt with Fire. But thoſe within are not, which ſhews that this Power acts only <hi>ab intra</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. p. 23.</p>
               <p>Exp. 5. An Iron Rod being hung on Silken Strings, with one End about ¼ of an Inch from the Globe, will at the other End (which terminates in a conical Point) emit a Purple Flame diverging every Way. Hold your Finger within ¼ of an Inch, and the Fire will iſſue more largely. p. 24.</p>
               <p>Exp. 6. Hold your Finger ſtill nearer, and the Rays will be ſo condenſed as to run to it in a Stream of Yellow Flame; which is alſo ſenſible to the Feeling, as a gentle Wind, and ſmells like the Fire of Phoſphorus.</p>
               <p>Exp. 7. If you put your Finger on the Rod, the Flame inſtantly diſappears, the Fire all running off upon the Finger. But take it off, and the Flame appears again.</p>
               <p>Exp. 8. Apply your Finger near a Tin Tube ſo ſuſpended, and you may ſee the Fire, and both hear and feel the Snap. p. 25.</p>
               <p>Exp. 14. Under an electrified Plate, put ſome Leaf-Gold or other light Subſtances on another Plate unelectrified: And it will be attracted and repell'd alternately, between the two Plates. For, each Time it touches the lower Plate, it diſcharges he Electric Fire, and ſo becomes again attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. p. 28.</p>

If to a Gun Barrel you adapt a ſmall Tin Cup, and pour in Water; a Perſon holding his Finger perpendicular over the Water, within ¼ of an Inch of it's Surface, will find the Water riſe in Form of a Cone to meet his Finger, and from the Top of it, a Stream of Fire will iſſue to the Finger and ſnap as uſual p. 30.</p>
               <p>Exp. 19. A dry Spunge is an <hi>Electric.</hi> But if it be dipt in Water, and then hung on the Barrel, put your Finger near it, and the Fire iſſues out, and the Drops which before fell very ſlowly, will now fall very faſt.

               <p>Exp. 20. A Syphon hung on the Cup, drops very gently till it is electrified; but then the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter runs in a Stream, which in the Dark is like a Stream of Fire.</p>
               <p>Exp. 21. Open a Vein in a Perſon ſtanding on the Roſin, and the Blood will fly out to a certain Diſtance. But let him be electrified, and it will ſpin out with a much greater Force, and to a far greater Diſtance.</p>
               <p>Exp. 24. If Mercury be put for Water, the Electric Force is ſomething greater, but in no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to it's Denſity.</p>

               <p>Exp. 42. If the Globe be exhauſted of Air, and then turn'd, the electric Fire will act wholly within the Globe, where it will appear (in a dark Room) as a Reddiſh or Purple Flame, filling the whole Globe. But this, as the Air is re-admitted into it, will gradually diſappear.

            <p n="5">5. A Boy about ſeven Years old (ſays Mr. <hi>Floyer,</hi> a Surgeon in <hi>Dorcheſter</hi>) was taken blind ſuddenly in both his Eyes, without any previous Pain or Fever. Three or four Days after, he was brought to me. He was as blind, as if his Eyes had been cut out. Taking the Caſe to be a perfect <hi>Gutta Serena</hi> in both Eyes, I told his Parents, it was my Opinion he would never ſee again. However I determined to try the Electric Shock: And the next Morning, faſtening a Wire coming from the Phial to his Leg, and another round his Head, I brought the Latter near the Conductor, and gave him four Shocks ſucceſſively. That Day he was put to Bed, and continued there, ſweating profuſely, till the next Morning, when he agreeably alarm'd his Father by crying out, he could ſee the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. When he was brought to me the ſecond Time, he could ſee when I put my Hand between his Eyes and the Light of the Sun. This gave me Encouragement to repeat what we had done the Day before. The next Day he could a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and dilate his Eyes; the Third Day he could diſtinguiſh Objects; the Fourth, Colours. The Fifth Day, after repeating the Experiment, his Sight was perfectly reſtor'd, and the Eyes, in every Reſpect, as well as if no Diſorder had happened to them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. From a Gentleman in <hi>Newcaſtle upon Tyne,</hi> I have the following Account. Laſt Week a poor Man in <hi>Sandgate,</hi> that had been blind twenty-four Years, was led to the Machine. I ſet him upon the Electrical Board, and drew Sparks for about twenty Minutes from the Pupil of his Eye. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had reſted himſelf a little, and was able to look up, he told us he could ſee <hi>Sidgate,</hi> which he had not ſeen for many Years before. He could alſo diſtinguiſh Objects in the Room, and was able to walk home without a Guide. He came a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0461000700:43"/>Time, and was ſo much better, that I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine he did not think it neceſſary to come any more.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He adds, About the Time I wrote laſt, a young Woman was cured of a fourteen Years Blindneſs. She was able, before ſhe went home, to diſtinguiſh one Letter from another.</p>

               <p>"I have had ſeveral in Hand, and among the reſt a Girl, about Seventeen, has been with me about three Weeks. Her Caſe is owing to a Film, or Skin, grown over her Eyes. It came by the Small-pox about twelve Years ago. Her Friends have had all the Advice, and uſed all the Means in their Power, but to no Purpoſe; except that ſhe has loſt her Left Eye irrecoverably by one of the Perſons they apply'd to.</p>
               <p>"When ſhe came to me, the <hi>Iris</hi> of the Right Eye alſo was very near covered with a very thick Skin, ſo that ſhe could do very little more than diſtinguiſh Day from Night. It was grown much worſe this Winter, and was ſo Blood-ſhot and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, that I told her Mother I could do nothing for her. However ſhe made ſuch a lamentable Complaint, that I conſented to try.</p>
               <p>"The Method I have taken, is drawing Sparks from her Eye, and ſometimes giving Shocks from her Head or Neck, down her Arm, to carry off the frequent Complaints of Pain and Dizzineſs in her Head; which never fails of ſucceeding in about ten Minutes. We have electrify'd her about half an Hour twice every Day. The Skin waſtes gradually, and grows thinner and leſs every Day;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0461000700:44"/>ſo that now the Colour of the Eye appears thro' it, except in the Middle, and towards the Noſe, where the Film at firſt ſeem'd twice as thick as the reſt. The other Day, as I had her under Hand, ſhe ſaw the Buttons of my Shirt-ſleeve, and of my Coat; and Yeſterday ſaw the Teeth of one of her Companions that was laughing at her. But her Eye is ſo weak, that I adviſe her to make very little Uſe of it yet."</p>

And the helping us in our bodily Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, was <hi>one</hi> great End it was ordained to ſerve," (probably <hi>the</hi> great End) "after it had been thus fully and plainly diſcovered to us."</p>
            <p n="53">53. It were greatly to be wiſhed, that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ulty would ſtrictly examine the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Properties, and Effects of this ſovereign Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. For ſuch it unqueſtionably is, particularly in nervous Caſes: Even in thoſe Caſes, which the common <hi>Materia Medica</hi> will in no wiſe reach. But it is not to be expected. They muſt not diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige their good Friends the Apothecaries. Neither
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0461000700:69"/>can it conſiſt with their own Intereſt, to make (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' not every Man) yet ſo many Men their own Phyſicians, which would be the unavoidable Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, if a regular Syſtem of practical Rules were formed from a Proceſs of Experiments, whereby a ſenſible Man might judge in what Caſes it would cure, and in what not: And in what Manner it might be moſt effectually applied in any Caſe wherein it was proper.</p>
            <p>In order to prevent any ill Effect, theſe two Cautions ſhould always be remembered. Firſt, let not the Shock be too violent; rather let ſeveral ſmall Shocks be given. Secondly, do not give a Shock to the whole Body, when only a particular Part is affected. If it be given to the Part affected only, little Harm can follow even from a violent Shock.</p>
            <p>For Inſtance. In a <hi>Palſy of the Tongue,</hi> the Shock may be given to the Tongue only by applying one Wire to the hinder Part of the Neck, and another to the Tongue. And if in any Caſe there be Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of too great a Shock, it may eaſily be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
            <p>It is highly probable, a timely uſe of this Means might prevent before they were thro'ly formed, and frequently even then remove ſome of the moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and dangerous Diſtempers: <hi>Cancers</hi> and <hi>ſcrophu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Tumours</hi> in particular; tho' they will yield to no other Medicine yet diſcovered. It is certain, nothing is ſo likely, by accelerating the contained Fluids, to dilate and open the Paſſages, as well as divide the coagulated Particles of the Blood, that ſo the Circulation may be again performed. And it is a Doubt, whether it would not be of more uſe, even in <hi>Mortifications,</hi> than either the Bark or any other Medicine.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude, I would beg one Thing (if it be not too great a Favour) from the Gentlemen of the Faculty, and indeed from all who deſire
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0461000700:70"/>Health and Freedom from Pain, either for themſelves or their Neighbours. It is, That none of them would condemn they know not what: That they would hear the Cauſe, before they paſs Sentence: That they would not peremptorily pronounce againſt Electricity, while they know little or nothing about it. Rather let every candid Man take a little Pains, to underſtand the Queſtion before he determines it. Let him for two or three Weeks (at leaſt) try it himſelf in the above-named Diſorders. And then his own Senſes will ſhew him, whether it is a mere Play-thing, or the nobleſt Medicine yet known in the World.</p>
