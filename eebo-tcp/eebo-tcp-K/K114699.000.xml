            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

moſt highly probable, or rather phyſically demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable, that a Comet did paſs by at that time, and was, under the Conduct of the Divine Providence, and as his Inſtrument in puniſhing a wicked World, the Cauſe of that Deluge. The only thing wanting, was, to demonſtrate from the Period of ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and its Situation in the Heavens, Aſtronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſtated and computed, that ſuch a Comet did actually come by at that very time: which if it could be once ſhewn, the whole muſt be own'd as certain, and demonſtrated, and all the natural Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollaries therefrom muſt be allow'd as true, even by the Obſtinate and Incredulous. This indeed at firſt was look'd upon by me as not at all to be expected; ſince we then barely began to know, or rather ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conjecture that Comets did revolve about the Sun in ſettled Periods, but without being able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine any one of thoſe Periods. But of late God has ſo bleſs'd the Labours of the Learned; and this Part of Aſtronomy is ſo much improv'd, eſpecially by the farther Pains and Obſervations of the great Inventor himſelf, Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton;</hi> whoſe Name will never be forgotten while Mathematicks and Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy are preſerved among Mankind; and by the laborious Calculations of the acute Dr. <hi>Halley,</hi> on the Principles laid down by the former, that what was a few Years ago almoſt deſpair'd of, is now in great Meaſure diſcover'd, and we know, not only that one Comet has come round three or four times already in later Ages, <hi>viz.</hi> A.D. 1456, 1531, 1607, and 1682, and will no doubt come round again <hi>A.D.</hi> 1758, as making its Period in about 75 Years; that another has probably come round in the ſame later Ages twice already, <hi>viz. A.D.</hi> 1532, and 1661; and ſo is to return <hi>A D.</hi> 1789, or 1790, as making its Period in about 129 Years: But, which is the greateſt Diſcovery of all, that the laſt moſt remarkable Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0591000200:3"/>
whoſe Deſcent into our Regions has occaſion'd almoſt all the modern ſolid Knowledge we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the whole Cometick Syſtem it ſelf, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſeveral times been ſeen already within the time of certain Records; I mean in the 44<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year before Chriſt, and again <hi>A.D.</hi> 531, or 532; and yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>A.D.</hi> 1106, beſides this its laſt Appearance <hi>A.D.</hi> 1680, whereby we know that it revolves in about 575 Years. This laſt Comet I may well call the <hi>moſt remarkable one</hi> that ever appear'd; ſince beſides the former Conſideration, I ſhall preſently ſhew, that it is no other than that very Comet which came by the Earth at the Beginning of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Deluge, and which was the Cauſe of the ſame. Now conſidering the Premiſes, I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have occaſion, in order to my preſent Deſign, to prove theſe five Things concerning it. (1.) That no other of the known Comets could paſs by the Earth at the Beginning of the Deluge. (2.) That this Comet was of the ſame Bigneſs with that which paſs'd by at that time. (3.) That its Orbit was then in a due Poſition to paſs by at that Time. (4.) That its deſcending Node was then alſo in a due Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the ſame Paſſage by. (5.) That its Period exactly agrees to the ſame time. Or, in ſhort, that all the known Circumſtances of this Comet do correſpond, and that it actually paſs'd by on or about that very Year, and on or about that very Day of the Year when the Deluge began. All which Things I ſhall demonſtrate in their Order.</p>
            <p n="1">I. None of the other Comets yet known, I mean of the 21 in Dr. <hi>Halley</hi>'s Table and my <hi>Solar Syſtem,</hi> could be that which paſs'd by the Earth at the Beginning of the Deluge. This appears by theſe certain Arguments following.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) None of them appear to have been of a due Bigneſs: For the Phaenomena of the Deluge, as I

            <p n="2">(2.) None of their deſcending Orbits are duly ſituate, I mean between 90 and 100 Degrees from <hi>Aries:</hi> which Poſition is yet abſolutely neceſſary in this Caſe. For the Preceſſion of the Equinox, which is about 50 Degrees, added to the 46 Degrees that the Earth was diſtant from <hi>Aries</hi> when the Flood began, muſt ſuppoſe the deſcending Orbit of the Comet to be now between 90 and 100 Degrees from <hi>Aries:</hi> at which place none of the deſcending Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of the other Comets are now ſituate; as Dr. <hi>Halley</hi>'s Table, and my Solar Syſtem grounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will readily ſhew. (3.) None of the other's Nodes are ſo ſituate, as is neceſſary to bring the Comet near enough to our Earth: I mean between 90 or 100 Degrees from <hi>Aries;</hi> and ſo as to croſs the Plane of the Ecliptick very near to the Diſtance of the Earth from the Sun; as is alſo plain from the ſame Table and Syſtem. Nay indeed, the wrong Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the deſcending Orbits, noted under the laſt Head, renders this due Situation of the Nodes plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible. For it being neceſſary, that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit it ſelf interſect the Ecliptick it ſelf in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Degree of <hi>Taurus;</hi> this cannot poſſibly be in ſuch a Situation of the Orbit, as that we have already mention'd to belong to all the reſt of the known Comets. So that theſe other Comets were utterly incapable of being inſtrumental in the Deluge, even tho their Periods ſhould any of them agree; which yet we know not that any of them do.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This Comet was of the ſame Bigneſs with that which paſs'd by at that time; I mean a very ſmall one, and only 10 times as large as the Moon. <note place="margin">

                  </hi>
               </note> This appears by Mr. <hi>Flamſteed</hi>'s Determination of its apparent Diameter, about 20″ when it was near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0591000200:5"/>
as far off as the Sun: whereas he ſuppoſes that of the Moon at the ſame Diſtance to be about 6″. So that if due Allowance be made for that large and denſe Part of the Atmoſphere, which hides the Nucleus or Comet it ſelf from us, ſuppoſe 7″, the Diameter of the ſolid Body it ſelf will be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 13″. Now the Cube of 13, or 2197, is to the Cube of 6, or 216, as about 10 to 1. Whence it appears, that this Comet is about ten times ſo great as the Moon, or ¼ ſo great as the Earth, as the real Comet that occaſion'd the Deluge ought to be.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The deſcending Part of the Orbit of this Comet was about the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> deg. of <hi>Taurus</hi> at the Time of the Deluge, as that of the Comet at the Deluge muſt have been. For this deſcending Orbit is now in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Degree of <hi>Cancer;</hi> and if we allow 46 Degrees for its apparent Motion ſince the Deluge, which is very little different from the real Preceſſion of the Equinox, the main, if not only Occaſion of it, it will appear to have been in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Degree of <hi>Taurus</hi> at that Time, according to the foregoing Computation.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Deſcending Node of this Comet, which is of the greateſt Conſideration here, and liable to the greateſt Variety of all, does alſo exceeding well agree in the preſent Caſe. For this is now in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Degree of <hi>Cancer;</hi> and if we allow, as before, 46 Degrees for its apparent Motion ſince the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, or for the real Preceſſion of the Equinox, the main, if not only Cauſe of it, it will appear to have been in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Taurus</hi> at that Time alſo. Nay, if we allow the leaſt Inequality in theſe two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or the leaſt Alteration of the Planes either of the Ecliptick or of the Comets Orbit, or of both, as we juſtly may, both from the Phyſical Cauſes, and Aſtronomical Obſervations, we may ſuppoſe them ſtill nearer the Earth's Diſtance from the Sun, and ſo more exactly ſuitable to the Caſe of the Deluge.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0591000200:6"/>
V. The Period of this Comet moſt exactly agrees to the ſame Time, I mean to 7 Revolutions in 4028 Years, the Interval from the Deluge till its laſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance 1680. <note place="margin">
