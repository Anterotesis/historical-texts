            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION in Eight Volumes in Twelves; and to the FOURTH EDITION in Octavo.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE following Hiſtory is given in a Series of Letters written principally in a double yet ſeparate Correſpondence;</p>
            <p>Between two young Ladies of virtue and honour, bearing an inviolable friendſhip for each other, and writing not merely for amuſement, but upon the moſt <hi>intereſting</hi> ſubjects; in which every private family, more or leſs, may find itſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: And,</p>
            <p>Between two Gentlemen of free lives; one of them glorying in his talents for Stratagem and Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and communicating to the other, in confidence,
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0041800508:4"/>
all the ſecret purpoſes of an intriguing head and reſolute heart.</p>
            <p>But here it will be proper to obſerve, for the ſake of ſuch as may apprehend hurt to the morals of Youth, from the more freely written Letters, that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, tho' profeſſed Libertines as to the Female Sex, and making it one of their wicked maxims, to keep no faith with any of the Individuals of it, who are thrown into their power, are not, however, either Infidels or Scoffers; nor yet ſuch as think themſelves freed from the obſervance of thoſe other moral duties which bind man to man.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, it will be found, in the progreſs of the Work, that they very often make ſuch refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon each other, and each upon himſelf, and his own actions, as reaſonable beings <hi>muſt</hi> make, who diſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not a Future State of Rewards and Puniſhments, and who one day propoſe to reform—One of them actually reforming, and by that means giving an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to cenſure the freedoms which fall from the gayer pen and lighter heart of the other.</p>
            <p>And yet that other, altho' in unboſoming himſelf to a ſelect friend, he diſcover wickedneſs enough to intitle him to a general deteſtation, preſerves a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, as well in his images, as in his language, which is not always to be found in the works of ſome of the moſt celebrated modern Writers, whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and characters have leſs warranted the liberties they have taken.</p>
            <p>In the Letters of the two young Ladies, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed will be found not only the higheſt exerciſe of a reaſonable and <hi>practicable</hi> Friendſhip, between minds endowed with the nobleſt principles of Virtue and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0041800508:5"/>
but occaſionally interſperſed, ſuch Delicacy of Sentiments, particularly with regard to the other Sex; ſuch inſtances of Impartiality, each freely, as a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principle of their friendſhip, blaming, praiſing, and ſetting right the other, as are ſtrongly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the obſervation of the <hi>younger</hi> part (more eſpecially) of the Female Readers.</p>
            <p>The principal of theſe two young Ladies is propoſed as an Exemplar to her Sex. Nor is it any objection to her being ſo, that ſhe is not in all reſpects a perfect character. It was not only natural, but it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that ſhe ſhould have ſome faults, were it only to ſhew the Reader, how laudably ſhe could miſtruſt and blame herſelf, and carry to her own heart, diveſted of ſelf-partiality, the cenſure which aroſe from her own convictions, and that even to the acquittal of thoſe, becauſe revered characters, whom no one elſe would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit, and to whoſe much greater faults her errors were owing, and not to a weak or reproachable heart. As far as is conſiſtent with human frailty, and as far as ſhe could be perfect, conſidering the people ſhe had to deal with, and thoſe with whom ſhe was inſeparably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, ſhe <hi>is</hi> perfect. To have been impeccable, muſt have left nothing for the Divine Grace and a Purified State to do, and carried our idea of her from woman to angel. As ſuch is ſhe often eſteemed by the man whoſe <hi>heart</hi> was ſo corrupt, that he could hardly believe human Nature capable of the purity, which, on every trial or temptation, ſhone out <hi>hers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides the four principal perſons, ſeveral others are introduced, whoſe Letters are characteriſtic: And it is preſumed that there will be found in ſome of them, but more eſpecially in thoſe of the chief character among the men, and the ſecond character among the women, ſuch ſtrokes of Gaiety, Fancy, and Humour,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0041800508:6"/>
as will entertain and divert; and at the ſame time both warn and inſtruct.</p>
            <p>All the Letters are written while the hearts of the writers muſt be ſuppoſed to be wholly engaged in their ſubjects (the events at the time generally dubious): So that they abound not only with critical Situations, but with what may be called <hi>inſtantaneous</hi> Deſcriptions and Reflections (proper to be brought home to the breaſt of the youthful Reader); as alſo with affecting Converſations; many of them written in the dialogue or dramatic way.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Much more</hi> lively and affecting, ſays one of the principal characters, muſt be the Style of thoſe who write in the height of a <hi>preſent</hi> diſtreſs; the mind tortured by the pangs of uncertainty (the Events then hidden in the womb of Fate); <hi>than</hi> the dry, narrative, unanimated Style of a Perſon relating difficulties and dangers ſurmounted, can be; the relater perfectly at eaſe; and if himſelf unmoved by his own Story, not likely greatly to affect the Heart of the Reader."</q>
            </p>
            <p>What will be found to be more particularly aimed at in the following Work, is—To warn the Inconſiderate and Thoughtleſs of the one Sex, againſt the baſe arts and deſigns of ſpecious Contrivers of the other—To caution Parents againſt the undue exerciſe of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural authority over their Children in the great article of Marriage—To warn Children againſt preferring a Man of Pleaſure to a Man of Probity, upon that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous but too commonly-received notion, <hi>That a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Rake makes the beſt Huſband.</hi>—But above all, To inveſtigate the higheſt and moſt important Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines not only of Morality, but of Chriſtianity, by ſhewing them thrown into action in the conduct of the
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0041800508:7"/>
               <hi>worthy</hi> characters; while the <hi>unworthy,</hi> who ſet thoſe Doctrines at defiance, are condignly, and, as may be ſaid, conſequentially, puniſhed.</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, conſiderate Readers will not enter upon the peruſal of the Piece before them, as if it were deſigned <hi>only</hi> to divert and amuſe. It will probably be thought tedious to all ſuch as <hi>dip</hi> into it, expecting a <hi>light Novel,</hi> or <hi>tranſitory Romance</hi>; and look upon Story in it (intereſting as that is generally allowed to be) as its <hi>ſole end,</hi> rather than as a vehicle to the Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Fault having been found, particularly by elderly Readers, and by ſome who have weak Eyes, with the Smallneſs of the Type, on which ſome Parts of the Three laſt Volumes were printed (which was done in order to bring the Work, that had extended to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſirable Length, into as ſmall a Compaſs as poſſible) the preſent Edition is uniformly printed on the larger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſized Letter of the three made uſe of before. But the doing this, together with the Additions above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, has unavoidably run the Seven Volumes into Eight.</p>
            <p>The Work having been originally publiſhed at three different times; and a greater diſtance than was intended having paſſed between the firſt publication and the ſecond; a Preface was thought proper to be affixed to the third and fourth Volumes; being the ſecond pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication. A very learned and eminent Hand was ſo kind as to favour the Editor, at his requeſt, with one. But the occaſion of inſerting it being <hi>temporary,</hi> and the Editor having been left at liberty to do with it as he pleaſed, it was omitted in the Second Edition, when the whole Work came to be printed together; as was, for the ſame reaſon, the Preface to the firſt Volume;
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0041800508:8"/>
and a ſhort Advertiſement to the Reader inſerted inſtead of both. That Advertiſement being alſo temporary, the preſent Addreſs to the Reader is ſubſtituted in its place.</p>
            <p>In the Second Edition an ample <hi>Table of Contents</hi> to the <hi>whole</hi> Work was prefixed to the firſt Volume: But that having in ſome meaſure anticipated the Cataſtrophe, and been thought to detain the Reader too long from entering upon the Hiſtory, it has been judged adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>add</hi> (and that rather than <hi>prefix</hi>) to <hi>each</hi> Volume its <hi>particular</hi> Contents; which will ſerve not only as an Index, but as a brief Recapitulation of the moſt material paſſages contained in it; and which will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the Reader to connect in his mind the peruſed volume with that which follows; and more clearly ſhew the characters and views of the particular cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents.</p>
            <p>An ingenious Gentleman having made a Collection of many of the Moral and Inſtructive Sentiments in this Hiſtory, and preſented it to the Editor, he thought the deſign and uſefulneſs of the Work could not be more ſtrikingly exhibited, than by inſerting it (greatly enlarged) at the end of the laſt Volume. The Reader will accordingly find it there, digeſted under proper Heads, with References to the Pages where each Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Aphoriſm, Reflection, or Obſervation, is to be found, either wrought into the <hi>practice</hi> of the reſpective correſpondents, or recommended by them as uſeful <hi>theory</hi> to the Youth of both Sexes <note n="*" place="bottom">There was a kind of Neceſſity to omit in this Volume, which contains the Reſtured Paſſages and Letters, the References to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Pages; as there were two Editions to be referred to, had they been inſerted; which would have only ſerved to puzzle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd perplex the Reader: And it is humbly preſumed, that the Sentiments or Maxims are, generally, of ſuch Importance, as to be ſound not unworthy of the Obſervation of the youthful Reader, altho' they were not to have the cloſe Relation which they <hi>have,</hi> to the Hiſtory of CLARISSA.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0041800508:9"/>Different Perſons, as might be expected, have been of different opinions, in relation to the conduct of the Heroine in particular Situations; and ſeveral worthy perſons have objected to the general Cataſtrophe, and other parts of the Hiſtory. Whatever is thought material of theſe ſhall be taken notice of by way of POSTSCRIPT, at the concluſion of the Hiſtory; for this Work being addreſſed to the Public as a Hiſtory of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> thoſe parts of it which are propoſed to carry with them the force of an Example, ought to be as unobjectible as is conſiſtent with the <hi>deſign of the whole,</hi> and with <hi>human nature.</hi>

ſtept to the door with the pen in my hand—Always writing, Miſs! ſaid the bold wench: It is admirable how you can get away what you write—But the Fairies, they ſay, are always at hand to help Lovers. —She retired in ſo much haſte, that had I been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, I could not take the notice of this inſolence which it deſerved.</p>

                           <p>WOULD you not have thought, my dear Miſs Howe, as well as I, that my propoſal muſt have been accepted? And that my Brother, by the laſt article of his unbrotherly Letter (where he threatens to go to Scotland if it ſhould be hearkened to) was of opinion that it <hi>would?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For my part, after I had read the unkind Letter
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0041800508:14"/>
over and over, I concluded, upon the whole, that a Reconciliation upon terms ſo diſadvantageous to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as hardly any other perſon in my caſe, I dare ſay, would have propoſed, muſt be the reſult of this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's conference. And in that belief I had begun to give myſelf new trouble in thinking (this difficulty over) how I ſhould be able to pacify Lovelace on that part of my engagement, by which I undertook to break off all correſpondence with him, unleſs my friends ſhould be brought by the interpoſition of his powerful friends, and any offers they might make (which it was rather <hi>his</hi> part to ſuggeſt, than <hi>mine</hi> to intimate) to change their minds.</p>
                           <p>Thus was I employed, not very agreeably, you may believe, becauſe of the vehemence of the tempers I had to conflict with; when breakfaſting-time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and my judges began to arrive.</p>
                           <p>And oh! how my heart fluttered on hearing the chariot of the one, and then of the other, rattle thro' the court-yard, and the hollow-ſounding footſtep giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice of each perſon's ſtepping out, to take his place on the awful bench which my fancy had formed for them and my other judges!</p>
                           <p>That, thought I, is my Aunt Heryey's! That my Uncle Harlowe's! Now comes my Uncle Antony! And my imagination made a fourth chariot for the odious Solmes, altho' it happened that he was not there.</p>
                           <p>And now, thought I, are they all aſſembled: And now my Brother calls upon my Siſter to make <hi>her</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port! Now the hard-hearted Bella interlards her ſpeech with invective! Now has ſhe concluded her report! Now they debate upon it!—Now does my Brother flame! Now threaten to go to Scotland! Now is he chidden, and now ſoothed!</p>
                           <p>And then I ran thro' the whole conference in my imagination, forming ſpeeches for this perſon and that, <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con.</hi> till all concluded, as I flattered myſelf, in an acceptance of my conditions, and in giving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0041800508:15"/>
to have an inſtrument drawn to tie me up to my good behaviour: While I ſuppoſed all agreed to give Solmes a Wife every way more worthy of him, and with <hi>her</hi> the promiſe of my Grandfather's Eſtate, in caſe of my forfeiture, or dying unmarried, on the righteous condition he propoſes to entitle himſelf to it with me.</p>
                           <p>And now, thought I, am I to be ordered down to recognize my own propoſals. And how ſhall I look upon my awful judges? How ſhall I ſtand the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of ſome, the ſet ſurlineſs of others, the return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love of one or two? How ſhall I be affected!</p>
                           <p>Then I wept: Then I dried my eyes: Then I practiſed at my glaſs for a look more chearful than my heart.</p>
                           <p>And now [as any-thing ſtirred] is my Siſter coming to declare the iſſue of all: Tears guſhing again, my heart fluttering as a bird againſt its wires; drying my eyes again and again to no purpoſe.</p>
                           <p>And thus, my Nancy (excuſe the fanciful prolixity) was I employed, and ſuch were my thoughts and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, when I found a very different reſult from the hopeful conference.</p>
                           <p>For about Ten o'clock up came my Siſter, with an air of cruel triumph, waving her hand with a light flouriſh—</p>
                           <p>Obedience without reſerve is required of you, Clary, My Papa is juſtly incenſed, that you ſhould <hi>preſume</hi> to diſpute his will, and to make conditions with him. He knows what is beſt for you: And as you own matters are gone a great way between this hated Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and you, they will believe nothing you ſay; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you will give the <hi>only</hi> inſtance, that will put them out of doubt of the ſincerity of your promiſes.</p>
                           <p>What, child, are you ſurpriſed?—Cannot you ſpeak?—Then, it ſeems, you had expected a different iſſue, had you?—Strange that you could! —With all your acknowlegements and confeſſions, ſo creditable to your <hi>noted prudence!</hi>—</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0041800508:16"/>I was indeed ſpeechleſs for ſome time: My eyes were even fixed, and ceaſed to flow. But, upon the hard-hearted Bella's proceeding with her airs of inſult, Indeed I <hi>was</hi> miſtaken, ſaid I; Indeed I was!—For in you, Bella, I expected, I hoped for, a Siſter—</p>
                           <p>What! interrupted ſhe, with all your mannerly flings, and your deſpiſing airs, did you expect, that I was capable of telling ſtories for you?—Did you think, that when I was aſked my own opinion of the ſincerity of your declarations, I could not tell them, <hi>how far matters had gone between you and your Fellow?</hi>— When the intention is to bend that ſtubborn will of yours to your duty, do you think I would deceive them?—Do you think I would encourage them to call you down, to contradict all that I ſhould have <hi>invented</hi> in your favour?</p>
                           <p>Well, well, Bella; I am the leſs obliged to you; that's all. I was willing to think, that I had ſtill a Brother and Siſter. But I find I am miſtaken.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Pretty Mopſa-eyed ſoul,</hi> was her expreſſion!—And was it willing to think it had ſtill a <hi>Brother</hi> and <hi>Siſter?</hi> And why don't you go on, Clary? [mocking my half-weeping accent] I thought too I had a <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother, two Uncles,</hi> and an <hi>Aunt: But I am miſ— taken, that's all</hi>—Come, Clary, ſay this, and it will in part be true, becauſe you have thrown off their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and becauſe you reſpect one vile wretch more than them all.</p>
                           <p>How have I deſerved this at your hands, Siſter?— But I will only ſay, I pity you.</p>
                           <p>And with that diſdainful air too, Clary!—None of that bridled neck! None of your ſcornful pity, Girl! I beſeech you!</p>
                           <p>This ſort of behaviour is natural to you, ſurely, Bella!—What <hi>new</hi> talents does it diſcover in you!— But proceed—If it be a pleaſure to you, proceed, Bella. And ſince I muſt not pity <hi>you,</hi> I will pity <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</hi> For nobody elſe will.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0041800508:17"/>Becauſe you don't, ſaid ſhe—</p>
                           <p>Huſh, Bella, interrupting her, <hi>Becauſe I don't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it</hi>—I know you were going to ſay ſo. I will ſay as you ſay in every-thing; and that's the way to pleaſe you.</p>
                           <p>Then ſay, Lovelace is a villain.</p>
                           <p>So I will, when I think him ſo.</p>
                           <p>Then you don't think him ſo?</p>
                           <p>Indeed I don't. <hi>You</hi> did not always, Bella.</p>
                           <p>And what, Clary, mean you by that? [briſtling up to me]—Tell me what you mean by that reflection?</p>
                           <p>Tell me why you call it a reflection?—What did I ſay?</p>
                           <p>Thou art a provoking creature—But what ſay you to two or three duels of that wretch's?</p>
                           <p>I can't tell what to ſay, unleſs I knew the occaſions.</p>
                           <p>Do you juſtify duelling at all?</p>
                           <p>I do not: Neither can I help his duelling.</p>
                           <p>Will you go down, and humble that ſtubborn ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of yours to your Mamma?</p>
                           <p>I ſaid nothing.</p>
                           <p>Shall I conduct your Ladyſhip down? [offering to take my declined hand].</p>
                           <p>What! not vouchſafe to anſwer me?</p>
                           <p>I turned from her in ſilence.</p>
                           <p>What! turn your back upon me too!—Shall I bring up your Mamma to you, Love? [following me, and taking my ſtruggling hand]. What! not ſpeak yet! Come, my ſullen, ſilent dear, ſpeak one word to me—You muſt ſay <hi>two</hi> very ſoon to Mr. Solmes, I can tell you that.</p>
                           <p>Then [guſhing out into tears, which I could not hold in longer] they ſhall be the laſt words I will ever ſpeak.</p>
                           <p>Well, well [inſultingly wiping my averted face with her handkerchief, while her other hand held mine, in a ridiculing tone] I am glad any-thing will make thee ſpeak: Then you think you may be

brought to ſpeak the <hi>two</hi> words—Only they are to be the laſt!—How like a gentle <hi>Lovyer</hi> from its ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bleeding heart was that!</p>
                           <p>Ridiculous Bella!</p>
                           <p>Saucy Clary! [changing her ſneering tone to an imperious one]. But do you think you can humble yourſelf to go down to your Mamma?</p>
                           <p>I am tired with ſuch ſtuff as this. Tell me, Bella, if my Mamma will condeſcend to ſee me?</p>
                           <p>Yes, if you can be dutiful at laſt.</p>
                           <p>I can. I will.</p>
                           <p>But what call you dutiful?</p>
                           <p>To give up my own <hi>inclinations</hi>—That's ſomething more for you to tell of—in obedience to my Parents commands; and to beg I may not be made miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with a man that is fitter for <hi>any-body</hi> than for me.</p>
                           <p>For <hi>me,</hi> do you mean, Clary?</p>
                           <p>Why not? ſince you have put the queſtion. You have a better opinion of him than I have. My friends, I hope, would not think him too good for <hi>me,</hi> and not good <hi>enough</hi> for <hi>you</hi>—But cannot you tell me, Bella, what is to become of me, without inſulting over me thus?—If I muſt be thus treated, remember, that if I am guilty of any raſhneſs, the uſage I meet with will juſtify it.</p>
                           <p>So, Clary, you are contriving an <hi>excuſe,</hi> I find, for ſomewhat that we have not doubted has been in your head a great while.</p>
                           <p>If it were ſo, you ſeem reſolved, for <hi>your</hi> part, and ſo does my Brother for <hi>his,</hi> that I ſhall not want one. —But indeed, Bella, I can bear no longer this repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the worſt part of yeſterday's converſation.

                              <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0041800508:19"/>Yes, it is I, Bella; and I will claim the protection due to a child of the family, or to know why I am to be thus treated, when I offer only to preſerve to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Liberty of <hi>refuſal,</hi> which belongs to my Sex; and, to pleaſe my Parents, would give up my <hi>choice.</hi> I have contented myſelf till now to take <hi>ſecond-hand</hi> meſſengers, and <hi>firſt-hand</hi> inſults: You are but my Siſter: My Brother is not my Sovereign. And while I have a Father and Mother living, I will not be thus treated by a Brother and Siſter, and their ſervants, all ſetting upon me, as it ſhould ſeem, to make me deſperate, and to do a raſh thing.—I will know, in ſhort, Siſter Bella, <hi>why</hi> I am to be conſtrained thus? —What is intended by it?—And whether I am to be conſidered as a <hi>child</hi> or a <hi>ſlave?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>She ſtood aghaſt all this time, partly with real, partly with affected ſurprize.</p>
                           <p>And is it <hi>you?</hi> Is it <hi>indeed</hi> you?—Well, Clary, you amaze me! But ſince you are ſo deſirous to refer yourſelf to your Father and Mother, I will go down, and tell them what you ſay. Your friends are not yet gone, I believe: They ſhall aſſemble again; and then you may come down, and plead your own cauſe in perſon.</p>
                           <p>Let me then. But let my <hi>Brother</hi> and <hi>you</hi> be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. You have made yourſelves too much <hi>parties</hi> againſt me, to ſit as my judges. And I deſire to have none of yours or his interpoſitions. I am ſure you could not have repreſented what I propoſed fairly: I am <hi>ſure</hi> you could not. Nor is it poſſible you ſhould be <hi>commiſſioned</hi> to treat me thus.</p>
                           <p>Well, well, I'll call up my Brother to you.—I will indeed.—He ſhall juſtify himſelf, as well as me.</p>
                           <p>I deſire not to ſee my Brother, except he will come <hi>as</hi> a Brother, laying aſide the authority he has unjuſtly aſſumed over me.</p>
                           <p>And ſo, Clary, it is nothing to him, or to me, is it? that our Siſter ſhall diſgrace her whole family?</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0041800508:20"/>As how, Bella, diſgrace it?—The man whom you thus freely treat, is a man of birth and fortune: He is a man of parts, and nobly allied.—He was once thought worthy of you; and I wiſh to Heaven you had had him. I am ſure it was not my fault you had not, altho' you treat me thus!</p>
                           <p>This ſet her into a flame: I wiſh I had forborn it. O how the poor Bella raved! I thought ſhe would have beat me once or twice: And ſhe vowed, her fingers itched to do ſo—But I was not worth her <hi>anger:</hi> Yet ſhe flamed on.</p>
                           <p>We were heard to be high.—And Betty came up from my Mother to command my Siſter to attend her.—She went down accordingly, threatening me with letting every one know what a violent creature I had ſhewn myſelf to be.</p>

                           <p>IT is with infinite regret that I think myſelf obliged, by pen and ink, to repeat my apprehenſions, that it is impoſſible for me ever to obtain a ſhare in the Affections of your beloved Daughter. O that it were not too evident to every one, as well as to myſelf, even to our very ſervants, that my Love for her, and my Aſſiduities, expoſe me rather to her Scorn [For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, Madam, the hard word!] than to the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to a man whoſe propoſals have met with your approbation, and who loves her above all the women in the world!</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0041800508:23"/>Well might the merit of my paſſion be doubted, if, like Mr. Solmes to the truly admirable Miſs Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa Harlowe, I could continue my addreſſes to Miſs Howe's diſtaſte. Yet what will not the diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance coſt me!</p>
                           <p>Give me leave, nevertheleſs, deareſt, worthieſt Lady, to repeat, what I told you, on Monday night, at Mrs. Larkins's, with a heart even burſting with grief, That I wanted not the treatment of that day to convince me, that I am not, nor ever can be, the object of Miſs Howe's voluntary favour. What hopes can there be, that a Lady will ever eſteem, as a Huſband, the man, whom, as a Lover, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſes? Will not every act of obligingneſs from ſuch a one, be conſtrued an unmanly tameneſs of ſpirit, and entitle him the more to her diſdain?—My heart is full: Forgive me if I ſay, that Miſs Howe's treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of me does no credit either to her education, or fine ſenſe.</p>
                           <p>Since then it is too evident, that ſhe cannot eſteem me; and ſince, as I have heard it juſtly obſerved by the excellent Miſs Clariſſa Harlowe, that Love is not a voluntary paſſion, would it not be ungenerous to ſubject the dear Daughter to the diſpleaſure of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo juſtly fond of her; and you, Madam, while you are ſo good as to intereſt yourſelf in my favour, to uneaſineſs? And why, were I to be even ſure, at laſt, of ſucceeding by means of your kind partiality to me, ſhould I wiſh to make the Beſt-beloved of my ſoul unhappy; ſince mutual muſt be our happineſs, or miſery for life the conſequence to both?</p>
                           <p>My beſt wiſhes will for ever attend the dear, the ever-dear Lady! May her Nuptials be happy! They muſt be ſo, if ſhe marry the man ſhe can honour with her Love. Yet I will ſay, that whoever be the happy, the thrice happy man, he never can love her with a paſſion more ardent and more ſincere than mine.</p>

A diſtinction, on which (and not on my own merits) I had entirely relied; but which, I find, can avail me nothing.

                           <p>I Cannot but ſay, Mr. Hickman, but you have cauſe to be diſſatisfied—to be out of humour—to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed—with Nancy—But, upon my word; But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed—What ſhall I ſay?—Yet this I will ſay, that you <hi>good</hi> young gentlemen know nothing at all of our Sex. Shall I tell you—But why ſhould I? And yet I will ſay, That if Nancy did not think well of you in the main, ſhe is too generous to treat you ſo freely as ſhe does.—Don't you think ſhe has courage enough to tell me, She would not ſee you, and to refuſe at any time ſeeing you, as ſhe knows on what account you come, if ſhe had not ſomething in her head favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to you?—Fie! that I am forced to ſay thus much in writing, when I have hinted it to you twenty and twenty times by word of mouth!</p>
                           <p>But if you are ſo indifferent, Mr. Hickman—If you think you can part with her for her ſkittiſh tricks —If <hi>my</hi> intereſt in your favour—Why, Mr. Hick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I muſt tell you, that my Nancy is worth bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with, If ſhe be <hi>fooliſh</hi>—what is that owing to?
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0041800508:25"/>
Is it not to her <hi>Wit?</hi> Let me tell you, Sir, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the convenience without the inconvenience. What workman loves not a ſharp tool to work with? But is there not more danger from a ſharp tool, than from a blunt one? And what workman will throw away a ſharp tool, becauſe it may cut his fingers? Wit may be likened to a ſharp tool. And there is ſomething very pretty in Wit, let me tell you. Often and often have I been forced to ſmile at her arch turns upon me, when I could have beat her for them. And, pray, don't I bear a great deal from her?—And why? Becauſe I love her. And would you not wiſh me to judge of your Love for her by my own? And would not you bear with her?—Don't you love her (what tho' with another ſort of Love?) as well as I do? I do aſſure you, Sir, that if I thought you did not—Well, but it is plain that you don't!—And is it plain that you don't?—Well, then, you muſt do as you think beſt.</p>
                           <p>Well might the merit of your paſſion be doubted, you ſay, if like Mr. Solmes—Fiddle-ſaddle!—Why, you are a captious man, I think!—Has Nancy been ſo plain in her repulſes of you as Miſs Clary Harlowe has been to Mr. Solmes?—Does Nancy love any man better than you, altho' ſhe may not ſhew ſo much Love to you as you wiſh for!—If ſhe did, let me tell you, ſhe would have let us all hear of it.—What idle compariſons then!</p>
                           <p>But it may be you are tired out. It may be you have ſeen ſomebody elſe—It may be you would wiſh to change Miſtreſſes with that gay wretch Mr. Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. It may be too, that, in that caſe, Nancy would not be ſorry to change Lovers—The <hi>truly admirable</hi> Miſs Clariſſa Harlowe! And the <hi>excellent</hi> Miſs Clariſſa Harlowe!—Good-lack!—But take care, Mr. Hick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that you do not praiſe any woman living, let her be as admirable and as excellent as ſhe will, above your own Miſtreſs. No polite man will do that, ſurely.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0041800508:26"/>
And take care too, that you do not make her or me think you are in earneſt in your anger—Juſt tho' it may be, as anger only—I would not for a thouſand pounds, that Nancy ſhould know that you can ſo eaſily part with her, if you have the Love for her which you declare you have. Be ſure, if you are not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely determined, that you do not ſo much as whiſper the contents of this your Letter to your own heart, as I may ſay.</p>
                           <p>Her treatment of you, you ſay, does no credit either to her education, or fine ſenſe. Very home put, truly! Nevertheleſs, ſo ſay I. But is not hers the diſgrace, more than yours? I can aſſure you, that every-body blames her for it. And <hi>why</hi> do they blame her?—Why? Becauſe they think you merit better treatment at her hands: And is not this to your cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit? Who but pities <hi>you,</hi> and blames <hi>her?</hi> Do the ſervants, who, as you obſerve, ſee her ſkittiſh airs, diſreſpect you for them? Do they not, at ſuch times, look concerned for you? Are they not then doubly officious in their reſpects and ſervices to you?—I have obſerved with pleaſure, that they are.</p>
                           <p>But you are afraid you ſhall be thought tame, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, when married. That you ſhall not be thought <hi>manly</hi> enough, I warrant!—And this was poor Mr. Howe's fear. And many a tug did this lordly fear coſt us both, God knows!—Many more than needed, I am ſure!—And more than ought to have been, had he known how to <hi>bear and forbear</hi>; as is the duty of thoſe who pretend to have moſt ſenſe—And, pray, which would you have to have moſt ſenſe, the woman or the man?</p>
                           <p>Well, Sir, and now what remains, if you really love Nancy ſo well as you ſay you do?—Why, I leave that to you. You may, if you pleaſe, come to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt with me in the morning. But with no <hi>full heart,</hi> nor reſenting looks, I adviſe you; except you can brave it out.

Firſt, Becauſe his Pride was gratified by the Grand-mother's deſiring him to ſpare her Grand-daughter. <hi>Many a pretty Rogue,</hi> ſays he, <hi>had I ſpared, whom I did not ſpare, had my Power been acknowleged, and my Mercy in time implored. But the</hi> Debellare Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbos <hi>ſhould be my motto, were I to have a new one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His other motive will be explained in the following paſſage, in the ſame Letter. <hi>I never was ſo honeſt, for ſo long together,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſince my matriculation. It</hi> behoves me <hi>ſo to be.</hi> Some way or other <hi>my receſs</hi> [at this little Inn] <hi>may be found out; and it will then be thought that my Roſebud has attracted me. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in my favour from ſimplicities ſo amiable, may eſtabliſh me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly, as the Reader will hereafter ſee, Mr. Lovelace finds by the <hi>Effects,</hi> his expectations from the contrivance he ſet on foot by means of his agent Joſeph Leman (who plays, as above, upon Betty Barnes) fully anſwered, tho' he could not know what paſſed on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion between the two Ladies.</p>
                     <p>This explanation is the more neceſſary to be given, as ſeveral of our Readers (thro' want of due attention) have attributed to Mr. Lovelace, on his behaviour to his Roſebud, a greater merit than was due to him; and moreover imagined, that it was improbable, that a man,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0041800508:28"/>
who was capable of acting ſo generouſly (as they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) in <hi>this</hi> inſtance, ſhould be guilty of any <hi>atrocious</hi> vileneſs. Not conſidering, that Love, Pride, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, as he owns in Vol. <hi>i.</hi> Letter <hi>xxxi.</hi> were ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of equal force in his compoſition; and that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance was a <hi>ſtimulus</hi> to him.</p>

                     <p>WHY, Jack, thou needſt not make ſuch a <hi>wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as the girls ſay, if I ſhould have taken large ſtrides already towards reformation; For doſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0041800508:30"/>
thou not ſee, that while I have been ſo aſſiduouſly, night and day, purſuing this ſingle charmer, I have infinitely leſs to anſwer for, than otherwiſe I ſhould have had? Let me ſee, how many days and nights?— Forty, I believe, after open trenches, ſpent in the ſap only, and never a mine ſprung yet!</p>
                     <p>By a moderate computation, a dozen kites might have fallen, while I have been only trying to enſnare this ſingle lark: Nor yet do I ſee when I ſhall be able to bring her to my lure: More innocent days yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore!—But reformation for my ſtalking-horſe, I hope, will be a ſure, tho' a ſlow method to effect all my purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>Then, Jack, <hi>thou</hi> wilt have a merit too in engaging my pen, ſince thy time would be otherwiſe worſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed: And, after all, who knows but by creating new habits, at the expence of the old, a real reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation may be brought about? I have promiſed it; and I believe there is a pleaſure to be found in being good, reverſing that of Nat, Lee's madmen,
<q>— Which none but <hi>good</hi> men know.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>By all this, ſeeſt thou-not, how greatly preferable it is, on twenty accounts, to purſue a difficult, rather than an eaſy chace? I have a deſire to inculcate this pleaſure upon thee, and to teach thee to fly at nobler game than daws, crows, and wigeons: I have a mind to ſhew thee from time to time, in the courſe of the correſpondence thou haſt ſo earneſtly wiſhed me to begin on this illuſtrious occaſion, that theſe exalted Ladies may be abaſed, and to obviate one of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that thou madeſt to me, when we were laſt together, that the pleaſure which attends theſe nobler aims, remunerates not the pains they bring with them; ſince, like a paltry fellow as thou wert, thou aſſertedſt, that all women are alike.</p>
                     <p>Thou knoweſt nothing, Jack, of the delicacies of intrigue: Nothing of the glory of outwitting the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0041800508:31"/>
Witty and the Watchful: Of the joys that fill the mind of the inventive or contriving genius, rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating which to uſe of the different webs that offer to him for the entanglement of a haughty charmer, who in her day has given him unnumbered torments.— Thou, Jack, who, like a dog at his eaſe, contenteſt thyſelf to growl over a bone thrown out to thee, doſt not know the joys of the chace, and in purſuing a winding game: Theſe I will endeavour to rouſe thee to, and thou wilt have reaſon doubly and trebly to thank me, as well becauſe of thy preſent delight, as with regard to thy proſpects beyond the moon.</p>
                     <p>To this place I had written, purely to amuſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, before I was admitted to my charmer. But now I have to tell thee, that I was quite right in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that ſhe would ſet up for herſelf, and diſmiſs me: For ſhe has declared in ſo many words, that ſuch was her reſolution: And why? Becauſe, to be plain with me, the more ſhe ſaw of <hi>me,</hi> and of <hi>my ways,</hi> the leſs ſhe liked of either.</p>
                     <p>This cut me to the heart!—I did not cry indeed!— Had I been a <hi>woman,</hi> I ſhould tho'; and that moſt plentifully: But I pulled out a white cambrick hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief: <hi>That</hi> I could command, but not my <hi>tears.</hi>

                           <p>He was ſtruck all of a heap.</p>
                           <p>What ſay you, Mr. Lovelace? You know, all you mean is for my good. Surely I am my own miſtreſs: Surely I need not aſk your leave to make what terms I pleaſe for myſelf, <hi>ſo long as I break none with you?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>He hemm'd twice or thrice.—Why, Madam, Why, Madam, I cannot ſay—Then pauſing—and riſing from his ſeat, with petulance: I ſee plainly enough, ſaid he, the reaſon why none of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals can be accepted: At <hi>laſt</hi> I am to be a ſacrifice to your Reconciliation with your implacable family.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0041800508:36"/>It has always been your reſpectful way, Mr. Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, to treat my family in this free manner. But pray. Sir, when you call <hi>others</hi> implacable, ſee that you deſerve not the ſame cenſure <hi>yourſelf.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>He muſt needs ſay; there was no love loſt between ſome of my family and him; but he had not deſerved of <hi>them</hi> what they had of <hi>him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Yourſelf being judge, I ſuppoſe, Sir?</p>
                           <p>All the world, you yourſelf. Madam, being judge.</p>
                           <p>Then, Sir, let me tell you, had you been leſs upon your defiances, they would not have been irritated ſo much againſt you. But nobody ever heard, that avowed deſpite to the Relations of a perſon was a proper courtſhip either to that perſon, or to her friends.</p>
                           <p>Well, Madam, all that I know, is, that their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt me is ſuch, that, if you determine to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice <hi>me,</hi> you may be reconciled when you pleaſe.</p>
                           <p>And all that I know, Sir, is, that if I do give my Father the power of a negative, and he will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with <hi>that,</hi> it will be but my <hi>duty</hi> to give it him; and if I preſerve one to myſelf, I ſhall break thro' no obligation to <hi>you.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Your duty to your capricious <hi>Brother,</hi> not to your <hi>Father,</hi> you mean, Madam.</p>
                           <p>If the diſpute lay between my Brother and me at <hi>firſt,</hi> ſurely, Sir, a Father may chuſe which party he will take.</p>
                           <p>He <hi>may,</hi> Madam—But that exempts him not from blame for all that, if he take the wrong—</p>
                           <p>Different people will judge differently, Mr. Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, of the right and the wrong. <hi>You</hi> judge as you pleaſe. Shall not others as <hi>they</hi> pleaſe! And who has a right to controul a Father's judgment in his own family, and in relation to his own child?</p>
                           <p>I know, Madam, there is no arguing with you. But nevertheleſs I had hoped to have made myſelf ſome little merit with you, ſo as that I might not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0041800508:37"/>
have been the <hi>preliminary ſacrifice</hi> to a Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</p>
                           <p>Your hopes, Sir, had been better grounded, if you had had my conſent to my abandoning of my Father's houſe—</p>
                           <p>Always, Madam, and for ever, to be reminded of the choice you would have made of that damn'd Solmes—rather than—</p>
                           <p>Not ſo haſty! Not ſo raſh, Mr. Lovelace! I am convinced, that there was no intention to marry me to that Solmes on Wedneſday.</p>
                           <p>So I am told they now give out, in order to juſtify themſelves at your expence. Every-body living, Madam, is obliged to you for your kind thoughts, but I.</p>
                           <p>Excuſe me, <hi>good</hi> Mr. Lovelace [waving my hand, and bowing] that I am willing to think the beſt of my Father.</p>
                           <p>Charming Creature! ſaid he, with what a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching air is that ſaid!—And with a vehemence in his manner, would have ſnatched my hand. But I withdrew it, being much offended with him.</p>
                           <p>I think, Madam, my ſufferings for your ſake might have entitled me to ſome favour.</p>
                           <p>

                           <p>Lord! Madam, [aſſuming a drolling air] What have <hi>you</hi> ſuffered!—Nothing but what you can eaſily forgive. You have been <hi>only</hi> made a priſoner in your Father's houſe, by the way of doing credit to your judgment!—You have <hi>only</hi> had an innocent and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant turned out of your ſervice, becauſe you loved her—You have <hi>only</hi> had your Siſter's confident ſervant ſet over you, with leave to teaze and affront you!—</p>
                           <p>Very well. Sir!</p>
                           <p>You have <hi>only</hi> had an inſolent Brother take upon

him to treat you like a ſlave, and as inſolent a Siſter to undermine you in every-body's favour, on pretence to keep you out of hands, which, if as vile as they vilely report, are not, however, half ſo vile and cruel as their own!</p>
                           <p>Go on, Sir, if you pleaſe!</p>
                           <p>You have <hi>only</hi> been perſecuted, in order to oblige you to have a ſordid fellow, whom you have profeſſed to hate, and whom every-body deſpiſes! The Licence has been <hi>only</hi> got! The Parſon has <hi>only</hi> been held in readineſs! The day, a near, a <hi>very</hi> near day, has been <hi>only</hi> fixed! And you were <hi>only</hi> to be ſearched for your correſpondencies, and ſtill cloſer confined, till the day came, in order to deprive you of all means of eſcaping the ſnare laid for you!—But all This you can forgive! You can wiſh you had ſtood all This; inevitable as the compulſion muſt have been!—And the man who at the hazard of his life, has delivered you from all theſe mortifications, is the only perſon you <hi>cannot</hi> forgive!</p>
                           <p>Can't you go on, Sir? You ſee I have patience to hear you. Can't you go on. Sir?</p>
                           <p>I can, Madam, with <hi>my</hi> ſufferings: Which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs ought not to be mentioned, were I at laſt to be rewarded in the manner I hoped.</p>

                           <p>Wretch, Sir!—And my Brother!—This could be from no man breathing, but from him before me!</p>
                           <p>Pardon me, Madam!—But oh! how unworthy to be your Brother!—The quarrel grafted upon an old one, when at College; he univerſally known to be the aggreſſor; and revived for views equally ſordid,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0041800508:39"/>
and injurious both to yourſelf and me—Giving life to him, who would have taken away mine!</p>
                           <p>Your <hi>generoſity</hi> THIS, Sir; not your ſufferings: A little more of your <hi>ſufferings,</hi> if you pleaſe!—I hope you do not repent, that you did not murder my Brother!</p>
                           <p>My private life hunted into! My morals decried! Some of the accuſers not unfaulty!</p>
                           <p>That's an aſperſion, Sir!</p>
                           <p>Spies ſet upon my conduct! One hired to bribe my own ſervant's fidelity; perhaps to have poiſoned me at laſt, if the honeſt fellow had not—</p>

                              <hi>Facts,</hi> Mr. Lovelace!—Do you want facts in the diſplay of your ſufferings?—None of your <hi>Perhaps's,</hi> I beſeech you!</p>
                           <p>Menaces every day, and defiances, put into every one's mouth againſt me! Forced to creep about in diſguiſes—and to watch <hi>all hours</hi>—</p>
                           <p>And in <hi>all weathers,</hi> I ſuppoſe, Sir—That I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was once your grievance!—<hi>In all weathers,</hi> Sir <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. iii.

                           <p>—Like a thief, or an eves-dropper, proceeded he: And yet neither by birth nor alliances unworthy of <hi>their</hi> relation, whatever I may be and am of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Daughter; Of whom they, every one of them, are at leaſt as unworthy!—Theſe, Madam, I call ſufferings: <hi>Juſtly</hi> call ſo; if at laſt I am to be ſacrificed to an imperfect Reconciliation—<hi>Imperfect,</hi> I ſay: For can you expect to live ſo much as <hi>tolerably,</hi> under the ſame roof, after all that is paſſed, with that Brother and Siſter?</p>
                           <p>O Sir, Sir! What ſufferings have yours been! And all for my ſake, I warrant!—I can never reward you for them!—Never think of me more, I beſeech you—How can you have patience with me?—Nothing has been owing to your own behaviour, I preſume.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0041800508:40"/>
Nothing to your defiances for defiances: Nothing to your reſolution declared more than once, that you <hi>would</hi> be related to a family, which, nevertheleſs, you would not ſtoop to aſk a Relation of: Nothing, in ſhort, to courſes which every-body blamed you for, you not thinking it worth your while to juſtify your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Had I not thought you uſed in an ungentlemanly manner, as I have heretofore told you, you had not had my notice by pen and ink <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. iii. Edit. i. and ii. p. 40.</note>. That notice gave you a ſuppoſed ſecurity, and you generouſly defied my friends the more for it: And this brought upon me (perhaps not undeſervedly) my Father's diſpleaſure; without which my Brother's private pique, and ſelfiſh views, would have wanted a foundation to build upon: So that all that followed of my treatment, and your redundant <hi>Only's,</hi> I might thank you for principally, as you may yourſelf for all your <hi>ſufferings,</hi> your <hi>mighty</hi> ſufferings! — And if, voluble Sir, you have founded any merit upon them, be ſo good as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke it: And look upon <hi>me,</hi> with my forfeited repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as the only ſufferer—For what—Pray hear me out, Sir, [for he was going to ſpeak] have you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in, but your pride? Your reputation <hi>could not</hi> ſuffer: <hi>That</hi> it was beneath you to be ſolicitous about. And had you not been an unmanageable man, I ſhould not have been driven to the extremity I now every hour, as the hour paſſes, deplore—With this additional reflection upon myſelf, that I ought not to have <hi>begun,</hi> or, having begun, not <hi>continued</hi> a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with one, who thought it not worth his while to clear his own character for <hi>my ſake,</hi> or to ſubmit to my Father for <hi>his own,</hi> in a point wherein every Father ought to have an option.—</p>
                           <p>Darkneſs, light; Light, darkneſs; by my Soul! — Juſt as you pleaſe to have it. O Charmer of my heart! ſnatching my hand, and preſſing it between both his, to his lips, in a ſtrange wild way, Take me,

take me to yourſelf: Mould me as you pleaſe: I am wax in your hands: Give me your own impreſſion; and ſeal me for ever yours—We were born for each other!—You to make me happy, and ſave a ſoul—I am all error, all crime. I ſee what I ought to have done. But do you think, Madam, I can willingly conſent to be ſacrificed to a partial Reconciliation, in which I ſhall be ſo great, ſo irreparable a ſufferer?— Any-thing but <hi>that</hi>—Include me in your terms: Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to me: Promiſe for me as you pleaſe—Put a halter about my neck, and lead me by it, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of forgiveneſs on that diſgraceful penance, and of a proſtration as ſervile, to your Father's preſence (your Brother abſent); and I will beg his conſent at his feet, and bear any-thing but ſpurning from him, becauſe he is your Father. But to give you up upon <hi>cold</hi> conditions, D—n me (ſaid the ſhocking wretch) if I either will, or can!</p>
                           <p>Theſe were his words, as near as I can remember them; for his behaviour was ſo ſtrangely wild and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, that I was perfectly frighted. I thought he would have devoured my hand. I wiſhed myſelf a thouſand miles diſtant from him.</p>
                           <p>I told him, I by no means approved of his violent temper: He was too boiſterous a man for my liking. I ſaw <hi>now,</hi> by the converſation that had paſſed, what was his boaſted regard to my <hi>Injunctions</hi>; and ſhould take my meaſures accordingly, as he ſhould <hi>ſoon</hi> find. And with a half-frighted earneſtneſs I deſired him to withdraw, and leave me to myſelf.</p>
                           <p>He obeyed; and that with extreme complaiſance in his manner, but with his complexion greatly height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and a countenance as greatly diſſatisfied.</p>
                           <p>But, on recollecting all that paſſed, I plainly ſee, that he means not, if he can help it, to leave me to the liberty of refuſing him; which I had nevertheleſs preſerved a <hi>right</hi> to do; but looks upon me as <hi>his,</hi> by a ſtrange ſort of obligation, for having run away with me <hi>againſt my will.</hi>
                           </p>

                              <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0041800508:42"/>Yet you ſee he but touches upon the edges of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony neither. And that at a time generally, when he has either excited one's paſſions or apprehenſions; ſo that one cannot at once deſcend. But ſurely this cannot be his deſign.—And yet ſuch ſeemed to be his behaviour to my Siſter <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. i. Edit. i. and ii. p. 11, 12.</note>, when he provoked her to refuſe him, and ſo tamely ſubmitted, as he did, to her refuſal.—But he dare not—What can one ſay of ſo various a man? —I am now again out of conceit with him. I wiſh I were fairly out of his power.</p>
                           <p>He has ſent up three times to beg admittance; in the two laſt, with unuſual earneſtneſs. But I have ſent him word I will firſt finiſh what I am about.</p>
                           <p>What to do about going from this place, I cannot tell.

                           <p>I have a Letter, Madam, ſaid he, from Lady Betty Lawrance, and another from my Couſin Charlotte, But of theſe more by-and-by. I came now to make my humble acknowlegements to you, upon the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that paſſed between us ſo lately.</p>

                           <p>All this is mighty good, Sir: But to what does it tend?</p>
                           <p>Why, Madam, when I came to conſider what you had propoſed, as to the terms of Reconciliation with your friends; and when I recollected, that you had always <hi>referred to yourſelf</hi> to <hi>approve</hi> or <hi>reject</hi> me, according to my <hi>merits</hi> or <hi>demerits</hi>; I plainly ſaw, that it was rather a <hi>condeſcenſion</hi> in you, that you were pleaſed to aſk my conſent to thoſe terms, than that you were impoſing a <hi>new Law:</hi> And I now, Madam, beg your pardon for my impatience: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever terms you think proper to come into with your Relations, which will enable you to honour me with the <hi>conditional</hi> effect of your promiſe to me, theſe be pleaſed to conſent to: And if I loſe you, inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as that thought is to me; yet, as it muſt be by my own fault, I ought to thank myſelf for it.</p>
                           <p>What think you, Miſs Howe?—Do you believe he can have any view in this?—I cannot ſee any he could have; and I thought it beſt, as he put it in ſo right a manner, to appear not to doubt the ſincerity of his confeſſion, and to accept of it, as ſincere.</p>
                           <p>He then read to me part of Lady Betty's Letter; turning down the beginning, which was a little too ſevere upon him, he ſaid, for my eye: And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, by the ſtyle, the remainder of it was in a <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective</hi> ſtrain.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0041800508:45"/>It was too plain, I told him, that he muſt have great faults, that none of his Relations could write to him, but with mingled cenſure for ſome bad action.</p>
                           <p>And it is as plain, my deareſt creature, ſaid he, that you, who know not of any ſuch faults, but by ſurmiſe, are equally ready to condemn me.—Will not charity allow you to infer, that <hi>their</hi> charges are no better grounded?—And that my principal fault has been careleſneſs of my character, and too little ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude to clear myſelf, when aſperſed? Which I do aſſure you, is the caſe.</p>

                     <p>Yes, Madam, I thought of it as ſoon as I ſaid it, but not before.

                     <p>O Madam, I have read the Bible, as a fine piece of antient hiſtory—But as I hope to be ſaved, it has for ſome few years paſt made me ſo uneaſy, when I have popped upon ſome paſſages in it, that I have been forced to run to muſic or company to divert my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>O Sir, do you want to be complimented into Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Salvation?</hi> But pray, Mr. Lovelace, do you mean any-thing at all, when you ſwear ſo often as you do, <hi>By your Soul,</hi> or bind an aſſeveration with the words, <hi>As you hope to be ſaved?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O my beloved creature, ſhifting his ſeat; let us call another cauſe.</p>

                     <p>Deareſt Madam, forbear for the preſent: I am but in my Noviciate. Your foundation muſt be laid brick by brick: You'll hinder the progreſs of the good work you would promote, if you tumble in a whole waggon-load at once upon me.</p>
                     <p>Lord bleſs me, thought I, what a character is that of a Libertine!—What a creature am I, who have riſqued what I have riſqued with ſuch a one!—What a taſk before me, if my hopes continue of reforming

ſuch a wild Indian as this!—Nay, worſe than a wild Indian; for a man who errs with his eyes open, and againſt conviction, is a thouſand times worſe for what he knows, and much harder to be reclaimed, than if he had never known any-thing at all.</p>
                     <p>I was equally ſhocked <hi>at</hi> him, and concerned <hi>for</hi> him; and, having laid ſo few bricks (to ſpeak to his alluſion) and thoſe ſo ill-cemented, I was as willing as the gay Inconſiderate, to call another cauſe, as he termed it—Another cauſe, too, more immediately preſſing upon me, from my uncertain ſituation.</p>

                     <p>I could hardly forbear taking her into my arms upon it, in ſpite of an expected <hi>tempeſt.</hi> So much wit, ſo much beauty, ſuch a lively manner, and ſuch exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quickneſs and penetration! O Belford! ſhe muſt be nobody's but mine. I can now account for, and juſtify, Herod's command to deſtroy his Mariamne, if he returned not alive from his Interview with Caeſar: For were I to know, that it were but probable, that any other man were to have this charming creature, even after my death, the very thought would be enough to provoke me to cut that man's throat, were he a Prince.</p>
                     <p>I may be deemed by this Lady a rapid, a boiſterous Lover—and <hi>ſhe</hi> may like me the leſs for it: But all the Ladies I have met with till now, loved to raiſe a tempeſt, and to enjoy it: Nor did they ever raiſe it, but I enjoyed it too!—Lord ſend as once happily to London!</p>

                        <hi>Mr. Lovelace gives the following account of his rude rapture., when he ſeized her hand, and put her, by his <hi>WILD</hi> manner, as ſhe expreſſes it</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Darkneſs and light, I ſwore, were convertible at her pleaſure: She could make any ſubject plauſible.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0041800508:49"/>
I was all error; ſhe all perfection. And I ſnatched her hand; and, more than kiſſed it, I was ready to devour it. There was, I believe, a kind of phrenſy in my manner, which threw her into a panic, like that of Semele perhaps, when the Thunderer, in all his majeſty, ſurrounded with ten thouſand celeſtial burning-glaſſes, was about to ſcorch her into a cinder.</p>
                     <p>HAD not my heart miſgiven me, and had I not, juſt in time, recollected that ſhe was not ſo much in my power, but that ſhe might abandon me at her pleaſure, having more friends in that houſe than I had, I ſhould at that moment have made offers, that would have decided all, one way or other.—But, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I had ſhewed too much meaning in my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I gave it another turn.—But little did the Charmer think what an eſcape either ſhe or I had (as the event might have proved) from the ſudden guſt of paſſion, which had like to have blown me into her arms. She was born, I told her, to make me happy, and to ſave a ſoul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He gives the reſt of his vehement ſpeech pretty nearly in the ſame words as the Lady gives them. And then proceeds:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I SAW ſhe was frighted: And ſhe would have had Reaſon, had the ſcene been London; and that place in London, which I have in view to carry her to. She confirmed me in my apprehenſion, that I had alarmed her too much: She told me, that ſhe ſaw what my boaſted regard to her Injunctions was; and ſhe would take proper meaſures upon it, as I ſhould ſoon find: That ſhe was ſhocked at my violent airs; and if I hoped any favour from her, I muſt that inſtant withdraw, and leave her to her recollection.</p>
                     <p>She pronounced this in ſuch a manner, as ſhewed ſhe was ſet upon it; and, having ſtept out of the <hi>gentle,</hi> the <hi>polite</hi> part I had ſo newly engaged to act,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0041800508:50"/>
I thought a ready obedience was the beſt atonement. And indeed I was ſenſible, from her anger and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes, that I wanted time myſelf for recollection. And ſo I withdrew, with the ſame veneration as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning ſubject would withdraw from the preſence of his Sovereign. But, Oh! Belford, had ſhe had but the leaſt patience with me—Had ſhe but made me think, that ſhe would forgive this initiatory ardor— Surely ſhe will not be always thus guarded.—</p>
                     <p>I had not been a moment by myſelf, but I was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that I had half-forfeited my newly-aſſumed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. It is exceedingly difficult, thou ſeeſt, for an honeſt man to act in diſguiſes: As the Poet ſays, <hi>Thruſt Nature back with a pitchfork, it will return.</hi> I recollected, that what ſhe had inſiſted upon, was really a part of that declared will, before ſhe left her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe, to which in another caſe (to humble her) I had pretended to have an inviolable regard. And when I remembred her words of <hi>Taking her meaſures accordingly,</hi> I was reſolved to ſacrifice a leg or an arm to make all up again, before ſhe had time to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine upon any new meaſures.</p>
                     <p>How ſeaſonably to this purpoſe have come in my Aunt's and Couſin's Letters!</p>
                     <p>I HAVE ſent in again and again to implore her to admit me to her preſence, But ſhe will conclude a Letter ſhe is writing to Miſs Howe, before ſhe will ſee me—I ſuppoſe to give an account of what has juſt paſſed.</p>
                     <p>CURSE upon her perverſe tyranny! How ſhe makes me wait for an humble audience, though ſhe has done writing ſome time! A Prince begging for her upon his knees ſhould not prevail upon me to ſpare her, if I can but get her to London—Oons! Jack, I believe I have bit my lip through for vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation!—But one day <hi>hers</hi> ſhall ſmart for it.</p>

If it will provoke <hi>you</hi> to demand your own in a legal way, I wiſh they would; ſince their putting you upon that courſe will juſtify the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of your leaving them. And as it is not for your credit to own, that you were tricked away con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your intention, this would afford a reaſon for your going off, that I ſhould make very good uſe of. You'll ſee, that I approve of Lovelace's advice upon this ſubject.

                     <p>You muſt be the leſs ſurpriſed at the inventions of this man, becauſe of his uncommon talents. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had turned his head to, he would have excelled in; or been (or done things) extraordinary. He is ſaid to be revengeful: A very bad quality! I believe indeed he is a devil in every-thing but his foot.—This therefore is my repeated advice — Provoke him not too much againſt yourſelf: But unchain him, and let him looſe upon your Siſter's vile Betty, and your Brother's Joſeph Leman.

                           <p>THIS is to let your Honner kno', as how I have been emploied in a biſneſs I would have been excuſed from, if ſo be I could. For it is to gitt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe from a young man, who is of late com'd out to be my Cuzzen by my Granmother's ſide; and but lately come to live in theſe partes, about a verry vile thing, as younge maſter calls it, relating to your Honner. God forbid I ſhould call it ſo without your leafe. It is not for ſo plane a man as I be, to tacks
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0041800508:55"/>
my betters. It is conſarning one Miſs Batirton, of Notingam; a very pritty crature, belike.</p>
                           <p>Your Honner got her away, it ſeems, by a falſe Letter to her, macking believe as howe her She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuzzen that ſhe derely loved, was coming to ſee her; and was tacken ill upon the rode: And ſo Miſs Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirton ſet out in a Shaſe, and one ſarvant, to fet her Cuzzen from the Inne where ſhe laid ſick, as ſhe thote: And the ſarvant was tricked, and braute back the Shaſe; but Miſs Batirton was not harde of for a month, or ſo. And when it came to paſſe, that her frends found her oute, and would have proſſekutid your Honner, your Honner was gone abroad: And ſo ſhe was broute to bed, as one may ſay, before your Honner's return: And ſhe got colde in her lyin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inn, and lanquitched, and ſoon died: And the child is living; but your Honner never troubles your Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's hedd about it in the leaſt. And this and ſome ſuch other matters of verry bad reporte, Squier Solmes was to tell my young Lady of, if ſo be ſhe would have harde him ſpeke, before we loſt her ſweet company, as I may ſay, from heere <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. ii. Edit. i. p. 81—83. Edit. ii. p. 79—81.</note>.</p>
                           <p>I hope your Honner will excuſe me: But I was forſed to tell all I harde, becauſe they had my Cuzzen in to them, and he would have ſaid he had tolde me: So could not be melely-mouthed, for fere to be blone up, and pleſe your Honner.</p>
                           <p>Your Honner helped me to a many ugly ſtories to tell againſt your Honner to my younge Maſter, and younge Miſtriſs; butt did not tell me about this.</p>
                           <p>I moſt humbelly beſeche your Honner to be good and kinde and fethful to my deareſt younge Lady, now you have her; or I ſhall brake my harte for having done ſome dedes that have helped to bring things to this paſſe. Pray youre dere good Honner, be juſt! Prayey do!—As God ſhall love ye! prayey do!—I cannot write no more for this preſſent, for verry fear and grief—</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0041800508:56"/>But now I am cumm'd to my writing agen, will youre Honner be pleſed to tell me, if as how there be any danger to your Honner's life from this biſneſs; for my Cuzzen is actlie hier'd to go down to Miſs Batirton's frendes to ſee if they will ſtur in it: For you muſt kno' your Honner, as how he lived in the Batirton family at the time, and could be a good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe, and all that.</p>
                           <p>I hope it was not ſo verry bad, as Titus ſays it was; for hee ſes as how there was a Rape in the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you at furſte, and pleſe your Honner; and my Cuzzen Titus is a very honiſt younge man as ever brocke bred. This is his carackter; and this made me willinger to owne him for my Relation, when we came to talck.</p>
                           <p>If there ſhould be danger of your Honner's life, I hope your Honner will not be hanged like as one of us common men: Only have your hedd cut off, or ſo: And yet it is pitty ſuch a hedd ſhould be loſſed: But if as how it ſhoulde be proſſekutid to that furr, which God forbid, be pleſed natheleſs to thinck of youre fethful Joſeph Leman, before your hedd be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; for after condemnation, as I have been told, all will be the King's, or the Shreeve's.</p>
                           <p>I thote as how it was beſt to acquent your Honner of this; and for you to let me kno' if I could do any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſarve your Honner, and prevent miſchef with my Cuzzen Titus, on his coming back from Nottingam, before he mackes his reporte.</p>
                           <p>I have gin him a hinte already: For what, as I ſed to him, Cuzzin Titus, ſignifies ſtirring up the coles, and macking of ſtrief, to make rich gentilfolkes live at varience, and to be cutting of throtes, and ſuch-like?</p>
                           <p>Verry trewe, ſed little Titus. And this and pleſe your Honner gis me hopes of him, if ſo be your Honner gis me directions: ſen', as God kno'es, I have a poor, a verry poor invenſhon; only a willing mind
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0041800508:57"/>
to prevent miſchef, that is the chief of my aim, and always was, I bleſs my God!—Els I could have made mutch miſchef in my time; as indeed any ſarvant may. Your Honner natheleſs praiſes my invenſhon every now-and-then: Alas! and pleſe your Honner, what invenſhon ſhould ſuche a plane man as I have?— But when your Honner ſets me agoing by <hi>your</hi> fine invenſhon, I can do well enuff. And I am ſure I have a hearty good will to deſerve your Honner's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if I mought.</p>
                           <p>Two days, as I may ſay, off and on, have I been writing this long Letter. And yet I have not ſed all I would ſay. For, be it knone unto your Honner, as how I do not like that Capten Singelton, which I told you of <hi>in my two laſt Letters.</hi> He is always lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hedd and my young Maſter's hedd together; and I ſuſpect much if ſo be ſome miſchef is not going on between them: And ſtill the more, as becauſe my eldeſt young Lady ſemes to be joined to them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
                           <p>Laſt week my young maſter ſed before my faſe, <hi>My harte's blood boiles over, Capten Singelton, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon this</hi>—And he called your Honner by a name it is not for ſuch a won as me to ſay what. Capten Singelton whiſpred my younge Maſter, being I was by. So younge Maſter ſed, <hi>You may ſay any-thing before Joſeph; for althoff he looks ſo ſeellie, he has as good a harte, and as good a hedd, as any ſarvante in the worlde nede to have.</hi> My conſcience touched me juſt then. But why ſhoulde it? when all I do, is to prevente miſcheff; and ſeing your Honner has ſo much patience, which younge Maſter has not; ſo am not affeard of telling your Honner any-thing whatſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                           <p>And furthermore, I have ſuche a deſire to deſarve your Honner's bounty to me, as mackes me let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing paſs I can tell you of, to prevent harm: And too beſides your Honner's goodneſs about the Blew
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0041800508:58"/>
Bore; which I have ſo good an accounte of!—I am ſure I ſhall be bounden to bleſs your Honner the longeſt day I have to live.</p>
                           <p>And then the Blew Bore is not all neither; ſen', and pleſe your Honner, the pretty Sowe (God forgive me for geſting in ſo ſerus a matter) runs in my hedd likewiſe. I believe I ſhall love her mayhap more than your Honner would have me; for ſhe begins to be kind and good-humered, and liſtens, and pleſe your Honner, licke as <hi>if ſhe was among beans,</hi> when I talke about the Blew Bore, and all that.</p>
                           <p>Prayey your Honner forgive the geſting of a poor plane man. We common fokes have our joys, and pleſe your Honner, lick as our betters have; and if we be ſometimes ſnubbed, we can find our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to ſnub them agen: And if not, we can get a Wife mayhap, and ſnub her: So are Maſters ſome how or other ourſells.</p>
                           <p>But how I try your Honner's patience!—Sarvants will ſhow their joiful hartes, tho'ff but in partinens, when encouredg'd.</p>
                           <p>Be pleſed from the prems's to let me kno' if as how I can be put upon any ſarvice to ſarve your Honner, and to ſarve my deereſt younge Lady; which God grant! For I begin to be affearde for her, hearing what pepel talck—To be ſure your Honner will not do her no <hi>harme,</hi> as a man may ſay. But I kno' your Honner muſt be good to ſo wonderous a younge Lady. How can you help it?—But heere my conſcience ſmites me, that <hi>but for ſome of my ſtories, which your Honner taute me, my old Maſter and my old Lady, and the two old Squiers, would not have been abell to be half ſo hard-harted as they be, for all what my young Maſter and young Miſtreſs ſayes.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And here is the ſad thing; they cannot come to clere up matters with my deereſt young Lady, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as <hi>your Honner has ordered it,</hi> they have theſe ſtories as if bribed by me out of your Honner's ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0041800508:59"/>
which muſt not be known, for fere you ſhould kill'n and me too, and blacken the briber!—Ah! your Honner!—I doute as that I am a very vild fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low (Lord bleſs my ſoul, I pray God) and did not intend it.</p>
                           <p>But if my deereſt young Lady ſhould come to harm, and pleſe your Honner, the horſepond at the Blew Bore—But Lord preſerve us all from all bad miſcheff, and all bad endes, I pray the Lord!—For tho'ff your Honner is kinde to me in worldly pelff, yet <hi>what ſhall a man get to loos his ſoul,</hi> as holy Skrittuer ſays, and pleſe your Honner?</p>
                           <p>But natheleſs I am in hope of reppentance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, being but a younge man, if I do wrong thro' ignorrens; your Honner being a grate man, and a grate wit; and I a poor crature, not worthy notice; and your Honner able to anſwer for all.

                           <p>YOU have a worſe opinion of your invention than you ought to have. I muſt praiſe it again. Of a plain man's head I have not known many better than yours. How often have your forecaſt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion anſwered my wiſhes in caſes which I could not foreſee, not knowing how my general directions would ſucceed, or what might happen in the execution of them! You are too doubtful of your own abilities, honeſt Joſeph; that's your fault. But it being a fault that is owing to natural <hi>modeſty,</hi> you ought rather to be <hi>pitied</hi> for it than <hi>blamed.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The affair of Miſs Betterton was a youthful fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. I love dearly to exerciſe my invention. I do
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0041800508:60"/>
aſſure you, Joſeph, that I have ever had more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in my Contrivances than in the End of them. I am no ſenſual man; but a man of ſpirit—One wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is like another—<hi>You underſtand me, Joſeph</hi>—In Courſing all the ſport is made by the winding Hare. A barn-door Chick is better eating. <hi>Now you take me, Joſeph.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Miſs Betterton was but a Tradeſman's daughter. The family indeed were grown rich, and aimed at a new Line of Gentry; and were unreaſonable enough to expect a man of my family would marry her. I was honeſt. I gave the young Lady no hope of that; for ſhe put it to me. She reſented: Kept up, and was kept up. A little innocent Contrivance was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to get her out—But no Rape in the caſe, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, Joſeph—She loved me: I loved her. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when I got her to the Inn, I aſked her no queſtions. It is cruel to aſk a modeſt woman for her conſent. It is creating difficulties to both. Had not her friends been officious, I had been conſtant and faithful to her to this day, as far as I know—For then I had not known my Angel.</p>
                           <p>I went not abroad upon <hi>her</hi> account. She loved me too well to have appeared againſt me. She refuſed to ſign a paper they had drawn up for her, to found a proſecution upon: And the brutal creatures would not permit the midwife's aſſiſtance, till her life was in danger; and I believe to this her death was owing.</p>
                           <p>I went into mourning for her, tho' abroad at the time. A diſtinction I have ever paid to thoſe worthy creatures who died in Childbed by me.</p>
                           <p>I was ever nice in my Loves. Theſe were the rules I laid down to myſelf on my entrance into active life: To ſet the mother above want, if her friends were cruel, and if I could not get her an huſband worthy of her: To ſhun common women: A piece of juſtice I owed to innocent Ladies, as well as to myſelf: To marry off a former miſtreſs, if poſſible,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0041800508:61"/>
before I took to a new one: To maintain a Lady handſomely in her lying-in: To provide for the Little one, if it lived, according to the degree of its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: To go into mourning for the mother, if ſhe died. And the promiſe of this was a great comfort to the pretty dears, as they grew near their times.</p>
                           <p>All my errors, all my expences, have been with and upon women. So I could acquit my conſcience (acting thus honourably by them) as well as my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion as to point of fortune.</p>
                           <p>All men love women: And find me a man of more honour in theſe points, if you can, Joſeph.</p>
                           <p>No wonder the Sex love me as they do!</p>
                           <p>But <hi>now</hi> I am ſtrictly virtuous. I am reformed. So I have been for a long, long time: Reſolving to marry, as ſoon as I can prevail upon the moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of women to have me. I think of nobody elſe. It is impoſſible I ſhould. I have ſpared very pretty girls for her ſake. Very true, Joſeph! So ſet your honeſt heart at reſt—You ſee the pains I take to ſatisfy your qualms.</p>
                           <p>But as to Miſs Betterton—No Rape in the caſe, I repeat: Rapes are unnatural things: And more <hi>rare</hi> than are imagined, Joſeph—I ſhould be loth to be put to ſuch a ſtreight. I never was. Miſs Betterton was taken from me againſt her own will. In that caſe, her friends, not I, committed the Rape.</p>
                           <p>I have contrived to ſee the Boy twice, unknown to the Aunt, who takes care of him; loves him; and would not now part with him, on any conſideration. The Boy is a fine Boy, I thank God. No Father need be aſhamed of him. He will be well provided for. If not, I would take care of him. He will have his Mother's fortune. They curſe the Father, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful wretches! but bleſs the Boy—Upon the whole, there is nothing vile in this matter on my ſide; a great deal on the Bettertons.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore, Joſeph, be not thou in pain, either
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0041800508:62"/>
for <hi>my</hi> head, or for <hi>thy own</hi> neck; nor for the Blue Boar; nor for thy pretty Sow.—</p>
                           <p>I love your jeſting. Jeſting better becomes a poor man than qualms.—I love to have you jeſt. All we ſay, all we do, all we wiſh for, is a jeſt. He that makes life itſelf not ſo, is a ſad fellow, and has the worſt of it.</p>
                           <p>I doubt not, Joſeph, but you have had your joys, as you ſay, as well as your betters. May you have more and more, honeſt Joſeph!—He that grudges a poor man joy, ought to have none himſelf. Jeſt on therefore: Jeſting, I repeat, better becomes thee than qualms.</p>
                           <p>I had no <hi>need</hi> to tell you of Miſs Betterton: Did I not furniſh you with ſtories enough without hers, againſt myſelf, to augment your credit with your cunning maſters? Beſides, I was loth to mention Miſs Better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, her friends being all living, and in credit. I loved her too; for ſhe was taken from me by her cruel friends while our joys were young.</p>
                           <p>But enough of dear Miſs Betterton. <hi>Dear,</hi> I ſay; for death <hi>endears.</hi>—Reſt to her worthy ſoul!—There, Joſeph, off went a deep ſigh to the memory of Miſs Betterton!</p>
                           <p>As to the journey of little Titus [I now recollect the fellow by his name] Let that take its courſe: A Lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago; no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs begun in her life-time; refuſing herſelf to give evidence againſt me whilſt ſhe lived—Pretty circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to found an indictment for a Rape upon!</p>
                           <p>As to your young Lady, the ever-adorable Miſs Clariſſa Harlowe, I always courted her for a Wife. Others rather expected marriage from the vanity of their own hearts, than from my promiſes. For I was always careful of what I promiſed. You know, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, that I have gone beyond my promiſes to <hi>you.</hi> I do to every-body: And why? Becauſe it is the beſt way of ſhewing, that I have no grudging or narrow
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0041800508:63"/>
ſpirit. A promiſe is an obligation. <hi>A juſt man will keep his promiſe: A generous man will go beyond it.</hi> This is my rule.</p>
                           <p>If you doubt my honour to your young Lady, it is more than ſhe does. She would not ſtay with me an hour if ſhe did. Mine is the ſteadieſt heart in the world. Haſt thou not reaſon to think it ſo?—Why this ſqueamiſhneſs then, honeſt Joſeph?</p>
                           <p>But it is becauſe thou <hi>art</hi> honeſt: So I forgive thee. Whoever loves my divine Clariſſa, loves me.</p>
                           <p>Let James Harlowe call me what Names he will. For his Siſter's ſake I will bear them. Do not be concerned for me. Her favour will make me rich amends. His own vilely malicious heart will make his blood <hi>boil over</hi> at any time: And when it does, thinkeſt thou that I will let it touch my conſcience? —And if not <hi>mine,</hi> why ſhould it touch <hi>thine?</hi> Ah! Joſeph, Joſeph! What a fooliſh teazer is thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience! Such a conſcience, as gives a plain man trouble, when he intends to do for the beſt, is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not conſcience.</p>
                           <p>But ſay what thou wilt, write all thou knoweſt or heareſt of, to me: Ill have patience with every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body. Why ſhould I not, when it is as much the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of my heart, as it is of thine, to prevent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief?</p>
                           <p>So now, Joſeph, having taken all this pains to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy thy Conſcience, and anſwer all thy doubts, and to baniſh all thy fears; let me come to a <hi>new point.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Your endeavours and mine, which were deſigned, <hi>by round-about ways,</hi> to reconcile all, even againſt the wills of the moſt obſtinate, have not, we ſee, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the end we hoped they would anſwer; but, on the contrary, have widened the unhappy differences between our families. But this has not been either your fault or mine: It is owing to the black pitch-like blood of your venomous-hearted young Maſter, <hi>boiling over,</hi> as he owns, that our honeſt wiſhes have hitherto been fruſtrated.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0041800508:64"/>Yet we muſt proceed in the ſame courſe: We ſhall tire them out in time, and they will propoſe terms; and when they do, they ſhall find how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable mine ſhall be, little as they deſerve from me.</p>
                           <p>Perſevere, therefore, Joſeph; honeſt Joſeph, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere; and, unlikely as you may imagine the means, our deſires will be at laſt obtained.</p>
                           <p>We have nothing for it now, but to go thro' with our work in the way we have begun. For ſince (as I told you in my laſt) my Beloved miſtruſts you, ſhe will blow you up, if ſhe be <hi>not</hi> mine. If ſhe <hi>be,</hi> I can and will protect you; and as, if there will be any fault, in her opinion, it will be rather mine than yours, ſhe <hi>muſt</hi> forgive you, and keep her huſband' ſecrets, for the ſake of his reputation: Elſe ſhe will be guilty of a great failure in her duty. So, now you have ſet your hand to the plough, Joſeph, there is no looking back.</p>
                           <p>And what is the conſequence of all this? One la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour more, and that will be all that will fall to your lot; at leaſt of conſequence.</p>
                           <p>My beloved is reſolved not to think of Marriage till ſhe has tried to move her friends to a Reconciliation with her. You know they are determined not to be reconciled. She has it in her head, I doubt not, to make me ſubmit to the people I hate; and if I did, they would rather inſult me, than receive my conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion as they ought. She even owns, that ſhe will renounce me, if they inſiſt upon it, provided they will give up Solmes. So, to all appearance, I am ſtill as far as ever from the happineſs of calling her mine: Indeed I am more likely than ever to loſe her (if I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive ſome way to avail myſelf of the preſent critical ſituation); and then, Joſeph, all I have been ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying, and all you have been doing, will ſignify no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                           <p>At the place where we are, we cannot long be private. The lodgings are inconvenient for us, while
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0041800508:65"/>
both together, and while the refuſes to marry. She wants to get me at a diſtance from her. There are extraordinary convenient lodgings in my eye in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where we could be private, and all miſchief avoided. When <hi>there</hi> (if I <hi>get</hi> her thither) ſhe will inſiſt, that I ſhall leave her. Miſs Howe is for ever putting her upon contrivances. That, you know, is the reaſon I have been obliged, by your means, to play the family off at Harlowe-Place upon Mrs. Howe, and Mrs. Howe upon her Daughter—Ah! Joſeph!— Little need for your fears for my Angel: <hi>I</hi> only am in danger—But were I the free liver I am reported to be, all this could I get over with a wet finger, as the ſaying is.</p>
                           <p>But, by the help of one of your hints, I have thought of an Expedient which will do every-thing, and raiſe your reputation, tho' already ſo high, higher ſtill. This Singleton, I hear, is a fellow who loves enterpriſing: The view he has to get James Harlowe to be his principal owner in a larger veſſel which he wants to be put into the command of, may be the ſubject of their preſent cloſe converſation. But ſince he is taught to have ſo good an opinion of you, Joſeph <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. iii. p. 234—236. of the firſt Edition, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of this Letter.</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

You two might indeed have raqueted the Ball betwixt you, as you ſay: But Mr. Hickman, by his gentle manners,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0041800508:67"/>
ſeems formed for you, if you go not too far with him. If you do, it would be a tameneſs in him to bear it, which would make a man more contemptible than Mr. Hickman can ever deſerve to be made. Nor is it a diſgrace for even a brave man, who knows what a woman is to vow to him <hi>afterwards,</hi> to be very obſequious <hi>beforehand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Do you think it is to the credit of Mr. Lovelace's character, that he can be offenſive and violent?

                     <p>Let me tell you, my dear, that Mr. Hickman is ſuch a one, as would rather bear an affront <hi>from</hi> a Lady, than offer one <hi>to</hi> her.

                     <p>What doſt think?—Here this little devil Sally, not being able, as ſhe told me, to ſupport life under my diſpleaſure, was going into a fit: But when I ſaw her <hi>preparing</hi> for it, I went out of the room; and ſo ſhe thought it would not be worth her while to ſhew away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In this manner he mentions what his meaning was in making the Lady the compliment of his abſence:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to leaving her; If I go but for <hi>one</hi> night, I have fulfilled my promiſe: And if ſhe think not, I can mutter and grumble, and yield again, and make a merit of it; and then, unable to live out of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſoon return. Nor are women ever angry at bottom for being diſobey'd thro' exceſs of Love. They lik an uncontroulable paſſion. They like to have every favour raviſhed from them; and to be eaten and drank quite up by a voracious Lover. Don't I know the Sex?—Not ſo, indeed, as yet, my Clariſſa: But however, with <hi>her</hi> my frequent egreſſes will make me look new to her, and create little buſy ſcenes between us. At the leaſt I may ſurely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, ſalute her at parting, and at return; and will not thoſe occaſional freedoms (which civility will warrant) by degrees familiarize my charmer to them?</p>
                     <p>But here, Jack, what ſhall I do with my Uncle and Aunts, and all my loving Couſins? For I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that they are more in haſte to have me married than I am myſelf.</p>

                        <hi>Mr. Lovelace in his next Letter gives an account of his quick return: Of his reaſons to the Lady for it: Of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0041800508:72"/>
her diſpleaſure upon it: And of her urging his abſence from the ſafety ſhe was in from the ſituation of the houſe, except ſhe were to be traced out by his viſits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I was confoundedly puzzled, <hi>ſays he,</hi> on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and on her inſiſting upon the execution of a too-ready offer which I made her to go down to Berks, to bring up my Couſin Charlotte to viſit and attend her. I made miſerable excuſes; and, fearing that they would be mortally reſented, as her paſſion began to riſe upon my ſaying Charlotte was delicate, which ſhe took ſtrangely wrong, I was obliged to ſcreen myſelf behind the moſt ſolemn and explicit declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He then repeats thoſe declarations, to the ſame effect with the account ſhe gives of them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I began, <hi>ſays he,</hi> with an intention to keep my Life of Honour in view, in the declarations I made her; but, as it has been ſaid of a certain orator in the Houſe of Commons, who more than once, in a long ſpeech, convinced himſelf as he went along, and concluded againſt the ſide he ſet out intending to favour, ſo I in earneſt preſſed without reſerve for Matrimony in the progreſs of my harangue, which ſtate I little thought of urging upon her with ſo much ſtrength and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He then values himſelf upon the delay that his propoſal of taking and furniſhing a houſe muſt occaſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He wavers in his reſolutions whether to act honourably or not, by a merit ſo exalted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He values himſelf upon his own delicacy, in expreſſing his indignation againſt her friends, for ſuppoſing what he pretends his heart riſes againſt them for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming to ſuppoſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But have I not reaſon, <hi>ſays he,</hi> to be angry with her, for not praiſing me for this my delicacy, when ſhe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0041800508:73"/>
is ſo ready to call me to account for the leaſt failure in punctilio? However, I believe I can excuſe her too, upon this generous conſideration [For <hi>generous</hi> I am ſure it is, becauſe it is againſt myſelf]; that her mind being the eſſence of delicacy, the leaſt want of it ſhocks her; while the meeting with what is ſo very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary to <hi>me,</hi> is too familiar to <hi>her</hi> to obtain her notice, <hi>as</hi> an extraordinary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He glories in the ſtory of the houſe, and of the young Widow poſſeſſor of it, Mrs. Fretchville he calls her; and leaves it doubtful to Mr. Belford, whether it be a real or fictitious ſtory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He mentions his different propoſals in relation to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, which he ſo earneſtly preſſed for; and owns his artful intention in avoiding to name the day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now, <hi>ſays he,</hi> I hope ſoon to have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to begin my operations; ſince all is <hi>Halcyon</hi> and Security.</p>
                     <p>It is impoſſible to deſcribe the dear Creature's ſweet and ſilent confuſion, when I touched upon the matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial topics.</p>
                     <p>She <hi>may</hi> doubt. She <hi>may</hi> fear. The wiſe in all important caſes will doubt, and will fear, till they are ſure. But her apparent willingneſs to think well of a ſpirit ſo inventive and ſo machinating, is a happy prognoſtic for me. O theſe reaſoning Ladies!— How I love theſe reaſoning Ladies!—'Tis all over with them, when once Love has crept into their hearts: For then will they employ all their reaſoning powers to <hi>excuſe,</hi> rather than to <hi>blame,</hi> the conduct of the <hi>doubted</hi> Lover, let appearances againſt him be ever ſo ſtrong.</p>
                     <p>Mowbray, Belton, and Tourville, long to ſee my angel, and will be there. She has <hi>refuſed</hi> me; but <hi>muſt be preſent</hi> notwithſtanding. So generous a ſpirit as mine is cannot enjoy its happineſs without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0041800508:74"/>
If I raiſe not your envy and admiration both at once, but half-joy will be the joy of having ſuch a charming Fly entangled in my web. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt comply.

                     <p>Ye muſt be ſure <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Theſe inſtructions are given at large, Vol. iii. p. 318—322. of the 2d Edition.</note> to let it ſink deep into your heavy heads, that there is no ſuch Lady in the world, as Miſs Clariſſa Harlowe; and that ſhe is neither more nor leſs than Mrs. Lovelace, though at preſent, to my ſhame be it ſpoken, a Virgin.</p>
                     <p>Be mindful alſo, that your old Mother's name, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that of <hi>her</hi> Mother when a Maid, is Sinclair: That her Huſband was a Lieutenant-colonel, and all that <hi>you,</hi> Belford, know from honeſt Doleman's Letter of her <note n="(c)" place="bottom">See Vol. iii. Edit. i. p. 184, &amp; ſeq. and Edit. ii. p. 183, &amp; ſeq.</note>, that let your brethren know.</p>
                     <p>Mowbray and Tourville, the two greateſt blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of the four, I allow to be acquainted with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0041800508:75"/>
the Widow and Nieces, from the knowlege they had of the Colonel. They will not forbear familiarities of ſpeech to the Mother, as of longer acquaintance than a day. So I have ſuited their parts to their capacities.</p>
                     <p>They may praiſe the Widow and the Colonel for people of great honour—But not too groſly; nor to labour the point ſo as to render themſelves ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>The Mother will lead ye into her own and the Colonel's praiſes; and Tourville and Mowbray may be both her vouchers—I, and you, and Belton, muſt be only hearſay confirmers.</p>
                     <p>As poverty is generally ſuſpectible, the Widow muſt be got handſomely aforehand; and no doubt but ſhe <hi>is.</hi> The elegance of her houſe and furniture, and her readineſs to diſcharge all demands upon her, which ſhe does with oſtentation enough, and which makes her neighbours, I ſuppoſe, like her the better, demonſtrate this. She will propoſe to do handſome things by her two Nieces. Sally is near Marriage— with an eminent Woolen-draper in the Strand, if ye have a mind to it; for there are five or ſix of them there.</p>
                     <p>The Nieces may be enquired after, ſince they will be abſent, as perſons reſpected by Mowbray and Tourville, for their late worthy Uncle's ſake.</p>
                     <p>Watch ye diligently every turn of my counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; every motion of my eye; for in my eye, and in my countenance, will ye find a ſovereign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulator. I need not bid ye reſpect me mightily: Your allegiance obliges ye to that: And who that ſees me, reſpects me not?</p>
                     <p>Priſcilla Partington (for her looks ſo innocent, and diſcretion ſo deep, yet ſeeming ſo ſoftly) may be greatly relied upon. She will accompany the Mother, gorgeouſly dreſſed, with all her Jew's extravagance flaming out upon her; and firſt <hi>induce,</hi> then <hi>counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> the Lady. She has her cue, and I hope will make her acquaintance coveted by my Charmer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0041800508:76"/>Miſs Partington's hiſtory is this: The Daughter of Col. Sinclair's Brother-in-law: That Brother-in-law may have been a Turky merchant, or any merchant, who died confoundedly rich: The Colonel one of her guardians [<hi>Collateral credit in that to the Old one]:</hi> Whence ſhe always calls Mrs. Sinclair <hi>Mamma</hi>; tho' not ſucceeding to the truſt.</p>
                     <p>She is juſt come to paſs a day or two, and then to return to her ſurviving guardian's at Barnet.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Partington has ſuitors a little hundred (her Grandmother, an Alderman's Dowager, having left her a great additional fortune); and is not truſted out of her guardians houſe, without an old gouver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante noted for diſcretion, except to her Mamma Sinclair; with whom now-and-then ſhe is permitted to be for a week together.</p>
                     <p>Priſc. will Mamma-up Mrs. Sinclair, and will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to court her guardian to let her paſs a delightful week with her—Sir Edward Holden, he may as well be, if your ſhallow pates will not be clogged with too many circumſtantials. Lady Holden perhaps will come with her; for ſhe always delighted in her Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Sinclair's company; and talks of her, and her good management, twenty times a day.</p>
                     <p>Be it principally thy part, Jack, who art a parade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fellow, and aimeſt at wiſdom, to keep thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-varlets from blundering; for, as thou muſt have obſerved from what I have written, we have the moſt watchful and moſt penetrating Lady in the world to deal with: A Lady worth deceiving! But whoſe eyes will pierce to the bottom of your ſhallow ſouls the moment ſhe hears you open. Do thou therefore place thyſelf between Mowbray and Tourville: Their toes to be played upon and commanded by thine, if they go wrong: Thy elbows to be the miniſters of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
                     <p>As to your general behaviour; No hypocriſy!— I hate it: So does my Charmer. If I had ſtudied
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0041800508:77"/>
for it, I believe I <hi>could</hi> have been an hypocrite: But my general character is ſo well known, that I ſhould have been ſuſpected at once, had I aimed at making myſelf too white. But what neceſſity can there be for hypocriſy, unleſs the generality of the Sex were to <hi>refuſe</hi> us for our immoralities? The beſt of them love to have the credit of reforming us. Let the ſweet ſouls try for it: If they fail, their intent was good. That will be a conſolation to them. And as to <hi>us,</hi> our work will be the eaſier; our ſins the fewer: Since they will draw themſelves in with a very little of our help; and we ſhall ſave a parcel of curſed Falſhoods, and appear to be what we <hi>are</hi> both to Angels and Men. Mean time their very Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers will acquit us, and reproach them with their <hi>Self-do, Self-have</hi>; and as having <hi>erred againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi> and ventured againſt <hi>manifeſt appearances.</hi> What folly therefore for men of our character to be hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites!</p>
                     <p>Be ſure to inſtruct the reſt, and do thou thyſelf remember, not to talk obſcenely. You know I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver permitted any of you to talk obſcenely. Time enough for that, when ye grow old, and can ONLY talk. Beſides, ye muſt conſider Priſc's <hi>affected</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, my Goddeſs's <hi>real</hi> one. Far from obſcenity therefore, do not ſo much as touch upon the double Entendre. What! as I have often ſaid, cannot you touch a Lady's heart, without wounding her ear?</p>
                     <p>It is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> that ye ſhould appear worſe men than myſelf. You cannot help appearing ſo, you'll ſay. Well then, there will be the leſs reſtraint upon you—The leſs reſtraint, the leſs affectation.—And if Belton begins his favourite ſubject in behalf of <hi>keeping,</hi> it may make me take upon myſelf to oppoſe him: But fear not; I ſhall not give the argument all my force.</p>
                     <p>She muſt have ſome curioſity, I think, to ſee what ſort of men my companions are: She will not expect any of you to be ſaints. Are ye not men born to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0041800508:78"/>
conſiderable fortunes, altho' ye are not all of ye men of parts? Who is it in this mortal life, that <hi>wealth does not miſlead?</hi> And as it gives people the <hi>power of being miſchievous,</hi> does it not require great virtue to forbear the uſe of that power? Is not the devil ſaid to be the god of this world? Are we not children of this world? Well then!—Let me tell thee my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion—It is this: That, were it not for the <hi>poor</hi> and the <hi>middling,</hi> the world would probably, long ago, have been deſtroyed by fire from Heaven. Ungrateful wretches the reſt, thou wilt be apt to ſay, to make ſuch ſorry returns, as they generally do make, to the <hi>poor</hi> and the <hi>middling!</hi>

                              <p>MR. Lovelace in his laſt Letters having taken notice of the moſt material paſſages contained in this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the following Extracts from it are only inſerted.</p>
                              <p>She gives pretty near the ſame account that he does of what paſſed between them, on her reſolution to go to church; and of his propoſal of St. Paul's, and deſire of attending her. She praiſes his good behaviour there; as alſo the diſcourſe, and the preacher: Is pleaſed with its ſeaſonableneſs: Gives particulars of the converſation between them afterwards, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the good obſervations he makes upon the ſermon.</p>
                           </q>
                           <p>I am willing, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> to have hopes of him: But am ſo unable to know how to depend upon his ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for an hour together, that all my favourable accounts of him in this reſpect muſt be taken with allowance.</p>
                           <p>Being very much preſſed, I could not tell how to refuſe dining with the Widow and her Nieces this day. I am better pleaſed with them, than I ever thought I ſhould be. I cannot help blaming myſelf for my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to give ſevere cenſures, where reputation is concerned. Peoples ways, humours, conſtitutions, education, and opportunities allowed for, my dear, many perſons, as far as I know, may appear blameleſs, whom others of different humours and educations are
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0041800508:81"/>
too apt to blame; and who, from the ſame fault, may be as ready to blame <hi>them.</hi> I will therefore make it a rule to myſelf for the future, never to judge peremptorily on firſt appearances: But yet I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that theſe are not people I ſhould chuſe to be intimate with, or whoſe ways I can like: Altho', for the ſtations they are in, they may go thro' the world with tolerable credit.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Lovelace's behaviour has been ſuch, as makes me call this, ſo far as it is paſſed, an agreeable day. Yet when eaſieſt as to him, my ſituation with my friends takes place in my thoughts, and cauſes me many a tear.</p>
                           <p>I am the more pleaſed with the people of the houſe, becauſe of the perſons of rank they are acquainted with, and who viſit them.</p>

                           <p>I AM ſtill well pleaſed with Mr. Lovelace's beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. We have had a good deal of ſerious diſcourſe together. The man has really juſt and good notions. He confeſſes how much he is pleaſed with this day, and hopes for many ſuch. Nevertheleſs, he inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly warned me, that his unlucky vivacity might return: But he doubted not, that he ſhould be fixed at laſt by my example and converſation.</p>
                           <p>He has given me an entertaining account of the four gentlemen he is to meet to-morrow night: <hi>Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining,</hi> I mean, for his humorous deſcription of their perſons, manners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſuch a deſcription as is far from being to their praiſe: Yet he ſeemed rather to deſign to divert my melancholy it, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade them. I think at bottom, my dear, that he muſt be a good-natured man; but that he was ſpoiled young for want of check or controul.</p>
                           <p>I cannot but call this, my circumſtances conſidered, an happy day to the end of it. Indeed, my dear, I think I could prefer him to all the men I ever knew, were he but to be always what he has been this day.

You ſee how ready I am to own all you have charged me with, when I find myſelf out. It is a difficult thing, I believe, ſometimes, for a young creature that is able to deliberate with herſelf, to know when ſhe loves, or when ſhe hates: But I am reſolved, as much as poſſible, to be determined both in my hatred and love by <hi>actions,</hi> as <hi>they</hi> make the man worthy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.</p>

                     <p>To purſue the compariſon <note n="(a)" place="bottom">This paſſage is inſerted Vol. iii. p. 357—360. of the 2d Edit.</note>—If the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the captivated Lady be very great, ſhe will threaten, indeed, as I ſaid: She will even refuſe her ſuſtenance for ſome time, eſpecially if you entreat her much, and ſhe thinks ſhe gives you concern by her refuſal. But then the Stomach of the dear ſullen one will ſoon return. 'Tis pretty to ſee how ſhe comes to by degrees: Preſſed by appetite, ſhe will firſt ſteal, perhaps, a weeping morſel by herſelf; then be brought to piddle and ſigh, and ſigh and pid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, before you; now-and-then, if her viands be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury, ſwallowing with them a reliſhing tear or two: Then ſhe comes to eat and drink, to oblige you: Then reſolves to live for your ſake: Her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations will, in the next place, be turned into blandiſhments; her vehement upbraidings into gentle murmurings—How <hi>dare</hi> you, Traitor!—into How <hi>could</hi> you, deareſt? She will draw you to her, inſtead of puſhing you from her: No longer, with unſheathed claws, will ſhe reſiſt you; but, like a pretty, playful, wanton Kitten, with gentle paws and concealed ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, tap your cheek, and with intermingled ſmiles, and tears, and careſſes, implore your conſideration for her, and your <hi>conſtancy:</hi> All the favour ſhe then
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0041800508:83"/>
has to aſk of you!—And this is the time, were it given to man to confine himſelf to one object, to be happier every day than other.</p>
                     <p>Now, Belford, were I to go no farther than I have gone with my beloved Miſs Harlowe, how ſhall I know the difference between <hi>her</hi> and <hi>another</hi> bird? To let her fly now, what a pretty jeſt would that be! How do I know, except I try, whether ſhe may not be brought to ſing me a fine ſong, and to be as well contented as I have brought other birds to be, and very ſhy ones too?</p>
                     <p>But now let us reflect a little upon the confounded partiality of us human creatures. I can give two or three familiar, and, if they were <hi>not familiar,</hi> they would be <hi>ſhocking,</hi> inſtances of the cruelty both of men and women, with reſpect to other creatures, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as worthy as (at leaſt more innocent than) them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. By my Soul, Jack, there is more of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage in human nature than we are commonly aware of. Nor is it, after all, ſo much amiſs, that we ſometimes avenge the more innocent animals upon our own ſpecies.</p>
                     <p>To particulars.</p>
                     <p>How uſual a thing is it for women as well as men, without the leaſt remorſe, to enſnare, to cage, and torment, and even with burning knitting-needles to put out the eyes of the poor feather'd ſongſter [Thou ſeeſt I have not yet done with birds]; which however, in proportion to its bulk, has more life than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (for a bird is all ſoul) and of conſequence has as much feeling as the human creature! When at the ſame time, if an honeſt fellow, by the gentleſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, and the ſofteſt arts, has the good luck to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon a mew'd-up lady to countenance her own eſcape, and ſhe conſents to break cage, and be ſet a flying into the all-chearing air of liberty, Mercy on us! what an Outcry is generally raiſed againſt him!</p>
                     <p>Juſt like what you and I once ſaw raiſed in a paltry
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0041800508:84"/>
village near Chelmsford, after a poor hungry fox, who, watching his opportunity, had ſeized by the neck, and ſhouldered, a ſleek-feathered gooſe: At what time we beheld the whole vicinage of boys and girls, old men, and old women, all the furrows and wrinkles of the latter filled up with malice for the time; the old men armed with prongs, pitch-forks, clubs, and catſticks; the old women with mops, brooms, fire-ſhovels, tongs, and pokers; and the younger fry with dirt, ſtones, and brickbats, gathering as they ran like a ſnowball, in purſuit of the wind-outſtripping prowler; all the mongrel curs of the <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumjacencies</hi> yelp, yelp, yelp, at their heels, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleting the horrid chorus.</p>
                     <p>Remembreſt thou not this ſcene? Surely thou muſt. My imagination, inflamed by a tender ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy for the danger of the adventurous marauder, repreſents it to my eye, as if it were but yeſterday. And doſt thou not recollect how generouſly glad we were, as if our own caſe, that honeſt Reynard, by the help of a lucky ſtile, over which both old and young tumbled upon one another, and a winding courſe, eſcaped their brutal fury, and flying catſticks; and how, in fancy, we followed him to his undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered retreat; and imagined we beheld the intrepid thief enjoying his dear-earned purchaſe with a delight proportioned to his paſt danger?</p>
                     <p>I once made a charming little ſavage ſeverely repent the delight ſhe took in ſeeing her tabby favourite make cruel ſport with a pretty ſleek bead-eyed mouſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe devoured it. Egad, my Love, ſaid I to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as I ſat meditating the ſcene, I am determined to lie in wait for a fit opportunity to try how <hi>thou</hi> wilt like to be toſt over <hi>my</hi> head, and be caught again: How <hi>thou</hi> wilt like to be patted from me, and pulled to me. Yet will I rather give life than take it away, as this barbarous quadrupede has at laſt done by her prey. And after all was over between my girl and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0041800508:85"/>
me, I reminded her of the incident to which my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution was owing.</p>
                     <p>Nor had I at another time any mercy upon the daughter of an old Epicure, who had taught the girl, without the leaſt remorſe, to roaſt Lobſters alive; to cauſe a poor Pig to be whipt to death, to ſcrape Carp the contrary way of the ſcales, making them leap in the ſtew-pan, and dreſſing them in their own blood for ſawce. And this for luxury-ſake, and to provoke an appetite; which I had without ſtimulation, in my way, and that I can tell thee a very ravenous one.</p>
                     <p>Many more inſtances of the like nature could I give, were I to leave nothing to thyſelf, to ſhew that the beſt take the ſame liberties, and perhaps worſe, with ſome ſort of creatures, that we take with others; all <hi>creatures</hi> ſtill! and creatures too, as I have obſerved above, replete with ſtrong life, and ſenſible feeling!— If therefore people pretend to mercy, let mercy go thro' all their actions. I have read ſomewhere, <hi>That a merciful man is merciful to his beaſt.</hi>

                     <p>That the morals of this Lady cannot fail, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that will leſſen the guilt on both ſides. And if, when ſubdued, ſhe knows but how to middle the matter between Virtue, and Love, then will ſhe be a Wife for me: For already I am convinced, that there is not a woman in the world that is Love-proof and Plot-proof, if ſhe be not the perſon.</p>
                     <p>And now imagine (the Charmer overcome) thou ſeeſt me ſitting ſupinely croſs-kneed, reclining on my ſoffa, the god of Love dancing in my eyes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing in every mantling feature; the ſweet rogue, late ſuch a proud rogue, wholly in my power, moving up ſlowly to me, at my beck, with heaving ſighs, half-pronounced upbraidings from murmuring lips, her finger in her eye, and quickening her pace at my <hi>Come hither, Deareſt!</hi>

                     <p>If I could bring my Charmer to this, would it not be the Eligible of Eligibles?—Is it not worth trying for?—As I ſaid, I can marry her when I will. She <hi>can</hi> be nobody's but mine, neither for ſhame, nor by choice, nor yet by addreſs: For who, that knows my character, believes that the worſt ſhe dreads, is <hi>now</hi> to be dreaded?</p>

                           <p>O my dear! he is a fierce, a fooliſh, an inſolent creature!—And in truth, I hardly expect, that we <hi>can</hi> accommodate.

Since (and that without any reaſon, any pretence in the world for it) he is for breaking my ſpirit <hi>before</hi> I am his; and while I am, or ought to be [O my folly, that I am not!] in my own power.</p>
                           <p>Till I can know whether my friends will give me hope or not, I muſt do what I never ſtudied to do before in any caſe; that is, to try to keep this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence open: And yet it will make me look <hi>little in my own eyes</hi>; becauſe I ſhall mean by it more than I can own. But this is one of the conſequences of a ſtep I ſhall ever deplore!

My vanity and conceit, as far as I know, might have part in the inconſiderate meaſure: For does it not look as if I thought myſelf more capable of obviating difficulties, than any-body elſe of my family?</p>
                           <p>But you muſt not, my dear, ſuppoſe my heart to be ſtill a confederate with my eye. That deluded eye now clearly ſees its fault, and the miſled heart deſpiſes it for it. Hence the application I am making to my Uncle: Hence it is, that I can ſay (I think truly) that I would atone for my fault at any rate, even by the ſacrifice of a limb or two, if that would do.</p>

                     <p>Even Dorcas, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> appears leſs exceptionable to me than before, and I cannot but pity her for her neglected education, as it is matter of ſo much regret to <hi>herſelf:</hi> Elſe, there would not be much in it; as the Low and Illiterate are the moſt uſeful people in the commonwealth (ſince ſuch conſtitute the labouring part of the public); and as a Lettered Education but too generally ſets people above thoſe ſervile offices, by which the buſineſs of the world is carried on. Nor have I any doubt, that there are, take the world thro', twenty happy people among the Unlettered, to one among thoſe who have had a School Education.</p>
                     <p>This, however, concludes not againſt Learning or
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0041800508:100"/>
Letters; ſince one would wiſh to lift to ſome little diſtinction, and more genteel uſefulneſs, thoſe who have capacity, and whoſe Parentage one reſpects, or whoſe ſervices one would wiſh to reward.</p>
                     <p>Were my mind quite at eaſe, I could enlarge, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not unuſefully, upon this ſubject; for I have conſidered it with as much attention as my years, and little experience and obſervation, will permit.</p>
                     <p>But the extreme illiterateneſs and indocility of this maid are ſurpriſing, conſidering that ſhe wants not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitiveneſs, appears willing to learn, and, in other reſpects, has quick parts. This confirms to me what I have heard remarked, That there is a <hi>docible Seaſon,</hi> a Learning-time, as I may ſay, for every perſon, in which the mind may be led ſtep by ſtep, from the lower to the higher (year by year) to improvement. How induſtriouſly ought theſe Seaſons, as they offer, to be taken hold of, by Tutors, Parents, and other friends, to whom the cultivation of the genius of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and youth is committed; ſince, once elapſed, and no foundation laid, they hardly ever return!— And yet it muſt be confeſſed, that there are ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius's, which, like ſome fruits, ripen not till late. And Induſtry and Perſeverance will do prodigious things—But for a learner to have thoſe firſt rudiments to maſter, at twenty years of age ſuppoſe, which others are taught, and they themſelves might have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, at ten, what an up-hill labour!</p>
                     <p>Theſe kind of obſervations you have always wiſhed me to interſperſe, as they ariſe to my thoughts. But it is a ſign that my proſpects are a little mended, or I ſhould not, among ſo many more intereſting ones, that my mind has been of late filled with, have had heart's-eaſe enough to make them.</p>
                     <p>Let me give you my <hi>reflections</hi> on my more hopeful proſpects.</p>
                     <p>I am now, in the firſt place, better able to account for the delays about the houſe, than I was before—
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0041800508:101"/>
Poor Mrs. Fretchville!—Tho' I know her not, I pity her!—Next, it looks well, that he had appriſed the women (before this converſation with them) of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſtay in this houſe, after I was removed to the other. By the tone of his voice he ſeemed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the appearance this new delay would have with me.</p>
                     <p>So handſomely did Miſs Martin expreſs herſelf of me, that I am ſorry, methinks, that I judged ſo hardly of her, when I firſt came hither—Free people may go a great way, but not all the way: And as ſuch are generally unguarded, precipitate, and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the ſame quickneſs, changeableneſs, and <hi>ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of ſpirit, as I may call it, may intervene (if the heart be not corrupted) to recover them to thought and duty.</p>
                     <p>His reaſon for declining to go in perſon to bring up the Ladies of his family, while my Brother and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleton continue their machinations, carries no bad face with it; and one may the rather allow for <hi>their</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, that ſo proud a ſpirit as his ſhould attend them for this purpoſe, as he ſpeaks of them ſometimes as perſons of punctilio.</p>
                     <p>Other reaſons I will mention for my being eaſier in my mind than I was before I overheard this conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                     <p>Such as, the advice he has received in relation to Singleton's mate; which agrees but too well with what you, my dear, wrote to me in yours of May the 10th.</p>
                     <p>His not intending to acquaint <hi>me</hi> with it.</p>
                     <p>His cautions to the ſervants about the ſailor, if he ſhould come, and make enquiries about us.</p>
                     <p>His reſolution to avoid violence, were he to fall in either with my Brother, or this Singleton; and the eaſy method he has chalked out, in this caſe, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent miſchief; ſince I need only <hi>not to deny</hi> my being his. But yet I ſhould be exceedingly unhappy in my
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0041800508:102"/>
own opinion, to be driven into ſuch a tacit acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legement to any new perſons, till I am ſo, altho' I have been led (ſo much againſt my liking) to give countenance to the belief of the perſons below that we are married.</p>
                     <p>I think myſelf obliged, from what paſſed between Mr. Lovelace and me on Wedneſday, and from what I overheard him ſay, to conſent to go with him to the Play; and the rather, as he had the diſcretion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one of the Nieces to accompany me.</p>
                     <p>I cannot but acknowlege that I am pleaſed to find, that he has actually written to Lord M.</p>
                     <p>I have promiſed to give Mr. Lovelace an anſwer to his propoſals as ſoon as I have heard from you, my dear, on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>I hope that in my next Letter I ſhall have reaſon to confirm theſe favourable appearances. Favourable I muſt think them in the wreck I have ſuffered.</p>
                     <p>I hope, that in the trial which you hint may happen between <hi>me</hi> and <hi>myſelf</hi> (as you <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See before, p. 87.</note> expreſs it) if he ſhould ſo behave, as to oblige me to leave him, I ſhall be able to act in ſuch a manner, as to bring no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit upon myſelf in your eye; and that is all now that I have to wiſh for. But if I value him ſo much as you are pleaſed to ſuppoſe I do, the trial which you imagine will be ſo difficult to me, will not, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, be upon getting from him, when the means to effect my eſcape are lent me; but how I ſhall behave when got from him; and if, like the Iſraelites of old, I ſhall be ſo weak as to wiſh to return to my Egyptian bondage.</p>
                     <p>I think it will not be amiſs, notwithſtanding the preſent favourable appearances, that you ſhould perfect the ſcheme (whatever it be) which you tell me you have thought of, in order to procure for me an aſylum, in caſe of neceſſity. Mr. Lovelace is certainly a deep and dangerous man; and it is therefore but prudence
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0041800508:103"/>
to be watchful; and to be provided againſt the worſt. Lord bleſs me, my dear, how am I reduced!—Could I ever have thought to be in ſuch a ſituation, as to be obliged to ſtay with a man, of whoſe honour by me I could have but the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of a doubt!—But I will look forward, and hope the beſt.</p>
                     <p>I am certain, that your Letters are ſafe.—Be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly eaſy, therefore, on that head.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Lovelace will never be out of my company by his good-will; otherwiſe I have no doubt that I am miſtreſs of my goings-out and comings-in; and did I think it needful, and were I not afraid of my Brother, and Capt, Singleton, I would oftener put it to trial.</p>

But he muſt certainly have views in quarreling with me thus, which he dare not own!—Yet what can they be?—I am terrified but to think of what they may be!</p>
                     <p>Let me <hi>but</hi> get from him!—As to my reputation, if I leave him—That is already too much wounded for me, now, to be careful about any-thing, but how to act ſo, as that my own Heart ſhall not reproach me.

                     <p>I am puniſhed enough, enough mortified, for this my vanity—I hope, <hi>enough,</hi> if it ſo pleaſe the all-gracious Inflicter: Since now, I verily think, I more deſpiſe myſelf for my preſumptuous ſelf-ſecurity, as well as vanity, than ever I ſecretly vaunted myſelf on my good inclinations: <hi>Secretly,</hi> I ſay, however; for indeed I had not given myſelf leiſure to reflect, till I was thus mortified, how very imperfect I was; nor how much truth there is in what Divines tell us, That we ſin in our beſt performances.</p>
                     <p>But I was very young—But here let me watch over myſelf again: For in thoſe four words, <hi>I was very young,</hi> is there not a palliation couched, that were enough to take all efficacy from the diſcovery and confeſſion?</p>
                     <p>What ſtrange imperfect beings!—But <hi>Self</hi> here, which is at the bottom of all we do, and of all we wiſh, is the grand miſleader.</p>
                     <p>I will not apologize to you, my dear, for theſe grave reflections. Is it not enough to make the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy creature look into herſelf, and endeavour to detect herſelf, who, from ſuch an high Reputation, left to proud and preſumptuous Self, ſhould, by one thoughtleſs ſtep, be brought to the dreadful ſituation I am in?</p>
                     <p>Let me, however, look forward: To deſpond would be to add ſin to ſin. And whom have I to raiſe me up, whom to comfort me, if I deſert <hi>myſelf?</hi>— Thou, O Father! who, I hope, haſt not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, haſt not yet curſed me!—For I am thine!—It is fit that meditation ſhould ſupply the reſt.—</p>
                     <p>I WAS ſo diſguſted with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <p>AND now, that my Beloved ſeems ſecure in my net, for my project upon the vixen Miſs Howe, and upon her Mother: In which the officious prancer Hickman is to come in for a daſh.</p>
                           <p>But why upon her Mother, methinks thou aſkeſt; who, unknown to herſelf, has only acted, by thy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, thro' thy agent Joſeph Leman, upon the folly of old Tony the Uncle?</p>
                           <p>No matter for that: She believes ſhe acts upon her own judgment; and deſerves to be puniſhed for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to judgment, when ſhe has none.—Every living ſoul, but myſelf, I can tell thee, ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that treats either cruelly or diſreſpectfully ſo adored a Lady.—What a plague! is it not enough that ſhe is teazed and tormented in perſon by me?</p>
                           <p>I have already broken the matter to our three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates; as a <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> not a <hi>reſolved-on</hi> caſe indeed. And yet they know, that with me, in a piece of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, Execution, with its ſwifteſt feet, is ſeldom three paces behind Projection, which hardly ever limps neither.</p>
                           <p>MOWBRAY is not againſt it. It is a ſcheme, he ſays, worthy of us: And we have not done any-thing for a good while, that has made a noiſe.</p>
                           <p>BELTON indeed heſitates a little, becauſe matters go wrong between him and his Thomaſine; and the poor fellow has not the courage to have his ſore place probed to the bottom.</p>
                           <p>TOURVILLE has ſtarted a freſh game, and ſhrugs his ſhoulders, and ſhould not <hi>chuſe</hi> to go abroad at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>if I pleaſe.</hi> For I apprehend that (from the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the project) there will be a kind of neceſſity to travel, till all is blown over.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0041800508:109"/>TO ME, one country is as good as another; and I ſhall ſoon, I ſuppoſe, chuſe to quit this paltry Iſland; except the miſtreſs of my fate will conſent to cohabit at <hi>home</hi>; and ſo lay me under no neceſſity of <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing her into foreign parts.</hi> TRAVELLING, thou knoweſt, gives the Sexes charming opportunities of being familiar with one another. A very few days and nights muſt now decide all matters betwixt me and my fair Inimitable.</p>
                           <p>DOLEMAN, who can act in theſe cauſes only as chamber-counſel, will inform us by pen and ink [his right hand and right ſide having not yet been ſtruck, and the other ſide beginning to be ſenſible] of all that ſhall occur in our abſence.</p>
                           <p>As for THEE, we had rather have thy company than not; for, altho' thou art a wretched fellow at contrivance, yet art thou intrepid at execution. But as thy preſent engagements make thy attendance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, I am not for making thy part neceſſary to our ſcheme; but for leaving thee to come after us when abroad. I know thou canſt not long live without us.</p>
                           <p>The project, in ſhort, is this:—Mrs. Howe has an elder Siſter in the Iſle of Wight, who is lately a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; and I am well informed, that the Mother and Daughter have engaged, before the latter is married, to pay a viſit to this Lady, who is rich, and intends Miſs for her heireſs; and in the interim will make her ſome valuable preſents on her approaching Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials; which, as Mrs. Howe, who loves money more than any-thing but herſelf, told one of my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, would be <hi>worth fetching.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now, Jack, nothing more need be done, than to hire a little trim veſſel, which ſhall ſail a pleaſuring backward and forward to Portſmouth, Spithead, and the Iſle of Wight, for a week or fortnight before we enter upon our parts of the plot. And as Mrs. Howe will be for making the beſt bargain ſhe can for her paſſage, the maſter of the veſſel may have orders (as a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0041800508:110"/>
perquiſite allowed him by his owners) to take what ſhe will give; And the Maſter's name, be it what it will, ſhall be <hi>Ganmore</hi> on the occaſion; for I know a rogue of that name, who is not obliged to be of any country, any more than we.</p>
                           <p>Well, then, we will imagine them on board. I will be there in diſguiſe. They know not any of ye four—ſuppoſing (the ſcheme ſo inviting) that thou canſt be one.</p>
                           <p>'Tis plaguy hard, if we cannot <hi>find,</hi> or <hi>make,</hi> a ſtorm.</p>
                           <p>Perhaps they will be ſea-ſick: But whether they be or not, no doubt they will keep their Cabin.</p>
                           <p>Here will be Mrs. Howe, Miſs Howe, Mr. Hick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a Maid, and a Footman, I ſuppoſe; and thus we will order it:</p>
                           <p>I know it will be hard weather: I <hi>know</hi> it will: And before there can be the leaſt ſuſpicion of the matter, we ſhall be in ſight of Guernſey, Jerſey, Dieppe, Cherbourg, or any-whither on the French coaſt that it ſhall pleaſe us to agree with the winds to blow us: And then, ſecuring the footman, and the women being ſeparated, one of us, according to lots that may be caſt, ſhall overcome, either by perſuaſion or force, the maid-ſervant: That will be no hard taſk; and ſhe is a likely wench [I have ſeen her often]: One, Mrs. Howe; nor can there be much difficulty there; for ſhe is full of health and life, and has been long a Widow: Another [<hi>That,</hi> ſays the princely Lion, muſt be <hi>I!</hi>] the ſaucy Daughter; who will be too much frighted to make great reſiſtance [<hi>Violent</hi> ſpirits, in that Sex, are ſeldom <hi>true</hi> ſpirits—'Tis but where they <hi>can</hi>—]: And after beating about the coaſt for three or four days for recreation's ſake, and to make ſure work, and till we ſee our ſullen birds begin to eat and ſip, we will ſet them all aſhore where it will be moſt convenient; ſell the veſſel [To Mrs. Townſend's agents, with all my heart, or to ſome other
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0041800508:111"/>
Smugglers] or give it to Ganmore; and purſue our travels, and tarry abroad till all is huſhed up.</p>
                           <p>Now I know thou wilt make difficulties, as it is thy way; while it is mine to conquer them. My other vaſſals made theirs; and I condeſcended to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate them: As thus I will thine, firſt ſtating them for thee according to what I know of thy phlegm.</p>
                           <p>What, in the firſt place, wilt thou aſk, ſhall be done with Hickman? who will be in full parade of dreſs and primneſs, in order to ſhew the old Aunt what a deviliſh clever fellow of a Nephew ſhe is to have.</p>
                           <p>What!—I'll tell thee—Hickman, in good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, will leave the women in their Cabin—and, to ſhew his courage with his breeding, be upon deck—</p>
                           <p>Well, and ſuppoſe he is?</p>
                           <p>Suppoſe he is!—Why then I hope it is eaſy for Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, or any-body elſe, myſelf ſuppoſe in my pea-jacket and great watch-coat (if any other make a ſcruple to do it) while he ſtands in the way, gaping and ſtaring like a novice, to ſtumble againſt him, and puſh him overboard!—A rich thought!—Is it not, Belford?— He is certainly plaguy officious in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies correſpondence; and, I am informed, plays dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble between Mother and Daughter, in fear of both.— Doſt not ſee him. Jack?—I do—popping up and down, his wig and hat floating by him; and paddling, pawing, and daſhing, like a frighted mongrel— I am afraid he never ventured to learn to ſwim.</p>
                           <p>But thou wilt not drown the poor fellow; wilt thou?</p>
                           <p>No, no!—That is not neceſſary to the project—I hate to do miſchiefs ſupererogatory. The ſkiff ſhall be ready to ſave him, while the veſſel keeps its courſe: He ſhall be ſet on ſhore with the loſs of wig and hat only, and of half of his little wits, at the place where he embarked, or any-where elſe.</p>
                           <p>Well, but ſhall we not be in danger of being hanged
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0041800508:112"/>
for three ſuch enormous Rapes, altho' Hickman ſhould eſcape with only a bellyful of ſea-water?</p>
                           <p>Yes, to be ſure, when caught—But is there any likelihood of that?—Beſides, have we not been in danger before now, for worſe facts?—And what is there in being only in <hi>danger?</hi>— If we actually were to appear in open day in England before matters are made up, there will be greater likelihood, that theſe women will <hi>not</hi> proſecute, than that they <hi>will.</hi>—For my own part, I ſhould wiſh they <hi>may.</hi> Would not a brave fellow chuſe to appear in court to ſuch an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment, confronting women who would do credit to his attempt? The country is more merciful in <hi>theſe</hi> caſes, than in <hi>any others:</hi> I ſhould therefore like to put myſelf upon my country.</p>
                           <p>Let me indulge a few reflections upon what thou mayſt think the <hi>worſt</hi> that <hi>can</hi> happen. I will ſuppoſe that thou art one of us; and that all five are actually brought to tryal on this occaſion: How bravely ſhall we enter a court, <hi>I</hi> at the head of you, dreſſed out each man, as if to his wedding-appearance!—You are ſure of all the women, old and young, of your ſide—What brave fellows!—What fine gentlemen! —There goes a charming handſome man!—meaning me, to be ſure!—Who could find in their hearts to hang ſuch a gentleman as that! whiſpers one Lady, ſitting, perhaps, on the right hand of the Recorder [I ſuppoſe the ſcene to be in London]: While another diſbelieves that any woman could <hi>fairly</hi> ſwear againſt <hi>me.</hi> All will croud after <hi>me:</hi> It will be each man's happineſs (if ye ſhall chance to be baſhful) to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: I ſhall be found to be the greateſt criminal; and my ſafety, for which the general voice will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, will be yours.</p>
                           <p>But then comes the triumph of triumph, that will make the accuſed look up, while the accuſers are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with confuſion.</p>
                           <p>Make room there!—Stand by!—Give back!—
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0041800508:113"/>
One receiving a rap, another an elbow, half a ſcore a puſh apiece!—</p>
                           <p>Enter the ſlow-moving, hooded-faced, down-look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plaintiffs.—</p>
                           <p>And firſt the Widow, with a ſorrowful countenance, tho' half-veil'd, pitying her Daughter more than her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The people, the women eſpecially, who on this occaſion will be five-ſixths of the ſpectators, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her—You'd have the conſcience, would you, to have five ſuch brave gentlemen as theſe hanged for you know not what?</p>
                           <p>Next comes the poor maid—who perhaps had been raviſhed twenty times before; and had not appeared now, but for company-ſake; mincing, ſimpering, weeping, by turns; not knowing whether ſhe ſhould be ſorry or glad.</p>
                           <p>But every eye dwells upon Miſs!—See, ſee, the handſome gentleman bows to her!</p>
                           <p>To the very ground, to be ſure, I ſhall bow; and kiſs my hand.</p>
                           <p>See her confuſion! See! She turns from him!— Ay! that's becauſe it is in open court, cries an arch one!—While others admire her—Ay! that's a girl worth venturing one's neck for!</p>
                           <p>Then we ſhall be praiſed—Even the Judges, and the whole crouded Bench, will acquit us in their hearts; and every ſingle man wiſh he had been me! —The women, all the time, diſclaiming proſecution, were the caſe to be their own. To be ſure, Belford, the ſufferers cannot put half ſo good a face upon the matter as we.</p>

                           <p>The principal difference that ſtrikes me in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between us and the Mayor, the Embaſſador, the General, on <hi>their</hi> Gawdies, is, that the mob make a greater noiſe, a louder huzzaing, in the one caſe than in the other, which is called <hi>acclamation,</hi> and ends frequently in <hi>higher</hi> taſte, by throwing dead ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals at one another, before they diſperſe; in which they have as much joy, as in the former part of the triumph: While they will attend us with all the marks of an awful or ſilent (at moſt only a whiſpering) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; their mouths diſtended, as if ſet open with gags, and their voices generally loſt in goggle-eyed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
                           <p>Well, but ſuppoſe, after all, we are convicted; what have we to do, but in time make over our eſtates, that the ſheriffs may not revel in our ſpoils?— There is no fear of being hanged for ſuch a crime as this, while we have <hi>money</hi> or <hi>friends.</hi>—And ſuppoſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0041800508:116"/>
even the worſt, that two or three were to die, have we not a chance, each man of us, to eſcape? The devil's in 'em, if they'll hang Five for raviſhing Three!</p>
                           <p>I know I ſhall get off for one—were it but for family-ſake: And being a handſome fellow, I ſhall have a dozen or two of young maidens, all dreſſed in white, go to Court to beg my life—And what a pretty ſhew they will make, with their white hoods, white gowns, white petticoats, white ſcarves, white gloves, kneeling for me, with their white handkerchiefs at their eyes, in two pretty rows, as Majeſty walks thro' them, and nods my pardon for their ſakes!—And, if once pardoned, all is over: For, Jack, in a crime of this nature there lies no appeal, as in a murder.</p>
                           <p>So thou ſeeſt the worſt that can happen, ſhould we <hi>not</hi> make the Grand Tour upon this occaſion, but ſtay and take our tryals. But it is moſt likely, that they will not proſecute at all. If not, no riſque on our ſide will be run; only taking our pleaſure abroad, at the worſt; leaving friends tired of us, in order, after a time, to return to the ſame friends endeared to us, as we to them, by abſence.</p>
                           <p>This, Jack, is my ſcheme, at the firſt running. I know it is capable of improvement—For example: I can land theſe Ladies in France; whip over before they can get a paſſage back, or before Hickman can have recovered his fright; and ſo find means to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap my Beloved on board—And then all will be right; and I need not care if I were never to return to England.</p>
                           <q>Memorandum, To be conſidered of—Whether, in order to complete my vengeance, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to kidnap away either James Harlowe or Solmes? or both? A man, Jack, would not go into exile for nothing.</q>

                     <p>All that vexes me, in the midſt of my gloried in devices, is, that there is a ſorry fellow in the world, who has preſumed to queſtion, whether the prize, when obtained, is worthy of the pains it coſts me: Yet knows, with what patience and trouble a bird-man will ſpread an acre of ground with gins and ſnares; ſet up his ſtalking-horſe, his glaſſes; plant his decoy-birds, and invite the feathered throng by his whiſtle; and all his prize at laſt (the reward of early hours, and of a whole morning's pains) only a ſimple Linnet.</p>
                     <p>To be ſerious, Belford, I muſt acknowlege, that all our purſuits, from childhood to manhood, are only trifles of different ſorts and ſizes, proportioned to our years and views: But then is not a fine woman the nobleſt trifle, that ever was or could be obtained by man?—And to what purpoſe do we ſay <hi>obtained,</hi> if it be not in the way we wiſh for?—If a man is rather to be <hi>her</hi> prize, than ſhe <hi>his?</hi>

                     <p>But let me give thee a few particulars of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the <hi>circumrotation</hi> we took, while in the coach—She had received a Letter from Miſs Howe yeſterday, I preſumed?</p>
                     <p>She made no anſwer. How happy ſhould I think myſelf to be admitted into their correſpondence! I would joyfully make an exchange of communications.</p>
                     <p>So, tho' I hoped not to ſucceed by her conſent [and little did ſhe think I had ſo happily in part ſuccecded without it] I thought it not amiſs to urge for it, for ſeveral reaſons: Among others, that I might account
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0041800508:118"/>
to her for my conſtant employment at my pen; in order to take off her jealouſy, that <hi>ſhe</hi> was the ſubject of thy correſpondence and mine: And that I might juſtify <hi>my</hi> ſecrecy and <hi>uncommunicativeneſs</hi> by her <hi>own.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I proceeded therefore—That I loved Familiar-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-writing, as I had more than once told her, above all the ſpecies of writing: It was writing from the heart (without the fetters preſcribed by method or ſtudy) as the very word <hi>Cor-reſpondence</hi> implied. Not the heart only; the <hi>ſoul</hi> was in it. Nothing of body, when friend writes to friend; the mind impelling ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignly, the vaſſal-fingers. It was, in ſhort, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip recorded; friendſhip given under hand and ſeal; demonſtrating that the parties were under no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of changing from time or accident, when they ſo liberally gave teſtimonies, which would always be ready, on failure, or infidelity, to be turned againſt them.—For my own part, it was the principal diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I had in her abſence: But for this innocent amuſement, the diſtance ſhe ſo frequently kept me at, would have been intolerable.</p>
                     <p>Sally knew my drift; and ſaid, She had had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſee two or three of my letters, and of Mr. Belford's; and ſhe thought them the moſt entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe had ever read.</p>
                     <p>My friend Belford, I ſaid, had a happy talent in the Letter-writing way; and upon all ſubjects.</p>
                     <p>I expected my Beloved would have been inquiſitive after our ſubjects: But (lying perdue, as I ſaw) not a word ſaid ſhe. So I touched upon this article myſelf.</p>
                     <p>Our topics were various and diffuſe: Sometimes upon literary articles [She was very attentive upon this]; ſometimes upon the public entertainments; ſometimes amuſing each other with the fruits of the different correſpondencies we held with perſons abroad, with whom we had contracted friendſhips; ſometimes upon the foibles and perfections of our particular friends; ſometimes upon our own preſent and future
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0041800508:119"/>
hopes; ſometimes aiming at humour and raillery upon each other—It might indeed appear to ſavour of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to ſuppoſe my Letters would entertain a Lady of her delicacy and judgment: But yet I could not but ſay, that perhaps ſhe would be far from thinking ſo hardly of me as ſometimes ſhe had ſeemed to do, if ſhe were to ſee the Letters which generally paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mr. Belford and me [I hope, Jack, thou haſt more manners, than to give me the lye, tho' but in thy heart].</p>
                     <p>She then ſpoke: After declining my compliment in ſuch a manner, as only a perſon could do, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it, ſhe ſaid, For her part, ſhe had always thought me a man of ſenſe [A man of ſenſe, Jack! What a niggardly praiſe!]—And ſhould therefore hope, that, when I wrote, it exceeded even my ſpeech: For that it was impoſſible, be the Letters written in as eaſy and familiar a ſtyle as they would, but that they muſt have that advantage from ſitting down to write them which prompt ſpeech could not always have. She ſhould think it very ſtrange, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if my Letters were barren of ſentiment; and <hi>as</hi> ſtrange, if I gave myſelf liberties upon <hi>premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> which could have no excuſe at all, but from a thoughtleſſneſs, which itſelf wanted excuſe.—But if Mr. Belford's Letters and mine were upon ſubjects ſo general, and ſome of them equally (ſhe preſumed) inſtructive and entertaining, ſhe could not but ſay, that ſhe ſhould be glad to ſee any of them; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thoſe which Miſs Martin had ſeen, and praiſed.</p>
                     <p>This was put cloſe.</p>
                     <p>I looked at her, to ſee if I could diſcover any tincture of jealouſy in this hint; that <hi>Miſs Martin</hi> had ſeen what I had not ſhewn to <hi>her.</hi> But ſhe did not look it: So I only ſaid, I ſhould be very proud to ſhew her not only thoſe, but all that paſſed between Mr. Belford and me; but I muſt remind her, that ſhe knew the condition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0041800508:120"/>No, indeed! with a ſweet lip pouted out, as ſaucy as pretty; implying a lovely ſcorn, that yet can only be lovely in youth ſo blooming, and beauty ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>How I long to ſee ſuch a motion again! <hi>Her</hi> mouth only can give it.</p>
                     <p>But I am mad with Love—Yet eternal will be the diſtance, at the rate I go on: Now fire, now ice, my ſoul is continually upon the <hi>hiſs,</hi> as I may ſay. In vain, however, is the trial to quench—what, after all, is unquenchable.</p>
                     <p>Pry'thee, Belford, forgive my nonſenſe, and my Vulcan-like metaphors—Did I not tell thee, not that I am <hi>ſick</hi> of Love, but that I am <hi>mad</hi> with it? Why brought I ſuch an angel into ſuch a houſe? into ſuch company? — And why do I not ſtop my ears to the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens, who, knowing my averſion to wedlock, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually touching that ſtring?</p>
                     <p>I was not willing to be anſwered ſo eaſily: I was ſure, that what paſſed between two ſuch young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies (friends ſo dear) might be ſeen by every-body: I had more reaſon than any-body to wiſh to ſee the Letters that paſſed between her and Miſs Howe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was ſure they muſt be full of admirable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and one of the dear correſpondents had deigned to wiſh my entire reformation.</p>
                     <p>She looked at me, as if ſhe would look me thro': I thought I <hi>felt</hi> eye-beam, after eye-beam, penetrate my ſhivering reins.—But ſhe was ſilent. Nor needed her eyes the aſſiſtance of ſpeech.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, a little recovering myſelf, I hoped that nothing unhappy had befallen either Miſs Howe or her Mother. The Letter of yeſterday ſent by a particular hand; ſhe opening it with great emotion— ſeeming to have expected it ſooner—were the reaſons for my apprehenſions.</p>
                     <p>We were then at Muſwell-hill: <hi>A pretty country within the eye,</hi> to Polly, was the remark, inſtead of replying to <hi>me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0041800508:121"/>But I was not ſo to be anſwered—I ſhould expect ſome charming ſubjects and characters from two ſuch pens: I hoped every-thing went on well between Mr. Hickman and Miſs Howe. Her Mother's heart, I ſaid, was ſet upon that match: Mr. Hickman was not without his merits: He was what they Ladies called a SOBER man: But I muſt needs ſay, that I thought Miſs Howe deſerved a huſband of a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent caſt!</p>
                     <p>This, I ſuppoſed, would have engaged her into a ſubject from which I could have wiredrawn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:—For Hickman is one of her favourites—Why, I can't divine, except for the ſake of oppoſition of character to that of thy honeſt friend.</p>
                     <p>But ſhe cut me ſhort by a look of diſapprobation, and another cool remark upon a diſtant view; and, <hi>How far off, Miſs Horton, do you think that clump of trees may be?</hi> pointing out of the coach—So I had done.</p>
                     <p>Here endeth all I have to write concerning our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation on this our agreeable airing.</p>

                     <p>'Tis true, I have owned more than once, that I could have liked Mr. Lovelace above all men. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the debates you and I uſed to have on this ſubject, when I was your happy gueſt. You uſed to ſay, and once you wrote, that men of his caſt are the men that our Sex do not <hi>naturally</hi> diſlike: While I held, that ſuch were not (however <hi>that</hi> might be) the men we <hi>ought</hi> to like. But what with my Relations precipitating of me, on one hand, and what with his unhappy character, and embarraſſing ways, on the other, I had no more leiſure than inclination to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine my own heart in this particular. And this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds me of a paſſage in one of your former Letters,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0041800508:122"/>
which I will tranſcribe, tho' it was written in raillery. <hi>May it not be,</hi> ſay you <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. i. p. 66. of both Editions.</note>, <hi>that you have had ſuch perſons to deal with, as have not allowed you to attend to the throbs; or, if you had them a little now-and-then, whether, having had two accounts to place them to, you have not by miſtake put them to the wrong one?</hi> A paſſage, which, altho' it came into my mind when Mr. Lovelace was leaſt exceptionable, yet that I have denied any efficacy to, when he has teazed and vexed me, and given me cauſe of ſuſpicion. For, after all, my dear, Mr. Lovelace is not wiſe in all his ways. And ſhould we not endeavour, as much as is poſſible, (where we are not attached by <hi>natural</hi> ties) to like and diſlike as reaſon bids us, and according to the merit or demerit of the object? If Love, as it is called, is allowed to be an excuſe for our moſt unreaſonable fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and to lay level all the fences that a careful edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation has ſurrounded us by, what is meant by the doctrine of ſubduing our paſſions?—But, O my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friend, am I not guilty of a puniſhable fault, were I to love this man of errors? And has not my own heart deceived me, when I thought I did not? And what muſt be that Love, that has not ſome degree of purity for its object? I am afraid of recollecting ſome paſſages in my Couſin Morden's Letter <note n="(b)" place="bottom">See Vol. iii. Edit. i. p. 356, &amp; ſeq. and Edit. ii. p. 370, &amp; ſeq.</note>.—And yet why fly I from ſubjects that, duly conſidered, might tend to correct and purify my heart? I have carried, I doubt, my notions on this head too high, not for practice, but for <hi>my</hi> practice. Yet think me not guilty of Prudery neither; for had I found out as much of myſelf before, or, rather, had he given me heart's-eaſe enough before to find it out, you ſhould have had my confeſſion ſooner.</p>

                     <p>But here, Jack, is the thing that concludes me, and caſes my heart with adamant: I find by Miſs Howe's Letters, that it is owing to <hi>her,</hi> that I have made no greater progreſs with my blooming Fair-one. She loves me. The Ipecacuanha contrivance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces me, that ſhe loves me. Where there is Love, there muſt be confidence, or a deſire of having <hi>reaſon</hi> to confide. Generoſity, founded on my ſuppoſed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, has taken hold of her heart. Shall I not now ſee (ſince I muſt be for ever unhappy, if I marry her, and leave any trial uneſſayed) what I can make of her Love, and her newly-raiſed confidence?—Will it not be to my glory to ſucceed? And to hers, and to the honour of her Sex, if I cannot?— Where then will be the hurt to either, to make the trial?

                     <p>So here am I in my Dining-room; and have nothing to do but write, till they return.</p>
                     <p>And what will be my ſubject, thinkeſt thou?— Why, the old beaten one, to be ſure; Self-debate—
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0041800508:126"/>
thro' temporary remorſe: For the blow being not ſtruck, her guardian angel is redoubling his efforts to ſave her.</p>
                     <p>If it be not <hi>that</hi> [And yet what power ſhould <hi>her</hi> guardian angel have over <hi>me?</hi>] I don't know what it is, that gives a check to my revenge, whenever I me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate treaſon againſt ſo ſovereign a virtue. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is dead and gone, as I told thee; ſo it cannot be that. A young Conſcience growing up, like the phoenix, from the aſhes of the old one, it cannot be ſurely. But if it were, it would be hard, if I could not overlay a young Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Well then, it muſt be LOVE, I fanſy. LOVE it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, inſpiring Love of an object ſo adorable—Some little attention poſſibly paid too to thy whining argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in her favour.</p>
                     <p>Let LOVE then be allowed to be the moving prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; and the rather, as LOVE naturally makes the Lover loth to diſoblige the object of its flame; and knowing, that an offence of the <hi>meditated</hi> kind will be a mortal offence to her, cannot bear that I ſhould think of giving it.</p>
                     <p>Let LOVE and me talk together a little on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject—Be it a <hi>Young Conſcience,</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> or <hi>Thyſelf,</hi> Jack, thou ſeeſt that I am for giving every whiffler audience. But <hi>this</hi> muſt be the laſt debate on this ſubject; for is not her fate in a manner at its criſis? And muſt not my next ſtep be an irretrievable one, tend it which way it will?</p>
                     <p>AND now the debate is over.</p>
                     <p>A thouſand charming things (for LOVE is gentler than CONSCIENCE) has this little urchin ſuggeſted in her favour.</p>
                     <p>He pretended to know both our hearts: And he would have it, that tho' my Love was a prodigious ſtrong and potent Love; and tho' it has the merit of many months faithful ſervice to plead, and has had
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0041800508:127"/>
infinite difficulties to ſtruggle with; yet that it is not THE RIGHT SORT OF LOVE.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Right ſort of Love!</hi>—A puppy!—But, with due regard to your deityſhip, ſaid I, what merit has ſhe with YOU, that <hi>you</hi> ſhould be of her party? Is <hi>hers,</hi> I pray you, a <hi>right ſort of Love?</hi> Is it <hi>Love</hi> at all? She don't <hi>pretend</hi> that it is. She owns not your ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty. What a d—l moves <hi>You,</hi> to plead thus ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for a rebel, who deſpiſes your power?</p>
                     <p>And then he came with his <hi>If</hi>'s and <hi>And</hi>'s—And it would <hi>have been,</hi> and <hi>ſtill,</hi> as he believed, would be, Love, and a Love of the exalted kind, if I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it by the <hi>right ſort of Love</hi> he talked of: And, in juſtification of his opinion, pleaded her own confeſſions, as well thoſe of yeſterday, as of this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And even went ſo far back as to my Ipecacuanha-illneſs.</p>
                     <p>I never talked ſo familiarly with his godſhip before: Thou mayeſt think therefore, that his dialect ſounded oddly in my ears. And then he told me, how often I had thrown cold water upon the moſt charming flame that ever warmed a Lady's boſom, while yet but young and riſing.</p>
                     <p>I required a definition of this <hi>right ſort</hi> of Love. He tried at it: But made a ſorry hand of it: Nor could I, for the ſoul of me, be convinced, that what he meant to extol, was LOVE.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, we had a notable controverſy upon this ſubject, in which he inſiſted upon the <hi>unprecedented merit</hi> of the Lady. Nevertheleſs I got the better of him; for he was ſtruck abſolutely dumb, when (wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her preſent perverſeneſs, which yet was a ſufficient anſwer to all his pleas) I aſſerted, and offered to prove it, by a thouſand inſtances <hi>impromptu,</hi> that Love was not governed by <hi>merit,</hi> nor could be under the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>prudence,</hi> or any other <hi>reaſoning power:</hi> And that if the Lady were capable of Love, it was of ſuch a ſort of Love, <hi>as he had nothing to do with,</hi> and which never before reigned in a female heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0041800508:128"/>I aſked him, What he thought of her flight from me, at a time when I was more than half overcome by the <hi>right ſort of Love</hi> he talked of?—And then I ſhewed him the Letter ſhe wrote, and left behind her for me, with an intention, no doubt, abſolutely to break my heart, or to provoke me to hang, drown, or ſhoot myſelf; to ſay nothing of a multitude of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations from her, defying his power, and imputing all that looked like Love in her behaviour to me, to the perſecution and rejection of her friends; which made her think of me but as a laſt reſort.</p>
                     <p>LOVE then gave her up. The Letter, he ſaid, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved neither pardon nor excuſe. He did not think he had been pleading for ſuch a <hi>declared</hi> rebel. And as to the reſt, he ſhould be a betrayer of the rights of his own ſovereignty, if what I had alleged were true, and he were ſtill to plead for her.</p>
                     <p>I ſwore to the truth of all. And <hi>truly</hi> I ſwore: Which perhaps I do not always do.</p>
                     <p>And now what thinkeſt thou muſt become of the Lady, whom LOVE itſelf gives up, and CONSCIENCE cannot plead for?</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0041800508:129"/>
theſe women are, to whom I intend ſo much diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. I think I have not heretofore mentioned any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing-characteriſtic of their perſons.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. <hi>Moore</hi> is a widow of about Thirty-eight; a little mortified by misfortunes; but thoſe are often the merrieſt folks, when warmed. She has good fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſtill; and is what they call much of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, and very neat in her perſon and dreſs. She has given over, I believe, all thoughts of our Sex: But when the dying embers are raked up about the half-conſumed ſtump, there will be fuel enough left, I dare ſay, to blaze out, and give a comfortable warmth to a half-ſtarved by ſtander.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. <hi>Bevis</hi> is comely; that is to ſay, plump; a lover of mirth, and one whom no grief ever dwelt with, I dare ſay, for a week together; about Twenty-five years of age: Mowbray will have very little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty with her, I believe; for one cannot do every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing one's ſelf. And yet ſometimes women of this free caſt, when it comes to the point, anſwer not the promiſes their chearful forwardneſs gives a man who has a view upon them.</p>
                     <p>Miſs <hi>Rawlins</hi> is an agreeable young Lady enough; but not beautiful. She has ſenſe, and would be thought <hi>to know the world,</hi> as it is called; but, for her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, is more indebted to <hi>Theory</hi> than <hi>Experience.</hi> A mere whipt-ſyllabub knowlege this, Jack, that always fails the perſon who truſts to it, when it ſhould hold to do her ſervice. For ſuch young Ladies have ſo much dependence upon their own underſtanding and warineſs, are ſo much above the cautions that the leſs opinionative may be benefited by, that their preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is generally their overthrow, when attempted by a man of experience, who knows how to flatter their vanity, and to magnify their wiſdom, in order to take advantage of their folly. But, for Miſs Rawlins, if I can add <hi>Experience</hi> to her <hi>Theory,</hi> what an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed perſon will ſhe be!—And how much will ſhe
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0041800508:130"/>
be obliged to me; and not only <hi>ſhe,</hi> but all thoſe who may be the better for the <hi>precepts</hi> ſhe thinks herſelf already ſo well qualified to give! Dearly, Jack, do I love to engage with theſe <hi>precept-givers,</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample-ſetters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, Belford, altho' there is nothing ſtriking in any of theſe characters; yet may we, at a pinch, make a good frolicky half-day with them, if, after we have ſoftened their wax at table by encouraging viands, we can ſet our women and them into dancing: Dancing, which all women love, and all men ſhould therefore promote, for <hi>both</hi> their ſakes.</p>
                     <p>And thus, when Tourville ſings, Belton fiddles, Mowbray makes rough love, and I ſmooth; and thou, Jack, wilt be by that time well enough to join in the chorus; the devil's in't, if we don't mould them into what ſhape we pleaſe—our own women, by their laughing freedoms, encouraging them to break thro' all their cuſtomary reſerves: For Women to Women, thou knoweſt, are great darers and incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; not one of them loving to be outdone or out-dared, when their hearts are thoroughly warmed.</p>
                     <p>I know, at firſt, the difficulty will be the <hi>accidental</hi> abſence of my dear Mrs. Lovelace, to whom princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally they will deſign their viſit: But if we can exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larate them, they won't then wiſh to ſee her; and I can form twenty accidents and excuſes, from one hour to another, for her abſence, till each ſhall have a ſubject to take up all her thoughts.</p>

                     <p>I was forced to take the Mother down; for ſhe began with her Hoh, Sirs! with me; and to cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize and upbraid me, with as much inſolence as if I owed her money.</p>
                     <p>I made her fly the Pit, at laſt. Strange wiſhes

                     <p>Sally and Polly gave themſelves high airs too. Their firſt favours were thrown at me. Women to boaſt of thoſe favours which they were as willing to impart, firſt forms all the difficulty with them! as I to receive, how whimſical! I was upbraided with Ingratitude, <hi>Daſtardice,</hi> and all my difficulties with my angel charged upon myſelf, for want of following my blows; and for leaving the proud Lady miſtreſs of her own will, and nothing to <hi>reproach herſelf with.</hi> And all agreed, that the arts uſed againſt her on a certain occaſion, had too high an operation for them or me to judge what her will <hi>would have been</hi> in the arduous trial. And then they blamed one another; as I curſed them all.</p>
                     <p>They concluded that I ſhould certainly marry, and be <hi>a loſt man.</hi> And Sally, on this occaſion, with an affected an malicious laugh, ſnapt her fingers at me, and pointing two of each hand forkedly at me, bid me remember the lines I once ſhewed her, of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite <hi>Jack</hi> Dryden, as ſhe always familiarly calls that celebrated Poet.</p>

                     <p>That's a charming girl! Her ſpirit, her delightful ſpirit!—Not to be married to it—How I wiſh to get that lively Bird into my cage! How would I make her flutter and fly about!—Till ſhe left a feather upon every wire!</p>
                     <p>Had I begun there, I am confident, as I have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſaid, that I ſhould not have had half the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty with her, as I have had with her charming friend. For theſe paſſionate girls have high pulſes, and a cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fellow may make what ſport he pleaſes with their <hi>unevenneſſes</hi>—Now too high, now too low, you need only to provoke and appeaſe them by turns; to bear with them, and forbear; to teaze, and aſk pardon; and ſometimes to give yourſelf the merit of a ſufferer from them; then catching them in the moment of conceſſion, conſcious of their ill uſage of you, they are all your own.</p>
                     <p>But theſe ſedate, contemplative girls, never out of temper but with reaſon; when that reaſon is given them, hardly ever pardon, or afford you another op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to offend.</p>
                     <p>It was in part the apprehenſion that this would be ſo with my dear Miſs Harlowe, that made me carry her to a place where I believed ſhe would be unable to eſcape me, altho' I were <hi>not</hi> to ſucceed in my firſt attempts. Elſe widow Sorlings's would have been as
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0041800508:135"/>
well for me, as widow Sinclair's. For early I ſaw, that there was no credulity in her to graft upon: No pretending to whine myſelf into her confidence. She was proof againſt amorous perſuaſion. She had <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in her Love. Her penetration and good ſenſe made her hate all compliments that had not truth and nature in them. What could I have done with her in any other place? And yet how long, even <hi>there,</hi> was I kept in awe, in ſpite of <hi>natural incitement,</hi> and <hi>unnatural inſtigations</hi> (as I now think them) by the mere force of that native dignity, and obvious purity of mind and manners, which fill every one with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, if not with <hi>holy love,</hi> as thou calleſt it, the moment he ſees her!—Elſe, thinkeſt thou not, it was eaſy for me to be a <hi>fine gentleman,</hi> and a <hi>delicate</hi> Lover, or, at leaſt, a <hi>ſpecious</hi> and <hi>flattering</hi> one?</p>
                     <p>Lady Sarah and Lady Betty, finding the treaty, upon the ſucceſs of which they have ſet their fooliſh hearts, likely to run into length, are about departing to their own Seats; having taken from me the beſt ſecurity the nature of the caſe will admit of, that is to ſay, <hi>my word,</hi> to marry the Lady, if ſhe will have me.</p>
                     <p>And after all (methinks thou aſkeſt) Art thou ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to repair, if reparation be put into thy power?</p>
                     <p>Why, Jack, I muſt needs own, that my heart has now-and-then ſome retrograde motions, upon thinking ſeriouſly of the irrevocable ceremony. We do not eaſily give up the deſire of our hearts, and what we imagine eſſential to our happineſs, let the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or hope of compaſſing it be ever ſo unreaſonable or abſurd in the opinion of others. <hi>Recurrings</hi> there will be: hankerings that will, on every but remotely-favourable incident (however before diſcouraged and beaten back by ill ſucceſs) pop up, and abate the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction we ſhould otherwiſe take in <hi>contrariant</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p>'Tis ungentlemanly, Jack, <hi>man to man,</hi> to lye—
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0041800508:136"/>
But Matrimony I do not <hi>heartily</hi> love—altho' with a CLARISSA—Yet I am in earneſt to marry her.</p>
                     <p>But I am often thinking, that if now this dear creature, ſuffering time, and my penitence, my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations prayers, and Miſs Howe's meditation, to ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten her <hi>reſentments</hi> [Her <hi>revenge</hi> thou haſt prettily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed away] and to recall repulſed inclination, ſhould conſent to meet me at the altar—How vain will ſhe then make all thy eloquent periods of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration!—How many charming interjections of her own will ſhe ſpoil! And what a couple of old Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs ſhall we become, going on in the mill-horſe round; getting ſons and daughters; providing Nurſes for them firſt, Governors and Governeſſes next; teaching them leſſons their Father never prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, nor which their Mother, as her Parents will ſay, was much the better for! And at laſt perhaps, when life ſhall be turned into the dully-ſober Stilneſs, and I become deſirous to forget all my paſt Rogueries, what comfortable reflections will it afford, to find them all revived, with <hi>equal,</hi> or probably <hi>greater</hi> trouble and expence, in the perſons and manners of ſo many young Lovelaces of the Boys; and to have the Girls run away with varlets perhaps not half ſo ingenious as myſelf; clumſy fellows, as it might happen, who could not afford the baggages one excuſe for their weakneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe diſgraceful ones of <hi>Sex</hi> and <hi>Nature!</hi>—O Belford! who can bear to think of theſe things!— Who, at my time of life eſpecially, and with ſuch a byas for miſchief!</p>
                     <p>Of this I am abſolutely convinced, that if a man ever intends to marry, and to enjoy in peace his own reflections; and not be afraid of retribution, or of the conſequences of his own example; he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a Rake.</p>
                     <p>This looks like Conſcience; don't it, Belford?</p>

                     <p>Every one knows, tbat the Mother (ſawcy as the Daughter ſometimes is) crams him down her throat. Her Mother is one of the moſt violent-ſpirited wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>England.</hi> Her late Huſband could not ſtand in the matrimonial contention of <hi>Who ſhould?</hi> but tipt off the perch in it, neither knowing how to yield, nor how to conquer.</p>
                     <p>A charming encouragement for a man of intrigue, whee he has reaſon to believe, that the woman he has a view upon has no Love for her Huſband! What good Principles muſt that Wife have, who is kept in againſt temptation by a ſenſe of her duty, and plighted faith, where affection has no hold of her!</p>
                     <p>Pr'ythee let's know, very particularly, how it fares with poor Belton—'Tis an honeſt fellow—Something more than his Thomaſine ſeems to ſtick with him.</p>
                     <p>Thou haſt not been preaching to him Conſcience and Reformation; haſt thou?—Thou ſhouldſt not take liberries with him of this ſort, unleſs thou thoughteſt him abſolutely irrecoverable. A man in ill health, and cropſick, cannot play with theſe ſolemn things, as thou canſt, and be neither better nor worſe for them.—Repentance, Jack, I have a notion, ſhould be ſet about while a man is in health and ſpirits. What's a man fit for [Not to begin a new work ſurely] when he is not himſelf, nor maſter of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties?—Hence, as I apprehend, it is that a death-bed repentance is ſuppoſed to be ſuch a precarious and ineffectual thing.</p>
                     <p>As to myſelf, I hope I have a great deal of time before me; ſince I intend <hi>one day</hi> to be a Reformed man. I have very ſerious reflections now-and-then. Yet am I half-afraid of the truth of what my Charmer once told me, that <hi>a man cannot repent when he will.</hi> — Not to hold it, I ſuppoſe ſhe meant! By fits and ſtarts I have repented a thouſand times.</p>

                     <p>To what, Lovelace, ſhall we attribute the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which a <hi>reputed</hi> Father frequently ſhews to the children of another man?—What is that, I pray thee, which we call <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Natural Affection?</hi> And what has man to boaſt of as to ſagacity and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he is as eaſily brought to cover and rear, and even to love, and often to prefer, the product of another's guilt with his Wife or Miſtreſs, as a hen or a gooſe the eggs, and even <hi>young,</hi> of others of their kind?</p>
                     <p>Nay, let me aſk, If <hi>inſtinct,</hi> as it is called, in the animal creation, does not enable them to diſtinguiſh their own, much more eaſily than we, with our boaſted <hi>reaſon</hi> and ſagacity, in this nice particular, can do?</p>
                     <p>If ſome men, who have Wives but of doubtful vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, conſidered this matter duly, I believe their inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate ardor after gain would be a good deal cooled, when they could not be certain (tho' their <hi>Mates</hi> could) for whoſe children they were elbowing, buſtling, gripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and perhaps cheating, thoſe with whom they have concerns, whether friends, neighbours, or <hi>more</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain next-of-kin, by the Mother's ſide however.</p>
                     <p>But I will not puſh this notion ſo far as it might be carried; becauſe, if propagated, it might be of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſocial</hi> or <hi>unnatural</hi> conſequence; ſince women of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue would perhaps be more liable to ſuffer by the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſts and caprices of <hi>bad-hearted</hi> and <hi>fooliſh-headed</hi> Huſbands, than thoſe who can ſcreen themſelves from detection by arts and hypocriſy, to which a woman of

virtue cannot have recourſe. And yet, were this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion duly and generally conſidered, it might be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with no bad effects; as good education, good inclinations, and eſtabliſhed virtue, would be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally ſought-after qualities, and not money, when a man (not byaſſed by mere perſonal attractions) was looking round him for a partner in his fortunes, and for a mother of his future children, which are to be the heirs of his poſſeſſions, and to enjoy the fruits of his induſtry.</p>

her, as thou ſayeſt he did, to his ſtupid heart; at that time, no doubt, more ſenſible, than ever it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore!</p>
                     <p>By thy deſcription of their parting, I ſee thou wilt be a delicate fellow in time. My Mortification in this Lady's diſpleaſure, will be thy exaltation from her converſation. I envy thee as well for thy opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as for thy improvements: And ſuch an impreſſion has thy concluding paragraph made upon me, that I wiſh I do not get into a Reformation-humour as well as thou: And then what a couple of lamentable pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies ſhall we make, howling in recitative to each other's diſcordant muſic!</p>
                     <p>Let me improve upon the thought, and imagine that, turned Hermits, we have opened the two old Caves at Hornſey, or dug new ones; and in each of our cells ſet up a death's head, and an hour-glaſs, for objects of contemplation—I have ſeen ſuch a picture: But then, Jack, had not the old penitent fornicator a ſuffocating long grey beard? What figures would a couple of brocaded or laced-waiſtcoated toupets make with their ſour ſcrew'd up half-cock'd faces, and more than half-ſhut eyes, in a kneeling attitude, recapitulating their reſpective rogueries? This ſcheme, were we only to make trial of it, and return after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to our old ways, might ſerve to better purpoſe by far, than Horner's in the Country Wife, to bring the pretty wenches to us.</p>
                     <p>Let me ſee; The Author of Hudibras has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where a deſcription that would ſuit us, when met in one of our Caves, and comparing our diſmal notes together. This is it. Suppoſe <hi>me</hi> deſcribed —

It is truly, to be ingenuous, a forced put: For my paſſions are ſo wound up, that I am obliged either to laugh or cry. Like honeſt drunken Jack Daventry [Poor fellow!—What an unhappy end was his!]—Thou knoweſt, I uſed to obſerve, that whenever he roſe from an entertainment, which he never did ſober, it was his way, as ſoon as he got to the door, to look round him, like a carrier-pigeon juſt thrown up, in order to ſpy out his courſe; and then, taking to his heels, he would run all the way home, tho' it were a mile or two, when he could hardly ſtand, and muſt have tumbled on his noſe if he had attempted to walk moderately.

                     <p>Charlotte, in a whim of delicacy, is diſpleaſed that I ſend the incloſed Letter to you—That her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, forſooth! ſhould go into the hands of a ſingle man!</p>
                     <p>There's encouragement for thee, Belford! This is a certain ſign that thou mayſt have her if thou wilt. And yet, till ſhe had given me this unerring demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of her glancing towards thee, I could not have thought it. Indeed I have often in pleaſantry told her, that I would bring ſuch an affair to a bear. But I never intended it; becauſe ſhe really is dainty girl. And thou art ſuch a clumſy fellow in thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that I ſhould have as ſoon have wiſhed her a Rhinoceros for an huſband, as thee. But, poor little dears! they muſt ſtay till their time's come! They won't have this man, and they won't have that man, from Seventeen to Twenty-five: But then, afraid, as the ſaying is, that <hi>God has forgot them,</hi> and finding their bloom departing, they are glad of whom they can get, and verify the fable of the Parſon and the Pears.</p>

                     <p>But I know thee too well to depend upon any-thing thou ſayeſt on this ſubject.

                           <p>I will, IN THE FIRST PLACE, put her in mind of the <hi>common courſe of things</hi> in this <hi>ſublunary world,</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>SECONDLY, I will remind her of her own notable deſcription of <hi>Sorrow,</hi> when ſhe was once called upon to diſtinguiſh wherein <hi>Sorrow, Grief,</hi> and <hi>Melancholy,</hi> differed from each other; which ſhe did <hi>impromptu,</hi> by their <hi>effects,</hi> in a truly admirable manner, to the high ſatisfaction of every one: I myſelf could not, by <hi>ſtudy,</hi> have diſtinguiſhed <hi>better,</hi> nor more <hi>conciſely</hi>—SORROW, ſaid ſhe, <hi>wears</hi>; GRIEF <hi>tears</hi>; but MELANCHOLY <hi>ſooths.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>My inference to her ſhall be, that ſince a happy Reconciliation will take place, <hi>Grief</hi> will be baniſhed; <hi>Sorrow</hi> diſmiſſed; and only ſweet <hi>Melancholy</hi> remain to <hi>ſooth</hi> and <hi>indulge</hi> her <hi>contrite heart,</hi> and ſhew to all the world the penitent ſenſe ſhe hath of her great error.</p>
                           <p>THIRDLY, That her <hi>Joys</hi>

                           <p>FOURTHLY, That having <hi>really</hi> been guilty of a <hi>great error,</hi> ſhe ſhould not take <hi>impatiently</hi> the <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> and <hi>anger</hi> with which ſhe hath been treated.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>SEVENTHLY, That ſhe is really now in <hi>a way</hi> to be <hi>happy,</hi> ſince, according to <hi>Ovid,</hi> ſhe <hi>can count up all her woe:</hi>

                     <p>Miſs Howe is <hi>open, generous, noble.</hi> The Mother has not any of her fine qualities.

                        <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0041800508:169"/>Mr. Hickman has, however, this conſideration to comfort himſelf with; that the ſame vivacity by which <hi>he</hi> ſuffers, makes Miſs Howe's own <hi>Mother,</hi> at times, <hi>equally ſenſible.</hi> And as he ſees enough of this before-hand, he will have more reaſon to blame himſelf than the Lady, ſhould ſhe prove as lively a Wife, as ſhe was a Miſtreſs, for having continued his addreſſes, and married her, againſt ſuch threatening appearances.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo another circumſtance which good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured men who engage with even lively women, may look forward to with pleaſure; a circumſtance which generally lowers the ſpirits of the Ladies, and <hi>dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticates</hi> them, as I may call it: And which, as it will bring thoſe of Mr. Hickman and Miſs Howe nearer to a par, that worthy gentleman will have <hi>double</hi> reaſon, when it happens to congratulate himſelf upon it.</p>

                     <p>She was rather tall, than of a midling ſtature; and had a dignity in her aſpect and air, that beſpoke the mind that animated every feature.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>native</hi> dignity, as I may call it, induced ſome ſuperficial perſons, who knew not how to account for the reverence which involuntarily filled their hearts on her appearance, to impute pride to her. But theſe were ſuch as knew that they ſhould have been proud of any <hi>one</hi> of her perfections: Judging therefore by their own narrowneſs, they thought it impoſſible that the Lady who poſſeſſed <hi>ſo many,</hi> ſhould not think her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuperior to them all.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, I have heard her noble aſpect found fault with, as indicating pride and ſuperiority: But people

awed and controuled, tho' but by their own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of inferiority, will find fault, right or wrong, with thoſe of whoſe rectitude of mind and manners, their own culpable hearts give them to be afraid.

                     <p>Her Grandfather, in honour of her dexterity, and of her ſkill in all the parts of the dairy-management, as well as of the elegance of the offices allotted for that uſe, would have his Seat, before known by the name of <hi>The Grove,</hi> to be called, <hi>The Dairy-houſe.</hi> She had an eaſy, convenient, and graceful habit made on purpoſe, which ſhe put on when ſhe employed herſelf in theſe works; and it was noted of her, that in <hi>the ſame hour</hi> that ſhe appeared to be a moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Dairy-maid, ſhe was, when called to a change of dreſs, the fineſt Lady that ever graced a circle.</p>
                     <p>Her Grandfather, Father, Mother, Uncles, Aunt, and even her Brother and Siſter, made her frequent viſits there, and were delighted with her ſilent eaſe, and unaffected behaviour in her works; for ſhe always out of modeſty choſe rather the <hi>operative</hi> than the <hi>directive</hi> part, that ſhe might not diſcourage the ſervant whoſe proper buſineſs it was.</p>
                     <p>Each was fond of taking a regale from her hands in her <hi>Dairy-houſe.</hi> Her Mother and Aunt Hervey generally admired her in ſilence, that they might not give uneaſineſs to her Siſter; a ſpiteful, perverſe, unimitating thing, who uſually looked upon her all the time with ſpeechleſs envy. Now-and-then, however, the pouting creature would ſuffer extorted and ſparing praiſe to burſt open her lips; though looking at the ſame time like Saul meditating the pointed javelin at the heart of David, the glory of his kingdom. And now, methinks, I ſee my Angel-friend (too ſuperior to take notice of her gloom) courting her acceptance of the milk-white curd from hands more pure than that.</p>
                     <p>Her ſkill and dexterity in every branch of family management, ſeem to be the only excellence of her innumerable ones, which ſhe owed to her family: Whoſe narrowneſs, immenſely rich, and immenſely

carking, put them upon indulging her in the turn ſhe took to this part of knowlege; while her elder Siſter affected dreſs without being graceful in it; and the Fine Lady, which ſhe could never be; and which her Siſter was without ſtudying for it, or ſeeming to know ſhe was ſo.</p>
                     <p>It was uſual with the one Siſter, when company was expected, to be half the morning dreſſing; while the other would give directions for the whole buſineſs and entertainment of the day; and then go up to her dreſſing-room, and, before ſhe could well be miſſed, [<hi>having all her things in admirable order</hi>] come down fit to receive company, and with all that graceful eaſe and tranquillity as if ſhe had had nothing elſe to think of.</p>
                     <p>Long after <hi>her</hi> [hours perhaps of previous prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration having paſſed] down would come ruſtling and buſtling the tawdry and aukward Bella, diſordering more her native diſorderlineſs at the ſight of her ſerene Siſter, by her ſullen envy, to ſee herſelf ſo much ſurpaſſed with ſuch little pains, and in a ſixth part of the time.</p>
                     <p>Yet was this admirable creature miſtreſs of all theſe domeſtic qualifications without the leaſt intermixture of narrowneſs. She knew how to diſtinguiſh between <hi>Frugality,</hi> a neceſſary virtue, and <hi>Niggardlineſs,</hi> an odious vice: And uſed to ſay,

                     </p>
                     <p>She was the moſt graceful <hi>Reader</hi> I ever knew. She added by her melodious voice graces to thoſe ſhe found in the parts of books ſhe re'd-out to her friends; and gave grace and ſignificance to others where they were not. She had no tone, no whine. Her accent was always admirably placed. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis ſhe always forcibly laid, as the ſubject required. No buſkin-elevation, no tragedy-pomp, could miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead her; and yet poetry was poetry <hi>indeed,</hi> when ſhe re'd it.</p>

                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0041800508:177"/>But if her voice was melodious when ſhe <hi>re'd,</hi> it was all harmony when ſhe <hi>ſung.</hi> And the delight ſhe gave by that, and by her ſkill and great compaſs, was heightened by the eaſe and gracefulneſs of her air and manner, and by the alacrity with which ſhe obliged.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs ſhe generally choſe rather to hear others ſing or play, than either to play or ſing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>She delighted to give praiſe where deſerved: Yet ſhe always beſtowed it in ſuch a manner, as gave not the leaſt ſuſpicion that ſhe laid out for a return of it to herſelf, tho' ſo univerſally allowed to be her due.</p>
                     <p>She had a talent of ſaying uncommon things in ſuch an eaſy manner, that every-body thought they could have ſaid the ſame; and which yet required both genius and obſervation to ſay them.</p>
                     <p>Even ſevere things appeared gentle, tho' they loſt not their force, from the ſweetneſs of her air and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, and the apparent benevolence of her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>For her years, and her opportunities, ſhe was an extraordinary judge of Painting. In this, as in every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, <hi>Nature</hi> was her <hi>Art,</hi> her <hi>Art</hi> was <hi>Nature.</hi> She even prettily performed in it. Her Grandfather, for this reaſon, bequeathed to her all the family pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Charming was her fancy: Alike ſweet and eaſy was every touch of her pencil and her pen. Yet her judgment exceeded her performance. She did not practiſe enough to excel in the executive part. She could not in every-thing excel. But, upon the whole, ſhe knew what every ſubject required, according to the nature of it: In other words, was an abſolute Miſtreſs of the <hi>ſhould-be.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To give a familiar inſtance, for the ſake of young Ladies; ſhe (untaught) obſerved <hi>when but a child,</hi> that the Sun, Moon, and Stars, never appeared at once; and were therefore never to be in one piece: That bears, tygers, lions, were not natives of an Engliſh climate, and ſhould not therefore have place in an Engliſh landſchape: That theſe ravagers of the foreſt conſorted not with lambs, kids, or fawns: Nor kites, hawks, and vulturs, with doves, partridges, and pheaſants.</p>
                     <p>And, alas! ſhe knew, before ſhe was nineteen years of age, by fatal experience ſhe knew! that all theſe beaſts and birds of prey were outdone in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous cruelty by MAN! Vile, barbarous, plotting, deſtructive MAN! who, infinitely leſs excuſeable than thoſe, deſtroys thro' wantonneſs and ſport, what thoſe only deſtroy thro' hunger and neceſſity!</p>
                     <p>The mere pretenders to thoſe branches of Science which ſhe aimed at acquiring, ſhe knew how to detect;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0041800508:180"/>
and all from <hi>Nature. Propriety,</hi> another word for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was (as I have hinted) her Law, as it is the foundation of all true judgment.

                     <p>Let the <hi>modern</hi> Ladies, who have not any one of her excellent qualities; whoſe whole time, in the ſhort days they generally make, and in the inverted night and day, where they make them longer, is wholly ſpent in dreſs, viſits, cards, plays, operas, and muſical entertainments; wonder at what I have written, and ſhall further write: And let them look upon it as an incredible thing, that when, at a maturer age, they cannot boaſt one of her perfections, there ſhould have been a Lady ſo young, who had ſo many.</p>

Play. She never therefore promoted their being called for; and often inſenſibly diverted the Company from them, by ſtarting ſome entertaining ſubject, when ſhe could do it without incurring the imputation of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity.</p>
                     <p>Indeed very few of her intimates would propoſe Cards, if they could engage her to read, to talk, to touch the keys, or to ſing, when any new book, or new piece of muſic, came down. But when company was ſo numerous, that converſation could not take that agreeable turn which it ofteneſt does among four or five friends of like years and inclinations, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in a manner neceſſary to detach off ſome of it, to make the reſt better company, ſhe would not refuſe to play, if, upon caſting-in, it fell to her lot.

                     <p>In all her Readings, and in her Converſations upon them, ſhe was fonder of finding beauties than blemiſhes, and choſe to applaud both Authors and Books, where ſhe could find the leaſt room for it. Yet ſhe uſed to lament, that certain writers of the firſt claſs, who were capable of exalting virtue, and of putting vice out of countenance, too generally employed themſelves in works of <hi>imagination only,</hi> upon ſubjects <hi>merely ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, diſintereſting,</hi> and <hi>unedifying</hi>; from which no uſeful moral or example could be drawn.</p>

She often pitied the celebrated Dr. Swift for ſo employing his admirable pen, that a pure eye was afraid of looking into his works, and a pure ear of hearing any-thing quoted from them.

that they who were ſo capable of <hi>mending the heart,</hi> ſhould in any places ſhew a <hi>corrupt one</hi> in themſelves; which muſt weaken the influences of their good works, and pull down with one hand what they built up with the other.</p>
                     <p>All ſhe ſaid, and all ſhe did, was accompanied with a natural eaſe and dignity, which ſet her above affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, or the ſuſpicion of it; inſomuch that that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading fault, ſo generally imputed to a learned woman, was never laid to her charge. For, with all her excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, ſhe was forwarder to <hi>hear</hi> than <hi>ſpeak</hi>; and hence no doubt derived no ſmall part of her improvement.</p>
                     <p>Altho' ſhe was well read in the Engliſh, French, and Italian Poets, and had read the beſt tranſlations of the Latin Claſſics; yet ſeldom did ſhe quote or repeat from them, either in her Letters or Converſation, tho' exceedingly happy in a tenacious memory; principally thro' modeſty, and to avoid the imputation of that <hi>affectation</hi> which I have juſt mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Wyerley once ſaid of her, ſhe had ſuch a fund of knowlege of her own, and made naturally ſuch fine obſervations upon perſons and things, being capable <hi>by the Egg</hi> [that was his familiar expreſſion] <hi>of judging of the</hi> BIRD, that ſhe had ſeldom either room or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for foreign aſſiſtances.</p>
                     <p>But it was plain from her whole conduct and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that ſhe had not ſo good an opinion of herſelf, however deſerved; ſince, whenever ſhe was urged to give her ſentiments on any ſubject, altho' all ſhe thought fit to ſay was clear and intelligible; yet ſhe ſeemed in haſte to have done ſpeaking. Her reaſon for it, I know, was two-fold; That ſhe might not loſe the benefit of other peoples ſentiments, by engroſſing the converſation; and leſt, as were her words, ſhe ſhould be praiſed into <hi>loquaciouſneſs,</hi> and ſo forfeit the good opinion which a perſon always maintains with her friends, who knows when ſhe has ſaid enough.— It was, finally, a rule with her,

                     <p>The unhappy Parents and Uncles, from the peruſal of theſe Extracts, too evidently for their peace, ſaw, That it was entirely owing to the avarice, the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the envy of her implacable Brother and Siſter, and to the ſenſeleſs confederacy entered into by the whole family, to compel her to give her hand to a man ſhe muſt deſpiſe, or ſhe had not been a CLARISSA, and to their conſequent perſecutions of her, that ſhe ever thought of quitting her Father's houſe: And that even when ſhe firſt entertained ſuch a thought, it was with intent, if poſſible, to procure for herſelf a private aſylum with Mrs. Howe, or at ſome other place of ſafety (but not with Mr. Lovelace, nor with any of the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0041800508:188"/>
Ladies of his family, tho' invited by the latter) from whence ſhe might propoſe terms which ought to have been complied with, and which were entirely conſiſtent with her duty—That tho' ſhe found herſelf diſappointed of the hoped-for refuge and protection, ſhe intended not by meeting Mr. Lovelace, to put herſelf into his power; all that ſhe aimed at by taking that ſtep, being to endeavour to pacify ſo fierce a ſpirit, leſt he ſhould (as he indeed was determined to do) pay a viſit to her friends which might have been attended with fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences; but was ſpirited away by him in ſuch a manner, as made her an object of pity, rather than of blame.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Extracts further convinced them all, that it was to her unaffected regret, that ſhe found, that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was not in her power afterwards for a long time; and at laſt, but on one occaſion, when their unnatural cruelty to her (on a new application ſhe had made to her Aunt Hervey, to procure mercy and pardon) ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her incapable of receiving his proffer'd hand; and ſo obliged her to ſuſpend the day; intending only to ſuſpend it, till recovered.</p>
                     <p>They ſaw, with equal abhorrence of Lovelace, and of their own cruelty, and with the higheſt admiration of her, That the majeſty of her virtue had awed the moſt daring ſpirit in the world, ſo that he durſt not attempt to carry his baſe deſigns into execution, till, by wicked potions, he had made her ſenſes the previous ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>But how did they in a manner adore her memory!

                     <p>SALLY MARTIN was the Daughter of a ſubſtantial Mercer at the Court end of the town; to whom her Mother, a Grocer's Daughter in the city, brought a handſome fortune; and both having a gay turn, and being fond of the faſhions which it was their buſineſs to promote; and which the wives and daughters of the uppermoſt tradeſmen (eſpecially in that quarter of the town) generally affect to follow; it was no wonder that they brought up their Daughter accordingly: Nor that ſhe, who was a very ſprightly and ready-witted girl, and reckoned very pretty and very genteel, ſhould every year improve upon ſuch examples.</p>
                     <p>She early found herſelf miſtreſs of herſelf. All ſhe did was right: All ſhe ſaid was admired. Early, very early, did ſhe diſmiſs bluſhes from her cheek.

Not duly reflecting, that the part they ſuffered her to take in what made for their intereſt, would probably be a means to quicken the appetites and ruin the morals of that Daughter, for whoſe ſake, as an only child, they were ſolicitous to obtain wealth.</p>

At all public diverſions, ſhe was the leader, inſtead of the led, of all her fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male kindred and acquaintance; tho' they were a third older than herſelf. She would buſtle herſelf into a place, and make room for her more baſhful companions, through the frowns of the firſt poſſeſſors, at a crouded theatre; leaving every one near her amazed at her ſelf-conſequence, wondering ſhe had no ſervant to keep place for her; whiſperingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring who ſhe was; and then ſitting down ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring her fortitude.</p>

                     <p>She ſat in judgment, and an inexorable judge ſhe was, upon the actions and conduct of every man and woman of quality and faſhion, as they became the ſubjects of converſation. She was deeply learned in the ſcandalous Chronicle: She made every character, every praiſe, and every cenſure, ſerve to exalt herſelf. <hi>She ſhould ſcorn to do ſo or ſo!</hi>—Or, <hi>That was ever her way</hi>; and <hi>juſt what ſhe did, or liked to do</hi>; and judging herſelf by the vileneſs of the moſt vile of her Sex, ſhe wiped her mouth, and ſat down ſatisfied witli her own virtue.</p>
                     <p>She had her Chair to attend her where-ever ſhe went, and found people among her <hi>Betters,</hi> as her pride ſtooped to call ſome of the moſt inſignificant people in the world, to encourage her viſits.</p>
                     <p>She was practiſed in all the arts of the Card-table: A true Spartan girl; and had even courage, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to wrangle off a detection. Late hours (turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night into day, and day into night) were the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unavoidable conſequence of her frequent play. Her parents pleaſed themſelves that their Sally had a charming conſtitution: And as long as ſhe ſuffered not in her health, they were regardleſs of her morals.</p>
                     <p>The Needle ſhe hated: And made the conſtant ſubjects of her ridicule the fine works that uſed to employ, and to keep out of idleneſs, luxury, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance, and at <hi>home</hi> (were they to have been of no other ſervice) the women of the laſt age, when there were no Vaux-halls, Ranelaghs, Marybones, and ſuch-like places of diverſion, to dreſs out for, and gad after.</p>
                     <p>And as to Family-management, her parents had not required any knowlege of that ſort from her; and ſhe conſidered it as a qualification only neceſſary
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0041800508:193"/>
for hirelings, and the low-born, and as utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the attention of a modern fine Lady.</p>
                     <p>Altho' her Father had great buſineſs, yet, living in ſo high and expenſive a way, he pretended not to give her a fortune anſwerable to it. Neither he nor his Wife, having ſet out with any notion of frugality, could think of retrenching. Nor did their Daughter deſire that they ſhould retrench. They thought glare or oſtentation reputable. They called it living <hi>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teelly.</hi> And as they lifted their heads above their neighbours, they ſuppoſed their credit concerned to go forward rather than backward in outward appearances. They flattered themſelves, and they flattered their girl, and ſhe was <hi>entirely</hi> of their opinion, that ſhe had charms and wit enough to attract ſome man of rank; of <hi>Fortune</hi> at leaſt: And yet this Daughter of a Mercer-Father and Grocer-Mother could not bear the thoughts of a creeping Cit; encouraging herſelf with the few inſtances (<hi>comparatively</hi> few) which ſhe had always in her head as <hi>common ones,</hi> of girls much inferior to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſtation, talents, education, and even fortune, who had ſucceeded—as ſhe doubted not to ſucceed. Handſome Settlements, and a Chariot, that tempting gewgaw to the vanity of the middling claſs of females, were the leaſt that ſhe propoſed to herſelf. But all this while, neither her parents nor herſelf conſidered, that ſhe had appetites indulged to ſtruggle with, and a turn of education given her, as well as a warm conſtitution, unguarded by ſound principles, and unbenefited by example, which made her much better qualified for a Miſtreſs than a Wife.</p>
                     <p>Her Twentieth year, to her own equal wonder and regret, paſſed over her head, and ſhe had not had one offer that her pride would permit her to accept of. A girl from Fifteen to Eighteen, her beauty then begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to bloſſom, will, as a new thing, attract the eyes of men: But if ſhe make her face cheap at public places, ſhe will find, that <hi>new</hi> faces will draw more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0041800508:194"/>
than <hi>fine</hi> faces conſtantly ſeen. Policy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if nothing elſe were conſidered, would induce a young Beauty, if ſhe could tame her vanity, juſt to ſhew herſelf, and to be talked of, and then withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as if from diſcretion (and diſcreet it will be to do ſo) expect to be <hi>ſought after,</hi> rather than to be thought to <hi>ſeek for</hi>; only reviving now-and-then the memory of herſelf, at the public places in turn, if ſhe find her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf likely to be forgotten; and then ſhe will be new again. But this obſervation ought young Ladies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to have in their heads, that they can hardly ever expect to gratify their vanity, and at the ſame time gain the admiration of men worthy of making partners for life. They may, in ſhort, have many admirers at public places, but not one Lover.</p>
                     <p>Sally Martin knew nothing of this doctrine. Her beauty was in its bloom, and yet ſhe found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf neglected.

                     <p>At laſt, her deſtiny approached. It was at a Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade, that ſhe firſt ſaw the gay, the handſome Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, who was juſt returned from his travels. She was immediately ſtruck with his figure, and with the bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant things that ſhe heard fall from his lips as he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to ſit near her. He, who was not then looking out for a Wife, was taken with Sally's ſmartneſs, and with an air that at the ſame time ſhewed her to be equally genteel and ſelf-ſignificant; and ſigns of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation mutually paſſing, he found no difficulty in acquainting himſelf where to viſit her next day. And yet it was ſome mortification to a perſon of her ſelf-conſequence, and gay appearance, to ſubmit to be known by ſo fine a young gentleman as no more than a Mercer's daughter. So natural is it for a girl brought up as Sally was, to be occaſionally aſhamed of thoſe whoſe folly had ſet her above herſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0041800508:195"/>But whatever it might be to Sally, it was no diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to Mr. Lovelace, to find his Miſtreſs of no higher degree; becauſe he hoped to reduce her ſoon to the loweſt condition that an unhappy woman can fall into.</p>
                     <p>But when Miſs Martin had informed herſelf, that her Lover was the Nephew and preſumptive Heir of Lord M. ſhe thought him the very man for whom ſhe had been ſo long and ſo impatiently looking out; and for whom it was worth her while to ſpread her toils. And here it may not be amiſs to obſerve, that it is very probable, that Mr. Lovelace had Sally Martin in his thoughts, and perhaps two or three more whoſe hopes of marriage from him had led them to their ruin, when he drew the following whimſical picture, in a Letter to his friend Belford, not inſerted in the preceding Collection.</p>

                     <p>In ſhort, Sally's parents, as well as herſelf, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Mr. Lovelace's viſits. They thought they might truſt to a diſcretion in her which ſhe herſelf was too wiſe to doubt. Pride they knew ſhe had. And that, in theſe caſes, is often called diſcretion —Lord help the Sex, ſays Lovelace, if they had not Pride!—Nor did they ſuſpect danger from that ſpecious air of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and gentleneſs of manners, which he could aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume or lay aſide whenever he pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Maſquerade, which was no more than their third meeting abroad, completed her ruin, from ſo practiſed, tho' ſo young a deceiver; and that before ſhe well knew ſhe was in danger: For, having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on her to go off with him about Twelve o'clock to his Aunt Forbes's, a Lady of honour and fortune, to whom he had given reaſon to expect her <hi>future Niece</hi> [the only hint of Marriage he ever gave her], he carried her to the houſe of the wicked woman, who bears the name of Sinclair in theſe Papers: And there, by promiſes which ſhe underſtood in the favourable ſenſe (for where a woman loves, ſhe ſeldom doubts enough for her own ſafety) obtained an eaſy conqueſt over a virtue that was little more than nominal.</p>
                     <p>He found it not difficult to induce her to proceed in the guilty commerce, till the effects of it became too apparent to be hid. Her Parents then (in the firſt fury of their diſappointment, and vexation for being deprived of all hopes of ſuch a Son-in-law) turned her out of doors.</p>
                     <p>Her diſgrace thus publiſhed, ſhe became hardened; and, protected by her ſeducer, whoſe favourite Miſtreſs ſhe then was, ſhe was ſo incenſed againſt her Parents, for an indignity ſo little ſuiting with her pride, and the head they had always given her, that ſhe refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to them, when, repenting of their paſſonate treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her, they would have been reconciled to her:
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0041800508:197"/>
And, becoming the favourite Daughter of her Mother Sinclair, at the perſuaſions of that abandoned woman, ſhe practiſed to bring on an abortion, which ſhe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, tho' ſhe was ſo far gone, that it had like to have coſt her her life.</p>
                     <p>Thus, unchaſtity her firſt crime, murder her next, her conſcience became ſeared; and, young as ſhe was, and fond of her deceiver, ſoon grew indelicate enough, having ſo thorough-paced a School-miſtreſs, to do all ſhe could to promote the pleaſures of the man who had ruined her; ſcrupling not, with a ſpirit truly diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, to endeavour to draw in others to follow her example. And it is hardly to be believed what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of this ſort ſhe was the means of effecting; woman confiding in, and daring woman; and ſhe a creature of ſpecious appearance, and great art.</p>
                     <p>A ſtill viler wickedneſs, if poſſible, remains to be ſaid of Sally Martin.</p>
                     <p>Her Father dying, her Mother, in hopes to <hi>reclaim</hi> her, as ſhe called it, propoſed to her to quit the houſe of the infamous Sinclair, and to retire with her into the country, where her diſgrace, and her then wicked way of live, would not be known; and there ſo to life, as to ſave appearances; the only virtue ſhe had ever taught her; beſides that of endeavouring rather to delude than to be deluded.</p>
                     <p>To this Sally conſented; but with no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as ſhe often owned (and gloried in it) than to cheat her Mother of the greateſt part of her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in revenge for conſenting to her being turned out of doors long before, and by way of repriſal for having perſuaded her Father, as ſhe would have it, to cut her off, in his laſt Will, from any ſhare in his fortune.</p>
                     <p>This unnatural wickedneſs, in half a year's time, ſhe brought about; and then the Serpent retired to her obſcene den with her ſpoils, laughing at what ſhe had done; even after it had broken her Mother's

                     <p>It ought to be added, that this was an iniquity, of which neither Mr. Lovelace, nor any of his friends, could bear to hear her boaſt; and always check'd her for it whenever ſhe did; condemning it with one voice: And it is certain, that this and other inſtances of her complicated wickedneſs, turned early Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace's heart againſt her; and, had ſhe not been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to him in his other purſuits, he would not have endured her: For, ſpeaking of her, he would ſay, Let not any one reproach <hi>us,</hi> Jack: <hi>There is no wickedneſs like the wickedneſs of a woman</hi>

                     <p>A bad education was the preparative, it muſt be confeſſed: And for this Sally Martin had reaſon to thank her Parents: As they had reaſon to thank themſelves, for what followed: But, had ſhe not met with a Lovelace, ſhe had avoided a Sinclair; and might have gone on at the common rate of wives ſo educated; and been the Mother of children turned out to take their chance in the world, as ſhe was; ſo many lumps of ſoft was, fit to take any impreſſion that the firſt accident gave them; neither happy, nor making happy; every-thing but uſeful; and well off, if not extremely miſerable.</p>
                     <p>POLLY HORTON was the Daughter of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman well deſcended; whoſe Huſband, a man of family, and of honour, was a Captain in the Guards.</p>
                     <p>He died when Polly was about Nine years of age, leaving her to the care of her Mother, a lively young Lady of about Twenty-ſix; with a genteel proviſion for both.</p>
                     <p>Her Mother was extremely fond of her Polly; but had it not in <hi>herſelf</hi> to manifeſt the true, the genuine fondneſs of a Parent, by a ſtrict and guarded educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; dreſſing out, and viſiting, and being viſited by

the gay of her own Sex, and caſting out her eye abroad, as one very ready to try her fortune again in the married ſtate.</p>
                     <p>This induced thoſe airs, and a love to thoſe diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which make a young widow, of ſo lively a turn, the unfitteſt Tutreſs in the world, even to her own Daughter.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Horton herſelf having had an early turn to Muſic, and that ſort of Reading, which is but an earlier debauchery for young minds, preparative to the groſſer at riper years, to wit, Romances and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, Songs and Plays, and thoſe without diſtinction, moral or immoral, ſhe indulged her Daughter in the ſame taſte; and at thoſe hours, when they could not take part in the more active and lively amuſements and <hi>Kill-times,</hi> as ſome call them, uſed to employ Miſs to read to her; happy enough in her own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, that, while ſhe was diverting her own ears, and ſometimes, as the piece was, corrupting her own heart, and her childs too, ſhe was teaching Miſs to read, and improve her mind; for it was the boaſt of every tea-table half-hour, <hi>That Miſs Horton, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, accent, and emphaſis, ſurpaſſed all the young Ladies of her age:</hi> And, at other times, compliment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pleaſed Mother—<hi>Bleſs me, Madam, with what a ſurpriſing grace Miſs Horton reads!—She enters into the very ſpirit of her ſubject—This ſhe could have from nobody but you!</hi> An intended praiſe; but, as the ſubjects were, would have been a ſevere <hi>ſatire</hi> in the mouth of an enemy! —While the fond, the inconſiderate Mother, with a delighted air, would cry, <hi>Why, I cannot but ſay, Miſs Horton does credit to her Tutreſs!</hi> And then a <hi>Come-hither, my beſt Love!</hi> And, with a kiſs of approbation, <hi>What a pleaſure to your dear Papa, had he lived to ſee your improvements, my Charmer!</hi>—Concluding with a ſigh of ſatisfaction; her eyes turning round upon the circle, to take in all the ſilent applauſes of theirs!
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0041800508:200"/>
But little thought the fond, the fooliſh Mother, what the plant would be, which was ſpringing up from theſe ſeeds! Little imagined ſhe, that her own ruin, as well as her child's, was to be the conſequence of this fine education; and that, in the ſame ill-fated hour, the honour both of Mother and Daughter was to become a ſacrifice to the intriguing Invader.</p>
                     <p>This the laughing girl, when abandoned to her evil deſtiny, and in company with her Siſter Sally, and others, each recounting their ſettings-out, their progreſs, and their fall, frequently related to be her education and manner of training-up.</p>
                     <p>This, and to ſee a ſucceſſion of Humble Servants buzzing about a Mother, who took too much pride in addreſſes of that kind, what a beginning, what an example, to a conſtitution of tinder, ſo prepared to receive the ſpark ſtruck from the ſteely forehead, and flinty heart, of ſuch a Libertine, as at laſt it was their fortune to be encountered by!</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, as Miſs grew up under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of ſuch a Directreſs, and of books ſo light and frothy, with the inflaming additions of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, Concerts, Opera's, Plays, Aſſemblies, Balls, and the reſt of the rabble of amuſements of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern life, it is no wonder, that, like early fruit, ſhe was ſoon ripened to the hand of the inſidious gatherer.</p>
                     <p>At Fifteen, ſhe own'd, ſhe was ready to fanſy herſelf the Heroine of every Novel, and of every Comedy ſhe read, ſo well did ſhe enter into the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of her ſubject: She glowed to become the object of ſome Hero's flame; and perfectly longed to begin an intrigue, and even to be <hi>run away with</hi> by ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing Lover: Yet had neither <hi>Confinement</hi> nor <hi>Check</hi> to apprehend from her indiſcreet Mother: Which ſhe thought abſolutely neceſſary to conſtitute a Partheniſſa!</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, with all theſe fine modern qualities, did ſhe complete her Nineteenth year, before ſhe met
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0041800508:201"/>
with any addreſs of conſequence: One half of her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers being afraid, becauſe of her gay turn, and but middling fortune, to make ſerious applications for her favour; while others were kept at diſtance, by the ſuperior airs ſhe aſſumed; and a third ſort, not ſufficiently penetrating the foibles either of Mother or Daughter, were kept off by the ſuppoſed watchful care of the former.</p>
                     <p>But when the man of intrepidity and intrigue was found, never was Heroine ſo ſoon ſubdued, never Goddeſs ſo early ſtript of her celeſtials! For, at the Opera, a diverſion at which neither ſhe nor her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever miſſed to be preſent, ſhe beheld the ſpecious Lovelace; beheld him inveſted with all the airs of heroic inſult, reſenting a ſlight affront offered to his Sally Martin, by Two gentlemen who had known her in her more hopeful ſtate, one of whom Mr. Lovelace obliged to ſneak away with a broken head, given with the pommel of his ſword, the other with a bloody noſe; neither of them well ſupporting that readineſs of offence, which, it ſeems, was a part of their <hi>known</hi> characters to be guilty of.</p>
                     <p>The gallantry of this action drawing every by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtander on the ſide of the Hero, <hi>O the brave man!</hi> cried Polly Horton aloud, to her Mother, in a kind of rapture, <hi>How needful the protection of the Brave to the Fair!</hi> with a ſoftneſs in her voice, which ſhe had taught herſelf, to ſuit her fanſied <hi>high</hi> condition of life.</p>
                     <p>A ſpeech ſo much in his favour, could not but take the notice of a man who was but too ſenſible of the advantages which his fine perſon, and noble air, gave him over the gentler hearts, who was always watching every female eye, and who had his ear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually turned to every affected voice; for that was one of his indications of a proper ſubject to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted —<hi>Affectation of every ſort,</hi> he uſed to ſay, <hi>is a certain ſign of a wrong-turned head; of a faulty judgment: And upon ſuch a baſis I ſeldom build in vain.</hi>

And Sally whiſperingly gave the young Lady, and her Mother, in her own way, the particulars of the affront ſhe had received; making herſelf an Angel of Light, to caſt the brighter ray upon the character of her heroic Brother. She particularly praiſed his known and approved courage; and mingled with her praiſes of him, ſuch circumſtances relating to his birth, his fortune and endowments, as left him nothing to do but to fall in love with the enamoured Polly.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Lovelace preſently ſaw what turn to give to his profeſſions: <hi>So brave a man! yet of manners ſo gentle!</hi> hit the young Lady's taſte: Nor could ſhe ſuſpect the heart, that ſuch an aſpect cover'd. <hi>This was the man! the very man!</hi> ſhe whiſpered to her Mother: And, when the Opera was over, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant procuring a coach, he undertook, with his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Siſter, to ſet them down at their own lodgings, tho' ſituated a quite different way from his: And there were they prevailed upon to alight, and partake of a ſlight repaſt.</p>
                     <p>Sally preſſed them to return the favour to her at her Aunt Forbes's, and hoped it would be before her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went to his own ſeat.</p>

                     <p>The foregoing Work having been publiſhed at three different periods of time, the Author, in the courſe of its publication, was favoured with many anonymous Letters, in which the Writers differently expreſſed their wiſhes with regard to the apprehended cataſtrophe.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of thoſe directed to him by the gentler Sex, turned in favour of what they called a <hi>Fortunate End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Some of the fair writers, enamoured, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, with the character of the Heroine, were warmly ſolicitous to have her made happy: And others, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of their mind, <hi>inſiſted that Poetical Juſtice</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that it ſhould be ſo. And when, ſays one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Lady, whoſe undoubted motive was good-nature and humanity, it muſt be concluded, that it is in an author's power to make his piece end as he pleaſes, why ſhould he not give pleaſure rather than pain to the Reader whom he has intereſted in favour of his principal characters?</p>
                     <p>Others, and ſome Gentlemen, declared againſt Tragedies in general, and in favour of Comedies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the words of Lovelace, who was ſupported in his taſte by all the women at Mrs. Sinclair's, and by Sinclair herſelf.

                     </p>
                     <p>And how was this happy ending to be brought about? Why, by this very eaſy and trite expedient;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0041800508:205"/>
to wit, by reforming Lovelace, and marrying him to Clariſſa—Not, however, abating her one of her tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, nor any of her ſufferings [for the ſake of the ſport her diſtreſſes would give to the <hi>tender-hearted</hi> reader as ſhe went along] the laſt outrage excepted: That indeed, partly in compliment to Lovelace himſelf, and partly for delicacy-ſake, they were willing to ſpare her.</p>
                     <p>But whatever were the fate of his work, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was reſolved to take a different method. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought, that <hi>ſudden Converſions,</hi> ſuch eſpecially, as were left to the candour of the Reader to <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> and <hi>make out,</hi> had neither <hi>Art,</hi> nor <hi>Nature,</hi> nor even <hi>Probability,</hi> in them; and that they were moreover of very <hi>bad</hi> example. To have a Lovelace for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of years glory in his wickedneſs, and think that he had nothing to do, but as an act of grace and favour to hold out his hand to receive that of the beſt of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whenever he pleaſed, and to have it thought, that Marriage would be a ſufficient amends for all his enormities to others, as well as to her; he could not bear that. Nor is Reformation, as he has ſhewn in another piece, to be ſecured by a fine face; by a paſſion that has ſenſe for its object; nor by the goodneſs of a Wife's heart, or even example, if the heart of the Huſband be not graciouſly touched by the Divine Finger.</p>
                     <p>It will be ſeen by this time, that the Author had a great end in view. He has lived to ſee Scepticiſm and Infidelity openly avowed, and even endeavoured to be propagated from the <hi>Preſs:</hi> The great doctrines of the Goſpel brought into queſtion: Thoſe of ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial and mortification blotted out of the catalogue of chriſtian virtues: And a taſte even to wantonneſs for out-door pleaſure and luxury, to the general excluſion of domeſtic as well as public virtue, induſtriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted among all ranks and degrees of people.</p>
                     <p>In this general depravity, when even the Pulpit has
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0041800508:206"/>
loſt great part of its weight, and the Clergy are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a body of <hi>intereſted</hi> men, the Author thought, he ſhould be able to anſwer it to his own heart, be the ſucceſs what it would, if he threw in his mite towards introducing a Reformation ſo much wanted: And he imagined, that if in an age given up to diverſion and entertainment, he could <hi>ſteal in,</hi> as may be ſaid, and inveſtigate the great doctrines of Chriſtianity under the faſhionable guiſe of an amuſement; he ſhould be moſt likely to ſerve his purpoſe; remembring that of the Poet:
<q>
                           <l>A verſe may find him who a ſermon flies,</l>
                           <l>And turn delight into a ſacrifice.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was reſolved therefore to attempt ſomething that never yet had been done. He conſidered, that the Tragic poets have as ſeldom made their heroes true ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of pity, as the Comic theirs laudable ones of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: And ſtill more rarely have made them in their deaths look forward to a <hi>future Hope.</hi> And thus, when they die, they ſeem totally to periſh. Death, in ſuch inſtances, muſt appear terrible. It muſt be conſidered as the greateſt evil. But why is Death ſet in ſhocking lights, when it is the univerſal lot?</p>
                     <p>He has indeed thought fit to paint the death of the wicked as terrible as he could paint it. But he has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to draw that of the good in ſuch an amiable manner, that the very Balaams of the world ſhould not forbear to wiſh that their latter end might be like that of the Heroine.</p>
                     <p>And after all, what is the <hi>Poetical Juſtice</hi> ſo much contended for by ſome, as the generality of writers have managed it, but another ſort of diſpenſation than that with which God, by Revelation, teaches us, He has thought fit to exerciſe mankind; whom placing here only in a ſtate of probation, he hath ſo intermingled good and evil, as to neceſſitate us to look forward for a more equal diſpenſation of both?</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Several perſons have cenſured the Heroine as too
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0041800508:212"/>
cold in her love, too haughty, and even ſometimes provoking. But we may preſume to ſay, that this objection has ariſen from want of attention to the Story, to the Character of Clariſſa, and to her parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Situation.</p>
                     <p>It was not intended that ſhe ſhould be <hi>in Love,</hi> but <hi>in Liking</hi> only, if that expreſſion may be admitted. It is meant to be every-where inculcated in the Story, for <hi>Example-ſake,</hi> that ſhe never would have married Mr. Lovelace, becauſe of his immoralities, had ſhe been left to herſelf; and that her ruin was principally owing to the perſecutions of her friends.</p>
                     <p>What is too generally called <hi>Love,</hi> ought (perhaps <hi>as</hi> generally) to be called by another name. <hi>Cupidity,</hi> or a <hi>Paphian Stimulus,</hi> as ſome women, even of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, have acted, are not words too harſh to be ſubſtituted on the occaſion, however grating they may be to delicate ears. But take the word <hi>Love</hi> in the gentleſt and moſt honourable ſenſe, it would have been thought by ſome highly improbable, that Clariſſa ſhould have been able to ſhew ſuch a command of her paſſions, as makes ſo diſtinguiſhing a part of her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, had ſhe been as violently in Love, as certain warm and fierce ſpirits would have had her to be. A few Obſervations are thrown in by way of Note in the preſent Edition, at proper places, to obviate this Objection, or rather to beſpeak the <hi>Attention</hi> of haſty Readers to what lies obviouſly before them. For thus the Heroine anticipates this very Objection, expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating with Miſs Howe on her contemptuous treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mr. Hickman; which [far from being guilty of the ſame fault herſelf] ſhe did on all occaſions, and declares ſhe would do, whenever Miſs Howe forgot herſelf, altho' ſhe had not a day to live:</p>

                     <p>It has been thought by ſome worthy and ingenious perſons, that if Lovelace had been drawn an <hi>Infidel</hi> or <hi>Scoffer,</hi> his Character, according to the Taſte of the preſent worſe than Sceptical Age, would have been more natural. It is, however, too well known, that there are very many perſons, of his Caſt, whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions diſcredit their belief. And are not the very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, in Scripture, ſaid to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>tremble?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Reader muſt have obſerved, that great, and, it is hoped, good Uſe, has been made throughout the Work, by drawing Lovelace an Infidel only in <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>; and this as well in the arguments of his friend Belford, as in his own frequent Remorſes, when touched with temporary Compunction, and in his laſt Scenes; which could not have been made, had either of them been painted as <hi>ſentimental</hi> Unbelievers. Not to ſay, that Clariſſa, whoſe great Objection to Mr. Wyerley was, that he was a Scoffer, muſt have been inexcuſeable had ſhe known Lovelace to be ſo, and had given the leaſt attention to his Addreſſes. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, thus ſhe comforts herſelf, when ſhe thinks ſhe
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0041800508:214"/>
muſt be his—
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'This one conſolation, however, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains: He is not an Infidel, an Unbeliever. Had he been an Infidel, there would have been no room at all for hope of him; but (priding himſelf as he does in his fertile invention) he would have been utterly abandoned, irreclaimable, and a Savage <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. IV. p. 246.</note>.'</q>
And it muſt be obſerved, that Scoffers are too witty in their own opinion; in other words, value themſelves too much upon their profligacy, to aim at concealing it.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, had Lovelace added ribbald jeſts upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to his other liberties, the freedoms which would then have paſſed between him and his friend, muſt have been of a nature truly infernal. And this far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hint was meant to be given, by way of inference, that the man who allowed himſelf in thoſe liberties either of ſpeech or action, which Lovelace thought ſhameful, was ſo far a worſe man than Lovelace. For this reaſon is he every-where made to treat jeſts on ſacred things and ſubjects, even down to the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thology of the Pagans, among Pagans, as undoubted marks of the ill-breeding of the jeſters; obſcene images and talk, as liberties too ſhameful for even Rakes to allow themſelves in; and injuſtice to creditors, and in matters of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> as what it was beneath him to be guilty of.</p>
                     <p>Some have objected to the meekneſs, to the tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as they will have it to be, of the character of Mr. Hickman. And yet Lovelace owns, that he roſe upon him with great ſpirit in the interview between them; once, when he thought a reflection was but implied on <hi>Miſs Howe</hi> 
                        <note n="(b)" place="bottom">See Vol. VI. p. 207.</note>; and another time, when he imagined <hi>himſelf</hi> treated contemptuouſly <note n="(c)" place="bottom">See Vol. VI. p. 210.</note>. Miſs Howe, it muſt be owned (tho' not to the credit of her own character) treats him ludicrouſly on ſeveral occaſions. But ſo ſhe does her Mother. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a Lady of her lively turn would have treated as
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0041800508:215"/>
whimſically any man but a Lovelace. Mr. Belford ſpeaks of him with honour and reſpect <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vol. VI. p. 260, 261.</note>. So does Colonel Morden <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Vol. VII. p. 357.</note>. And ſo does Clariſſa on every occaſion. And all that Miſs Howe herſelf ſays of him, tends more to his reputation than diſcredit <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Vol. II. p. 4 —8. and Vol. III. p. 194.</note>, as Clariſſa indeed tells her <note n="(d)" place="bottom">See Vol. II. p. 51.</note>.</p>
                     <p>And as to Lovelace's treatment of him, the Reader muſt have obſerved, that it was his way to treat every man with contempt, partly by way of ſelf-exaltation, and partly to gratify the natural gaiety of his diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He ſays himſelf to Belford <note n="(e)" place="bottom">Vol. VI. p. 199.</note>,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'Thou knoweſt I love him not, Jack; and whom we love not, we cannot allow a merit to; perhaps not the merit they ſhould be granted.'</q>
'Modeſt and diffident men,' writes Belford, to Lovelace, in praiſe of Mr. Hick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'wear not ſoon off thoſe little preciſeneſſes, which the confident, if ever they had them, preſently get over.'</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, as Miſs Howe treats her Mother as freely as ſhe does her Lover; ſo does Mr. Lovelace take ſtill greater liberties with Mr. Belford, than he does with Mr. Hickman, with reſpect to his perſon, air, and addreſs, as Mr. Belford himſelf hints to Mr. Hick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note n="(f)" place="bottom">Vol. VII. p. 315.</note>. And yet he is not ſo readily believed to the diſcredit of Mr. Belford, by the Ladies in general, as he is when he diſparages Mr. Hickman. Whence can this partiality ariſe?—</p>
                     <p>

                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0041800508:216"/>Nevertheleſs, it muſt be owned, that it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to draw Mr. Hickman, as the man of whom the Ladies in general were likely to be very fond. Had it been ſo, <hi>Goodneſs of heart,</hi> and <hi>Gentleneſs of manners, great Aſſiduity,</hi> and <hi>inviolable</hi> and <hi>modeſt</hi> Love, would not of themſelves have been ſuppoſed ſufficient recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations. He would not have been allowed the leaſt ſhare of <hi>preciſeneſs</hi> or <hi>formality,</hi> altho' thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects might have been imputed to his reverence for the object of his paſſion: But in his character it was deſigned to ſhew, that the ſame man could not be every-thing; and to intimate to Ladies, that in chuſing companions for life, they ſhould rather prefer the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt heart of a Hickman, which would be all their own, than to riſque the chance of ſharing, perhaps with ſcores, (and ſome of thoſe probably the moſt profligate of the Sex) the volatile miſchievous one of a Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace: In ſhort, that they ſhould chuſe, if they wiſhed for durable happineſs, for rectitude of mind, and not for ſpeciouſneſs of perſon or addreſs: Nor make a jeſt of a good man in favour of a bad one, who would make a jeſt of them and of their whole Sex.</p>
                     <p>Two Letters, however, by way of accommodation, are inſerted in this edition, which perhaps will give Mr. Hickman's character ſome heightening with ſuch Ladies, as love ſpirit in a man; and had rather ſuffer by it, than not meet with it.—

                     <p>Says Waller—And Lovelace too!</p>
                     <p>Some have wiſhed that the Story had been told in the uſual narrative way of telling Stories deſigned to amuſe and divert, and not in Letters written by the reſpective perſons whoſe hiſtory is given in them. The Author thinks he ought not to preſcribe to the taſte of others; but imagined himſelf at liberty to follow his own. He perhaps miſtruſted his talents for the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0041800508:217"/>
kind of writing. He had the good fortune to ſucceed in the Epiſtolary way once before. A Story in which ſo many perſons were concerned either prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally or collaterally, and of characters and diſpoſitions ſo various, carried on with tolerable connexion and perſpicuity, in a ſeries of Letters from different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, without the aid of digreſſions and epiſodes foreign to the principal end and deſign, he thought had <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty</hi> to be pleaded for it: And that, in the preſent age, he ſuppoſed would not be a ſlight recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>But beſides what has been ſaid above, and in the <hi>Preface,</hi> on this head, the following opinion of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and candid Foreigner, on this manner of writing, may not be improperly inſerted here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q rend="inline margQuotes">'The method which the Author has purſued in the Hiſtory of Clariſſa, is the ſame as in the Life of Pamela: Both are related in familiar Letters by the parties themſelves, at the very time in which the events happened: And this method has given the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor great advantages, which he could not have drawn from any other ſpecies of narration. The minute par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of events, the ſentiments and converſation of the parties, are, upon this plan, exhibited with all the warmth and ſpirit, that the paſſion ſuppoſed to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant at the very time, could produce, and with all the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtics which memory can ſupply in a Hiſtory of recent tranſactions.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Romances in general, and Marivaux's amongſt others, are wholly improbable; becauſe they ſuppoſe the Hiſtory to be written after the ſeries of events is cloſed by the cataſtrophe: A circumſtance which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a ſtrength of memory beyond all example and probability in the perſons concerned, enabling them, at the diſtance of ſeveral years, to relate all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of a tranſient converſation: Or rather, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a yet more improbable confidence and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity between all theſe perſons and the author.</q>

                        <q rend="inline margQuotes">'There is, however, one difficulty attending the Epiſtolary method; for it is neceſſary, that all the characters ſhould have an uncommon taſte for this kind of converſation, and that they ſhould ſuffer no event, nor even a remarkable converſation, to paſs, without immediately committing it to writing. But for the preſervation of the Letters <hi>once written,</hi> the author has provided with great judgment, ſo as to render this circumſtance highly probable <note n="(a)" place="bottom">This quotation is tranſlated from a CRITIQUE on the HISTORY of CLARISSA, written in French, and publiſhed at Amſterdam.

                     <p>It is preſumed that what this gentleman ſays of the difficulties attending a Story thus given in the Epiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary manner of writing, will not be found to reach the Hiſtory before us. It is very well accounted for in it, how the two principal Female characters come to take ſo great a delight in writing. Their ſubjects are not merely ſubjects of amuſement; but greatly intereſting to both: Yet many Ladies there are who now lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly correſpond, when at diſtance from each other, on occaſions that far leſs affect their mutual welfare and friendſhips, than thoſe treated of by theſe Ladies. The two principal gentlemen had motives of gaiety and vain-glory for their inducements. It will generally be found, that perſons who have talents for familiar write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as theſe correſpondents are preſumed to have, will not forbear amuſing themſelves with their pens, on leſs arduous occaſions than what offer to theſe. Theſe FOUR (whoſe Stories have a connexion with each other) out of a great number of characters which are introduced in this Hiſtory, are only eminent in the Epiſtolary way: The reſt appear but as occaſional writers, and as drawn in rather by neceſſity than

                     <p>Some there are, and Ladies too! who have ſuppoſed that the excellencies of the Heroine are carried to an improbable, and even to an impracticable height, in this Hiſtory. But the education of Clariſſa from <hi>early childhood</hi> ought to be conſidered, as one of her very great advantages; as, indeed, the foundation of <hi>all</hi> her excellencies: And it is hoped, for the ſake of the doctrine deſigned to be inculcated by it, that it will.</p>
                     <p>She had a pious, a well-re'd, a not meanly-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended woman for her Nurſe, who with her milk, as Mrs. Harlowe ſays <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. IV. p. 34.</note>, gave her that nurture which no other Nurſe could give her. She was very early happy in the converſation-viſits of her learned and worthy Dr. Lewen, and in her correſpondencies, not with him only, but with other Divines mentioned in her laſt Will. Her Mother was, upon the whole, a good woman, who did credit to her birth and her fortune; and <hi>both</hi> delighted in her for thoſe improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and attainments, which gave her, <hi>and them in her,</hi> a diſtinction that cauſed it to be ſaid, that when ſhe was out of the family, it was conſidered but as a common family <note n="(b)" place="bottom">See Vol. VII. p. 37. See alſo her Mother's praiſes of her to Mrs. Norton, Vol. I. p. 258.</note>. She was moreover a Country Lady; and, as we have ſeen in Miſs Howe's charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of her <note n="(c)" place="bottom">See Vol. VII. p. 385.</note>, took great delight in rural and houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold employments; tho' qualified to adorn the brighteſt circle.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that we are not to look for <hi>Clariſſa's</hi> among the <hi>conſtant frequenters</hi> of Ranelagh and Vaux-hall, nor among thoſe who may be called <hi>Daughters of the Card-table.</hi> If we do, the character
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0041800508:220"/>
of our Heroine may then indeed be juſtly thought not only improbable, but unattainable. But we have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther room in this place, nor inclination, to purſue a ſubject ſo invidious. We quit it therefore, after we have <hi>repeated,</hi> that we <hi>know</hi> there are <hi>ſome,</hi> and we <hi>hope</hi> there are <hi>many,</hi> in the Britiſh dominions [or they are hardly any-where in the European world] who, as far as <hi>occaſion</hi> has called upon them to exert the like <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>modeſt,</hi> yet <hi>ſteady</hi> and <hi>uſeful,</hi> virtues, have reached the perfections of a Clariſſa.</p>
                     <p>Having thus briefly taken notice of the moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial objections that have been made to different parts of this Hiſtory, it is hoped we may be allowed to add, That had we thought ourſelves at liberty to give copies of ſome of the many Letters that have been written on the other ſide of the queſtion, that is to ſay, in appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Cataſtrophe, and of the general Conduct and Execution of the work, by ſome of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent judges of compoſition in every branch of Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; moſt of what has been written in this Poſtſcript might have been ſpared.</p>
