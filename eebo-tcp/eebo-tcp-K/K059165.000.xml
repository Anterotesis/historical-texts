            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OF SOME
TRANSACTIONS
DURING
The late MINISTRY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>VVHEN there is ſuch a
general Expectation of
ſome great Matter to
be made appear againſt
the Perſon theſe Sheets relate to; and
much Pains is taken to calumniate
and miſrepreſent him to the World;
it may not be amiſs to give the
World ſome true State of his Caſe,
that none may be impos'd upon thro'
Ignorance, how far ſoever Malice
may carry ſome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0044702100:3"/>
The Matter draws towards a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis;
the Queſtion will ſoon be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd,
from between Party and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to a Bar of Juſtice; and the
Blood of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobleman is to
be the Subject of the Pleadings and
Defence.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> ſeems to reſolve
to appear, and to ſtand in his own
Defence. I advance one thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Doors in Defence of his Caſe in
general, before the Particulars come
to be enquired into. If it be juſt to
ſay of my Lord <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> that he
knows himſelf to be guilty, why elſe
did he fly? It will be as reaſonable to
ſay of my Lord of <hi>Oxford,</hi> he is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in his own Innocence, why elſe
does he ſtay?</p>
            <p>Beſides the Opinion his Lordſhip
has of his own Innocence, it muſt
be acknowledg'd, his Lordſhip pays
the greateſt Honour to the <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Nobility that is poſſible to do, and
perhaps more than was ever done
before; that however the Turns of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0044702100:4"/>
the Government ſince his Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
may have given Impreſſions
of things very different from what
were in his Time; and as it might
be ſuggeſted, very much to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage;
nay, however Intereſt
may ſeeem to run, even in a very
ſtrong Stream againſt him; yet that
he pays ſuch a profound Reſpect to
the unſpotted Honour of the Peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
as to caſt his Life into their
Hands, at a Time when Thoughts
leſs generous might be apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
ſome Fears of the Impreſſions,
which Party might have made on
the Minds of the Nobility, at a
Time when it is ſcarce to be ſaid,
that any other Sett of Men in the
Nation are entirely free.</p>
            <p>Either my L. <hi>O</hi>—muſt have
ſome ſurprizing Evidence in himſelf
of his own Innocence; and not only
ſo, but of his being able to ſet that
Innocence in a clear Light to the
World; or elſe he makes the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Compliment to the Nobility of
<hi>Britain</hi> that ever Man made. He
ſuppoſes their Lordſhips untainted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0044702100:5"/>
with the Prejudice of the Times; and
that nothing can byafs their Minds,
nothing artfully prepoſſeſs their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
that they cannot be blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by any humane Infirmities, mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by any Paſſions, impoſed upon
by the Perſwaſions, or affected by
private Views of any kind; that
they cannot be hurry'd by popular
Winds or Storms, from whatever
Corner they may blow, whether of
Faction, Tumult, Envy, or Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But that they will move in a
direct Path of Juſtice, guided by
Truth, without the leaſt Deviation
or Inclination one Way or other, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from Parties, Perſons, Intereſt,
or Power, of any kind whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, his Lordſhip ſeems to
pay a moſt dutiful and honourable
Regard to the perſonal Juſtice, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
and Honour of His Majeſty;
declaring, by thus putting himſelf on
his Trial, at ſuch a Juncture as this,
that he firmly depends upon His
Majeſty's Royal Virtue; that nothing
will, on the King's Part, be offered
or encouraged to byaſs, or lead to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0044702100:6"/>
awe, or any Way influence the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that ſhall be given in his Caſe;
that ſhall not ſo much as be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
that the Votes of the Peers,
one Way or other, ſhall in the leaſt
affect them in their Intereſt, or in
the Favour of His Majeſty.</p>
            <p>It muſt be acknowledged, that in
this his Lordſhip acts from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of great Juſtice and Duty, as
well to His Majeſty, as to the Houſe
of Peers; and no Man can ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
manifeſt Injury to his Majeſty,
or to that Honourable Houſe, that
he ſo much as believes his Lordſhip
will be the worſt treated for that
dutiful and generous Behaviour.</p>
            <p>Without Doors we cannot ſay it
will be the ſame; it were to be
wiſhed, the People, who ſhew ſuch
a Warmth in their Deſires to bring
on the Trial of this Lord, would
ſhew the like Diſpoſition to having
him fairly acquitted, if his Innocence
ſhall appear, as they ſeem to ſhew
for his Deſtruction, on a Preſumption
of his Guilt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0044702100:7"/>
It is now come to the great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion:
Nothing leſs than his Life,
or his Death, is the Caſe. If we
were to make a Judgment of him
by the Opinions and Tempers of Men
without Doors, it would be eaſy to
conclude, what ſhould be his Fate;
and his Courage muſt be thought
greater than his Diſcretion, to put
himſelf upon his Tryal; which
makes the Honour done to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and Impartiality of His Majeſty,
and the Peers, of which mention is
made already, be the greater.</p>
            <p>Yet we would hope, that ſeeing it
is now brought this length, Men
will begin to be more ſerious, and
forbear to importune the Juſtice
of the Nation, by their Invectives,
and indecent Treatment: My Lord
has appealed from the Clamours of
the People, to the Juſtice and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Peers; and being thus
in the Hands of Juſtice, what is there
that Men can deſire more? They
who occupy their Pens or Tongues,
now to blacken, defame, or reproach
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0044702100:8"/>
him, openly challenge the Houſe of
Peers, reproach their Juſtice, and
villify that Auguſt Aſſembly, as if
not diſpoſed to do Juſtice in the
Caſe when it comes before them:
As his Lordſhip has thrown himſelf
upon the Honour and Juſtice of the
Peers, and put his Life and Honour
into their Lordſhips Hands; ſo
ſhould we do, and not either lead
or direct them, which would be, in
the groſſeſt Manner, to ſuſpect their
Proceedings.</p>
            <p>The Clamours which have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
been made on this Account, have
been, as the Authors pretended, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to have Men impeached; and we
have ſeen Writers tell the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>They expect it:</hi> It is now done,
we hope they will be ſatisfy'd, and
not tell the Houſe of Peers, whether
they ſhall acquit or condemn: This
muſt be left in their own Breaſts;
and there is no Doubt but they will
act as Juſtice, and their own Honour,
ſhall direct; and of this we muſt all
wait the Iſſue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0044702100:9"/>
That we may attend this great
Event with leſs Curioſity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
it may be proper to ſtate
the Facts of this noble Lord's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
as they appear at preſent in
thoſe very Caſes wherein he is ſo
much impugned and attack'd, that
when People have cool Thoughts
about them, they may be diſpoſed
to read them over; perhaps when
they have done ſo, they will be the
backwarder to blame the Houſe of
Peers, if they ſhould not find it as
they may expect.</p>
            <p>In the latter End of King <hi>William</hi>'s
Reign, we found Mr. <hi>Harley</hi> choſen
Speaker of the Houſe of Commons.
He was, in the Seſſion before, one of
thoſe Members, who ſtood firm to the
Reſolution of disbanding the Army;
having always an Opinion, that the
Security of the Prince was ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provided for in the Affection of
his faithful Commons; and that all
the Dangers, which, as was then
pretended, appeared from the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Power of <hi>France,</hi> were far leſs,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0044702100:10"/>
and eaſier to be ſtruggled with, in
any Incident which might happen,
than thoſe which might proceed from
a ſtanding Force of Mercenaries, to
be kept up in Time of Peace; by
which very thing this Kingdom had
more than once been in great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of having her Liberty over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed,
and the worſt of Slavery
entailed upon her; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the War being over, the Nation
ought to take effectual Care of their
own Liberties; and to limit the
Number of the Forces to ſuch, and no
more, as might be thought ſufficient
for the publick Safety.</p>
            <p>It was not altogether ſo agreeable to
His Majeſty's Thoughts at that Time,
as could have been wiſh'd; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
the Regiment of <hi>Dutch</hi>
Guards were exceedingly deſired by
the King; but it could not be: The
Members declar'd, That it was not
from a Jealouſy or Diſreſpect for the
Perſon of His Majeſty, who, they
were throughly ſatisfied, would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
himſelf, or by his Permiſſion,
ever ſuffer an Army to oppreſs them;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0044702100:11"/>
but that the Precedent would be
dangerous to Poſterity, when the
Succeſſors of His Majeſty might,
perhaps, make a fatal Uſe of that
Advantage, of which he would make
no Advantage at all.</p>
            <p>It was reported at that Time,
that Mr. <hi>Harley</hi> was choſen againſt
the Meaſures of the Court; and that
the King was diſobliged by him to
the laſt Degree, on Account of the
aforeſaid breaking of the Forces. But
His Majeſty himſelf removed the
Scandal of that Rumour, by aſſuring
Mr. <hi>Harley,</hi> that he was very well
ſatisfy'd with him; and indeed the
Principles upon which the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Gentlemen went at that Time, were
ſo evidently eſſential to the preſerving
their Liberties, that the King himſelf,
who was a great Patron of Liberty,
was perfectly ſatisfy'd with the thing
afterwards; and likewiſe with the
Perſons, expreſſing a very particular
Eſteem for Mr. <hi>Harley</hi> to the Time
of his Death, which happened ſoon
after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0044702100:12"/>
At the Acceſſion of the Queen to
the Crown, Her Majeſty was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to chuſe Her Miniſtry among a
Sett of Men, who, there was ſome
Reaſon to have expected other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
from them to Her Majeſty, at
leaſt the Queen expected it; but
they who knew them better, were
not ſo much diſappointed in them as
Her Majeſty was.</p>
            <p>It imports not to record their Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
farther than thus; to let Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
know, they began to precipitate
the Crown, in many Caſes, to a Degree
that muſt, in Time, have been fatal.</p>
            <p>In all theſe Caſes Mr. <hi>Harley</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized
himſelf, by that famous Stand
which he made in Behalf of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of his Country; of which
thoſe who ſhared in the Advantage
cannot entirely forget the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
Thoſe who were neareſt the
<hi>Queen,</hi> and moſt faithful to Her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
finding the Influence he had
in the Houſe, was of uſe to them on
many Accounts, began, about this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0044702100:13"/>
Time, to ſee he was a Perſon neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to keep a cloſer Correſpondence
with; and having found the <hi>Queen</hi>
of the ſame Opinion, he was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the Cabinet Meaſures, and
the niceſt Affairs communicated to
him.</p>
            <p>In this Station he obtain'd, upon
the Opinion not only of the Perſons
who he neceſſarily was embark'd
with; as the late E. of <hi>Godolphin,</hi> the
Duke of <hi>M</hi>—and ſome others;
but of the <hi>Queen</hi> more eſpecially,
who, with my L. <hi>Godolphin,</hi> had a
ſingular Eſteem for him.</p>
            <p>It was eaſy for Mr. <hi>Harley,</hi> in this
Scituation, to convince Her Majeſty,
of the abſolute Neceſſity She was in,
of changing Her Meaſures, and of
diſmiſſing a furious Faction, who
began to be odious to the People, by
their puſhing the Government upon
ſuch things as tended to embroil Her
Majeſty with Her beſt Subjects; and
make the War abroad, which was
then newly entred into, be either
impracticable, or unſucceſsful, by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0044702100:14"/>
reaſon of the Diſcontents at Home,
which were riſing to a great Height
among the People, and ſometimes
between the Two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
themſelves.</p>
            <p>In the Purſuit of this Council, the
Advantage whereof the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
feels to this Day, the <hi>Queen</hi> was
pleaſed to diſmiſs Sir <hi>Edward Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>'s
Party, ſo they were call'd, and
fill up the Houſhold with ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
as the preſent Age pretends to
be very well ſatisfy'd in; the prime
Miniſtry, as it is call'd, reſting in
the late Lord Treaſurer <hi>Godolphin;</hi>
the Army, in the D. of <hi>M</hi>—<hi>h;</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Harley</hi> was made Secretary of
State, in the Room of the E. of
<hi>N</hi>—<hi>m;</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Hedges</hi>
keeping the Seals as the other Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of State, as he was before.</p>
            <p>Thus the Introduction of that
Miniſtry was the Work of Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley;</hi>
and it was to his Counſels that
they ow'd their being eſtabliſhed in
the full Adminiſtration of Affairs;
which, whilſt they carry'd on with
Unanimity of Councils, and without
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0044702100:15"/>
Jealouſy of one another, were admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
with great Satisfaction to Her
Majeſty, and all Her People at
Home, as well as with glorious Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
abroad; during this Time,
the Animoſities among the good
People began exceedingly to abate;
the Remembrances of <hi>Occaſional Bills,
Tackings,</hi> &amp;c. wore much off of the
Minds of the People, and the Court
generally diſcouraging the Breaches
among the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Subjects; an open
and free Adminiſtration was carry'd
on, by which Room was left for all
Her Majeſty's Subjects, of whatever
Party, to reſtore themſelves to Her
Favour, by their Merit; and to wipe
out the Remembrances of any Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
by a future dutiful Behaviour.
A Method of Government exceedingly
agreeable to the <hi>Queen,</hi> as it would,
had it gone on, have been, in Time,
healing to the Nation.</p>
            <p>But this happy Scheme was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
pleaſing to all; and ſome, who
had Cravings in Nature to ſatisfy,
which were not ſo conſiſtent with
this diſintereſted Manner of Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0044702100:16"/>
began to be uneaſy at the
Apprehenſions of letting in the Mob,
as it was call'd, into their Affairs.
The Intereſt in Her Majeſty, which,
as it was call'd, was not a thing of
ſo little Value to be laid open, and
Her Favour and Confidence to be
made Common to the People:
They found that as they had made
it a Property, ſo their Succeſs gave
them an Advantage above all that
went before them, by ſeeming to
make themſelves neceſſary to Her
Majeſty: This Point was carried
on to ſuch an Extremity, the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of governing, even their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
alluring, that finding Mr.
<hi>Harley</hi> inflexible; and that he would
not join in ſuch narrow Meaſures;
but deſir'd, that the <hi>Queen</hi> might
Reign for Her ſelf, and all Her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
have Acceſs to Her; that She
might be fully apprized of all Her
Affairs; and act as well by Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
as Advice: Finding this was
the Scheme he had laid; and
that it was directly oppoſite to their
own, and would, in the End, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
it: They from that Time
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0044702100:17"/>
entred into Meaſures either to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
him in Her Majeſty's Favour,
or in his Employment.</p>
            <p>The firſt, notwithſtanding many
Miſrepreſentations and mean Steps
taken, they could not effect; the laſt,
they brought to paſs for a Seaſon.</p>
            <p>It ſeems that they brought the laſt
to paſs with Difficulty; and it was
evident to them, as alſo to others,
that as her Majeſty parted not with
Mr. <hi>Harley</hi> without great Reluctance;
ſo that altho' he was diſmiſs'd from
the Office of her principal Secretary,
that yet he had acceſs to her Perſon,
and had opportunity to communicate
ſuch Councils as occaſion offer'd, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Honour, from that time, of a
Confidence with his Sovereign, which
thoſe, who had Power to diſplace him,
had then no Share in.</p>
            <p>This Favour of his Prince was
much encreaſed by ſome foul things
which had been diſcover'd to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to have been practiſed upon him,
in order to render him ſuſpected to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0044702100:18"/>
be concern'd in the Treaſon of Mr.
<hi>Gregg,</hi> and more eſpecially by ſome
Steps which were privately taken by
ſome Perſons, in order, by Fear of
Death, or Hope of Mercy, to induce
the ſaid <hi>Gregg,</hi> when under Sentence
of Death, to accuſe Mr. <hi>Harley;</hi> and
as her Majeſty receiv'd the Account
of thoſe Deſigns with Tokens of great
Diſpleaſure, and even of Deteſtation;
ſo the Declaration which the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
gave, even juſt before his Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of the Innocence of Mr. <hi>Harley<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as
it was a particular Satisfaction to the
Queen, ſo it confirm'd the Opinion
her Majeſty had conceived of Mr.
<hi>Harley,</hi> as a Perſon proper to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted,
and fit to be employed in her
Service.</p>
            <p>It might have been uſeful to have
deſcended to the Particulars of this
Matter, and to the Perſons likewiſe,
but another time may be thought
more proper; this ſuffices to ſhew,
that there was at that time a horrid
Conſpiracy againſt the Life of this
noble Lord; how far it has been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on, or revived ſince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0044702100:19"/>
it be by the ſame Hands or not,
will likewiſe appear, the Time being
approaching, when there may be reaſon
to lay the blackeſt part of this Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
open to the View of the Sun.</p>
            <p>Mean time, it is worth notice, that
as the Perſons concerned would not
have failed to have accepted the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of Mr. <hi>Gregg</hi> againſt Mr.
<hi>Harley,</hi> if he had either known any
thing whereof to accuſe him, or had
been prevailed with to have forged
any Accuſation, in order to have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his Life; yet ſome of them were
not backward to depretiate the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Words of the ſame Man, when it
appeared they tended to clear the
Perſon, who they deſired rather ſhould
have been accuſed; diſcovering thereby
ſuch a Partiality as her Majeſty was
pleaſed to take notice of, to be as cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
in its Degree, as the Deſign
aforeſaid againſt his Life. <hi>It's ſtrange,</hi>
ſaid ſhe once upon that Occaſion, <hi>that
they would not have us believe the Man
now he acquits Mr.</hi> Harley, <hi>when they
would have believed him if he had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him;</hi> and <hi>that they will not believe the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0044702100:20"/>
Man's dying Words, when it is evident
they would have laid great Weight upon
them if he had lived;</hi> her Majeſty was
pleaſed likewiſe many times, when
this Affair was, upon any Occaſion,
mention'd to her, to expreſs her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
that any Methods ſo unchriſtian
and unjuſt ſhould be taken by Perſons
ſo near Her, to deſtroy an innocent
Perſon.</p>
            <p>Yet could not this put a Stop to the
Enemies of Mr. <hi>Harley,</hi> who, it ſeems,
were reſtleſs in their own Scituation,
while they obſerved his to be ſo near
her Majeſty's Perſon as would, upon
all Occaſions, interrupt the farther
Deſigns which they had calculated for
their own Advantage, in being ſingle
and uninterrupted in the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and therefore, tho' they could
not impoſe upon her Majeſty in the
Caſe above-mention'd of Mr. <hi>Gregg,</hi>
they left not any Stone unturn'd to
keep the People of their own Party
deceived, and to have it, by Pamphlet-Writings,
and private Emiſſaries,
ſuggeſted throughout the Kingdom,
that Mr. <hi>Harley</hi> was guilty of <hi>Gregg</hi>'s
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0044702100:21"/>
Treaſon, tho' nothing could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that ever juſtified ſo much as a
Suſpicion. And altho' <hi>Gregg</hi> himſelf,
who could never have been convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
but by his own Confeſſion,
had been induced by Mr. <hi>Harley</hi> to
make that Confeſſion; ſo that Mr.
<hi>Harley</hi> ſeemed that way to have been
the very Inſtrument of detecting him
more fully, and by conſequence of
his Death; a Provocation ſufficient to
make any one expect, that if he could
have ſaved his Life at Mr. <hi>Harley</hi>'s
Expence, he would have made no
Difficulty of the Exchange, and not a
little the Reaſon of that <hi>low Step</hi> ſome
Perſons (otherwiſe Perſons of Honour)
took to bring it to paſs, which it may
be believed they would not for their
own Sakes have been ſeen in, if they
had thought it could have failed of
Succeſs.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Gregg,</hi> tho' a Traytor, would
not be a Murtherer. Whether they
were not ſo, who endeavoured to make
him ſo, will be tryed at another Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0044702100:22"/>
As theſe things concurr'd to improve
that Intereſt which Mr. <hi>Harley</hi> had
in her Majeſty's Favour, ſo it made
way for, and not a little contributed
to the Breaches which followed, and
the Impreſſions they made in her
Majeſty, in Prejudice of thoſe Men
who were concern'd, were ſuch as
were not eaſily wiped out. Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
who was a Princeſs of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Piety, believing that Men, who
could ſtoop to ſuch wicked, and even
bloody Methods, to remove a Perſon
out of the Way of their Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
would ſtick at few things that
could occur, and were ill qualify'd to
bring about the Bleſſing of Her
Reign, in the Felicity of Her Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which was Her utmoſt Deſire.</p>
            <p>But things were not yet brought
to Maturity, nor the Grievance of
the Adminiſtration come to its Height;
and ſeveral things were yet to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
which ſhould concur with the
Impreſſions Her Majeſty had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
before, to leſſen the Pleaſure
She took in the Services of ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0044702100:23"/>
Her; and, conſequently, make
Way for their Remove: But as
theſe do not concern Mr. <hi>Harley,</hi> they
ſhall be no otherwiſe mentioned, than
as they ſerved to introduce the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
which followed.</p>
            <p>It was in the Year 1708. when
Mr. <hi>Harley</hi> was diſmiſs'd from the
Office of <hi>Secretary of State;</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Boyle,</hi> now Lord <hi>Carleton,</hi> ſucceeded
him in that Place; a modeſt inoffenſive
Gentleman, and concerned neither
one way or other in the Brigues above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.
And now it was thought
they who had the Adminiſtration
would have gone on in their Buſineſs
without any Interruption, that they
had none to diſturb them, but that he,
who, they pretended, would have
ſupplanted them, being laid aſide, they
were out of Danger; and it may be
ſaid of them, that they were weak
enough to think thus themſelves; but
they ſoon found themſelves deceived,
and that the very Perſons, who had
puſh'd them upon the Breach with
Mr. <hi>Harley,</hi> on pretence of ſupplanting
them with the Queen, were in a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0044702100:24"/>
ſtrong Confederacy or Plot to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
them with the People, and by
the Conſequence thereof with the
Queen; and wanted nothing, but to
remove Mr. <hi>Harley</hi> from them, to
make way for the Execution of their
Deſign, as the Perſon, whoſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
in the Queen, as well as his Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to diſappoint them, they, above
all other, thought to be dangerous to
them.</p>
            <p>It is with the more Reaſon that it
is ſaid, they thought, by the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of ſupplanting the Miniſtry,
they ſhould effectually ſupplant them
with the Queen; becauſe, having
made the Experiment in the Caſe of
Mr. <hi>Harley,</hi> that the Queen might be
prevailed on by their new Method
of treating her Majeſty to part with
Miniſters, tho' She was not diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with them; they concluded they
might take the ſame Method, and
bring her Majeſty to the Neceſſity,
ſo they undutifully called it, of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with others: And that this is
true in Fact, that this was their
View at that Time, is proved by a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0044702100:25"/>
Letter, written by a noble Lord then
in the Miniſtry, who, when their
Plot broke out, had the Weakneſs,
or Want of Decency, to write a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the D—of <hi>R</hi>—into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> wherein he treats her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
and Miniſtry both in the Words
following: <q rend="inline">'I would not have you be
bullied by the Court-Party; for the
Queen her ſelf cannot ſupport that
Faction long.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was ſtrange Language from
a Secretary of State actually in Office,
and eminently diſcovered, that the
Charge publickly laid againſt Mr.
<hi>Harley,</hi> of a Deſign to ſupplant the
Miniſtry, ſhould have been laid on
another Hand, who now publickly
viewed a Deſign, not only of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting
the Miniſtry, who he called
a Faction, but of bringing the
Queen into ſuch a Condition as not
to be able to ſupport them.</p>
            <p>It became ſoon evident, that the
Perſons, who this noble Lord called
a Faction, were no other than the late
Earl of <hi>Godolphin,</hi> and his Grace the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0044702100:26"/>
D—of <hi>M</hi>—. The One at that
Time at the Head of the Army, the
Other of the Treaſury, as by their
farther open Declarations in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the next Parliament appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in which the Juncto to the Whig-Noble-Men,
embarkt in this Deſign,
were called, openly joined with the
male-contented Party, ſo the high
Church were then; nay, even with
the Jacobites againſt the Miniſtry,
villifying and expoſing the ſaid Lord
and Duke, and eſpecially a certain
Dutcheſs, in a Manner far exceeding
all that unjuſtifiable Rudeneſs that
has been made uſe of ſince that Time.</p>
            <p>This however obliged her Majeſty
to concern her ſelf in the matter,
and to let the Juncto ſee, that She
was able to ſupport her Servants, and
that She would not be reduced to the
Neceſſity they boaſted of; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of this was, that they were
effectually diſappointed, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
made no Difficulty to make
their ſeparate Peace with her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
and her Miniſtry. To which
Tranſaction Fame refers us for an
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0044702100:27"/>
eminent Original of abandoning Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> for it was obſervable, that
when they made their own Peace,
they left all their Confederates to the
Diſcretion of the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>But this Matter had another Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
for which Reaſon it is made a
neceſſary Part of this Account, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
that in the interval of this Breach,
much was diſcovered of the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to ſay no worſe of it, of both
Sides; and while they were villifying
one another, to render their Deſigns
black in the View of the People, they
really, as it often happens in leſſer
Caſes, made the Perſons on both
Sides look leſs in the Eſteem of the
World than they did before; there
was much Dirt caſt on both Sides in
the Quarrel, and it cannot be ſaid,
that it was all wiped off in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
nor did the Breach leave
either Side in the ſame Station of her
Majeſty's Eſteem as it found them.</p>
            <p>Her Majeſty was a ſtrict Obſerver
at that Time, of every Article of the
Conduct of either Side; and it made
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0044702100:28"/>
no ſmall Impreſſion on her Mind,
that She found both Sides were to
make a Property of her Authority,
and that She was to be reduced to a
Neceſſity of acting their Meaſures,
which Side ſoever prevailed. From
which juſt Obſervation, tho' her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
ſound it needful to ſupport the
Miniſtry then in her Service, againſt
thoſe who ſo openly affronted her
Adminiſtration as well as her Perſon,
in oppoſing them at that Time; yet
from that Time her Majeſty enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Thoughts of a general Change
in her Meaſures, and reſolved to ſet
her ſelf free as ſoon as might be from
the unhappy Neceſſity, which, it
ſeems, it was ſo eaſie to reduce
her to, (<hi>viz.</hi>) of not being able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
her own Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>This was perfectly agreeable to the
Scheme formerly propoſed by Mr.
<hi>Harley</hi> to the Lord <hi>Godolphin,</hi> and often
explain'd to her Majeſty before that
Time, (<hi>viz.</hi>) to reſtore her Majeſty
to an entire Freedom of acting; that
all her Affairs ſhould be explained to,
and laid before her Majeſty; that She
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0044702100:29"/>
ſhould no more wear the Crown
without the Scepter; that the Doors
ſhould be opened to all Her Subjects,
and a free Acceſs to Her Perſon be
given to all; that Caſes of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
might not come cover'd with
the Repreſentations of the Miniſters;
but every thing be laid fairly before
the <hi>Queen,</hi> that She might act with
open Eyes, ſee for Her ſelf, and give
to, not receive Commands from, Her
Miniſtry. Her Majeſty had, with
ſome Regret, received the former Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of ſome about Her, in the
Caſe of placing or diſplacing of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
and eſpecially that unpleaſant,
uncomely, as well as undutiful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of, <hi>I cannot ſerve Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
unleſs,</hi> &amp;c. and began to be tir'd
with ſome Peoples perſonal Conduct,
whoſe Services were otherwiſe very
acceptable to Her, and their Fidelity
entirely unſuſpected.</p>
            <p>There were two other things which
Her Majeſty could not avoid taking
a particular Notice of in this Breach;
and the future Conduct of theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Perſons make it very much to the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0044702100:30"/>
preſent Purpoſe to mention it here,
<hi>viz.</hi> (1.) That the ſaid <hi>Juncto</hi> made
no Scruple, in order to diſplace the
ſaid Lord and Duke, to bring the
moſt known proſeſs'd <hi>Jacobites,</hi> as
well of the Nobility as of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
as well in <hi>Scotland</hi> as in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
into their Confederacy, and
even to Vote for them in the Election
of the Parliament then chuſing, and
many of them were actually elected
by the Intereſt of the ſaid Whig
<hi>Juncto;</hi> the Names are eaſy to be
given. (2.) That they made no Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of diſplacing the D. of <hi>M</hi>—<hi>h</hi>
from the Command of the Army;
and thought there would be no Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the Confederacy in it at all;
and Her Majeſty was inform'd, that
they went ſo far as to ſound the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> either to ſee how they would
approve of a Change, or to prepare
them not to be ſurpriz'd at it: The
like things having been cenſured in
ſuch rude Terms by the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who then, for their own private
Ends, engag'd in them; Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
could not but call to mind the
Circumſtances, and look on the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0044702100:31"/>
with ſome Reſentment, when
they came to ſpeak of the ſame things
as trayterous, ungrateful, perfidious,
and the like.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and ſuch as theſe, were the
things which pav'd the Way for the
new Turn, which ſoon after happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
in which Mr. <hi>Harley</hi> acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant
to what he had from the firſt
propos'd; laying before Her Majeſty
ſuch Meaſures as were calculated for
quieting, not diſturbing the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration;
not propoſing ſuch Change
of Parties, and ſuch Turnings out of
Perſons, as afterwards happened;
no ſuch thing being in View, till the
Combinations of certain Perſons in
Places, and who acted upon the old
Principle of reducing the <hi>Queen</hi> to
the Neceſſity of acting as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
oblig'd Her Majeſty to do it.</p>
            <p>It is not needful to enter into the
Detail of the Conduct of others;
but this Paſſage cannot be omitted,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the Evening of that Day,
when the <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphin,</hi>
was diſplaced, a general Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0044702100:32"/>
of the Perſons in that Intereſt,
was held at Mr. <hi>B</hi>—Houſe,
where it was laid down as a Maxim,
that the new Managers could no
Way ſupport the Undertaking; that
they could never be able to keep up
the publick Credit, raiſe Money, or
carry on the War; but would ſoon
plunge the <hi>Queen</hi> in ſuch inextricable
Difficulties, as that She would be
forc'd to come back to them; and
therefore it was their Buſineſs, one
and all, to reſolve not to come into
the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Meaſures, in order to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
Her new Miniſters, and ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
Her to diſmiſs them.</p>
            <p>How openly they purſued this
Reſolution, is well known; as alſo
how Mr. <hi>Harley,</hi> now made Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and one of
the Commiſſioners of the <hi>Treaſury,</hi>
ſurmounted all the Difficulties which
they caſt in the Way, ſupply'd the
Money, kept up the Credit, and run
into no Plunges, as was ſuggeſted,
by which they were no leſs ſurprized
than diſappointed; all this is recent
and known.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0044702100:33"/>
It is named here, to ſhew where
began the Miſchief of the Change;
this Meeting of the late Managers
was neither more or leſs than form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves into a Faction againſt
the <hi>Queen,</hi> and Her new Meaſures;
which, though it did not produce
the Neceſſity upon the <hi>Queen</hi> of
changing Her Miniſtry again, as they
expected; yet it did put the new
Managers upon making uſe of other
Hands than they intended; to which
Point of Circumſtance, all that has
ſince happened, may be traced back,
as to its proper and only Original;
for had that Faction not been form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or had they not, when formed,
abſolutely rejected the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Offers
of Accommodation, and of keeping
them in their Places, nothing is more
true, than that all things had gone
on in the uſual Courſe of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration,
by the ſame Methods, to
the ſame Purpoſe, and almoſt by the
ſame Perſons as before. <hi>But Sathan
hindered;</hi> and the Conduct of the
outed Party was very ſingular on
that Occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0044702100:34"/>
It occurr'd to them naturally, that
the Parliament in being would take
ſome Step in their Favour; and that
they ſhould be able to ſpread the
Uneaſineſs much farther, if not
throughout the Kingdom, and it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
as a Foundation of forming a
new Intereſt in their Favour; this
paſs'd a while, and their Friends in
the City falling upon the new Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
with ſome Attempts of another
Nature, it was evident, they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
thoſe Attempts, by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
on their Intereſt in the
Parliament; and ſo open they were
in their Politicks on this Occaſion,
that they were not backward to ſay,
The Parliament would unravel the
new Meaſures, and the <hi>Queen</hi> could
go on no farther than the next Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
The Miniſtry were too vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
not to ſee the Deſign; nor was
Mr. <hi>Harley</hi> ignorant how far they
might probably go to make good
their Threats: This made it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary to diſſolve the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the Inclination of the People
alſo to the Change, now beginning
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0044702100:35"/>
to appear more than it had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and the new Elections appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be generally on the Side of
the Change, the Reſolutions of the
Party mention'd above, began to
waver, their Intereſt ſeparate, and,
in fine, the new Miniſtry, after this,
met with leſs Difficulty and Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in their Affairs, though not
with leſs ill Treatment from particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Perſons, and from the Party in
the City eſpecially, where the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
went too high to be ſpoken
of in a narrow Compaſs, and where
the Meaſures taken to ruin the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Credit were ſuch, though unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful,
as has not been ever pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd
before, and gave Her Majeſty
great Cauſe to reſent them, even on
the whole Party.</p>
            <p>In this Juncture, Mr. <hi>Harley</hi> was
ſnatch'd from the Adminiſtration, by
an unparallell'd Attempt upon his
Life; at firſt it ſurpriz'd every one,
as it began to be thought the Attempt
of the aforeſaid Party, or ſome ſet on
Work by them; but it ſoon appear'd
the ſingle Act of an enrag'd <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0044702100:36"/>
the <hi>Marquiſs de Guiſcard,</hi> made
deſperate by being detected of a
Treaſonable Correſpondence with
<hi>France,</hi> who aſſaſſinated Mr. <hi>Harley</hi>
at the Council Table, ſtabbing him
into the Breaſt with a Penknife, and
repeating the Blow a ſecond Time,
not knowing that the Penknife was
broke, and the Blade left in the
Wound; he gave him a Contuſion
with the Handle by the next Blow,
more dangerous and painful than the
firſt: What mov'd this <hi>Scelerat</hi> to ſuch
an horrid Act, the apprehending him,
wounding him, his Impriſonment, and
Death in the Priſon of <hi>Newgate,</hi> are
needleſs in this Account; being alſo
made publick at that Time by other
Writers.</p>
            <p>None could be blamed for being of
the Opinion, till the Particulars ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
that this Blow was given by
the Procurement of the other Party;
becauſe it ſuited ſo exactly with the
Language given publickly the Perſon
of Mr. <hi>Harley</hi> at that Time, as well in
the City as elſewhere, that it was
confeſs'd by themſelves, the Suſpicion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0044702100:37"/>
was juſt: But the Horror of the Fact
ſo touch'd thoſe, who had a Senſe of
Humanity, that the Generality, even
of the Enemies of the new Miniſtry,
could not refrain expreſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with ſome Warmth againſt it,
and it aſſiſted for ſome time to the
treating him with ſomething leſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency
than before; and not only
ſo, but the Affairs of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
gaining upon the Oppoſers eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Day, the new Meaſures began to
be better reliſh'd among the People
than before.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Recovery of Mr.
<hi>Harley,</hi> and his Conduct in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Affairs having ſatisfy'd Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
that his Qualifications for the
Employment were equal to the
Weight of ſuch an Employ, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
for the <hi>Treaſury</hi> was diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Mr. <hi>Harley</hi> was made Lord
<hi>High Treaſurer</hi> of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> Her
Majeſty doing him the Honour to
give Him the Staff with Her own
Hand, and at the ſame Time to
ſign a Patent, creating him <hi>Earl of
Oxford and Earl Mortimer,</hi> and ſoon
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0044702100:38"/>
after created him alſo <hi>Knight of the
Garter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things are needful to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
becauſe they are the Sum of
all the Advantages which he can be
ſaid to ſhare out for himſelf, having
not, his Enemies being Judges, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated
Honour or Profits, as has
been uſual by Perſons in great Poſts;
and this may be ſaid without Boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that no perſonal Avarice, no ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizing
of his Family, no getting
of Grants, either to himſelf or to
his Family, has been, or with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
can be charged on him; though,
by the Share he enjoy'd of His Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Miſtreſs's Favour, it might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
that he could not want Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
for many things, which
might have been as profitable as the
moſt craving Temper might be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
with.</p>
            <p>The new Parliament being met,
the Lower Houſe appeared enclin'd
dutifully to oblige Her Majeſty, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing conſiſtent with their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
and with the publick Good;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0044702100:39"/>
and the <hi>Queen</hi> never deſiring any
thing of them which ſhock'd their
Affections to their Country's Safety
and Advantage: This mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude
of Principle, created a perfect
Harmony between Her Majeſty and
the Houſe; every thing offered by
the Houſe to Her Majeſty, met with
a gracious Reception and ready
Grant; and every thing laid before
them by the <hi>Queen,</hi> was ſo juſt and
ſo clear, that the Houſe, with an
entire Confidence, came into Her
Majeſty's Meaſures cheerfully, and
with the greateſt Alacrity imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>This
Harmony was a great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment
to the Party, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
the Miniſtry, and was chiefly
owing to the exact Adhering to
ſuch Meaſures in the Adminiſtration,
as could admit no ſubſtantial Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;
for it could not be ſaid,
that the other People were not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant,
to take Hold of every thing
that might have given them any
juſt Advantage. The <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> as
far as he directed any thing, took
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0044702100:40"/>
Care to keep it within the ordinary
Rules of Buſineſs; and, particularly,
knowing what Men he had to do
with, took Care to have every thing
tranſacted in full Council, and to be
duly minuted in the Books. He kept
to the Principle firſt laid down, of
having the <hi>Queen</hi> ſee with Her own
Eyes; and after duly debating things
in Her Preſence, to have every thing
directed by Her Majeſty, with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
of Her own Knowledge, that
Her Majeſty might have no Occaſion
to ſay, as had been too much the
Caſe formerly, that She left things
to ſuch and ſuch Perſons, and had
been ill ſerv'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Treaſurer</hi> likewiſe took eſpecial
Care to have all Buſineſs tranſacted
in the proper Offices, and ſign'd by
the Hands whoſe Province it was;
thereby reſtoring the Adminiſtration
to its natural Courſe, and delivering
the Government from the Grievance
of a <hi>PRIME MINISTER;</hi>
and this is evident now, even to the
Surprize of his Enemies, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuppos'd, that the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0044702100:41"/>
every thing, as had been the
general Belief; and for which all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the Party loaded him with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Aſperſions, find now that he
really managed nothing ſeparately;
and rather employ'd himſelf to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Oeconomy of the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
and ſee the publick Buſineſs
diſtributed into the proper Hands,
and then leaving thoſe Hands to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
their Duty, than interpoſing
his own Authority, or encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Province of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
            <p>Perhaps
this Truth is ſo new, and
the contrary has been ſo generally
received, that it will not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meet with that Credit, that ought
to be expected to a thing ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt;
but when it ſhall appear, that,
in unravelling the Adminiſtration of
thoſe Times, nothing can be found
tranſacted by him, but what was the
particular Duty of his Office, as <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer;</hi>
and that, on the contrary, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Miniſter of State did the Duty
of his Place, and acted to the full
what was his particular Province to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0044702100:42"/>
act; and that conſequently, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
faſten ſuch things upon the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
as it was hoped he might be
charged with. <hi>I ſay,</hi> if this ſhould
not be the Caſe, it will be a full
Confirmation of what is ſaid here,
that he rather directed every Man to
his Duty, than acted in their Province
himſelf. It was his Complaint, during
the Adminiſtration of others, that
they engroſſed the Buſineſs into their
Hands; that the Secretaries and Privy
Council were but Agents, and were
made uſe of for Form only; and
that the <hi>Queen</hi> being ſurrounded by
them, all Acceſs to her Perſon was
cut off; and it was his profeſs'd Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it ſhould be otherwiſe in
his Adminiſtration; and if this is not
made ſufficiently evident to thoſe who
are now ſo narrowly inſpecting his
Conduct, by the Manner in which
they will find all Buſineſs tranſacted,
there is another Proof which will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
to every Underſtanding, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
the Power the other Miniſters of
State, and Men of Intreigue, obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hereby with the Queen; by which
they afterwards took upon them to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0044702100:43"/>
oppoſe his Councils, and at laſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
ſupplanted him.</p>
            <p>If it had been true, that every
thing had been done by him, as it
was unjuſtly ſaid by his Enemies, it
could not have been true, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
was ill approved of by the
Queen, and other Men entruſted, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from him, and who, when he
oppoſed them; appeared to have a
greater Intereſt in her Majeſty than
he had, till at length they obliged
him either to come into their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
which, in regard to the Good
of his Country, he could not comply
with, or to withdraw from them, and
quit the Adminiſtration, which he <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
happily for himſelf</hi> choſe to do.</p>
            <p>In this Conduct conſiſts ſo much
his preſent Safety, that we ſee ſome
of his Enemies very much diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in that they cannot find him in
ſeveral Parts of the Management of
things which they thought were all
his own; and it is ſurpriſing to find
how far this Opinion of his, being the
<hi>Fac Totum</hi> in all the Adminiſtration,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0044702100:44"/>
had prevailed; and the Enemies of the
Treaſurer are under ſome Confuſion,
by their not finding all Buſineſs dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by him. It is manifeſt, that they
had entertained a Notion, that the
Queen was wholly governed by him;
that She did nothing her ſelf, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but by his Direction; which is
ſo evidently untrue, that it appears
her Majeſty not only acted without
him, but even contrary to him, in
many things, till at laſt She was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to enter wholly into the Meaſures
of other Men; and when he could
not be prevailed upon to join in thoſe
Meaſures, thought fit to act quite
without him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This, however unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
will ſhew, that what has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
been ſaid to the Queen her ſelf, is
now confirmed, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
bore the Load of many things
which he had no concern in; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this was evidently one Reaſon
why he drew out of the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of which, and of whoſe Miſtakes,
tho' he did not approve, he was ſure
to bear the Scandal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0044702100:45"/>
It is not to the Purpoſe to enter
here into the Reaſons why the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
rejected the Meaſures propoſed
to him by theſe new Men; whether
they were conſiſtent with the publick
Good, or the Queen's Safety and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
is fitter for them to defend, than
for him to enquire into; it ſuffices to
ſay, they were ſuch as the Treaſurer
thought were not for her Majeſty's
Service, and that therefore he declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the public Affairs, rather than go
on upon thoſe Foundations. It is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
proved by the Circumſtance
of his Diſmiſs alſo, that the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
conſiſted of ſeveral Parts, and
was not engroſſed, <hi>as was ſuggeſted,</hi>
by the Treaſurer, in an arbitrary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
The Diſcontents of other Men
having been carried to ſuch a Length,
as to affront him even in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Office, and to reject all the
Offers of an Accommodation or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
which the Treaſurer fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
made to them, that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
Buſineſs might not be hindred. It
is likewiſe to be obſerved, that in theſe
Offers of Reconciliation, the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0044702100:46"/>
always repreſented the abſolute
Neceſſity there was of having every
Office do its own Buſineſs, and the
Adminiſtration to run in the due
Courſe, according to the ordinary
Adminiſtration, without any ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Superintendency of a prime
Miniſter, or ſo much as claiming any
Reſerve to himſelf; being willing to
confine himſelf to the Sphere of his
Office, with more Strictneſs than any
of them deſired.</p>
            <p>It was not the leaſt Affliction to
the Treaſurer, that he found the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice
of ſome Men in Office, and the
Ambition of others, to be made great
ſooner than ordinary, began early to
offer Obſtructions to the public Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and that he was frequently ill
uſed by thoſe, who, he thought, had
Reaſon to treat him otherwiſe, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
by a certain <abbr>Eſq</abbr> that he was
not made a Peer ſo ſoon as he was
willing to be ſo; as alſo that when
he was honoured with the Peerage,
it was but a Viſcount; and yet more,
that when ſome Garters were diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
he was not gratified: This was
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0044702100:47"/>
the more afflicting, becauſe that
when this Perſon was at firſt, by the
Treaſurer's Intereſt, recommended
to her Majeſty, for the Office which
he was entruſted with, the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
believed he would have acted
from Principles of Zeal for her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Service, and a generous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for the Church and Nation in
all he did, without making his private
Advancement the Sum of his Deſires,
and puſhing that Particular ſo far, as
to inſult his Friends for the Delay,
however neceſſary that Delay would
be to the Queen's Service, who found
it neceſſary to make uſe of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
longer in the Houſe of Commons,
and gave him Aſſurances, at the ſame
time, that the Delay ſhould be no
Detriment to his Rank; ſo that it
only affected his Impatience, not his
Ambition, which was an exceeding
Aggravation of his Miſtake, ſhewing
at what rate he eſteemed his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs's
Service, and the Public Good,
which, to a Miniſter of State, ſhould
always go before his own Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0044702100:48"/>
The Treaſurer failed not, upon all
Occaſions, to repreſent to this Perſon,
and to his Friends, the evil Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of dividing from the <hi>Queen's</hi>
Service, by dividing againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but was always treated with
Diſreſpect, and with much Paſſion.
The neceſſary Concerts in publick
Matters were much hindred by theſe
things, and it was ſcarce poſſible to
go on in the Execution of Matters
determined in the Council to be done,
all Confidence being hereby deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Harmony, neceſſary in
carrying on ſo much Buſineſs, where
ſo much Oppoſition was to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
being thus broken, it is not to
be wondred at, if it gave infinite Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
to thoſe who made that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
of which the Treaſurer fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not in making juſt Repreſentations,
as well to the Perſons themſelves, as
to her Majeſty likewiſe, who often
ſpoke of the ſame with Regret.</p>
            <p>But it was all to no Purpoſe, the
Treaſurer found the Heat encreaſe,
rather than abate; and that it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0044702100:49"/>
bent its Fury at ſuch things
which, altho' they were particular to
the Province of Treaſurer, he had
thought fit to do without communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
his Schemes to him, tho' at
the ſame time they thought fit to
carry on the Negotiations and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
abroad, in many Caſes, without
communicating their Meaſures to him,
and ſometimes hardly to the Queen
herſelf. The Treaſurer has been loth
to mention the mean Reaſons given for
their quarrelling with him about the
Scheme for Payment of the great
Debt the Nation was engaged in,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) that they ſhould have gotten
Money by it; but ſince the ſecret
Committee have thought fit to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
that Part of it, which the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
formerly laid before her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
whereby it is no longer a Secret,
it may ſerve to convince Mankind,
that the diſintereſted Conduct of the
Treaſurer in the Adminiſtration, and
his reſolving to make no private Gain
out of the Ruins of his Country,
was not the leaſt Part of his Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which thoſe Men diſliked, or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0044702100:50"/>
the leaſt Reaſon why they behaved ſo
uneaſily to him.</p>
            <p>But to dwell no longer on this
Part, thoſe who knew the Difficulties
with which the Treaſurer ſtruggled,
in the Matters of Credit, and of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and the Oppoſition the Party,
whom the Queen had diſmiſs'd, made
to every Step that was taken to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
it, could not but wonder that
theſe Men, who, at the ſame Time
confeſs themſelves unequal to the
Work, ſhould not be content to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
no Aſſiſtance to it, but ſhould,
on the contrary, ſo much obſtruct
things, and encourage the Oppoſition
of others, as their Breaches one with
another were known to do.</p>
            <p>The Treaſurer had baffled the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of thoſe who had endeavoured
to prevent his remitting Money to
the Army, and the eſtabliſhing the
Credit of the Publick; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
at his Entrance into the
Office, he found the Exchequer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted,
the Bank refuſing to advance
Money upon ſuch Securities as the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0044702100:51"/>
Government was able to offer, had
the Army at the ſame time in the
Field, which ſome People were not
aſhamed to own, they expected ſhould
mutiny for their Pay, yet he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered
all theſe Difficulties, and gave
good Reaſon to believe that he would
have gone thro' every other Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and it was not a little afflicting
to him, to find his Oppoſers among
thoſe who he had, by his Intereſt
and Recommendation, brought into
Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Yet as things are now like to go,
it is no little Satisfaction to him, that
if there has been any criminal Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations
ſet on Foot, any favouring the
Pretender, any Meaſures entred into,
to the Prejudice of the Succeſſion of
the Houſe of <hi>Hanover,</hi> theſe things
muſt be found among thoſe Parts of
their Conduct which they were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to tranſact by themſelves, and to
which they did not vouchſafe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Treaſurer, as not being ſo
much at that Time in their Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
and as they acted theſe things
by themſelves, ſo they muſt anſwer
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0044702100:52"/>
for them by themſelves, if the preſent
Government think fit to call them to
Account for it, the Treaſurer having
had no Concern in any thing of that
Nature, and is perſuaded that no Man
had the Aſſurance to make an Offer
of any thing of that kind to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and that if they had, that the
<hi>Queen</hi> would have reſented it with the
utmoſt Indignation.</p>
            <p>The Obſtruction theſe things gave
to the publick Adminiſtration, had
divers other Effects; and particularly
it gave Encouragement to the outed
Party, in their vigorous Oppoſition of
all her Majeſty's Meaſures, which
they carried up to ſuch a height, as to
expect the Houſe of Peers would be
brought to their Side; and tho' the
Treaſurer had a firm Satisfaction in
the Peers, that they would not be
impoſed upon in theſe things, yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Numbers appear'd ſomething
equal, and that the Party diſcovered
ſome Aſſurance of carrying their
Point; Her Majeſty reſolving not to
run the Venture, choſe to make a
Number of Lords for ballancing his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0044702100:53"/>
Enemies, a Practice allowed by the
Law, and undoubtedly in the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
however clamoured very
much in the preſent Caſe; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
which, as was evident
by the Sequel, the Treaſurer's Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
appear'd to be founded on a right
Judgment of things, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that they
were ſafe in the Votes of the Peers
who were already in the Houſe, the
Queſtion being carried in the Houſe
by one Voice more than the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of new Lords then created. The
Warmth of thoſe People, who, at this
Time, puſhed at the new Miniſters,
may be judged of by that other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
which attended at this Time,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) That the Occaſional-Bill was
at this Time brought in by them,
which they had always oppoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and which, it ſeems, was now
ſubmitted to, in Favour of the E. of
<hi>N—'s</hi> Scheme, who declared

as the beſt Service he could

were by far, ſo wonderful, as the
Satisfaction with which the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſtood and lookt on while the
Fetters and Mannacles of this new
Law were faſtened upon them; it
cannot be doubted, that ſecret En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
were entered into between

by Parliament, when an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſhould offer: When that Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhall be ſaid to offer, Time muſt
ſhew. All the Uſe which Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
made of theſe things, was to
ſee to what a Length thoſe, who
reſolved to oppoſe her Meaſures,
were come, and what Sacrifices they
would make, to bring about their
Schemes; but theſe things moved
Her not at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0044702100:55"/>
It was far more afflicting to her
Majeſty, to ſee Her Servants claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with one another, in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Her Commands; and to ſee
the Endeavours, uſed by Herſelf, and
thoſe who adhered to Her Pleaſure,
ineffectual to the putting a Stop to
it; yet even theſe Evils, tho' dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to the Adminiſtration, had
their Effect for the bringing about
the great Event which now came on
the Stage, concurring with the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the Whiggs, ſo far as to make
it be ſtill more and more Her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's</hi>
Opinion, that it was abſolutely
neceſſary to put an End to the
War.</p>
            <p>The Treaſurer's Opinion was not
material on the Subject of a Peace,
the <hi>Queen</hi> having declared, that it
was Her firm Reſolution, if poſſible,
to be done upon juſt Conditions, to
put an End to the War; but the
Treaſurer was more convinced of the
Neceſſity, as well as Juſtice of Her
<hi>Majeſty's</hi> ſaid Reſolution, when he ſaw
not only the Warmth wherewith the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0044702100:56"/>
oppoſite Party oppoſed the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi>
even in carrying on the War; but the
Diviſions apparently breaking into
the Adminiſtration, by the Power of
thoſe, who ſet up a new Faction in
the Miniſtry, and by the Influence
they had, not only upon the <hi>Queen,</hi>
but upon the Members of Parliament,
and upon ſome uſeful People in moſt
Offices under her <hi>Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet the Treaſurer took no Steps
in the Affair of the Peace, till the
<hi>French,</hi> having made Propoſals of
Peace to Her Majeſty, it came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him to conſider, whether thoſe
Propoſals were ſuch as might lay a
Foundation for a ſolid Negotiation.
The Treaſurer took nothing from
them otherwiſe than <hi>ad Referendum,</hi>
neither entered into any ſecret Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
without Her <hi>Majeſty's</hi> Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Knowledge: What any other
Perſon might do, being employed or
directed by this new Faction, the
Treaſurer accounts not for, any more
than he does for many of the Orders
and Directions given to the Perſons
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0044702100:57"/>
employed abroad to carry it on, <hi>in
which he had no Concern.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Treaſurer cannot but hope,
that the preſent Enquiry, which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
into theſe things, will ſerve to
his Vindication in that Part, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he ſuffers in the general Scandal
of other Mens actings, as if all things
had been directed by him; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is evident in many other Caſes
beſides that of the Peace, wherein
his Part of the Negotiations ſeemed
rather to be, to ſet to Rights the
Miſtakes made by others; and to
put them in the Way of a regular
Negotiation, after the moſt remiſs
and diſconcerted Conduct had
brought them into Confuſion, as was
many times the Caſe: If the Treaty
ſuffered by thoſe Steps, and if the
<hi>French</hi> were vigilant to make Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the People, who, they found,
acted with leſs Regularity than in a
Caſe of ſuch Conſequence they had
Reaſon to expect; the Treaſurer has
the Satisfaction of ſeeing, that the
Advantages ſo made are the leſs, by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0044702100:58"/>
the Part he acted in that Matter, and
not the more.</p>
            <p>The Truth of what is ſaid of the
Treaſurer not being Maſter of the
Meaſures, by which the ſaid new
Faction then acted, was evident from
their obtaining, without his Conſent
or Knowledge, an Order from Her
<hi>Majeſty,</hi> to pay the Sum of Twenty
Eight Thouſand Thirty Six Pounds
Five Shillings for Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on the
Account of the Expedition to <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da;</hi>
which Sum the Treaſurer ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
to pay, for ſuch Reaſons as are
well known to be juſt, among which,
one was, that he had Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the ſaid Demand was a Fraud,
that the Money was to be applyed to
private Uſe, and that the greateſt
Part, if not all, was not to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the Service for which it
was pretended to be asked; which
Reaſon likewiſe cauſed the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to withdraw himſelf out of that
matter, and to refuſe, for ſome time
before, to meet with thoſe who tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0044702100:59"/>
Neither will it be of any Force to
ſay, that the Breaches did not take
Effect till toward the End of that
Adminiſtration, and that the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
was the ſole Director for the
firſt Three Years, as ſome inſinuate,
to take off the Force of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks;
for it is certain, that tho' the
open Diſcovery of theſe Diviſions,
and their breaking out into a Flame,
did not appear without Doors till
after the Peace was finiſhed; yet the
fatal Influence of them began, even
at the Beginning of the <hi>Miniſtry;</hi>
the Intereſt began to divide in <hi>Feb.</hi>
1710-11, and the Treaſurer refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to meet in ſeveral Congreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of <hi>their Allies;</hi> becauſe he found
them carrying on criminal Intreagues
for the defrauding the Public, and
enriching themſelves by the Spoils of
their Country.</p>
            <p>It would expoſe the new Faction
aforeſaid, ſhould it be made publick,
how they treated the <hi>Treaſurer</hi>
for refuſing to corrupt his Hands,
and ſtain his Integrity, with betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Sovereign to thoſe, who, he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0044702100:60"/>
foreſaw, would betray all to their
voratious Avarice; how he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be forgiven the Omiſſion of
ſuch a Step; and that they would,
by no Means, be thought to have
Juſtice from him, if they were hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
from making a Prey of their
Country.</p>
            <p>It is becauſe he ſtrives not to load
any Man, much leſs thoſe, who, he
fears, have already too much Guilt
to anſwer for, that he forbears to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the detecting thoſe Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
which he then abhorr'd; it is
enough to mention what thoſe Men
too well know the Truth of, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
That from the Beginning he found
their Meaſures too much calculated
for private Advantage, without that
diſintereſted Aim at the publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
which the Duty of Miniſters of
State requir'd; and that, according
to his Duty, he, with Plainneſs and
Sincerity, <hi>told them</hi> his Thoughts of
it, in order to their reforming the
Principle from which they acted;
<hi>told the Queen of it,</hi> in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<hi>Her Majeſty's</hi> being impos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0044702100:61"/>
and being able to do no more,
<hi>withdrew from them</hi> in thoſe things
which he did not approve; as, in
particular, that Affair of the Money
demanded for the Expedition to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In
which Affair, the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> has
the Satisfaction of making it appear,
that he did not come into the Fraud;
and that, notwithſtanding the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of the Perſons, he reſiſted
their Demand of the Money, till ſuch
repeated Orders were ſent him to
comply with it from <hi>Her Majeſty,</hi> as
he had no Power to withſtand; and
likewiſe has had the Satisfaction to
find, that, ſince theſe things, <hi>Her
Majeſty</hi> had an Opportunity to ſee the
Cheat more openly detected by his
Means; and to know, that whatever
was ſuggeſted by the <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> of a
deſign'd Fraud in that Caſe, was
true.</p>
            <p>But what was yet more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
was, that the Perſons concern'd
were not aſham'd to vindicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in this Practice; and to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0044702100:62"/>
that they ought to be allow'd
to do ſuch things; ſignifying alſo
their great Reſentment at the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,</hi>
as if they were wrong'd by
him, in being reſtrain'd from thoſe
things, which no honeſt Man could
allow.</p>
            <p>The Peace having been effectually
ſet on Foot in the Year 1712. met
with unexpected Oppoſition at Home;
and as it was thought that thoſe of
the Allies, who ſeem'd to appear
moſt active againſt it Abroad, were
mov'd to do ſo, by the Impreſſions
which they receiv'd from hence; it
was, by <hi>Her Majeſty</hi>'s Command,
made his Province to ſet on Foot
ſuch Negotiations in ſuch Foreign
Courts as were neceſſary, in order to
undeceive the Princes and States A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
as often as they had receiv'd
ill Impreſſions of <hi>Her Majeſty</hi>'s Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and to ſet Her Meaſures in a
true Light before them, that no Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtructions
might be made of Her
ſincere Deſires to act in Concert
with them, and for their Intereſts;
and, conſequently, no fatal Miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0044702100:63"/>
might happen in, which
might ſeparate the Allies one from
another, which would be a Means
to make the Advantages, which
might be obtain'd by an unanimous
Treaty, either leſs in themſelves, or
difficult to obtain; and it is not to be
wonder'd, if the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
in the Account of theſe
things which he laid before <hi>Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
in the Year 1714. ſay, That,
during the firſt Year of the Peace,
<hi>his Hands were full of negotiating the
Peace in all Courts abroad;</hi> ſeeing the
Conduct of theſe Men, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
they made, made it often dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
as well as troubleſome, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
their Meaſures, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
between what they had
done, and what <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> intended
to have had them do.</p>
            <p>As to what was offer'd at Home
againſt the Negotiations of the Peace,
<hi>Her Majeſty</hi> took little Notice of;
nor did it make any other Impreſſion
on Her, than to convince Her more
and more, of the Neceſſity She was
under of finiſhing the War, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0044702100:64"/>
confirming Her Opinion in the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs
of Her Negotiations. The
Oppoſition made about that Time
to the publick Adminiſtration, as well
of the Treaſury, as of the military
Affairs, gave <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> ſtill leſs
Diſturbance; for the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> having
been ſupported by the needful Funds,
which the Parliament, with great
Duty and Application, diſpatch'd, to
<hi>Her Majeſty</hi>'s Satisfaction, eaſily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
the Difficulties which ſome
endeavour'd to caſt in his Way,
in the procuring Money to carry on
the publick Affairs, and the <hi>Queen</hi>'s
Buſineſs now began to be on a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Foot than ever. The Party,
who, from the Beginning, had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<hi>Her Majeſty</hi>'s Meaſures at
Home, and embarraſs'd them Abroad,
began to loſe Courage, and to give
it over, finding the <hi>Queen</hi> reſolved to
purſue Her juſt Deſigns, and Her
Servants in a Capacity to ſupport
Her Adminiſtration, which they had
been very poſitive, in their Aſſurances
to the Foreign Courts in Alliance
with the <hi>Queen,</hi> could not be brought
to paſs, and on the Miſcarriage
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0044702100:65"/>
whereof, the Sum of their Affair de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.</p>
            <p>As the ſaid Aſſurances to the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Courts had created much Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
to the Miniſters, and had
made the Negotiations very preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;
ſo when the Failure of thoſe
Aſſurances appear'd, as it did very
evident, by the withdrawing of ſome
Perſons from the Kingdom, and by
the Submiſſion of ſeveral active Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at Home, and by the dutiful and
cheerful Concurrence of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then ſitting; in which all the
Difficulties which could be ſtarted
by the malecontent Party, were
clear'd up, to the full Satisfaction of
the ſaid Parliament, who evidently
came into the Peace, and even into
the Manner, or Terms of it: I ſay,
on the Failure of thoſe Aſſurances
given from hence to ſome Foreign
Courts, and ſuch neceſſary Steps as
were taken by the <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
thoſe Courts of the Sincerity of
<hi>Her Majeſty</hi>'s Intentions: Many of
thoſe Courts appear'd ſatisfy'd, and
things went on in a free and open
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0044702100:66"/>
Negotiation abroad for a while, with
more Succeſs, and leſs Difficulty, than
before.</p>
            <p>Yet even in this Part, in which
they could contribute ſo little, did
the Perſons abovementioned give the
publick Affairs all imaginable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
and make the <hi>Treaſurer</hi>'s
Work thereby exceedingly difficult,
by their frequent breaking in upon
Meaſures, acting raſhly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Concert, and perhaps ſometimes
without ſufficient Directions, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
in things of the niceſt Nature;
in which the <hi>Treaſurer</hi>'s Intereſt with
them was ſo ſmall, as that whatever
he could ſay to them on that Head,
was to very little Effect; and for
that Reaſon, as likewiſe becauſe he
was willing to do nothing which
ſhould render Her Majeſty uneaſy,
or obſtruct Her Service, he gave
them as little Obſtruction as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible.</p>
            <p>But
as Men, who agree but ill in
the right Management of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
are likely to agree worſe with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0044702100:67"/>
themſelves; ſo the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
his Hands full with the leſſer
Broils, which they raiſed one among
another; and which, either by their
own Application, or by Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Order, it was often made his
Province to reconcile.</p>
            <p>It would take up much Time to
ſpeak of theſe Matters, and eſpecially
of the Conduct of the <hi>Secretary,</hi> then
Mr. <hi>St. John,</hi> before, at, and after his
having the Dignity of the <hi>Peerage</hi>
granted him by Her Majeſty; in
which many are Witneſſes to the
Treatment the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> receiv'd from
the Paſſion of that Gentleman, and
his Friends; as it relates to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
of his Advancement at firſt, and
his being ill ſatisfy'd with the Degree
of it, when granted: The Particulars
of which, though Her Majeſty's
Conduct was ſo juſt, and ſupported
with ſuch Reaſons, as could not but
be ſubmitted to by all his Friends;
yet were receiv'd by him with ſuch
Reſentment at the <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> as it has
not been uſual for Men of like Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0044702100:68"/>
to meet with, or for Miniſters
of State to give to one another.</p>
            <p>It cannot be doubted, but this
Conduct, as it obſtructed the publick
Affairs on one Hand; ſo it expos'd
them much on the other; leſſen'd the
Eſteem of the Perſons, as well as the
Power of Her Majeſty's Servants,
and brought the Adminiſtration into
Contempt, both at Home and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;
and, which was ſtill worſe,
exceedingly diſturbed Her Majeſty,
divided Her Eſteem this Way or that,
as Her Majeſty found to Day this
Perſon, to Morrow that, acting up
to, or below the Duty of their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
diſtracted the publick Councils,
and oftentimes caus'd Her Majeſty to
ſhift. Her Service out of one Hand,
and into another, which gave much
Diſſatisfaction to the <hi>Queen</hi> in ſeveral
things; and Her Majeſty failed not
oftentimes to ſignify Her Diſpleaſure
at theſe things; which it was much
more eaſy for Her Majeſty to do,
than to find a Remedy for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0044702100:69"/>
This caus'd the <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> after
things were brought to a length not
to be otherwiſe accommodated, and
after he had, in vain, by long Letters,
as well as by frequent ſpeaking to
the other Perſons, preſt them to a
ſtricter and quieter Application to
their Duty, to repreſent theſe things
to Her Majeſty, in the plaineſt and
beſt Terms he could; giving Her
Majeſty an Account of the diſtinct
Circumſtances She then ſtood in,
with reference to the ſaid uneaſy
Perſons; as alſo of the Scituation of
Her Affairs at that Time; and how
Her Adminiſtration then appear'd by
their Management, to be encumber'd
with Difficulties not eaſy to get
through; but yet ending with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
due Remedies for the Evils
which attended it.</p>
            <p>It is true, one of the beſt Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
for the ſaid Evils, had been an
Unanimity of Councils, and adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Servants together
in a ſtrict Friendſhip to one another,
and a mutual Diſcharge of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0044702100:70"/>
to Her Majeſty, that each acting
in their proper Sphere, or particular
Province, with a clear and diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted
View to Her Majeſty's Service,
might go on in a good Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with one another, and a perfect
Harmony of Deſires for the publick
Good, and a juſt Subſervience to
Her Majeſty's Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>To this Purpoſe, the <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> as
well in his Letter to the Lord <hi>Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke,</hi>
as in ſeveral Papers and Schemes
which he gave in by Her Majeſty's
Command, to regulate theſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
always adher'd to the firſt
Opinion which he had profeſs'd in
the Time of the former Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of which mention has
been made, <hi>viz.</hi> That every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
ſhould confine himſelf to
his eſpecial Province, concurring
therein to the general Intereſt of the
Sovereign, and endeavouring always
to lay before Her Majeſty a true
State of Her Affairs, ſhould then act
with Subſervience to Her Commands,
and in Concert with one another, for
Her Intereſt and Service: This the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0044702100:71"/>
               <hi>Treaſurer</hi> always back'd with juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations
of what was the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Province of the Perſon he wrote
to; and not without earneſtly preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
him to enter into juſt Meaſures
for the Diſcharge of the Matters im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
before them, and with
Schemes for the carrying on the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Buſineſs ſo, as to make it eaſy
to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and to themſelves.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of juſt Returns to theſe,
he was continually attack'd with
Quarrels and Complaints, new and
private Schemes of their own; ſome
of which were form'd upon Principles
that he could not, in Duty, comply
with; and upon his rejecting ſuch
Schemes, but eſpecially upon his
prevailing with <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> to enter
ſo far into the redreſſing theſe things,
as to make a Nomination of Officers,
different from their Propoſals, by a
Scheme of the <hi>Treaſurer</hi>'s; upon thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
Step, I ſay, he was treated ever
with Outrage; nor could they be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
brought to any Rules or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
in Concert with the whole
Miniſtry, ever after; till the <hi>Treaſurer,</hi>
to his great Satisfaction, withdraw
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0044702100:72"/>
out of publick Buſineſs, and obtain'd
the Favour of <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd
from an Adminiſtration, in which
he had ſo little Influence, as not to
be able to do his Duty; and yet ſo
great an Unhappineſs, as to be
charged with all the Miſtakes which
other Men made,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Treaſurer</hi> cannot but think
the timely Diſmiſs he receiv'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the laſt Favour his Royal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
liv'd to do him, was the moſt
happy Turn from Heaven that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel
him through the whole Courſe of
his Life, ſeeing it will teſtify for him,
in any Examination which may
hereafter be made into theſe things,
that the Miſtakes which may have
been made in the Time of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
have happen'd rather
from the Want of Power in him to
prevent them, than from his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the governing Influence in the
Miniſtry, as has been ſuggeſted;
that his Part of the Negotiations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
has been rather to rectify
what they had done amiſs, than to
act by himſelf; and that no irregular
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0044702100:73"/>
Steps have been taken by him, no
unwarrantable Practices, no evil
Council given by him; and that his
only Misfortune, next to his having
been ſuppoſed to be the Author of
evil Councils, has been, that he has
not been able to prevent the Effects
of them, or to deliver the <hi>Queen</hi>
from them, whoſe Illneſs, many can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but ſtill believe, receiv'd not a
little Encreaſe from the Trouble theſe
things gave <hi>Her Majeſty,</hi> and the
Grief of ſeeing the irreconcileable
Claſhings of Her Servants.</p>
            <p>But to go back to the Peace: It
ſeems, in all the Speeches about the
Tranſaction of that Affair, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
lie rather againſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
taken to bring it to paſs, than
againſt the Illegality of the Miniſters
being employ'd to bring the War to
an End; which, nevertheleſs, ſeems
to be the previous Queſtion; and
here we find, that the proper En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
was, as to the <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he has acted legally, in obeying
the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Commands, or not? If
any of the Miniſters with, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0044702100:74"/>
his Knowledge and Conſent,
enter'd upon Meaſures, in carrying
on the Treaty, unjuſtifiable by the
Laws of the Land; their ſeparate
Management will, queſtionleſs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
the plainer; and the <hi>Treaſurer,</hi>
when every Man ſhall anſwer
for himſelf, will ſtill be the more
openly vindicated from the Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
mention'd above, of having the
Direction of the whole Affair in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>As
<hi>Her Majeſty</hi> found Reaſons to
reſolve to put an End to the War;
Her Miniſter, whether ther enter'd
into <hi>Her Majeſty</hi>'s Reaſons, or not,
would find themſelves oblig'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into Her Meaſures for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to paſs; whether the Reaſons
which mov'd <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
were Her own, or were
rais'd from the Counſel given to
Her by any Perſon in whom <hi>Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
repos'd ſo much Confidence, as
to be prevail'd with by their Advice;
whether <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> was mov'd by
the Tendency ſo natural to Her, and
the Compaſſion mov'd in Her Breaſt,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0044702100:75"/>
by the Expence of the Blood of Her
People; ſome having ſaid, this was
the firſt and only Motive; but
ſuppoſing it was by the Counſel of
Her Servants from other Motives,
and be thoſe Motives what they will,
it ſeems no Part of the preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the late <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> unleſs there
appear'd ſome Ground for a Charge
upon him, as being the Perſon who
advis'd, counſell'd, or mov'd <hi>Her
Majeſty</hi> to it, or to enter into any
Meaſures with <hi>France</hi> for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
which, on the ſtricteſt View
of all that yet appears in publick,
does not ſeem to be ſo much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to.</p>
            <p>While then it remains unenquir'd
into, who firſt mov'd <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> to
enter into Meaſures for making a
Peace; and the <hi>Queen</hi>'s undoubted
Prerogative empower'd <hi>Her Majeſty</hi>
to enter into, and finiſh Negotiations
to that Purpoſe; It ſeems, that all
the Enquiries into the Correſpondence
between <hi>Her Majeſty</hi>'s firſt Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the ſubſequent Meaſures,
will neceſſarily be plac'd to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0044702100:76"/>
of ſuch Intervention of Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
as caus'd <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> to change
Her Thoughts; and that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
cannot juſtly be charged to bring
to paſs thoſe Reſolutions, and thoſe
Changes, by Way of Intriegue, or
with Deſign to carry on the Treaty
with the more Diſguiſe; this would
be to make the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Servants
guilty of betraying the <hi>Queen</hi> in the
moſt infamous Manner, and expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Honour of <hi>Her Majeſty</hi>'s Word
in a moſt groſs and unjuſtifiable
Manner; and if any ſuch thing
could be prov'd, the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> would
have no other Work before him, than
to publiſh his Deteſtation of ſuch
Practices, and waſh his Hands
of the Guilt.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, it is humbly
conceiv'd, That all ſuch Expreſſions
as are inſiſted on by ſome in the
<hi>Queen</hi>'s Letters, Meſſages, or Speeches,
to the Allies, or their Miniſters,
in which Her Majeſty declar'd Her
Reſolution to carry on the War; to
make no ſeparate Treaty; to procure
juſt Satisfaction to Her Allies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0044702100:77"/>
are to be expounded by the <hi>Grand
Alliance;</hi> and to be built upon the
Suppoſition, That Her Allies acted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to all their Engagements
with <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> in the ſaid Alliance;
otherwiſe <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
to oblige Herſelf to all that
might be contain'd in thoſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
whether Her Allies continu'd
to diſcharge their Part or no; and,
in the Conſequence of ſuch an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
the <hi>Queen</hi> might at length be
alone in the War, under the literal
Obligation of thoſe Letters, Speeches,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it was the Opinion of the
<hi>Queen</hi> at that Time, and of many of
Her Servants, That the Allies, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
the <hi>States</hi> and the <hi>Emperor,</hi>
had not done their Part in the War;
and had not diſcharg'd their Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to <hi>Her Majeſty;</hi> and even the
Parliament themſelves, in the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> to
the <hi>Queen,</hi> (Reference being had
thereto) did confirm that Opinion;
nay, <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> found, that no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
from hence had the deſir'd Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0044702100:78"/>
to oblige the ſaid Powers to
act in another Manner; but were
productive only of Memorials and
Letters, extenuating, or juſtifying
themſelves; and in theſe things are
ſaid more particularly to be form'd
<hi>Her Majeſty</hi>'s firſt Reſolutions.</p>
            <p>Nor was this a Tranſaction of that
Day only; it had been thus before:
And this <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> had long been
acquainted with, in the Time of the
Earl of <hi>Godolphin</hi>'s Adminiſtration,
when, as has been credibly ſaid, his
Lordſhip having frequently preſſed
thoſe Allies to perform the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Grand Alliance;</hi> and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
their <hi>Quota's</hi> and <hi>Contingents,</hi> as by
the ſeveral Conventions and Stipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſubſequent to the ſaid Treaty of
<hi>Grand Alliance,</hi> they were oblig'd to
do; receiv'd for Anſwer more than
once, and that to <hi>Her Majeſty</hi>'s great
Grief; That their <hi>State</hi> was empo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh'd;
that they were able to do
no more; and that unleſs his Lordſhip,
meaning the then <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> would
ſupply the extraordinary Charge,
they could not carry on the War;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0044702100:79"/>
and muſt make their own Peace on
the beſt Conditions they could, or to
this Effect. If theſe things then were
juſtifiable on the Part of any of <hi>Her
Majeſty</hi>'s Allies; they were much more
to be defended on the Part of <hi>Her
Majeſty,</hi> and Her Servants; though
they were led by theſe things in the
Method they were to take with the
ſame Allies, even by a natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe
in the Methods taken
by ſome of the Allies, to reject, and
render ineffectual the Treaty for a
Peace, when it was ſet on Foot at
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht;</hi> and to put an End to it by
the Operations of the Campaign; <hi>Her
Majeſty</hi> thought She ſaw ſo reſolv'd a
Combination, not againſt a Peace
only, but even againſt a Treaty,
without enquiring whether it might
have been concluded to Advantage or
no; which combination <hi>Her Majeſty</hi>
thought was not only inconſiſtent
with, but contrary to, the expreſs
Declaration of the <hi>States,</hi> of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſirous of Peace; that <hi>Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi>
and likewiſe Her Servants, were
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0044702100:80"/>
of Opinion, That <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> was
juſtly diſengag'd from all that had
been ſaid, promiſed, or ſtipulated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them before; and was not at
Liberty only, but bound by the
ſtricteſt of all the Obligations which
a good Prince could be bound by,
to provide for the Safety and Eaſe of
Her own Subjects, by a Peace, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Conjunction with, or ſeparate
from thoſe Allies; in the mean Time,
nevertheleſs, providing as well as
poſſible, for the Satisfaction of all
Her Allies; if they thought fit to
come into Her Meaſures, for their
own, and the general Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>This may appear more eſpecially
from the Inſtructions given to his
Grace the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> when he
went over <hi>General of Her Majeſty</hi>'s
<hi>Forces;</hi> wherein his Grace's Orders
begin thus:</p>
            <p>You are, with all poſſible Diligence, to
repair to the <hi>Hague;</hi> and to acquaint
the <hi>Penſionary,</hi> That, having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
you to command our Army in the
<hi>Netherlands,</hi> we have given you Orders
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0044702100:81"/>
to ſee him before you go to put your
ſelf at the Head of the Troops. You are
to expreſs to him the Reſolution we are
in, of preſſing the War with all poſſible
Vigour, until the Enemy ſhall agree to
ſuch Terms of Peace, as may be ſafe and
honourable for us, and for our Allies.</p>
            <p>You are farther to ſay to this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
That you are prepar'd to live in a
perfect good Correſpondence with all the
Generals of the Allies, and particularly
with thoſe of the <hi>States;</hi> and that you
hope, you ſhall find the ſame Inclination
on their Part, to which his (the <hi>Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>)
good Offices will extremely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute.
You are, after this Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to deſire the <hi>Penſionary</hi> to inform
you what Plan has been agreed upon for
the Operations of the Campaign.</p>
            <p>The Duke, it ſeem, is of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that when his Grace came to the
<hi>Hague,</hi> and, purſuant to theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
communicated the <hi>Queen</hi>'s
Pleaſure, as well to the <hi>Penſionary,</hi> as
to the <hi>Deputies</hi> of the Council of
State, they declin'd him; receiv'd
the Propoſals in a manner leſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
than <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> thought She
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0044702100:82"/>
had Reaſon to expect; and it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
that they refus'd to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
their Meaſure to him, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
him to the Deputies in their
Army; as may be ſeen in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
given to the Publick by his
<hi>Grace,</hi> in his Book, Entitul'd;<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. pag. 2 or 3.</note> 
               <hi>The
Couduct of the Duke of</hi> Ormond.</p>
            <p>This Quotation is needful, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to ſtate the Caſe, as it then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to <hi>Her Majeſty</hi>'s Servants, at
the Time when Propoſals came over
from <hi>M. de Torcy,</hi> in the King of
<hi>France</hi>'s Name, in order to ſet on
Foot a Negotiation for a Peace; and
which, by the <hi>Grand Alliance,</hi> Her
Majeſty was not prohibited receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and, conſequently, the Miniſters
could not be blam'd for receiving it
in <hi>Her Majeſty</hi>'s Name; if, in the
Purſuit of the Negotiations which have
follow'd, they have acted illegally,
that muſt appear upon due Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and muſt lie upon thoſe, who
it can be prov'd, by good Evidence,
were guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0044702100:83"/>
The <hi>Treaſurer</hi>'s Part in theſe things,
can lie only in the general Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) The approving of the
entring upon the Treaty, the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Negotiation not being his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;
except that his Share above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd,
which ſeem'd to be rather
the Neceſſity he found ſometimes to
rectify the Miſtakes which ſome,
by their private Diviſions, and their
other Practices, had run themſelves
into, than that he manag'd any
Part of the Treaty: But the whole
Affair was tranſacted in the Council;
or by the <hi>Secretary of State;</hi> or by the
<hi>Queen</hi> through them both.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it recurs back to what
is obſerved before, That ſuch was the
growing Breach among the <hi>Queen</hi>'s
Servants at this Time, that, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Terms of Peace with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
they were ill qualify'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
one another in the Affair of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Peace abroad; it is hop'd, for
their Sakes, they have made no Slips;
if it ſhould be otherwiſe, their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
will not fail to make their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
thereof. But as to the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0044702100:84"/>
it is evident, that as it was not
his Province to correſpond with the
<hi>Miniſters</hi> abroad; ſo he is not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for thoſe that did.</p>
            <p>It may ſeem ſtrange, that in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on this Account of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of this Miniſter,</hi> who Fame has
ſo often ſpoken of, as at the Head of
all Affairs, it has not yet occurr'd
to ſpeak of the <hi>Pretender,</hi> or ſo much
as once to mention ſuch a Perſon;
but that he ſeems to lie out of the
Queſtion, as much as if there were
no ſuch Perſon in the World; and
this is the more wonderful, becauſe
of the Pains which has been taken
in the World, to load the <hi>Treaſurer</hi>
with the Guilt of this, among the
reſt; and even to aſſure the World,
that this, among other things, would
be prov'd upon him, as clear as the
Sun at Noon Day; notwithſtanding
which, ſome of his Enemies acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
now, that even in all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations
into that Matter, that they
do not ſee, that one Step, in Favour
of the <hi>Pretender,</hi> can be prov'd upon
him; neither do we find yet, that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0044702100:85"/>
thoſe appointed to examine into it,
have charg'd him with any thing of
that kind.</p>
            <p>The moſt which the Examinations
which have been taken of that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſeem to import, amount to no
more than this; That ſome People
in the Miniſtry knew of, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niv'd
at his being permitted to
reſide in the Dominions of the Duke
of <hi>Lorrain:</hi> But all of them grant,
that in all the Negotiations, they
were ſtrictly enjoin'd to inſiſt upon
his being oblig'd to quit the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of <hi>France;</hi> ſo that they do not
pretend to any thing done in the
Treaty in his Favour, or of that
kind, that could be uſeful to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;
nor is it alledg'd, that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
laid on the <hi>French</hi> King, not
any Ways to aid or aſſiſt him, or to
admit his Return, are not as full
and as pungent, as Words could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs;
which Treaty therefore being
ſo calculated to remove the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender</hi>
from the Aſſiſtance of the
<hi>French,</hi> and from his Dominions,
ſeem'd to anſwer all the Ends of the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0044702100:86"/>
moſt fixed and reſolv'd Enemies to
his Intereſt, not valuing whether he
might think fit to go; ſeeing if the
<hi>French</hi> King kept his Word invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably,
his near Reſidence in <hi>Lorrain</hi>
would be of ſmall Advantage to
him; and if otherwiſe, his remoter
Reſidence could have been no more
Obſtruction to him, than the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of a few Days in his Journey,
when he ſhould have been recall'd;
adding withal, that at the remoter
Diſtance of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Venice,</hi> he would,
with much greater Eaſe, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
without Notice, and been
able to have paſs'd <hi>incognito,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he had any Deſign ſo to do,
than he can do where he now is.</p>
            <p>So that on the whole; As in the
Treaty they took effectual Care to
tie up the <hi>French</hi> King, from giving
any Aſſiſtance to the <hi>Pretender,</hi> and
put the Neceſſity upon him, of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
him for ever from his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
the <hi>Queen</hi> ſeem'd to have
done all that was of Movement to be
done; and if any one conniv'd at
the Place of his Reſidence, in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0044702100:87"/>
of his pretending to the Crown
of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> ſuch an one was ſo
far guilty of a trayterous Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
with the <hi>Pretender.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is obſerv'd by ſome, that the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
of the <hi>Pretender</hi> was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of the Abbot <hi>Gautier,</hi> who was
a <hi>French</hi> Miniſter reſiding here dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Negotiations; but it dose not
yet appear, or at leaſt we do not
find, that any thing was tranſacted
for him, but what related to the
Place where he ſhould go; and that
ſo as he might not be ſurpriz'd by
the <hi>Emperor;</hi> and even this ſeems to
have been left undecided; and that
the <hi>Queen</hi> afterwards finding it was
the Occaſion of Uneaſineſs among
Her People, did earneſtly preſs to
have him remov'd; all which can
afford but ſmall Ground to ſuggeſt,
as is done, That the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> had a
reſerv'd Deſign to make him King
of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, however, not at all affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> had not been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in this Place, but to remind
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0044702100:88"/>
the Reader of the Injury the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer</hi>
receiv'd, during the Time of
theſe Negotiations, as well as ſince,
in being openly reflected on, as in
the Intereſt of the <hi>Pretender;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
upon the narroweſt Scrutiny, it
is believ'd it will appear, that not
one Step has been, at any time,
taken by him; or that the leaſt Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of any thing will be found,
that looks like favouring that Perſon's
Intereſt: On the other Hand, it is
apparent, That the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> has all
along been hated and malign'd by
the <hi>Jacobite</hi> Party here, as their
greateſt and moſt dangerous Enemy;
that they openly rejoic'd when he
was diſmiſs'd from the high Station
which he acted in before; and that
as ſoon as the firſt Diviſion among
the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> appear'd, they eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhew'd themſelves againſt the
<hi>Treaſurer,</hi> and in the Intereſt of the
other; which was a Teſtimony of
the beſt kind, <hi>namely, of the Enemy</hi> in
Behalf of the <hi>Treaſurer;</hi> and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that if they had any Hopes of
their Intereſt in any Side, it was in
thoſe who were now oppoſing the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0044702100:89"/>
               <hi>Treaſurer</hi> to the utmoſt: Theſe things,
if any thing will do it, may open
the Eyes of ſome Men, to ſee the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
they have done to the <hi>Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi>
in theſe things; and how inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
he has been all along treated
by them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Treaſurer</hi> ſtanding in this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
with reſpect to the <hi>Miniſtry</hi>
at Home, in cannot be ſuppos'd but
that many things, in the Tranſaction
of the <hi>Peace,</hi> were actually done,
not without his Conſent only, but
that he entirely declin'd to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle
with thoſe things which he
did not approve. It was, no doubt,
the Duty of the <hi>Plenipotentiaries,</hi> to
leave ſuch Articles as they could
not legally adjuſt, to the Parliament
of <hi>Great Britain</hi> to ratify, or reject;
and therefore the VIII and IX Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Treaty of Commerce,
which related to the taking off of
<hi>Duties</hi> on ſeveral <hi>Merchandizes</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
could not be finally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
or otherwiſe ſettled, than
by referring them to the Parliament,
by whom the ſeveral <hi>Duties</hi> being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0044702100:90"/>
to particular Purpoſes, could
alone be taken off: But when theſe
things came to be laid before the
Parliament, it ſeems, it was Subject of
great Complaint againſt the <hi>Treaſurer,</hi>
that he was unwilling, or declin'd to
have the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> eſpouſe the making
thoſe Articles effectual; whereas it was
the <hi>Treaſurer</hi>'s Opinion, That the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry</hi>
ſhould entirely leave the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
to act as they thought fit; and
leave the Houſe to act at the Merchants
Requeſts, and as their own Wiſdome ſhould
direct them; the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> ſtanding
entirely neuter.</p>
            <p>But this likewiſe he was over-rul'd
in; and the reſt of the <hi>Miniſters</hi>
thinking themſelves oblig'd to ſupport
at Home, what they had tranſacted
Abroad, brought in their whole Strength
into the Debate, and, making it a
Party Affair, loſt it in the <hi>Houſe of
Commons,</hi> by that very Means, and
no other: In all which Matter, the
<hi>Treaſurer</hi> remain'd paſſive, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd;
though with this Injuſtice
alſo on him, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſuffer'd
the Reproaches of the Whigs, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſing
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0044702100:91"/>
the <hi>Bill of Commerce;</hi> and
of the other Part of the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> for
not eſpouſing it.</p>
            <p>It would be endleſs to go through
the Detail of theſe particular Caſes,
in which the Province of the <hi>Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi>
was no other, than to bear infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Calumny for thoſe Follies, which
he had no Share in, but had not
Power to prevent; and this made him
frequently ſay, That <hi>he was out of
Office near a Year before he was out of
Place;</hi> and indeed, for ſome of the
laſt Months that he remain'd in the
Place, he had little to do in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Affairs, but to complain of this
injurious Uſage, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to ſee things done that he could
not approve of; and then to hear
them call'd his Doing.</p>
            <p>Under theſe Unhappineſſes he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
an humble Petitioner to <hi>Her
Majeſty,</hi> either to deliver him from
theſe Men, or to diſmiſs him from
the Service: At firſt he prevail'd, to
their great Uneaſineſs, to have a new
Settlement of Great Officers made;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0044702100:92"/>
which, as he knew it overthrew the
Schemes which the other People had
laid; ſo he had Hopes it would, at length,
put the Affairs in a Courſe of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement,
as would retrieve the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
they were at that time in:
This was when <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Duke of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> Lieutenant
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> Lord <hi>Finlater,</hi> to be Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
of <hi>Scotland;</hi> the Earl of <hi>Marr,</hi>
third Secretary of State; Lord <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
Lord Privy Seal; and Mr. <hi>Brom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
Secretary of State, in Lord <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>'s
Room; Sir <hi>William Wyndham,</hi>
Chancellor of the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> to command in chief
in <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to expreſs the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of the other Perſons, who now
own'd they look'd but like a FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTION
in the <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> but gave
out threatning Speeches plentifully,
that they would ſoon deſtroy this
new Scheme: The Trouble likewiſe
which this gave to the <hi>Queen</hi> Herſelf,
cannot be ſpoken of without Grief;
eſpecially when it muſt be remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
how near it was to that fatal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0044702100:93"/>
which remov'd <hi>Her Majeſty</hi>
to a Throne, uncapable of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation
and Diſſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>It was not indeed very long e're
<hi>Her Majeſty</hi> perceiv'd that they
would never ceaſe attacking Her on
theſe Heads, and began ſomething to
yield to their Importunities; which
the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> perceiving, renew'd his
Applications to <hi>Her Majeſty,</hi> to the
ſame Purpoſe as before: And in this
Interval it was, that he receiv'd <hi>Her
Majeſty</hi>'s Command, to lay before Her
a true State of Her Affairs; which
Command he cheerfully obey'd, in
Hopes the doing ſo might either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
<hi>Her Majeſty</hi>'s Reſolutions in the
Model of Adminiſtration lately enter'd
upon, or replace himſelf in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
from Buſineſs, and from the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of other Mens Miſtakes, which he
ſo much deſir'd.</p>
            <p>This Account the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

ſent <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> the following Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;

did him the Honor of granting his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Petition, (<hi>viz.</hi>) of laying the <hi>Staff</hi>
at <hi>Her Majeſty</hi>'s Feet: The Letter as

            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <opener>

                  <p>I Preſume, in Obedience to Your
Royal Commands, to lay before
Your Majeſty a State of Your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.
Though I have very much
contracted it from the Draught I
made, and the Vouchers from
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0044702100:95"/>
whence it is taken; yet I find it
ſwell under my Pen in Tranſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
being willing to put every
Thing before Your Majeſty in the
cleareſt Light my poor Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
can attain to. It was neceſſary
to lay it before Your Majeſty in
the Series of Time, from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to this preſent Time; and
when that is compleatly laid before
You, it remains only for me, to
beg God to direct Your Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>And as to my ſelf, do with me
what You pleaſe; place me either
as a Figure, or a Cypher; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place

Thus ended a troubleſome Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of a few Years; in which the
<hi>Treaſurer</hi> may truly ſay, He enjoy'd
the Place, but never could execute the
Office; and though it is true, that
he had all the Envy, and bore the
Weight of all the evil Conduct of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men; yet nothing can be truer,
than that they not only influenc'd
the publick Affairs, diſtinctly from
him; but that they carry'd every
thing their own Way, even over the
Belly of the <hi>Treaſurer;</hi> and had the
particular Direction of thoſe things,
of which he had the Scandal, for all
their ill Management lies at his Door,
in the Eſteem of his Enemies; and is,
to this Hour, improv'd to his Hurt,
as much as ſome <hi>Men</hi> are able.</p>
            <p>It was, as has been ſaid, but a ſhort
while after this Repreſentation to <hi>Her
Majeſty,</hi> that the <hi>Queen</hi> thought fit to
accept the <hi>Treaſurer</hi>'s Ceſſion of the
<hi>Staff;</hi> a certain Evidence, that their
Influence had a prevailing Force with
<hi>Her Majeſty,</hi> who would never elſe
have conſented to admit ſuch <hi>Men</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0044702100:97"/>
into Her Adminiſtration, who, it had
been prov'd, had defrauded the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
of above 20000 Pounds in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
but juſt before; and who had ſo
evidently been detected in that Fraud
by him, who <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> ſuffer'd to
lay down.</p>
            <p>From hence it is argu'd, That the
Knowledge of theſe things was one
Reaſon, why the <hi>Queen,</hi> after the
<hi>Treaſurer</hi> was actually diſplaced, had
yet ſuch a Prepoſſeſſion againſt thoſe
<hi>Men,</hi> that, to their inexpreſſible <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
Her Majeſty</hi> gave the Office
of <hi>Lord Treaſurer</hi> to his Grace the
Duke of <hi>Shrewsbury;</hi> a Perſon in the
laſt Scheme of the <hi>Treaſurer;</hi> and
therefore hated mortally by the new
Faction, <hi>ſo we muſt ſtill call them;</hi> and
a Perſon, in whoſe Advancement they
were more confounded than before.</p>
            <p>Had the <hi>Queen</hi> immediately entred
into the <hi>Meaſures of thoſe Men,</hi> who
perſwaded Her to diſmiſs the <hi>Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi>
She would certainly have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
receiv'd their Friends into ſuch
Places as they had determin'd for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0044702100:98"/>
them; and then a few <hi>Months</hi> longer
would have diſcover'd what they aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at: The <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> how ill an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
ſoever he had of their Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
had, nevertheleſs, this Hope, That
they would not take any Step in
Favour of the <hi>Pretender;</hi> but always
kept himſelf in Readineſs to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
them in the firſt Steps they
ſhould have made that Way.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Her Majeſty</hi>'s Diſtemper and
Death intervening, ſurpriz'd them all;
put an End to all their projected
Schemes at once; and, among the
reſt, had this one Unhappineſs, that it
prevented the late <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
him of the Opportunity of
convincing <hi>Her Majeſty,</hi> by the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of the fatal Tendency of theſe
Councils; and how naturally they
would embroil Her Affairs, both at
Home and Abroad.</p>
            <p>Upon the preſent Enquiries made
by the Authority of Parliament into
theſe Matters, it ſeems, that ſome of
theſe Men have not Confidence enough
in the Juſtice of their own Meaſures,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0044702100:99"/>
to defend them in a Parliamentary
Manner; but have retir'd, for the
preſent; whether it ſhall be conſtru'd
to ſignify, their pleading guilty to the
Charge, ſhall not be enter'd into
here; but certain it is, that they
muſt know the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> may have
ſomething to ſay to them, which
they are not very well diſpos'd to
hear.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Treaſurer</hi> not doubting the
Juſtice of thoſe, who the Laws of this
Nation have made Judges of theſe
things, <hi>APPEARS,</hi> and manifeſts
thereby his Readineſs to caſt his
Life, his Honour, and his Fortunes,
upon the Honour and Impartiality of
the Peerage of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſſur'd, that nothing ſhall be there
laid upon him, which cannot be fixt
by the Teſtimony of good Witneſſes;
and that he ſhall not be cenſur'd by
their Lordſhips for thoſe Tranſactions,
which have been the Work of other
Hands; and that he ſhall not only
have full Scope given him, for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his Innocence in all the Points
charged againſt him; but likewiſe a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0044702100:100"/>
Liberty to bring to open View, the
Steps which have been taken by his
Enemies, not only towards the Ruin
of their Country; but alſo towards
vindicating themſelves, by laying their
own Crimes at his Door; in which
Defence, no queſtion, not only all
theſe things will be placed in a fuller
and clearer Light; but many other
things be brought into View, which
have hitherto been either concealed,
or very ill underſtood.</p>
