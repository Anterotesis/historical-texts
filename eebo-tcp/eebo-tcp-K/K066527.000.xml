            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE author of the following rhimes, hath too much neglected the muſes, either to deſerve or expect any great reputation as a poet. He hath ever ſet ſo little ſtore, indeed, by his poetical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, as to be now able to procure copies of but few of thoſe, which have occaſionally dropt from his pen. It would be impertinent in him however, to affect to undervalue what he is obtruding on the publick; eſpecially as moſt of the pieces contained in this collection have been frequently printed, and therefore may be preſumed to have met with ſome approbation.</p>

Hence, growing ſturdy and miſchievous,</l>

Grinn'd, chatter'd, laugh'd, and made ſuch faces,</l>

                  <l>Pompoſo fam'd, as rude a bear,</l>
                  <l>As e'er was ſhewn in Southwark fair;</l>

Fluſh'd with ſucceſs, and fond of fame,</l>

                  <l>Certain it is, he made fine ſport</l>

                  <l>Theſe triumphs envious Pug had ſeen,</l>

                  <l>I ſtar'd, as you'll think, all about,</l>
                  <l>To ſee ſuch a wonderful thing;</l>

                  <l>The beavers purchas'd its defence;</l>
                  <l>Or when by chance of war 'twas loſt</l>
                  <l>Redeem'd it always at their coſt;</l>

You hear that as how the painters, and gravers that dine at</l>
               <l>The foundling hoſpital, and called themſelves artiſts, deſign it.</l>
               <l>Now, that we are artiſts as well as they, ſtands upon record in bookery;</l>
               <l>For who of you all hath not read books on the Art of Cookery?</l>
               <l>Nay I myſelf have wrote a volume upon it.— But let that paſs;</l>
               <l>Tho' it was allowed to be as full of 'rudition as Mrs. Glaſſe;</l>
               <l>And, but that I then liv'd well, and thought begging an impropriety,</l>
               <l>I might have had, if I had aſk'd, a premium from the what-do-ye-call-it ſociety.</l>
               <l>For you are to know that I have not had ſo low a breeding,</l>
               <l>But that, tho' a cook-maid, I am had-up <note n="*" place="bottom">Adept.</note> in writing and reading,</l>
               <l>And remember that Mr. Pope, when he tells of lord Timon's feats,</l>
               <l>Joins together the artiſts of pictures, muſick, meats.</l>
               <l>Stand up, therefore, my friends, for the honour of your profeſſion,</l>
               <l>And inſiſt upon making a party in the artiſt's proceſſion.</l>

But, if you are prevented by thoſe nigglers of the pencil and chiſſel,</l>
               <l>Make a proceſſion of your own, and let them go whiſtle;</l>
               <l>At the ſame time give a hint to their cook, who is the ſon of a ſinner,</l>
               <l>If, while they are gone to St. James's, he don't take care to ſpoil their dinner;</l>
               <l>Nay, for the ſlight already put on us, as I hold my pen,</l>
               <l>If ev'ry cook was of my mind, they ſhould never have a good dinner again.</l>
               <l>They pride themſelves mightily on their taſte! to be ſure!</l>
               <l>But, in all matters of taſte, a cook muſt certainly be the greateſt coney-ſewer <note n="*" place="bottom">Connoiſſeur.</note>.</l>
               <l>I like ſuch fellows pretending to have of us no opinion,</l>
               <l>When, I'll be hanged, if any of them know the taſte of a ſhalott from an onion.</l>
               <l>They are ſo vain forſooth, of their paultry raree-ſhow of painting.</l>
               <l>I am ſure, I was ſtarved and ſqueedged <note n="†" place="bottom">Squeezed.</note> there till I was almoſt fainting.</l>

Such ſights may ſerve indeed your ſkinny, ſcraggy people of condition;</l>

               <l>Let theſe upſtarts, however, do as they will, I do ſeriouſly profeſs</l>
               <l>That, as to going to St. James's, I think you can do no leſs.</l>
               <l>For, if what I have heard be true, our calling is aggriev'd:</l>
               <l>And 'tis neceſſary you ſhould do your beſt to get it reliev'd:</l>
               <l>Being told as how that good-eating is going out of faſhion,</l>
               <l>Which is, you know, enough to put any cook in the world into a paſſion.</l>
