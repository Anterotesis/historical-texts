            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Author of this Addreſs is ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſenſible of how little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ſuch writings are to the public, that ſhe would moſt willingly have declined troubling them on this occaſion, were ſhe not impelled to it by two very ſtrong motives; a deſire of vindicating herſelf from ſome of the charges brought againſt the following co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, from the interpolations thrown into one of the principal parts, on the night of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; and the earneſt wiſh of expreſſing the ſincere gratitude ſhe is ſenſible of to the public in general, and to her friends in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, for the generous patronage they have ſhewn towards the publication of this little piece, which with true humility and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhe now ſubmits to their candor and indulgence.</p>
            <p>The author certainly had no reaſon to have apprehended the unlucky event of this comedy, after the very favourable opinion which Mr. Colman, who is undoubtedly a competent judge of dramatic compoſitions, had expreſſed of it,
<pb facs="tcp:0055204000:3"/>
all along, from the time he received it, in July 1770, when he pronounced it
<q>to bid fairer, both for ſame and profit, than any of her theatrical writings,</q>
to the day of its repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, in March laſt, on the morning of which he offered
<q>to underwrite its ſucceſs, for half a crown.</q>
            </p>
            <p>However, ſhe confeſſes that, for ſome time before the exhibition, ſhe had ſufficient cauſe to be alarmed, on account of Mr. Shuter, who had a long and principal part in the comedy, ſeldom attending the rehearſals; and when he did, being found to be extremely imperfect— The author remonſtrated upon this occaſion, and the manager indeed lamented the difficulty along with her, but redreſſed it not.</p>
            <p>At length though late, a day was appointed for the repreſentation, and on that morning Mr. Shuter appeared at rehearſal, pretty much in the ſame ſtate as before, and confeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf incapable of performing his part, that night. Upon which the play was obliged to be further poſtponed, and hand-bills were ſent about at noon, to advertiſe the town of the diſappointment.</p>
            <p>This was a moſt unlucky circumſtance for the author. The curioſity of the public palls upon ſuch delays, and many of her friends, who had waited in London to attend the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, went into the country, concluding, from the uncertainty of the performer, joined
<pb facs="tcp:0055204000:4"/>
to the lateneſs of the ſeaſon, that the comedy could not be exhibited, this year.</p>
            <p>A further and final day was afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined on, but the audience being out of humour at their former diſappointment, called Mr. Shuter to account for it, on his firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; which threw him into ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that he was not able to get the better of it, throughout the whole performance.</p>
            <p>This untoward incident occaſioned two very conſiderable diſadvantages to the piece. In the hurry of his ſpirits the actor not only forgot his part, the deficiency of which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſupply with his own dialect, but alſo ſeemed to loſe all idea of the character he was to perform; and made the Governor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in a light which the author never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that of a mean, ridiculous buffoon. This unlucky failure in the performer, was, by ſome, unfortunately imputed to the writer, and appeared to be a ſufficient reaſon for condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the piece.</p>
            <p>Yet, notwithſtanding theſe almoſt inſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſadvantages, the play was ſuffered to proceed, without any ſort of reprehenſion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the inſtance above-mentioned, and the Epilogue concluding with theſe lines,
<q>
                  <l>The author for your paſſport trembling ſtands,</l>
                  <l>And hopes you'll grant it <hi>under all your hands,</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
received the fulleſt approbation from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, without one ſingle diſſenting voice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0055204000:5"/>Many of her friends immediately quitted the theatre, in perfect aſſurance of the favourable event, and came to wiſh her joy that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy had been ſufficiently ſtrong to ſtruggle thro' ſuch hazardous circumſtances, as before recited. But the pleaſure ſhe received on this occaſion, was extremely tranſient, for ſhe was in a few minutes after informed, that when the play was going to be given out, for the next night, ſome obſcure perſons, in a corner of the gallery, objected to it, who were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by a conſiderable majority in all parts of the houſe; but that after this kind of alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation had been continued, for ſome minutes, the council behind the curtain, taking alarm at an apple being flung from the upper gallery, and ſtriking a branch of one of the chandeliers, thought proper to obey the malicious, who are ever the moſt active, rather than the friendly, part of the audience, and withdrew the play.</p>
            <p>Whether this oppoſition aroſe from ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or ill-temper, cannot be now determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; tho' the latter cauſe is full ſufficient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the effect, as every one knows how dangerous a thing it muſt always be, to ſuffer an audience to be out of humour, at a firſt repreſentation of any dramatic performance; and on this account it would certainly have been prudent to have brought Mr. Shuter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, in ſome of his more perfect cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, between the night of the firſt and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> diſappointment, in order to have palliated
<pb facs="tcp:0055204000:6"/>
the reſentment of the public, ſo as to have prevented any interruption to the performance, on that account, at leaſt.</p>
            <p>By the advice of thoſe friends who were preſent, the author went, that night, to Mr. Colman's houſe, to confer with him upon this unexpected ebb of fortune. He ſeemed to be much affected with it himſelf, expreſſed a friendly concern at her diſappointment, and promiſed to conſult with the reſt of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, upon what compenſation or redreſs it might be reaſonable to make her, upon this occaſion. But the next morning he ſent her a letter to acquaint her, that
<q>all her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects from that quarter muſt be at an end, for that ſhe was to expect nothing farther from the theatre.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The author happened to receive this ſevere ſentence in the midſt of a large circle of her friends, who were then with her, offering their ſervices, for that night, to bring on the comedy again, engaging to prove the poſitive part of the audience ſuperior to the negative one, upon that trial. But this kind and well-intentioned offer ſhe declined.</p>
            <p>She adhered to the ſame moderation, alſo, the next day, when the ſame offer was again repeated, and ſeconded by ſeveral perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unknown to her, but who ſeemed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider hers as a common cauſe againſt oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and declared a full confidence of carrying
<pb facs="tcp:0055204000:7"/>
the point againſt any oppoſition that might be attempted.</p>
            <p>The author does not deny that ſhe felt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and was ſenſible of injuſtice, all the while; but ſhe feared the conſequence of a riot to the manager's property; chooſing to ſuffer an injury, rather than to do one.</p>
            <p>All this temper and conduct was then calmly repreſented to the manager, both by letter, and the interpoſition of friends, but no notice was taken of it. The author confeſſes that ſhe then made a claim of right, to ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, upon the late occaſion, but not till after it had been refuſed her, as a matter of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. She founded her demand, upon the uſage, which is the only law of theatres, and quoted many precedents of the ſame kind; ſome of them in circumſtances too, far more unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the client; but neither <hi>cuſtom,</hi> nor <hi>courteſy,</hi> it ſeems, were to be allowed ſufficient pleas, in her moſt ſingular caſe.</p>
            <p>The author does not mean, by any thing the ſituation of this affair has obliged her to ſay here, to charge Mr. Colman with the leaſt deſign to her injury, by any part of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, throughout. She believes him to have been perfectly ſincere in his profeſſions, and ingenuous in his purpoſes towards her; and has ſeen him mortified and concerned to the laſt degree, at the delays and diſappointments ſhe met with, tho' he did not ſufficiently exert his authority to prevent, or remedy them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0055204000:8"/>The author's friends, upon finding that ſhe would not avail herſelf, in the way they had firſt recommended, adviſed her to publiſh the comedy, by ſubſcription; as well to vindicate her writing from the miſrepreſentation of the night of performance, as to make herſelf ſome ſmall amends for the conſiderable loſs and mortification ſhe had ſuſtained, from its failure.</p>
            <p>This kind propoſal ſhe has moſt gratefully accepted of; and after repeating here her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to the public, and her friends, for the liberal encouragement they have ſhewn her, upon this, and every occaſion, ſhe takes this opportunity alſo of returning her thanks to the other performers in her comedy, who took the pains to be perfect in their ſeveral parts, and ſo well endeavoured to ſupport the ſpirit of their reſpective characters, amidſt the hurry and confuſion which ſo unhappily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the courſe of the performance.</p>
            <p>She now begs leave to make an apology for having preſumed to claim ſo much of the public attention, on a ſubject relative merely to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and with the ſincereſt gratitude has the honour to ſubſcribe herſelf their much obliged, and moſt obedient ſervant,</p>

            <head>PROLOGUE,</head>
            <head>WRITTEN BY MR. COLMAN, And ſpoken by Mrs. BULKLEY.</head>
            <l>BY your leave, critics! To a female play</l>
            <l>A female prologue may prepare the way.</l>
            <l>Among the Chronicles of modern fame</l>
            <l>Who has not read of gentle Frances' name?</l>
            <l>Henry and Frances! a fond tender pair,</l>
            <l>Whoſe ſoft epiſtles ſtill amuſe the fair.</l>
            <l>Some nights ago our couple, all alone,</l>
            <l>A fire-ſide <hi>tête-à-tête</hi>—Darby and Joan—</l>
            <l>Frances, ſaid Henry, give up writing; men,</l>
            <l>And men alone ſhould dare to wield the pen.</l>
            <l>Your ſex of late all decency confounds,</l>
            <l>And breaks 'twixt us and them the modeſt bounds.</l>
            <l>Whether from paſſion, love of pow'r or riches,</l>
            <l>Women, we ſee, all like to wear the breeches.</l>
            <l>At ſea ſome madcaps enter volunteers,</l>
            <l>Some in the army liſt as grenadiers:</l>
            <l>Others write hiſt'ries, ſtate-intrigues unriddle,</l>
            <l>Ride the great horſe, and play upon the fiddle.</l>
            <l>Gently, cries Frances; truce with your reproaches!</l>
            <l>And mark which ſex on t'other moſt encroaches.</l>
            <l>Soft ſilky coxcombs, full of nice punctilio,</l>
            <l>All paſte, pomatum, eſſence, and pulvilio,</l>
            <l>With huge boaupots, like boughpots, daily go,</l>
            <l>Trick'd out like dolls, to pace in Rotten-row.</l>
            <l>Thus flies the morning; and the day to crown,</l>
            <l>To quinze and faro ev'ry fop ſits down.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:0055204000:19"/>Each coat ſo trim, leſt any ſpeck fall on it,</l>
            <l>An apron guards,—each forehead a ſtraw-bonnet;</l>
            <l>Nay leſt rouleaus themſelves ſhould ſoil their ruffles,</l>
            <l>A muffatee each pretty maſter muffles.</l>
            <l>Women in vain to keep their place have ſtriven;</l>
            <l>From ev'ry trade, from each profeſſion driven.</l>
            <l>Men-midwives ſwarm; men mantuas make, make ſtays,</l>
            <l>Dreſs hair, dreſs meat—let women then write plays!</l>
            <l>While narrow prejudice deform'd the age,</l>
            <l>No actreſs play'd, no female trod the ſtage;</l>
            <l>Some ſmooth unrazor'd youth for Juliet rav'd,</l>
            <l>And Kings ſat waiting till the Queen was ſhav'd;</l>
            <l>But woman once brought forward on the ſcene,</l>
            <l>By man, like Eve, was lik'd as ſoon as ſeen.</l>
            <l>Let females then compoſe, as well as play,</l>
            <l>And ſtrive to pleaſe you in the nobleſt way!</l>
            <l>No ſulky critic to the play-houſe drawn,</l>
            <l>Whom modern comedy provokes to yawn,</l>
            <l>But marks of authors paſt the valu'd file,</l>
            <l>And owns Centlivre tempted him to ſmile.</l>
            <l>Why may not Ladies too in future plays,</l>
            <l>Strike <hi>a Bold Stroke,</hi> and, anxious for the bays,</l>
            <l>New <hi>Buſy Bodies</hi> form, new <hi>Wonders</hi> raiſe?</l>
            <l>Thus Frances ſpoke, and bid her dear good night—</l>
            <l>And Henry own'd <hi>his Wife was in the Right.</hi>

                  <p>To be ſure, Ma'am, if you don't chuſe to believe it, I can't undertake to convince your Ladyſhip; but I think the proofs are ſufficiently ſtrong, on my ſide of the queſtion—and if I had ſuch a huſband—</p>

                  <speaker>Mark.</speaker>

                  <p>She was ſitting in the very next room, juſt there at the harpſichord—and ſweetly ſhe does play, to be ſure—I happened to be ſtanding in this very ſpot, ſettling the toilette, Ma'am—I love a little muſic dearly, and I did ſtop to liſten, I own; but without thinking any ſort of harm,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0055204000:23"/>
heaven knows;—for I then took her to be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent as the child unborn—when—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady Sea.</speaker>

                  <p>When, as I was ſaying, Ma'am, in ſteps my Lord; and with the very ſame ſort of bow that he uſed to make to your Ladyſhip—for you know he was courting, at that time—Miſs Melville, ſaid he, I have long languiſhed—yes— <hi>languiſhed</hi> was the word, Ma'am, for an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſpeaking to you, upon a ſubject of the utmoſt importance to my happineſs.</p>

                  <p>What ſubject?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
                  <p>Why that, indeed, he did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſay, Ma'am;—but really, I don't think it ſo very difficult to gueſs. But you ſhall hear, Ma'am—Whereabouts was I? O, where he <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for an opportunity</hi>; but deſpairing to find one, continued he, I have taken the liberty of conveying my ſentiments to you in writing. So ſaying he laid a letter down upon the harpſichord, and I made the beſt of my way out of this room, for fear of being ſeen.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady Sea.</speaker>
                  <p>Grant all this to be true, it does not prove her guilty.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
                  <p>She had no need to bluſh, then, if ſhe was innocent; and I warrant your Ladyſhip that her face was as red as your Morro ſatin, all the while my Lord was talking to her; though it is naturally pure and pale, you know, at any other time. I never was deceived in looks, in my life; and it was by Dolly Sly, the houſemaid's bluſhing, that I found out the affair between her and George the groom, laſt ſummer.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady Sea.</speaker>

                  <p>Why really, Ma'am, it would have been a very indiſcreet thing in me, and contrary to my own intereſt, as well as your Ladyſhip's, to have made miſchief between my Lord and you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you were married. It might have broken off the match, perhaps, and then every ſervant in the houſe would have been a loſer, as well as I, Ma'am. But when once the wedding ſhould be over, and all ſecured, I reſolved to watch her cloſely, and if I ſaw any thing wrong, to acquaint your Ladyſhip with it then, when it could do no harm. But they have been too cunning for us, this trip. For to be ſure and certain, ſhe is now with my Lord, at his houſe in the country.</p>

more than Sir William may be willing to give! Why, he may bid three thouſand, for aught I know.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
                  <p>Not unlikely, Sir, though as yet he has offered but two. But Sir William is a man of ſpirit: and honour, honour, Sir, cannot be bought too dear.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gov.</speaker>
                  <p>Let me tell you, Sir, that honours that are bought, are not very honourable.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
                  <p>Which is exactly the caſe in point, Mr. Nicholas; for if his Excellency was not <hi>worth</hi> the aforeſaid ſum of three thouſand five hundred pounds, he would not have the honour conferred upon him of repreſenting the antient and loyal corporation of Bartertown—Ergol, it is his worth, or what he is worth, which is the ſame thing, that obtains him that honour.</p>

                  <p>I deny your major, and will prove your poſtulatum falſe—</p>

                  <speaker>Gov.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, hey-day, do you think that I ſhall ſit here to hear you diſputing about worth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſuch nonſenſe.</p>

                  <p>Henceforth I am dumb.</p>

                  <speaker>Gov.</speaker>
                  <p>So much the better. Now to the purpoſe, Mr. Squeezem. Suppoſe then that this ſame gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man—Sir William Wealthy, I think you call him—</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
                  <p>Why that, Sir, is his real name and title. His father was Sir John Wealthy, his grandfather Sir Robert, and his great grandfather, who was the firſt Baronet of the family—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gov.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, what the plague, man, have I to do with his father or grandfather.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, Sir, if you are in a paſſion about the matter, there is no harm done. I don't want
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0055204000:40"/>
to perſuade you to be a member of parliament, againſt your inclination; though I muſt needs own that I know no perſon who would make a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter figure in the houſe than your Excellency. Such a preſence, ſuch a ſweet toned voice. I think I hear the people aſk, who is that honourable gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who ſpoke laſt? Governor Anderſon, ſays one. O he's a charming man, and a true patriot, ſays another.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gov.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, ay, Mr. Squeezem, if I do come into the houſe, I ſhall be a true patriot, you may rely on it—I'll get their ſtreets paved, and their lamps lighted for them, I warrant me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
                  <p>Why ſo I have already told them, Sir. Governor Anderſon, ſays I, is as rich as forty Jews, and no more values money than dirt; he'd ſcorn to do a mean thing, for filthy lucre, but will let his caſh fly amongſt ye, like duſt, my boys. For you know, Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they always think him the beſt patriot that ſpends moſt money; and let little Squeezem alone for diſpoſing of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gov.</speaker>
                  <p>That is the very thing I would be at, the laying out my money to the beſt advantage, and therefore, d'ye hear, I would be glad to know, ſuppoſing the worſt ſhould happen, and that Sir William ſhould out-bid me, how much I may be likely to loſe by the diſappointment?</p>

                  <speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
                  <p>That is a calculation intirely out of my way, Sir. But to cut the matter ſhort, Sir, if you will pleaſe to ſign this article, and give me a bill on your ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gov.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, truly, ſtocks are ſo confounded low, at preſent, that I can't bear the thoughts of ſelling

out, to a diſadvantage. But you may paſs your word to them, Mr. Squeezem.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
                  <p>Paſs my word, Governor! Such coin will not paſs current, in that quarter, I aſſure you. Sterling caſh, and nothing elſe will do. But if it is ſo very inconvenient to you to raiſe the money, there are gentlemen enough ready to leap at the offer. There has not been ſo cheap a borough to be ſold, theſe ſeven years, nor won't be, during this ſeſſion, I'll warrant you. Why, Sir, every man of property in the kingdom wants to get into parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, now; and you gentlemen Nabobs have raiſed the price of boroughs, as well as of every other commodity, throughout the nation.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Well, well, ſince it muſt be ſo, we'll ſee what's to be done. I ſhall meet Bull, preſently, and he ſhall carry you a thouſand. That will be two, and I won't go a ſhilling farther, remember, Mr. Squeezem.</p>

                  <speaker>Squeez.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſhall do my beſt, Sir, but two will never do the thing handſomely, I fear.</p>

Why ſhe muſt have three new carriages, at leaſt, for herſelf, when ſhe is married, beſides a moſt ſuperb palanquin, for his Excellency, ſuch as your Nabobs uſe; and ſhe has promiſed to buy me a tim-whiſkey, for myſelf; and I have ever found her as good as her word— ſhe is not one of your court promiſers, I aſſure you.</p>

                  <p>Dear Madam, he is gone, and my Miſtreſs out too; but if he were with her, a thouſand times, I dare not do ſo. Mr. Bull, to be ſure, is a very rich man, but a very penurious one, and might perhaps diſinherit his niece, if he knew that ſhe ventured to run a ſhilling in debt.</p>

Eh, Mrs. Lucy, and may I depend on her dealing with me, afterwards? for I have been fobbed off, in that way, before now. When the quality get ſo far in our debt, that they don't chooſe to pay, they often quit us, and then do as much for ſome other of the trade.</p>

Unhappy Maria! how ſincerely do I pity her
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0055204000:57"/>
ſituation! yet let me hope that indiſcretions rather than vice, have miſled her ſteps from the ſole paths of happineſs and peace. But do they not, alas! in our ſex, almoſt equally involve their wretched victims in miſery, and lead them on to ruin! Were it poſſible for me to awaken her to a ſenſe of her danger, I ſhould then have moſt amply repaid her civilities to me, by an act of the moſt real kindneſs and friendſhip.

What can this particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation mean? There ſeems to be ſomething odd in this buſineſs, Colonel. Perhaps her Ladyſhip deſigns to raiſe my jealouſy. I have heard of ſuch arts put in practice upon lukewarm huſbands, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>She has gone one ſtep towards it, my Lord, at leaſt, by raiſing your curioſity. But where our affections are not much intereſted, I ſhould think it unnatural for any ſuch paſſion to be moved.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Sea.</speaker>
                  <p>You'll pardon me, Colonel, for though I am not romantically in love with my wife, I could perhaps be as outrageouſly jealous of her honour, on the leaſt alarm, as the moſt amorous coxcomb breathing. But to do her juſtice, her conduct through life has been ſo irreproachable, that I dare ſay her ſenſe and virtue will never ſuffer her to render me uneaſy; that way, at leaſt.</p>

                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſhould be better pleaſed at hearing you make your wife's encomium, if it did not ſo ſtrongly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0055204000:60"/>
reflect upon yourſelf, my Lord. How is it poſſible that you can allow her thoſe merits which are to be the baſis of your ſecurity and peace, and yet withhold from her the juſt reward of them, your tenderneſs and eſteem?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Sea.</speaker>
                  <p>Do not preſs me upon this ſubject, Ramſay, for even to you I cannot unfold the ſecret of my heart; but will ſo far confeſs to you that I have acted, and ſtill continue to do ſo, againſt the fulleſt conviction both of my honour and reaſon. But perhaps if I could happen to diſcover a few failings in my wife's character, her preſence would be leſs uneaſy to me; for, in ſhort, Charles, we cannot love any one cordially, who conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches us, though ever ſo ſilently.</p>

                  <p>What a perverſe fate is Lady Seaton doomed to, whoſe very merits are imputed to her as faults! but I hope, for your own ſake, as well as hers, that this delirium will ſoon have an end; for no rational perſon can ever taſte of happineſs, who is conſcious of purſuing it by improper means.</p>

                  <p>What I know already, my Lord, that paſſion is often too ſtrong for reaſon; and while Mrs. Frankly's charms retain their dominion over your heart, you will continue ſtill blind and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to thoſe of Lady Seaton.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>You are miſtaken, Colonel, my heart is no way concerned, in my attachment to Mrs. Frankly—for though ſhe is handſome, lively, and, as far as I can judge, has nothing of the prude about her, ſhe can only amuſe, but not infatuate; and 'tis merely in hopes of triumphing over a more ſerious paſſion, that I ſometimes trifle away an hour or two with her.</p>

But then ſhould ſhe reveal the cauſe of her quitting this houſe, will not Ramſay think I have acted unworthily? But of what conſequence are his thoughts, to the ſecret upbraidings of my own! Could I but recal a few ſhort weeks, I ſhould be happy, becauſe I ſhould be blameleſs. But that indiſſoluble knot, which has rendered an amiable woman as wretched as myſelf, can never be untied. Then hang reflection, ſucceſs to diſſipation, and now for a little flirt with my lively widow, for the reſt of the evening.

               <p>You are upon the wing, I find, Miſs Melville; I ſhall be vaſtly dull without you. But before you ſet out, pray let me a little, into your preſent ſcheme; and firſt tell me about what age may your friend Mrs. Freeman be?

                  <p>How wildly you talk, Maria. Mrs. Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is in the prime of life, and likely, I hope, to live long. She has been a widow about five years, and though univerſally admired, has choſen to paſs the greateſt part of that time, at her ſeat in Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire, amidſt her own and her late huſband's friends and neighbours.

Why, if the Governor ſhould marry her to-morrow, 'tis ten to one but ſhe'd be in the heighth of the mode in a week; in Doctor's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in a fortnight; and a beggar before the honey-moon was over.

                  <p>MY ſearch has hitherto been vain; but I have juſt now heard that my ſiſter Freeman is expected ſoon in town; and if female friendſhips are not, as Lord Seaton ſays, an empty name, ſhe will probably know ſomething of my dear Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte's ſituation or abode. My engagement here, for this evening, puts it out of my power to enquire about her, to-night; but to morrow early I ſhall call at her houſe—Mrs. Markam!</p>

                  <p>You are welcome to England, Sir, but am ſorry to acquaint you that my Lady happens to be ſo much indiſpoſed, at preſent, that ſhe muſt deny herſelf the pleaſure of ſeeing you, for this evening.</p>

                  <p>O, by no means ſudden, Sir. My Lady has been ill of the ſame diſorder, ever ſince ſhe has been married. I wonder, for my part, how ſhe has been able to bear it ſo patiently; but ſhe is convinced, at laſt, and I hope ſhe'll pluck up a

                  <p>Well, Sir, and if ſhe was, ſhe has had enough in conſcience to have made her ſick, ſince then. She'll believe me, another time, I fancy. I am not apt to be miſtaken, whatever ſhe may be. I am ſure it is a ſcandalous thing for him that has ſuch a charming Lady of his own, and has not been married quite two months yet—And that pretty demure Miſs too, that my Lady was ſo fond of—But I never liked her, for my part, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſaid that ſmooth water—</p>

                  <speaker>Mark.</speaker>
                  <p>I beg your honour's pardon—I forgot that you were in love with Miſs Melville formerly, or to be ſure I would not have ſaid a word againſt her before you; but then I was ſo enraged with my Lord for ſlighting his good Lady, that I could not command myſelf—Though for certain it is no affair of mine, after all; and I muſt beg, Sir, that you would not mention any thing I have ſaid, for the world; for my Lady would never forgive me, if ſhe knew that I ſpoke of it to any one.</p>

                  <p>I am on the rack.
<stage>(Aſide.)</stage>
The only way then to inſure my ſecrecy, Mrs. Markam, is by making me a thorough confidant; for as yet I do not comprehend what Miſs Melville has to do with either your Lady's illneſs, or your Lord's unkindneſs. She quitted this houſe, I have been informed, before they were married; and they have both aſſured me they have neither of them ſeen her, ſince.</p>

Deſpicable, yet unhappy woman! The artful mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her conduct, this evening, has ſunk her below my pity.

Though I cannot account for her follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to Mrs. Frankly's this evening.

After ſome unſucceſsful ſtruggles with myſelf, I at length determined to confeſs my prepoſſeſſion for Miſs Melville, and break off the treaty with you— I wrote to her, accordingly, on the ſubject—Her anſwer was conſiſtent with that worth which dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies her whole conduct. She owned ingenuouſly that her heart had been preingaged, but alſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly aſſured me, that were it perfectly free, ſhe could never have availed herſelf of my preference in her favour, to your prejudice.</p>

                  <p>I have reaſon to believe that ſhe left this houſe, in hopes her abſence might efface my paſſion, and ſuffer your beauty and merits, Madam, to produce the effect they muſt naturally have had upon a diſengaged heart. From that moment, till this evening, and that by accident merely, I declare I never ſaw or heard from her; and was, at that inſtant, only intreating her return to you again.

                  <p>Why my good friend, honeſt Sam.

                  <p>I ſhall not attempt to anſwer you, indeed, Sir, as you really appear to be quite out of your reaſon, at preſent, and there is no arguing with a madman.</p>

                  <p>If I am mad, 'tis you that have made me ſo—but your inſolence ſhall not defend you. I will expoſe you and <hi>your good uncle Bull,</hi> to the whole world. I won't confine myſelf to one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it—all India ſhall know how you have uſed me. Where are the ear-rings I gave you?

                  <p>How is that poſſible, pray, if I have already given them to Mr. Bull?—Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gov.</speaker>
                  <p>Her aſſurance amazes me—I thought ſhe would have fallen at my feet and implored my pardon.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Frank.</speaker>
                  <p>No, really, Sir—injured inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence has a right to reſent—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gov.</speaker>
                  <p>Injured innocence!—that word has almoſt choked me—This is too much—Then, Madam <hi>Injured Innocence,</hi> I have accuſed you wrongfully, it ſeems—</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Frank.</speaker>
                  <p>So you may poſſibly find, Sir, when perhaps it may be too late to repent of it.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Frank.</speaker>
                  <p>Then firſt, Sir, give me leave to aſk you if you are acquainted with the reaſon of Lucy's quitting my ſervice?</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Frank.</speaker>
                  <p>Juſt the reverſe, Sir—I turned her out of my houſe, laſt night, for abuſing you, ungenerous as you are.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Frank.</speaker>
                  <p>How can you think, ſaid ſhe, of burying your youth, beauty, and fortune, in the arms of your grandfather! when there are ſo many—</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gov.</speaker>
                  <p>Grandfather! confound the jade.—Let me hear no more of her impertinence, but come to the point, Madam; Where is <hi>your uncle,</hi> and where are my diamonds, d'ye ſee?</p>

                  <p>Mr. Bull, Sir, is gone into Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, to bring up a witneſs to prove my dear Mr. Frankly's laſt will—and as to the diamonds, Sir,

Lucy, you ſay, has given you a full account of them.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Gov.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, yes, and a receipt in full, too, Madam—your pretended uncle has carried them into Wiltſhire to bribe your evidence, I ſuppoſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Frank.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. Bull has them, then! mighty well, Sir. And if I was to produce them now, what would you ſay, then, Sir?</p>

               <sp>

<stage>
                        <hi>(opening a caſket. He ſtarts.</hi>)</stage>—
Now take them back again, Sir, for as I prized them more as a token, than a gift, they have loſt their value with your unkindneſs.

                  <p>I am confounded! I am dead! the very jewels I gave her, that's certain! That vile jade Lucy! I ſee you are innocent, Madam, and muſt implore your pardon for having doubted it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Frank.</speaker>
                  <p>You ought not to have doubted it, Sir, nor have ventured to inſult a woman of honour upon the teſtimony of a wretch, whom common ſenſe might have informed you I ſhould not have diſcarded, had it been in her power to have hurt me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gov.</speaker>
                  <p>Why to be ſure I might have thought of that, Madam, but you can't conceive what a pack of plauſible lies ſhe told me.—She ſaid you were in love too with Lord Seaton, who deſpiſed you— nay his Lordſhip ſpoke to your diſadvantage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, alſo, and firſt cautioned me againſt marrying you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Frank.</speaker>
                  <p>But ſurely now any perſon of common ſenſe, Sir, would have conſidered his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prevent it, as a proof rather of love,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0055204000:96"/>
than of hate—I ſoon perceived he had gained Lucy over to his intereſt, which was the chief reaſon of my diſcharging her; in revenge for which ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all thoſe abominable ſtories, and you were weak enough to believe them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gov.</speaker>
                  <p>I have been weak enough, to be ſure; but you ſhall find now that I am perfectly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Frank.</speaker>
                  <p>You allow then, that you have been in the wrong, Sir—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gov.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Gov.</speaker>
                  <p>Shamefully—I ſee it, now—I feel it— Yes, yes, I have been duped, indeed, with a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Frank.</speaker>
                  <p>And you really do repent of your credulity.</p>

                  <p>Well, well, then, I do forgive you, Sir.</p>

                  <p>And I aſk your pardon, again and again —So now let us kiſs and friends—kiſs and friends, for life, d'ye ſee. I ſhall think every minute an age 'till we are one—we'll be married, this very day. Let's loſe no time, d'ye ſee. I'll ſtep home and bring Nicholas, directly, to give you away, and do you run in and prepare, ſo that there may be no waiting when we call on you.</p>

                  <p>You treſpaſs on my fondneſs, which pleads your cauſe ſo ſtrongly; for had you leſs love, you would have had leſs jealouſy; and the exceſs of one ſhould ever atone for the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I ſhall burſt with rage.— There never was ſuch a villainous proceeding. A raſcally coachmaker, a varniſhing Scoundrel, I think that's his name, my Lord, threatens to arreſt me for a debt I never contracted, becauſe the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thought I had been married, this morning, d'ye ſee.—It would have been a pretty ſort of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, truly, to have happened on one's wedding-day.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Sea.</speaker>
                  <p>I apprehend, Governor, that this would not have been the only circumſtance of the kind you would have had to celebrate your nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, if you had married that lady.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Gov.</speaker>
                  <p>No, no, I did not fight Gentoos, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rattoes, Seapoys, and climates, d'ye ſee, to be bamboozled out of my money, at home.</p>

                  <p>No, Sir, that debt I ſhall take upon myſelf, with pleaſure, for the happineſs I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, through Mrs. Frankly's means, of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eſteeming Lady Seaton as I ought. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a woman in diſtreſs, however incurred, is always intitled to the compaſſion and protection of a man of honour.</p>

                  <p>Nay, for that matter, my Lord, let me have but a little of my own way, d'ye ſee, and I can be as liberal as the beſt of you. I am paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, but not ſevere; and ſo I forgive the injury, and ſhall diſcharge that debt; for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks a man's mind and his means muſt be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably poor, indeed, who cannot afford to give, and forgive, too—</p>

                  <p>His taſtes and manners may be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, perhaps, Colonel, but his good-nature and generoſity are true Engliſh ſtaple. A Briton need never go a trafficking for principles.</p>

                  <p>Well, take me as I am—I have bought ſome wiſdom for myſelf, at preſent, for I ſhall not ſo readily believe that the women are in love with me, now, as they might have been, ſome thirty years ago.

            <l>Blown up and ruin'd here—'tis a ſtrange notion,</l>
            <l>You'll ſay, but I'm reſolv'd to croſs the ocean;</l>
            <l>I'll e'en equip me for the Indian route;</l>
            <l>Seaton and Ramſay join to fit me out:</l>

            <l>Even this homely face would charm, they ſay,</l>

            <l>And ſhe who in a croud would ſcarcely paſs</l>
            <l>With us, would be a Venus, at Madraſs.</l>
            <l>Pantheon, Opera, Playhouſe, Fantoccini,</l>
            <l>Farewel—I'll go, and be a Nabobini:</l>
            <l>Or, if that ſcheme, perchance, ſhould not ſucceed,</l>
            <l>E'en wed a Seapoy chief, and mend the breed.</l>
            <l>What if one's huſband is a little frightful,</l>
            <l>Where every thing beſides is ſo delightful.</l>
            <l>'Twill be ſo charming, on a ſummer's day,</l>
