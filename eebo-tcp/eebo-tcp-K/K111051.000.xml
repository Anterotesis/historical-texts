         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>I. ELECTRICAL AETHER! OR, AN AGGREGATE COMPOUND OF THE MOST ACTIVE FACULTIES OF THE MATERIAL SOUL OF THE UNIVERSE.</head>
               <p>THIS admirable Compoſition is one of the pureſt and moſt ſubtil eſſences in nature. It is a combination, or concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of all her elementary powers, and vivifying influences: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eſſence extracted by air, magnetiſm, and the electrical or celeſtial fire, from the richeſt oriental aromatics, &amp;c. with the balmieſt and moſt active aether. A few of the richeſt, mildeſt, and moſt cordial roots, barks, ſeeds, flowers, fruits, gums and balſams, which flow into this great metropolis from the four quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the globe, eſpecially thoſe from Aſia, and the choiceſt of the Britiſh ſimples, are under my own immediate inſpection ſelected, properly prepared, and put into maſſy glaſs veſſels, and upon them is poured a due quantity of the fineſt aetherial ſpirit. They are then placed in one of the great metallic globes on the dome of the electrical Temples of Health and of Hymen, in the Apollo and other apartments of thoſe GREAT and moſt uſeful Inſtitutions, to be acted upon by the celeſtial fire, &amp;c. and laſtly, the eſſence is purified by filtration upon a new principle, which prevents all poſſibility of the fineſt and moſt volatile parts evaporating.</p>
               <p>The globes are entirely lined with metal in the in—as well as on the outſide. They are twelve in number, each containing full thirty-ſix gallons. The glaſs veſſels too, are covered with metal, incloſed in curious magnetic caſes, and their ſtoppers are pierced with glaſs tubes and thick metal rods, which end in a multitude of points, from which ſtreams of the electrical fire, &amp;c.—are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually pouring in upon the aether and aromatics, in luminous and moſt glorious ſtreams.</p>
               <p>The immenſe quantity of this vivifying reſtorative fire, &amp;c. which is accumulated in theſe Temples, flows thus into the medicines through the rods and tubes above-mentioned, which with the magnetic efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium paſſes even through the outſide of the glaſſes, &amp;c. to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances contained in them: for each of the four great globes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0619400100:3"/>a genial, <hi>cool</hi> OVEN, glowing with the plenitude of theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary, vital, and harmonious influences.</p>
               <p>By this curious and moſt wonderful proceſs, like every operation which I perform on my patients, with this, or with any other part of my aſtoniſhing and tremendous apparatus, (which, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in both the Temples, occupies in fact twenty rooms) I have it in abſolute command and ſubjection acting arbitrarily or at pleaſure on the medicines,—on my patients—or on any part of their body or limbs particularly affected, in any quantity, or with any degree of power, according to the nature of the ſubſtances, or as the various conſtitutions, &amp;c.—of my patients require: in ſhort, the whole of the apparatus employed in making the three Great Medicines men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this Deſcription, if ſolid metal, would weigh conſiderably above ſeven hundred thouſand pounds. After the above account of the compoſition and preparation of the electrical aether, it would be quite unneceſſary for me to dwell on its manifold and ſurprizing virtues. Philoſophers, phyſicians and chemiſts muſt plainly ſee, that by the above means, a rich, yet SIMPLE <hi>homogene,</hi> and VI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIFYING QUINTESSENCE muſt be produced,—an utter enemy to diſeaſes and corruption,—and a cordial peace-maker in all ſtrife and diſcord in the human body! Theſe facts muſt be too obvious to <hi>every</hi> perſon of even a very common underſtanding, to require commenting upon. I ſhall juſt ſay that for preventing every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of infection, and for curing all low, nervous, lingering and putrid diſeaſes, nothing on earth can equal this moſt noble quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence which I chuſe to call, ſimply,—<hi>Electrical Aether;</hi> and as it is much eaſier and wiſer to prevent diſeaſes, than to cure them, I ſhall point out, very briefly, its uſes in the firſt place as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then, all perſons who frequent public places, and who regard their health, ought never to be without a vial of the electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal aether, even in their pocket—thoſe eſpecially who are ſubject to catch colds and dangerous diſorders,—or who have weakneſs and oppreſſions at their breaſt and ſtomach,—or a nervous ſyſtem irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and relaxed.</p>
               <p>It is well known, by every perſon who knows any thing at all of medicine or philoſophy, that the air of any place after it has been breathed, and charged with the phlogiſticated or mephitic breath, perſpiration, &amp;c. of even the cleaneſt, ſoundeſt and healthieſt perſons, —becomes not only altogether unfit for reſpiration, but likewiſe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utely and highly poiſonous. But how much more dangerous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome muſt it be, to draw into our lungs, perhaps for ſeveral hours together, the foul and putrid exhalations which reek from the dirty bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and garments—ſecret ſores—and corrupted lungs crammed up in places of public amuſement!—I am not at all ſurprized at the ſevere diſeaſes and ſudden deaths which happen among both young and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0619400100:4"/>old. No; but I am aſtoniſhed that MANY MORE do not happen; and that ſo many rational beings ſhould ſubmit to the drudgery and danger, not to mention the expence, of attending crouded —nonſenſical—public places. But as it is in vain to oppoſe the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannic force of faſhion, or to ſhake off the mighty influence of HABIT, which, with abſolute ſway govern every thing that hath the breath of life, I would adviſe every prudent perſon before they go into ſuch places to fortify their body, and harmonize their mind, with taking a tea ſpoonful of the electrical aether, or nervous aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial balſam on ſugar, or in any thing they like beſt—and even to ſmell now and then to the former in ſuch places when they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect danger, or when they find themſelves languid or oppreſſed. —By theſe precautions, many hundreds of the nobility and gentry in Europe, experience daily from it the happieſt effects; and when they return home faint, relaxed and exhauſted, from over heated rooms, public or private; from enervating indulgencies too, <hi>(in ſacrificing to Venus or Bacchus)</hi> or from violent agitations of body and of mind—they are preſently refreſhed, recruited, compoſed, and invigorated by ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the electrical aether for a few minutes, by taking a tea ſpoonful or two of IT, (OR RATHER, of the nervous aetherial balſam) in a glaſs of brandy,—of wine,—or of cold water:—or even by pouring a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the electrical aether into a baſon or quart mug half filled with hot water, coffee, green tea, or an infuſion of aromatic Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh herbs, flowers, &amp;c. and breathing over it for a few minutes. By theſe means, under God! ſweet, ſound, and refreſhing ſleep, and mental tranquility, are with certainty procured,—and all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of diſeaſe or decay, effectually warded off:—and theſe happy effects are rendered ſtill more certain, kindly and laſting, if the perſons will waſh or bathe their face, neck, hands, feet, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate parts—ESPECIALLY THE LATTER, with pure COLD water—or with milk and water—about blood warm. This ſimple and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful affair of bathing the private parts and fundament every night and morning, ſummer and winter, in ſickneſs and in health, in cold milk or water—is of more importance to the bodily health, youthful beauty, and ſweet deſireableneſs of men and WOMEN, than any thing I can poſſibly mention or inculcate. If this moſt ſalutary practice of applying even partially, cold or at moſt tepid water or milk, to the ſurface of the body and limbs,—if ſimplicity, modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, regularity and temperance, in the indulgence of every appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and in the gratification of every deſire—in a word, if prudence, wiſdom, delicacy, virtue, and that genuine religion which flows warm and ſilent in an everlaſting and ſupremely cordial circulation, between THE PERFECTION OF EVERY EXCELLENCE— THE ETERNAL SOURCE OF LIFE, LOVE, LIGHT AND HAPPINESS!—and the benevolent—the melting—the enlarged human breaſt!—If this ſterling—this all-bleſſing religion which knows no diſtinction of ſect, church, age or country—
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0619400100:5"/>and whoſe ſignet of divinity is liberty, forbearance and univerſal love! — if theſe, with their white-robed attendants who came down from heaven and who will conduct us thither—namely, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, Activity, and Peace—were permitted to direct and controul our thoughts, words and actions daily, from our birth to the laſt day of life—the image of God which he ſtampt on mankind at their original creation would be in a great meaſure recovered and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved—we ſhould continue very long and very happily in this tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent—probationary ſtate of exiſtence—a hundred years ſeeming but as one ſummer's day, while with a gradual deſcent, we would glide gently and ſweetly down the hill of life, under the ſerene and lucid influence of its evening ſky.</p>
               <p>Behold, here, in a few words, my courteous and intelligent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, a complete ſyſtem, or the whole Art of Health, beauty, love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, long-life and happineſs, temporal and eternal; WHICH, if properly and conſtantly attended to, phyſicians and dignified clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, would be almoſt as unneceſſary in the world, as ſoldiers and ſolicitors; and as are ſuch codes of laws and diſcipline, in church and in ſtate as they are at preſent ADMINISTERED in almoſt every nation on earth,—which are in general dark, unreaſonable, unjuſt and diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and extremely contradictory to the ſpirit, and advancement of true religion, ſound policy, and of the Healing Art, however agreeable to the letter of the law, the canons of the churches, or the practice of the Royal Colleges of Phyſicians. Millions of the human ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies have felt, and millions do now feel, too ſenſibly the truth of this aſſertion.—O Law! O Phyſic! O Divinity! when—when will you under go a neceſſary ordeal—a thorough, a rational reformation I— As to WARS—I will not mention them; for my whole frame qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers with horror even at the thought of them.—Carnage!— bank-ruptcies, poverty! — devaſtation! —hunger and thirſt,—horrible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions!—forced from our native land;—and all theſe for what? why, for the honor and Glory of the God of mercy and peace —for a punctilio of what is called national honor;—too often indeed for nothing at all—to obtain an eventual evil—or for the acquiſition of the ſhadow of a ſhade. I could almoſt venture I think to prophecy, that the time will come, tho' perhaps it is very diſtant, when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and differences of nations, and what is called the ballance of power, will be ſettled by leſs horrible—leſs unnatural—leſs diabolical means than fire and ſword; and that the children of thoſe men, naval and military, who are now trained up to, and who glory in ruin and devaſtation, carnage, theft, depredation and murder, will be taught to adorn the ſciences, embelliſh the arts, or to illuminate the human mind—inſtead of hewing down like ſavage monſters, their fellow creatures—or of eating up, like drones, the bread of the children of induſtry. But I beg pardon for making this digreſſion; I beg pardon, I mean, of their Worſhips and High Mightineſſes, the CLERGY!!! the HEROES or MEN OF WAR!! the LAWYERS! and the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0619400100:6"/>phyſicians, and I will now return to finiſh the deſcriptive ſketch of the nature and properties of my electrical aether.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of laſt winter I had frequent opportunities of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the good effects of this eſſence, and of the nervous aetherial balſam, upon many Ladies and Gentlemen who were uncommonly ſuſceptible of the evils which ariſe from the cold rawneſs and fogs of this variable climate; occaſioning rehumatic complaints in the joints, and ſtill more particularly in the head and face, with ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the cheek and gums, ſore throats, and tickling defluxions on the breaſt and lungs. By the uſe of theſe two medicines, and by keeping the body open with the Imperial Pills, thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints which formerly had confined them almoſt conſtantly thro' the winter to the houſe were happily prevented; and in others who were ſeized as uſual, the cough, ſoreneſs of the breaſt, fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and inquietudes were ſpeedily carried off by the gentle and moderate uſe of theſe precious, and moſt friendly medicines.</p>
               <p>But the electrical aether is more eſpecially neceſſary for thoſe who attend courts of juſtice, public meetings, ſick perſons, and thoſe places where hundreds of common people are crammed up in the galleries, &amp;c. Nothing in nature <hi>is</hi> or <hi>can</hi> be equal to the electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal aether, the nervous aetherial balſam, and the cool open air in curing all, even the very worſt, and moſt confirmed ſpecies of low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervous-putrid fevers; ulcerated and gangrenous ſore throats; the ſmall-pox,—mortifications, and the whole tribe of putrid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive, dropſical, ſcorbutic and paralytic diſorders. By only ſmell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, or breathing over the aether, and taking now and then a tea ſpoonful of it, or of the balſam in a cup of white wine,—tar water, or common cold water,—the patient always finds inſtant relief, and generally a perfect cure; while thoſe about him, or in the houſe, are effectually ſecured from that dangerous malignancy which often ſweeps off whole families into one common and untimely grave.</p>
               <p>As the effects, or rather the medicines themſelves, fly in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the ſwiftneſs of light from the ſun—over the whole ſyſtem, no other cordial whatever in nature has been found ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneouſly and ſo laſtingly to recruit the ſtrength and ſpirits after great fatigue, or violent exertions of body or of mind, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Venereal pleaſures.—They refreſh, brace, compoſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and literally ſpeaking, ILLUMINATE, all the bodily,—and thro' them—all the mental faculties; in ſhort, in all ſevere ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, in ſinkings, and in faintings in conſequence of ſevere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciating pain, profuſe evacuations of blood, &amp;c. and draining weakneſſes of every kind, or from whatever cauſes proceeding, theſe medicines (eſpecially the nervous aetherial balſam) are ALWAYS found to produce the moſt aſtoniſhing good effects, which are manifeſted to the patient, and to every one preſent, even the firſt minute they are uſed.</p>

               <p>IF the reader can conceive of the richeſt—pureſt—and moſt ſtrengthening parts of all the cordial and nouriſhing things he is acquainted with in nature—being extracted, purified, exalted, harmonized and concentrated into a ſmall compaſs,—he may alſo conceive of the nature and properties of this precious balſam.</p>
               <p>The Peruvian bark, cinnamon, ſaffron, caſtor, lavender, ſage, roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, red-roſe-buds, electrical nitre, ambergriſe, myrrh, amber, and benjamin;—the balſams of Tolu and Gilead,—and various other bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my bracers, and fragrant aromatic ſtrengtheners are ſelected with my own hand, and prepared under my own eye: a pure aetherial eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, combined with a certain portion of the richeſt and moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine wine, is then poured upon the ingredients, and being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly mixed and ſecured, they are placed to macerate and digeſt, like the electrical aether, under the united influences of dephlogiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated or vivifying air, aether, magnetiſm and electricity, in the great globes which compoſe the tremendous pyramids on the domes of the Temples.</p>
               <p>From the preſent general ſtile of living—from the luxury, folly, diſſipation, and enervating indulgences of perſons, perhaps of every rank, the diſorders which now a days prevail, and which haraſs and wear out human life, are ſuch as proceed either from condenſed fluids, morbid humours, and heterogeneous viſcidities in the blood or lymph;—or, from irritation, relaxation and debility of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids and nervous ſyſtem. The former however complicated,—how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever various in their appearances, are very juſtly attributed to vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, ſcorbutic, gouty, or ſcrophulous humours—and the latter are promiſcuouſly and not improperly termed nervous; they ariſe chiefly from tepid ſoft luxurious and artificial living, enervating indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, I mean in venereal pleaſures, and from drinking daily that agonizing yet bewitching poiſon, foreign tea; and are often ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing and oppreſſive to the miſerable patient,—as to make riches and honours, and even life itſelf a burthen—a weary and heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, which they would gladly,—nay even ſometimes—impiouſly and fatally venture to lay down.</p>
               <p>In the former caſes, namely, in viſcidities and impurities of the blood and juices, from ſcorbutic, venereal, gouty and rheumatic humours, the Imperial Pills, by and by to be deſcribed, will be found in general the ſafeſt and moſt certain antidote: and in the latter, viz. in all nervous, putrid and debilitated habits, this nervous
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0619400100:8"/>atherial balſam is without exception the mildeſt and moſt effectual remedy that can be met with in the whole circle of nature!—for in all nervous complaints and weakneſſes;—in all convulſions, epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptic, apoplectic and hyſteric fits, in all obſtructions and irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in the monthly periods of women, particularly at the two cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and moſt dangerous periods of commencement and final ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, this Balſam, the Electrical Aether, or the Imperial Pills, are abſolutely infallable in producing the happieſt effects. For I will venture to ſay, that there is ſcarce a menſtrual obſtruction in the world—however complicated, or however confirmed, but what will be overcome and effectually removed by taking three tea ſpoonfuls of the <hi>electrical aether</hi> and as much of the Nerv. Aeth. Balſam, mixed both together in a pint of cold water for three ſucceſſive mornings, if the patient is plump and ſanguine; but if on the contrary, ſhe is lean, cold and languid, ſhe muſt take three tea ſpoonfuls <hi>of the</hi> NERVOUS AETHERIAL BALSAM, and the like quantity of the Electrical Aether, thrice every day in wine, ſpirits, or herb tea, and continue it for only three days. In both caſes, and under theſe oppoſite cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, with due attention to the above diſtinctions, a perfect cure will undoubtedly take place; eſpecially if plenty of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines be rubbed on the loins and back bone, and in the former caſe the application of cold water is made to THE PARTS, hands and feet, for hours daily,—and in the latter caſe warm wine or ſpirits and water—be applied daily in like manner.—In both, and in every caſe, running about in the open air is earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.—But when the patient is too much weakened and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the <hi>oppoſite cauſes,</hi>—namely, too long—too copious and profuſe a flow,—and great paleneſs and debility brought on; —REST, <hi>cool air,</hi>—the application to the parts, and indeed to every part of the body and limbs, of cold milk and water, or red wine, and a courſe of the nervous aetherial balſam, with an infuſion or tea of the Peruvian bark, red roſe leaves, and a little nitre, with Briſtol or Spa water —will build her up into a rock of ſnowy alabaſter, ſtudded with roſes and ſtreaked with celeſtial blue, removing the cauſes of ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility, or barrenneſs,—making her a lovely and deſirable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion! —a healthy and a happy mother!—But for farther particulars relative to theſe delicate and important matters, ſee my "Private Medical Advice to Married Ladies and Gentlemen; to thoſe eſpecially who are not bleſſed with children"—with full directions for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or for ſpeedy and perfect recovery after miſcarriages and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous lyings-in. To be had, compriſed and printed in two ſheets folio, ſealed up, ALONE at my Houſe in the Adelphi, and at the Temple of Hymen, in Pall Mall, price only One Guinea.</p>
               <p>N. B. In the above, ſuch ſimple, natural, and effectual means for removing the cauſes of barrenneſs in both ſexes as never were recommended, or even thought of before, in any age or nation,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0619400100:9"/>—are pointed out;—and ſuch directions given, as will, if duly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, make man and wife ſweeter—lovelier—more amiable, —and more DESIREABLE in the eyes of one another.</p>
               <p>After what has been already ſaid, I need ſcarcely add, that in all ſcarlet, miliary, jail, bilious, nervous, putrid, ſpotted and ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lignant fevers—eſpecially thoſe of the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, &amp;c. theſe medicines are abſolute and ſpeedy ſpecifics. A perſon armed and provided with theſe, and with the genuine powder of Dr. James, need not fear any inflammatory fever, or any low, putrid, malignant, or biſious fever or complaint whatever; in any climate, ſeaſon, or in any part of the terraqueous globe. Theſe will be a moſt complete apothecary's ſhop, and nature, common ſenſe, and the patient's own feelings—a <hi>trio</hi> of the ſafeſt and wiſeſt phyſicians.</p>
               <p>In every caſe, therefore, where the patient is low, faint, feeble or emaciated, from ſcorbutic or venereal virus, a ſharp poverty— or putrid diſſolution of the blood and juices;—or from want of a due elaſtic tone of the ſolids—ariſing from a deficiency of the vital ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits—or of the balmy nervous fluid, this nervous aetherial balſam! has not its equal in nature;—and this I aver CONFIDENTLY, from very much, and very happy experience in actual practice, which in all things is the only infallible guide—the only incontrovertible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence! Thouſands by it alone, have been ſnatched from the grave: and ſtill many more thouſands of the human ſpecies when languid and worn out with diſeaſes, exceſſes, irregularities, enormities and early imprudencies, have been ſuddenly built up into firm rocks of blooming health, and intellectual happineſs.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this ſhort account of this great medicine, by obſerving, that in all leſſer nervous complaints and uneaſineſſes, occaſioned by tea, coffee, adulterated wine, or pernicious liquors; and in all thoſe little lingering fevers, heats and chillineſſes, and thoſe tremors and quiverings of body, and reſtleſs anxieties, dread, horrors, diſcontent and unſettledneſſes of mind, which proceed merely from an irregular circulation of the blood, or from ſpaſms, debility, or relaxation of the nervous ſyſtem,—this aetherial balſam will always be found of immediate ſervice, and by a gentle— perſevering courſe of it, and of the Imperial Pills, duly attending to the directions given with them, a perfect and a laſting cure will in general be obtained. Becauſe by them the blood and juices are purified, ſweetened, tempered, and brought to a pure fluid ſtate, while the ſolids are braced and ſtrengthened, and the nerves ſheathed, nouriſhed, ſteadied and coiled up.</p>
               <p>Many fanciful, rich, and luxurious people, who are in fact in good health, and who ought by no means to take this precious aetherial balſam, or any other medicine, nevertheleſs accuſtom
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0619400100:10"/>themſelves to take more or leſs of it, and even an imperial pill or two every day;—with ſuch people, or when at any time they are taken into a ſound and tranquil body, they produce no other operation or ſenſation, than a more genial and briſker flow of the blood and animal ſpirits,—and that ſpecies of contentment, thankfulneſs, and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gladneſs of heart, which makes us happy in ourſelves, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all about us: but where they meet with diſeaſes and corruption, they encounter them with the boldneſs and majeſty of a lion, effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thally expelling them, and leaving a clean and a quiet houſe for health and happineſs to reſide in.</p>
               <p>The nervous aetherial balſam, then, is by very far, and without exception, the moſt exhilerating, antiſpaſmodic, bracing, reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ſtrengthening, and conſequently antiſceptic medicine in the world—infinitely ſuperior to the common tinctures of the bark, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerian, caſtor, ſaffron, lavender, &amp;c.—and infinitely more cordial and mild than the burning inflammatory ſalts, and fiery fetid ſpirits of hartſhorn, eau de luce, ſal volatile, and all the liqueurs, drams, and cordials, foreign and domeſtic, which only bewitch and give a temporary relief, which muſt ſoon give way to additional horror, darkneſs, dejection and deſpair.</p>

               <p>THIS title was given to them to mark their exceeding ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over all the analeptic or ſtomachic pills, antiſcorbutis drops, and alterative purifying medicines that perhaps ever were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, or which are now uſed in the world.—In all weakneſſes, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, flatulencies, cholickly gripings, and windy diſtenſions of the ſtomach and bowels, eſpecially when thoſe uneaſy, and indeed tormenting complaints proceed from ſcorbutic, venereal, gouty or bilious humours, freting, corroding, and irritating the nervous coats of the ſtomach and bowels;—or from heats, acidities, crudities and indigeſtions, occaſioned by full and foul feeding; exceſſive drinking of hot and foul wines and liquors; heats and colds, or ſurfeits; ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular and late hours as to ſleep; want of exerciſe, and perſpiration, &amp;c. &amp;c,—in all ſuch caſes, the Imperial Pills are conſtantly found to give immediate relief, and if the perſon is prudent and temperate, by a regular and gentle perſeverance in the uſe of them—a perfect and a laſting cure will, with a moral certainty, be obtained.</p>
               <p>Theſe pills are a compoſition of the pureſt parts of the choiceſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> combined and rendered ſtill more
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0619400100:11"/>active, by the united influences of air, aether, and magnetiſm<note n="*" place="bottom">Hippocrates, Galen, Celſus, Sir Iſaac Newton, Van Helmont, Paracelfus, Deſcartes, Sydenham, Boyle, Boerhaave, and many others of the greateſt phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers and phyſicians, ancient and modern, that ever bleſſed and enlightened the world, <hi>prophecied,</hi> and in all their writings <hi>inſiſted upon it,</hi> that whenever the practice of phyſic arrived to a high degree of perfection, or medicines were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered which would effectually eradicate diſeaſes, inducing health and peace in the body and mind, alleviating the preſſures of age, and lengthening human life to the longeſt poſſible period, it would be done by attending to the ſimple; yet divine voice of nature, and by the united influences of the great primary princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or natural agents which I ſo happily employ for thoſe moſt important por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. Animated by the concurring opinions of thoſe great men,—ſtimulated by the proſpects which were opened to my view by thoſe bright luminaries of ſcience!—ſhocked, too, at the very tranſcient, rapid and painful progreſs of man thro' this world;—and moreover, almoſt mad at the trifling abſurdities of the ordinary practice in this uſeful but dangerous art—and at the too feeble—or too harſh effect of moſt medicines as commonly uſed,—I was compelled with a certain, as it were divine or ſupernatural energy or impulſe, to ſearch for wider and more rational paths, and more effectual means for the prevention and cure of diſeaſes; how far I have ſucceeded thoſe who are acquainted with my medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines and practice, or who even have read my late publications, will be able to judge.—I will only ſay, that according to my abilities, and agreeable to the ideas and directions of thoſe great men, I have ſtudied and endeavoured to unite every affinity that there is between the elements and man:—between the ſun, moon and ſtars, and man;—and in ſhort between man and every thing in the great ſyſtem of the univerſe (which affects his body, and thro' that his mind) however remotely, however inviſibly connected with his frame. But as the <hi>perfecting</hi> all this vaſt and moſt comprehenſive ſyſtem requires a degree of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuce far—very far ſuperior to what I can pretend to, I truſt that God will raiſe up a ſucceſſion of men who will carry on and perfect what I have ſo happily begun.
<p>In the mean time, I reſpectfully intreat the correſpondence of all men of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſcience, and ingenuity; moſt earneſtly beſeeching every man and woman in the world, <hi>without exception,</hi> to communicate to me perſonally, by their friends, or by letter, any thing that they already know, or may hereafter diſcover, for the cure, alleviation, or prevention of any one diſeaſe; or for rendering human exiſtence longer or happier on this earth: and likewiſe whatever they now know, or may hereafter diſcover for the improvement or embelliſhment of religion, philoſophy, or the uſeful arts; eſpecially in metals and minerals. I will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely happy to be favoured with the opinions and conjectures of perſons of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, of goodneſs of heart, or of excentric brilliant imaginations. And as this correſpondence will coſt each of my friends individually, but a few pence for paying the poſtages of their letters, while otherwiſe the aggregate, centring in me, would coſt probably ſeveral hundred pounds annually; I hope therefore that my liberal, polite, and ingenious correſpondents will continue to have the goodneſs to write to me, POST PAID.

                  </note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true principles of electricity, and of the philoſophic chemiſtry, and are conſtantly acted upon by theſe powerful and moſt genial agents for ſeveral months in the upper globe, of the pyramidal
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0619400100:12"/>metal dome of the Temple of Health, which globe alone, like each of the other three, contains thirty-ſix gallons, and is of the fineſt burniſhed gold.</p>
               <p>The Imperial Pills are of ſo mild and friendly a nature that they are found to agree perfectly well with both ſexes and with every age and conſtitution. They operate firſt by diſſolving all tough, cold phlegm or ſlime, and other groſs, corrupted, bilious and putrid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which not only clog and irritate the ſtomach and bowels, but form a neſt and nouriſhment for thoſe common and moſt deſtructive vermin, WORMS—which they effectually kill, evacuate and carry off by ſtool and urine: after that, by continuing their moderate uſe as an alterative, without change of diet, confinement, or any irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome reſtraint whatever, they ſubdue, eradicate, and expel by ſtool, urine, and a breathing inſenſible perſpiration, all ſcorbutic, gouty, rheumatic, venereal, bilious and ſcrophulous humours, however long they may have lurked and prevailed in the ſyſtem, preying on, and exhauſting the ſtrength and ſpirits, and undermining and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying all the ſprings and principles of life.</p>
               <p>Rubbing and exerciſe are univerſally allowed to be good for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery as well as for the preſervation of health. Now theſe act by exciting the electrical fire in the body which removes obſtructions, animates and braces. The Imperial Pills therefore, and the Aetherial Balſam, being filled with the electrical or celeſtial fire, and ſolar light, which the balmy reſins of which they are compoſed have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed and do retain, promote all the natural and neceſſary circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſecretions and abſorptions, and conſequently <hi>muſt</hi> be of the greateſt ſervice to thoſe perſons, eſpecially to females, who take too little free air and exerciſe, tho' at the ſame time they live full, and are of a coſtive or irregular habit. Upon the ſame grounds they are found exceedingly beneficial in thoſe heats, ſpaſms, pains, and uneaſineſſes in females, occaſioned by the <hi>periodical</hi> fulneſs of their veſſels, and <hi>from certain other cauſes:</hi> but the good effects in gouty, ſcorbutic, and rheumatic caſes, and in all eruptions, or pimples of the face,—ſores or blotches, of the body and limbs, however invete rately blended in the blood,—however obſtinately confirmed in the conſtitution—are really aſtoniſhing. The dreadful train of ſufferings which the miſerable patients in the above caſes endure, and even the moſt obſtinate rheumatic ſwellings and weakneſſes of the joints, &amp;c. yield very readily to the ſuperior efficacy of theſe excellent pills;—
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0619400100:13"/>and they are a diuretic of ſo ſoft yet ſearching a nature, that they generally give very ſpeedy eaſe in ſevere fits of the ſtone and gravel, and by perſevering in a proper courſe of them, and of my Nervous Aetherial Balſam at the ſame time, and drinking veal broth with plenty of gum arabic diſſolved in it, or of a decoction of liquorice, linſeed, and marſhmallow roots poured upon ſhred leeks, and bruiſed fennil ſeeds with ſome honey or treacle, they often have been found to cure radically thoſe moſt painful and moſt excruciating diſorders.</p>
               <p>But in all leſs grievous, tho' abundantly troubleſome complaints of the firſt paſſages—they are an abſolute ſpecific. For they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reſtore loſt appetite, and correct all hot, acrid, and four fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations in the ſtomach and bowels, which they ſo genially cool and invigotate, as to enable them to concoct and extract thoſe fine mild nutritious juices of our food and drink, which nouriſh the body and gladden the ſoul. By theſe means the breath is rendered balmy and ſweet; the face is cleared from ſcurf, heat and pimples, prema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wrinkles are ſmoothed away and obliterated, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion rendered clear, ſmooth freſh and youthful; and all theſe happy effects are produced inſenſibly as it were, without (as I ſaid before) confinement, particular regimen in food or drink, or hindrance of buſineſs; their operation, like the Nervous Aetherial Balſam, being ſo mild and congenial to human nature, that they may be taken under any circumſtance, in any climate, or at any ſeaſon of the year, tho' when taken merely as a preſerver of health, the ſpring and autumn ſeaſons are doubtleſs the moſt proper.</p>
               <p>The Imperial Pills therefore, while they fortify the ſtomach and bowels, and purge the blood and lymph from all morbid humours, and <hi>heterogeneous</hi> ſharpneſſes and viſcidities, they ſo perfectly eradicate all venereal and ſcorbutic diſeaſes, that I defy the world to bring me any ſuch caſe if <hi>at all curabl,</hi> but what I will radically, ſpeedily and ſafely cure by a proper courſe firſt of theſe pills, and afterwards of my Aetherial Balſam, without the uſe of one grain of that horrible poiſon, mercury. Indeed <hi>than</hi> theſe medicines, and my Electrical Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, there has been no others as yet diſcovered, whatever quacks and empyries may pretend, which ſo ſpeedily and ſo completely counteract the deadly effects of mercury, and other violent medicines, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo tear, ſhake, and debilitate the conſtitution as to make the dear bought cure of the primary complaint, no great bleſſing to the feeble <hi>unnerved</hi> patient. This ſingular and moſt invaluable quality of the Imperial Pills is ocularly demonſtrated to the patient and to all his friends, by almoſt inſtantly ſtopping the higheſt ſalivation, throwing off the pocky or ſcorbutic virus, &amp;c. by ſtool, by urine, and by ſweat: and by making the quickſilver run off in globules by ſtool in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities nearly proportioned to thoſe that had been unfortunately uſed. Now the univerſally <hi>allowed,</hi> and <hi>two well known</hi> effects of mercury are to diſſolve and break down the maſs of blood into a ſharp, watery
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0619400100:14"/>putrid gore;—and to tear, deaden, relax, and render tremulous the whole nervous ſyſtem; but the Imperial Pills carry the mercury and all venereal and ſcorbutic humours entirely out of the body, reſtoring the healthy tone of the ſtomach, bowels, and ſolids in general;—and the nervous aetherial balſam very ſpeedily warms, and ſteadies the cold—quivering—tottering body; reſtoring the balmy craſis of the blood and juices; ſheathing, bracing, and invigorating the dry, ſhrunk and tremulous nerves; and abſolutely cures all ſeminal weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and debility in both ſexes, from whatever cauſes proceeding, but thoſe eſpecially which ariſe from ill cured, neglected, improperly treated or repeated venereal complaints, early imprudencies, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities, and all unnatural and inordinate exertions and indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies eſpecially in the ſacrifices that are made to Venus, or to Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus<note n="*" place="bottom">One of the peculiar and moſt important properties of my Nervous Aetherial Balſam is to recover and produce that genial vital warmth, which is ſo different from an inflaming feveriſh heat.</note>. Let the inventors or proprietors of other medicines which are ſent abroad into the world, make a parade of their PATENTS, &amp;c.—For theſe great medicines I never thought of ſuch ſecurities or ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. No. I am not afraid of any one counterfeiting <hi>them,</hi> tho' I find it has been vainly and ridiculouſly attempted. The compoſitions are ſo curious and complex, and the ingredients ſo very ſubtil, that they will not bear to be analyzed by even the moſt ſkilful adept in philoſophical or pharmaceutical chemiſtry. I repeat it. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients are too coſtly and too numerous,—the proceſſes too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex and tedious,—and the apparatus employed in the preparation of them coſts too many thouſand pounds for moſt adventurers, even of abilities, in the medical or medicinal line to engage with or even to think of. They are now, I find, bought by ſome of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of the faculty, in various parts of the world as well as in theſe kingdoms, and exhibited in ſevere dangerous and important caſes ſometimes as their own preparations: and I aſſure the nobility, gentry, and even the faculty who are deſirous of knowing every ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in the compoſition of each, or of either of the three medicines, that they need only apply to me to be fully ſatisfied in every particular which they feel themſelves intereſted in. To know them is to approve of them; and to uſe them once, is to uſe and recommend them moſt cordially for ever. Such is their intrinſic excellency that they will bear every teſt—even the teſt—the criterion—the fiery ordeal of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the moſt confirmed, and moſt hopeleſs caſes:—for they have been brought to their preſent high ſtate of perfection by long and deliberate inveſtigations of the real qualities of medicines, by the deepeſt reſearches into chemiſtry, enlightened by the important diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries and improvements which have lately been made in natural philoſophy; and finally, by the niceſt and moſt aſſiduous attention to the effects and operations of the medicines themſelves, in a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0619400100:15"/>courſe of private practice in this, as well as in various foreign countries; and the invariable reſult of their judicious uſe has been effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, to prevent, and with certainty to cure moſt diſeaſes to which mankind is obnoxious,—but eſpecially thoſe which the natives of theſe iſlands are liable to at ſea or in foreign countries—inſomuch that many gentlemen, eſpecially of the army and navy would now almoſt as ſoon go to ſea without proviſions, or upon along journey without money as without a certain ſtock of theſe three precious remedies. Indeed, in the hands of people of prudence and good ſenſe, they ſuperſede the need of a travelling phyſician, or of any medicine cheſt—for they are of themſelves an apothecary's ſhop fully adequate to the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and cure of moſt diſeaſes. And ſo thoroughly convinced am I of the univerſal ſalutarineſs, and ſuperior efficacy of theſe three great medicines, that in a VERY few years I will probably relinquiſh the practical part of medicine altogether, but continue to diſpenſe theſe medicines all over the world, WHILE, for the good of the human ſpecies of every nation and clime,—even for the children of thoſe who ſhall be born a thouſand years hence, I will publickly teach medicine and philoſophy in academical lectures, and from time to time publiſh what I am now compiling, viz. a complete Syſtem of Prophylactic and Practical Medicine; or, the whole art (without even a ſhadow of reſerve) of preventing and curing diſeaſes. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, likewiſe, I may ſend into the world, a complete and rational Body of Divinity, or true vital religion, which I am now likewiſe preparing; and perhaps, moreover a manual of Human Prudence;—or a ſafe and complete guide of life: and a SIMPLE, yet full and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally digeſted code of laws for civil, political, and eccleſiaſtical government,—ſubmitted with great deference to thoſe, to whom they more immediately, and more properly belong. But to return, I was obſerving the efficacy of THE THREE GREAT MEDICINES in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring decayed, conſumptive, and worn-out conſtitutions, or after ſevere diſeaſes, harſh and improper medicines, or hardſhips and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in foreign hot climates. Upon this ſubject I can ſcarce ſay enough. Yet to thoſe who are acquainted with the medicines everything which even I <hi>could</hi> ſay, would be quite unneceſſary. What need is there to expatiate on the genial qualities of the ſun, which are univerſally felt, and univerſally acknowledged?—I will only obſerve for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the world in general, that in all ſuch caſes, they moiſten, warm, refreſh and build up the whole ſyſtem, with bland, mild, balmy and nutritious juices; and by inducing a free, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, ſteady and genial circulation of the blood <hi>(which is the true radical moiſture)</hi> ſpirits, and nervous fluid, or that aetherial inviſible principle which actuates the nerves, and which altogether conſtitute the balmy life of the body; and, finally, by inducing the due and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal action of the ſolids and fluids on each other; or in other words, that happy <hi>equilibrium</hi>—that peaceful balance! which nature
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0619400100:16"/>delights in, and conſtantly endeavours to maintain in the whole vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as well as inviſible creation—they produce in the human body that peaceful, homogene, tranquil ſtate which we call health, and which is doubtleſs the natural and original ſtate of all created things: for pain, diſcord and diſeaſe, are ſo very unnatural, that even pain and diſeaſe are only a departure from, and imply a poſſibility of health,—or the attainment of that ſtate which nature pants after, and which man originally poſſeſſed. All diſtempers are in fact but a ſtruggle between the <hi>vis vitae</hi> and the peculiar Miaſma, or <hi>Fomes Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi.</hi> Indeed every ſpecies and degree of pleaſure, and of bodily and mental happineſs which we enjoy in this world, are only the irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or emanations of this primary principle, namely, concord or health. This is the GREAT UNITY!—the root and branches—the flowers and the fruits—the ſap and the life of mankind; To contrive and adapt, from the harmonious combination of the four elements acting on natural ſubſtances of KNOWN EFFICACY, ſuch medicines as could root out diſeaſe, diſcord and ſtrife from the human body, and produce, cultivate and nouriſh this heavenly unity, hath been my conſtant ſtudy, I may ſay, day and night for many years. How far I have ſucceeded has been long and abundantly obvious, not only from the prodigious and unprecedented ſale of theſe Great Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; but from the aſtoniſhing and well known numbers which are daily diſmiſſed from the Temple of Health perfectly cured of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which had baffled all other human means. Now this unity or health,—this SELF-REMEDY in nature for all her diſorders, was the ſeal with which God impreſſed every thing at the creation. And it was THIS in man which was emphatically called, "the IMAGE OF GOD."—This was paradiſe for man! This was the paradiſe of the earth, and of all the elements.—But man departing from God, and from the innocence and ſimplicity in which he was created, brought diſcord and diſeaſes into his ſoul and body;—from hence proceeds his ſhort and uncertain exiſtence in this world; hence flow pain, diſeaſe and death;—and from hence, too, perhaps all evil and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions within and without, in the natural and in the moral world. All fevers, fermentations, jarrings, reſtleſsneſs, commotions, pains and diſeaſes in the human body, are, therefore proofs of that hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den—conſtitutional peace and health which it has loſt, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily gravitates unto, and endeavours to regain, altho' it knows not the way—nor is it always ſo happy as to meet with, or follow, a friendly and unerring guide.</p>
               <p>That the above medicines, conjunctly, are ſuch a friend—ſuch a guide! no one will doubt who has attended properly to the plain, open and ſimple deſcription which I have given of them; nor will any one deny the truth of the fact, who has fairly and prudently uſed them—even in the moſt deſperate caſes. Theſe great medicines then, will reſtore health and tranquility—becauſe they reſtore in our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0619400100:17"/>body, as I have above ſhewn, that original unity,—balance—har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or <hi>equilibrium</hi> which nature delights in, and continually ſtrives to maintain in all her works—eſpecially in the human body and mind, as being the moſt perfect and important of all that ſhe has created, or placed on this terraqueous globe!</p>
               <p>Theſe, therefore, conjunctly, may juſtly be eſteemed the true and genuine UNIVERSAL MEDICINE!—the boaſted and long wiſhed for <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Materia!—Aurum potabile!</hi> or <hi>elixir vitae!</hi> of the philoſophers, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, and phyſicians of every age ſince medicine became a ſcience.—In theſe three medicines, by the wonderful influence of the mighty—primary—ſimple agents upon each other, and upon the ſimple ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances above mentioned, which for ſo many ages have been found ſo friendly to man—is produced and fixed,—a vivifying—homogene principle which counteracts diſeaſe, inſures health, and the prolonga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our mortal exiſtence. In the balmy bed of theſe three medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, all elementary and inteſtine ſtrife ceaſes. Here, the active—the irreſiſtible powers of air, earth, fire and water blend their ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly jarring principles, and are at peace. Here wih the ſwiftneſs of thought, they meet in one common centre. They kiſs each other as it were,—cordially embrace, and are at reſt in this paradiſiacal—this balmy bed. For be it known (and however paradoxical it may appear, it is nevertheleſs a certain—ſublime, and philoſophical truth) that the quickeſt motion, is the moſt perfect reſt. When a boy whips his top into the briſkeſt motion—it turns about with ſuch exceeding ſwiftneſs that it appears perfectly motionleſs—and he ſays it is aſleep. Would not any thing that could paſs from this to the Eaſt Indies and back again in the thouſandth part of a moment—be at perfect reſt?—could a thought—or any thing that could glance or be ſhot from your eye in London to the fartheſt verge—to the moſt diſtant point of the globe and back again in the millionth part of the time of a twinkle in your eye,—could it be ſaid to move at all?—Surely not.—When the cauſe of diſeaſe therefore is expelled by theſe great medicines they INSTANTLY compoſe all ſtrife. I NEVER ſwallow any wine, ſpirits, or malt liquor, ſtrong or weak, mixt nor unmixt, and yet I undergo daily with pleaſure, cheerfulneſs and good health, more fatigue of body and of mind, than perhaps any other man in London;—If, after the buſineſs of the day, or when I am forced to be up all night when ſent for in great emergencies—I find myſelf faint and exhauſted,—I immediately draw the vapour of the electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal aether with great force into my noſtrils—or pour a few tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoonfuls of it into a baſon of warm water and breathe over it;—and ordering a few new laid eggs to be beat as it were into a thin oil, and then mixed with ſome ſugar and <hi>very</hi> COLD water, I drink it off, and eating a bit of biſcuit, rich ripe fruits, or dry bread two days old, I find myſelf, in a few minutes, perfectly freſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0619400100:18"/>But what always aſtoniſhes me above meaſure is, the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly miraculous effect of my Electrical Aether, or NERVOUS AETHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIAL BALSAM, of which, when I take a tea-ſpoonful or two into my mouth upon a bit of ſugar, I feel my body refreſhed, braced, and ſtrengthened, and my mind enlarged and illuminated, in one moment. It darts its genial aetherial ſoul with the ſwiftneſs of light—or with the inconceivable ſwiftneſs above mentioned, through every nerve—vein—artery! I deſire to repeat, in other words, what I have already expreſſed; namely, that if thro' extreme bodily fatigue and anxiety, I feel myſelf as it were crampt in a cold dark room,—in a moment,—by the means of the electrical aether, and nervous aetherial balſam, I find myſelf ſaluted as it were by love,—joy, health and harmony! who in a moment fling open celeſtial ſcenes—and ſmiling, tranſport me on ſoft waving wings—with balmy and melodious gales, into the ſweet—brilliant, and flowery palace where they, the handmaids of HAPPINESS, reſide!—illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with ten thouſand lights of virgin wax!—or warmed and gilded with a vernal—a meridian ſun! But to deſcend from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of metaphor.</p>
               <p>Theſe wonderful and moſt genial medicines attune the body, and thro' it the mind;—or, rather, the mind and the body freed from diſcord and diſeaſe, recover, by their own energy, their natural and original healthy tone and brilliancy:—And this happy ſtate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained—every thing which ſurrounds us appears likewiſe pleaſant, gay and harmonious. Like, as in muſical inſtruments tuned in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, every chord which is touched, ſtrikes and calls forth, by its own vibratory force alone, a correſponding muſical tone from every octave in the other inſtruments in the ſame room, thus inviſibly touched. Theſe are facts perfectly well known to philoſophers, and to thoſe who have ſtudied muſic as a ſcience. But to return; I ſay, that upon the grounds of reaſon and common ſenſe, it is no wonder that theſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, when judiciouſly applied, are ſo efficacious as to remove all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders that ariſe from the jarrings and diſproportions of the conſtituent parts or qualities in human bodies—becauſe theſe medicines are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted, and accommodate themſelves to all, and health enſues in the moſt eaſy, ſimple, and natural manner. The wiſe and ſacred writer ſays, "That God hath created medicines out of the earth, and that he who is wiſe will not deſpiſe them."—Now as the qualities or virtues of all roots, leaves, flowers, fruits and ſeeds,—and of every medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal ſubſtance in nature, whether animal, vegetable, or mineral, muſt undoubtedly reſide in ſome little drops—ſome exquiſitely ſmall particles of ONE <hi>prima materia!</hi> which is the fountain or centre of exiſtence, life and health—and as this fountain—or ſource—or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0619400100:19"/>centre, is to be found alone by the gift of God; or, in other words, by his bleſſing on the reverential and aſſiduous labours and inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe who ſearch unweariedly into the vaſt treaſures of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with a view of promoting the good and happineſs of the world, and the honour and glory of God!—Whenever therefore, we can extract and concentrate from the adventitious, groſs, or inactive parts—the balmy, ſimple, homogeneous and viviſying particles of ſubſtances truly medicinal, by means of the harmonious combination of the great univerſal principles of air, aether, magnetiſm, electricity, and ſolar light, we need look for no other medicines; and I defy any phyſician to mention an indication in the cure of any diſeaſe, whether by altering, attenuating, opening, purifying, ſweating, purging, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, paſſing off by the kidnies; or by taking off ſpaſms and irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations—by bracing and comforting the nerves,—or by ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening and vivifying the whole ſyſtem, but may be anſwered in the completeſt and moſt friendly manner, by the judicious modulations and exhibitions of theſe three great medicines. They will therefore, upon principles perfectly demonſtrable, cure all curable diſeaſes, gladden the heart, illuminate the mind, and prolong human exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the longeſt poſſible period. Becauſe this exact mixture of hot and cold, moiſt and dry,—this harmonious tempering of the primary vital elements, coaleſcing like chords in muſic, muſt be peace makers in the ſtrife or diſorders of the conſtituent parts and qualities of man's body;—and becauſe the true quinteſſence of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is Fire. I don't mean the groſs, impure, conſuming, culinary fire which we have every day before us in the world: by no means. The fire which I employ in the cure of diſeaſes, and in the preparation of thoſe three great medicines, is the true elementary fire, which has been worſhipped as it were by the philoſophers of all ages. They <hi>had</hi> glimpſes of it; and even its dawn gleaming on their horizon filled them with ideas ſo vaſt and ſublime! that the herd of the world called them mad enthuſiaſts. How much greater felicity muſt <hi>we</hi> enjoy, upon whom the ſun of ſcience ſhines ſo bright as at this day. How much more may <hi>we</hi> benefit and enlighten the human ſpecies! But ſtill, the ſun juſt alluded to, is far—very—very far from having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained its meridian altitude It even now points, but at ſix o'clock of a ſummer morning. Yet how faſt—how ſweetly—do the buds of every branch of ſcience open!—The birds ſing—ALL NATURE RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JOICES! But thoſe charming fields—theſe delightful proſpects tempt me to wander too far. I will return. The fire I ſay which I employ in the cure of diſeaſes, and for the preparation of theſe great medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, is the univerſal living fire which connects and moves the whole ſolar ſyſtem—which animates all nature, and which you, my cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0619400100:20"/>reader—this book, the chair you ſit in, the charming object by your ſide, and in a word, every thing in the univerſe is full of; and which we can now in a moment extract, and make viſible or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to <hi>all</hi> your five ſenſes. This fire is the breath of life—the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God!—which he breathed at the creation into man's noſtrils, and which gives and maintains life throughout all his other works!—IT IS THE VITAL PRINCIPLE OF GENERATION! the fire which quickens the embryo in the womb!—even the pure fluid, celeſtial, electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal fire which pervades, purges, and animates ALL NATURE! con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming diſeaſe and corruption—attracting and uniting the four ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments—without deſtroying their variety or diſtinct powers,—becauſe it is itſelf a compoſition of them all—the joy of them all—and in a word the great band or material ſoul of the univerſe!</p>
               <p>THIS, <hi>then,</hi> is the natural—the celeſtial quinteſſence or inſtuence with which thoſe three great medicines are impregnated—and with which they are replete:—even with the harmonious combination of the four elementary qualities in ONE;—and whenever this pure and ſimple light, or concord is received into the body—diſeaſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord <hi>muſt</hi> vaniſh, as the cold and darkneſs of the night muſt vaniſh at the preſence of the morning—of the ſummer's ſun!—and I will now conclude this ſhort and very imperfect account of my great medicines with aſſuring thoſe ſick and infirm perſons who have not yet had the happineſs to partake of their ſalutary influences,—that they are in their nature and operations, eaſy and benign,—genial and gentle as a dove—ſtrengthening and exhilirating the ſoul and body of<note n="*" place="bottom">Thoſe who <hi>will</hi> have the ſoul to be IMMATERIAL; will be perhaps highly offended at my bringing it in upon every occaſion, head and ſhoulders with the body. The reaſon is, becauſe I can no way ſucceed in ſeparating them. We all know that light, though ſupremely pure, and infinitely ſubtil—is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs material: and I agree ſo far with the generality of the world, as to conſider the human ſoul as a ſubſtance (or emanation in conſequence of the exquiſite or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization of our body)—ſo exquiſitely—ſo ſupremely pure and ſubtilias to be abſolutely inviſible and inconceivable to any or all of our ſenſes. I find that the materiality or nature of the ſoul is <hi>now</hi> a point bitterly diſputed by philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors. For my own part, I profeſs that I know nothing at all about the matter. I know, however, that it is a point which we have no ſort of buſineſs with;—and as, to <hi>this,</hi> and all other matters which ARE NOT ESSENTIAL to our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in this, or in any other ſtate of exiſtence—and which <hi>cannot poſſibly be ſettled</hi> in this world—I think we had better be eaſy, and not quarrel—wrangle—and diſturb one another about ſuch abſtruſe, metaphyſical, and I may ſay, nonſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, matters. Thus I have in three words, written all that I ever intend to write upon this ſubject.</note> thoſe to whom they are thankfully and prudently adminiſtered:—whilſt at the ſame time they are as ſtrong and as furious as lions in ſubduing and evacuating diſeaſes, and every thing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0619400100:21"/>that is injurious or unfriendly to good health, or to human exiſtence. But the ſtrength above alluded to, is the ſtrength of a protector—and the fury, that of love!—becauſe they hurt not the weakeſt or moſt delicate, in infancy or in old age:—to the former they are as milk and honey—to the latter, as generous wine, or the ſmootheſt—the ſweeteſt oil!—and to purſue the metaphor, they are in the laſt ſtages, of moſt ſevere and fatal diſeaſes, what freſh oil is to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring lamp—when the flame is, like a ſickly ſhadow quivering and gaſping in the dry ſocket.</p>
               <p>Theſe great medicincs which are ſold at no other place in London or Weſtminſter but at the TEMPLE OF HEATH! ADELPHI, and at the TEMPLE OF HYMEN, in PALL-MALL, are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully put up and ſecured in ſtrong flint vials:—even the Imperial Pills—becauſe they would immediately loſe their virtue if kept in a pill-box—or expoſed to the open air. The three medicines are all ſold at the ſame price, viz.—in vials of five Shillings, Half a Guinea, and One Guinea each.—For the conveniency of the navy and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,—of the commanders of Eaſt and Weſt-India ſhips—and of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and gentlemen travelling by ſea or land, proper aſſortments of <hi>all the three</hi> medicines, are put up in mahogany cabinets of Five, Ten, and Twenty-Five Guineas—with very ample, directions. By which means not only much money to phyſicians, apothecaries, &amp;c. may be ſaved, but likewiſe under God, the lives of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred perſons of worth, faſhion and of fortune, who travel into fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign countries—may be yearly preſerved,—who, otherwiſe, might be ſwept off by diſeaſes in a few days—when abſent from their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and far diſtant from their affectionate friends.</p>
               <p>Proper allowance is made to merchants and captains of ſhips who buy them in large quantities for ſale in foreign countries. In all <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> and RELAXATIONS—and in BILIOU, ſpaſmodic putrid malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and conſumptive complaints, in the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies, and in America—they are immediate and abſolute ſpecifics. So that any lady or gentleman of ſenſe and liberality, may, THUS ASSISTED, become ſovereign phyſicians, and often ſave not only their own, but the life of a friend or of a fellow creature, when apparently at the point of death—and when given over by even the beſt phyſicians. But above all, they are moſt earneſtly recommended to people of weak nerves and relaxed habits—who are particularly ſuſceptible of catching colds and infectious diſorders—to thoſe likewiſe who are apprehenſive of ſtrokes of the apoplexy or pally—and ſtill more, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to thoſe under ſentence of death—I mean thoſe perſons who have already been viſited by thoſe ſudden—dreadful—and mercileſs harbingers of the awful—the tremendous hour!</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0619400100:22"/>
               <p>⁂ Any reſpectable perſon, <hi>not of the faculty,</hi> in any capital city or town in Great-Britain or Ireland—or in any other part of the world, where theſe great medicines are not yet eſtabliſhed,—and who are very deſirous to vend them, ought to loſe no time in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, thro' their agents or correſpondents in London. As ready money is expected, a proper allowance is made; but all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of carriage, advertizing, &amp;c.—muſt be defrayed by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons themſelves; and it is an invariable rule with me to return im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the money for what ever quantity may at any time be ſent back as unſold.—In order to prevent trouble, I think it right to be very particular in mentioning the terms or conditions upon which I diſpenſe theſe medicines all over the globe, for the general good of mankind, as well as for my own honour and emolument.</p>

               <head>GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR USING MY THREE GREAT MEDICINES.</head>
               <p>THE principles or conſtituent parts of theſe Medicines being ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar—they are found to produce the beſt effects and the greateſt and moſt extraordinary cures, when taken together, or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by each other. But in all caſes whatever, I deſire that thoſe who take them, do not regard <hi>my</hi> directions, ſo much as the effects of the medicines,—their own feelings; and their own prudence and good ſenſe. In <hi>acute</hi> caſes they can ſcarcely be uſed too plentifully; but in dangerous and long confirmed <hi>chronic</hi> caſes—they may be uſed more ſparingly, and continued longer. But, after a courſe of ſix weeks, if a complete cure be not obtained, they ſhould be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for three, ſix, or nine weeks, and then reſumed again as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. In all caſes and conſtitutions, in all habits of body, at every period of life, and under perhaps every circumſtance, cool air, drinking cold water plentifully, and bathing the whole body, or at leaſt the private parts with tepid or icy cold water, agrees perfectly well, and produces the happieſt and moſt Divine Effects.</p>
               <p>Let, therefore, my innumerable Tribes of Patients, I mean all who are taking my medicines, be almoſt conſtantly buſtling about in the cool open air, regardleſs of wind or rain; let them be daily, and very frequently applying cold water to their face, neck, boſom, ſtomach, private parts, and limbs; in ſhort, the partial or univerſal application of cold water to the ſurface of the body I earneſtly and moſt cordially
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0619400100:23"/>recommend: but ſtill more earneſtly, and above all things do I exhort to moderation, ſimplicity and regularity in eating, drinking and ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in all pleaſureable indulgences; in thoſe eſpecially <hi>(venereal)</hi> which drain the blood of its moſt precious balſam, and the nerves of their vital ſpirits; ſapping the ſources of health, and totally incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating both ſoul and body from the proper performance of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, neceſſary, and more noble functions,—and from enjoying with a keen healthy reliſh, the balmy—the celeſtial pleaſures—which the all-wiſe and ſupremely beneficent Author of our exiſtence hath annexed to our animal, as well as to our intellectual nature!</p>
               <p>As to the ELECTRICAL AETHER, the manner of uſing it has been already pretty well explained in the account which is given of its nature, preparation, and properties. In all caſes of weakneſs, fainting, putrifaction and debility, eſpecially in aſthmas, conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and all painful obſtructions of the head or breaſt, it may be ſmelled to for ſeveral minutes and very often. The vial ſhould be held in a warm hand to the patient's noſtril, and the other ſtopped by preſſing it ſideways with the finger, while the cold vapour is drawn up with great force. It ſhould not be taken away from the noſe notwithſtanding its ſtrength; for the longer the patient ſmells at it, the better able he is, for his breath becomes longer, and he ſeems to enter delighted into the flowery fields of Elyſium!—Often, very often have I exhauſted a whole bottle in one day, or evening, merely by ſmelling. A little of it may be poured into a pot or baſon of warm or hot water, brandy and water, green tea, coffee, or into an infuſion of aromatic herbs,—flowers, or ſeeds—eſpecially a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of mint, roſemary, lavender flowers, and bruiſed anniſeeds; over which the patient's hands and mouth open may be held, while it continues warm, drawing the vapor with great force into the lungs. In ſome caſes it may be adviſable to fling a large piece of flannel looſely over the patient's head, which will more effectually promote perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Any of the above, eſpecially the latter aromatics, may be uſed afterwards, when almoſt cold, to bathe the ſtomach, private parts, limbs, or feet. The Electrical Aether <hi>alone</hi> may be poured plentifully on the head, breaſt, back-bone or limbs of a perſon in any low—nerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous—or putrid complaint: This Aether, camphorated ſpirits, or vinegar, may be made to diſtil by a lamp, or be ſcattered about the room and bed cloaths—I have often uſed half a dozen guinea bottles of it in one day, on and about one perſon, when the caſe has been very bad, and the life very dear and precious. It may be taken inwardly in the quantity of a tea-ſpoonful, more or leſs, and as often as may be found good, perhaps every hour or two, on ſugar, or mixed with the ſyrup of capillaire, cold water, wine, or herb tea. The thicker and colder the vehicle, the better: the ſyrup, or icy cold vehicle ſhould be poured into an empty vial, then the Aether added to it,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0619400100:24"/>perhaps by gueſs, then cloſely ſtopped with the thumb or a cork, well ſhaken and drank immediately.</p>
               <p>In the very ſame manner, in ſimilar quantities, and at any or at all times, may be taken the NERVOUS AETHERIAL BALSAM. Indeed, they may be taken together at the ſame time; or the latter taken inwardly, while the Electrical Aether is ſmelled to, or applied outwardly; for the one tempers and co-operates with, and promotes the good effects of the other, in ſo cordial, friendly, and effectual a manner, that they act like a PAIR of crutches to a crippled and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled body. For a more full and particular account of the nature properties, &amp;c. of this Divine Balſam—or reſtorative Aetherial Oil, which ſo effectually renovates and invigorates decayed and worn out conſtitutions, I refer my intelligent reader to the deſcriptions already given.</p>
               <p>As to the IMPERIAL PILLS, or univerſal purifiers and ſweetners of the blood and juices; they may be taken conveniently at any ſeaſon, and under any circumſtance. When they are taken as an alterative, in coſtive, gouty, bilious, and ſcorbutic habits, or to throw off wind and flatulencies from the ſtomach and bowels in nervous weakneſſes, ſpaſms, and relaxations, one may be taken every night, or immediately after eating, when a perſon is oppreſſed and uneaſy, becauſe they ſo amazingly promote lively digeſtion and healthy nouriſhment, blunting all acid and bilious acrimony, ſtrengthening the relaxed tone of the ſtomach, and increaſing the periſtaltic or ſcrew-like motion of the inteſtines: but when they are taken to ſubdue, eradicate, and expel by ſtool, urine, and a fine breathing perſpiration all venereal, ſcorbutic, gouty, rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, bilious and ſcrophulous humours and foulneſſes, the patient may begin with one pill, and increaſe the doſe one every night, till they begin to produce a more copious diſcharge by ſtool, urine, or ſweat, than the patient can or ought to bear long. In ſuch caſes, the patient may diminiſh the number, one every night, till he comes to one only, and then after totally omitting them for as many days as in number he had taken the pills in one day, he may begin again, increaſing the number, one every night as at firſt.—This mode being obſerved, and repeated ſeveral times,—will moſt aſſuredly—will infallibly eradicate every particle of virus, diſeaſe and impurity, however long they may have lurked and prevailed in the ſyſtem, or however inveterately they have been blended and rooted in the conſtitution, ſapping or undermining the ſprings and ſources of life and of health, rendering life a tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and painful burthen to the feeble, ſpiritleſs, wretched poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor. It is really aſtoniſhing how ſpeedily and effectually theſe pills counteract and carry off the deadly effects of Mercury, and other ſtrong and improper medicines. This important and ſingular qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0619400100:25"/>and effects are produced by the large portion of electrical ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur or celeſtial phoſphorous which they contain.</p>
               <p>While a perſon takes theſe moſt excellent pills they may drink as much cold water as they pleaſe, or go out in any weather. The following drinks will likewiſe be very proper,—chicken, veal, or mutton broth, without ſalt. Beef-tea, capillaire and cold water. Infuſions of ſimple herbs, &amp;c. but when the pills are taken for ſevere and confirmed diſeaſes, proper regard ſhould be paid to the nature and degree of the diſorder or complaint, and the drinks, management, &amp;c.—ordered accordingly. For inſtance, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal, ſcorbutic, or ſcrophulous diſeaſes, a ſtrong decoction of ſarſaparilla, or of the guaiacum and ſaſſafras woods, with plenty of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorice root, ſhould be drank daily. In gouty, bilious, aſthmatic, conſumptive, and rheumatic caſes, infuſions of baum, roſemary, tanſey, horſeradiſh root, chamomile flowers, pennyroyal, hyſop, groundivy, horehound, linſeeds, liquorice root, with bruiſed fennil or aniſeeds, ſweetened with treacle, honey, ſugar candy, or barley ſugar, will be found extremely ſerviceable; and in all nervous and windy complaints, and in relaxation, irritation and debility of the ſyſtem in general, ſtrong decoctions or rather infuſions of the Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian Bark, in groſs powder, columbo or comfry roots, red roſe leaves, chamomile flowers, bitter orange peel, with a little bruiſed cinnamon—will be productive of the happieſt and moſt aſtoniſhing good effects. But in every caſe, and in every conſtitution, when any one, or all of my Three Great Medicines are taken, I have found half a pint or a whole one of apple tea, water gruel, barley water, or of the following compound infuſion, extremely good and agreeable, viz. of baum, ſage, roſemary, mint, and bruiſed aniſeeds—each an equal quantity, and the tea ſweetened with ſugar candy, barley ſugar—treacle or honey; or rather with a mixture of the two laſt. This tea or infuſion ſhould be drank warm, and indeed very warm and often, when any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable degree of perſpiration is wiſhed for or intended.</p>
               <p>In the intervals between taking the medicines, and indeed, in moſt conſtitutions, even at the time of taking them, a milk diet is warmly recommended. A quart or two, or even three quarts of good new milk may be uſed every day, not warm from the cow, or boiled, but cold, and as it is called, raw: for the natural heat of the human ſtomach is fully ſufficient to cook, or prepare milk, eggs, &amp;c. for every purpoſe of nutrition, and of health. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious application of fire renders them hard and indigeſtible—Many people loſe the great—the unſpeakable—the balmy benefit of a milk diet, by relinquiſhing it too ſoon. They find the firſt day or two, a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſickneſs at their ſtomach—a griping or laxity of their bowels, they therefore conclude that it diſagrees with them, and they leave it off. But they ought to continue it by all means for a week or ten
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0619400100:26"/>days, and at length it would in general be found to agree per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well, and to produce the happieſt effects.</p>
               <p>I cannot conclude, without taking notice of the general odium there is againſt a panacea, or medicine for the cure of <hi>all</hi> diſeaſes. At firſt I was very far from expecting that even theſe three medicines could, ſingly, or when combined, cure or even relieve all diſorders; but as I advanced in improving them, and in diſcovering their virtues in actual and moſt extenſive practice, I confeſs that my wonder and ſurpriſe exceeded the aſtoniſhment and delight which was excited in my happy patients. The wonderful good effects which I ſay are produced by theſe medicines in every caſe, and in every conſtitution, will, <hi>at firſt ſight,</hi> alarm and diſguſt perſons of ſenſe and learning, but on candid and mature views of theſe matters, they will be found to agree with, and to reſult from the fixt nature of things:—for the general notion of diſeaſes reaſonably conſiſts in this; that what is taken into the body is not duly aſſimilated and diſtributed by the force of the animal oeconomy. Is it not, therefore, true that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever aſſiſts and ſtrengthens the vis vitae, enables nature either to aſſimilate, or to diſcharge all groſs and noxious particles, unſubdued humours, and in a word, the ſeeds or cauſes of all diſeaſes whatſoever? for the celeſtial or electrical Light or Aether detained in theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and with which they are ſo fully impregnated or ſaturated, being of the very ſame nature with the animal ſpirits, or nervous claſtic light or fluid, is an acceſſion of ſo much ſtrength to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution or powers of nature, or ſtaff of life, by which it is aſſiſted to aſſimilate whatever is friendly and nouriſhing, or to throw off or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel whatever is alien or noxious to her nature,—or prejudicial to good health. Thus, then, theſe great medicines may be juſtly called univerſal ones, inaſmuch as they work principally by aſſiſting the vis vitae, or ſtaff of life, as an alterative and cordial, enabling nature by a prodigious acceſſion of congenial vital ſpirits, to aſſimilate thoſe friendly and neceſſary recruits or powers, which could not be aſſimilated by her own proper force, for ſubduing diſeaſes or maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing health. Thoſe who think that this cannot be effectually done but by ſtrong evacuations, entertain a moſt dangerous opinion; for great and repeated evacuations weaken <hi>nature</hi> as well as the diſeaſe; and thouſands who have recovered of diſtempers by great evacuations, and poiſonous medicines, ſuch as mercury, &amp;c. have never, during their whole life, been able to recover of the remedies.—But the luminous—balmy—celeſtial ſpirit or fire which is lodged and detained in theſe three Great Medicines, is of a nature ſo mild, benign, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the human conſtitution, as to warm without heating, to cheer but not inebriate or inflame, and to produce that calm ſerenity, that ſteady joy which naturally accompanies good health, and a virtuous mind:—and that too without thoſe agitations, irregular motions, and ſubſequent horrible ſinkings or depreſſions of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0619400100:27"/>animal ſpirits, which are the conſtant and inſeparable effects of volatile ſalts, ſpirits, foreign waters, and drams; and indeed of all fermented, vinous, ſpiritous, and even malt-liquors.</p>
               <p>N. B. Theſe great,—theſe truly celeſtial medicines, will keep good any length of time, and in any climate, provided they are kept very tightly ſtopped and as cool as poſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g> In a few days will be publiſhed and added to this pamphlet, about fifty extraordinary cures, lately effected by my three great medicines. In the mean time I have authority to mention the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing very extraordinary caſe of a reſpectable and very amiable young lady, a Miſs Beatt, at Mr. Schroeder's Ware-Houſe, (Robe and Habit-Maker to Her Majeſty) in Taviſtock-Street, Covent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Garden,—late Pritchard and Spilſbury's.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of laſt March, Miſs Beatt was ſeized with a ſevere diſorder which broke out on one ſide of her face, and ſpread to her eye, ear, neck, and throat. It was taken, and properly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, from the very beginning; but, nevertheleſs in two or three weeks it had ſpread over both ſides of her face and neck, which with both her eyes and ears, it had ſwelled to a monſtrous degree. The humour was ſo ſharp and ſo exceſſively profuſe, that day and night it would wet and run thro' twenty folds of cloths or handkerchiefs in one quarter of an hour, but notwithſtanding that incredible diſcharge the ſwellings did not abate, and thoſe under her ear, and about her throat, were as hard as a ſtone. The cataſtrophe of the ſcene being now at hand, and the young Lady herſelf, her affectionate father, and her anxious friends, being alarmed and apprehenſive of the moſt fatal conſequences—the ſervices of the Medical Gentlemen who attended her were diſpenſed with, and I was called in. The chilly ſhivering coldneſs, which indeed had been a moſt unfavourable ſymptom from the beginning, encreaſed, now, very faſt.—The terrible humour began to fall inward, and to be abſorbed into her blood, which it diſſolved and broke down into a putrid watery gore; and on the Sunday morning I found her laying with ſcarce any pulſe—cold, ſleepy like, complaining that ſhe could not ſwallow, and of a dead coldneſs in her limbs, on her left ſide particularly,—and a want of ſmell and all ſenſe of feeling in one ſide of her noſe. Her face, neck, eyes and ears were entirely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with a thick black cold cruſt or ſcab—like a complete maſk,—ſhe had been quite blind for near two days, and on examining her throat inwardly, I found the mortification there far advanced. From theſe ſymptoms and appearances, joined to what is called the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0619400100:28"/>rattles in her throat, which had now come on, and the putrid ſmell which, notwithſtanding every precaution, began to ſpread all over the houſe, every body was perſuaded that the melancholy ſcene would be cloſed in a very few hours; and I myſelf was apprehenſive that the deadly ſweep in the houſe might be great; a gentleman, a few ſtreets off, his wife, and ſome of their children and ſervants having been all ſwept into the grave by a putrid diſorder within the ſpace of one week, a few days before:—to whom I regret exceedingly, that I had not the good fortune to be called. But to return. What was to be done?—Miſs Beatt could not ſwallow but a few drops at a time, and that very ſlowly, and with the greateſt languor and danger of ſuffocation.</p>
               <p>No time was to be loſt with the patient, nor any thing left undone for the ſecurity of the family. Every window in the houſe, which Mrs Schroeder had very judiciouſly thrown open, and the frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe and other aromatics which that lady had wiſely burned on the ſtairs, by way of fumigation, were, (with the addition of camphorated aether to ſprinkle with) all continued.</p>
               <p>I immediately mixed a large vial of my NERVOUS AETHERIAL BALSAM, and another of my ELECTRICAL AETHER, with an equal quantity of the ſyrup of capillaire to ſoften them.—Of this mixture, I gave Miſs Beatt ſpoonful after ſpoonful, as faſt as ſhe could let it over, till ſhe had taken the whole of it. That part of it which run out of her mouth was not loſt; for it was abſorbed by her neck and breaſt.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of a quarter of an hour, I uſed no leſs than three whole vials of my ELECTRICAL AETHER on her face, neck, throat, &amp;c.—Another very large vial, containing four ounces or one Guinea's worth of it, was held continually to her noſtrils, and ſome of it a little diluted, was thrown into her noſtrils, and upon her throat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, with a ſyringe; and an infuſion with boiling water was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately prepared, of half a pound of the fineſt Peruvian bark, and an ounce of cinnamon, both in powder, and half a pound of red roſe leaves.—To this, when ſtrained, no leſs than half a pint of Mr. Jones's<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Jones, who is a chymiſt and druggiſt in Ruſſel Street, Covent Garden, is a man of fortune and character, and particularly attentive in having the beſt and moſt genuine medicines that can be procured.</note> very excellent tincture of the bark, was added. This was exhibited very often by way of glyſter, and a cupful of it drank as often as poſſible. But before it could be prepared, I had given Miſs Beatt another whole large vial of my nervous aetherial balſam, and had ſprinkled the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloaths well, all over, with my electrical aether—a large bliſter like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was applied between her ſhoulders, and one <hi>under</hi> each collar bone,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0619400100:29"/>backward, towards the top of her ſhoulders. What were the effects of theſe bold—theſe great operations?—They were moſt happy!—They appeared miraculous!—They ſnatched an amiable young perſon—an uſeful member of ſociety—I may ſay, from the very bottom of the grave. What would ordinary medicines—what would, what is called the <hi>regular</hi> practice, have done in this deſperate caſe?—why—nothing. The patient MUST INEVITABLY HAVE DIED. How very fortunate it was for Miſs Beatt that I was perſonally preſent to direct the proper exhibition of the three great medicines—to which under God! ſhe owes her life! In a quarter of an hour, from the time that the aetherial balſam was <hi>firſt</hi> given to her,—ſhe broke out into a general perſpiration; her pulſe was better;—the fulneſs, choaking, and inability of ſwallowing went off; the rattles ceaſed. At the end of another half hour, all theſe favourable appearances were more ſtrikingly manifeſted:—and at the expiration of one hour more, ſo rapidly did the cold numbneſs and ſleepineſs go off, and the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and putrefaction abate, that I conceived her to be even out of all danger. The putrid morbid matter which had fallen inward, and carried death to every veſſel and fibre of the ſyſtem being now ſo much overcome and ſubdued by the nervous aetherial balſam, and electrical aether, I was determined to loſe no time in carrying as much of it as poſſible out of the body. For that purpoſe, as Miſs Beatt could not be ſuppoſed to be as yet capable of ſwallowing <hi>pills</hi>—and even if ſhe could, it would have been a conſiderable time before they could have diſſolved in her ſtomach: I therefore diſſolved nine of my IMPERIAL PILLS in a proper vehicle, and gave the whole of them to her in the ſpace of an hour. The conſequence was, that they operated ſo properly and effectually, that I ventured to leave her that ſame night, being called into the city to attend to ſome caſes of great importance.</p>
               <p>I had ordered my ſervant to enquire after Miſs Beatt by ſix in the morning, and a gentleman, (a ſurgeon in the Eaſt-India Company's ſervice) who had the goodneſs to ſit up all night, being on a viſit at Mr. Schroeder's, (and to whoſe kind and judicious care we were all very much indebted,) ſent me word that Miſs Beatt was amazingly better, that ſhe had ſlept ſweetly great part of the night, that ſhe was then refreſhed and cheerful, with both her eyes quite open, and every unfavourable ſymptom entirely gone off.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not treſpaſs any longer on my reader's time; ſuffice it to aſſure him, that by continuing the medicines, &amp;c. in one week or ten days more Miſs Beatt came down ſtairs quite recovered. The black cruſty ſcabs or maſk dropt off her face, neck, head, throat and eats en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely; ſhe was once more perfectly herſelf,—and free from every ſpot, redneſs, or diſagteeable appearance—and with a good appetite, and high ſpirits, ſhe has continued perfectly well ever ſince; and thinks
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0619400100:30"/>that ſhe even enjoys better health than ſhe did before ſhe was attacked with that terrible diſorder:—and, it pleaſed God, that not one individual of that large and reſpectable family ſuffered an hour's illneſs from the imminent danger which had threatened them.</p>
               <p>N. B. Very few of the fifty cures lately performed by theſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which have been ſelected from a much greater number, and which are now printing, are leſs extraordinary or important than this above-mentioned.</p>

            <p>THE TEMPLE OF HEALTH! IN LONDON, IS OPEN FOR THE RECEPTION OF PATIENTS, AND FOR THE DISPENSATION OF The Three Great Medicines therein prepared, Every Day (Sundays excepted) from Eight in the Morning, till Eight at Night.</p>
            <p>The MEDICO-ELECTRICAL APPARATUS, In the Temple of Health, is allowed by every Body to be by far the largeſt and moſt ſtupendous, moſt uſeful, and moſt magnificent that now is, or that ever was, in the World. It occupies TEN ROOMS, and has coſt ſeveral Thouſand Pounds. Nature and Art—Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Nature—the Fine and the Liberal Arts! have been courted and exerted in the Execution of this great Work. Every Nerve of Genius and of Study has been ſtrained, and the Four Quarters of the Globe ranſacked to enrich and embelliſh it, and to render it one of the moſt uſeful of all the Inſtitutions which adorn the Age and Nation we have the happineſs to live in.</p>
            <p>DR. GRAHAM's new and improved methods of curing diſeaſes conſiſt in regimen, herbs, ſimple medicines, the choiceſt arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> and aetherial eſſences, rendered more ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and active by means of the moſt powerful vital agents in nature, viz. Electricity, Vivifying Air, Medical Muſic, and Magnetiſm; or in other words, by gently conveying to thoſe at the Altar, or on the Medico-electrical Throne, without ſhock, or any kind of uneaſineſs,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0619400100:31"/>into the general ſyſtem, to the ſeat of the diſeaſe, or only to parts par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly affected, the pure, active, genial, balmy, bracing, and reſtorative effluvia of medicines animal, mineral, or vegetable, ſimply, or combined with the celeſtial fire, or vital light, magnetic <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium,</hi> harmonious vibrations, or muſical modulations of celeſtial ſounds, or with any of thoſe great primary-elementary vital prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which are the univerſal <hi>Pabulum,</hi> or vivifying ſoul of the univerſe! The great numbers who daily, by theſe means, under God! are cured of the moſt dangerous and moſt confirmed diſeaſes, after they have been turned incurable out of hoſpitals, and given over by even the moſt celebrated Phyſicians, <hi>who</hi> STAND <hi>in the regular medical trammels</hi> are really aſtoniſhing. Dr. Graham. therefore, for the public good, as well as for his own honour and emolument, THINKS IT HIS DUTY to depart from what is called the regular mode, by giving this public notice, which is addreſſed to THE FRIENDS OF PERSONS APPARENTLY AT THE POINT OF DEATH, and to every individual who labours under any kind of complaint or infirmity which has reſiſted the ordinary remedies.—To ſuch, in whatever ſtation of life, this Advertiſement is addreſſed; but more eſpecially to the charitably diſpoſed Chriſtian—to the affectionate Parent—the dutiful Child—the fond Compannion—and the tender—the anxious Friend.</p>
            <p>The caſes which Dr. Graham has been the moſt remarkably ſucceſsful in curing, are the following:—viz. Violently dangerous Fevers, particularly ſcarlet, putrid, and nervous ones—Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Aſthmas and Coughs — excruciating pain and imminent danger from the Gout in the head or ſtomach—Apoplexy—putrid ulcerated Throats—Stone and Gravel—inflamations of the Brain, Lungs, Bowels, or Bladder—obſtinate and confirmed VENEREAL com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, from repeated infections and irregularities, or from having been neglected, trifled with, or improperly treated with that deadly poiſon mercury, ſevere purging, &amp;c.—Stomach and Bowel complaints—total ſuppreſſions of Urine too—relaxing, ſinking; weakneſſeſs, and the more immediately dangerous FEMALE COMPLAINTS—Fits, Spaſms, and Convulſions, eſpecially in children and young people—the Meaſles, Small-pox, Mortifications, nervous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive Weakneſſes—immoderate Fluxes—ſevere fits of Coughing, Suffocation or Aſthma—acute, bilious, and other Obſtructions—the Dropſy, recent ſtrokes of the Palſy, &amp;c. In theſe, and in moſt other diſeaſes, particularly in glandular and white Swellings; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, ſevere, and wandering Rheumatiſms; the rheumatic Gout; obſtinate Scurvies; in Blindneſs and in Deafneſs too, and moſt of the diſorders of thoſe moſt precious and moſt delicate organs the eye and ear, his medicines, and gentle aetherial and electrical applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, produce the moſt amazing good effects: they open obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, promote a due and regular circulation of the blood and ſpirits,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0619400100:32"/>which they ſweeten, purify, enrich, and animate; nouriſhing, bracing, and coiling up the nervous ſyſtem when weakened and relaxed; overcoming every degree of putrefaction, recruiting decayed ſtrength, and generally acting on an exhauſted body like freſh oil poured into an expiring lamp. After all, however, Dr. Graham is far from pretending to work miracles or impoſſibilities. No: he is abundantly ſenſible of the impoſſibility of curing many diſeaſes in their advanced and confirmed ſtages; and of the fallibility and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of all ſublunary things; all that he contends for is, that his methods of treating diſeaſes are far more powerful, ſafe and rational, than thoſe in general employed by any other Phyſician in the world, and that he often ſucceeds in curing effectually and laſtingly, diſeaſes internal and external, when the moſt celebrated Surgeons and Phyſicians, and even when the more friendly powers of regimen, air, exerciſe, and the beſt mineral waters have failed.</p>
            <p>So amazingly has his buſineſs increaſed, that he has <hi>now</hi> found it neceſſary, from motives of humanity more than for his own emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to fit up additional appartments, and to receive at any hour of the day ſuch ſick and lame Perſons as cannot afford to give fees for advice; and that they are now admitted daily, Sundays excepted, from eight o'clock in the morning, till eight at night, to whom advice, and all neceſſary medico-electrical operations, &amp;c. are adminiſtered <hi>gratis,</hi> in rotation, according to priority of arrival, without reſpect of perſons, paying the Apothecary for ſuch medicines only (if any) as their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive caſes require. But as the greateſt hindrances have ariſen from multitudes crowding into the TEMPLE OF HEALTH, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of attending ſick friends, but merely to gratify their curioſity, by ſtaring at the apparatus, to obviate, therefore, in future, thoſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies and impertinencies, and that as many diſeaſed perſons as poſſible may partake of the ſalutary effects of this GRAND SYSTEM OF HEALING! no poor perſon whatever will be admitted without a ticket, which muſt be had of the porter, price Half-a-Crown. This is required only at the firſt conſultation; for Dr. Graham, on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it, gives another ticket <hi>gratis,</hi> which admits the patient during the whole courſe of the cure.—No ſort of objection, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is made to <hi>one</hi> friend attending each patient—that being often neceſſary, as well as decent.</p>
            <p>The nobility, gentry, and others in genteel or eaſy circumſtances, muſt pay a Guinea the firſt conſultation, and at leaſt Half a-Guinea every time after. No perſons whomſoever, even perſonages of high rank, need expect to be attended at their own houſes, unleſs confined to bed by ſickneſs, or to their room through extreme weakneſs; and from thoſe whom he attends at their own houſes, Two Guineas the firſt, and one Guinea each viſit after, is expected. Dr. Graham, for reaſons of the higheſt importance to the public, as well as to himſelf, has a large chemical laboratory, and great medicinal cabinets in his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0619400100:33"/>own houſe; and in the above fixed fees, either at home or abroad, every expence attending his advice, medicines, applications, operations, and influences is included—a few tedious, complex, and expenſive operations in the great Apollo apartment only excepted. But in caſes where electricity or attendance are not neceſſary, and medicines are required to be taken at home, or when any are ſent into the country, if they are furniſhed and prepared by Dr. Graham's Chemiſts, or Apothecaries, they muſt be paid for ſeparately.</p>
            <p>Before he concludes this addreſs, it may not be amiſs to ſay a few words on the dangerous, and even fatal effects which may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſo mighty an agent as the electrical fire, in the hands of ignorant and raſh people. So very powerful an element cannot be indifferent when applied to the human body; it muſt do conſiderable good or conſiderable harm; ſtriking inſtances of both have repeatedly fallen under Dr. Graham's obſervations;—and he trembles with apprehenſion for his fellow-creatures, when he ſees in almoſt every ſtreet in this great metropolis, a Barber—a Surgeon—a Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawer—an Apothecary—or a common Mechanic turned electrical operator. How dangerous!—how ridiculous muſt it be in moſt caſes to venture ſo curious, ſo complex, and ſo delicate a machine as the human body, and that too, even when diſeaſed, into ſuch hands to be ſhook, torn, and convulſed with the ignorant and improper application of this awful element!</p>
            <p>For his own part, he has been taught by reaſon, and by the moſt attentive obſervations in innumerable experiments on almoſt every ſubſtance in nature, and in a courſe of practice in the cure of diſeaſes, far more extenſive than that of perhaps any other man in the world, he has been taught, that all violence is hurtful; that ELECTRICAL SHOCKS OUGHT SELDOM OR NEVER TO BE GIVEN; that partial frictions, ſparks and bruſhings, with rich me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal ſubſtances charged with electricity, or gently pervading the whole ſyſtem with a copious tide of that celeſtial fire, fully impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the pureſt, moſt ſubtile, and balmieſt parts of medicines, which are extracted by, and flow ſoftly into the blood and nervous ſyſtem, with the electrical fluid, or reſtorative aetherial eſſences. In thoſe caſes where ſhocks are abſolutely neceſſary, inſtead of charging bottles lined with tin foil, or other groſs, impure, and perhaps ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenical metals, his jars are filled with loadſtones, ſulphur, quickſilver, and with the mildeſt, yet moſt active medicinal ſubſtances from the animal, mineral, or vegetable kingdoms:—theſe are charged with the celeſtial Fire, ſolar vital Light, vivifying Air, and with the powerful, and ſalutary <hi>effluvia</hi> of oriental Balſams, aromatic Oils, Peruvian Bark, Caſtor, Camphire, Muſk, Ambergreaſe, the Balſams of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper, Peru, Tolu, and Gilead: and the influences of Electricity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Air, aetherial medicines, and magnetiſm, thus combined, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively charged with the pure celeſtial fire, or with the magnetic,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0619400100:34"/>Effluvium, are made to paſs through the whole or any particular part of the patient's body, giving, in ſuch caſes as require them, a great number or quick ſucceſſion of pleaſant little vibratory SHOCKS, ſo genial and gentle as not to hurt or alarm even an infant. But, as he ſaid before, he generally prefers the <hi>effluvia</hi> of theſe genial, aromatic, balſamic, antiſpaſmodic ſubſtances, or the <hi>effluvia</hi> of the magnetic, aërial, or aetherial eſſences, paſſing ſilently, ſweetly, and inſenſibly into the body, or confined to the ſeat or cauſe of the diſeaſe, while the ſpaſmodic tenſions and ſtiffneſſes are relaxed—or the relaxed and debilitated tone of the nerves or muſcular fibres braced up, or invigorated, as the caſe or conſtitution requires, with the above, and with properly adapted harmonious vibrations, or muſical modulations of celeſtial ſounds.</p>
            <p>Leſt it ſhould be thought that Dr. Graham uſes electricity in ALL caſes, he deſires to inform the public, that many of his greateſt and moſt extraordinary cures have been done entirely without the aſſiſtance of electricity; and that he makes it an invariable rule to reject the incurable—and to inform every patient, or their friends, at firſt fight, whether a perfect cure, or what degree of relief may be expected.</p>
            <p>Dr. Graham, after a regular, claſſical, and medical education of many years, at the juſtly celebrated univerſity of Edinburgh, and after attending to the practice in the beſt Hoſpitals, and the lectures of the greateſt Phyſicians in London, Dublin, &amp;c. became exceedingly diſſatisfied at the trifling abſurdities and feebleneſs of what is called the regular practice of Phyſic: but animated with the hopes of being able to make valuable diſcoveries, and important improvements in the cure of diſeaſes, and for the prolongation of human life, he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled into various foreign countries, making, in the courſe of twelve years, ſeveral tours thro' the continent of Europe, and over the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive provinces of America; at length, after gathering and digeſting the falreſt flowers and the choiceſt fruits of the ſciences, by converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with and attending to the labours and the lectures of the moſt learned and moſt ingenious men in every country thro' which he paſſed; after inveſtigating the nature and properties of the various natural productions, and making the moſt accurate chymical analyſes of the moſt celebrated mineral waters in Europe; he returned to Britain, and after fitting up, with infinite labour and expence, the moſt powerful, moſt uſeful, and moſt magnificent medical apparatus that ever was in the world, he has now practiſed a whole year in the metropolis of his native country, and of the world! with the greateſt honour and emolument to himſelf, and to the greateſt benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of thouſands of his fellow creatures of every rank and deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, who had laboured under pains and diſeaſes which the beſt regular practitioners, and the moſt powerful medicines in common uſe; could neither cure nor alleviate.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0619400100:35"/>
            <p>The ſame and emoluments which Dr. Graham in conſequence of his ſucceſſes in the cure of diſeaſes, is honoured with, have long ſince placed him in a ſphere which is an object of envy to the ſelfiſh and narrow-minded part of the faculty; but which neither the envy, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and mean artifices, nor the illiberal, falſe, and wicked repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, inſinuations, and libels of theatrical buffoons or of raſcally avaricious editors of news papers have been able to remove him from. Let them continue to act—to print, and to publiſh whatever their avaricious and diabolical nature prompts them to. Dr. Graham ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has, nor ever will take the leaſt notice, or anſwer one of them. No; He looks down upon them all with ſmiles of ſovereign—of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effible contempt!—What!—ſhall the genial—the life-giving Sun ceaſe to ſhine becauſe his beams offend the weak or diſtorted eyes of thoſe foul animals—thoſe vile, venomous reptiles which aſſaſſinate and devour in the dark?—Dr. G. has, at leaſt, the negative conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that thoſe villainous and lying repreſenters of things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern him, cannot treat HIM worſe than they have done his betters.—even the FIRST, moſt reſpectable, moſt innocent, and even the moſt ſacred characters in the Britiſh Dominions. The liberal and diſcerning public can readily diſtinguiſh true merit from pretended knowledge.—Facts are incontrovertible—his ſuperiority is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally acknowleged. He baſks in the ſunſhine of riches and honour. He rejoices in the applauſe of the candid and of the learned world—he exults in the teſtimony of his own conſcience,—and in the approbation of his own heart!</p>
            <p>But, in order to remove <hi>effectually</hi> every unfavourable impreſſion which the jealous and envious inſinuations of the faculty or their friends, ALARMED AT DR. GRAHAM'S UNPRECEDENTED FAME AND SUCCESS, may have created in the minds of thoſe who are unacquainted with Dr. Graham and his valuable diſcoveries and improvements; and to demonſtrate to the world at large the infinite ſuperiority of his peculiar modes of treating diſeaſes, he will continue for another year, to attend at their own home, patients in ſevere ACUTE diſeaſes, when given over for death by any other, even by the moſt celebrated Apothecary, Surgeon, or Phyſician, without any expence whatever, either for attendance, advice, or medicines, <hi>(the firſt fee only excepted)</hi> if his endeavours to preſerve life, under God! prove ineffectual. When reſtored to health his gratuity ſhall, as uſual, be regulated by the generoſity or circumſtances of the patient, <hi>No ordinary or trifling caſe will be attended to:</hi> THE ABOVE IS CONFINED TO THOSE—AND TO THOSE ALONE, WHO ARE THOUGHT TO BE NEAR DEATH IN SEVERE ACUTE DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EASES. Seldom, <hi>very ſeldom</hi> a day paſſes, but he has the bleſſedneſs of eaſing excruciating pain, and of ſnatching from the grave one or more ſick perſons, even when ſtruggling in the agonies of death, and even after they have been abandoned by the the moſt celebrated
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0619400100:36"/>Phyſicians. Indeed, ſo very amazing, ſo unprecedented has been the ſucceſs which has attended his practice, that not more than three or four perſons have died in the whole courſe or circuit of his practice during the laſt twelve months—of the multitudes who come or are brought every day to his houſe—or of thoſe whom he has been ſent for to attend, when near death, at their own habitations. While he aſſures the public of the above fact, he defies the whole world to diſprove the truth of it. Such ſueceſs is an honour of which few other Phyſicians can boaſt—a pleaſure which very few have experienced:—Nor, than the above, can any thing ſo effectually demonſtrate the infinite ſuperiority of his methods of treating diſeaſes, eſpecially as it is well known, that for ſeveral years paſt he ſeldom has had leſs than one hundred perſons every day under his care, and often more than even double that number. He may, therefore, with the Poet exclaim!</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>AS this great ſyſtem of Healing, and of encreafing the number and happineſs of the human ſpecies, which I have with ſo much labor and expence explored, and now happily confirmed, is of the higheſt importance, not only to the inhabitants of the Britiſh empire at preſent, but likewiſe to the whole human ſpecies throughout the whole earth, and perhaps for thouſands of years to come, I propoſe to continue to practiſe in this great metropolis of my native country, till the beginning of the year 1783—which will be a period of full three years—in order to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to the entire ſatisfaction of perſons of every rank, from the throne to the cottage, the facility, certainty, and, in a word, the infinite ſuperiority of my methods of propagation in difficult caſes, of preventing and curing all curable diſeaſes, external as well as internal, to which the human body is liable, and of extending life free from ſickneſs, and with the clear healthy exerciſe of the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal faculties, to the longeſt poſſible period.—At the expiration of the three years, I intend to make propoſals to the BRITISH PARLIAMENT concerning publiſhing to the world all my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, improvements, and methods of propagation, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging and curing diſeaſes, &amp;c. without any reſerve whatever; and that I may continue to communicate, from time to time, ſuch farther diſcoveries and improvements as aſſiduous inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a practice with an apparatus more potent and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive than that of any other Phyſician on the face of the globe, ſhall enable me to make.</p>
            <p>If I do not meet with that benevolence and encouragement from the LEGISLATURE of my own country, which the vaſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the object merits—I propoſe to reſide and practiſe about a year at each of the principal courts in Europe; and after that, under the royal and imperial auſpices of European wiſdom and munificence at large, I will then publiſh to mankind the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lific CODE, and SYSTEM OF HEALTH and of the HEALING ART, which I am now digeſting, compiling and perfecting as far as the experience of one age will permit—I ſay one Age, becauſe I am now eſtabliſhing a medical correſpondence in every part of the world—for the univerſal improvement and perfection of Medical and Chirurgical Science. Would to God that a Franklin, a Prieſtley, and ſeveral other great and learned men I could name, had been practiſing phyſicians, what might not be expected from the indefatigable labours of ſuch bright and penetrating intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies!</p>
            <p>In order to leſſen my fatigue in buſineſs and for the good of the public, as well as for my own private emolument, I propoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to take as pupils and aſſiſtants, three gentlemen who have had the advantages, if not of a medical, at leaſt of a liberal or claſſical education.—To prevent all trouble, the premium I I demand from each is a thouſand guineas prompt, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred guineas per ann. for board, &amp;c. while he remains in my houſe.</p>
