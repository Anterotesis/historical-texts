            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>YOUR Majeſty's having graciouſly permitted me to prefix your royal name to this tragedy, has impreſs'd me with ſo deep a ſenſe of the honor, that I deſpair of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terms ſufficient to expreſs my acknowledgments.</p>

Having omitted nothing in my power to render it not entirely unworthy of ſuch an exalted patronage, I can't forbear to flatter myſelf, that it may raiſe in the breaſt of your Majeſty thoſe emotions which well imagined di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs never fails to excite in the nobleſt natures: but at the ſame time I more anxiouſly wiſh, that no other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs but from ſuch fictitious ſorrow may ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach you; and that the greateſt and moſt amiable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign in Europe, may be alſo for ever diſtinguiſhed as the moſt proſperous and happy.</p>

               <l>HARD is the taſk, in modern days to chooſe,</l>
               <l>Congenial ſubjects for the tragic muſe:</l>
               <l>The hiſtorian's page, the fertile epic ſtore,</l>
               <l>Were known, and ranſack'd centuries before:</l>
               <l>Like luſcious gardens, unenclos'd they lay,</l>
               <l>To ev'ry ſaunt'ring bard an eaſy prey.</l>
               <l>They enter'd, and, as taſte impell'd, they fed</l>
               <l>On Homer ſome, and ſome on Hollingſhead.</l>
               <l>From loftieſt numbers, or from humbleſt proſe,</l>
               <l>As each conſpir'd, the artleſs ſtructures roſe.</l>
               <l>Thus one great labour of their work was o'er,</l>
               <l>They found a fable, and they fought no more.</l>
               <l>Careleſs were they of action, place, or time,</l>
               <l>Whoſe only toil was dialogue and rhyme.</l>
               <l>"Rules which the rigid Stagyrite devis'd,</l>
               <l>"Our fathers knew not, or, if known, deſpis'd.</l>
               <l>Whilſt ſide by ſide, were mingled in the ſcene,</l>
               <l>A laughing ruſtic, and a weeping queen.</l>
               <l>Space was obedient to the boundleſs piece,</l>
               <l>That op'd in Mexico, and clos'd in Greece.</l>
               <l>Then thick with plots the crowded tale was ſown,</l>
               <l>'Till the divided boſom felt for none;</l>
               <l>"They fear'd no cenſures of a frowning pit,</l>
               <l>"That judg'd as looſely as the authors writ."</l>
               <l>But we, who poſted in time's tardy rear,</l>
               <l>Before a learn'd tribunal now appear;</l>
               <l>With anxious art a fable muſt deſign,</l>
               <l>Where probability, and intereſt join:</l>
               <l>Where time, and place, and action, all agree</l>
               <l>To violate no ſacred unity.</l>
               <l>And thus each candid critic muſt confeſs</l>
               <l>The labour greater, and indulgence leſs;</l>
               <l>When ſuch the taſk, the wonder is to meet,</l>
               <l>Not many pieces bad, but one complete.</l>
               <l>Nor let preſumptious poets fondly claim</l>
               <l>From rules exemption, by great Shakeſpeare's name;</l>
               <l>Though comets move with wild excentric force,</l>

               <l>Again ſalutes you from a neighbouring ſhore.</l>

               <l>OF all the Gothic laws I ever heard,</l>
               <l>This Lombard Law was ſure the moſt abſurd:</l>
               <l>What! could the monſters mean to make us die,</l>
               <l>But for a little harmleſs gallantry?</l>
               <l>Were ſuch a barbarous cuſtom now in faſhion,</l>
               <l>Good Lord! it would unpeople half the nation.</l>
               <l>Scaffolds on ſcaffolds now the ſtreets would fill,</l>
               <l>As ſign-poſts did, before the paving-bill.</l>
               <l>Were Britiſh law-makers ſuch rigorous churls,</l>
               <l>They'd hardly leave a head to wear falſe curls.</l>
               <l>Beſides, what champion now would riſque his life,</l>
               <l>To gain what moſt men ſhudder at—a wife.</l>
               <l>Inſtead of arm'd knights, at trumpet's ſummons,</l>
               <l>Commend me to our proctors, and the Commons.</l>
               <l>There, though we loſe our huſbands, and our fame,</l>
               <l>We get our portion, and a maiden name.</l>
               <l>And if her fortune, and her charms remain,</l>
               <l>Then Miſs may wed—and be divorc'd again.</l>
               <l>Yet, though theſe frolics have of late been common,</l>
               <l>Lay not the blame entirely on weak woman.</l>
               <l>The careleſs mate his rival recommends,</l>
               <l>We find him 'midſt his own obliging friends.</l>
               <l>Some ſwain, who ſwears he lives but in our eyes,</l>
               <l>And plies us with ſuch cunning flatteries,</l>
               <l>That ſpouſe neglecting us, and lover wooing,</l>
               <l>One ſtrives, and t'other leads us, to our ruin.</l>
               <l>So, if weak ladies, chance to go aſtray,</l>
               <l>Their lords, methinks, are more in fault than they:</l>
               <l>The goal of marriage reach'd, the men lie down,</l>
               <l>Like weary racers when the prize is won;</l>
               <l>Mere catching us alone their care engages;</l>
               <l>The nets they ſpread, but never mind the cages.</l>
               <l>The married gameſter more delight can find,</l>
               <l>In "Seven's the main," than all dear womankind.</l>
               <l>Acteon wedded, to our voice prefers</l>
               <l>The ſweeter muſic of his yelping ours;</l>
               <l>While the dull ſot, who his ſix bottles boaſts,</l>
               <l>Thinks women good for nothing—but for toaſts.</l>
               <l>Thus ſlighted for the glaſs, the hound, the die,</l>
               <l>Our pride ſteps in, and to revenge we fly;</l>
               <l>One obvious method only can preſerve us,</l>
               <l>Strive, by your own attentions, to deſerve us;</l>
               <l>And now, as formerly, be ſure you'll prove,</l>
               <l>Contempt will meet contempt, as love meets love.</l>
