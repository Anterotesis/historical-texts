            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

met a gentleman, whom I had known at ſchool, his ſiſter was my friend and favourite there, and, in my childiſh days, he uſed to call himſelf my lover.—Even then I thought him, as ſure he is this moment, the moſt amiable of his ſex.</p>

At ſight of him, my terror and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion redoubled. I ran down ſtairs into the ſtreet, without knowing whither I went, or what to do. The night coach was ſetting off for London, at that moment; I got into it, without determining on any thing, but that I wou'd not return; and hither it has brought me.</p>

                  <p>My dear ſiſter, let me diſſuade you from carrying on this affair with Mr. Freeman any farther; if he really loves you, and his family and fortune may pretend to ſuch a match, why not conſult my brother? who has an undoubted right to be conſidered as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from having acted on all occaſions like one.</p>

                  <p>You have very vulgar notions, ſiſter; I ſuppoſe if you ſhou'd ever have a lover, you will bid him aſk your parents whether you ſhall like him or not?—poor ſoul! but is it aunt Bridget, or uncle Frank, he ſhall apply to? ha, ha! Do you know, my dear, that as well as I love my Strephon, if he were to ſay one ſyllable about me to my grave brother, it is an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to one, I ſhou'd deteſt him. Secrecy is the very eſſence of love, and like all other eſſences, it will eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, the moment it gets air.</p>

                  <p>I am ſorry to differ ſo much in opinion with you, Louiſa, but I can't help thinking that the moſt innocent correſpondence, which can poſſibly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt between men and women, becomes in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree criminal, when it is carried on clandeſtinely; at leaſt, it muſt appear as if one party was aſham'd of the other, which you muſt allow to be a ſentiment, by no means conſiſtent with heroic love.</p>

But in ſhort, Maria, I begin to think this wiſe brother of ours has his failings, like other men, and growing indolent, as they all do, chuſes to bring his favourites near home: did you obſerve with what an enquiring eye he looked at you?

What the denoüement will be on her part, I cannot gueſs, but am determin'd it ſhall not conclude in the uſual ſtile with me; for, from this hour, I diſclaim all future thoughts of a ſerious connection with any of the ſex.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>Is it poſſible, Sir Charles, that paſſion can ſo far triumph over reaſon, as in one moment to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the good opinion of a character, form'd on a long acquaintance? You ſay you knew the lady from her childhood?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>My dear Belmont, you have ſtated this argument quite wrong, it was not paſſion that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd over reaſon, but reaſon that ſubdued paſſion. I can now ſee, nay feel, what an abject wretch he muſt be, who truſts his happineſs in a woman's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er—damn'd, ſmiling miſchiefs, all!—I will, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, ſee, and admire the pretty baubles, as I wou'd a fine piece of china, but no more attribute worth and honour to them, than maleability to that; for if my Emily cou'd deceive, there is no truth in woman.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>This is mere common-place, Sir Charles.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>By calling it common, my lord, you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it the general ſenſe of mankind, which is, no doubt, founded on experience. I am therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to profit by it, ſo far as to retain my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at leaſt. I think I almoſt feel the ſhackles I might have worn, but for the old gentleman's refuſal.—Oh! how I thank him!</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>Certainly the greateſt, tho' his refuſal then was daggers to my heart.—Fool that I was, I thought her what ſhe ſeem'd, an angel; and, but for him, Ixion like, I had embrac'd a cloud. But why do I ſtill talk, or think of her! ſhe is not worth a thought, and I hope to get quite clear of her idea, before I reach Harwich.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>Believe me, you deceive yourſelf; her form will haunt you, fly where'er you will, and for the ſame reaſon that murderers fancy ghoſts—for I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you have injur'd her.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>What ſhall I not believe my eyes! by heaven, the conſciouſneſs of her guilt even conquer'd female fear; ſhe threw herſelf upon a madman's ſword, ſuch I then was; but 'twas to ſave her lover, and my rival; ungrateful woman!</p>

                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſeem inclin'd to lay hold of the dark ſide of every circumſtance; but there is one you ſeem not yet to have attended to, or you cou'd not think of leaving England immediately. May not the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, you encounter'd in your miſtreſs's chamber, poſſibly ſuppoſe you fled from him?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Cha.</speaker>
                  <p>That thought had quite eſcap'd me. I left a ſervant behind, whom I expect this night, in order to diſcover who my rival was; and alſo to find out what her father had done, or meant to do, with his unworthy, yet too lovely daughter: I fear he will uſe her cruelly, my lord.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, faith, my lord, I have always look'd upon chivalry as a very ridiculous ſcience, and yet I begin to think it has its foundation in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for I never yet heard of a damſel in diſtreſs, that I did not wiſh to relieve her.</p>

                  <p>Sir Charles, this affair is much too ſerious to jeſt with. You have aſked my opinion, and, as a man of honour, and your friend, I now declare, I think your travelling ſcheme ſhou'd be entirely laid aſide, until this myſtery is properly explain'd.

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>There again, your lordſhip is guilty of a ſmall error, only miſtaking the paſt for the preſent tenſe; ſay I did love her, if you pleaſe.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, Sir Charles, grant you no longer love, you are certainly a man of honour, and muſt therefore think it incumbent on you to clear a lady's character, which may poſſibly have ſuffered as much on your account, in the minds of others, as ſhe has done in yours, from this unlucky accident.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>Wou'd to heaven that I cou'd clear her to my own heart, from all ſuſpicion, with as much juſtice, as I can to the world, of what relates to me; in her whole conduct and behaviour towards me, ſhe was purity herſelf, her ſoul ſeem'd even lovelier than her form, and caſt a kind of glory round her beauty, which, while it awed, tranſported, raiſed, and chaſtis'd deſire—yet ſhe is falſe!</p>

                  <p>I know not how to act in this affair; if her father ſhou'd diſcover her being here, I have no right to detain her. This unknown lover too puzzles me much. Somerville is poſitive he came to her, and yet with what an air of truth and confidence ſhe has diſown'd him! I'll make her think that Somerville is gone; ſhe may, from that belief, become more candid.</p>

                  <p>Not know the perſon, whom I this very hour ſaw come out of your houſe, by the back-door that leads into your garden?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>You muſt miſtake. Sir Charles, it cannot be.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>Do I know you, am I awake, or in my ſenſes? If theſe things are true, I ſurely ſaw him iſſue from your garden-door; his image is too ſtrongly fix'd upon my wounded memory, to think I can miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; the moon ſhone bright upon him.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>My dear Lord Belmont, if I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd you, by imagining you to be this unknown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's friend, therefore no longer mine, what apology, what atonement can I make?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, Sir Charles, you have wrong'd both truth and friendſhip; I never had a friend I dared to injure, or diſclaim; yet, if it was not a viſion that you ſaw, you are in ſome degree excuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able—yet, why ſhou'd he come here?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>That is indeed a myſtery—but as I cou'd not imagine he came to any one within theſe walls, except your lordſhip, I hope you'll pardon the frenzy of a man who thought himſelf aggriev'd in the moſt tender points, his love and friendſhip.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir Charles, your ſeeming motives for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment were ſo ſtrong, that I can readily forget the effects—I hope we are friends again—but let the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0058402400:41"/>
conviction of your preſent error lead you to doubt, at leaſt, the certainty of ſome former appearances.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>O, my too generous friend! let me be happy ſtill in your eſteem, but baniſh from my mind all thoughts of love. Her guilt is fully proved; ſhe fled, that fatal night, from Bath, with her ſeducer. Curſes blaſt him!</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>My ſervant is return'd, and brings this ſad account; he left her poor unhappy father ſetting out in purſuit of—I cannot name her, my once lovely Emily.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>In ſuch a ſcene of complicated diſtreſs, may ſhe not have fled for refuge to ſome friend? Why will you think the worſt?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>O no, my lord, ſhe had no friend to fly to; for ſure he is the worſt of foes, as well as vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, that wou'd deſtroy her innocence. I doubt not but the wretch may abandon her to want and infamy.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot think that ſhe is in his power. It is improbable that a well-educated maid ſhou'd take ſo raſh a ſtep, but on a certainty of marriage with the man ſhe lov'd.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſhou'd rejoice to think as you do; and were there but the ſlighteſt foundation for hope, wou'd gladly reſt upon it. But all my doubts are at an end; I am therefore determined to quit England. but not 'till I have found the man, who has robbed me of my peace, and Emily. I'll go this moment in purſuit of him.</p>

And Mrs. Southerne, let me tell your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is a parlous wiſe woman, and never was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in her whole life; at leaſt, I never thought her in the wrong, and therefore never contradicted her.</p>

                  <p>And ſo ſhe has, my lord. I, like a careful father, as I was, and in regard to her poor mother's memory, provided a proper and convenient match for her; my neighbour Winterbottom, my lord, a man pretty near my own age, one that was fit to conduct and manage ſuch a raw, headſtrong chit, as ſhe; a diſcreet perſon, let me tell you; and a great favourite of Mrs. Southerne's.</p>

                  <p>Why not, why not, my lord, ſhe made no objection to his years, but truly ſhe diſlik'd his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and perſon, becauſe he was not a fine ſmock-fac'd beau, and cou'd not trace his pedigree up to Adam, forſooth; a conceited undutiful minx as ſhe was.</p>

                  <p>I cannot blame my couſin's ſpirit, ſir; her birth, youth, and fortune, entitle her to a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent match; but were ſhe a beggar, ſir, ſhe had better ſerve, to earn her bread, than wed the man ſhe hates.</p>

                  <p>No, no, I was too tender of her; when ſhe got into the pouts, and cry'd and roar'd, I promiſed not to force her to this marriage; but if ſhe wou'd be a dutiful child, and conſent to it, I wou'd take her with me to Bath; ſhe promis'd ſhe wou'd try to obey me, and, in an ill hour, to Bath I brought her.</p>

                  <p>Worſe, much worſe than that: ſhe ſent a fine ſpark, a baronet, I think he was, to aſk her for his wife, tho' ſhe knew very well, that Mrs. Southerne
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0058402400:44"/>

                  <p>Pray don't interrupt me, my lord, and you ſhall hear how this gentle lady behaved.—About eleven that night, when I was ſmoking my pipe, I heard her ſquall; I ran into her chamber, and there I found the knight, and another of her lovers, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, tilting at each other; I beat down their paſſes with my crutch, the candle fell to the ground, and before the ſervants could bring light, madam and all were fled.</p>

                  <p>Not a ſyllable, nor wou'd I ever have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired about her, but that my lady's honour is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to Winterbottom.

                  <p>You'll pardon me, Louiſa, if I pronounce it much more indelicate for a young lady to receive the addreſſes of a lover privately, than if authorized by the approbation of her friends: in this caſe, her compliance might appear a condeſcenſion to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; in the other, it looks too much like granting an indulgence to her own.</p>

                  <p>I am ſurpriz'd, my lord, that among ſuch a variety of miſtreſſes, he never found one that wou'd marry him; his perſon muſt have been tolerable, when he was young; his family and fortune unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable.</p>

                  <p>Be aſſur'd, ſiſter, that was not the caſe; but by the time he had brought the lady to think favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably of him, he began to diſcover ſome imperfection in her. Perhaps her noſe was a hair's breadth longer or ſhorter than it ſhou'd be, according to the exact rules of proportion; a foot, or a finger, perhaps, diſguſted him; on which, he immediately quitted his purſuit, and went in ſearch of another model.</p>

                  <p>Well then, I grant, that while beauty laſts, it will always have admirers. But theſe, Louiſa, are but pageants to a conqueror; the triumph muſt be found at home, in the heartfelt love and eſteem of a man of ſenſe and honour.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>L. Loui.</speaker>
                  <p>True, my lord, but that ſame beauty, that cauſes admiration and attention in other men, will neceſſarily preſerve our huſband's love.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>By no means, Louiſa; poſſeſſion damps the ardor of deſire; merit alone can keep the flame alive, and hinder every wanton gale from blowing it abroad; that, like the veſtal fire, muſt be preſerv'd by conſtant watching.</p>

                  <p>I will allow her taſk is full as arduous, tho' more pleaſing. Men are naturally inconſtant; and a huſband may ſometimes ſee a woman fairer than his wife; but 'tis her fault, if in the whole circle, he can find one that ſo well deſerves his love; whoſe temper, manners, conduct, and behaviour, are ſo much ſuited to his ſentiments; who knows no wiſh or will, but to pleaſe him—theſe charms, the homelieſt woman may acquire; without them, the faireſt form that ever ſtruck our eyes, cannot retain one heart.</p>

            <byline>Sent by a Perſon unknown.</byline>
            <stage>Spoken by Miſs WILFORD, in the character of Lady LOUISA.</stage>
            <lg>
               <l>I Had an Epilogue to ſpeak to night,</l>
               <l>But I'm ſo hurried, put in ſuch a fright,</l>
               <l>Deuce take me!—if I ha'nt forgot it quite.</l>
               <l>To ſee my name in firſt night's play-bill printed,</l>
               <l>A character quite new, in time quite ſtinted;</l>
               <l>An Epilogue, beſides, to get by heart,</l>
               <l>'Tis moſt unmerciful, too long a part—</l>
               <l>But they ſo coax'd and wheedled me to duty,</l>
               <l>Leſt I ſhould fret—for fretting ſpoils one's beauty,</l>
               <l>That, in obedience to the kind command,</l>
               <l>A ſuppliant to your favour, here I ſtand:</l>
               <l>And hope, inſtead of what had been prepar'd,</l>
               <l>Some nonſenſe of my own, may now be heard.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Well! I have had a great eſcape, I own,</l>
               <l>From being made the jeſt of all the town;</l>
               <l>For from the court end I could claim no pity,</l>
               <l>Nor had I more to hope for, from the city;</l>
               <l>Such matches rarely anſwer either ſide,</l>
               <l>For induſtry is ſuited ill with pride.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But, to divert your cenſure, let me ſhew</l>
               <l>A folly more compleat, a city beau!</l>
               <l>What contraſt can there be ſo ſtrong in nature,</l>

               <l>May wait, 'till all my dancing days are over!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Next, ſhift the ſcene—behold a virtuoſo!</l>
               <l>An old illiterate, feeble amoroſo!</l>
               <l>What weakneſs can the human heart diſcover,</l>
               <l>More ſhameful, than a climacteric lover?</l>
               <l>Men, who have turn'd the period of threeſcore,</l>
