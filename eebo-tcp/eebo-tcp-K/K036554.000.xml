            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE attention you have vouchſafed to the Counteſs of Saliſbury and the Author, ever ſince they have had the honour of being known to your Ladyſhip, perſuades me that you will take pleaſure in hearing it has been favourably received on the Engliſh Theatre. Stript now of all ſtage decoration, and the aſſiſtance which it has hitherto received from the moſt animated performance, it is to undergo a ſtricter ſcrutiny, that of the cloſet; a ſcrutiny for which it is indeed but little provided. I know your Ladyſhip will make a tender allowance for want of experience in the Author, and ſuch errors as are incident to human inperfection; but this is an indulgence, which I doubt the critic will not ſo readily ſhew him. But however he may cenſure, I muſt ever think myſelf happy in having already acquired your Ladyſhip's good opinions. I am alſo flattered, as often as I think of the near reſemblance my Heroine has of your Ladyſhip. Had I been earlier honoured with your Ladyſhip's acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I think I could have much enlarged the
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0380900700:3"/>
character. And yet there are many virtues, many delicacies, which it would have been impoſſible for me to have preſerved in the picture, of which thoſe only can be truly ſenſible, who have the happineſs of being acquainted with the Original.</p>
            <p>Pleaſe, Madam, to accept the following attempt, as an offering of my gratitude for many favours; an imperfect indeed, but honeſt proof, of the eſteem, which is due from,</p>

            <p>THE COUNTESS OF SALISBURY made her appearance about two years ago in Ireland, where ſhe was received with very ſingular marks of favour; the Author there had many friends, and with all the partiality they might be ſuppoſed to have for him, thoſe friends did not heſitate to declare, that the excellent performance of Mrs. Dancer and Mr. Barry, contributed largely to the ſucceſs of the Piece: written in his early youth, without having much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſtage, or dramatic performances, the Author is ſenſible what his Tragedy muſt be, notwithſtanding the ſmiles with which it has been indulged. England, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the character of good nature and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity which it has eſtabliſhed through all the world, has kindly followed the example of its ſiſter nation, and received with an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence the attempt of a young Writer, who is indeed ambitious of pleaſing, but dare not aſpire to excellence. He attributes, in great meaſure, his good fortune now, to what his friends attributed it before, the animated performance of Mrs. Dancer and Mr. Barry: it is theirs to endeavour to ſupport a reputation already gained, his to aim at improvement, in order to acquire one.</p>

            <l>Upon my ſoul now I don't take it well in you:</l>
            <l>Arra, be eaſy, till I'm after telling you:</l>
            <l>Smit with the love of glory and of pelf,</l>
            <l>To night, a bard from Dublin its ownſelf,</l>
            <l>Has brought a play here for your approbation,</l>
            <l>A very pretty thing by my ſalvation—</l>

            <l>The Counteſs is a mighty honeſt girl;</l>
            <l>But there's a villain with a damn'd cramp'd name,</l>
            <l>Makes ſuch propoſhals—'tis a burning ſhame—</l>
            <l>Another too—a Knight—bekeys as why—</l>
            <l>But hould you know, you'll ſee it by and by,</l>
            <l>And then 'tis time enough to tell the plot.</l>

            <l>The dreſſes—'Pon my conſcience in my days</l>
            <l>I never ſaw their peer, they're all a blaze.</l>
            <l>Then there's a child, the ſweeteſt little rogue—</l>
            <l>Only excuſe a trifling ſpice of brogue—</l>
