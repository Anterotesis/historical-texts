            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THAT ſome Diſeaſes are properly the Effects of the Influence of the heavenly Bodies, and that others do vary their Periods and Symptoms according to the different Poſitions of one or other of thoſe luminous Globes, is a very antient and certain Obſervation. Upon this Score <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Epiſt. ad Theſſalum Filium.</note> adviſes his Son <hi>Theſſalus</hi> to the Study of Geometry and Numbers, becauſe <hi>the Knowledge of the Stars is of very great Uſe in Phyſick</hi>

            <p>But when in later Times Medicine came to be accommodated to the Reaſonings of Philoſophers;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0682502100:3"/>no body being able to account for the Manner of this celeſtial Action, it was allowed no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Share in affecting our Health, than what might be imputed to the Changes in the manifeſt Conſtitution of the Air, excepting perhaps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Truth which ſtill remains diſguiſed and blended with the Jargon of judiciary Aſtrology.</p>
            <p>In order therefore to ſet this Matter in a little clearer Light, I ſhall in the firſt Place ſhew, That the Sun and Moon regarding their Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Direction to the Earth only, beſides the Effects of Heat, Moiſture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thereby cauſed in our Atmoſphere, muſt at certain Times make ſome Alterations in all Animal Bodies; then enumerate ſome Hiſtories and Obſervations of ſuch Changes, and enquire of what Uſe ſuch Thoughts as theſe may be in the Practice of Phyſick.</p>
            <p>It is a conſtant Obſervation of thoſe who write the Hiſtory of the <hi>Winds,</hi> That the moſt windy Seaſons of the Year, are the Time about the Vernal and Autumnal Equinox; for be the Air never ſo calm before or after, we never fail of having Winds at that Juncture. Every body likewiſe knows, that in the moſt quiet Weather we are ſure of ſome Breeze at Mid-day and Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, as alſo at full Sea, <hi>i. e.</hi> always about the Time the Sun or Moon arrive at the Meridian. Seamen and Country People reckon upon this, and order their Affairs accordingly. And the Changes of the Weather as to Winds or Calms eſpecially about the new and full Moon, are too well known to require any Authority to confirm ſuch Remarks. Thoſe who deſire a fuller Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe Obſervations, may ſee it in <hi>De Chales</hi>'s Navigation, <hi>Gaſſendus</hi>'s Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and <hi>J. Goad,</hi> his <hi>Aſtro-Meteoro-Logica.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0682502100:4"/>
            <p>Theſe Things being Matters of Fact, and in a Manner regular and univerſal, it may very well ſeem ſtrange that Philoſophers have not been more accurate in their Enquiries into the Reaſon of ſuch Appearances. True indeed it is, that the Origin of Winds is various and uncertain, but however, ſo conſtant and uniform an Effect muſt undoubtedly be owing to one neceſſary Cauſe.</p>
            <p>It has been, now a conſiderable Time ſince, ſufficiently made out, that our Atmoſphere is a thin elaſtic Fluid, one Part of which gravitates upon another, and whoſe Preſſure is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated every Way in a Sphere to any given Part thereof. From hence it follows, That if by any external Cauſe the Gravity of any one Part ſhou'd be taken off or diminiſhed, that from all ſides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round this Part, the more heavy Air would ruſh in to reſtore the Equilibrium which muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be preſerved in all Fluids. Now this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent running in of the heavier Air would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produce a Wind, which is no more than a ſtrong Motion of the Air in ſome determined Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. If therefore we can find any outward Cauſe that would at theſe ſtated Seaſons we have mentioned, diminiſh the Weight or Preſſure of the Atmoſphere; we ſhall have the genuine Reaſon of theſe periodical Winds, and the neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences thereof.</p>
            <p>The Flux and Reflux of the Sea was a Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon too viſible, and too much conducing to the Subſiſtance of Mankind, and all other Animals, to be neglected by thoſe who applied themſelves to the Study of Nature; however all their Attempts to explain this admirable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of infinite Wiſdom were unſucceſsful, till Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> reveal'd to the World juſter Principles, and by a truer Philoſophy than was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0682502100:5"/>formerly known, ſhew'd us how by the united or divided Forces of the Sun and Moon, which are encreaſed and leſſened by ſeveral Circumſtances, all the Varieties of the Tides are to be accounted for. And ſince all the Changes we have enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the Atmoſphere do fall out at the ſame Times when thoſe happen in the Ocean; and likewiſe whereas both the Waters of the Sea and the Air of our Earth, are Fluids ſubject, in a great Meaſure, to the ſame Laws of Motion; it is plain, that the Rule of our great Philoſopher takes place here, <hi>viz. That natural Effects of the ſame kind are owing to the ſame Cauſes</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Newton. <hi>Princip. p.</hi> 402.</note>.</p>
            <p>What Difference that known Property of the Air, which is not in Water, makes in the Caſe, I ſhall ſhew anon; ſetting aſide the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that for the preſent; It is certain, That as the Sea is, ſo muſt our Air, twice every 25 Hours, be raiſed upwards to a conſiderable Height, by the Attraction of the Moon coming to the Meridian; ſo that inſtead of a <hi>Spherical,</hi> it muſt form itſelf into a <hi>Spheroidal,</hi> or <hi>Oval</hi> Figure, whoſe longeſt Diameter being produced, would paſs thro' the Moon. That the like raiſing muſt form itſelf into a <hi>Spheroidal,</hi> or <hi>Oval</hi> Figure, whoſe longeſt Diameter being produced, would paſs thro' the Moon. That the like raiſing muſt follow as often as the Sun is in the Meridian of any Place, either above or below the Horizon. Moreover, That this Elevation is <hi>greateſt</hi> upon the new and full Moons, becauſe both Sun and Moon do then conſpire in their Attraction; <hi>leaſt</hi> on the Quarters, in that they then drawing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Ways, 'tis only the Difference of their Actions produces the Effect. Laſtly, That this Intumeſcence will be of a <hi>middle Degree,</hi> at the Time between the Quarters, and new and full Moon.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0682502100:6"/>
            <p>From the ſame Principles, the Motion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the Air will be ſtrongeſt of all about the Equinoxes; the Equinoctial Line being over that Circle of the Globe, which has the greateſt Diameter, either of the Luminaries when in that are nearer, and the Agitation of the Fluid Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roid revolving about a greater Circle, is greater; beſides, the centrifugal Force (ariſing from the diurnal Rotation) is there greateſt of all. This will ſtill be more conſiderable about the new and full Moons happening at theſe Times, for the Reaſons juſt now mentioned. And the leaſt Attraction will be about the Quadratures of theſe Lunar Months, becauſe the Declination of the Moon from the Equator is then greateſt. The different Diſtances of the Moon in her Perigaeum and Apogaeum, are the Reaſon that theſe full Changes fall out a little before the Vernal, and after the Autumnal Equinox. Now the Inverſe of all this happens when the Luminaries are in the Solſtitial Circles. Laſtly, In the ſame Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, when the Moon's Declination is towards the elevated Pole, the Attraction is ſtrongeſt when the Moon is in that Place's Meridian, and weakeſt when ſhe is in the oppoſite Place's Meridian: The contrary happens in the oppoſite Parallel; by reaſon of the ſpheroidal Figure of the Earth and its Atmoſphere.</p>
            <p>Whatever has been ſaid on this Head, is no more than applying what Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated of the Sea to our Atmoſphere; and it is needleſs to ſhew how neceſſarily thoſe Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, juſt now mentioned of <hi>Winds,</hi> at the ſtated Times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt happen hereupon. It will be of more uſe to conſider the Proportion of the Forces of the two Luminaries upon the <hi>Air,</hi> to that which they have upon the Water of our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0682502100:7"/>Globe; that it may the more plainly appear what Influence the Alterations hereby made, muſt have upon the Animal Body.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> has demonſtrated,
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Princip. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Prop.</hi> 36.</note> That the Force of the Sun to move the Sea, is to the Force of Gravity, as 1 to 12868200. Let that be

               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>And ſince the centrifugal Force of the Parts of the Earth ariſing from its diurnal Motion is to Gravity, as 1 to 291. Let this be <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>

            </p>
            <p>The ſame Philoſopher has taught us
<note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Ibid. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Prop.</hi> 37.</note> that the centrifugal Force raiſes the Water at the Equator above the Water at the Poles, to the Height of 85200 Feet. Wherefore if that Force which is as 6031, raiſes the Ocean to 85200 Feet, the united Forces of the Sun and Moon, which are as 1. will raiſe the ſame to 14 Feet, for 85200<expan>

            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0682502100:8"/>
            <p>Now we know that the more eaſily the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can obey the Attraction, with the more Force are the Tides moved; but ſince, as Mr. <hi>Halley</hi> has determin'd it,
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Philoſ. Tranſ.</hi> No. 181.</note> our Atmoſphere is extended to 45 Miles, whereas the middle Depth of the Ocean is but about half a Mile; it is plain, that the Air revolving in a Sphere about 100 Times larger than that of the Ocean, will have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably greater Agitation.</p>
            <p>Beſides; Rocks, Shelves, and the Inequality of Shoars are a great Stop to the Acceſs and Receſs of the Sea: But nothing repels the riſing Air, whic his alſo of ſuch Thinneſs and Fluidity, that it is eaſily driven, and runs every Way.</p>
            <p>Nor ought we to omit, that it is the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Law of Bodies attracted, that the Force of Attraction is reciprocally as the Squares of their Diſtances; ſo that the Action of the Sun and Moon will be greater upon the Air than upon the Water, upon the Account of its Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>But the Conſideration of the Elaſticity is ſtill of greater Moment here, of which this is the Nature, that it is reciprocally as the Preſſure, ſo that the incumbent Weight being diminiſhed by the Attraction, the Air underneath will upon this Score be mightily expanded.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like Cauſes will make the Tides in the Air to be much greater than thoſe of the Ocean; nor is it neceſſary to our purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, by nice Calculations, their particular Forces; it is ſufficient to have proved that theſe Motions muſt both be univerſal, and alſo return at certain Intervals.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0682502100:9"/>
            <p>Now ſince the raiſing of the Water of the Ocean 14 Feet, produces Torrents of ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Force, we may eaſily conceive what Tempeſts of Winds (if not otherwiſe check'd) the Elevation of the Air much higher (perhaps above a Mile) will neceſſarily cauſe. And there is no doubt to be made, but that the ſame infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wiſe Being who contrived the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, to ſecure that vaſt Collection of Waters from Stagnation and Corruption (which would inevitably deſtroy all the Animals and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables on this Globe) has ordered this Ebb and Flood of the Air of our Atmoſphere, with the like good Deſign, that is to preſerve (in Caſe all other Cauſes ſhould fail, as they may, and at Times do in ſome Countries) the ſweet Freſhneſs, and briſk Temper of this Fluid, ſo neceſſary to Life, and keep it, by a kind of continual Circulation, from Deadneſs and Stinking.</p>
            <p>This Reaſoning is liable to only one Objection that I know of, and that is this: That the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances we have mentioned cannot be owing to the Cauſes now aſſigned; ſince by Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from them, the Mercury muſt at new and full Moon ſubſide in the Barometer to a certain Degree, which yet we do not obſerve to happen.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to which, (beſides that there have been ſome Obſervations made of the ſinking of the Mercury at thoſe Times; and it may perhaps be the Fault of the Obſervers that theſe have not been reduced to any Rule) we are to conſider, That altho' Winds and Alterations in the Preſſure of the Atmoſphere, are the neceſſary Conſequents of the lunar Attraction, and true Cauſes of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Riſe of the Mercury in the Barometer; yet theſe may be produced many other ways too, and therefore tho' regularly the Mercury would always
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0682502100:10"/>fall at the new and full Moon, thoſe other Cauſes may be ſtrong enough, even to raiſe it at thoſe Seaſons; in as much as two contrary Winds, for Inſtance, blowing towards the Place of Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may accumulate the Air there, ſo as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe both the Height and Weight of the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent Cylinder; in like Manner, the Direction of two Winds may be ſuch, as meeting at a certain Angle they may keep the Gravity of the Air in the middle Place unalter'd; and a Thouſand ſuch Varieties there may be, by which the Regularity of Appearances of this Nature may be hinder'd. Now the other Springs, from which ſuch Changes in the Air may ariſe, are theſe;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Elaſtic Vapours forc'd from the Bowels of the Earth, by ſubterraneous Heats, and condenſed by whatever Cauſe in the Atmoſphere.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Mixture of Effluvia of different Qualities in the Air, may by Rarefactions, Fermentations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> produce Winds and other Effects like thoſe reſulting from the Combination of ſome Chymical Liquors; and that ſuch Things happen, we are aſſur'd from the Nature of Thunder, Lightning, and Meteors.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the Eruptions of Vulcanoes and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes in diſtant Places, Winds may be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to remoter Countries.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The divided or united Forces of the other Planets and of Comets, may variouſly diſturb the Influence of the Sun and Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We know that there happen violent Tempeſts in the upper Regions of the Air, while we below enjoy a Calm; and how many Ridges of Mountains there are on our Globe, which interrupt and check the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Winds; ſo that it is no wonder that the Phaenomena we have aſcribed to the Action of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0682502100:11"/>the Sun and Moon, are not always conſtant and uniform, and that every Effect does not hereupon follow; which, were there no other Powers in Nature able to alter the Influence of this, might in a very regular and uniform Manner be expected from it.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things being premiſed, it will not be difficult to ſhew (as was propoſed in the firſt Place) that theſe Changes in our Atmoſphere at high Water, new and full Moon, the Equinoxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt occaſion ſome Alterations in all Animal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and that from the following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All living Creatures require Air of a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd Gravity to perform Reſpiration eaſily, and with Advantage; for it is by its Weight that this Fluid inſinuates itſelf into the Cavity of the Breaſt and Lungs. Now the Gravity, as we have prov'd, being leſſen'd at theſe Seaſons, a ſmaller Quantity only will inſinuate itſelf, and this muſt be of ſmaller Force to comminute the Blood, and forward its Paſſage into the left Ventricle of the Heart, whence a ſlower Circulation inſues, and the Secretion of the Spirits is diminiſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Effect will be the more ſure, in that the Elaſticity of the Atmoſphere is likewiſe diminiſh'd. Animals want Air as heavy ſo elaſtic to a certain Degree; for as this is by its Weight forced into the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax</hi> in Inſpiration, ſo the Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> preſs it into the <hi>Bronchi</hi> in Expiration, where the bending Force being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what taken off, and ſpringy Bodies when unbended, exerting their Power every Way, in Proportion to their Preſſures, the Parts of the Air puſh againſt all the Sides of the <hi>Veſiculae,</hi> and promote the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Blood.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0682502100:12"/>
            <p>We have a convincing Inſtance of all this, in thoſe who go to the Top of high Mountains, for the Air is there ſo pure (as they call it) that is, wants ſo much of its Gravity and Elaſticity, that they breathe with very great Difficulty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All the Fluids in Animals have in them a Mixture of elaſtic <hi>Aura,</hi> which when ſet at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhews its Energy, and cauſes thoſe Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we obſerve in the Blood and Spirits: Now when the Preſſure of the Atmoſphere, upon the Surface of our Body is diminiſh'd, the inward Air in the Veſſels muſt neceſſarily be inabled to exert its Force, in Proportion to the leſſening the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Elaſticity of the outward; hereupon the Juices begin to ferment, change the Union and Cohaeſion of their Parts, break their Canals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is very plain in living Creatures put into the Receiver, exhauſted by the Air-Pump, which always ſwell as the Air is more and more drawn out; their Lungs at the ſame Time contracting themſelves, and falling ſo together as to be hardly diſcernible

            <p>E're we proceed to Matters of Fact, it may be worth the while to take Notice, that Effects depending on ſuch Cauſes as theſe, muſt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be moſt viſible in weak Bodies and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid Conſtitutions, when other Circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to their taking Place.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0682502100:13"/>but it was impoſſible that ſuch a Diſpoſition ſhould not in ſome Caſes be prejudicial to a few. The Poſition and Diſtance of the Sun are ſo adjuſted, as to give in the moſt beneficial Manner poſſible, Heat and Light to the Earth; yet this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſome Places may be too hot for ſome weakly Bodies; ſome Autumns too ſultry to agree with ſome Animals, and ſome Winters too cold to be endured by ſome tender Creatures: The whole however we muſt own, is moſt carefully provided for.

The Girl, who was of a luſty full Habit of Body, continued well for a few Days, but was at Full Moon again ſeized with a moſt violent Fit, after which, the Diſeaſe kept its Periods conſtant and regular with the Tides; She lay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Speechleſs during the whole Time of Flood, and recovered upon the Ebb. The Father who lives by the <hi>Thames</hi> Side, and does Buſineſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the River, obſerved theſe Returns to be ſo punctual, that not only coming Home, he knew how the Child was before he ſaw it, but in the Night has riſen to his Employ, being warned by Cries when coming out of her Fit, of the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Water. This continued 14 Days, that is, to the next great Change of the Moon, and then a dry Scab on the Crown of the Head, (the Effect of an Epiſpaſtick Plaiſter, with which I had covered the whole <hi>Occiput</hi> in the Beginning of the Illneſs) broke, and from the Sore, tho' there had been no ſenſible

            <p>Every one knows how great a Share the Moon has in forwarding thoſe Evacuations of the weaker Sex, which have their Name from the conſtant Regularity they keep in their Returns; and there is no Queſtion to be made, but the Correſpondency we here obſerve, would be greater ſtill, and even Univerſal, did not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0682502100:17"/>many Accidents, and the infinite Varieties in particular Conſtitutions one Way or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to make a Difference. It is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that in Countries neareſt to the <hi>Aequator,</hi> where we have proved the Lunar Action to be ſtrongeſt, theſe Monthly Secretions are in much greater Quantity than in thoſe near the Poles, where this Force is weakeſt.

            <p>The Caſe being thus with Females, it is no wonder if we ſometimes meet with Periodical Haemorrhages anſwering to the Times of the Moon in Males alſo. For as a greater Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Blood in Proportion to the Bulk in <hi>one</hi> Sex, is the Reaſon of its diſcharging it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thro' proper Ducts, at certain Intervals, when the Preſſure of the external Air being diminiſh'd, the internal <hi>Aura</hi> can exert its Elaſticity; ſo in the <hi>other,</hi> if at any Time there happens to be a Superabundancy of the ſame Fluid, together with a weak Tone of the Fibres; it is plain that the Veſſels will be moſt eaſily burſt, when the Reſiſtance of the Atmoſphere is leaſt. And this more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if any accidental Hurt, or rarefying Force has firſt given Occaſion to the other Cauſes to take Effect.</p>
            <p>I know a Gentleman of a tender Frame of Body, who having once, by over-reaching, ſtrained the Parts about the Breaſt; fell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon into a Spitting of Blood, which for a Year and half conſtantly return'd every New Moon, and decreaſing gradually, continued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

            <p>It is very well worth the Pains to enquire what Share ſuch an Alteration in the Weight and Preſſure of the Atmoſphere may have in the <hi>Criſes</hi> or Changes of acute Diſeaſes. The Antients made great Account of <hi>critical</hi> Days, and regulated their Practice according to the Expectation they had from them; This Part of Phyſick is grown now into Diſuſe, quite
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0682502100:22"/>ſlighted, and even ridiculed; and that I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe chiefly for theſe two Reaſons. In the firſt Place, becauſe the earlieſt Obſervations of this Kind, which were drawn into Rules, being made in <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries, when theſe came to be applied to the Diſtempers of the <hi>Northern</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, without Allowance given for the Difference of the Climate, they were oftentimes found not to anſwer. And ſecondly, Fevers of old were treated with few or no Medicines, the Motions of Nature were carefully watched, and no Violence offer'd to interrupt her Work. The Hiſtories therefore of <hi>Criſes,</hi> though of great Uſe, and Certainty under ſuch Management as this, were at length unavoidably ſet aſide and loſt; when acute Caſes came to be cured, according to this or that Hypotheſis, not only by Evacuations, but hot or cold Alteratives too; there being no longer any Room for thoſe Laws of Practice, which ſuppoſed a regular and uniform Progreſs of the Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, in order to underſtand a little both what might induce the firſt Maſters of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to ſo nice and ſtrict an Obſervance in this Point; and what Grounds there may be now, for a more due Regard to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, even upon the Score of the Lunar At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction only, I propoſe the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All Epidemick Diſeaſes, do in their regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Courſe require a ſtated Time, in which they come to their Height, decline, and leave the Body free.</p>
            <p>This is ſo conſtant and certain, that when a Fever of any <hi>Conſtitution</hi> which is <hi>continual</hi> in one Subject, happens from ſome other Cauſe,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0682502100:23"/>in another to be <hi>intermitting,</hi> the Paroxiſms do always return ſo often as all together to make up juſt as many Days of Illneſs as he ſuffers, whoſe Diſtemper goes on from Beginning to End, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Abatement.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Sydenham,</hi> a ſworn Enemy to all Theories, learn'd thus much from downright Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and gives this Reaſon why autumnal Quartans holds ſix Months, becauſe by Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the Fits of ſo long a Time amount to 336 Hours, or 14 Days, the Period of a continual Fever of the ſame Seaſon.

            <p>So <hi>Galen</hi> takes Notice, that when an exquiſite Tertain is terminated in ſeven Paroxiſms, a true Continual, at the ſame Time, has its Criſis in ſeven Days; that is, the Fever laſts as long in one as in the other, in as much (ſays he) as <hi>a Fit in an Intermitting Fever, anſwers to a Day in a Continual.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. In theſe Caſes there is always a Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Blood, which goes not off till the active Particles are thrown out by thoſe Organs of Secretion, which, according to the Laws of Motion, are moſt fitted to ſeparate 'em. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. As different Liquors put upon a Ferment, are depurated in different Times, ſo the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Fluid takes up a determined Period, of which it is diſcharged of an induced Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Symptoms, during this Ebullition, do not proceed all along in the ſame Tenour; but on ſome Days particularly, they give ſuch
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0682502100:24"/>evident Marks of their good or bad Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that the Nature of the enſuing <hi>Solution</hi> may very well be gueſs'd at, and foretold by 'em.</p>
            <p>Things being thus, Thoſe Days on which the Diſeaſe was ſo evidently terminated one Way or other, might very juſtly be call'd the Days of <hi>Criſis;</hi> and thoſe upon which the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Illneſs was diſcovered by moſt viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tokens, the <hi>Indices</hi> of the <hi>critical Days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus far the Foundation was good: but when a falſe Theory happen'd unluckily to be joined to true Obſervations, this did a little puzzle the Cauſe. <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> it is plain, knew not to what to aſcribe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Regularity with which he ſaw the Periods of Fevers were ended on the <hi>Seventh, Fourteenth, One and Twentieth</hi> Day, <hi>&amp;c.

               </note>, upon which this Inconvenience fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, that when a Criſis fell out a Day ſooner or later than this Computation required, his Meaſures were quite broken; and that this
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0682502100:25"/>muſt neceſſarily oftentimes happen, will appear by and by.</p>
            <p>Upon this Score <hi>Aſclepiades</hi> rejected this whole Doctrine as vain,
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> being aware of this, ſucceeded much better in his reaſoning upon the Matter, and very happily imputed the critical Changes not to the Power of Numbers, but to the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Moon; which he obſerves, <hi>has a mighty Action upon our Earth, exceeding the other Planets, not in Energy, but in Nearneſs</hi>
               <note n="(c)" place="bottom">

               <note n="(d)" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Reſult of the whole Affair, in ſhort is this: A <hi>Criſis</hi> is no more than the Expulſion of the morbific Matter out of the Body, thro' ſome or other of the Secretory Organs; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which, it is neceſſary that this ſhould be prepar'd and comminuted to ſuch a Degree, as is required to make it paſs into the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the reſpective Glands; and therefore <hi>as</hi> the moſt <hi>perfect Criſis</hi> is by <hi>Sweat,</hi> (both by Reaſon that the Subcutaneous Glands do naturally diſcharge more than all the other put together, and alſo that their Ducts being the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0682502100:26"/>ſmalleſt of any, whatſoever comes this Way is certainly very well divided and broken) <hi>ſo</hi> the moſt <hi>imperfect</hi> is an <hi>Haemorrhage;</hi> becauſe This is an Argument that what offends is not fit to be caſt off in any Part, and conſequently breaks the Veſſels by the Efferveſcence of the Blood. An <hi>Abſceſs</hi> in thoſe Organs which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate thick ſlimy Juices, is of a middle Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture betwixt theſe two.</p>
            <p>Now it is very plain, That if the Time, in which either the Peccant Humour is prepar'd for Secretion, or the Fermentation of the Blood is come to its Height, falls in with thoſe Changes in the Atmoſphere which diminiſh its Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; the <hi>Criſis</hi> will then be more compleat and large. And alſo, that this Work may be forwarded or delay'd a Day upon the Account of ſuch an Alteration in the Air; the Diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Veſſels upon which it depends, being hereby made more eaſy, and a weak Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Body in ſome Caſes ſtanding in need of this outward Aſſiſtance. Thus a Fever which requires about a Week to its Period, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> obſerved, have a good Criſis on the ſixth, and ſometimes not 'till the eighth Day.</p>
            <p>In Order therefore to make true Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Kind, the Time of Invaſion is to be conſidered, The genuine Courſe of the Diſtemper muſt firſt be watched, which is not to be interrupted by any violent Methods: The Strength of Nature in the Patient is to be conſidered, and by what Secretions the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis is moſt likely to be performed; and it will then be found, that not only the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Full</hi> Moons, but even the <hi>Southings,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0682502100:27"/>viſible or latent, of the Planet, are here of conſiderable Moment.</p>
            <p>For Confirmation of which, we need only to reflect on what Mr. <hi>Paſchal</hi> has remark'd, <hi>concerning the Motions of Diſeaſes and Births and Deaths</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Philoſ. Tranſact.</hi> No. 202.</note>. Dividing the <gap reason="foreign">

In like manner, that in Agues, the Tumult of the Fits gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally laſts all the Tiding-Time, and then goes off in kindly Sweats in the Ebbs.

            </head>
            <p>IT having been explained in the Beginning of this Diſcourſe, how thoſe Influences of the Heavens, which favour the <hi>Returns of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,</hi> may likewiſe raiſe <hi>Winds</hi> at the ſame Times; and that we feel the different Effects of <hi>Theſe</hi> according as other Cauſes do concur to the Motion of the Air; it will not be amiſs to ſhew, in one Inſtance or two, how much Natural Hiſtory confirms this Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>There happened on the 26th of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1703, a little before Midnight, a moſt terrible <hi>Storm</hi> of <hi>Wind,</hi> the Fury of it is ſtill freſh in every one's Mind, which laſted above ſix Hours.</p>
            <p>It is not to the preſent Purpoſe to relate its Hiſtory and Cauſes; What we obſerve is, That the Moon was at that Time <hi>in Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaeo,</hi> and juſt upon the Change to <hi>New.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both which Accounts its Action in raiſing the Atmoſphere muſt be great; And hence indeed the <hi>Tides</hi> which followed were alſo very great, and the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the <hi>Barometer,</hi> at leaſt, in moſt Places, fell very low.</p>
            <p>This Influence was, without all doubt, aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome ſuch other Cauſes of <hi>Winds,</hi> as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0682502100:29"/>we have mentioned; theſe we can't know, but may however take Notice how much the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt State of the Air contributed to this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity.</p>
            <p>After a greater Quantity of Rains than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary had fallen in the Summer and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, in thoſe Places where the Storm was felt, the Winter came on much warmer than uſual; ſo that the Liquor in a Thermometer, of which the 84th Degree notes Froſt, never fell below the 100th
<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Philoſ. Tranſact. No. 289.</note>.</p>
            <p>Hence we may very well believe, that the Atmoſphere was at that Time fill'd with Atoms of <hi>Salts</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> out of the Vapours rais'd by the Heat from the moiſt Earth, which being variouſly combined and agitated, gave that deadly Force to the Motion of the Air.</p>
            <p>A Proof of this we have not only from the frequent <hi>Flaſhes</hi> of <hi>Lightning,</hi> obſerved a little before the Storm, but alſo from what the Country People took Notice of the next Day, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Graſs and Twiggs of the Trees, in Fields remote from the Sea, taſted very ſalt, ſo that the Cattle wou'd not feed on them.</p>
            <p>Our Hiſtories mention another Storm, which if not equal to this laſt in Violence, is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thought the greateſt that had then ever been known and memorable from the Time at which it happened, <hi>viz.</hi> on the 3d of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> 1658, the Day on which the Uſurper <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> died.</p>
            <p>No <hi>Ephemerides</hi> that I know of relate the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0682502100:30"/>Condition of the Air that Year, but it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to remark, That whatever other Cauſes concurr'd, their Force was accompanied with a <hi>Full Moon,</hi> juſt before the Time of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal Equinox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the ſame Score it comes to paſs, That in thoſe Countries which are ſubject to frequent <hi>Inundations,</hi> theſe Calamities are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to happen at the Time of the <hi>Moon</hi>'s greateſt Influence, ſo that the learned <hi>Baccius</hi>

For although we muſt allow all the Parts of the Machine of this World to be framed and moved by eſtabliſhed Laws, and that the ſame Diſpoſition of its Fabrick, which is moſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to the whole, muſt of Neceſſity, in ſome few Places now and then occaſion Hurts and Miſchiefs; it is however moſt highly reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that we ſhould yield to the Supreme
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0682502100:31"/>Creator an abſolute Power over all his Works; Concluding withal, that it was perhaps agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Divine Wiſdom, to order the Make of the World after ſuch a Manner, as might ſometimes bring Miſchiefs and Calamities upon Mankind, whom it was neceſſary by the Frights of <hi>Storms, Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning</hi> to keep in a continual Senſe of their Duty.</p>
