            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>IN moſt of the Arts and Sciences, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors have formed general outlines of the plan, method, and arrangement, to be followed by the pupils who ſtudy them.</p>
            <p>Some ſort of analyſis might be of equal ſervice to young proficients in parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary eloquence—A multitude of words, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered with rapidity and vehemence, puzzle and confuſe thoſe who are unacquainted with the technical trick of debate—It will be of uſe therefore to prepare for our juvenile ſenators, a compendious outline
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0698501300:5"/>of ſuch arguments as may moſt probably be employed at the opening of the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Seſſion.</p>
            <p>And, in order to detect the fallacy of much popular rhetoric, brief obſervations will be annexed to each of the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place</hi> topics; by which means, when any of the old Oppoſition Orators begin to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh away on theſe <hi>trite</hi> arguments, the young members may, by recurring to the proper ſection in the Analyſis, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find moſt of the <hi>thoughts,</hi> and many of the <hi>words,</hi> that will be uſed, <hi>for,</hi> or <hi>againſt</hi> the Queſtion; with this main difference, that each will be much ſhorter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably both more intelligible.</p>
            <p>The Author is aware, that nothing can be ſimpler than this plan; it being much
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0698501300:6"/>of the ſame nature with an <hi>Exhibition Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue,</hi> which merely deſcribes the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the ſeveral compoſitions preſented to public criticiſm; and poſſibly ſome read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may think it might have been well, to complete the ſimile, by ſubjoining in this inſtance, as well as in the former, the names of the ſeveral Artiſts; but, though ſomething of that dramatic kind, was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſucceſsfully attempted in a pamphlet, called <hi>Anticipation,</hi> it ſeems more adviſe-able to avoid the leaſt appearance of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, on the preſent occaſion:—The ridicule that was then, with ſome proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, directed againſt the tediouſneſs, or the pedantry, or the droll dotage, that charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terized ſome individual ſpeakers; would now be wholly unneceſſary: it never was
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0698501300:7"/>a taſk of difficulty to expoſe the folly of mock eloquence; once atchieved, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition would be as diſguſtful as the ſubject.</p>
            <p>But ſophiſtry aſſumes new ſhapes, and acts under various diſguiſes; like the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious enchanter in romance, to be finally overcome, it muſt be attacked in all its transformations; yet he who engages in this war of words, can be but little expoſed to any charge of preſumption; it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat far more tireſome, than perilous; and however ſeverely his patience may be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, he will have but few occaſions to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert his ſtrength; ſo that as his utmoſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph can be only proportionable to ſo inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or a conteſt, he may be ſecure at leaſt from the imputation of vanity in undertaking it.</p>

            <div type="argument">
               <head>THE LATE AND THE NEW PARLIAMENT.</head>
               <p>THE late parliament was the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous, ſlaviſh, baſe, ſordid, venal, mean, inconſiſtant, deſpicable parliament, that ever exiſted.—It betrayed the rights of the people, trampled on their privileges; violated their majeſty; ſervilely crouched to prerogative; and waſted the blood and treaſure of the public, to ſatiate private ambition and avarice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0698501300:11"/>Hence national reſentment was univerſally rouzed; the elective body, to a man, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the repreſentative, and all ranks and orders of people anxiouſly expected the happy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diſſolution. At the approach indeed of that awful criſis, political frailty felt a ſort of death-bed penitence; it was the hectic virtue of a moment: the panic however ſoon ſubſided; and, fluſhed with new hopes of a protracted exiſtence: the old ſeptennial methodiſt roſe, like Voltaire from ſickneſs, impatient for deeper vices, and anxious for more aggravated profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy.</p>
               <p>"Such <hi>was</hi> your parliament—Look you now what follows"—A young phoenix riſing from the aſhes of the old!—the beſt of all poſſible parliaments!—a pure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt, delegation from the true ſource of all real power, the people: unfettered by connections; unclogged with errors; free to conſult; to deliberate; to determine; for the public ſafety! "Such <hi>is</hi> your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament."</p>
               <div type="answer">

                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>IT is difficult to give a juſt idea, of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated ſtile of oppoſition invectives; particularly on ſuch a theme as the preſent, where the free indulgence of them, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checked by any of thoſe awkward reſtraints, which ſome young men have of late, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutionally thrown on them.—A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed parliament is one of thoſe <hi>immaterial</hi> objects, that every one may attack with perfect impunity; and indeed, under the preſent reſtrictions, it is no ſmall conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the component parts of ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate body, to have in the very nature of their conſtitution, a ſafe reſource for the exerciſe of their wildeſt rancour, and moſt fanciful aſperity. It is however uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly whimſical, that almoſt the very ſame ſet of men, who actually compoſed the ſubject of this invective, ſhould be themſelves the auditors of it; and at the ſame moment that they are ſtigmatized in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0698501300:13"/>their late capacity, they ſhould receive ſo premature a panegyric in their new one; yet ſuch is almoſt preciſely the caſe.</p>
                  <p>The laſt parliament and the preſent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament being very nearly one, and the ſame.—It is true indeed, there have been ſome exchanges, and different branches of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular families have taken their rotation in election honours; but <hi>ſtill</hi> both parliaments are <hi>eſſentially</hi> and <hi>effectually</hi> alike: ſo that, with a few inconſiderable exceptions, the returns and re-elections incontrovertibly prove, that all the imputations of national odium and contempt, ſo induſtriouſly thrown on the laſt parliament, muſt at leaſt have been groſsly exaggerated, if not entirely falſe.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>penitential vote,</hi> ſo often, and ſo vauntingly relied on, it will always be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that the Houſe <hi>at large,</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>report</hi> the <hi>abſtract propoſition</hi> ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully paſſed, by a committee of inferior
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0698501300:14"/>numbers—It was indeed a florid weakneſs; the hectic effort of exhauſted ſedition; that "Like the faint offer of a latter ſpring, ſerved but to uſher in the fall, and withered in an affected bloom."</p>

               <head>COMPLIMENTARY INVITATIONS TO BE SCATTERED AMONG THE YOUNG MEMBERS.</head>
               <p>AS it is ſcarcely poſſible that any gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of ſpirit, or independence, can ſupport the miniſtry, without forfeiting all pretenſions to virtue, juſtice, honor, and common ſenſe, there can be ſtill leſs doubt, that thoſe, who are leaſt hackneyed in the ways of public life, and conſequently moſt accutely ſenſible of the allurements of popularity, will inſtantly join the preſent conſtitutional, upright, conſiſtent, generous, juſt, oppoſition.</p>
               <p>What can be ſo flattering to youthful am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, as being immediately enrolled in a band of genuine patriots, and regiſtered among the only Britiſh worthies of the age! what ampler field can the world afford for the diſplay of genius, learning and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, than that glorious conteſt of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> with <hi>England,</hi> of freedom againſt tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0698501300:16"/>In the moſt proſperous times, the <hi>ſupport</hi> of miniſters is an inglorious and vulgar taſk, compared to the <hi>control</hi> of them. There is little, or no ſcope for rhetoric, in plain ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, regular calculations, legal preciſion, and ſuch other trite and plain modes, as men in office <hi>muſt</hi> neceſſarily purſue. On the contrary, <hi>oppoſition,</hi> has inexhauſtible themes of eloquence—ſuſpicions, alarms, menaces, and predictions, (not to mention impeachments, which cannot well recur ſo regularly) are rich and conſtant ſources of popular declamation. Beſides, one of the chief benefits that ariſe from new parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is the acceſſion of freſh ſupplies of genius and cultivated abilities. And perhaps, there never was a time, when ſuch immenſe quantities of both were introduced into the Houſe of Commons as upon the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion—young gentlemen, not only endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with prodigious abilities, but who have been for many years back, in <hi>training</hi> for debate, abound on all ſides.—What an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite pity would it be then, were ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved talents obſcured and ſhrowded from public admiration, in the dull details of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0698501300:17"/>politicians!—In the moment of peril and diſmay, it is happy for this nation at large to have ſelected men, formed, as it were, for the ſalvation of their country.—It is no leſs fortunate for thoſe, who poſſeſs ſuch talents, to have them called into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at ſo aweful a criſis.—Indeed, it is one of the great benefits ariſing from the preſent calamities, that gentlemen have now much finer opportunities and more numerous ſubjects, for diſplaying their talents, than they could poſſibly have enjoyed in more quiet times; and which too, if not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately taken advantage of, may irretrievably eſcape by ſome unlucky change, to proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity abroad, or humanity at home.</p>

                  <p>WHAT antidote can reaſon provide againſt ſuch potent incantations?—The cold ſuggeſtion of more temperate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice would feebly reſiſt the Syren voice of popular allurement; and vainly is judgment addreſſed, where the ſubtle appeal is more fancifully made to vanity and inexperience. To examine and analize the ſeveral properties of real <hi>debate,</hi> in diſtinction to thoſe of wild <hi>declamation,</hi> would appear too refined: to ridicule the prevailing paſſion for oratory, too trite: ſtill leſs would it be proper, under this diviſion, either to enquire into the merits of Minority, or to diſcuſs the juſtice and ſincerity of their claims to public confidence.</p>
                  <p>To raiſe <hi>new levies</hi> for the ſervice of Oppoſition, is ſo entirely the <hi>intereſt</hi> of that ſet of men who command the <hi>old troops,</hi> that it cannot fail to create ſome flight doubts of the perfect ſincerity and pure zeal of their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0698501300:19"/>complimentary invitations. But (without conſidering ſuch an adventurous junction in the more ſerious light of a deſertion from every ſolid and ſubſtantial intereſt of our country) it may not be wholly unuſeful to ſuggeſt how impoſſible it is for the Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in its preſent ſtate, to afford thoſe nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and happy occaſions for the diſplay of genius and eloquence, which its advocates ſo ſpeciouſly hold out as the ſtrongeſt incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to youthful ambition.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minority</hi> has long been directed, and controuled, by a few leading orators; who, after years of fatiguing ſervice, are moſt juſtly entitled to rank as veterans in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and are now too reaſonably jealous of their eſtabliſhed precedence, to participate in fame with the raw recruits they are ſo anxious to enliſt—One of their leaders has expreſsly publiſhed <hi>the Articles of Party;</hi> with much fairneſs and candour, avowing the neceſſity of obedience to a common leader, and of acting in due ſubordination to his commands. With more zeal, indeed,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0698501300:20"/>than policy, this champion of party very frankly decried and ridiculed all ſeparate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions and individual efforts, as attempts of equal inefficacy and preſumption; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raſhly diſcovered ſo much more of this degrading ſyſtem than former politicians had thought it wiſe, or decent to reveal, that many men of proper pride and ſpirit were diſguſted with the <hi>Rockingham ſervice,</hi> and beg'd leave to <hi>reſign their commiſſions</hi> — Others of ſubtler talents, laboured with more art and caſuiſtry to explain away theſe dangerous <hi>articles:</hi> but ſtill, however ſpeciouſly they argued, they always had the precaution to maintain their rank in eloquence, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of every new competitor, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the <hi>credit,</hi> by monopolizing the <hi>time,</hi> of debate.</p>
                  <p>—No young man of talents has, for years back, met with the patronage of Oppoſition; every ſucceeding ſeſſion was the echo of the former; the ſame quantity of time has been annually devoted to the ſame tediouſneſs and protraction of debate; even ſtated hours ſeemed almoſt appointed for each particular
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0698501300:21"/>orator; nor was it ever a very difficult cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation to imagine who was actually ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at any given time, by only looking what o'clock it was; for the daily movements of their rhetoric were as mechanically exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, by a periodical ſucceſſion of figures, as thoſe of the famous <hi>Straſburg clock;</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept indeed, when ſome rough unmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able country-gentlemen <hi>would</hi> ſtart out, like the ſavages of St. Dunſtan's, to give a haſty ſtroke, or two, and then retire again, to reſt in peace on their unpoliſhed clubs.</p>
                  <p>But above all, the particular ſtile of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which characterize the preſent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager of Oppoſition, renders all inferior ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions in eloquence, almoſt uſeleſs and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous—There is a magnitude in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary talents, that contraſts, and caricatures the comparative inequality of thoſe who are placed in competition with them. Qualities, which, carried to an extreme, are ſtriking from their enormity, (ſuch as deſperate ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence and outrageous acrimony) become ridiculous in imitation, and impotent by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority. They reſemble theatrical thunder

The minor malcontents, and mimic republicans of the preſent day, would do well therefore to reflect, how very contemptible the petty partizans of faction have been, in all ages and countries. There were dozens of duodecimo Catilines, who buzzed conſpiracy in every corner of the Forum, though hiſtory has ſcarcely ſtooped to name them; Ravaillac had his <hi>monk committees</hi> and <hi>holy aſſociations,</hi> whoſe <hi>debates</hi> and <hi>reſolutions</hi> have been charitably conſigned to oblivion: nor has there ever been any deſperate leader, from the rank of <hi>Catiline</hi> to <hi>Cade,</hi> who has not boaſted a gang of followers, <hi>officious,</hi> and <hi>obſcure; buſy,</hi> and <hi>forgot.</hi>

               <p>IN the moment of moſt general danger to the very exiſtence of a ſtate, from a rebellion, and a foreign war, it becomes all wiſe, good, and prudent men, to devote their whole time to the concerting meaſures, not to overcome the common enemy, but to new model and patch up the conſtitution; juſt as, in a cloſely beſieged town, every clever fellow ſhould leave it to his inferiors to repell the aſſailants from the walls, and buſy himſelf, and his neighbours, in drawing plans to repair, and beautify the old town-hall, the aſſembly-rooms, and other build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the city. And this, not from any paradoxical confuſion, or ideal refinement, that the <hi>inſide</hi> of the town is to all intents and purpoſes the <hi>outſide;</hi> or that the ſaid edifices are <hi>virtually</hi> the fortifications; but for a much ſimpler and more ſubſtantial reaſon; namely that the day of diſtreſs and danger is the true time to frighten the magiſtrates into receiving their terms: which, if the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0698501300:30"/>ſiege is raiſed, will ſet them up for ever in fame and fortune; and if it be not, will ſerve at leaſt to recommend them to the victorious enemy as very ſhrewd and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble projectors.</p>
               <p>Now, in a ſtate like ours, it is clear that the conſtitution of parliament muſt always form the grand ſubject of political theory. Hence various ſchemes have been propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to purify, and refine it from all corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and many tedious preparations, in the nature of chymical proceſſes, have been occaſionally invented, to exalt it to what it really ſhould be, a kind of compound elixir of popular ſpirit.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of theſe experiments, ſome profeſſors inſiſted, that its whole efficacy muſt depend on the ingredients, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, being brought from their ſeveral native ſoils, free of all charges.—Others held, that larger quantities of its moſt wholeſome <hi>ſimples,</hi> ſhould be gathered out of the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and beſt cultivated lands, and not pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, like muſhrooms, from old waſtes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0698501300:31"/>and barren commons. But, however com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſifted, and refined, ſeveral concurred in opinion, that it <hi>never</hi> could keep its ſpirit above <hi>three</hi> years, becauſe formerly they only made it up for that time.</p>
               <p>But the laſt, and far moſt important diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of all, is, that it never poſſibly can be fit for uſe, or good for any thing at all, above a <hi>twelvemonth</hi> after it is firſt put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.—Or (to releaſe the metaphor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's quite exhauſted) that annual parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the grand arcanum, and ſovereign panacea, for all the diſtempers of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed and periſhing conſtitution. And, in order to eſtabliſh this important point; firſt, they affirm, that the virtue of that reſtricted duration beyond a triennial one, is very clearly proved by a converſe ratio of the old homely adage, <hi>"There can never be too much of a good thing,"</hi> which, being inverted, very fairly carries the queſtion <hi>by three to one,</hi> againſt triennial in favour of annual parliaments—And next, the ingenious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates of this improvement, as clearly prove the undoubted <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>pleaſure,</hi> that would
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0698501300:32"/>naturally reſult both to conſtituents and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, from this annual revolution of intercourſe; by ſhewing how infallibly it muſt promote the health and ſpirits of the former, to be under a ſort of pleaſing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, to keep up a viſiting acquaintance, with their conſtituents in the purer air of the country; to whom, in <hi>their</hi> turn it would prove equally beneficial and delightful, by encouraging the briſkneſs of trade, and cheapneſs of proviſions, at ſuch conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions of election feſtivity, and convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial fellowſhip.—But theſe, and many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary motives, are loſt in the beauty, depth, and curioſity of the main argument, that is the foundation of this plan, which is briefly this; The myſterious excellence of the number TWELVE, that limits the months in this conſtitutional period: a cabaliſtical idea, which, tho' too ſubtle and complex to be dwelt on minutely in this place, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail to ſtrike every impartial mind with ſufficient force, on the mere mention of a few inſtances, among the millions which exiſt, wherein this number of TWELVE pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominates:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0698501300:33"/>with which ſhort enumeration the ſubject ſhall be cloſed.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, all the world knows, that the earth revolves in <hi>twelve</hi> months, round the <hi>twelve</hi> ſigns of the Zodiac; and this too, (as Monſieur Gebelin very critically expounds,) was typically illuſtrated, in Pagan mytholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, by the <hi>twelve</hi> labours of Hercules; all which, like our corporate and parochial of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, were performed exactly in the good, even, ſpace of a <hi>twelvemonth.</hi> Next, all petty juries are compoſed of <hi>twelve,</hi> and grand ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of twice <hi>twelve,</hi> good men and true; ſo too there are <hi>twelve</hi> judges; and, tho' the biſhops (excluſive of the two metropolitans) are juſt twice that number, yet there is a relative proportion even in this difference, which was certainly deſigned to ſignify the double glory of eccleſiaſtical, united with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral dignities; as well as the exact increaſe of piety in theſe latter, compared to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times; when, in truth, as every one knows, there were but <hi>twelve</hi> apoſtles.—Add to theſe therefore the <hi>twelve candleſticks</hi>

                  <p>THERE is but little neceſſity to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the fabulous alluſions, and ideal parallels, of declamation.

                  <p>It is neceſſary to treat the latter part of this argument with ſome degree of ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſolidity. Leaſt however too much time may appear to be waſted on it, it may be prudent to premiſe, that objections, founded on popular notions and prejudices, are eaſily conveyed in few words, and, so
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0698501300:41"/>conveyed, make ſtrong impreſſions; but whoever <hi>anſwers</hi> thoſe objections muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter all the notions to which they are allied, and to which they owe their ſtrength; and it is well if any words find admittance to remove the firſt impreſſion.</p>
                  <p>The appointment of party men to places of truſt, and power, was indeed a very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous policy: it muſt however be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that this <hi>policy</hi> was founded on a very liberal and generous hope, that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the forms of oppoſition might be kept up, and even the technical licentiouſneſs of debate perſevered in, yet that every man of honor, at ſo awful a period, would diveſt himſelf of all the little prejudices and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of party, and feel his mind actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the nobleſt impulſe, to ſuſpend at leaſt all private reſentment, if not to form a truly glorious coalition, founded on public principle, and national honor.—Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the accompliſhment of ſo noble a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, would have been crowned with far different ſucceſs, from that which has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually attended its attempt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0698501300:42"/>But, to avoid theſe painful, and vain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections; in proceeding to anſwer the charge of <hi>violent and unconſtitutional diſmiſſion,</hi> it muſt firſt be remembered that <hi>removals</hi> are not <hi>puniſhments.</hi>—It would be abſurd to imagine, that a meer private prejudice in political meaſures, however vague and fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or even pernicious in its tendency to the general welfare of the ſtate, can become an object of <hi>penalty:</hi> But it is indeed a very different queſtion, with what propriety thoſe perſons, who not only avow ſuch opinions with the fond attachment of innovation, but alſo diſſeminate them with moſt active zeal, ſhould be continued in thoſe very ſtations, which afford moſt frequent and moſt exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive opportunities, to ſpread them with all the weight of influence and authority.—And next, as to the <hi>right</hi> of diſmiſſion, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious that the ſame power, which <hi>appoints</hi> to offices, muſt neceſſarily <hi>remove</hi> from them: both are exerciſes of that plain diſcretionary truſt neceſſarily repoſed in all governments, to the end that every delegation of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority may be lodged in ſuch hands as ſhall ſeem beſt affected to thoſe who employ
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0698501300:43"/>them.—Nor is this <hi>preventive policy</hi> of guarding againſt diſſaffecton leſs congenial with the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of our conſtitution.—The prerogative of appointment to offices was originally unlimited; but, at the Reſtoration, the parliament moſt expreſsly declared the neceſſity of guarding with jealous vigilance againſt the introduction of thoſe perſons into places of <hi>power</hi> and <hi>truſt,</hi> whoſe opinions and prejudices rendered them dangerous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants for the ſtate to employ.</p>
                  <p>Hence the <hi>corporation</hi> and <hi>teſt acts;</hi> which (tho', at firſt, they may ſeem rather formed to guard the mitre, than the crown) were in fact, more really directed againſt the <hi>civil</hi> than the <hi>religious</hi> principles of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters.</p>
                  <p>Theſe diſabling ſtatutes very clearly prove two points, both of which are material to this queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that it is perfectly conſtitutional to exerciſe the prerogative of appointment to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0698501300:44"/>offices, with a ſtrict and cautious attention to the principles of thoſe who are to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in them: and next, that in every other inſtance, except in theſe ſtatutable diſquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, this prerogative is entirely unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and abſolutely diſcretionary; for it is plain, that the very reſtriction in thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted caſes, virtually eſtabliſhes its inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance in every other. But ſo anxious were the reſtoration parliament to remove all poſsibility of any future encroachment on the diſcretionary prerogative of militia ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, that an act was unanimouſly paſſed, expreſſive of the national abhorrence of that recent uſurpation of them, which had fatally given arms to innovation, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the conſtitution, under the ſpecious pretence of amending it.</p>
                  <p>By the ſame act alſo, it was directly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that thoſe very appointments had ever been, and for ever ſhould continue, the unali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enable and uncontrouled right of the crown.</p>
                  <p>Such then being both the <hi>letter</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the law on this point, it is but mere
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0698501300:45"/>matter of curioſity, to conſider the plain principles, on which this power is founded, both in <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>civil</hi> ſociety.</p>
                  <p>In the former, tho' all men were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally on an equality, yet the diſtinction of abilities ſet the firſt bounds.—It required wiſdom and courage for council and arms—and it was neceſſary of courſe to exclude from each, ſuch as were reſpectively defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in either.</p>
                  <p>So far forth therefore there was a <hi>natural</hi> limitation.—But in <hi>civil</hi> ſociety it is equally important, in all delegations of power, to connect affection to the government, with the other leading qualifications; for (as has been too often proved) a courageous man, who hates his employers, is at leaſt as unfit to be truſted, as a coward; and wiſdom, connected with enmity, would only ſerve to aggravate treachery in council.—The plain conſequence of which, is this; that either, no government has a right to preſerve itſelf againſt the diſaffection of a ſubject; or
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0698501300:46"/>elſe that every government has a right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from offfices of power and truſt, ſuch as render themſelves ſuſpected of diſaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <head>THE PRAISE OF PARTY.</head>
               <p>INdependance is a wild, unſocial idea—even a monk confeſſed, that, to abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely enjoy this mental ſolitude, man muſt change his nature to that of angels, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
               <p>In the progreſs of civilization, every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to perfection is founded, on relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing this ſolitary pride of thinking, or acting, for ourſelves alone—The rudeſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages have their clans, and chiefs; the freeſt republics their heads, and ſtatholders.</p>
               <p>From different degrees of ſtrength, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, or abilities, ſubordination ariſes.—To the boldeſt, or hardieſt, or wiſeſt, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme command in war, or in peace, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided—and the natural equality of each is prudently reſigned for the benefit of all—but chiefly on the ſpur of neceſſity, and the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0698501300:53"/>preſſure of complex operations, is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of dependance originally grounded, and ultimately eſtabliſhed—The former <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atea</hi> Roman dictatorſhip; by the latter, it was <hi>perpetuated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus then, as it appears, that all natural independance has been exchanged as the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for ſocial happineſs, ſo it is equally evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that, in the perfection of a civil ſtate, combinations and confederacies muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and perfected; and finally, that in the conflict of oppoſite contentions, the deciſive weight and efficient force of party muſt depend on its diſciplin'd ſubmiſſion to the controul of one common leader.</p>
               <p>Nor let it be objected that the avowed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilities of party, may, in the preſent times, provoke a cloſer union of <hi>miniſterialiſts,</hi> than might otherwiſe ſubſiſt among ſo divided a body—It is true, indeed, there is a gloomy cloud of diſcord and diſſention, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreads thoſe common foes of Oppoſition, and of their country—Auſpicious may it prove; and happy be the preſage of their

The former is indeed a phalanx of baſeneſs—the latter, the ſacred league of wiſdom and of honour.—If then the liſts of parliamentary fame muſt be martialed for the combat, who is there, can a moment heſitate, what arms to wield, whence the champion ſhould begin his bold career, or what is the enterprize his courage ſhould atchieve, to win the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal guerdon of renown?</p>

                  <p>THOUGH nothing is more certain than that public ſpirit is equally abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from credulous adherence, or coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indeciſion, yet to define the preciſe limits of either extreme would be to renew the <hi>commoneſt</hi> of all <hi>common-place</hi> theories.—It may be more uſeful to ſtate a few points admitted by the diſputants on both ſides.—It is allowed then, that fixed principles, and general maxims, ſhould be the eſtabliſhed guides of all bodies of men, whoſe office it is, to act together.</p>
                  <p>This conformity is reſtricted however to opinions; tho' it naturally inclines to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence in public conduct.—But leagues, and confederacies, founded on private attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only, lead to mean, and degrading ſubſervience; for more perſonal <hi>aſſociation</hi> is little better than conſpiracy-Hence, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a body of Engliſh gentlemen, (who are choſen by the nation to conſult, deliberate,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0698501300:57"/>and then determine) to herd at once, under any individual leader, and follow, wherever he calls, is equally abſurd, and inſolent.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be repeated however, that eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed principles and unequivocal maxims, are great, and proper guides.—To act conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with <hi>them,</hi> is ſenſe, and honour.—How contradictory to this ſyſtem are the language and the conduct of Oppoſition?—"I boaſt myſelf a party-man, and, therefore, will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the miniſter," are the very words per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually repeated in the Houſe of Commons by the greateſt advocates of minority.—Thus the badge and livery of faction are oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly diſplayed on <hi>one</hi> ſide of the houſe.—On the oppoſite, aſk one of the <hi>equivocal poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians,</hi> how he means to act, and he will anſwer you (and with perfect honor) that "he is no party-man, but will freely tell you, his general principles, and avow his former line of conduct."—And ſo far forth, he acts up to the ſpirit of the conſtitution.—But if afterwards his conduct is a deſertion of thoſe principles, and totally inconſiſtent with what he himſelf declares it to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0698501300:58"/>been; if, in ſhort, it is evaſive, ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, and mean; if he hangs aloof in the lobby; takes an impartial dinner in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining coffee-houſes; or happens unluckily to be called out, on very particular buſineſs, juſt before the diviſion; and then <hi>ſails</hi> up, and down, the paſſages; <hi>cruiſes</hi> in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee-rooms; <hi>bears away</hi> for the court of requeſts; or <hi>ſteers</hi> directly home in his coach, <hi>with his light out;</hi> then indeed, the previous acknowledgment of his former principles, and conduct, is equally uſeleſs, and ridiculous; and he muſt be content to rank in future, with thoſe home-hollanders or domeſtic dutchmen, whoſe cold ungrateful caution, and <hi>armed neutrality,</hi> is nearly as pernicious, and far more deſpicable, than the bolder hoſtilities of open enmity.</p>

                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>SUCH is the gloomy and exaggerated picture of our national diſtreſſes—Such are the pretences for cowardly deſpondency, for weak contemptible deſertion of all our intereſts and of all our hopes; and for a raſh and giddy ſubſervience to that fatal ſpirit of innovation, in the purſuit of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements we never may obtain, and to the riſque of calamities which we may never remedy—But it is not now the queſtion, whether a ſeaſon of external danger and hoſtility is the fitteſt for new arrangements of internal polity—When it was ſeen with what induſtry and activity the ſame ſet of men were buſied in running from one country to another, in private intrigue and public incitement, in dictat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where they had no property, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſing where they had no connexious; impartial men were led to ſuſpect, that the independent and reſpectable part of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0698501300:68"/>confederacy, far from being the real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers, were but the oſtenſible authors of the farce of reformation—To erect new aſſemblies, unknown to the conſtitution which they purpoſed to reform, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount to the legiſlature, which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to ſupplicate, was a ſyſtem as ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious in its motive, as alarming in its tendency—A Legiſlature inſulted and menaced, became the object of factious inſolence from every deſperate cabal—Even Oppoſition themſelves, who had firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled into the minds of men a contempt of order, felt, in their turn, the miſeries of lawleſs uproar, and lamented the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs they had produced—It ſhall not therefore be the preſent enquiry, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the worſt and moſt ruinous ſituation, that fancy can imagine, could juſtify a wild licentious anarchy at home—It is a far plainer and more limited enquiry; whether the preſent is in any degree that ruinous criſis, which, by extirpating every preſent hope, throws us at once on the unprincipled and profligate violence of theoretic enterprize, and ſpeculative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0698501300:69"/>or rather, whether we may not ſtill preſerve our expectations, ſtill ſuſtain our ſpirit, and confide both in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional reſources, and the courage of our people, to re-eſtabliſh our welfare, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain that reſpect and conſequence in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, which the generous ſpirit of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land has ever entitled her to maintain, as the protectreſs of liberty, and the arbitreſs of continental freedom—It is a glaring proof of the inconſiſtency of Oppoſition, that at the ſame moment, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated concerns of ſo extenſive a ſyſtem are exaggerated with every fanciful aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the impolicy of a defenſive war ſhould be grafted on the former propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—To have maintained an equality, at leaſt, againſt combined hoſtilities, does not appear to merit the imputation of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, ſo repeatedly thrown upon that department, to which the conduct of our navy is entruſted—It is ſtated as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential eſcape, that Count D'Eſtaign, by the epidemical ſickneſs of his armament, was prevented from entering the Britiſh Channel—But on the contrary, that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0698501300:70"/>calamity was indeed in its effects a national misfortune to Great Britain—For nothing but ſickneſs could have checked the raſh preſumption and impetuoſity of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, from hazarding an action, for which our fleet was perfectly prepared; and which too (as it was impoſſible to be foreſeen,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the accidental cauſe of thoſe very captures, which are injuriouſly ſtated as the effects of raſhneſs and ignorance in our Admiralty—It is clear, however, that convoys can only be protections againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of an inferior kind:—It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to provide a convoy for every inward, and outward-bound fleet, ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the combined fleets of France and Spain—nor indeed were grand fleets ever directed againſt mercantile fleets, except in thoſe caſes, where, as in the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, their greater operations, had been abſolutely prevented by ſickneſs, and other accidents, equally unforeſeen by both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties—Whether an implicit reliance muſt be paid to thoſe ill-omened predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which menace ruin and deſolation to our foreign poſſeſſions, from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0698501300:71"/>fleets abroad, muſt remain a doubt—It will always be remembered, that <hi>two years</hi> have already elapſed, ſince that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, when the ſame prophets of Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſo peremptorily foretold the abſolute impoſſibility of continuing the war for <hi>one</hi> year longer—With equal ſolemnity how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the loſs of Canada is predicted, from the terrors of a French proclamation, joined to the evidence of Monſieur de Ternay's poſſeſſion of Rhode Iſland—But, however myſterious the former may be, little ſtreſs can be laid on the latter: for the weakneſs of the Americans in the deſertion of an iſland to their inſidious protectors, is a very ſtrange proof of Engliſh cowardice in ſurrendering a whole continent which they have gained with glory, preſerved with humanity, and are reſolute to defend to the laſt extremity. It muſt be remembered, that Admiral Graves ſailed after the French ſquadron, and arrived at Rhode Iſland, much about the ſame time as Monſieur De Ternay had been admitted there. But ſince that arrival of the Engliſh fleet, the French
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0698501300:72"/>have remained totaly inactive. We have the ſuperiority, and they haven't dared to fight. Indeed the French aſſiſtance is far more calculated to ſupport the ſpirit of party there, than to form an expectation of co-operating, where they will always diſagree—But if, at length, the French ſhould determine to make North America the ſeat of war, we certainly may as well fight them there, as any where elſe—We can but loſe America at laſt—and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves gain nothing but blows and loſſes.</p>
                  <p>Yet, in contraſt to this pacific reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Monſieur De Ternay, is Lord Cornwallis's victory compared, by thoſe who conſider ſurrenders, glorious, and victories, ruinous.</p>
                  <p>Happy had it been for this country, if military wiſdom had been exerted, in this as in the laſt war, to juſtify and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talize valour, not to depreciate atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which indeed are the deciſive condemnation of thoſe who diſparage them.—If ſuch a principle is once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that defeat and ruin will be our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0698501300:73"/>real advantage, it would overturn every ſpirited exertion to obtain a favourable peace, by demonſtrating every new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition to be a motive for ſubmiſſion, every gallant and honourable enterprize a ground of tame acquieſcence to degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and diſgrace.—It would rob heroiſm of its beſt reward, and convert victory and triumph to a mere quibbling paradox of debaſement and infamy.</p>
                  <p>But with the ſame policy, the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of our continental ſituation are exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated and proclaimed. It is admitted to be too plain a truth, that far leſs hopes can be entertained from a rebellion in the Spaniſh colonies, than were confidently cheriſhed in England, upon the firſt idea of American reſiſtance—The Spaniſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſts want indeed the main force and deciſive ſtreſs of inſurgency and rebellion—They want a South American party in Spain, to countenance their diſaffection, to exalt their profligacy, to pronounce in a Senate the eulogiums of their leaders, to diſtract the National Councils in their
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0698501300:74"/>ſupport, to menace the legiſlature in their defence, to ſympathize with their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to triumph in their ſucceſs.—But as to Portugal, it is a ſubject of double grief, that, to eſtabliſh the perfidy of that ſtate, a military officer, once glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly engaged in its defence, ſhould now be the tame witneſs, not the gallant avenger of ingratitude and falſehood—In fact, the the learned Commodore was very much courted by the Portugueſe; nor will that people ever actually quarrel with thoſe, whom every commercial intereſt has fixed their beſt and ſureſt allies—The extreme of danger that political prediction can me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, is the loſs of Minorca; which however has always been retained, as a point of honour, rather than as a neceſſary poſſeſſion—When we are at peace, Gibralter is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the Mediterranean trade; and when at war, we have none at all—As to Holland, the Dutch have too great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in our funds, to aſſiſt in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſettlements abroad.—Nor is it poſſible, that the northern powers of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope can conſider it their intereſt to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0698501300:75"/>a nation, to which ſome of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt owe their exiſtence, others their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from the jealouſy of the houſe of Bourbon, and all have derived a generous, liberal, mediation and protection—Great Britain, that formerly eſtabliſhed Holland, can now reſiſt any ſimilar confederacy: and in this glorious ſtruggle, if ſhe does not ultimately ſecure a more firm independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſhe has already maintained at leaſt an equality of ſtrength, every where; and has vanquiſhed her enemies whenever they have ventured to contend with her—Her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in point of defence is better, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſtill more ſo, every hour—Both our army and navy are greater in number, and better in diſcipline and order, than ever they were—Wherever fleets and armies, have been ſent, ours have purſued them.—It has always been the rule to fend the new-raiſed regiments abroad, in time of war, becauſe the few we retain at home, ſhould lead and be an example to the militia, in caſe of invaſion. But to add new force to the national armaments, there is no boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0698501300:76"/>to the ſpirit, readineſs, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of individuals at home, to ſupport the dignity and the rights of this country—In one or two inſtances, ſuch ſingular zeal has called for uncommon honors; and, in thoſe extraordinary caſes alone, for a limited time, and for a ſpecific ſervice, thoſe gentlemen, who have hazarded their property, and lives, for the public ſafety, without any condition of rank or emolument for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſubſequent to ſuch ſervice, have been raiſed to <hi>temporary rank.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The complaint of our reſources has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly been repeated, when we have actually found them moſt efficient—Ten millions were raiſed laſt year almoſt in the courſe of a day. Nearly as much the year before: our revenues are improved; the ſinking-fund is certainly increaſing—War has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto produced no immediate diſtreſs to the ſtate; and creates a more general cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation than peace—The captures indeed are an exception—But let oppoſition ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain theſe effects of <hi>their</hi> jealous diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction againſt the profits of individual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0698501300:77"/>who formerly conducted the whole buſineſs, and periods of ſailing, for our mercantile fleets—But the navy-board hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undertaken it of late, and in the midſt of more complicated operations, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence has been, that too many of the convoys of tranſports, with ſtores, men, and proviſions, have failed—The former effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the buſineſs well, being well paid for it—The latter have done it ill, becauſe they are not paid at all.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch a ſituation, the ſenſe, the ſpirit of this country will ſtill perſevere, in a juſt and honourable cauſe—The happy appearance of returning loyalty in the ſouthern colonies, with the certainty of their reſources being cut off, joined to the gallantry of Lord Cornwallis's expedition up the Cheſapeak Bay, give the faireſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of connecting alſo the ſubmiſſion of the northern colonies—The former are moſt important to us, becauſe they are more productive, and the inhabitants more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclined to us.</p>

               <head>MISCELLANEOUS ELOQUENCE, OR, COLLATERAL RHETORIC FOR THE GALLERY.</head>
               <p>IN a mixed government like ours, public ſpeaking has a ſort of relative analogy to the compound ſtructure of our conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and to the different orders of which it is compoſed. Thus the higheſt, and moſt exalted rank poſſeſſes a proud pre-eminence of phraſeology, evidently characteriſtic of its ſovereignty, and excellence: while the ſecond degree, preſerves a kind of equipoiſe in ſtile; which, by a due mixture of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with plainneſs, denotes its intermediate balance, in the ſcale of legiſlative eloquence.—But chiefly, in the third eſtate, it is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly neceſſary, that the ſtream of rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric ſhould have certain particles of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, perpetually floating on its ſurface, as teſtimonies of the parent ſource, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, from which it ſprings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0698501300:80"/>Upon this ſyſtem, analogous principles might be formed, for the reſpective orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the ſeveral degrees—At preſent, however, a few documents only ſhall be ſuggeſted for the particular application of this principle, to the rhetoric of the Houſe of Commons; more eſpecially to that truly conſtitutional part of it, occaſionally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the ſtrangers in the gallery; whoſe "good report," as it is indeed "the brief and abſtract <hi>chronicle</hi>" of parliamentary fame, it becomes peculiarly prudent, as well as honourable, to obtain.</p>
               <p>In general then, as to the mode of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing this miſcellaneous eloquence with moſt eaſe and efficacy; it may be fairly laid down, that all eminent and projecting ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; all pointed, and epigrammatic quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; all metaphorical menaces; violent tropes; forced figures; and glaring orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; are well calculated to rouſe the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and hitch upon the memory, of <hi>the gallery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0698501300:81"/>Theſe, like the emphaſis of Italics in print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſummon the too negligent and careleſs mind, to pay a proper attention to many choice, and curious reſearches, intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the other matter; but which might otherwiſe periſh from their refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or irretrievably ſlip bye, unnoticed.</p>
               <p>But one of the more certain, and ſecure reſources of miſcellaneous rhetoric (and which I prefer mentioning, from its double illuſtration of precept and example,) is that conciliating reſpect, which ſome popular ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors more <hi>directly</hi> pay the <hi>gallery;</hi> in down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right acknowledgment of the <hi>"reſpectable appearance"</hi> of its company, on <hi>"important occaſions."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This condeſcending recognition (as it well deſerves indeed) generally meets with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per return; and it is pleaſing to obſerve, how wonderfully attentive the whole body of ſtrangers become, at the firſt mention of this general reſpectability —On ſome late occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, this idea has been carried ſomewhat too far: for there have not been wanting
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0698501300:82"/>certain popular orators, who politely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held their arguments, after each diviſion, and avowedly ſtopt all buſineſs, till the re-admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the audience.</p>
               <p>This however, tho' uncommonly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, is dangerous; as it may give a handle to ſome moody, malignant mutes, for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute excluſion of all interlopers on debate.—But it will always be good, to prepare, and ſcatter, as occaſion offers, ſome promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous panegyrics, of nearly the ſame, tho' not abſolutely ſo direct a tendency—for example—That <q>In a conſtitution, like ours, every thinking man, has a natural intereſt in public debate, which it is tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical to abridge, or violate.</q>—Or, that <q>It becomes all wiſe and cautious conſtituents to <hi>hear,</hi> in order to <hi>judge</hi> of their repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives!</q>—Or again, that <q>It is no ſmall conſolation, in the preſent aweful criſis, to find a general diffuſion of public vigilance and anxiety diſſeminated among all ranks, and orders of men; and more particularly in the preſent numerous and reſpectable <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance!</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0698501300:83"/>Theſe, and all others of the ſame kind, properly accompanied by ſubmiſſive tones, modulated breaks in the voice, and collateral attitudes of reſpectful inclination towards the gallery, ſcarcely ever fail of awakening the grateful attention, and ſometimes, dormant curioſity of the ſtrangers: eſpecially at ſuch times, as they have painfully, and patriotical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, perſevered, to combat both fatigue and appetite, in hourly expectation of collecting ſome ſcattered ſcraps of mutilated eloquence, for their own private, or domeſtic, conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>the Lycaeum,</hi> or <hi>Belle Aſſemblee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, in this ſpecies of miſcellaneous elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the effect is comparatively weak, and contemptible, conſidered with others that are founded upon the ſame principle.</p>
               <p>Thoſe already mentioned, can only be ſcattered occaſionally, in the exordiums, and ſome epiſodical parts, of an oration.—The latter, and more efficient claſs, muſt take their ſtation in the peroration, and declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory cloſe, of prolix ſpeeches; as a <hi>corps de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſerve,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0698501300:84"/>to ſupport and reinforce the main body of argument, after the harder ſervice of the day.—Theſe ought chiefly to conſiſt of ſome very new, and deep theory; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract, and metaphyſical; and calculated to give an idea of the originality, extent, and boldneſs of its author's mind; which, by connecting ſo many ingredients of ſublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, tends to inſpire a ſort of awe for ſuch pre-eminence of genius, and to create a confuſed notion that this inventive wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if it could but be applied to the more ſerious buſineſs of politics, would, with equal brilliancy, ſtrike out freſh ſyſtems of calculation, explore new reſources of finance, and produce unheard of wonders and revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, in all the complicated concerns of political enterprize.</p>
               <p>As this deſcription may ſerve to convey ſome idea of the laſt, and higheſt ſtile of miſcellaneous rhetoric; it will be ſufficient to elucidate the principle, by a ſingle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; on a ſubject too, not wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched in the laſt ſeſſion—UNIVERSAL

                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0698501300:88"/>But, it muſt be remembered, that much of the ſucceſs in both caſe, depends on a curious interſperſion of theſe brilliances, ſo as to relieve the heavier maſſes, and ſuſtain due proportions of light and ſhade—For rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical flowers muſt be diſpoſed and mingled with a ſtudious delicacy of arrangement, and interweave their blended beauties in juſt contraſt to the coarſer texture of more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial argument.</p>
                  <p>Thus (to adapt our expreſſions to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) in ſome parts of the rhetorical ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, ſmall ſeedlings of little <hi>violet</hi>-tropes ſhould ſeem to fearfully revoke even the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuter elegance, they ſo faintly diſcloſe—while, in others, more full-blown meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors, may diffuſe their <hi>roſeat</hi> luxuriance, and prodigally extend both ſtem and foliage among the thorny <hi>ſweet-briars</hi> of irony; or entwining knots of ſyllogiſtic <hi>woodbine</hi>—with theſe alſo there ſhould occaſionally be interſperſed, ſome brighter ornaments of wit, like the ſpangles of the pattern, to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riegate the <hi>ſilken</hi> ſentences of perſwaſion,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0698501300:89"/>and ſet them off with more dazzling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coration.</p>
                  <p>As to the latter, and far more original diviſion of miſcellaneous eloquence, though ſomething (it muſt be owned) of its baſer kind is equally obſervable in the <hi>fuſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tags</hi> and <hi>finales</hi> of our more ancient trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and on the ſame plan too of leaving a good impreſſion on the gallery; yet it is certainly, in its true nature and perfect ſtate, moſt completely ſublime: and in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified inſtance defective only, in its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountably narrow and reſtricted limitation to this world alone; when, with equal eaſe and efficacy, it might, and ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, not only to the inhabitants of our own moon, and other lunatic countries, but alſo to every nation and people in the whole planetary ſyſtem: ſo that, in any great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of aſtronomical worlds, <hi>univerſal whig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm</hi> ſhould as certainly be the ruling prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the delegates of Jupiter's ſatellites, as a whig-preſident muſt be deputed by the conſtituents of Saturn's ring—It is only neceſſary therefore to add, that the reſpect
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0698501300:90"/>for this kind of gigantic rhetoric will be greatly enhanced, by a proportionable elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and action, to juſtify and grace its mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence.—For here, though the figures are intentionally dilated and monſtrous, and the colouring ſyſtematically overcharged, like thoſe of <hi>cupola paintings,</hi> yet to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant auditor above, the rhetoric of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer will ſeem as natural and juſt; as the ſymmetry of the latter appears exact, and proportionable, to the ſtupid gazer below—For the eye and the ear are equally delighted and deceived, in both the one, and the other caſe.</p>
                  <p>In the delivery therefore of theſe <hi>rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal caricatures,</hi> all that can be requiſite to compleat their effect, is to accompany them by congenial degrees of violence and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, in expreſſion, and deportment; or, in ſhort, that the geſtures and elocution of the orator, who pronounces them, may ſomewhat reſemble thoſe of a furious <hi>feugle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> or a fanatic in a frenzy.</p>

               <p>AS moſt of the writers, who have treated of the Engliſh conſtitution, (particularly thoſe of foreign countries) very ingeniouſly prove, that a revolution is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary once a century to renovate its ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; ſo, in order to proportionably purify our interior government, the Miniſtry, by a fair and equable calculation, ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo a change <hi>once</hi> at leaſt, if not much oft'ner, in the courſe of every ten years.</p>
               <p>More or leſs degrees of this principle of <hi>mutability</hi> are incident to all bodies; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, or politic; and univerſally tend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their genuine force and purity.</p>
               <p>But if this theory had never before been applied to the adminiſtrations of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſurely the preſent miniſters, and the preſent times, would be admitted as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0698501300:92"/>arguments, in favour of that <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſupplication,</hi> which now univerſally prevails, for the diſmiſſion of a ruinous Miniſtry, and the ſubſtitution of a virtuous Oppoſition.</p>
               <p>This national demand is grounded on principles as plain, as they ought to be deciſive: namely, that the preſent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry are the ſole and original cauſes of that fatal ſource of all our miſeries, the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican war; and, on the contrary, that Oppoſition have from the firſt moment, unanimouſly reprobated the policy, and, with uniform conſiſtency, ever afterwards condemned the principle of colony-taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Such is the plain broad baſis of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſupplication to change the preſent ruinous, and execrated Miniſters—A ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, which every diſtrict of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try has not only united to enforce, but more diſtinctly promoted, with peculiar wiſdom, in the late honourable delegation of its beſt and greateſt ſupporters, the members of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0698501300:93"/>Weſtminſter and Surrey; unawed by the menaces, uncorrupted by the odious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of prerogative!</p>
               <p>To this national ſupplication for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the preſent flagitious Miniſters, the ſubſtitution of their virtuous Oppoſers, is, by neceſſary implication, inſeparably connected.—But, if the public virtues of that patriot band have not ſufficiently ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the juſtice of their claims on every Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh heart; let cooler, and more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate judgement trace their higher title to pre-eminence of ſtation, in unrivaled ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of genius, in unparallelled excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of education; let their habits, ſtudies, and private virtues, (all exerciſed, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſipated attention to advance the public good; all directed to the enrichment of their fellow-citizens; the diminution of national expence; and the promotion of juſtice, probity, and honour,) be at once the plaineſt, and ſureſt proofs of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted views, as well as the beſt pledges of their future upright, and honeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>

                  <p>TO this great, and moſt important of all queſtions; this cauſe, and end of all logic, argument, and eloquence; this attractive power, to whoſe magnetic force, all the lighteſt, or weightieſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of reaſoning muſt irreſiſtably gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate; with mixed ſenſations of regret, and ſatisfaction, we are at length ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.—Here ſhould every ſpecious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, and every eſtabliſhed proof, be equally admitted both from the advocates who attack, and the witneſſes who defend, the cauſe of adminiſtration—Here ſhould each ſlighteſt particle of evidence, each mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute and ſhadowy diſtinction of opinion, be fairly and impartially depoſited in that golden balance, which even-handed juſtice ſhould ſuſpend and poiſe, to weigh the doubtful conflict of political warfare—But, to aſſiſt at ſuch a trial would be far too ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, too laborious, for profaner pens—
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0698501300:95"/>It is a taſk that may be conſigned, with far greater ſecurity, to the buſy zeal, and perſevering patience, of polemical politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians—A haſty and imperfect anſwer to the foregoing argument, ſhall conclude <hi>theſe</hi> ſlighter toils—It muſt be owned then, that the philoſophy of miniſterial changes, is worthy the ſolidity of its fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign theoriſts—It ſeems indeed very cloſely borrowed from the Pariſian viciſſitudes of faſhion, dreſs, and even furniture, for the reſpective ſeaſons—On ſo accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating a ſyſtem, many fanciful varieties might be practiſed, to variegate ſucceſſive adminiſtrations; which, with that view, might be <hi>quarterly;</hi> and compoſed of more <hi>decided</hi> characters for the two greater divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the year, and a kind of <hi>demi-ſaiſon</hi> ſtateſmen for the leſſer.</p>
                  <p>This would give an impartial rotation to all ſorts of parties, and, by a juſt adaption of diſpoſitions, and tempers, analogous to their ſucceſſive periods, might produce the happieſt, and moſt extraordinary effects—For, young adventuring politicians might
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0698501300:96"/>ſow the principles of a ſcheme in the ſpring adminiſtration, which, when cultivated, and matured, by coalitions of the ſummer and autumnal miniſtries, would finally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the richeſt fruits, to be treaſured, and diſpenſed, by the colder caution and <hi>wintry</hi> wiſdom of more experienced counſellors. But after all, changes of miniſtry are neither as ſudden, nor as eaſy, as changes of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or changes of ſcenery at a play houſe.—And as the principle of <hi>mutability</hi> was not much inſiſted on, it will be fairer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the more ſerious and material ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the argument.—The petitions—and the two other great points—the <hi>origin</hi> of our troubles—and the conſiſtency of oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>To theſe it may be briefly anſwered, that if it can poſſibly be prov'd, that <hi>one</hi> of the petitions was not invented, framed, and circulated, by thoſe gentlemen, whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and elevation they ſeverally dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, the truth of them <hi>all,</hi> ſhall be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally admitted.—But, on the contrary, if the whole pile of them was raiſed, fabrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0698501300:97"/>and ſupported, by one, and, the ſame ſet of men, for one, and the ſame purpoſe; the force of their evidence will not be much relied on.—Next, as to the <hi>origin</hi> of the war, it is ſufficient to repeat that trite truth, "<hi>The</hi> STAMP ACT was, not the work of the preſent miniſtry!" And, in reſpect to the uniform reſiſtance to the principle of American ſubordination, the equally ſelf-evident propoſition muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be remembered "That to oppoſition alone are we indebted, for that abſolute and univerſal claim to it; THE DECLARATORY LAW."—Two moſt trite refutations, of the two triteſt of all charges! which however as indiſputably diſprove the imputed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency on the one ſide, as they abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely overthrow the ridiculous claim to conſiſtency on the other.</p>
                  <p>But, with regard indeed to the great crite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion of national opinion, <hi>the two popular elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> certainly much ſtreſs is wiſely and juſtly laid upon <hi>that</hi> point—nor would it prove an unpleaſing taſk for ſome advocate of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to draw an exact parallel, in the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0698501300:98"/>manner of Plutarch, between the <hi>four</hi> trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant candidates; wherein it would as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, that the <hi>two</hi> admirals, who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally ſhare theſe domeſtic honours, are not more preciſely alike in principles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; than the two ſtateſmen alſo of the ſame elections, reſemble each other, in high birth, exalted genius, cultivated taſte, ſound reaſoning, ſtrict honour, and <hi>undamped</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.—Which cloſe, and mathematical, conſideration of the ſeveral relative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of merit, thus mutually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, in their reſpective parallels, muſt, not only demonſtrate the exact correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their reciprocal excellencies, and therefore, by fair conſequence, the truth, and juſtice of declaring theſe two elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a common, and equal ſtandard of national opinion, but alſo at once overthrow every cavilling notion that may ariſe of their rediculous diſſimilitude, and eſtabliſh them, for the whole ſucceeding ſeſſion of parliament, as the great political parallel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logram of public ſpirit.</p>

                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0698501300:99"/>It may however be unneceſſary to continue much longer the myſterious inſinuation of INFLUENCE, ſo induſtriouſly circulated, preparatory to theſe boaſted triumphs—at the moment, it might have been judicious, nay, poſſibly, neceſſary, to lean on this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular argument—But to continue it, might now appear unworthy the gallantry and ſpirit of its author, if not too like the fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſource of diſappointed pride.—When the tempeſt had diſſevered the good old veſſel, deſpair might fly to any refuge.—The gilded lion at the head, was then no longer to be upheld, by romantic enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm, as the glittering ſign and ſplendid preſage of <hi>victory:</hi> diſtreſs and danger had deſtroyed all fanciful reſpect; and exhauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſinking, ſtrength caught at that majeſtic ruin, which, faithfull even to its debaſer, elevated and ſupported the very hand that ſelfiſhly depreſſed it.—It has had its uſe!—performed its ſervice!—Let it be no longer expoſed, and dragged about, for low mockery and inſolent profanation; but generouſly and gratefully <hi>laid up,</hi> like a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0698501300:100"/>tablet in the temple of Neptune, the conſecrated record of unhoped-for refuge.</p>
                  <p>It remains only to ſay a few words on the laſt and powerful argument for the Change of Miniſtry; namely, the deciſive ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of abilities, on the part of Oppoſition—this favourite <hi>common place,</hi> ſo perpetually, and ſo modeſtly urged, might lead to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal parallels, of all others the moſt invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, as well as diſputable.—On this queſtion, every man muſt judge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.—All that ſhall be ſaid here— is this; that it muſt indeed be a much more infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſuperiority of talent, than frequently occurs in the ſcale of human underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that can, at once, render the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of any ſet of men (who are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively unconverſant with official buſineſs, or, at leaſt, not equally verſed of late years in political negociations, foreign, or domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic;) ſo ſupremely ſuperexcellent to thoſe of others, ſome of whom have been literally educated in office, others paſſed the greateſt part of their lives in foreign embaſſies of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0698501300:101"/>complicated concern, with the ableſt, and pureſt reputation; and all are perfectly <hi>equal</hi> to their competitors in every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of rank and ſituation.—To this the thouſand declamatory common place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of practiſed fraud, veteran ſubtlety, and profeſſional treachery, as they may be eaſily imagined, ſhall be ſilently deſpiſed.—Certainly there are individuals in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, of moſt extenſive, and poſſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalled underſtanding, the acceſſion of whoſe abilities would give luſtre to public council, and be indeed almoſt a national bleſſing.—But if the miſerable appendages of party muſt for ever fix their ponderous and oppreſſive influence on talents formed for free, and bold aſpiring; then may their perverted excellence be juſtly pronounced the ruin of their country; and while, to vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar obſervation, this luminous and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant prodigy, this ſplendid, but baneful por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſcatters terror and amazement; by every more thinking mind, it will at once be wondered at, and lamented; admired, and deplored.—For pre-eminence of genius becomes doubly pernicious by the abuſe of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0698501300:102"/>its own ſuperiority, and the contaminating degradation of the faculties of others; and is indeed, both in effect, and by example,—The decay of a whole age.</p>
