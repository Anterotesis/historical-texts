            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN
ANSWER
TO A
QUESTION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THAT we are to have a Peace, or,
That the Peace is made, What
ſort of Peace, or How it has
been brought about; theſe are
Queſtions the World begins to have done
with, they have been ſo much, ſo often,
and to ſo little purpoſe banded about, and
toſs'd like a Shuttlecock, from one Party
to another; the Parties themſelves begin
to want Breath to rail and throw Scandal.
<hi>Roper</hi> and <hi>Ridpath,</hi> like two <hi>Tom T—men,</hi>
have thrown Night-Dirt at one another
ſo long, and grop'd into ſo many Jakes's
up to their Elbows to find it, that they
ſtink now in the Noſtrils of their own
Party. They are become perfectly nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous
to read; the Nation is ſurfeited
of them, and the People begin to be tired
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1150801800:3"/>
with ill uſing one another. Would any
tolerable Face appear upon things, we
might expect the People would be inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be eaſie; and were the Eyes of ſome
Great Men open, they may ſee this was
the Opportunity they never had before, to
make the Nation eaſie, and themſelves
ſafe. The main thing which agitates the
Minds of Men now, is the Proteſtant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
and the Pretender. Much Pains
have been taken on both ſides to amuſe
the World about this remaining Diſpute;
one ſide to make us believe it is ſafe, and
the other to convince us it is in Danger.
Neither ſide hath been able to expatiate
upon the Part they affirm. Thoſe who
ſay, the Proteſtant Succeſſion is ſecure,
have not yet ſhewn us any Step taken
ſince theſe New Tranſactions, for its
particular Security. Thoſe who ſay it is
in danger, have not ſo clearly determined
even among themſelves, from what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Head of Publick Management that
Danger chiefly proceeds. Both theſe Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties
ſerve to perplex us, and to
leave the thing more undetermined than
conſiſts with the publick Eaſe of the
Peoples Minds. To contribute ſomething
to that Eaſe, and bring thoſe whoſe Place
it is, to conſider of Ways to make the
People eaſie in this Caſe, this Work is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1150801800:4"/>
made Publick. Poſſibly the Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
may not meet with a Categorical
Anſwer. But this is certain, it ſhall ſhew
you more Directly what is the chief
Queſtion which the ſubſtance of Things
before us is like to turn upon; and to
which all our Queſtions ſeem to Tend.
Were the great Difficulty of the Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
brought to a narrow Compaſs, tho'
we might ſpend fewer Words about it, we
ſhould ſooner come to a direct Anſwer.
Before I come to the Great and chief
Queſtion upon which this Affair ſo much
ſeems to Turn, it ſeems needful to put the
previous Queſtion upon which ſo much
Debate has been among us, and let that be
Examined. This previous Queſtion is this:
Is there any real Danger of the Proteſtant
Succeſſion? Is there any Danger that the
Pretender ſhall be brought in upon us?
Is there any Danger of Popery, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
by Reſtoring the Son, <hi>as they call
him,</hi> of Abdicated King <hi>James?</hi> This is
the previous Queſtion, as we may now
call it. It is well known that there are
ſome People among us, who are ſo far
from allowing that there is any ſuch Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
as the ſaid Queſtion mentions, that
they will have it be a Token of Diſaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Government to put the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and are for loading whoever ſhall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1150801800:5"/>
offer to Start ſuch a Queſtion, with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
and Patry-Marks odious to good
Men; ſuch as Incendiary, Promoter of
Diſcontents, Raiſer of Faction, Divider of
the People, and the like: Names which
the Writer of theſe Sheets, at the ſame
time, both contemns and abhors. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee that he is any Enemy to the
Queen, in Inquiring as diligently as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
whether there are any Attempts to
Depoſe Her, or dangerous Proſpects of
bringing in the hated Rival of Her Glory
and Dominion. It is ſo far from that, that
it is apparently the Duty of every true
Subject of Her Majeſty, to Inquire ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly,
whether the publick Peace, the
Queen's Safety, Her Throne, or Her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is in any Danger from the wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of Her, and Her Peoples Enemies.
Wherefore, and for the joint Concern eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Proteſtant <hi>Britain,</hi> has in this thing;
I ſhall make no Difficulty, plainly and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
to State, and to Anſwer this previous
Queſtion, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Whether there is any
Danger of the Proteſtant Succeſſion, from
the preſent Meaſures, and from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
People concern'd? I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of what has been ſaid by ſome, to
prove that the preſent Miniſtry cannot be
ſuſpected of having any View to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
in any of their Meaſures. The
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1150801800:6"/>
beſt Reaſon which I have ſeen given upon
that Subject, is, that it is not their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt;
and that as we have not found them
Fools that are blind to their own Intereſt;
that either do not underſtand, or purſue
it. This we find handled ſundry ways,
by ſundry Authors, and very much Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
upon as a Foundation ſor us to build
upon. We ſhall give our Thoughts upon
it with plainneſs, and without Fear, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
Good Manners requires we ſhould
ſpeak of the Miniſtry with all due regard
to their Character and Perſons. This is a
Tract, deſign'd to Inquire ſeriouſly of a
Weighty and Eſſential, not a trifling
Thing, which requires but a trifling Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination;
nor ſhall it be handled here
with Satyr and Scurrility. We Approve
neither of the Flatteries of one ſide, or
the Inſultings of the other. We ſhall
readily and moſt willingly Joyn with thoſe
who are of Opinion, that it is not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the Miniſtry to be for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender;
and that the Miniſtry are not
blind to, or careleſs of their own Intereſt;
and Conſequently, that the Miniſtry can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be for the Pretender. This I hope
may be called a direct Anſwer. When I
ſay, <hi>Cannot,</hi> I muſt not, be underſtood po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially,
that they have no Moral Capacity;
But they cannot without ſuch Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1150801800:7"/>
Contradictions and Improbable
things happening in, which render it
highly Irrational, ſo much us to ſuppoſe
it of them. To ſhut the Door againſt any
poſſibility of Cavil, It may be needful al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to take it with us as we go, what we
mean by the Words <hi>be for</hi> the Pretender;
and this can be no otherwiſe underſtood,
than to have a Deſign however remote,
and upon whatever Views to bring him in
to poſſeſs the Throne of theſe Kingdoms.
The matter then being laid down thus, as
ſincerely and plainly as poſſible; we
come to the Queſtion point-blank, and
think it our Duty to ſay with the greateſt
Sincerity, that we do not believe the
Miniſtry are in any Kind, or with any
Proſpect near, or remote, Acting for, or
with a Deſign or View to bring in the
Pretender. Having granted this, we muſt
however, to prevent any Breaking in by
way of Cavil on one Hand, or Triumph
on the other; ſubjoyn immediately, that
we do not in the leaſt Grant by this, that
the Proteſtant Succeſſion is in no Danger,
even from ſeveral of the Meaſures now
taken in the World. It is far from any
Reflection upon the Miniſtry, to ſay, that
however they may Act upon a right
ſincere Principle for the Proteſtant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
in all they do, which, as above
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1150801800:8"/>
we profeſs to believe. Yet that many of
the Tools they make uſe of, are of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Make, and have no Edge to cut
any other way; no Thoughts to move
them towards any other End; no other
Center, which they can have any Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to; that the Pretender's Intereſt is the
Magnet, which draws them by its ſecret
Influence, to point to him as their Pole;
that they have their Aim at his Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
here, and own it to be their Aim:
And as they are not Shy to proſeſs it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves; ſo their Conduct in
many things makes it ſufficiently publick.
This is not meant as any Reflection upon
the Miniſtry, for making uſe of ſuch
Men: The late Miniſtry did the ſame, and
every Miniſtry will, and muſt Employ Men
ſometimes, not as they always Joyn with
them in their politic Principles; but
as either the Men are found uſeful in
their ſeveral Employments, or as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
may be under other Circumſtances,
which makes it Neceſſary to them to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
them. Nor, as the <hi>Review</hi> well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
obſerv'd, does it follow that <hi>becauſe
the Miniſtry have Employ'd, or Joyn'd with</hi>
Jacobites <hi>in the publick Affairs, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they muſt have done it with a</hi> Jacobite
<hi>Principle.</hi> But let the Miniſtry Employ
theſe Men by what Neceſſity, or upon what
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1150801800:9"/>
Occaſion they will, tho' it may not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that the Miniſtry are therefore for <hi>the
Pretender,</hi> yet it does not alſo follow that
there is no Danger of the Proteſtant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
from the Employing thoſe ſort of
People: <hi>For what if the Queen ſhould
Die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Miniſtry, it is hoped, are Eſtabliſhed
in the Intereſt of their Queen and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and therefore it has been Argued, that
ſuppoſing the Miniſtry had the Pretender
in their Eye, yet that it is Irrational to
ſuggeſt that they can have any ſuch View
during the Life of Her preſent Majeſty.
Nay, even thoſe profeſt <hi>Jacobites,</hi> who
we ſpoke of juſt now, cannot be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
to think of Depoſing the Queen,
who has been ſo Bountiful, ſo Kind, ſo
exceeding Good to them, as in ſeveral
Caſes to ſuffer them to be brought into
the Management of Her own Affairs,
when by their Character they might have
been thought Dangerous, even to Her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
thus Winning and Engaging them
by Her Bounty, and the Confidence that
has been plac'd in them, not to Attempt
any thing to Her prejudice, without the
moſt Monſtrous Ingratitude, without fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Face of all that Senſe of Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and Obligation which it is poſſible
for Men of common Senſe to entertain.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1150801800:10"/>
And it can hradly be thought, that even Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
themſelves under the higheſt poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their Religious Zeal, can Conquer
the Native Averſions they muſt have to
ſuch abominable Ingratitude, or to think
of bringing in the Pretender upon this
Proteſtant Nation, even while the Queen
ſhall be on the Throne. But tho' this
may, <hi>and ſome doubt that alſo,</hi> tye up their
Hands during the Queen's Life, yet they
themſelves give us but ſmall Reaſon to
expect any thing from them afterward;
and it will be hard to find any body to
Vouch for them then. Theſe very <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,
Papiſts,</hi> and profeſt Enemies to the
Revolution may be ſuppoſed upon theſe
Pretentions to be Quiet, and offer no
Violence to the preſent Eſtabliſhment
while Her Majeſty has the Poſſeſſion, and
while that Life laſts, to which they are ſo
much Indebted for Her Royal Goodneſs
and Clemency. <hi>But what would they do, if
the Queen ſhould die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Come we next to the <hi>French King.</hi> We
are told, that not the <hi>French King</hi> only, but
even the whole <hi>French Nation</hi> are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

the War; a War which lay Heavy upon
them, and Threaten'd the very Name of
the <hi>French Nation</hi> with Ruin, and much
more Threatn'd the Glory of the <hi>French
Court,</hi> and of their Great Monarch with
an entire Overthrow, a total Eclipſe. A
War, which by their own Confeſſion, it was
Impoſſible for them long to have ſupported
the Expences of, and which by the great
Superiority of the <hi>Allies,</hi> became Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to them, and that every Campaign
more than other; a War which they were
in ſuch Pain to ſee the End of, that they
tried all the Powers and Courts in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
who were the leaſt Neutral, to
Engage a Mediation in order to a Treaty,
and all in vain; and a War, which if Her
Majeſty had not Enclin'd to put an End
to, muſt have Ended perhaps to the
Diſadvantage, and Confuſion of both
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> if not of all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
The Obligations the <hi>French</hi> are
under for the bringing this War to ſo juſt
and Honourable a Concluſion, are not at
all Concealed. Nay, the <hi>Freuch</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
have not been backward to make
them publick. The Declarations made by
the <hi>Freuch King</hi> of his Sincerity in the
Overtures made for a General Peace, the
Proteſtations of his being reſolved to Enter
into an entire Confidence, and a League
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1150801800:14"/>
Offenſive and Defenſive with the Queen's
Majeſty, for the Preſervation of the Peace
of Chriſtendom, his Recognition of Her
Majeſty's juſt Right to the Crown, his
entring into Articles to preſerve the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
acknowledging the Ninth Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
in favour of the Houſe of <hi>Hanover,</hi>
and joining in the Great Affair of the
Proteſtant Succeſſion. As theſe all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the World of the Neceſſity his
Affairs were reduced to, and the great
Advantages accruing to him by a Peace;
ſo they ſeem to be ſo many Arguments
againſt our Fears of the <hi>French</hi> entring
into any Engagements againſt the Crown
of <hi>Britain,</hi> much leſs any againſt the
Poſſeſſion of the Queen during her Life.
Not that the Honour and Sincerity of
the King of <hi>France</hi> is a Foundation fit
for her Majeſty or her People to have
any Dependance upon; and the Fraction
of Former Treaties by that Court when
the Glory of that Monarch, or his
particular Views of things has dictated
ſuch Opportunity to him as he thought
fit to cloſe with, are due Cautions to us
all not to have any Dependance of that
kind. But the State of his Affairs, and
the Condition the War has reduced
him to, may give us ſome Ground to think
our ſelves ſafe on that ſide. He knows
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1150801800:15"/>
what Power he has taken off from his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in making Peace with Her Majeſty;
he knows very well with what loſs he ſits
down, how his Affairs are weaken'd, and
what need he has to take Breath after ſo
terrible a War; beſides the Flame ſuch an
Action would kindle again in <hi>Europe;</hi>
how it would Animate this whole <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Nation againſt him, in ſuch a manner, and
Endanger bringing in a new War, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a new Confederacy upon him ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,
and that before he would be in
a Condition to Match them; that no one
can reaſonably ſuppoſe the <hi>French</hi> King will
run the hazard of it. And theſe things may
Tend to make ſome People eaſier than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
in the Affair of the Succeſſion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that the <hi>French</hi> King ſtands in
too much need of the Favour of the Queen
of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> whoſe Power it well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves
him to keep in Friendſhip with him,
and whoſe Nation he will be very Cautious
of provoking a third time, as he has already
done twice to his fatal Experience. All
theſe things, we ſay, may ſeem pretty well
to aſſure us that nothing is to be feared on
that ſide ſo long as Her Majeſty lives to ſit
upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Throne. But all leaves
our Grand Queſtion unanſwered; and tho'
we may Argue ſtrongly for the <hi>French</hi>
King's Conduct while the preſent Reign
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1150801800:16"/>
continues, yet few will ſay, <hi>What he will
do if the Queen ſhould die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, we may even mention the <hi>Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
himſelf, if he has any about him whoſe
Councils are fit to be Depended upon, and
can Direct him to make a Wiſe and prudent
Judgment of his own Affairs; if he Acts by
any Scope of Policy, and can take his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
with any foreſight; moſt eaſie it is
for them to ſee that it muſt be in vain for
him to think of making any Attempt in
<hi>Britain,</hi> during the Life of the Queen;
or to expect to Deſpoſe Her Majeſty, and
ſet himſelf up. The <hi>French</hi> Power, upon
which he has already in vain Depended, as
it has not hitherto been able to ſerve him,
or, his Father; but that their Exile has
continued now above Twenty four Years.
So much leſs can he be able to Aſſiſt him
now while he has been brought as it were
to Kneel to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Court, to put an
End for him to this cruel deſtructive War;
The Reaſon is juſt ſpoken to, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that
this would be to rekindle that Flame, which
he has gotten ſo lately Quenched, and
which Coſt him ſo much Art, ſo much
Management, ſo much Submiſſion to the
<hi>Allies</hi> to Endeavour the Quenching of
before. To Attack the Queen of <hi>Great
Britain</hi> now in behalf of the <hi>Pretender,</hi>
would not only be in the higheſt Degree
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1150801800:17"/>
Ungrateful, Perfidious, and Diſhonourable;
but would for ever make the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Court
as well as the whole Nation, his Violent
and Implacable Enemies; but would alſo
Involve him again in a new War with all
<hi>Europe,</hi> who would very gladly Fall in
again with <hi>Britain</hi> to pull down more
Effectually the <hi>French</hi> Power, which has
ſo long been a Terror to its Neighbours.
So that the <hi>Pretender</hi> can Expect no Help
from the King of <hi>France.</hi> As to what the
<hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and a few petty <hi>Popiſh</hi>
Powers, who might pretend upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
proſpect to Aſſiſt him, and with
whoſe Aid, and the Aſſiſtance of his Party
here, he may think fit to hazard an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
here for the Crown; it is Evident,
and his own Friends will agree in it, that
while the Queen lives, it is Nonſcence, and
Ridiculous for them to Attempt it; that it
would immediately Arm the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt them, as one Man; and in
Humane probability, it would; like as
his ſuppoſed Father was ſerv'd at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
be the Ruin of his whole Intereſt,
and blow him at once quite out of the
Nation. I believe that there are
very few who Alarm themſelves much
with the Fears of the <hi>Pretender,</hi> from the
Apprehenſion of his own ſtrength from
Abroad, or from his own Party and Friends
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1150801800:18"/>
at Home here, were they once ſure that
he ſhould receive no Aſſiſtance from the
King of <hi>France.</hi> If then the King of <hi>France</hi>
cannot be reaſonably ſuppoſed either to be
Inclin'd, or be in a Conditon to Appear
for him, or Act in his behalf during the
Life of the Queen; neither can the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender,
<hi>ſay ſome,</hi> unleſs he is reſolved to
Ruin all his Friends, and at laſt to Ruin
himſelf, make any Attempt of that Kind
during Her Majeſty's Life. <hi>But what if
the Queen ſhould die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having then View'd the ſeveral Points
of the Nation's Compaſs, whence our Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of <hi>Jacobite</hi> Plots, and Projects againſt
the Proteſtant Succeſſion may be expected
to come; Let us now Enquire a little of
the State of the Nation, that we make a
right Eſtimate of our Condition, and may
know what to truſt to in Caſes of Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
as they lye before us. In doing
this, as well to avoid giving offence to the
People now in Power, as to the Entring
into the Quarrels which Engage the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
contending Parties in this Divided
Nation; we ſhall allow, however ſome
may think fit to Queſtion it, the main De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;
and Grant this for the preſent as a
Fundamental, (<hi>viz.) That we are in no
Danger</hi> of the Pretender, <hi>during this Queen's
Reign,</hi> or <hi>during this Miniſtry's Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1150801800:19"/>
under Her Majeſty;</hi> and avoiding
all Contention of that Kind, ſhall allow
our Condition to be <hi>SAFE</hi> in every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
as we go along, <hi>for ſo long as the Queen
Lives,</hi> referring the Obſervation of things
in every Head, to thoſe who can Anſwer
the main Queſtion in our Title, (<hi>viz.) But
what if the Queen ſhould die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt of all, it may be Noticed, that
the preſent Safety of this Nation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we reſpect Liberty, Religion, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
or publick Safety and Proſperity,
Depends upon this one Fundamental,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) That <hi>alluding reverently to that Text
of Scripture,</hi> we are all built upon the
Foundation of the late Revolution, <hi>Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht
Law</hi> and <hi>Right,</hi> being the <hi>chief
Corner-Stone.</hi> By this it is, that Her
Majeſty is made our Queen, the Entail of
the Crown being reſerv'd in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to Her Majeſty in the Act of Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made at the filling up the vacant
Throne, and by all thoſe ſubſequent Acts,
which Her Majeſty's Title was Confirm'd
by, during the Life of the Late King. <hi>This
Revolution,</hi> is that upon which the
Liberties and Religion of this Nation,
were Re-built after the Conflagration
that was made of them in the Calamitous
Times of King <hi>Charles</hi> II, and King <hi>James</hi> II.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1150801800:20"/>
and from hence to the Love of Liberty,
which is found almoſt to be Naturally
plac'd in the Hearts of true <hi>Britains;</hi> and
upon the View whereof they have acted
all along in the Late War, and in all their
Tranſactions at Home has obtained the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of a <hi>REVOLUTION PRINCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE.</hi>
Noting this then, as above, that
Her Majeſty is our Queen by vertue of
the Revolution, and that during Her
Reign, that Eſtabliſhment alone muſt be
the Foundation of all Her Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
this muſt effectually Secure us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
any Apprehenſion that the Perſons
acting under Her Majeſty, can Act in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the <hi>Pretender,</hi> during Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Life; for that they muſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
Overthrow the Throne, Turn the
Queen out of it, and Renounce the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
upon which Her Majeſty's Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
is Eſtabliſhed: As the Revolution
therefore is the Baſe upon which the Throne
of Her Majeſty's Poſſeſſion is Eſtabliſhed;
ſo her Majeſty, and all that Act under her,
are obliged to Act upon the Foot of the
ſaid Revolution, even <hi>Will</hi> they, <hi>Nil</hi> they;
or elſe they ſink immediately out of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Power to Act at all; Her Majeſty's
Title would fall to the Ground, their own
Commiſſions would from that Hour be
Void; they muſt Declare their Royal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1150801800:21"/>
and Benefactreſs, a Subject to the
<hi>Pretender,</hi> and all Her Pretences of Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Poſſeſſion, Injurious, and an Uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Theſe things being ſo plain, that
he that runs may read them, ſeem to ſtop
all our Mouths from ſo much as any Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion,
that any Body can Attempt to
bring in the <hi>Pretender</hi> upon us during the
the Life of Her preſent Majeſty. <hi>But
what if the Queen ſhould die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Subſequent to the Revolution, many
Eſſential things are form'd by our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Government for the publick
Good, on the Foundation of which much
of the preſent Peace of the Nation is
Founded; and while the ſaid Revolution
Foundation ſtands faſt, there is good
Ground to believe thoſe Eſſential Points
ſhall be preſerved. If then we are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that the Revolution Principle ſhall
ſubſiſt as long as the Queen Lives, then
for ſo long we may have good Ground
to believe we ſhall Enjoy all thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
and Benefits which we received
from the ſaid Revolution. But ſtill when
we look back upon thoſe dear Privileges,
the obtaining of which has Coſt ſo much
Money, and the Maintaining of which
has Coſt ſo much Blood, we muſt with
a deep Sigh reflect upon the precarious
Circumſtances of the Nation, whoſe beſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1150801800:22"/>
Privileges hang uncertain upon the Nice
and tender Thread of Royal Mortality,
and ſay, we are happy while theſe laſt, and
theſe may laſt while Her Majeſty ſhall
Live. <hi>But what if the Queen ſhould
die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us Deſcend to ſome other Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of thoſe Bleſſings which we do Enjoy
purely as the Effect of the Revolution,
and Examin in what Poſture we ſtand,
with reſpect to them, and what Aſſurance
we have of their Continuance: And Firſt,
as to <hi>TOLERATION.</hi> This was the
Greateſt and firſt Bleſſing the Nation felt
after the immediate Settlement of the
Crown, which was Eſtabliſhed by Vertue
of the Revolution Engagement, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Declaration.
The Deſign of this Law, as it was to
give Liberty for the Worſhip of God to ſuch
Diſſenters as could not Conform to the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to give Eaſe to
tender Conſciences, ſo as by the Law it
ſelf is expreſſed; it was to Eaſe the Minds
of their Majeſty's Subjects, and to give
general Quiet to the Nation, whoſe Peace
had been frequently Diſturbed by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Perſecution. We have ſeen fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Aſſurances given of the Inviolable
Preſervation of this Toleration by Her
Majeſty from the Throne in Her Speeches
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1150801800:23"/>
to the Parliament; and during Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Reign, we have great Reaſon to
hope the Quiet of the poor People ſhall
not be broken by either repealing that Law,
or Invading the Intent and Meaning of
it while it remains in Force; and there is a
great many Reaſons to hope that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Miniſtry are ſo far Convinc'd of the
Neceſſity of the ſaid Toleration in order to
preſerve the Peace, and the common
Neighbourhood of People, that they can
have no Thought of Breaking in upon it;
or any way making the People, who En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
it, uneaſie. Nay, the rather we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this, becauſe the Ferment ſuch a
Breach would put the whole Nation into,
is not the ſafeſt Condition the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can be in upon any Account; And as
the Miniſtry cannot be ſuppoſed to deſire
to give Uneaſineſs and Provocation to the
Commons, but rather to keep them Eaſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Death; and when Popiſh Pretenders, and
<hi>French</hi> Influencies ſhall prevail, it may
well be expected then, that not Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Diſſenters only, but even of the
whole Proteſtant Religion may be in
danger to be Loſt; ſo that however ſecure
we are of the free Enjoyment of Liberty of
Religion during the Queen's Life, we may
be very well allow'd to ask this Queſtion
with reſpect to not Toleration only, but
the Church of <hi>England</hi> alſo, (<hi>viz.</hi>) what
will become of them, <hi>If the Queen ſhould
die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From Toleration in <hi>England,</hi> come we
to the Conſtitution of Religious Affairs in
<hi>Scotland;</hi> and here we have different Views
from what the Caſe in <hi>England</hi> affords us;
the powerful Intereſt of Jacobitiſm, if it
may be ſaid to be Formidable any where,
is ſo there. The Enemies of the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are all the Implacable Enemies of the
Church Eſtabliſhment there: Nay, many
Thouſands are the declared Enemies of
the Revolution, and of the Queen's being
upon the Throne, from a meer Implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Averſion to the <hi>Presbyterian Kirk,</hi>
which is Erected, and Eſtabliſhed by that
very Revolution which has ſet the Queen
upon the Throne. The <hi>Union,</hi> which has
yet farther Eſtabliſh'd that <hi>Prebeterian Kirk,</hi>
is for that Reaſon the Averſion of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1150801800:25"/>
ſame People, as it is the Averſion of the
<hi>Jacobites,</hi> by being a further Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Hannover</hi> Succeſſion, and a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fixing the Queen upon the Throne.
Now as <hi>it is ſure,</hi> that <hi>as before,</hi> while the
Queen Lives, and the Revolution Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
carries its uſual Force in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
now United, the <hi>Presbyterian Kirk</hi>
muſt and will remain, and all the little En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
which have been made upon
the <hi>Kirk,</hi> as it may be obſerved, tho' they
have created Uneaſineſs enough, yet they
ſtill ſeem to ſuppoſe that the Eſtabliſhment
it ſelf cannot be overthrown. The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and the Revolution Settlement remain
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and muſt remain, as is ſaid:
While the Queen Lives we can have no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of them; The Reaſons are
given above; and as we ſaid before, we are
to take them for granted in this Diſcourſe,
to avoid other Cavils. While then the
Revolution, and the Union are to be the
Foundation of the Adminiſtration in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Eſtabliſht Church
Government, there muſt alſo remain as
the only Legal <hi>Kirk</hi> Conſtitution, and ſo
long we can Entertain no Fears of any
thing on that Account. <hi>But what if the
Queen ſhould die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:1150801800:26"/>
From ſuch Religious Concerns as effect
<hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and other Sectaries, or <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi>
as we call them; let us take a
look at the remote Danger of the Church
of <hi>England.</hi> We have had a great deal of
Diſtraction in the time of the late Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
about the Danger of the Church;
and as it appears by the <hi>Memorial</hi> of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> publiſhed in thoſe
times, and Re-printed ſince; by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of Dr. <hi>Sacheverell,</hi> and the eminent
Speeches at his Trial, that Danger was
more eſpecially, Suggeſted to come from
the Encreaſe of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> here, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
of the <hi>Whiggs,</hi> and the Eſtabliſhing
<hi>Presbyterianiſm</hi> in the North of <hi>Britain.</hi>
Theſe things being in a great Meaſure
now overthrown by the late Change of
the Miniſtry, and the new Methods taken
in the Management of the publick Affairs;
the People who were then ſuppoſed to
Aim at overthrowing the Miniſtry of
thoſe <hi>Whiggs</hi> are pleaſed to aſſure us of
the Safety and flouriſhing Condition of
the Church, now more than ever; while
the other Party, taking up the like Cry
of the Danger of the Church, tell us, that
now a real viſible appearace of Danger to
the Church is before us; and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Church of <hi>England</hi> as ſuch, but
even to the whole Intereſt, and Safety of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1150801800:27"/>
the Proteſtant Religion in <hi>Britain;</hi> that this
Danger is imminent, and unavoidable from
the great Growth and Encreaſe of <hi>Popery,</hi>
and profeſt <hi>Jacobitiſm</hi> in the Nation. This
indeed they give but too great Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
of from the ſpreading of Popiſh
Agents among us, whoſe profeſt Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is to Amuſe, and Impoſe upon the
poor Country People, as well in Matters
of <hi>Jacobitiſm,</hi> as of Religion; and the great
Succeſs theſe Emiſſaries of Satan have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in ſeveral Parts of <hi>Britain;</hi> but
eſpecially in the North. Now tho' we
cannot but acknowledge, but that much of
this Alarm is juſtly Grounded, and that
the Endeavours of <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Jacobite</hi>
Agents, and Emiſſaries in diverſe Parts
of <hi>Britian,</hi> are too apparently Succeſsful;
yet as wiſe Men could never ſee into the
reality of ſuch Danger, as was by ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
pretended to be Impending over the
Church in the Time of the late Miniſtry;
So neither can we allow that Popery is ſo
Evidently at the Door at this Time, as
that we ſhould be Apprehenſive of having
the Church of <hi>England</hi> immediately Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd,
and the Proteſtant Religion in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:</hi>
And one great Reaſon for this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is, that Her Majeſty, who is a Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Profeſſor of the Proteſtant Religion,
and has been Bred up in the Boſom of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1150801800:28"/>
Church of <hi>England,</hi> is ſo Rooted in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and had Declared from Her very
Infancy ſuch Horror and Averſion to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
that it cannot Enter into any true
Proteſtant Thoughts to apprehend any
thing of that Kind, while Her Majeſty
lives. <hi>BUT</hi> Lord have Mercy upon
us! <hi>What if the Queen ſhould die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From Religious Matters, come we next
to conſider Civil Intereſt, Liberties, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
Properties; the Great Article that
in the late Revolution, went always
Coupled in the Nation's Negative, with
that of Religion, as if they were woven
together; and was always Cry'd upon by
the Mob in one Breath, (<hi>viz.</hi>) No <hi>Popery,</hi>
no <hi>Slavery.</hi> The firſt of theſe concerns
our Civil Intereſt; ſuch as the Publick
Credit, by the Occaſions of a long and
Expenſive War, and to prevent Levying
ſevere Taxes for the Carrying on the War,
ſuch as would be Grievous to Trade, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
to the Poor, and Difficult to be
Paid. The Parliament for the Eaſe of the
Subjects, thought fit, rather to lay Funds
of Intereſt to raiſe Money upon, by way
of Loan; Eſtabliſhing thoſe Intereſts, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as Annuities, and Annual Payments
for the Benefit of thoſe who Advanc'd their
Money for the publick Service. And to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1150801800:29"/>
make theſe things Current, that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Credit might be Sacred, and the
People be made free to Advance their
Money; all poſſible Aſſurances of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
have been given, that the Payments
of Intereſts, and Annuities ſhall be kept
punctually, and Exactly according to the
Acts of Parliament, that no Miſ-applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Money ſhall be made, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the Money received upon one,
to make good the Deficiency of the other;
and hitherto the Injunctions of that Kind
have been exactly obſerv'd, and the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
punctually made, which we call
the Credit of the Nation. At the firſt of
the late Change, when the New Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
began to Act, the Fright the People
were put in upon the Suggeſtion of ſome,
that all the Parliamentary Funds ſhould be
wiped off with a Spunge, was very Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
and the Credit of thoſe Funds ſunk
Exceedingly, with but the bare Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of ſuch a Blow; the Sums being
Infinitely great, and the Number of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Families being Incredibly many
whoſe whole Subſtance lay in thoſe Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
and whoſe Bread depended upon
thoſe Intereſts being punctually Paid:
But wiſer Men ſaw quickly there was
no Ground for thoſe Fears; that the New
Miniſtry ſtood upon a Foot that could no
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1150801800:30"/>
more be Supported without the publick
Credit, than thoſe that went before them;
that Eſpecially while they were under a
Neceſſity of Borrowing further Sums, they
behoved to Secure the punctual Paying of
the Old; and by making the People en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
Eaſie, not only take from them the
Apprehenſions they were under of Loſing
what they Lent already; but make them
forward, and willing to Advance more to
this Purpoſe. They not only Endeavoured
to give the People all poſſible Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that their Money was Safe, and that
the Funds laid by the Parliament in
the former Miniſtry, ſhould be kept Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
and the Payments punctually made;
but took care to obtain Parliamentary Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities,
by real Funds to be Settled for
the Payment of thoſe Debts contracted by
the former Miniſtry; and for which no
Proviſion was made before. This was the
Eſtabliſhment of a Fund for Payment of
the Intereſts of the <hi>Navy</hi> Debt, Ordnance,
Victualling, Tranſport, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of Seven or Eight Millions; which is
the Subſtance of what we now call the
South-Sea Stock. By this means the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Credit, which, it was Suggeſted, would
receive ſuch a Blow at the Change, as that
it ſhould never recover again; and that it
would be Impoſſible for the New Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1150801800:31"/>
to Raiſe any needful Sums of Money
for the Carrying on the War, or for the
publick Occaſions, recovered it ſelf ſo as
that the Government hath ever ſince found
it Eaſie to Borrow what ever Sums they
thought fit to Demand in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as before. Now that theſe Loans are
Safe, no Man that weighs the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the Miniſtry and Government,
and the Circumſtances of the People,
can Doubt; the firſt being in a conſtant
Neceſſity of Supporting the publick Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
for the Carrying on publick Affairs,
on any ſuddain Emergency that may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen;
and being liable to the Reſentment
of Parliament, if any open Infraction
ſhould be made upon the Funds, which
touches ſo nearly the Honour of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
and the Intereſt of moſt of the
beſt Families in the Nation. While this
is the Caſe, we think it is not Rational to
believe that any Miniſtry will venture to
attack Parliamentary Credit, in ſuch a
manner; and this will Eminently be the
Caſe as long as Her Majeſty ſits on the
Throne. Nor can a thing ſo bare-fac'dly
Tyrannical and Arbitrary, and above all
Diſhonourble and Unjuſt, be Suggeſted, as
poſſible to be Attempted in the Reign of
ſo Juſt and Conſciencious a Prince; So
that we may be very willing to allow that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1150801800:32"/>
there is not the leaſt Danger of the publick
Faith being Broken, the publick Credit
loſt, the publick Funds ſtopt, or the Money
being Miſ-apply'd. No Cheat, no Spunge
while Her Majeſty. <hi>BUT</hi> Alas for us!
<hi>What if the Queen ſhould die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this piece of Civil Right, come
we to thoſe Things we call Liberties, and
Privileges. Theſe may indeed be joyned
in ſome Reſpects; but as we are Engag'd
in ſpeaking particularly to ſuch Points,
wherein our preſent Dangers do, or do
not appear; It is proper to mention them
apart. <hi>Privileges</hi> may be diſtinguiſhed
here from Liberties, as they reſpect Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of Trade, Corporations, Parliaments,
and Legiſlature, <hi>&amp;c. Liberty,</hi> as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
Laws, Eſtabliſhments, declared Right,
and ſuch like. As to the firſt, from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
to this Time they have not
only been Confirm'd, which we had before;
but many Privileges added to the People;
Some of which are Eſſential to the well-being
of the Kingdom. All the <hi>Quo
Warranto's</hi> againſt Corporation Privileges,
the High-Commiſſion Court againſt the
Church's Privileges extending Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in Detriment of the Subjects natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Right; and many ſuch things, which
were Fatal to the Privileges of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1150801800:33"/>
Nation, were laid aſide, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their juſt Condemnation in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution;
and not ſo only, but the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
obtain'd ſince the Revolation by
Conſent of Parliament, are very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
ſuch as the Toleration to this part
of <hi>Britain,</hi> and the Eſtabliſhment of the
Church of <hi>Scotland:</hi> For the North part,
in matters of Religion; ſuch as the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennial
Election of Parliaments; In Civil
Affairs, ſuch as the ſeveral Corporations
Granted upon really uſeful Foundations
in Trade; as the <hi>Bank Company,</hi> &amp;c and
ſuch like. Theſe and many more, which
may be Named; and which theſe are
Named only as Heads of, are Secured to
us by Law; and thoſe Laws yet again
made ſure to us by the Honour and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity
of Her Majeſty, and as long as Her
Majeſty's Life is ſpared to theſe Nations,
we have great Reaſon to believe we ſhall
rather Encreaſe than Loſe our Privileges.
<hi>BUT what if the Queen ſhould die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>LIBERTIES,</hi> which come
next in Order may be Summ'd up in what
we call <hi>Legal,</hi> and <hi>Native</hi> Right; or
ſuch as by the natural Conſequence of
a Free Nation, and a juſt Government;
or ſuch as by mutual Aſſent and Conſent
of Soveraign and Subject, are become the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1150801800:34"/>
Legal Right of the latter. Theſe, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to be Enumerated here, are Summ'd
up into One; or are expreſly Enacted by
Statute Law, and thereby become Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to the Conſtitution. Theſe receive
no Wound, but one of theſe two ways, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by open Infraction, and Contempt of
Right, or by Diſpenſing Arbitrary Power;
both of which by the many Aſſurances
from the Throne, by the conſtant Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
of Parliaments, and the full Liberty
they have more of late, than ever, taken to
Examin into, and Cenſure Breaches of the
Laws: We are very well aſſured ſhall not
be Attempted in Her Majeſty's time: Nay,
on the contrary, the Superiority, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of Parliaments over and upon the
Management of publick Matters. Nay,
even their Influences upon the Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of the Soveraign, has been ſuch, and
has in ſuch a manner Inſenſibly Increaſed
of Late, that the like has never been
known, or Practiſed in this Nation for
ſome Ages before. We ſee Her Majeſty
declines Extending Her Perogative, either
to the Detriment of Her Subjects, in Caſes
Civil, or Religious; and wherein it might
be ſo Extended; nay, when even the
Parliament have deſir'd Her to Extend it:
So that we have a great Satisfaction in the
Safety of our Eſtabliſhed Liberties, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1150801800:35"/>
that no Tyrannical Arbitrary Invaſions of
Right ſhall be made during Her Majeſty's
Reign. <hi>BUT what if the Queen ſhould
die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner for our Properties, our
Eſtates, Inheritance, Lands, Goods, Lives,
Liberties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are effectually Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
by Laws of the Land, and the
Sovereign in this Counrty, having no
Right, but by Law to any part of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Eſtate, Cauſes that Eſtate to be called
<hi>PROPERTY.</hi> The Kings and Queens
of <hi>Britain</hi> are Monarchs limited to Act by
the Laws. When they Ceaſe to Rule by
Law, the Conſtitution is Broken, and
they become Tyrants and Arbitrary, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotick
Invaders of Right. This is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by the Revolution, wherein the
Right of the Subject are openly, not ſet
down only, but Claim'd, Demanded at
what Juſtice required ſhould be Granted
to them, and as what the Soveraign as
aforeſaid has no Right, no Pretence, no
juſt Authority to take, or detain from
him. This is the Great Capital and
Fundamental Article of <hi>Magna-Charta,</hi> and
the Foundation upon which all the Laws
Subſequent, and Conſequential to <hi>Magna-Charta</hi>
have been made [<hi>No freeman ſhall
be Taken or Impriſoned, or be Diſſeized of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1150801800:36"/>
his Freehold, or Liberties, or Free Cuſtoms,
or be Out-lawed, or Exiled, or otherwiſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed;
nor we will not paſs upon him, nor
Condemn him, but by Lawful Iudgement of
his Peers, or by the Law of the Land. <hi>Magna-Charta,</hi>
               </hi>
Cap. xxix.] The Words are
Plain and Direct; and as to the Subject, we
are now upon, they require no Comment,
no Explication. Whatever they do, as to
Pleading in Law; the Proof of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject's
Right to the free Poſſeſſion of his
own Property, is alſo the leſs needful to
Enlarge upon here, becauſe it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
in full, and expreſs Terms by the
Soveraign, as well in Practiſe, as in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.
Her Majeſty adhering ſtrictly
to this, as a Rule, has from the beginning
of Her Reign, made it Her <hi>Golden Rule,</hi>
to Govern according to Law. Nor while
the Eſtabliſhment of the Crown it ſelf is
Built upon the Legal Conſtitution of this
Nation, can it be otherwiſe here: That
Prince that Governs here and not by Law,
may be ſaid, rather to Oppreſs, than to
Govern, rather to Over-rule, than to Rule
over his People. <hi>NOW</hi> it cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great and unjuſtifyable Violence to
Her Majeſty's juſt Government, be Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted,
that we are in any Danger of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
during the Righteous Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Her Majeſty's Reign. The Queen
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1150801800:37"/>
Raiſes no Money without Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
keeps up no Standing Army in time
of <hi>Peace,</hi> Diſ-ſeizes no Man of his Property,
or Eſtate; but every Man Sits in Safety
under his own Vine, and his Fig-tree;
and we doubt not but we ſhall do as long
as Her Majeſty Lives. <hi>BUT what if the
Queen ſhould die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poſſibly Cavils may Riſe in the Mouths
of thoſe whoſe Conduct this Nice Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may ſeem to Affect, that this is a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
unfit to be asked, and Queſtionleſs
ſuch People will have much to ſay upon
that Subject; as that it is a Factious Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
a Queſtion Needleſs to be Anſwered,
and Impertinent therefore to be askt; that
it is a Queſtion which reſpects things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
and ſerves only to fill the Heads
of the People with Fears and Jealouſies;
that it is a Queſtion, to which no direct
Anſwer can be given, and which Suggeſts
ſtrange Surmiſes, and amuſes People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
they know not what, and is of no
uſe, but to make People uneaſie without
Cauſe.</p>
            <p>As there is no Objection, which is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
enough to make, but is Material
enough to Anſwer; ſo this, altho' there
is nothing of Subſtance in it, may
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1150801800:38"/>
Introduce ſomething in its Anſwer of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
enough to conſider: It is therefore
moſt neceſſary to Convince the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Reader of the Uſefulneſs and Neceſſity
of putting this Queſtion; and then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the Uſefulneſs, and Neceſſity of
putting this Queſtion <hi>NOW</hi> at this time;
and if it appear to be both a needful Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
it ſelf, and a ſeaſonable Queſtion,
as to time the reſt of the Cavils againſt, it
will deſerve the leſs regard. That it is a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Queſtion, ſeems juſtified more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
from a very great Example, to wit,
the Practiſe of the whole Nation, in Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
the Succeſſion to the Crown. This
I take to be nothing elſe, but this: The
Queen having no Iſſue of Her Body, and
the Pretender to the Crown being Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
by Law, Included in his Father's
Diſaſtrous Flight, and Abdication; when
the Parliament came to Conſider of the
State of the Nation, as to Government
as it now ſtands; that King <hi>William</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lately Dead, and Her Majeſty with
univerſal Joy of Her People, being reciev'd
as Queen, the Safety, and the laſting
Happineſs of the Nation is ſo far Secur'd
<hi>BUT what if the Queen ſhould die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Introduction to all the Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
for Settling the Crown, Implies
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1150801800:39"/>
thus much, and ſpeaks directly this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
(<hi>viz.</hi>) to make the Nation Safe and
Eaſie, in Caſe the Queen ſhould die: Nor are
any of thoſe Acts of Parliament Impeach'd
of Faction, or Impertinencies; much leſs
of Needleſs blaming the People, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
their Heads with Fears and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.
If this Example of the Parliament
is not enough, Juſtifying to this Enquiry
the well known Truth, upon which that
Example of Parliament is Grounded, is
ſufficient to juſtifie it, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That we all
known the Queen <hi>MUST die.</hi> None
ſay, this with more Concern and Regret,
than thoſe who are forwardeſt to put this
Queſtion, as being of the Opinion above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
that we are effectually Secured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Pretender, and againſt all the
terrifying Conſequences of the <hi>Frenchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd</hi>
Govournours during Her Majeſty's
Life. But this is Evident, <hi>the Queen is
Mortal,</hi> tho' crown'd with all that Flattering
Courtiers can bring together, to make
Her appear Great, Glorious, Famous, or
what you pleaſe; yet the Queen, yea, the
Queen Her ſelf is. <hi>Mortal,</hi> and <hi>MUST
die.</hi> It is true, Kings and Queens are
called Gods; but this reſpects their Sacred
Power: nothing ſuppoſing and Immortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
attending their Perſons, for they all
<hi>Die</hi> like other Men, and their Duſt knows
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1150801800:40"/>
no Diſtinction in the Grave. Since then it
is moſt certain that the Queen <hi>MUST
die,</hi> and our Safety, and Happineſs in this
Nation depends ſo much upon the Stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of our Liberties, Religion, and afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Dependencies after Her Majeſty's
Life ſhall End, it cannot be a Queſtion
Offenſive to any who has any Concern
in the Publick good, to enquire into what
ſhall be the State of our Condition,
or the Poſture of our Affairs, when the
Queen ſhall die; <hi>but this is not all neither.</hi>
As the Queen is Mortal, and we are
aſſured ſhe muſt die; ſo we are none of
us certain, as to be able to know when,
or how ſoon that Diſaſter may happen,
at what time, or in what manner. This
then, as it may be remote, and not a long
time; <hi>God of his Infinite Mercy grant it
may be long firſt, and not before this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
Queſtion we are upon, be Effectually and
Satisfactorily Anſwered to the Nation:</hi> So
on the other ſide, it may be <hi>near;</hi> None
of us know how <hi>near</hi> the fatal Blow may
befal us ſoon, and ſooner far than we may
be ready; for to day it may come, while
the cavilling Reader is objecting againſt
our putting this Queſtion, and calling it
Unreaſonable and Needleſs; while the Word
is in thy very Mouth, mayeſt thou hear
the fatal Melancholly News, <hi>the Queen's
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1150801800:41"/>
Dead.</hi> News that muſt one time, or
other be heard; the Word will certainly
come ſome time, or other, to be ſpoken in
the preſent Senſe, and to be ſure in the
time they are ſpoken in. How can any
one then ſay, that it is improper to
ask what ſhall be our Caſe, what ſhall we
do, or what ſhall be done with us <hi>if the
Queen ſhould die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we have an other Melancholy
Incident, which attends the Queen's Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
and which makes this Queſtion
more than ordinarily ſeaſonable to be
ask'd at this time; and that is, that not only
the Queen is Mortal, and ſhe <hi>MUST
die,</hi> and the time uncertain; ſo that ſhe
<hi>may die,</hi> even to Day before to Morrow,
or in a very little ſpace of time: But Her
Life is under God's Providence, at the
Mercy of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Jacobites</hi> People;
who the one by their Principles, and the
other by the Circumſtances of their Party
are more than ordinarily to be Apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for their bloody Deſigns againſt Her
Majeſty, and againſt the whole Nation.
Nay, there ſeems more Reaſon to be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
of the dangerous Attempts of
theſe deſperate People, at this time, than
ever, even from the very Reaſons which
are given all along in this Work, for our
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1150801800:42"/>
being Safe in our Privileges, our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Civil Rights during Her Majeſty's
Life; it would be miſpending your time
prove to that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Jacobite</hi> Parties
in this Nation, however they may, as we
have ſaid, be under Tyes and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Honour, Intereſt, and Gratitude,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not to make attempt upon us during
the Queen's Life; yet that they are more
Encouraged at this time than ever they
were to hope and believe, that when the
Queen ſhall die, their Turn ſtands next.
This we ſay, we believe is loſt Labour to
ſpeak of: The ſaid People, the <hi>Popiſh</hi> and
<hi>Tory</hi> Party will freely own and oppoſe it.
They all take their Obligations to the
Queen, to End with Her Majeſty's Life.
The <hi>French King,</hi> however in Honour, and
Gratitude he may think himſelf bound to
Encourage the <hi>Pretender</hi> to inſult Her
Majeſty's Dominions, while the Queen
with whom he Perſonally is Engaged by
Treaty, ſhall remain alive, will think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
fully at Liberty from thoſe Obligations
when the Queen ſhall die. If we are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inform'd
of the <hi>French</hi> Affairs, and of the
Notions, they have in <hi>France</hi> of theſe things,
they are generally no otherwiſe underſtood
then that the King of <hi>France</hi> is Engag'd by
the Peace now in View, not to diſturb Her
Majeſty's Poſſeſſion during Her Reign,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1150801800:43"/>
and Life; but that then the <hi>Pretender's</hi>
Right is to be receiv'd every where. The
<hi>Pretender</hi> himſelf, howſoever, as aboveſaid,
he may deſpair of his Succeſs in Attempting
to take Poſſeſſion during the Queen's Life,
will not fail to aſſume new Hopes at Her
Majeſty's Death: So much then of the
hopes of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Power; ſo
much of the Intereſt of the <hi>Pretender</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon the ſingle Thread of Life
of a Mortal Perſon; and we being well
aſſur'd that they look upon Her Majeſty,
only as the Incumbent in a Living, or
Tenant for Life in an Eſtate, what is more
Natural, than in this Caſe for us to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
Danger to the Life of the Queen;
Eſpecially to ſuch People, who are known
not to make much Conſciencies of Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Princes, with whom the King killing
Doctrine is ſo Univerſally receiv'd, and
who were ſo often Detected of villanious
Practices, and Plots againſt the Life of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Her Majeſty's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Predeceſſor, and that upon the ſame
Foundation, (<hi>viz.</hi>) The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi>
being the <hi>Popiſh Pretender</hi> to the Crown;
what can we expect from the ſame Party,
and Men acting from the ſame Principles;
but the ſame Practices. It is known that
the Queen by Courſe of Nature may Live
many Years, and theſe People have many
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1150801800:44"/>
Reaſons to be Impatient of ſo much Delay.
They know that many Accidents may
Intervene to make the Circumſtances of
the Nation at the Time of the Queen's
Death, leſs favourable to their Intereſts
than they are now; they may have fewer
Friends, as well in Power, as out of Power
by length of time, and the like: Theſe,
and ſuch as theſe Conſiderations may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
Vilanious and Murtherous Practices
againſt the precious Life of our Soveraign
(God protect Her Majeſty from them)
but while all theſe Conſiderations ſo Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
offer themſelves to us, it ſeems moſt
Rational needful, ſeaſonable and juſt, that
we ſhould be Asking and Anſwering this
great Queſtion, <hi>What if the Queen ſhould
die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far we have only asked the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
it ſelf, and ſhewed our Reaſons, or
Endeavoured to Juſtifie the Reaſonablneſs
of the Enquiry. It follows that we make
ſome brief Eſſay as an Anſwer to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
This may be done many ways; but
the Deſign of this Tract is rather to put
the Queſtion into your Thought, than to
put an Anſwer into your Mouths. The
ſeveral Anſwers which may be given to
this Important Queſtion may not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for a publick Print; and ſome may
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1150801800:45"/>
not be fit ſo much as to be ſpoken. The
Queſtion is not without its Uſes, whether
it be Anſwered or no, if the Nation be
ſufficiently Awaken'd; but to ask the
Queſtion among themſelves, they will be
brought by thinking of the thing to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
it one to another in a ſhort Space
The People of <hi>Britain,</hi> want only to be
ſhewed what imminent Danger they are
in, in Caſe of the Queen's Deceaſe: How
much their Safety and Felicity depends
upon the Life of Her Majeſty, and what
a State of Confuſion, Diſtreſſ, and all
Sorts of dreadful Calamities they will fall
into at Her Majeſty's Death, if ſomething
be not done to Settle them before Her
Death; and if they are not during Her
Majeſty's Life ſecured from the Power of
