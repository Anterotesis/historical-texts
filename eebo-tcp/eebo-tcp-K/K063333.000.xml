            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>For the Encouragement of ſo uſeful a Work, it is

has with great Care perus'd the <hi>Manuſcript.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Author, in his Preface, makes
ſome very judicious Reflexions upon
the Original of Arts and Sciences; That at
firſt they conſiſt of ſcatter'd Theorems and
Practices, which are handed about amongſt
the Maſters, and only reveal'd to the <hi>Filii
Artis,</hi> till ſuch time as ſome great Genius
appears, who Collects theſe disjointed Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
and reduces them into a regular Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem.
That this is the Caſe of that Noble
and Uſeful Art of <hi>Political Lying,</hi> which in
this laſt Age having been enrich'd with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
new Diſcoveries, ought not to lie any
longer in Rubbiſh and Confuſion, but may
juſtly claim a Place in the <hi>Encyclopedia,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſuch as ſerves for a Model of Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for an able Politcian; that he propoſes to
himſelf no ſmall Stock of Fame in future Ages,
in being the firſt who has undertaken this
Deſign; and for the ſame Reaſon he hopes
the Imperfection of his Work will be excuſed.
He invites all Perſons who have any Talent
that way, or any new Diſcovery, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
their Thoughts, aſſuring them that
honorable mention ſhall be made of them in
his Work.</p>

               <div type="subsection">
                  <p>In the firſt Chapter of his excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
he reaſons Philoſophically concerning the
Nature of the Soul of Man, and thoſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
which render it ſuſceptible of Lyes. He
ſuppoſes the Soul to be of the Nature of a
<hi>Plano-Cylindrical Speculum,</hi> or Looking-glaſs;
that the plain ſide was made by God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but that the Devil afterwards wrought
the other ſide into a Cylindrical Figure. The
plain ſide repreſents Objects juſt as they are,
and the Cylindrical ſide, by the Rules of
Catoptricks, muſt needs repreſent true Objects
falſe, and falſe Objects true; but the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical
ſide being much the larger Surface,
takes in a greater Compaſs of viſual Rays.
That upon the Cylindrical ſide of the Soul
of Man depends the whole Art and Succeſs
of <hi>Political Lying.</hi> The Author, in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
proceeds to reaſon upon the other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of the Mind; As, great Fondneſs of the
<hi>Malicious</hi> and the <hi>Miraculous:</hi> The Tendency
of the Soul towards the <hi>Malicious,</hi> ſprings
from Self-love, or a Pleaſure to find Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
more wicked, baſe, or unfortunate, than
our ſelves. The Deſign of the <hi>Miraculous,</hi>
proceeds from the Inactivity of the Soul, or
its Incapacity to be moved or delighted with
any thing that is vulgar or common. The
Author having eſtabliſh'd the Qualities of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0540601800:6"/>
MIND, upon which his Art is founded, he
proceeds,</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p>In his Second Chapter, to Treat of the
Nature of <hi>Political Lying</hi>; which he defines,
to be, <hi>The Art of convincing the People of</hi> Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Falſhoods, <hi>for ſome good End.</hi> He calls it
an <hi>Art</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from that of telling
Truth, which does not ſeem to want <hi>Art</hi>;
but then he would have this underſtood on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as to the Invention, becauſe there is indeed
more Art neceſſary to convince the People
of a <hi>Salutary</hi> Truth, than a <hi>Salutary</hi> Falſhood.
Then he proceeds to prove, that there are
<hi>Salutary</hi> Falſhoods, of which he gives a great
many Inſtances both before and after the
Revolution; and demonſtrates plainly, that
we could not have carried, on the War ſo
long, without ſeveral of thoſe <hi>Salutary</hi> Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods.
He gives Rules to calculate the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of a <hi>Political Lye,</hi> in Pounds, Shillings,
and Pence. By <hi>Good,</hi> he does not mean that
which is abſolutely ſo, but what appears ſo
to the Artiſt, which is a ſufficient Ground
for him to proceed upon; and. he diſtinguiſhes
the Good, as it commonly, is, into <hi>Bonum
utile, dulce, &amp; honeſtum.</hi> He ſhews you, that
there are <hi>Political Lyes</hi> of a mix'd Nature,
which include all the <hi>Three</hi> in different reſpects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That the <hi>Utile</hi> reigns generally about the
<hi>Exchange,</hi> the <hi>Dulce</hi> and <hi>Honeſtum</hi> at the <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> End of the Town. One Man ſpreads
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0540601800:7"/>
a Lye to ſell or Buy Stock to greater Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
a ſecond, becauſe it is honorable to
ſerve his Party; and a third, becauſe it is
ſweet to gratify his Revenge. Having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
the ſeveral Terms of his Definition,
he proceeds,</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p>In his Third Chapter, to treat of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of <hi>Political Lying</hi>; which he deduces
from its true and genuine Principles, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
into the ſeveral Rights that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
have to Truth. He ſhews, that the
People have a Right to private Truth from
their Neighbours, and oeconomical Truth
from their own Family; that they ſhould
not be abuſed by their Wives, Children, and
Servants; but, that they have no Right at
all to <hi>Political</hi> Truth: That the People may
as well all pretend to be Lords of Mannors
and poſſeſs great Eſtates, as to have Truth
told them in Matters of Government. The
Author, with great Judgment, ſtates the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Shares of Mankind in this Matter of
Truth, according to their ſeveral Capacities,
Dignities, and Profeſſions; and ſhews you,
that Children have hardly any ſhare at all; in
conſequence of which, they have very ſeldom
any Truth told them. It muſt be own'd,
that the Author, in this Chapter, has ſome
ſeeming Difficulties to anſwer and explain
Texts of Scripture, and a Sermon lately
Preach'd before Her Majeſty at <hi>Windſor.</hi>

                  <p>The Fourth Chapter is wholly employed
in this Queſton, <hi>Whether the Right of Coinage
of Political Lyes be wholly in the Government?</hi>
The Author, who is a true Friend to <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Liberty, determines in the Negative, and
anſwers all the Arguments of the oppoſite
Party with great Acuteneſs; That as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>England</hi> has a Mixture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical
in it, ſo the Right of Inventing
and Spreading <hi>Political Lyes,</hi> is partly in the
People; and their obſtinate Adherence to this
juſt Privilege has been moſt conſpicuous, and
ſhin'd with great Luſtre of late Years: That
it happens very often, that there is no other
Means left to the good People of <hi>England</hi>
to pull down a Miniſtry and Government
they are weary of, but by exerciſing this
their undoubted Right: That abundance of
<hi>Political Lying</hi> is a ſure ſign of true <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Liberty: That as Miniſters do ſometimes
uſe Tools to ſupport their Power, it is but
reaſonable that the People ſhould employ the
ſame Weapon to defend themſelves, and pull
them down.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p>In his Fifth Chapter, he divides <hi>Political
Lyes</hi> into their ſeveral Species and Claſſes,
and gives Precepts about the Inventing,
Spreading, and Propagating the ſeveral ſorts
of them: He begins with the <hi>Rumores,</hi> and
<hi>Libelli famoſi,</hi> ſuch as concern the Reputation
of Men in Power; where he finds Fault
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0540601800:9"/>
with the common Miſtake, that takes No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
only of one ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> the Detractory
or Defamatory, whereas in truth there are
three ſorts, the Detractory, the Additory,
and the Tranſlatory. The Additory gives
to a Great Man a greater ſhare of Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than belongs to him, to enable him to
ſerve ſome good End or Purpoſe. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractory
or Defamatory, is a Lye which
takes from a Great Man the Reputation that
juſtly belongs to him, for fear he ſhould uſe
it to the Detriment of the Publick. The
Tranſlatory, is a Lye that transfers the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of a Man's good Action to another who
is in himſelf more deſerving; or, transfers
the Demerit of a bad Action from the true
Author, to a Perſon who is in himſelf leſs deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
He gives ſeveral Inſtances of very great
Strokes in all the Three Kinds, eſpecially in
the laſt, when it was neceſſary for the Good
of the Publick to beſtow the Valour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of one Man upon another, and that
of many to one Man; nay, even upon a
good Occaſion, a Man may be rob'd of his
Victory by a Perſon that did not Command
in the Action. The Reſtoring and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
the Publick may be aſcrib'd to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who had no hand in either. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
exhorts all Gentlemen Practitioners to
exerciſe themſelves in the Tranſlatory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Exiſtence of the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
being viſible, and not demanding any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0540601800:10"/>
Proof, there wants nothing to be put upon
the Publick but a falſe Author or a falſe
Cauſe, which is no great Preſumption upon
the Credulity of Mankind, to whom the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Springs of things are for the moſt part
unknown.</p>
                  <p>The Author proceeds to give ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
as to the Additory. That when one
aſcribes any thing to a Perſon which does not
belong to him, the Lye ought to be calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
not quite contradictory to his known
Qualities: <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> One would not make the
<hi>French</hi> King preſent at a Proteſtant Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle;
nor, like Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> reſtore the
Overplus of Taxes to her Subjects. One
would not bring in the <hi>Emperor</hi> giving two
Months Pay in Advance to his Troops; nor
the <hi>Dutch</hi> paying more, than their <hi>Quota.</hi>
One would not make the ſame Perſon zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for a Standing Army and Publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
nor an Atheiſt ſupport the Church;
nor a lewd Fellow a Reformer of Manners;
nor a hot-headed crack-brain'd Coxcomb for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for a Scheme of Moderation. But if
it is abſolutely neceſſary that a Perſon is to
have ſome good adventitious Quality given
him, the Author's Precept is, that it ſhould
not be done at firſt in <hi>extremo gradu.</hi> For
Example: They ſhould not make, a Covetous
Man give away all at once, Five thouſand
Pounds in a charitable generous way; Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Thirty Pounds may ſuffice at firſt,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0540601800:11"/>
They ſhould not introduce a Perſon of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Ingratitude to his Benefactors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding
a poor Man for ſome good Office
that was done him thirty Years ago; but
they may allow him to acknowledge a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to a Perſon who is capable ſtill to do
him another. A Man whoſe perſonal Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

                  <p>It will not be allow'd, to make a Great
Man, that is a known Deſpiſer of Religion,
ſpend whole Days in his Cloſet at his Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but, you may with Safety make him
ſit out publick Prayers with Decency. A
Great Man, who has never been known wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
to pay a juſt Debt, ought not all of
a ſudden to be introduc'd making Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Thouſands he has cheated; let it
ſuffice at firſt, to pay Twenty Pounds to a
Friend who has loſt his Note.</p>
                  <p>He lays down the ſame Rules in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractory
or Defamatory kind; that they
ſhould not be quite oppoſite to the Qualities
the Perſons are ſuppoſed to have. Thus it
will not be found, according to the found
Rules of <hi>Pſeudology,</hi> to report of a pious and
religious Prince, that he neglects his Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and would introduce Hereſy; but, you
may report of a merciful Prince, that he has
Pardon'd a Criminal who did not deſerve it.

You will be unſucceſsful if you give out of a
Great Man, who is remarkable for his Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
for the Publick, that he ſquanders away
the Nation's Money; but, you may ſafely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
that he hoards it: You muſt not affirm
he took a Bribe; but, you may freely cenſure
him for being tardy in his Payments; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
though neither may be true, yet the
laſt is credible, the firſt not. Of an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
generous Miniſter you are not to
ſay, that he was in an Intrigue to Betray
his Country; but, you may affirm with
ſome Probability, that he was in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue
with a Lady. He warns all Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
to take good heed to theſe Precepts,
for want of which, many of their Lies, of
late, have prov'd abortive on ſhort-liv'd.</p>

one of which is, that terrible Objects ſhould
not be too frequently ſhewn to the People,

neceſſary that the People of <hi>England</hi>
ſhould be frighted with the <hi>French</hi> King and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0540601800:13"/>
the <hi>Pretender</hi> once a Year; but, that the
Bears ſhould be chain'd up again till that

this ſo neceſſary a Precept, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the <hi>Raw-head and Bloody-bones</hi> upon
every trifling Occaſion, has produc'd great
Indifference in the Vulgar of late Years. As
to the Animating or Encouraging Lyes, he
gives the following Rules; That they ſhould
not far exceed the common degrees of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
and that there ſhould be variety
of them, and the ſame Lye not obſtinately

Lyes ſhould not be upon ſhort
Days, for fear the Authors ſhould have the
Shame and Confuſion to ſee themſelves ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
contradicted. He examines by theſe
Rules, that well-meant, but unfortunate Lye
of the Conqueſt of <hi>France,</hi> which continued
near twenty Years together; but at laſt, by
being too obſtinately inſiſted upon, it was
worn threadbare, and became unſucceſsful.</p>

                  <p>The Seventh Chapter is wholly taken up
in an Enquiry, Which of the two Parties are
the greateſt Artiſts in <hi>Political Lying.</hi> He
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0540601800:14"/>
owns the <hi>Tories</hi> have been better believed of
late; but, that the <hi>Whigs</hi> have much the
greater Genius's amongſt them. He attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
the late ill Succeſs of the <hi>Whig-Party</hi>
to their glutting the Market, and retailing
too much of a bad Commodity at once:
When there is too great a Quantity of
Worms, it is hard to catch Gudgeons. He
propoſes a Scheme for the Recovery of the
Credit of the <hi>Whig-Party,</hi> which indeed
ſeems to be ſomewhat Chimerical, and does
not ſavour of that ſound Judgment the
Author has ſhown in the reſt of the Work
It amounts to this, That the Party ſhould
agree to vent nothing but Truth for three
Months together, which will give them Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
for ſix Months Lying afterwards. He
owns, that he believes it almoſt impoſſible
to find fit Perſons to execute this Scheme.
Towards the end of the Chapter, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs
ſeverely againſt the Folly of Parties,
in retaining ſuch Scoundrels and Men of
Low Genius's to retail their Lyes; ſuch as
moſt of the preſent News-Writers are, who

in the Rules of <hi>Pſeudology,</hi> and not at all

                  <p>In his Eighth Chapter he treats of ſome

hopeful Young-men to turn their Invention
to the Service of their Country, it being
inglorious, at this time, to employ their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

Feats of Activity in Driving of Coaches,

                  <p>The Eighth Chapter is a Project for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the ſeveral ſmaller Corporations of Lyars
into one Society. It is too tedious to give
a full Account of the whole Scheme; what
is moſt remarkable is, That this Society ought
to conſiſt of the Heads of each Party; that
no Lye is to paſs current without their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,

preſent Exigencies, and what ſort of Lyes

<hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Probability,</hi> may be obſerv'd as

of the hopeful Genius's about the Town
(of which there are great plenty to be pick'd
up in the ſeveral Coffee-houſes) Travellers,
Virtuoſo's, Fox-hunters, Jockeys, Attorneys,

the ſole Management of <hi>Lying.</hi> That in their
outer Room there ought always to attend
ſome Perſons endow'd with a great Stock of
Credulity, a Generation that thrives mightily
in this Soil and Climate: He thinks a ſufficient
Number of them may be pick'd up any where
about the <hi>Exchange:</hi> Theſe are to Circulate
what the other Coin; for no Man ſpreads a
Lye with ſo good a Grace as he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
it. That the Rule of the Society be
to invent a Lye, and ſometimes two, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Day; in the Choice of which, great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
ought to be had to the Weather, and

Lyes,</hi> do mighty well in <hi>November</hi> and

unleſs the Eaſterly Winds reign. That it
ought to be Penal, for any body to talk of
any thing but the Lye of the Day. That
the Society is to maintain a ſufficient Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Spies at Court, and other Places, to
furniſh Hints and Topicks for Invention;
and a general Correſpondence in all the
Market-Towns, for Circulating their Lyes.
That if any one of die Society were obſerv'd
to bluſh, or look out of Countenance, or
want a neceſſary Circumſtance in telling
the Lye, he ought to be expell'd, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
incapable. Beſides the Roaring Lies,
there ought to be a private Committee for
Whiſpers, conſtituted of the ableſt Men of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0540601800:17"/>
the Society. Here the Author makes a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
in Praiſe of the <hi>Whig-Party,</hi> for the
right Underſtanding and Uſe of <hi>Proof-Lyes.</hi>
A <hi>Proof-Lye</hi> is like a Proof-Charge for a
Piece of Ordnance, to try a Standard-Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
Of ſuch a nature he takes Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
to be in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> a Proof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Article,
which if any one ſwallows, they are
ſure he will digeſt every thing elſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Whig-Party</hi> do wiſely, to try the
Credulity of the People ſometimes by <hi>Swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi>
that they may be able to judge to what
heighth they may Charge them afterwards.
Towards the End of this Chapter, he warns
the Heads of Parties againſt Believing their
own Lyes; which has prov'd of pernicious
Conſequence of late, both a Wiſe Party
and a Wiſe Nation having regulated their Affairs
upon Lyes of their own Invention. The
Cauſes of this he ſuppoſes to be too great a
Zeal and Intenſeneſs in the Practice of this
<hi>Art,</hi> and a vehement Heat in mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
whereby they perſwade one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that what they wiſh, and report to be
true, is really ſo. That all Parties have been
ſubject to this Misfortune: The <hi>Jacobites</hi>
have been conſtantly infeſted with it; but,
the <hi>Whigs</hi> of late ſeem ev'n to exceed them
in this ill Habit and Weakneſs. To this
Chapter, the Author ſubjoins a Calendar of
Lyes proper for the ſeveral Months of the
Year.</p>

                  <p>The Ninth Chapter treats of the Celerity
and Duration of Lyes. As to the Celerity
of their Motion, the Author ſays it is almoſt
incredible: He gives ſeveral Inſtances of Lyes
that have gone faſter than a Man can ride
Poſt: Your <hi>Terrifying Lyes</hi> travel at a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
rate, above ten Miles an hour; your
Whiſpers move in a narrow Vortex, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſwiftly. The Author ſays it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to explain ſeveral <hi>Phoenomena</hi> in relation
to the Celerity of Lyes, without the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of <hi>Synchroniſm</hi> and <hi>Combination.</hi> As to
the Duration of Lyes, he ſays they are of all
ſorts, from Hours and Days to Ages; that
there are ſome which, like your Inſects, die and
revive again in a different Form; that good
Artiſts, like People who build upon a ſhort
Leaſe, will calculate the Duration of a
Lye ſurely to anſwer their purpoſe; to laſt
juſt as long, and no longer, than the Turn
is ſerv'd.</p>

               <div type="subsection">
                  <p>The Tenth Chapter treats of the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteriſticks
of Lyes; how to know, when,
where, and by whom invented: Your <hi>Dutch,
Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Ware, are amply diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd
from one another; an <hi>Exchange-Lye</hi>
from one Coin'd at the other End of the
Town; Great Judgment is to be ſhewn
as to the Place where the Species is intended
to Circulate: Very low and baſe Coin will
ſerve for <hi>Wapping:</hi> There are ſeveral Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0540601800:19"/>
that have their particular Stamps, which
a judicious Practitioner may eaſily know.
All your Great Men have their proper <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuſticks.</hi>
The Author ſays he has attained,
by Study and Application, to ſo great Skill
in this Matter, that bring him any Lye, he
can tell whoſe Image it bears ſo truly, as
the Great Man himſelf ſhall not have the
face to deny it. The Promiſſory Lyes of
Great Men are known by Shouldering, Hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
Squeezing, Smiling, Bowing; and Lyes
in Matter of Fact, by immoderate Swearing.</p>

                  <p>He ſpends the whole Eleventh Chapter on
one ſimple Queſtion, <hi>Whether a Lye is best
contradicted by Truth, or another Lye.</hi> The
Author ſays, that conſidering the large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the Cylindrical Surface of the Soul,
and the great Propenſity to believe Lyes in
the generality of Mankind of late Years, he
thinks the propereſt Contradiction to a Lye,
is another Lye: For Example; If it ſhould be
reported that the Pretender was at <hi>London,</hi>
one would not contradict it by ſaying he
never was in <hi>England</hi>; but you muſt prove
by Eye-witneſſes that he came no farther
than <hi>Greenwich,</hi> but then went back again.
Thus if it be ſpread about that a great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
were dying of ſome Diſeaſe, you muſt
not ſay the Truth, that they are in Health,
and never had ſuch a Diſeaſe; but, that they
are ſlowly recovering of it. So there was,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0540601800:20"/>
not long ago, a Gentleman who affirmed,
That the Treaty with <hi>France</hi> for bringing in
Popery and Slavery into <hi>England,</hi> was Sign'd
the 15th of <hi>September</hi>; to which another an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
