            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Of the ſeveral authors who have written on Epic Poetry, many of the moſt celebrated are more likely to confound and depreſs, than to enlighten and exalt the young Poetical Student. The Poetics of Scaliger, which are little more than a laboured panegyric of Virgil, would lead him to regard the Aeneid as the only ſtandard of perfection; and the more elegant and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed Vida inculcates the ſame puſillanimous leſſon, though in ſpirited and harmonious verſe.</p>

                  <p>A Critic, who lately roſe to great eminence in our own country, has endeavoured by a more ſingular method to damp the ardour of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Genius, and to annihilate the hopes of all who would aſpire to the praiſe of originality in this higher ſpecies of poetical compoſition. He has attempted to eſtabliſh a Triumvirate in the Epic world, with a perpetuity of dominion. Every reader who is converſant with modern criticiſm will perceive that I allude to the following paſſage in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Diſſertation on the ſixth Book of Virgil:—"Juſt as Virgil ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valled Homer, ſo Milton emulated both of them. He found Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer poſſeſſed of the province of Morality; Virgil of Politics; and nothing left for him but that of Religion. This he ſeized, as aſpiring to ſhare with them in the government of the Poetic world: and, by means of the ſuperior dignity of his ſubject, hath gotten to the head of that Triumvirate, which took ſo many ages in forming. theſe are the three ſpecies of the Epic Poem; for its largeſt ſphere is <hi>human action,</hi> which can be conſidered but in a <hi>moral,</hi> political, or religious view: and theſe the three <hi>Makers</hi>; for each of their Poems was ſtruck out at a heat, and came to perfection from its firſt eſſay. Here then the grand ſcene was cloſed, and all farther improvements of the Epic at an end."</p>
                  <p>I apprehend that few critical remarks contain more <hi>abſurdity</hi> (to uſe the favourite expreſſion of the author I have quoted) than the preceding lines. Surely Milton is himſelf a proof that <hi>human action</hi> is not the largeſt ſphere of the Epic Poem; and as to Virgil, his moſt paſſionate admirers muſt allow, that in ſubject and deſign he is much leſs of an original than Camoens or Lucan. But ſuch a critical ſtatute of limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if I may call it ſo, is not leſs pernicious than abſurd. To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure the ſphere of Imagination with theſe capricious and arbitrary zones is an injury to ſcience. Such Criticiſm, inſtead of giving ſpirit
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0331500700:120"/>
and energy to the laudable ambition of a youthful Poet, can only lead him to ſtart like Macbeth at unreal mockery, and to exclaim, when he is invited by Genius to the banquet, "The Table's full."</p>

                  <p>I have ventured to ſuppoſe that Greece produced no worthy ſucceſſor of Homer, and that her exploits againſt the Perſians were not celebrated by any Poet in a manner ſuitable to ſo ſublime a ſubject;—yet an author named Chaerilus is ſaid to have recorded thoſe triumphs of his country in verſe, and to have pleaſed the Athenians ſo highly as to obtain from them a public and pecuniary reward. He is ſuppoſed to have been a cotemporary of the hiſtorian Herodotus. But from the general ſilence of the more early Greek writers concerning the merit of this Poet, we may, I think, very fairly conjecture that his compoſitions were not many degrees ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to thoſe of his unfortunate nameſake, who frequented the court of Alexander the Great, and is ſaid to have ſung the exploits of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, on the curious conditions of receiving a piece of gold for every good verſe, and a box on the ear for every bad one. The old Scholiaſt on Horace, who has preſerved this idle ſtory, concludes it by ſaying, that the miſerable Bard was beat to death in conſequence of his contract. Some eminent modern Critics have indeed attempted to vindicate the reputation of the more early Chaerilus, who is ſuppoſed to be confounded, both by Horace himſelf, and afterwards by Scaliger, with the Chaerilus rewarded by Alexander. Voſſius <note n="*" place="bottom">De Hiſtoricis Graecis.</note>, in particular, appears a warm advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in his behalf, and appeals to various fragments of the ancient Bard
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0331500700:121"/>
preſerved by Ariſtotle, Strabo, and others, and to the teſtimony of Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch in his favour. But on conſulting the fragments he has referred to, they rather fortify than remove my conjecture. The ſcrap preſerved by Ariſtotle in his Rhetoric is only half a verſe, and quoted without any commendation of its author. The two citations in Strabo amount to little more. The curious reader may alſo find in Athenaeus an Epitaph on Sardanapalus, attributed to this Poet; who is mentioned by the ſame author as peculiarly addicted to the groſſer exceſſes of the table.—Let us now return to that Chaerilus whom Horace has "damn'd to everlaſting fame." The judicious and elegant Roman Satiriſt ſeems remarkably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, in paying a compliment to the poetical judgment of his patron Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus, at the expence of the Macedonian hero. Alexander appears to have poſſeſſed much more poetical ſpirit, and a higher reliſh for poetry, than the cold-blooded Octavius. It is peculiarly unfair, to urge his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality to a poor Poet as a proof that he wanted critical diſcernment, when he had himſelf ſo thoroughly vindicated the delicacy of his taſte, by the enthuſiaſtic Bon-mot, that he had rather be the Therſites of Homer than the Achilles of Chaerilus.</p>

                     <l>The Grecian Bard's ideal picture draws.]</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Though Boſſu is called "the beſt explainer of Ariſtotle, and one of the moſt learned and judicious of modern critics," by a writer for whoſe opinions I have much eſteem, I cannot help thinking that his celebrated Eſſay on Epic Poetry is very ill calculated either to guide or to inſpirit a young Poet. The abſurdity of his advice concerning the mode of forming the fable, by chuſing a moral, inventing the incidents, and then ſearching hiſtory for names to ſuit them, has been ſufficiently expoſed: and as to his leading idea, concerning the deſign of Homer in the compoſition of the Iliad and Odyſſey, I apprehend moſt poetical readers muſt feel that he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably miſtaken; for it is a conjectural point, and placed beyond the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of deciſion. Perhaps few individuals differ more from each other in their modes of thinking, by the force of education and of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional manners, than a modern French Critic and an early Poet of Greece; yet the former will often pretend, with the moſt deciſive air,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0331500700:122"/>
to lay open the ſenſorium of an ancient Bard, and to count every link in the chain of his ideas. Thoſe who are moſt acquainted with the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of imagination, will acknowledge the ſteps of this airy power to be ſo light and evaneſcent in their nature, that perhaps a Poet himſelf, in a few years after finiſhing his work, might be utterly unable to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the exact train of thought, or the various minute occurrences which led him to the general deſign, or directed him in the particular parts of his poem. But, in ſpite of the interval of many hundred centuries, the deciſive magic of criticiſm can call up all the ſhadows of departed thought that ever exiſted in his brain, and diſplay, with a moſt aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing clearneſs, the preciſe ſtate of his mind in the moment of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                  <p>"Homere," ſays Boſſu, "<note n="*" place="bottom">Livre i. chap. 8.</note>voyoit les Grecs pour qui il écri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voit, diviſéz en autant d'etats qu'ils avoient de villes conſiderables: chacune faiſoit un corps à part &amp; avoit ſa forme de gouvernement inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendamment de toutes les autres. Et toute-fois ces etats differens etoient ſouvent obligéz de ſe reünir comme en un ſeul corps contre leurs enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis communs. Voila ſans doute deux ſortes de gouvernemens bien dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferens, pour etre commodement reunis en un corps de morale, &amp; en un ſeul poëme.</p>
                  <p>"Le poëte en a donc fait deux fables ſeparées. L'une eſt pour toute la Grece reünie en un ſeul corps, mais compoſée de parties independantes les unes des autres, comme elles etoient en effect; &amp; l'autre eſt pour chaque etat particulier, tels qu'ils etoient pendant la paix, ſans ce premier rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port &amp; ſans la neceſſeté de ſe reünir.</p>
                  <p>"Homere a donc pris pour le fond de ſa fable, cette grande verité, que la Meſintelligence des princes ruine leurs propres etats."</p>
                  <p>On the Odyſſey Boſſu remarks, "Que la verité qui ſert de fond à cette fiction, &amp; qui avec elle compoſe la fable, eſt, que l'abſence d'une perſonne hors de chez ſoi, ou qui n'a point l'oeil à ce qui s'y fait, y cauſe de grands deſordres <note n="†" place="bottom">Livre i. chap. 10.</note>."</p>
                  <p>On the mature conſideration of theſe two moral axioms, the Critic ſuppoſes the ſublime Bard to have begun his reſpective Poems; for Homer, continues he, "<note n="‡" place="bottom">Livre i. chap. 13.</note> n'avoit point d'autre deſſein que de former
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0331500700:123"/>
agreablement les moeurs de ſes Citoïens, en leur propoſant, comme dit Horace, ce qui eſt utile ou pernicieux, ce qui eſt honnete ou ce qui ne l'eſt pas: — il n'a entrepris de raconter aucune action particuliere d'Achille ou d'Ulyſſe. Il a fait la fable et le deſſein de ſes poemes, ſans penſer à ces princes; &amp; enſuite il leur a fait l'honneur de donner leurs noms aux heros qu'il avoit feints."</p>
                  <p>The preceding remarks of this celebrated Critic have been frequently admired as an ingenious conjecture, which moſt happily illuſtrates the real purpoſe of Homer. To me they appear ſo much the reverſe, that if I ventured to adopt any decided opinion on a point ſo much darkened by the clouds of antiquity, I ſhould rather incline to the idea which Boſſu affects to explode, and ſuppoſe the Poems of Homer intended panegyrics on the very princes whom the Critic affirms he never thought of while he was deſigning the works which have made them immortal.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſtriking paſſage on this ſubject in a dialogue of Plato, which I ſhall enlarge upon, for two reaſons: 1ſt, As it proves that the latter perſuaſion concerning the purpoſe of Homer was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at Athens; and 2dly, Becauſe it gives me a pleaſing oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſupporting the learned Madame Dacier againſt an ill-grounded cenſure of a late Engliſh critic. In her Preface to the Odyſſey, ſhe aſſerts that the judgment of antiquity decided in favor of the Iliad; and ſhe appeals to part of the ſentence in Plato to which I have alluded, as a proof of her aſſertion. Mr. Wood, in a note to the Introduction of his Eſſay on Homer, endeavours to ſhew the inſufficiency of this proof; and ſtill farther, to convince us that Madame Dacier was utterly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in her ſenſe of the paſſage to which ſhe appealed. If he ventures to contradict this learned lady, he does not however inſult her with that inſolent pertneſs with which ſhe is frequently treated in the notes to Pope's Homer; and which, for the honour of our Engliſh Poet, I will not ſuppoſe to be his. But though Mr. Wood endeavours to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his opinion by argument, I apprehend that he is himſelf miſtaken, and that Madame Dacier is perfectly right in underſtanding the words of Socrates in their literal ſenſe, without the leaſt mixture of irony. It is true, indeed, that the aim of Socrates, in the courſe of the dialogue, is to ridicule the preſumption and ignorance of the ſophiſt Hippias, in the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0331500700:124"/>
moſt ironical manner; but the particular ſpeech on Which Madame Dacier founds her opinion, is a plain and ſimple addreſs to Eudicus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he enters on his debate with the Sophiſt. It turns on the moſt ſimple circumſtance, the truth of which Eudicus could hardly be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, namely, the ſentiments of his own father concerning the Poems of Homer. As theſe ſentiments are ſuch as I believe moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of the ancient Bard have entertained on the point in queſtion, I perfectly agree with Madame Dacier in thinking that Socrates means to be literal and ſerious, when he ſays to Eudicus, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Plat. Hip. min. edit. Serrani, tom. i. pag. 363. " I have heard your father Apemantus ſay, that the Iliad of Homer was a finer poem than his Odyſſey, and as far ſurpaſſed it in excellence as the virtue of Achilles ſurpaſſed the virtue of Ulyſſes; for thoſe two poems, he ſaid, were purpoſely compoſed in honour of thoſe two heroes: the Odyſſey, to ſhew the virtues of Ulyſſes; the Iliad, thoſe of Achilles." Plato's Leſſer Hippias, tranſlated by Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, page 13.</p>
                  <p>Let us now return to Boſſu; whoſe opinion concerning the purpoſe of Homer we may venture to oppoſe, ſupported as it is by an ingenious interpretation of ſome ambiguous paſſages in the Poetics of Ariſtotle; and this oppoſition may be grounded, not ſo much on the ſentence which I have quoted from Plato, as on the probable conduct of Epic compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the early ages of poetry. In ſuch periods as produced the talents of Virgil and of Dryden, when all the arts of refined flattery were perfectly underſtood, we can eaſily conceive that they might both be tempted to compliment the reigning monarch under the maſk of ſuch heroic names as hiſtory could ſupply, and their genius accommodate to their purpoſe. We find accordingly, that the Roman Bard is ſuppoſed to have drawn a flattering portrait of his Emperor in the character of Aeneas, and that the Engliſh Poet has, with equal ingenuity, enwrapt the diſſolute Charles the Second in the Jewiſh robes of King David. But in ſo rude an age as we muſt admit that of Homer to have been; when the Poet was certainly more the child of Nature than of Art; when he had no hiſtory to conſult, perhaps no patron to flatter, and no critics
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0331500700:125"/>
to elude or obey; in ſuch an age, may we not more naturally conjecture, that poetical compoſition was neither laboured in its form, nor deep in its deſign? that, inſtead of being the ſlow and ſyſtematic product of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical reaſoning, it was the quick and artleſs offspring of a ſtrong and vivifying fancy, which, brooding over the tales of tradition, ſoon raiſed them into ſuch life and beauty, as muſt ſatisfy and enchant a warlike and popular audience, ever ready to liſten with delight to the heroic feats of their anceſtors.</p>
                  <p>If the learned Boſſu appears unfortunate in his ſyſtem concerning the purpoſe of Homer, he may be thought ſtill more ſo in his attempt to analyze the Divinities of Virgil; for, to throw new light on the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gods, in the opening of the tenth Aeneid, he very ſeriouſly informs us, that "<note n="*" place="bottom">Book v. chap. I.</note>Venus is divine mercy, or the love of God towards virtuous men; and Juno his juſtice."</p>
                  <p>I cannot conclude theſe very free ſtrictures on a celebrated author, without bearing a pleaſing teſtimony to the virtues of the man.—Boſſu is allowed by the biographers of his country to have been remarkable for the mildeſt manners and moſt amiable diſpoſition; totally free from that imperious and bigotted attachment to ſpeculative opinions, which the ſcience he cultivated is ſo apt to produce. He endeared himſelf to Boileau by a generous act of friendſhip, that led to an intimacy between them, which was diſſolved only by the death of the former, in 1680.</p>

                  <p>As it requires much leiſure to examine, and more ſkill to unravel an intricate hypotheſis, twiſted into a long and laboured chain of quotation and argument, the Diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the ſixth Book of Virgil remained for ſome time unrefuted. The public very quietly acquieſced in the ſtrange poſition of its author, "That Aeneas's adventure to the infernal ſhades, is no other than a figurative deſcription of his initiation into the Myſteries; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly a very exact one of the ſpectacles of the Eleuſinian." At length a ſuperior but anonymous Critic aroſe, who, in one of the moſt judicious
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0331500700:126"/>
and ſpirited eſſays that our nation has produced on a point of claſſical literature, completely overturned this ill-founded edifice, and expoſed the arrogance and futility of its aſſuming architect. The Eſſay I allude to is entitled "Critical Obſervations on the Sixth Book of the Aeneid;" printed for Elmſly, 1770: and as this little publication is, I believe, no longer to be purchaſed, the curious reader may thank me for tranſcribing a few of its moſt ſtriking paſſages.</p>
                  <p>Having ridiculed, with great ſpirit and propriety, Warburton's gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral idea of the Aeneid as a political inſtitute, and his ill-ſupported aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that both the ancient and modern poets afforded Virgil a pattern for introducing the Myſteries into this famous epiſode, the author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to examine how far the Critic's hypotheſis of initiation may be ſupported or overthrown by the text of the Poet. "It is," ſays he, "from extrinſical circumſtances that we may expect the diſcovery of Virgil's allegory. Every one of theſe circumſtances perſuades me, that Virgil deſcribed a real, not a mimic world, and that the ſcene lay in the Infernal Shades, and not in the Temple of Ceres.</p>

the reſearches, or wanted the applauſe, of a learned and judicious fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner. Profeſſor Heyne, the late accurate and accompliſhed Editor of Virgil, has mentioned it, in his Comments to the ſixth Book of the Aeneid, with the honour it deſerves. He remarks, indeed, that the Author has cenſured the learned Prelate with ſome little acrimony; "Paullo acrius quam velis." But what lover of poetry, unbiaſſed by perſonal connection, can ſpeak of Warburton without ſome marks of indignation? If I have alſo alluded to this famous Commentator with a contemptuous aſperity, it ariſes from the perſuaſion that he has ſullied the page of every Poet whom he pretended to illuſtrate; and that he frequently degraded the uſeful and generous profeſſion of Criticiſm into a mean inſtrument of perſonal malignity: or (to uſe the more forcible language of his greateſt antagoniſt) that he "inveſted himſelf in the high office of Inquiſitor General and Supreme Judge of the Opinions of the Learned; which he aſſumed and exerciſed with a ferocity and deſpotiſm without example in the Republic of Letters, and hardly to be paralleled among the diſciples of Dominic <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter to Warburton by a late Profeſſor, &amp;c. page 9. 2d edition.</note>." It is the juſt lot of tyrants to be deteſted; and of all uſurpers, the literary deſpot is the leaſt excuſable, as he has not the common tyrannical plea of neceſſity or intereſt to alledge in his behalf; for the prevalence of <hi>his edicts</hi> will be found to ſink in proportion to the arbitrary tone with which they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. The fate of Warburton is a ſtriking inſtance of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant truth. What havock has the courſe of very few years produced in that pile of imperious criticiſm which he had heaped together! Many of his notes on Shakeſpeare have already reſigned their place to the ſuperior comments of more accompliſhed Critics; and perhaps the day is not far diſtant, when the volumes of Pope himſelf will ceaſe to be a repoſitory for the lumber of his friend. The ſevereſt enemies of Warburton muſt indeed allow, that ſeveral of his remarks on his Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Patron are entitled to preſervation, by their uſe or beauty; but the greater part, I apprehend, are equally deſtitute of both: and how far the Critic was capable of diſgracing the Poet, muſt be evident to every reader who recollects that the nonſenſe in the Eſſay on Criticiſm, where

                  <p>Though arrogance is perhaps the moſt ſtriking and characteriſtical defect in the compoſition of this aſſuming Commentator, he had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly other critical failings of conſiderable importance; and it may poſſibly be rendering ſome little ſervice to the art which he profeſſed, to inveſtigate the peculiarities in this ſingular writer, which conſpire to plunge him in the crowd of thoſe <hi>evaneſcent critics</hi> (if I may uſe ſuch an expreſſion) whom his friend Pope beheld in ſo clear a viſion, that he ſeems to have given us a prophetical portrait of his own Commentator.

I ſhall therefore hazard a few farther obſervations, not only on this famous Critic of our age and country, but on the two greater names of antiquity, to each of whom he has been declared ſuperior by the partial voice of enthuſiaſtic friendſhip. I wiſh not to offend his moſt zealous adherents; and, though I cannot but conſider him as a literary uſurper, I ſpeak of him as a great Hiſtorian ſaid of more exalted tyrants, ſine ira et ſtudio, quorum cauſas procul habeo.—There ſeem to be three natural endowments requiſite in the formation of an accompliſhed critic;—ſtrong underſtanding, lively imagination, and refined ſenſibility. The firſt was the characteriſtic of Ariſtotle, and by the conſent of all ages he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to have poſſeſſed it in a ſuperlative degree. May I be pardoned for the opinion, that he enjoyed but a very moderate portion of the <hi>other two?</hi> I would not abſolutely ſay that he had neither Fancy nor Feeling; but that his imagination was <hi>not brilliant,</hi> and that his ſenſibility was not exquiſite, may I think be fairly preſumed from the general tenor of his proſe; nor does the little relique of his poetry contradict the idea. The two qualities in which Ariſtotle may be ſuppoſed defective, were the very two which peculiarly diſtinguiſh Longinus; who certainly wanted not underſtanding, though he might not poſſeſs the philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0331500700:132"/>
ſagacity of the Stagyrite. When conſidered in every point of view, he appears the moſt conſummate character among the Critics of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. If Warburton wore any reſemblance to either of theſe mighty names, I apprehend it muſt be to the former, and perhaps in imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was ſuperior to Ariſtotle; but, of the three qualities which I have ventured to conſider as requiſite in the perfect Critic, I conceive him to have been miſerably deficient in the laſt, and certainly the moſt eſſential of the three; for, as the great Commentator of Horace has phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophically and truly remarked, in a note to that Poet, "Feeling, or Sentiment, is not only the ſureſt, but the ſole ultimate arbiter of works of genius <note n="*" place="bottom">Notes on the Epiſtle to Auguſtus, ver. 210.</note>." A man may poſſeſs an acute underſtanding and a lively imagination, without being a ſound Critic; and this truth perhaps can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more clearly ſhewn than in the writings of Warburton. His underſtanding was undoubtedly acute, his imagination was lively; but Imagination and Sentiment are by no means ſynonymous; and he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly wanted thoſe finer feelings which conſtitute accuracy of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a perfect perception of literary excellence. In conſequence of this defect, inſtead of ſeizing the real ſenſe and intended beauties of an author, he frequently followed the caprices of his own active fancy, which led him in queſt of ſecret meanings and myſterious alluſions; theſe he readily found, and his powers of underſtanding enabled him to dreſs them up in a plauſible and ſpecious form, and to perſuade many readers that he was (what he believed himſelf to be) the reſtorer of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Criticiſm. As a farther proof that he was deſtitute of refined ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, I might alledge the peculiarity of his diction, which, as Dr. Johnſon has very juſtly remarked, is coarſe and impure. Perhaps it may be found, that in proportion as authors have enjoyed the quality which I ſuppoſe him to have wanted, they have been more or leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by the eaſe, the elegance, and the beauty of their language: were I required to fortify this conjecture by examples, I ſhould produce the names of Virgil and Racine, of Fenelon and Addiſon—that Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who, though inſulted by the Commentator of Pope with the names of an indifferent Poet and a worſe Critic, was, I think, as much ſuperior to his inſulter in critical taſte, and in ſolidity of judgment, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly

was in the harmony of his ſtyle, and in all the finer graces of beautiful compoſition.</p>

                  <p>Theſe, and the ſix ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent lines, allude to the following paſſage in Dr. Warton's Eſſay on Pope. "I conclude theſe reflections with a remarkable fact. In no poliſhed nation, after Criticiſm has been much ſtudied, and the rules of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtabliſhed, has any very extraordinary work ever appeared. This has viſibly been the caſe in Greece, in Rome, and in France, after Ariſtotle, Horace, and Boileau had written their Arts of Poetry. In our own country, the rules of the Drama, for inſtance, were never more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely underſtood than at preſent; yet what unintereſting, though faultleſs, Tragedies have we lately ſeen? ſo much better is our judgment than our execution. How to account for the fact here mentioned, ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately and juſtly, would be attended with all thoſe difficulties that await diſcuſſions relative to the productions of the human mind, and to the delicate and ſecret cauſes that influence them; whether or no the natural powers be not confined and debilitated by that timidity and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is occaſioned by a rigid regard to the dictates of art; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that philoſophical, that geometrical, and ſyſtematical ſpirit ſo much in vogue, which has ſpread itſelf from the ſciences even into polite lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, by conſulting only <hi>reaſon,</hi> has not diminiſhed and deſtroyed <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent,</hi> and made our poets write from and to the <hi>head,</hi> rather than the heart; or whether, laſtly, when juſt models, from which the rules have neceſſarily been drawn, have once appeared, ſucceeding writers, by vainly and ambitiouſly ſtriving to ſurpaſs thoſe juſt models, and to ſhine and ſurpriſe, do not become ſtiff and forced, and affected in their thoughts and diction." Warton's Eſſay, page 209, 3d edition.—I admire this ingenious and modeſt reaſoning; but, for the honour of that ſeverer art, which this pleaſing writer has the happy talent to enliven and embelliſh, I will venture to ſtart ſome doubts concerning the fact itſelf for which he endeavours to account. Perhaps our acquaintance with thoſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Greece and Rome, which were ſubſequent to Ariſtotle and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, is not ſufficiently perfect to decide the point either way in reſpect
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0331500700:134"/>
to thoſe countries. But with regard to France, may we not aſſert, that her poetical productions, which aroſe after the publication of Boileau's Didactic Eſſay, are at leaſt equal, if not ſuperior, to thoſe which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded that period? If the Henriade of Voltaire is not a fine Epic poem, it is allowed to be the beſt which the French have to boaſt; not to mention the dramatic works of that extraordinary and univerſal author. If this remarkable fact may indeed be found true, I ſhould rather ſuppoſe it to ariſe from the irritable nature of the poetic ſpirit, ſo peculiarly averſe to reſtraint and controul. The Bard who could gallop his Pegaſus over a free and open plain, might be eager to engage in ſo pleaſing an exerciſe; but he who obſerved the direction-poſts ſo thickly and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſely planted, that, inſtead of aſſiſting his career, they muſt probably occaſion his fall, would eaſily be tempted to deſcend from his ſteed, and to decline the courſe. Let me illuſtrate this conjecture by a ſtriking fact, in the very words of the Poet juſt mentioned, who was by no means deficient in poetical confidence, and who has left us the following anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote of himſelf, in that pleaſing little anonymous work entitled, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaire Hiſtorique ſur les Oeuvres de l' Auteur de la Henriade. "Il lut un jour pluſieurs chants de ce poeme chez le jeune Préſident de Maiſons, ſon intime ami. On l'impatienta par des objections; il jetta ſon manuſcrit dans le feu. Le Préſident Hénaut l'en retira avec peine. "Souvenez vous (lui dit Mr. Hénaut) dans une de ſes lettres, que c'eſt moi qui ai ſauvé la Henriade, et qu'il m'en a couté une belle paire de manchettes."</p>
                  <p>To return to the Eſſay on Pope.—I rejoice that the amiable Critic has at length obliged the public with the concluſion of his moſt engaging and ingenious work: he has the ſingular talent to inſtruct and to pleaſe even thoſe readers who are moſt ready to revolt from the opinion which he endeavours to eſtabliſh; and he has in ſome degree atoned for that exceſs of ſeverity which his firſt volume diſcovered, and which ſunk the reputation of Pope in the eyes of many, who judge not for themſelves, even far below that mortifying level to which he meant to reduce it. Had Pope been alive, to add this ſpirited eſſay to the bundle of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt himſelf which he is ſaid to have collected, he muſt have felt, that, like the dagger of Brutus, it gave the moſt painful blow, from the character of the aſſailant:

There is nothing in Boileau's admirable Didactic Eſſay ſo liable to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection as the whole paſſage concerning Epic poetry. His patronage of the old Pagan divinities, and his oblique recommendation of Claſſical heroes, are alike exceptionable. Even a higher name than Boileau has failed in framing precepts for the Epic Muſe. The maxims delivered by Taſſo himſelf, in his Diſcourſe on Epic poetry, are ſo far from perfect, that an agreeable and judicious French critic has very juſtly ſaid of him, "S'il eût mis ſa theorie en pratique, ſon poeme n'auroit pas tant de charmes <note n="*" place="bottom">Marmontel Poetique Françoiſe.</note>." I am not ſo vain as to think of ſucceeding in the point where theſe immortal authors have failed; and I muſt beg my reader to remember, that the preſent work is by no means intended as a code of laws for the Epic poet; it is not my deſign
<q>To write receipts how poems may be made.</q>
For I think the writer who would condeſcend to frame this higher ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of compoſition according to the exact letter of any directions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, may be moſt properly referred to that admirable receipt for an Epic poem with which Martinus Scriblerus will happily ſupply him. My ſerious deſire is to examine and refute the prejudices which have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, as I apprehend, the neglect of the Heroic Muſe: I wiſh to kindle in our Poets a warmer ſenſe of national honour, with ambition to excel in the nobleſt province of poeſy. If my eſſay ſhould excite that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enthuſiaſm in the breaſt of any young poetic genius, ſo far from wiſhing to confine him by any arbitrary dictates of my own imagination, I ſhould rather ſay to him, in the words of Dante's Virgil,

Erycius, the author of the inſcription, is ſuppoſed to have lived in the ſame age. Among the modern adverſaries of Homer, the French are moſt remarkable for their ſeverity and injuſtice: nor is it ſurpriſing, that the nation which has diſplayed the fainteſt ſparks of Epic fire, ſhould be the moſt ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to reduce the oppreſſive ſplendor of this exalted luminary. The moſt depreciating remarks on genius, in every walk, are generally made by thoſe who are the leaſt able to prove its rivals; and often, perhaps, not ſo much from the prevalence of envious malignity, as from the want of vivid and delicate perception. The merits and the failings of Homer were agitated in France with all the heat and acrimony of a theological diſpute. Madame Dacier diſtinguiſhed herſelf in the conteſt by her uncommon talents and erudition: ſhe combated for the Grecian Bard with the ſpirit of Minerva defending the Father of the Gods. It muſt however be confeſt, that ſhe ſometimes overſtepped the modeſty of wiſdom, and caught, unwarily, the ſcolding tone of Juno. It is indeed amuſing, to obſerve a people, who pique themſelves on their extreme po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, and cenſure Homer for the groſs behaviour of his Gods, engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among themſelves in a ſquabble concerning this very Poet, with all the unrefined animoſity of his Olympian Synod. In the whole contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy there is nothing more worthy of remembrance and of praiſe, than the lively elegance and the pleaſing good-humour of Mr. de la Motte, who, though not one of the moſt exalted, was certainly one of the moſt amiable, characters in the literary world; and made a generous return to the ſeverity of his female antagoniſt, by writing an ode in her praiſe.

Voltaire has pointed out, with his uſual ſpirit, the failings of La Motte in his Abridgement of the Iliad; but he has frequently fallen himſelf into ſimilar defects, and is equally unjuſt to Homer, againſt whom he has levelled the moſt bitter ſarcaſms, both in proſe and verſe. Voltaire at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking Homer, is like Paris ſhooting his arrow at the heel of Achilles: the two Poets are as unequal as the two ancient Warriors; yet Homer, like Achilles, may have his vulnerable ſpot; but with this happy dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that although the ſhaft of ridicule, which is pointed againſt him, may be tinged with venom, its wound cannot be mortal. Perhaps no better anſwer can be made to all thoſe who amuſe themſelves with writing againſt Homer, than the following reply of Madame Dacier to the Abbé Terraſſon, who had attacked her favourite Bard in two abuſive volumes:—"Que Monſieur l'Abbé Terraſſon trouve Homere ſot, ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule, extravagant, ennuyeux, c'eſt ſon affaire, le public jugera ſi c'eſt un defaut à Homere de deplaire à M. l'Abbé Terraſſon, ou à M. l'Abbé Terraſſon de ne pas gouter Homere."</p>

Finding it ill received by his countrymen, he retired to Rhodes, where he is conjectured to have poliſhed and completed his Work, ſupporting himſelf by the profeſſion of Rhetoric, and receiving from the Rhodians the freedom of their city. He at length returned, with conſiderable honour, to the place of his birth, ſucceeding Eratoſthenes in the care of the Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian Library, in the reign of Ptolemy Euergetes, who aſcended the throne of Egypt in the year before Chriſt 246. That prince had been
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0331500700:142"/>
educated by the famous Ariſtarchus, and rivalled the preceding ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns of his liberal family in the munificent encouragement of learning. Apollonius was a diſciple of the poet Callimachus; but their connection ended in the moſt violent enmity, which was probably owing to ſome degree of contempt expreſſed by Apollonius for the light compoſitions of his maſter. The learned have vainly endeavoured to diſcover the particulars of their quarrel.— The only Work of Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius which has deſcended to modern times, is his Poem, in four Books, on the Argonautic expedition. Both Longinus and Quintilian have aſſigned to this Work the mortifying character of Mediocrity; but there lies an appeal from the ſentence of the moſt candid and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened Critics to the voice of Nature; and the merit of Apollonius has little to apprehend from the deciſion of this ultimate judge. His Poem abounds in animated deſcription, and in paſſages of the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and pathetic beauty. How finely painted is the firſt ſetting forth of the Argo! and how beautifully is the wife of Chiron introduced, holding up the little Achilles in her arms, and ſhewing him to his father Peleus as he ſailed along the ſhore! But the chief excellence in our Poet, is the ſpirit and delicacy with which he has delineated the paſſion of love in his Medea. That Virgil thought very highly of his merit in this particular is ſufficiently evident from the minute exactneſs with which he has copied many tender touches of the Grecian Poet. Thoſe who compare the third Book of Apollonius with the fourth of Virgil, may, I think, perceive not only that Dido has ſome features of Medea, but that the two Bards, however different in their reputation, reſembled each other in their genius; and that they both excel in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and pathos.</p>

                  <p>Scaliger appears to be the moſt extravagant of all the Critics who have laviſhed their undiſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encomiums on Virgil, by aſſerting that he alone is entitled to the name of Poet. Poetices, lib. iii. c. 2. — Though the opinion of Spence, and other modern Critics, concerning the character of Aeneas, conſidered as an allegorical portrait of Auguſtus, ſeems to gain ground, yet it might perhaps be eaſy to overturn the ingenious conjectures
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0331500700:143"/>
and the fanciful reaſoning by which that idea has been ſupported. This attempt would have the ſanction of one of the moſt judicious Commentators of Virgil; for the learned Heyne expreſsly rejects all allegorical interpretation, and thinks it improbable that a Poet of ſo correct a judgment could have adopted a plan which muſt neceſſarily contract and cramp his powers. He even ventures to aſſert, that if the character of Aeneas was delineated as an allegorical portrait of Auguſtus, the execution of it is unhappy. The ſtrongeſt argument which has been adduced to ſupport this conjecture, is founded on the ingenious interpretation of the following paſſage in the opening of the third Georgic:
<q>
                        <l>Primus ego in patriam mecum, modo vita ſuperſit,</l>

                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Hurd's Horace, vol.ii. page 44.</note>; and the great Critic who firſt ſtarted the idea, has expatiated, in the triumph of his diſcovery, on the <hi>myſterious</hi> beauties they contain: but the whole of this hypotheſis is unfortunately built upon the rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of three verſes, which are pronounced unworthy of the Poet, and which, though found in every MS. the Critic claims a right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving. A licence ſo extraordinary cannot even be juſtified by the talents of this accompliſhed writer; for if the leſs elegant paſſages of the ancient Poets might be removed at pleaſure, their compoſitions would be expoſed to the caprice of every fantaſtic commentator. The obvious and literal interpretation not only renders this violence unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but is more agreeable to the judgment of the Poet and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

of his age. The cuſtom of erecting real temples was ſo familiar to antiquity, that a Roman would never have ſuſpected the edifice was to be raiſed only with poetical materials. We may even conjecture, from a line of Statius, that the Poet himſelf had a temple erected to his memory; and, without any breach of probability, we may admit his intention of giving his living Emperor ſuch a teſtimony of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. This adulation, though ſhocking to us, was too generally juſtified by example to oblige the Poet to palliate it by a fiction. He had before acquieſced in the divinity of his Imperial Patron, and had expreſſed the idea in its full ſenſe.</p>

The unfortunate rejected lines, for whoſe elegance we do not contend, may at leaſt be reſcued from impropriety by a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral interpretation of the preceding paſſage; for, diſmiſs the conjectured allegory, and the chief objections againſt them remain no longer. If the phraſeology be peculiar, it is at leaſt ſupported by concurring MSS. The adjective <hi>ardens</hi> is ſometimes undoubtedly joined to a word that does not denote a ſubſtance of heat or flame, as the Critic himſelf ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits in the caſe of <hi>ardentes hoſtes,</hi> to which we may add the <hi>verbum ardens</hi> of Cicero. As to the line which is ſaid to contain the moſt glaring note of illegitimacy,

The Poet expreſſes his intention of erecting a temple to Auguſtus, and expatiates on the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence with which it was to be adorned: he then returns to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poetical ſubject;

Perhaps the important poſition that gave riſe to this conjecture, and to others of a ſimilar complexion, "that the propriety of allegorical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition made the diſtinguiſhed pride of ancient poetry," is as queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as the conjecture itſelf; and a diligent and judicious peruſal of the ancient Poets might convince us, that ſimplicity was their genuine character, and that many of their allegorical beauties have originated in the fertile imagination of their commentators. Ariſtarchus, indeed, the celebrated model of ancient criticiſm, rejected with great ſpirit the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical interpretations of Homer, as we are informed by Euſthathius; but the good Archbiſhop of Theſſalonica, who, like ſome modern pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, had a paſſion for allegory, cenſures the great Critic of Alexandria for his more ſimple mode of conſtruction, and ſuppoſes it an injury to the refined beauties and profound wiſdom of the Poet. <q>

                  <p>There is hardly any emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſonage of antiquity who has ſuffered more from detraction, both
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0331500700:146"/>
in his literary and moral character, than the poet Lucan. His fate, indeed, ſeems in all points to have been peculiarly ſevere. His early death, at an age when few Poets have even laid the foundation of their capital work, is itſelf ſufficient to excite our compaſſion and regret; but to periſh by the envious tyranny of Nero, may be conſidered as a bleſſing, when compared with the more cruel misfortune of being branded with infamy in the immortal pages of Tacitus. As I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that the great Hiſtorian has inadvertently adopted the groſſeſt calumny againſt our Poet, I ſhall moſt readily aſſign my reaſons for thinking ſo. It may firſt be proper to give a ſhort ſketch of Lucan's life.—He was the ſon of Anneus Mela, the youngeſt brother of Seneca; and though born at Corduba, was conveyed to Rome at the age of eight months: a circumſtance, as his more indulgent critics obſerve, which ſufficiently refutes the cenſure of thoſe who conſider his language as provincial. At Rome he was educated under the Stoic Cornutus, ſo warmly celebrated by his diſciple Perſius the Satiriſt, who was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate friend of our Poet. In the cloſe of his education Lucan is ſaid to have paſſed ſome time at Athens. On his return to Rome he roſe to the office of Quaeſtor, before he had attained the legal age. He was afterwards inrolled among the Augurs; and married a lady of noble birth, of whoſe amiable character I ſhall ſpeak more at large in a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent note. Lucan had for ſome time been admitted to familiarity with Nero, when the Emperor choſe to contend for poetical honours by the public recital of a poem he had compoſed on Niobe; and ſome verſes of this imperial production are ſuppoſed to be preſerved in the firſt Satire of Perſius. Lucan had the hardineſs to repeat a poem on Orpheus, in competition with that of Nero; and, what is more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the judges of the conteſt were juſt and bold enough to decide againſt the Emperor. From hence Nero became the perſecutor of his ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful rival, and forbade him to produce any poetry in public. The well-known conſpiracy of Piſo againſt the tyrant ſoon followed; and Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, with his uſual ſarcaſtic ſeverity, concludes that Lucan engaged in the enterprize from the poetical injuries he had received: a remark which does little credit to the candour of the Hiſtorian; who might have found a much nobler, and, I will add, a more probable motive for his conduct, in the generous ardor of his character, and his paſſionate adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0331500700:147"/>
of freedom. In the ſequel of his narration, Tacitus alledges a charge againſt our Poet, which, if it were true, muſt lead us to deteſt him as the moſt abject of mankind. The Hiſtorian aſſerts, that Lucan, when accuſed of the conſpiracy, for ſome time denied the charge; but; corrupted at laſt by a promiſe of impunity, and deſirous to atone for the tardineſs of his confeſſion, accuſed his mother Atilla as his accomplice. This circumſtance is ſo improbable in itſelf, and ſo little conſonant to the general character of Lucan, that ſome writers have treated it with contempt, as a calumny invented by Nero to vilify the object of his envious abhorrence. But the name of Tacitus has given ſuch an air of authority to the ſtory, that it may ſeem to deſerve a more ſerious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, particularly as there are two ſubſequent events related by the ſame Hiſtorian, which have a tendency to invalidate the accuſation ſo injurious to our Poet. The events I mean are, the fate of Annaeus, and the eſcape of Atilla, the two parents of Lucan. The former died in conſequence of art accuſation brought againſt him, after the death of his ſon, by Fabius Romanus, who had been intimate with Lucan and forged ſome letters in his name, with the deſign of proving his father concerned in the conſpiracy. Theſe letters were produced to Nero, who ſent them to Annaeus, from an eager deſire, ſays Tacitus, to get poſſeſſion of his wealth. From this fact two inferences may be drawn, according to the different lights in which it may be conſidered:—If the accuſation againſt Annaeus was juſt, it is clear that Lucan had not betrayed his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he appears the leſs likely to have endangered by his confeſſion the life of a parent, to whom he owed a ſtill tenderer regard:—If Annaeus was not involved in the conſpiracy, and merely put to death by Nero for the ſake of his treaſure, we may the more readily believe, that the tyrant who murdered the father from avarice, might calumniate the ſon from envy. But the eſcape of Atilla affords us the ſtrongeſt reaſon to conclude that Lucan was perfectly innocent of the abject and unnatural treachery, of which Tacitus has ſuppoſed him guilty. Had the Poet really named his mother as his accomplice, would the vindic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ſanguinary Nero have ſpared the life of a woman, whoſe family he deteſted, particularly when other females were put to death for their ſhare in the conſpiracy? That Atilla was not in that number, the Hiſtorian himſelf informs us in the following remarkable ſentence,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0331500700:148"/>
Atilla mater Annaei Lucani, ſine abſolutione, ſine ſupplicio, diſſimulata; thus tranſlated by Gordon: "The information againſt Atilla, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lucan, was diſſembled; and, without being cleared, ſhe eſcaped unpuniſhed."</p>
                  <p>The preceding remarks will, I hope, vindicate to every candid mind the honour of our Poet; whoſe firmneſs and intrepidity of character are indeed very forcibly diſplayed in that picture of his death which Tacitus himſelf has given us. I ſhall preſent it to the Engliſh reader in the words of Gordon: — Lucan, "while his blood iſſued in ſtreams, perceiving his feet and hands to grow cold and ſtiffen, and life to retire by little and little to the extremities, while his heart was ſtill beating with vital warmth, and his faculties no wiſe impaired, recollected ſome lines of his own, which deſcribed a wounded ſoldier expiring in a manner that reſembled this. The lines themſelves he rehearſed; and they were the laſt words he ever uttered." The Annals of Tacitus, Book xv. — The critics differ concerning the verſes of the Pharſalia which the author quoted in ſo memorable a manner. I ſhall tranſcribe the two paſſages he is ſuppoſed to have repeated, and only add that Lipſius contends for the latter.</p>

                  <p>Such was the death of Lucan, before he had completed his twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeventh year. If his character as a man has been injured by the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, his poetical reputation has been treated not leſs injuriouſly by the Critics. Quintilian, by a frivolous diſtinction, diſputes his title to be claſſed among the Poets; and Scaliger ſays, with a brutality of language diſgraceful only to himſelf, that he ſeems rather to <hi>bark</hi> than to <hi>ſing.</hi> But theſe inſults may appear amply compenſated, when we remember, that in the moſt poliſhed nations of modern Europe the moſt elevated and poetic ſpirits have been his warmeſt admirers; that in France he was idolized by Corneille, and in England tranſlated by Rowe.—The ſevereſt cenſures on Lucan have proceeded from thoſe who have unfairly compared his language to that of Virgil: but how unjuſt and abſurd is ſuch a compariſon! it is comparing an uneven block of porphyry, taken rough from the quarry, to the moſt beautiful ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicies of poliſhed marble. How differently ſhould we think of Virgil as a poet, if we poſſeſſed only the verſes which he wrote at that period of life when Lucan compoſed his Pharſalia! In the diſpoſition of his ſubject, in the propriety and elegance of diction, he is undoubtedly far inferior to Virgil: but if we attend to the bold originality of his deſign, and to the vigour of his ſentiments; if we conſider the Pharſalia as the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0331500700:150"/>
rapid and uncorrected ſketch of a young poet, executed in an age when the ſpirit of his countrymen was broken, and their taſte in literature corrupted, it may juſtly be eſteemed as one of the moſt noble and moſt wonderful productions of the human mind.</p>

                  <p>Pompey, after his defeat at Pharſalia, proceeded to Leſbos, as he had left his wife Cornelia to the protection of that iſland; which received the unfortunate hero with a ſublime generoſity. The Leſbians entreated him to remain amongſt them, and promiſed to defend him. Pompey expreſſed his gratitude for their fidelity, but declined the offer, and embarked with Cornelia. The concern of this gallant people on the departure of their amiable gueſt is thus deſcribed by Lucan:

                  <q>Let Argentaria on your canvaſs ſhine.]</q>
                  <p>Polla Argentaria was the daughter of a Roman Senator, and the wife of Lucan. She is ſaid to have tranſcribed and corrected the three firſt books of the Pharſalia, after the death of her huſband. It is much to be regretted that we poſſeſs not the poem which he wrote on the merits of this amiable and accompliſhed woman; but her name is immortalized by two ſurviving Poets of that age. The veneration which ſhe paid to the memory of her huſband, is recorded by Martial; and more poetically deſcribed in that pleaſing and elegant little production of Statius, <hi>Genethliacon Lucani,</hi> a poem which I the more readily commend, as I may be thought by ſome readers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt towards its author, in omitting to celebrate his Thebaid. I confeſs, indeed, the miſcellaneous poems of Statius appear to me his moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable work: in moſt of theſe there is much imagination and ſentiment, in harmonious and ſpirited verſe. The little poem which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, on the anniverſary of Lucan's birth, is ſaid to have been written at the requeſt of Argentaria. The Author, after invoking the poetical deities to attend the ceremony, touches with great delicacy and ſpirit on the compoſitions of Lucan's childhood, which are loſt, and the Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalia, the production of his early youth; he then pays a ſhort compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the beauty and talents of Argentaria, laments the cruel fate which deprived her ſo immaturely of domeſtic happineſs; and concludes with the following addreſs to the ſhade of Lucan:

The Reader will pardon my recurring to this ſubject, as it is pleaſing to make uſe of every argument which may remove ſo odious and unjuſt a ſtain from a manly and exalted character.</p>

Indeed the merit of ſome Latin Poets, in a period that we commonly ſuppoſe involved in the groſſeſt barbariſm, is ſingularly ſtriking; many of theſe are of the Epic kind, and, as they deſcribe the manners and cuſtoms of their reſpective times, a complete review of them might form a curious and entertaining work. I ſhall briefly mention ſuch as appear moſt worthy of notice.</p>
                  <p>Abbo, a Pariſian monk, of the Benedictine order, wrote a poem on the ſiege of Paris by the Normans and the Danes, at which he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in the year 886: it is printed in the ſecond volume of Ducheſne's Script.Francorum; and, though it has little or no poetical merit, may be regarded as an hiſtorical curioſity. The following lines, addreſſed to the city of Paris, in the beginning of the work, may ſerve as a ſpecimen of its language:

William of Apulia compoſed, at the requeſt of Pope Urban the IId, a poem, in five books, on the actions of the Normans in Sicily, Apulia, and Calabria, to the death of Robert Guiſcard their prince; addreſſing

his work to the ſon of that hero. It was written between the years 1080 and 1099; firſt printed in 1582, 4to; and again in Muratori's Script. Ital. Du Cange, in his Notes to the Alexiad of the Princeſs Anna Comnena, has illuſtrated that hiſtory by frequent and long quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from William of Apulia; but though the learned Critic gives him the title of Scriptor Egregius, his poetry appears to me but a few de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ſuperior to that of the Monk Abbo, whom I have juſt mentioned.

                  <p>Gualfredo, an Italian, who ſucceeded to the biſhoprick of Siena in the year 1080, and died in 1127, wrote an Heroic poem on the expedition of Godfrey of Boulogne, which is ſaid to be ſtill preſerved in MS. at Siena. I believe Gualfredo is the firſt Poet, in point of time, who treated of the happy ſubject of the Cruſades; which was afterwards em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed by two very elegant writers of Latin verſe, Iſcanus and Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of whom I ſhall preſently ſpeak, and at length received its higheſt honour from the genius of Taſſo.

                  <p>Laurentius of Verona, who flouriſhed about the year 1120, wrote an Heroic poem, in ſeven books, entitled, Rerum in Majorica Piſanorum. Edidit Ughellus, tom. 3. Italiae ſacrae.</p>
                  <p>But in merit and reputation, theſe early Latin Poets of modern time are very far inferior to Philip Gualtier de Chatillon, who ſeems to have been the firſt that caught any portion of true poetic ſpirit in Latin verſe. He was Provoſt of the Canons of Tournay <note n="*" place="bottom">Fabricius calls him Epiſcopus Magalonenſis. Bib. Lat. tom. ii. p. 255.</note> about the year 1200, according to Mr. Warton, who has given ſome ſpecimens of his ſtyle in the ſecond Diſſertation prefixed to his admirable Hiſtory of Engliſh Poetry. I ſhall therefore only add, that the beſt edition of his Alexandreid, an Heroic
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0331500700:158"/>
poem in ten books on Alexander the Great, was printed at Leyden, 4to, 1558.</p>
                  <p>The ſuperior merit of Joſephus Iſcanus, or Joſeph of Exeter, has been alſo diſplayed by the ſame judicious Encomiaſt, in the Diſſertation I have mentioned; nor has he failed to commemorate two Latin Epic Poets of the ſame period, and of conſiderable merit for the time in which they lived—Gunther, and William of Bretagny; the firſt was a German monk, who wrote after the year 1108, and has left various hiſtorical and poetical works; particularly two of the Epic kind—Solymarium, a poem on the taking of Jeruſalem by Godfrey of Bulloign; and another, entitled Ligurinus, on the exploits of the Emperor Frederick Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſſa, which he completed during the life of that Prince. The firſt was never printed; of the latter there have been ſeveral editions, and one by the celebrated Melancthon, in 1569. That his poetical merit was conſiderable in many reſpects, will appear from the following verſes, in which he ſpeaks of himſelf.</p>

                  <p>William of Bretagny was preceptor to Pierre Charlot, natural ſon of Philip Auguſtus, King of France, and addreſſed a poem to his pupil, entitled Karlotis, which is yet unpubliſhed; but his greater work, called Philippis, an Heroic poem in twelve books, is printed in the collections of Ducheſne and Pithaeus; and in a ſeparate 4to volume, with a copious commentary by Barthius. Notwithſtanding the praiſes beſtowed on this Author by his learned Commentator, who prefers him to all his contemporaries, he appears to me inferior in poetic ſpirit to his three rivals, Gualtier de Chatillon, Iſcanus, and Gunther. Yet his work is by no means deſpicable in its ſtyle, and may be conſidered as a valuable picture of the times in which he lived; for he was himſelf engaged in many of the ſcenes which he deſcribes. His profeſt deſign is to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the exploits, of Philip Auguſtus; and he cloſes his poem with the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0331500700:159"/>
death of that Monarch, which happened in 1223. He addreſſes his work, in two ſeparate poetical dedications, to Lewis, the ſucceſſor of Philip, and to Pierre Charlot his natural ſon, who was Biſhop of Noyon in 1240, and died 1249, He ſeems to have been excited to this compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition by the reputation of Gualtier's Alexandreid; to which he thus alludes, in the verſes addreſſed to Lewis:

                  <p>He takes occaſion alſo, in two other parts of his poem, to pay a liberal compliment to Gualtier, to whom, in poetical ability, he confeſſes himſelf inferior; but this inferiority his admirer Barthius will not allow. Of their reſpective talents the reader may judge, who will compare the paſſage which Mr. Warton has cited from the Alexandreid, with the following lines, in which William of Bretagny uſes the very ſimile of his predeceſſor, comparing his hero Philip to a young lion.</p>

                  <p>In a few years after the death of Muſſato, Petrarch received the laurel at Rome, for his Latin Epic poem, entitled Africa; a performance which has ſunk ſo remarkably from the high reputation it once obtained, that the great admirer and encomiaſt of Petrarch, who has publiſhed three entertaining quarto volumes on his life, calls it "Un ouvrage ſans chaleur, ſans invention, ſans interet, qui n'a pas meme le merite de la verſification &amp; du ſtyle, &amp; dont il eſt impoſſible de ſoutenir la lecture.— I muſt obſerve, however, that Taſſo, in his Eſſay on Epic Poetry, beſtows a very high encomium on that part of Petrarch's Latin poem in which he celebrates the loves of Sophoniſba and Maſiniſſa; and indeed the cenſure of this amiable French writer, who in other points has done ample juſtice to the merits of Petrarch, appears to me infinitely too ſevere. There are many paſſages in this neglected Poem conceived with great force and imagination, and expreſſed with equal elegance of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.

                  <p>With Petrarch I may cloſe this curſory review of the neglected authors who wrote Heroic poems in Latin, during the courſe of the dark ages.—A peculiar circumſtance induces me to add another name to the preceding liſt. John, Abbot of Peterborough, in the reign of Edward the Third, wrote an Heroic poem, entitled Bellum Navarrenſe, 1366, de Petro rege Aragoniae, &amp; Edwardo Principe. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, containing five hundred and ſixty verſes, is ſaid to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in MS. in the Bodleian Library; and I have thought it worthy of notice, becauſe it treats of the very ſubject on which Dryden informs us he had once projected an Epic poem.</p>
                  <p>Of the many Latin compoſitions of the Epic kind, which later times have produced, the Chriſtiad of Vida, the Sarcotis of Maſſenius, and the Conſtantine of Mambrun, appear to me the moſt worthy of regard; but even theſe are ſeldom peruſed: and indeed the Poet, who in a poliſhed age prefers the uſe of a dead language to that of a living one, can only expect, and perhaps only deſerves, the attention of a few curious ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtered ſtudents.</p>

                  <q>Thy daring Dante his wild Viſion ſung.]</q>
                  <p>Dante Allighieri was born at Florence, in May 1265, of an ancient and honourable family. Boccacio, who lived in the ſame period, has left a very curious and entertaining Treatiſe, on the Life, the Studies, and Manners of this extraordinary Poet; whom he regarded as his maſter, and for whoſe memory he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the higheſt veneration. This intereſting biographer relates, that Dante, before he was nine years old, conceived a paſſion for the lady whom he has immortalized in his ſingular Poem. Her age was near his own; and her name was Beatrice, the daughter of Folco Portinari, a noble citizen of Florence. Of this fair one the beſt accounts are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure. Some refining commentators have even denied her corporeal exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; affirming her to be nothing more or leſs than Theology. But we may queſtion if Theology was ever the miſtreſs of ſo young a lover. The paſſion of Dante, however, like that of his ſucceſſor Petrarch, ſeems to have been of the chaſte and Platonic kind, according to the account he has himſelf given of it, in one of his early productions, entitled Vita Nuova; a mixture of myſterious poetry and proſe, in which he mentions both the origin of his affection and the death of his miſtreſs, who, according to Boccacio, died at the age of twenty-four. The ſame author aſſerts, that Dante fell into a deep melancholy in conſequence of this event, from which his friends endeavoured to raiſe him; by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading him to marriage. After ſome time he followed their advice, and repented it; for he unfortunately made choice of a lady who bore ſome reſemblance to the celebrated Xantippe. The Poet, not poſſeſſing the patience of Socrates, ſeparated himſelf from her with ſuch vehement expreſſions of diſlike, that he never afterwards admitted her to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, though ſhe had borne him ſeveral children.—In the early part of his life he gained ſome credit in a military character; diſtinguiſhing himſelf by his bravery in an action where the Florentines obtained a ſignal victory over the citizens of Arezzo. He became ſtill more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent by the acquiſition of civil honours; and at the age of thirty-five he roſe to be one of the chief magiſtrates of Florence, when that dignity was conferred by the ſuffrages of the people. From this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0331500700:166"/>
the Poet himſelf dated his principal misfortunes, as appears from the fragment of a letter quoted by Lionardo Bruni; one of his early biographers, where Dante ſpeaks of his political failure with that liberal frankneſs which integrity inſpires.—Italy was at that time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the contending factions of the Ghibellins and the Guelphs: the latter, among whom Dante took an active part, were again divided into the Blacks and the Whites. Dante, ſays Gravina, exerted all his influence to unite theſe inferior parties; but his efforts were ineffectual, and he had the misfortune to be unjuſtly perſecuted by thoſe of his own faction. A powerful citizen of Florence, named Corſo Donati, had taken meaſures to terminate theſe inteſtine broils, by introducing Charles of Valois, brother to Philip the Fair, King of France. Dante, with great vehemence, oppoſed this diſgraceful project, and obtained the baniſhment of Donati and his partizans. The exiles applied to the Pope (Boniface the VIIIth) and by his aſſiſtance ſucceeded in their deſign. Charles of Valois entered Florence in triumph, and thoſe who had oppoſed his admiſſion were baniſhed in their turn. Dante had been diſpatched to Rome as the ambaſſador of his party, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, when he received intelligence of the revolution in his native city. His enemies, availing themſelves of his abſence, had procured an iniquitous ſentence againſt him, by which he was condemned to baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and his poſſeſſions were confiſcated. His two enthuſiaſtic bio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers, Boccacio acid Manetti, expreſs the warmeſt indignation againſt this injuſtice of his country. Dante, on receiving the intelligence, took refuge in Siena, and afterwards in Arezzo, where many of his party were aſſembled. An attempt was made to ſurprize the city of Florence, by a ſmall army which Dante is ſuppoſed to have attended: the deſign miſcarried, and our Poet is conjectured to have wandered to various parts of Italy, till he found a patron in the great Can della Scala, Prince of Verona, whom he has celebrated in his Poem. The high ſpirit of Dante was ill ſuited to courtly dependence; and he is ſaid to have loſt the favour of his Veroneze patron by the rough frankneſs of his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. From Verona he retired to France, according to Manetti; and Boccacio affirms that he diſputed in the Theological Schools of Paris with great reputation. Bayle queſtions his viſiting Paris at this period of his life, and thinks it improbable, that a man, who had been one of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0331500700:167"/>
the chief magiſtrates of Florence, ſhould condeſcend to engage in the public ſquabbles of the Pariſian Theologiſts; but the ſpirit both of Dante, and the times in which he lived, ſufficiently account for this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his talents; and his reſidence in France at this ſeaſon is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Boccacio, in his life of our Poet, which Bayle ſeems to have had no opportunity of conſulting.</p>
                  <p>The election of Henry Count of Luxemburgh to the empire, in November 1308, afforded Dante a proſpect of being reſtored to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive city, as he attached himſelf to the intereſt of the new Emperor, in whoſe ſervice he is ſuppoſed to have written his Latin treatiſe De Monarchia, in which he aſſerted the rights of the Empire againſt the encroachments of the Papacy. In the year 1311, he inſtigated Henry to lay ſiege to Florence; in which enterprize, ſays one of his Biographers, he did not appear in perſon, from motives of reſpect towards his native city. The Emperor was repulſed by the Florentines; and his death, which happened in the ſucceeding year, deprived Dante of all hopes concerning his re-eſtabliſhment in Florence.</p>
                  <p>After this diſappointment, he is ſuppoſed to have paſſed ſome years in roving about Italy in a ſtate of poverty and diſtreſs, till he found an honourable eſtabliſhment at Ravenna, under the protection of Guido Novello da Polenta, the lord of that city, who received this illuſtrious exile with the moſt endearing liberality, continued to protect him through the few remaining years of his life, and extended his munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to the aſhes of the Poet.</p>
                  <p>Eloquence was one of the many talents which Dante poſſeſſed in an eminent degree. On this account he is ſaid to have been employed on fourteen different embaſſies in the courſe of his life, and to have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in moſt of them. His patron Guido had occaſion to try his abilities in a ſervice of this nature, and diſpatched him as his ambaſſador to negociate a peace with the Venetians, who were preparing for hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities againſt Ravenna. Manetti aſſerts that he was unable to procure a public audience at Venice, and returned to Ravenna by land, from his apprehenſions of the Venetian fleet; when the fatigue of his journey, and the mortification of failing in his attempt to preſerve his generous patron from the impending danger, threw him into a fever, which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in death on the 14th of September 1321. He died, however,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0331500700:168"/>
in the palace of his friend, and the affectionate Guido paid the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der regard to his memory. This magnificent patron, ſays Boccacio, commanded the body to be adorned with poetical ornaments, and, after being carried on a bier through the ſtreets of Ravenna by the moſt illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious citizens, to be depoſited in a marble coffin. He pronounced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the funeral oration, and expreſſed his deſign of erecting a ſplendid monument in honour of the deceaſed: a deſign which his ſubſequent misfortunes rendered him unable to accompliſh. At his requeſt, many epitaphs Were written on the Poet: the beſt of them, ſays Boccacio, by Giovanni del Virgilio of Bologna, a famous author of that time, and the intimate friend of Dante. Boccacio then cites a few Latin verſes, not worth tranſcribing, ſix of which are quoted by Bayle as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Dante himſelf, on the authority of Paul Jovius. In 1483 Bernardo Bembo, the father of the celebrated Cardinal, raiſed a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome monument over the neglected aſhes of the Poet, with the following inſcription:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Exigua tumuli Danthes hic ſorte jacebas</l>

                     <l>Nimirum Bembus, Muſis incenſus Etruſcis,</l>
                     <l>Hoc tibi, quem in primis hae coluere, dedit.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Before this period the Florentines had vainly endeavoured to obtain the bones of their great Poet from the city of Ravenna. In the age of Leo the Xth they made a ſecond attempt, by a ſolemn application to the Pope, for that purpoſe; and the great Michael Angelo, an enthuſiaſtic admirer of Dante, very liberally offered to execute a magnificent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument to the Poet. The hopes of the Florentines were again unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. The particulars of their ſingular petition may be found in the notes to Condivi's Life of Michael Angelo.</p>
                  <p>The perſon and manners of Dante are thus repreſented by the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive pen of Boccacia:—"Fu adunque queſto noſtro Pceta di Mezzana ſtatura; e poichè alla matura età fu pervenuto, andò alquanto gravetto, ed era il ſuo andar grave, e manſueto, di oneſtiſſimi panni ſempre veſtito,

e nel poto fu modeſtiſſimo.—Though Dante is deſcribed as much inclined to melancholy, and his genius particularly delighted in the gloomy and ſublime, yet in his early period of life he ſeems to have poſſeſſed all the lighter graces of ſprightly compoſition, as appears from the following airy and ſportive ſonnet:</p>

under all the diſadvantages of an unfortunate and agitated life. It does not appear at what time he completed it perhaps before he quitted Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona, as he dedicated the Paradiſe to his Veroneſe patron.—The Critics have variouſly accounted for his having called his poem Comedia. He gave it that title, ſaid one of his ſons, becauſe it opens with diſtreſs, and cloſes with felicity. The very high eſtimation in which this production was held by his country, appears from a ſingular inſtitution. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public of Florence, in the year 1373, aſſigned a public ſtipend to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon appointed to read lectures on the poem of Dante: Boccacio was the firſt perſon engaged in this office; but his death happening in two years after his appointment, his Comment extended only to the ſeventeen firſt Cantos of the inferno. The critical diſſertations that have been written on Dante are almoſt as numerous as thoſe to which Homer has given birth: the Italian, like the Grecian Bard, has been the ſubject of the higheſt panegyric, and of the groſſeſt invective. Voltaire has ſpoken of him with that precipitate vivacity, which ſo frequently led that lively Frenchman to inſult the reputation of the nobleſt writers. In one of his entertaining letters, he ſays to an Italian Abbé, "Je fais grand cas du courage, avec lequel vous avez oſé dire que Dante etoit un fou, et ſon ouvrage un monſtre—Le Dante pourra entrer dans les biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theques des curieux, mais il ne ſera jamais lu." But more temperate and candid Critics have not been wanting to diſplay the merits of this origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Poet. Mr. Warton has introduced into his laſt volume on Engliſh Poetry, a judicious and ſpirited ſummary of Dante's performance. We have ſeveral verſions of the celebrated ſtory of Ugolino; but I believe no entire Canto of Dante has hitherto appeared in our language, though his whole work has been tranſlated into French, Spaniſh, and Latin verſe. The three Cantos which follow, were tranſlated a few years ago, to oblige a particular friend. The Author has ſince been ſolicited to execute an entire tranſlation of Dante; but the extreme inequality of this Poet would render ſuch a work a very laborious undertaking, and it appears very doubtful how far ſuch a verſion would intereſt our country. Perhaps the reception of theſe Cantos may diſcover to the Tranſlator the ſentiments of the public. At all events, he flatters himſelf that the enſuing portion of a celebrated poem may afford ſome pleaſure from its novelty, as he has endeavoured to give the Engliſh reader an idea of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0331500700:172"/>
Dante's peculiar manner, by adopting his triple rhyme; and he does not recollect that this mode of verſification has ever appeared before in our language; it has obliged him of courſe to make the number of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated lines correſpond exactly with thoſe of the original. The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties attending this metre will ſufficiently ſhew themſelves, and obtain ſome degree of indulgence from the intelligent and candid reader.</p>

                  <q>The gay Boccacio, tempts th' Italian Muſe.</q>
                  <p>Boccacio was almoſt utterly unknown to our country as a Poet, when two of our moſt accompliſhed Critics reſtored his poetical reputation.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Tyrwhitt, to whom Chaucer is as deeply indebted as a Poet can be to the judgment and erudition of his commentator, has given a ſketch of Boccacio's Theſeida, in his introductory diſcourſe to the Canterbury Tales; and Mr. Warton has enriched the firſt volume of his Hiſtory of Engliſh Poetry with a conſiderable ſpecimen of this very rare Italian Epic poem, of which our country is ſaid to poſſeſs but a ſingle copy.—The father of Boccacio was an Italian merchant, a native of Certaldo, near Florence, who in his travels attached himſelf to a young woman of Paris; and our Poet is ſuppoſed to have been the illegitimate offspring of that connection. He was born in 1313, and educated as a ſtudent of the canon law; but a ſight of Virgil's tomb, according to Filippo Villani, his moſt ancient Biographer, made him reſolve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh his more irkſome purſuits, and devote himſelf entirely to the Muſes. His life ſeems to have been divided between literature and love, as he was equally remarkable for an amorous diſpoſition, and a paſſionate attachment to ſtudy. His moſt celebrated miſtreſs was Mary of Arragon, the natural daughter of Robert, King of Naples, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and enthuſiaſtic patron of Petrarch. To this lady, diſtinguiſhed by the name of The Fiammetta, Boccacio addreſſed his capital poem, the Theſeida; telling her, in an introductory letter, that it contained many alluſions to the particular circumſtances of their own ſecret attachment. In his latter days he retired to Certaldo, and died there in the year 1475, of a diſorder ſuppoſed to have ariſen from exceſſive application. Few authors have rendered more eſſential ſervice to the republic of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters than Boccacio, as he not only contributed very much to the improvement of his native language, but was particularly inſtrumental in promoting the revival of ancient learning: a merit which he ſhared with Petrarch. The tender and generous friendſhip which ſubſiſted between theſe two engaging authors, reflects the higheſt honour on both; and their letters to each other may be ranked among the moſt intereſting productions of that period. Boccacio compoſed, according
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0331500700:198"/>
to Quadrio, no leſs than thirty-four volumes. His Novels are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally known: his Poetical Works are as follow: 1. La Theſeida in Ottava Rima. 2. L'Amoroſa Viſione in Terza Rima. 3. Il Filoſtrato in Ottava Rima. 4. Il Ninfale Fieſolano in Ottava Rima.—He piqued himſelf on being the firſt Poet who ſung of martial ſubjects in Italian verſe; and he has been generally ſuppoſed the inventor of the Ottava Rima, the common Heroic meaſure of the Italian Muſe; but Quadrio has ſhewn that it was uſed by preceding writers; and Paſquier, in his Recherches, has quoted two ſtanzas of Thibaud king of Navarre, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the ſame meaſure, on Blanch queen of France, who died in 1252. The neglect into which the Poems of Boccacio had fallen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the more ſtriking, as he peculiarly prided himſelf on his poetical character; informing the world, by an inſcription on his tomb, that Poetry was his favourite purſuit—Studium fuit alma Poeſis, are the laſt words of the epitaph which he compoſed for himſelf.</p>

                  <q>She ſpoke exulting, and Triſſino ſung.</q>
                  <p>Giovanni Giorgio Triſſino was born of a noble family in Vicenza, 1478: he was particularly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by a paſſion for Poetry and Architecture; and one of the very few Poets who have been rich enough to build a palace. This he is ſaid to have done from a deſign of his own, under the direction of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Palladio. He had the merit of writing the firſt regular tragedy in the Italian language, entitled Sophoniſba; but in his Epic poem he is generally allowed to have failed, though ſome learned Critics (and Gravina amongſt them) have endeavoured to ſupport the credit of that performance. His ſubject was the expulſion of the Goths from Italy by Beliſarius; and his poem conſiſts of twenty-ſeven books, in blank verſe. He addreſſed it to the Emperor Charles the Vth; and profeſſes in his Dedication to have taken Ariſtotle for his preceptor, and Homer for his guide.</p>
                  <p>The reader will excuſe a trifling anachroniſm, in my naming Triſſino before Arioſto, for poetical reaſons. The Italia Liberata of the former was firſt publiſhed in 1548; the Orlando Furioſo, in 1515. Triſſino died at Rome, 1550; Arioſto at Ferrara, 1533.</p>

                  <p>The reputation of Torquato Taſſo has almoſt eclipſed that of his father Bernardo, who was himſelf a conſiderable Poet, and left two productions of the Epic kind, L'Amadigi, and Il Floridante: the latter remained unfiniſhed at his death, but was afterwards publiſhed in its imperfect ſtate by his ſon; who has ſpoken of his father's poetry with filial regard, in his different critical works. The Amadigi was written at the requeſt of ſeveral Spaniſh Grandees, in the court of Charles the Vth, and firſt printed in Venice by Giolito, 1560. The curious reader may find an entertaining account of the Author's ideas in compoſing this work, among his Letters, volume the firſt, page 198. I cannot help remarking, that the letter referred to contains a ſimile which Torquato has introduced in the opening of his Jeruſalem Delivered.</p>

The letters of their Poets, if properly ſelected, might alſo form a few intereſting volumes: as a proof of this, I ſhall inſert a ſhort letter of the younger Taſſo, becauſe it ſeems to have eſcaped the notice of his Biographers, and relates the remarkable circumſtance of his having deliberated on five different ſubjects before he decided in favour of Goffredo:

                  <q>Shall gay Taſſoni want his feſtive crown.</q>
                  <p>Aleſſandro Taſſoni, the ſuppoſed inventor of the modern Heroi-comic Poetry, was born at Modena, 1565. His family was noble; but his parents dying during his infancy, left him expoſed to vexatious law-ſuits, which abſorbed a great part of his patrimony, and rendered him dependant. In 1599 he was engaged as Secretary to Cardinal Aſcanio Colonna, whom he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on an embaſſy into Spain. He was occaſionally diſpatched into Italy on the ſervice of that Prelate, and in the courſe of one of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions wrote his Obſervations on Petrarch. In 1605 he is ſuppoſed
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0331500700:201"/>
to have quitted the ſervice of the Cardinal, and to have lived in a ſtate of freedom at Rome, where, in 1607, he became the chief of a literary ſociety, entitled Academia degli Umoriſti. He was afterwards em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ſervice of Charles Emanuel, Duke of Savoy; which, after ſuffering many vexations in it, he quitted with a deſign of devoting himſelf to ſtudy and retirement. But this deſign he was induced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh, and to ſerve the Cardinal Lodoviſio, nephew of Pope Gregory XV. from whom he received a conſiderable ſtipend. On the death of this patron, in 1632, he was recalled to his native city by Francis the Firſt, Duke of Modena, and obtained an honourable eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment in the court of that Prince. Age had now rendered him unable to enjoy his good fortune: his health declined in the year of his return, and he expired in April 1635. His genius was particularly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to lively ſatire; and the incidents of his life had a tendency to increaſe that diſpoſition. After having paſſed many vexatious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable years in the ſervice of the Great, he had his portrait painted, with a fig in his hand; and Muratori ſuppoſes him to have written theſe two lines on the occaſion:</p>
                  <q>

                  <p>His celebrated Poem, La Secchia rapita, was written, as he has him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf declared, in 1611; begun in April, and finiſhed in October. It was circulated in MS. received with the utmoſt avidity, and firſt printed at Paris 1622. In a catalogue of the numerous editions of the Secchia, which Muratori has prefixed to his Life of Taſſoni, he includes an Engliſh tranſlation of it, printed 1715.</p>

                  <p>The famous Lope de Vega, frequently called the Shakeſpear of Spain, is perhaps the moſt fertile Poet in the annals of Parnaſſus; and it would be difficult to name any author, ancient or modern, ſo univerſally idolized while living by all ranks of people, and ſo magnificently rewarded by the liberality of the Great. He was the ſon of Felix de Vega and Franciſca Fernandez,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0331500700:202"/>
who were both deſcended from honourable families, and lived in the neighbourhood of Madrid. Our Poet was born in that city, on the 25th of November 1562. He was, according to his own expreſſion, a Poet from his cradle; and, beginning to make verſes before he had learned to write, he uſed to bribe his elder ſcholl-fellows with a part of his breakfaſt, to commit to paper the lines he had compoſed. Having loſt his father while he was ſtill a child, he engaged in a frolic, very natural to a lively boy, and wandered with another lad to various parts of Spain, till, having ſpent their money, and being conducted before a magiſtrate at Segovia, for offering to ſell a few trinkets, they were ſent home again to Madrid. Soon after this adventure, our young Poet was taken under the protection of Geronimo Manrique, Biſhop of Avila, and began to diſtinguiſh himſelf by his dramatic compoſitions, which were received with great applauſe by the public, though their author had not yet completed his education; for, after this period, he became a member of the univerſity of Alcala, where he devoted himſelf for four years to the ſtudy of philoſophy. He was then engaged as Secretary to the Duke of Alva, and wrote his Arcadia in compliment to that patron; who is frequently mentioned in his Occaſional Poems. He quitted that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment on his marriage with Iſabel de Urbina, a lady (ſays his friend and biographer Perez de Montalvan) beautiful without artifice, and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous without affectation. His domeſtic happineſs was ſoon interrupted by a painful incident:—Having written ſome lively verſes in ridicule of a perſon who had taken ſome injurious freedom with his character, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a challenge in conſequence of his wit; and happening, in the duel which enſued, to give his adverſary a dangerous wound, he was obliged to fly from his family, and ſhelter himſelf in Valencia. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided there a conſiderable time; but connubial affection recalled him to Madrid. His wife died in the year of his return. His affliction on this event led him to relinquiſh his favourite ſtudies, and embark on board the Armada which was then preparing for the invaſion of England. He had a brother who ſerved in that fleet as a lieutenant; and being ſhot in an engagement with ſome Dutch veſſels, his virtues were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by our afflicted Poet, whoſe heart was peculiarly alive to every generous affection. After the ill ſucceſs of the Armada, the diſconſolate Lope de Vega returned to Madrid, and became Secretary to the Marquis
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0331500700:203"/>
of Malpica, to whom he has addreſſed a grateful Sonnet. From the ſervice of this Patron he paſſed into the houſehold of the Count of Lemos, whom he celebrates as an inimitable Poet. He was once more induced to quit his attendance on the Great, for the more inviting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of a married life. His ſecond choice was Juana de Guardio, of noble birth and ſingular beauty. By this lady he had two children; a ſon, who died in his infancy, and a daughter, named Feliciana, who ſurvived her father. The death of his little boy is ſaid to have haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened that of his wife, whom he had the misfortune to loſe in about ſeven years after his marriage. Having now experienced the precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of all human enjoyments, he devoted himſelf to a religious life, and fulfilled all the duties of it with the moſt exemplary piety; ſtill continuing to produce an aſtoniſhing variety of poetical compoſitions. His talents and his virtues procured him many unſolicited honours. Pope Urban the VIIIth ſent him the Croſs of Malta, with the title of Doctor in Divinity, and appointed him to a place of profit in the Apoſtolic Chamber; favours for which he expreſſed his gratitude by dedicating his Corona Tragica (a long poem on the fate of Mary Queen of Scots) to that liberal Pontiff. In his ſeventy-third year he felt the approaches of death, and prepared himſelf for it with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt compoſure and devotion. His laſt hours were attended by many of his intimate friends, and particularly his chief patron the Duke of Seſſa, whom he made his executor; leaving him the care of his daughter Feliciana, and of his various manuſcripts. The manner in which he took leave of thoſe he loved was moſt tender and affecting. He ſaid to his Diſciple and Biographer, Montalvan, That true fame conſiſted in being good; and that he would willingly exchange all the applauſes he had received, to add a ſingle deed of virtue to the actions of his life. Having given his dying benediction to his daughter, and performed the laſt ceremonies of his religion, he expired on the 25th of Auguſt 1635.</p>
                  <p>The ſplendor of his funeral was equal to the reſpect paid to him while living.—His magnificent patron, the Duke of Seſſa, invited the chief no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the kingdom to attend it. The ceremony was prolonged through the courſe of ſeveral days; and three ſermons in honour of the deceaſed were delivered by three of the moſt celebrated preachers. Theſe
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0331500700:204"/>
are printed with the works of the Poet, and may be conſidered as curious ſpecimens of the falſe eloquence which prevailed at that time. A vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of encomiaſtic verſes, chiefly Spaniſh, and written by more than a hundred and fifty of the moſt diſtinguiſhed characters in Spain, was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſoon after the death of this lamented Bard. To this collection his friend and diſciple Perez de Montalvan prefixed a circumſtantial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his life and death, which I have chiefly followed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding narrative. An ingenious Traveller, who has lately publiſhed a pleaſing volume of Letters on the Poetry of Spain, has imputed the duel in which Lope de Vega was engaged to the gallantries of his firſt wife; but Montalvan's relation of that adventure clears the honor of the lady, whoſe innocence is ſtill farther ſupported by a poem written in her praiſe by Pedro de Medina Medinilla: it is printed in the works of our Poet, who is introduced in it, under the name of Belardo, celebrating the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and lamenting the loſs of his departed Iſabel.</p>
                  <p>Of the perſon and manners of Lope de Vega, his friend Montalvan has only given this general account:—that his frame of body was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſtrong, and preſerved by temperance in continued health;—that in converſation he was mild and unaſſuming; courteous to all, and to women peculiarly gallant;—very eager when engaged in the buſineſs of his friends, and ſomewhat careleſs in the management of his own. Of his wealth and charity I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak in a ſubſequent note. The chief expences in which he indulged himſelf were books and pictures; of the latter, he diſtributed a few as legacies to his intimate friends: to the Duke of Seſſa, a fine portrait of himſelf; and to me, ſays Montalvan, another, painted when he was young, ſurrounded by dogs, monkies, and other monſters, and writing in the midſt of them, without attending to their noiſe.—Of the honours paid to this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Poet, his Biographer aſſerts that no perſon of eminence viſited Spain without ſeeking his perſonal acquaintance; that men yielded him precedence when they met him in the ſtreets, and women ſaluted him with benedictions when he paſſed under their windows. If ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage can be deſerved by the moſt unwearied application to poetry, Lope de Vega was certainly entitled to it. He declared that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly wrote five ſheets a day; and his biographers, who have formed a calculation from this account, conclude the number of his verſes to be
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0331500700:205"/>
no leſs than 21,316,000. His country has very lately publiſhed an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant edition of his poems in 19 quarto volumes; his dramatic works are to be added to this collection, and will probably be ſtill more volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. I ſhall ſpeak only of the former.—Among his poems there are ſeveral of the Epic kind; the three following appear to me the moſt remarkable. 1. La Dragontea. 2. La Hermoſura de Angelica. 3. La Jeruſalem Conquiſtada. The Dragontea conſiſts of ten cantos, on the laſt expedition and death of our great naval hero Sir Francis Drake, whom the Poet, from his exceſſive partiality to his country, conſiders as an ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricious pirate, or rather, as he chuſes to call him, a marine Dragon: and it may be ſufficient to obſerve that he has treated him accordingly. The poem on Angelica ſeems to have been written in emulation of Arioſto, and it is founded on a hint in that Poet: it was compoſed in the early part of our Author's life, and contains many compliments to his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Philip the IId: it conſiſts of 20 cantos, and cloſes with Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca's being reſtored to her beloved Medoro. In his Jeruſalem Conquiſtada he enters the liſts with Taſſo, whom he mentions in his preface as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſung the firſt part of the hiſtory which he had choſen for his ſubject. From the great name of Lope de Vega, I had ſome thoughts of preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the reader a ſketch of this his moſt remarkable poem; but as an Epic Poet he appears to me ſo much inferior to Taſſo, and to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman and cotemporary Ercilla, that I am unwilling to ſwell theſe extenſive notes by an enlarged deſcription of ſo unſucceſsful a work: the Author has propheſied in the cloſe of it, that, although neglected by his own age, it would be eſteemed by futurity:—a ſingular proof that even the moſt favoured writers are frequently diſpoſed to declaim againſt the period in which they live. If Lope de Vega could think himſelf neglected, what Poet may ever expect to be ſatisfied with popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar applauſe?—But to return to his Jeruſalem Conquiſtada. Richard the Second of England, and Alphonſo the Eighth of Caſtile, are the chief heroes of the poem; which contains twenty cantos; and cloſes with the unfortunate return of theſe confederate Kings, and the death of Saladin. It was firſt printed 1609, more than twenty years after the firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Taſſo's Jeruſalem.—One of the moſt amiable peculiarities in the character of Lope de Vega, is the extreme liberality with which he commends the merit of his rivals. In his Laurel de Apollo, he cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0331500700:206"/>
all the eminent Spaniſh and Portugueze Poets; he ſpeaks both of Camoens and Ercilla with the warmeſt applauſe. Among the moſt pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſages in this poem is a compliment which he pays to his father, who was, like the father of Taſſo, a Poet of conſiderable talents.</p>
                  <p>Among the ſmaller pieces of Lope de Vega, there are two particularly curious; a deſcriptive poem on the garden of his patron the Duke of Alva, and a ſonnet in honour of the Invincible Armada: the latter may be conſidered as a complete model of Spaniſh bombaſt: "Go forth and burn the world," ſays the Poet, addreſſing himſelf to that mighty fleet; "my ſighs will furniſh your fails with a never-failing wind; and my breaſt will ſupply your cannon with inexhauſtible fire."—Perhaps this may be equalled by a Spaniſh character of our Poet, with which I ſhall cloſe my imperfect account of him. It is his friend and biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Montalvan, who, in the opening of his life, beſtows on him the following titles: El Doctor Frey Lope Felix de Vega Carpio, Portento del Orbe, Gloria de la Nacion, Luſtre de la Patria, Oracula de la Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua, Centro de la Fama, Aſſumpio de la Invidia, Cuydado de la Fortuna, Fenix de los Siglos, Principe de los Verſos, Orfeo de las Ciencias, Apolo de las Muſas, Horacio de los Poetas, Virgilio de los Epicos, Homero de los Heroycos, Pindaro de los Lyricos, Sofocles de los Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicos, y Terencio de los Comicos, Unico entre los Mayores, Mayor entre los Grandes, y Grande a todas Luzes, y en todas Materias.</p>

                  <p>Don Alonzo de Ercilla y Zuniga was equally diſtinguiſhed as a Hero and a Poet; but this exalted character, notwithſtanding his double claim to our regard, is almoſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unknown in our country, and I ſhall therefore endeavour to give the Engliſh reader the beſt idea that I can, both of his gallant life, and of his ſingular poem.—He was born in Madrid, on the 7th of Auguſt 1533, the third ſon of Fortun Garcia de Ercilla, who, though deſcended from a noble family, purſued the profeſſion of the law, and was ſo remarkable for his talents, that he acquired the appellation of "The ſubtle Spaniard." The mother of our Poet was alſo noble, and from her he inherited his
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0331500700:207"/>
ſecond title, Zuniga: Ercilla was the name of an ancient caſtle in Biſcay, which had been long in the poſſeſſion of his paternal anceſtors. He loſt his father while he was yet an infant, a circumſtance which had, great influence on his future life; for his mother was received, after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of her huſband, into the houſehold of the Empreſs, Iſabella, the wife of Charles the Vth, and had thus an early opportunity of introducing our young Alonzo into the palace. He ſoon obtained an appointment there, in the character of page to the Infant Don Philip, to whoſe ſervice he devoted himſelf with the moſt heroic enthuſiaſm, though Philip was a maſter who little deſerved ſo generous an attachment. At the age of fourteen, he attended that Prince in the ſplendid progreſs which he made, at the deſire of his Imperial father, through the principal cities of the Netherlands, and through parts of Italy and Germany. This ſingular expedition is very circumſtantially recorded in a folio volume, by a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh hiſtorian named Juan Chriſtoval Calvete de Eſtrella, whoſe work affords a very curious and ſtriking picture of the manners and ceremonies of that martial and romantic age. All the cities which were viſited by the Prince contended with each other in magnificent feſtivity: the bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant ſeries of literary and warlike pageants which they exhibited, though they anſwered not their deſign of conciliating the affection of the ſullen Philip, might probably awaken the genius of our youthful Poet, and excite his ambition to acquire both poetical and military fame. In 1551, he returned with the Prince into Spain, and continued there for three years; at the end of which he attended his royal maſter to England on his marriage with Queen Mary, which was celebrated at Wincheſter in the ſummer of 1554. At this period Ercilla firſt aſſumed the military character; for his ſovereign received advice, during his reſidence at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that the martial natives of Aranco, a diſtrict on the coaſt of Chile, had revolted from the Spaniſh government, and diſpatched an experienced officer, named Alderete, who attended him in England, to ſubdue the inſurrection, inveſting him with the command of the rebellious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. Ercilla embarked with Alderete; but that officer dying in his paſſage, our Poet proceeded to Lima. Don Hurtado de Mendoza, who commanded there as Viceroy of Peru, appointed his ſon Don Garcia to ſupply the place of Alderete, and ſent him with a conſiderable force to oppoſe the Arancanians. Ercilla was engaged in this enterprize, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0331500700:208"/>
greatly diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the obſtinate conteſt which enſued. The noble character of the Barbarians who maintained this unequal ſtruggle, and the many ſplendid feats of valour which this ſcene afforded, led our author to the ſingular deſign of making the war, in which he was himſelf engaged, the ſubject of an Heroic poem; which he entitled "La Araucana," from the name of the country. As many of his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular adventures may be found in the following ſummary of his work, I ſhall not here enlarge on his military exploits; but proceed to one of the moſt mortifying events of his life; which he briefly mentions in the concluſion of his poem. After paſſing with great honour through many and various perils, he was on the point of ſuffering a diſgraceful death, from the raſh orders of his young and inconſiderate Commander. On his return from an expedition of adventure and diſcovery, to the Spaniſh city of Imperial, he was preſent at a ſcene of public feſtivity diſplayed there, to celebrate the acceſſion of Philip the IId to the crown of Spain; at a kind of tournament, there aroſe an idle diſpute between Ercilla and Don Juan de Pineda, in the heat of which the two diſputants drew their ſwords; many of the ſpectators joined in the broil; and, a report ariſing that the quarrel was a mere pretence, to conceal ſome mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous deſign, the haſty Don Garcia, their General, committed the two antagoniſts to priſon, and ſentenced them both to be publicly beheaded. Ercilla himſelf declares, he was conducted to the ſcaffold before his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate judge diſcovered the iniquity of the ſentence; but his innocence appeared juſt time enough to ſave him; and he ſeems to have been fully reinſtated in the good opinion of Don Garcia, as, among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimentary ſonnets addreſſed to Ercilla, there is one which bears the name of his General, in which he ſtyles him the Divine Alonzo, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates both his military and poetical genius. But Ercilla ſeems to have been deeply wounded by this affront; for, quitting Chile, he went to Callao, the port of Lima, and there embarked on an expedition againſt a Spaniſh rebel, named Lope de Aguirre, who, having murdered his captain, and uſurped the chief power, was perpetrating the moſt cruel enormities in the ſettlement of Venezuela. But Ercilla learned, on his arrival at Panama, that this barbarous uſurper was deſtroyed; he therefore reſolved, as his health was much impaired by the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips he had paſſed, to return to Spain. He arrived there in the twenty-ninth
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0331500700:209"/>
ninth year of his age; but ſoon left it, and travelled, as he himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, through France, Italy, Germany, Sileſia, Moravia, and Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia; but the particulars of this expedition are unknown. In the year 1570 he appeared again at Madrid, and was married to Maria Bazan, a lady whom he contrives to celebrate in the courſe of his military poem. He is ſaid to have been afterwards gentleman of the bed-chamber to the Emperor Rodolph the IId, a prince who had been educated at Madrid; but the connection of our Poet with this Monarch is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinctly recorded; and indeed all the latter part of his life is little known. In the year 1580 he reſided at Madrid, in a ſtate of retirement and poverty. The time and circumſtances of his death are uncertain: it is proved that he was living in the year 1596, by the evidence of a Spaniſh writer named Moſquera, who, in a treatiſe of military diſcipline, ſpeaks of Ercilla as engaged at that time in celebrating the victories of Don Alvaro Bazan, Marques de Santa Cruz, in a poem which has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appeared, and is ſuppoſed to have been left imperfect at his death. Some anecdotes related of our Poet afford us ground to hope that his various merits ware not entirely unrewarded. It is ſaid, that in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ſovereign Philip, he was ſo overwhelmed by diffidence that language failed him: "Don Alonzo! (replied the King) ſpeak to me in writing."—He did ſo, and obtained his requeſt. The Spaniſh Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian Ovalle, who has written an account of Chile, in which he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſupports his narration by the authority of Ercilla, affirms that our Poet preſented his work to Philip with his own hand, and received a recompence from the King. But in this circumſtance I fear the Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian was miſtaken, as he ſuppoſes it to have happened on the return of Ercilla from Chile; and our Poet, in a diſtinct portion of his work, which was not publiſhed till many years after that period, expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, in addreſſing himſelf to Philip, that all his attempts to ſerve him had been utterly unrequited. Ercilla left no legitimate family; but had ſome natural children, the moſt eminent of which was a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who was advantageouſly married to a nobleman of Portugal.</p>
                  <p>In that elegant collection of Spaniſh Poets, "<hi>Parnaſo Eſpan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ol,</hi>" there is a pleaſing little amorous poem, written by Ercilla in his youth, which is peculiarly commended by Lope de Vega; who has beſtowed a very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous encomium on our Poet, in his "<hi>Laurel de Apolo.</hi>" But the great

and ſingular work which has juſtly rendered Ercilla immortal, is his Poem entitled Araucana, which was publiſhed in three ſeparate parts: the firſt appeared in 1577; he added the ſecond in the ſucceeding year; and in 1590 he printed a complete edition of the whole. It was applauded by the moſt eminent writers of Spain; and Cervantes, in ſpeaking of Don Quixote's Library, has ranked it among the choiceſt treaſures of the Caſtilian Muſe. Voltaire, who ſpeaks of Ercilla with his uſual ſpirit and inaccuracy, has the merit of having made our Poet more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known, though his own acquaintance with him appears to have been extremely ſlight; for he affirms that Ercilla was in the battle of Saint Quintin: a miſtake into which he never could have fallen, had he read the Araucana. Indeed the undiſtinguiſhing cenſure which he paſſes on the poem in general, after commending one particular paſſage, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proves him a perfect ſtranger to many ſubſequent parts of the work; yet his remark on the inequality of the Poet is juſt. Ercilla is certainly unequal; but, with all his defects, he appears to me one of the moſt extraordinary and engaging characters in the poetical world. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I am a little partial to him, from the accidental circumſtance of having firſt read his poem with a departed friend, whoſe opinions are very dear to me, and who was particularly fond of this military Bard. However this may be, my idea of Ercilla's merit has led me to hazard the following extenſive ſketch of his Work: — it has ſwelled to a much larger ſize than I at firſt intended; for I was continually tempted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, by the deſire of not injuring the peculiar excellencies of this wonderful Poet. If I have not utterly failed in that deſire, the Engliſh reader will be enabled to judge, and to enjoy an author, who, conſidering his ſubject and its execution, may be ſaid to ſtand ſingle and unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled in the hoſt of Poets. His beauties and his defects are of ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious a nature, that I ſhall not enlarge upon them; but let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that his poem was compoſed amidſt the toils and perils of the moſt fatiguing and hazardous ſervice, and that his verſes were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times written on ſcraps of leather, from the want of better materials. His ſtyle is remarkably pure and perſpicuous, and, notwithſtanding the reſtraint of rhyme, it has frequently all the eaſe, the ſpirit, and the volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Homer. I wiſh not, however, to conceal his defects; and I have therefore given a very fair account of the ſtrange epiſode he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0331500700:211"/>
concerning the hiſtory of Dido, which has juſtly fallen under the ridicule of Voltaire. I muſt however obſerve, as an apology for Ercilla, that many Bards of his country have conſidered it as a point of honour to defend the reputation of this injured lady, and to attack Virgil with a kind of poetical Quixotiſm for having ſlandered the chaſtity of ſo ſpotleſs a heroine. If my memory does not deceive me, both Lope de Vega and Quevedo have employed their pens as the champions of Dido. We may indeed very readily join the laugh of the lively Frenchman

againſt our Poet on this occaſion; but let us recollect that Ercilla has infinitely more Homeric ſpirit, and that his poem contains more genuine Epic beauties, than can be found in Voltaire.</p>
                  <p>Ercilla has been honoured with many poetical encomiums by the writers of his own country; and, as I believe the moſt elegant compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which has been paid to his genius is the production of a Spaniſh lady, I ſhall cloſe this account of him with a tranſlation of the Sonnet, in which ſhe celebrates both the Hero and the Poet.</p>

                     <head>A SKETCH OF THE ARAUCANA.</head>
                     <p>THE Poem of Ercilla opens with the following expoſition of his ſubject:
<q>
                           <l>I Sing not love of ladies, nor of ſights</l>
                           <l>Devis'd for gentle dames by courteous knights,</l>
                           <l>Nor feaſts, nor tourneys, nor that tender care</l>
                           <l>Which prompts the Gallant to regale the Fair;</l>
                           <l>But the bold deeds of Valor's fav'rite train,</l>
                           <l>Thoſe undegenerate ſons of warlike Spain,</l>
                           <l>Who made Arauco their ſtern laws embrace,</l>
                           <l>And bent beneath their yoke her untam'd race.</l>
                           <l>Of tribes diſtinguiſh'd in the field I ſing;</l>
                           <l>Of nations who diſdain the name of King;</l>
                           <l>Courage, that danger only taught to grow,</l>
                           <l>And challenge honour from a generous foe;</l>
                           <l>And perſevering toils of pureſt fame,</l>
                           <l>And feats that aggrandize the Spaniſh name:</l>
                           <l>For the brave actions of the vanquiſh'd ſpread</l>
                           <l>The brighteſt glory round the victor's head.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He then addreſſes his work to his ſovereign, Philip the Second, and devotes his firſt Canto to the deſcription of that part of the new world which forms the ſcene of his action, and is called Arauco; a diſtrict in the province of Chile. He paints the ſingular character and various cuſtoms of its warlike inhabitants with great clearneſs and ſpirit. In many points they bear a ſtriking reſemblance to the ancient Germans, as they are drawn with a kind of poetical energy by the ſtrong pencil of Tacitus. The firſt Canto cloſes with a brief account how this martial province was ſubdued by a Spaniſh officer named Valdivia; with an
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0331500700:214"/>
intimation that his negligence in his new dominion gave birth to thoſe important exploits which the Poet propoſes to celebrate.</p>

                        <head>CANTO II.</head>
                        <p>ERCILLA begins his Cantos much in the manner of Arioſto, with a moral reflection; ſometimes rather too much dilated, but generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in eaſy, elegant, and ſpirited verſe.—The following lines faintly imitate the two firſt ſtanzas of his ſecond Canto:
<q>
                              <l>Many there are who, in this mortal ſtrife,</l>
                              <l>Have reach'd the ſlippery heights of ſplendid life:</l>
                              <l>For Fortune's ready hand its ſuccour lent;</l>
                              <l>Smiling ſhe rais'd them up the ſteep aſcent,</l>
                              <l>To hurl them headlong from that lofty ſeat</l>
                              <l>To which ſhe led their unſuſpecting feet;</l>
                              <l>E'en at the moment when all fears diſperſe,</l>
                              <l>And their proud fancy ſees no ſad reverſe.</l>
                              <l>Little they think, beguil'd by fair ſucceſs,</l>
                              <l>That Joy is but the herald of Diſtreſs:</l>
                              <l>The haſty wing of time eſcapes their ſight,</l>
                              <l>And thoſe dark evils that attend his flight:</l>
                              <l>Vainly they dream, with gay preſumption warm,</l>
                              <l>Fortune for them will take a ſteadier form;</l>
                              <l>She, unconcern'd at what her victims feel,</l>
                              <l>Turns with her wonted haſte her fatal wheel.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>After blaming his countrymen for abuſing their good fortune, the Poet celebrates, in the following ſpirited manner, the eagerneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation with which the Indians prepared to wreak their vengeance on their Spaniſh oppreſſors:
<q>
                              <l>The Indians firſt, by novelty diſmay'd,</l>
                              <l>As Gods rever'd us, and as Gods obey'd;</l>
                              <l>But when they found we were of woman born,</l>
                              <l>Their homage turn'd to enmity and ſcorn:</l>

                              <l>Fiercely they burnt, with anger and with ſhame,</l>

                              <l>To form of deep revenge their dire deſign.</l>

                        <p>The Poet proceeds to mention, in the manner of Homer, but in a much ſhorter catalogue, the principal chieftains, and the number of their reſpective vaſſals.</p>
                        <p>Uncouthly as their names muſt ſound to an Engliſh ear, it ſeems ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to run through the liſt, as theſe free and noble-minded ſavages act ſo diſtinguiſhed a part in the courſe of the poem.—Tucapel ſtands firſt; renowned for the moſt inveterate enmity to the Chriſtians, and leader of three thouſand vaſſals: Angol, a valiant youth, attended by four thouſand: Cayocupil, with three; and Millarapue, an elder chief,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0331500700:216"/>
with five thouſand: Paycabi, with three thouſand; and Lemolemo, with ſix: Maregnano, Gualèmo, and Lebopia, with three thouſand each: Elicura, diſtinguiſhed by ſtrength of body and deteſtation of ſervitude, with ſix thouſand; and the ancient Colocolo with a ſuperior number: Ongolmo, with four thouſand; and Puren, with ſix; the fierce and gigantic Lincoza with a ſtill larger train. Peteguelen, lord of the valley of Arauco, prevented from perſonal attendance by the Chriſtians, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches ſix thouſand of his retainers to the aſſembly: the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed of his party are Thomè and Andalican. The Lord of the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time province of Pilmayquen, the bold Caupolican, is alſo unable to appear at the opening of the council. Many other Chieftains attended, whoſe names the Poet ſuppreſſes, leſt his prolixity ſhould offend. As they begin their buſineſs in the ſtyle of the ancient Germans, with a plentiful banquet, they ſoon grow exaſperated with liquor, and a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent quarrel enſues concerning the command of the forces for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected war: an honour which almoſt every chieftain was arrogant enough to challenge for himſelf. In the midſt of this turbulent debate, the ancient Colocolo delivers the following harangue, which Voltaire prefers (and I think with great juſtice) to the ſpeech of Neſtor, on a ſimilar occaſion, in the firſt Iliad.</p>

                        <p>The Chieftains acquieſce in this propoſal; which, as Voltaire juſtly obſerves, is very natural in a nation of ſavages. The beam is produced, and of a ſize ſo enormous, that the Poet declares himſelf afraid to ſpecify its weight. The firſt Chieftains who engage in the trial ſupport it on their ſhoulders five and ſix hours each; Tucapel fourteen; and Lincoza more than double that number; when the aſſembly, conſidering his ſtrength as almoſt ſupernatural, is eager to beſtow on him the title of General; but in the moment he is exulting in this new honour, Caupolican arrives without attendants. His perſon and character are thus deſcribed by the Poet:
<q>
                              <l>Tho' from his birth one darken'd eye he drew</l>
                              <l>(The viewleſs orb was of the granate's hue)</l>
                              <l>Nature, who partly robb'd him of his ſight,</l>
                              <l>Repaid this failure by redoubled might.</l>
                              <l>This noble youth was of the higheſt ſtate;</l>
                              <l>His actions honour'd, and his words of weight:</l>
                              <l>Prompt and reſolv'd in every generous cauſe,</l>
                              <l>A friend to Juſtice and her ſterneſt laws:</l>
                              <l>Faſhion'd for ſudden feats, or toils of length,</l>
                              <l>His limbs poſſeſs'd both ſuppleneſs and ſtrength:</l>

                              <l>In every quick and hazardous exploit.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This accompliſhed Chieftain is received with great joy by the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; and, having ſurpaſſed Lincoza by many degrees in the trial, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with the ſupreme command. He diſpatches a ſmall party to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack a neighbouring Spaniſh fort: they execute his orders, and make
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0331500700:219"/>
a vigorous aſſault. After a ſharp conflict they are repulſed; but in the moment of their retreat Caupolican arrives with his army to their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. The Spaniards in deſpair evacuate the fort, and make their eſcape in the night: the news is brought to Valdivia, the Spaniſh Commander in the city of Conception;—and with his reſolution to puniſh the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians the canto concludes.</p>

He does not ſcruple to aſſert, that the enmity of the Indians aroſe from the avaricious ſeverity of their Spaniſh oppreſſors; and he accuſes Valdivia on this head, though he gives him the praiſe of a brave and gallant officer.—This Spaniard, on the firſt intelligence of the Indian inſurrection, diſpatched his ſcouts from the city where he commanded. They do not return. Preſſed by the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient gallantry of his troops, Valdivia marches out:—they ſoon diſcover the mangled heads of his meſſengers fixed up as a ſpectacle of terror on the road. Valdivia deliberates what meaſures to purſue. His army en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him to continue his march. He conſents, being piqued by their inſinuations of his diſgracing the Spaniſh arms. An Indian ally brings him an account that twenty thouſand of the confederated Indians are waiting to deſtroy him in the valley of Tucapel. He ſtill preſſes forward; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives

in ſight of the fort which the Indians had deſtroyed, and engages them in a moſt obſtinate battle; in the deſcription of which, the Poet introduces an original and ſtriking ſimile, in the following manner:
<q>
                              <l>The ſteady pikemen of the ſavage band,</l>
                              <l>Waiting our haſty charge, in order ſtand;</l>
                              <l>But when th' advancing Spaniard aim'd his ſtroke,</l>
                              <l>Their ranks, to form a hollow ſquare, they broke;</l>
                              <l>An eaſy paſſage to our troop they leave,</l>
                              <l>And deep within their lines their foes receive;</l>
                              <l>Their files reſuming then the ground they gave,</l>
                              <l>Bury the Chriſtians in that cloſing grave.</l>
                              <l>As the keen Crocodile, who loves to lay</l>

                              <l>Cloſing with eager haſte his hollow jaw,</l>

                              <l>So, in their toils, without one warning thought,</l>
                              <l>The murd'rous foe our little ſquadron caught</l>
                              <l>With quick deſtruction, in a fatal ſtrife,</l>
                              <l>From whence no Chriſtian ſoldier 'ſcap'd with life.</l>

                        <p>Such was the fate of the advanced guard of the Spaniards. The Poet then deſcribes the conflict of the main army with great ſpirit:—ten Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards diſtinguiſh themſelves by ſignal acts of courage, but are all cut in pieces. The battle proceeds thus:
<q>
                              <l>The hoſtile ſword, now deeply dy'd in blood,</l>
                              <l>Drench'd the wide field with many a ſanguine flood;</l>

                        <p>The Poet proceeds to relate the great agility and valor diſplayed by Lantaro, for ſuch is the name of this gallant and patriotic Youth: and, as Ercilla has a ſoul ſufficiently heroic to do full juſtice to the virtues of an enemy, he gives him the higheſt praiſe. Having mentioned on the occaſion many heroes of ancient hiſtory, he exclaims:
<q>

                              <l>Or match this young Barbarian's noble deed?</l>

                              <l>From ſhouting Triumph ruſh'd the palm to tear,</l>

                        <p>Caupolican, leading his army back to the charge, in conſequence of Lantaro's efforts in their favour, obtains a complete victory. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards are all ſlain in the field, except their Commander Valdivia, who flies, attended only by a prieſt; but he is ſoon taken priſoner, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted before the Indian Chief, who is inclined to ſpare his life; when an elder ſavage, called Leocato, in a ſudden burſt of indignation, kills him with his club.</p>
                        <p>All the people of Arauco aſſemble in a great plain to celebrate their victory: old and young, women and children, unite in the feſtival; and the trees that ſurround the ſcene of their aſſembly are decorated with the heads and ſpoils of their ſlaughtered enemies.</p>
                        <p>They meditate the total extermination of the Spaniards from their country, and even a deſcent on Spain.

In the midſt of the feſtivity, Caupolican receives advice that a party of fourteen Spaniſh horſemen had attacked ſome of his forces with great havoc. He diſpatches Lantaro to oppoſe them.</p>

                        <p>A PARTY of fourteen gallant Spaniards, who had ſet forth from the city of Imperial to join Valdivia, not being apprized of his unhappy fate, are ſurprized by the enemy where they expected to meet their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;—they defend themſelves with great valor. They are informed by a friendly Indian of the fate of Valdivia. They attempt to retreat; but are ſurrounded by numbers of the Araucanians:—when the Poet intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the following inſtance of Spaniſh heroiſm, which I inſert as a curious ſtroke of their military character:
<q>
                              <l>Here, cried a Spaniard, far unlike his race,</l>
                              <l>Nor ſhall his abject name my verſe debaſe,</l>
                              <l>Marking his few aſſociates march along,</l>
                              <l>O that our band were but a hundred ſtrong!</l>
                              <l>The brave Gonſalo with diſdain replied:</l>
                              <l>Rather let two be ſever'd from our ſide,</l>
                              <l>Kind Heaven! that Memory may our feats proclaim</l>
                              <l>And call our little troop The Twelve of Fame!</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>They continue to fight with great bravery againſt ſuperior numbers, when Lantaro arrives with a freſh army againſt them. Still undaunted, they only reſolve to ſell their lives as dear as poſſible. Seven of them are cut to pieces.—In the midſt of the ſlaughter a furious thunder and hail ſtorm ariſes, by which incident the ſurviving ſeven eſcape. The tempeſt is deſcribed with the following original ſimile:
<q>
                              <l>Now in the turbid air a ſtormy cloud</l>
                              <l>Spreads its terrific ſhadow o'er the crowd;</l>

                        <p>The few Spaniards that eſcape take refuge in a neighbouring fort; which they abandon the following day on hearing the fate of Valdivia. Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taro returns, and receives new honors and new forces from his General, to march againſt a Spaniſh army, which departs from the city of Penco under the command of Villagran, an experienced officer, to revenge the death of Valdivia. The departure of the troops from Penco is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and the diſtreſs of the women.—Villagran marches with expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition towards the frontiers of Arauco. He arrives at a dangerous paſs, and finds Lantaro, with his army of 10,100 Indians, advantageouſly poſted on the heights, and waiting with great ſteadineſs and diſcipline to give him battle.</p>

Thirteen of the moſt faithful ſoldiers of Villagran, perceiving their Leader fallen motionleſs under the fury of his enemies, make a deſperate effort to preſerve him.—Being placed again on his horſe by theſe generous deliverers, he recovers from the blow which had ſtunned him; and by ſingular exertion, with the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his ſpirited little troop, effects his eſcape, and rejoins his main army; whom he endeavours in vain to lead back againſt the triumphant Araucanians. The purſuit becomes general, and the Poet deſcribes the horrid maſſacre committed by the Indians on all the unhappy fugitives that fell into their hands.—The Spaniards in their flight are ſtopt by a narrow paſs fortified and guarded by a party of Indians. Villagran forces the rude entrenchment in perſon, and conducts part of his army ſafe through the paſs; but many attempting other roads over the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous country, are either loſt among the precipices of the rocks, or purſued and killed by the Indians.</p>

                        <p>LANTARO is recalled from his victorious exploits, to aſſiſt at a general aſſembly of the Indians, in the valley of Arauco. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Chieftains deliver their various ſentiments concerning the war, after their Leader Caupolican has declared his deſign to purſue the Spaniards with unceaſing vengeance. The veteran Colocolo propoſes a plan for their military operations. An ancient Augur, named Puche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calco, denounces ruin on all the projects of his countrymen, in the name of the Indian Daemon Eponamon. He recites the omens of their deſtruction. The fierce Tucapel, provoked to frenzy by this gloomy prophet, ſtrikes him dead in the midſt of his harangue, by a ſudden blow of his mace. Caupolican orders the murderous Chieftain to be led to inſtant death. He defends himſelf with ſucceſs againſt numbers who attempt to ſeize him. Lantaro, pleaſed by this exertion of his wonderful force and valour, intreats the General to forgive what had paſſed; and, at his interceſſion, Tucapel is received into favour. Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taro then cloſes the buſineſs of the aſſembly, by recommending the plan propoſed by Colocolo, and intreating that he may himſelf be entruſted with a detached party of five hundred Indians, with which he engages to reduce the city of Santiago. His propoſal is accepted. The Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, having finiſhed their debate, declare their reſolutions to their people; and, after their uſual feſtivity, Caupolican, with the main army, proceeds to attack the city of Imperial.</p>

The Viſion was followed by peſtilence and famine among the Indians. They remain inactive during the winter, but aſſemble again the enſuing ſpring in the plains of Arauco, to renew the war.

The youth Orompello, whom Leucoton had before ſurpaſſed in the conteſt of the lance, challenges his ſucceſsful rival to wreſtle: they engage, and fall together: the victory is diſputed. Tucapel demands the prize for his young friend Orompello, and inſults the General Caupolican. The latter is reſtrained from avenging the inſult, by the ſage advice of the veteran Colocolo, at whoſe requeſt he diſtributes prizes of equal value to each of the claimants. To prevent farther animoſities, they relinquiſh the reſt of the appointed games, and enter into debate on the war. Lantaro is again appointed to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a choſen troop, and marches towards the city of St. Jago. The Spaniards, alarmed at the report of his approach, ſend out ſome forces to reconnoitre his party: a ſkirmiſh enſues: they are driven back to the city, and relate that Lantaro is fortifying a ſtrong, poſt at ſome diſtance, intending ſoon to attack the city. Villagran, the Spaniard who commanded there, being confined by illneſs, appoints an officer of his own name to ſally forth, with all the forces he can raiſe, in queſt of the enemy. The Spaniards fix their camp, on the approach of night, near the fort of Lantaro: they are ſuddenly alarmed, and ſummoned to arms; but the alarm is occaſioned only by a ſingle horſe without a rider, which Lantaro, aware of their approach, had turned looſe towards their camp, as an inſulting mode of proclaiming his late victory, in which he had taken ten of the Spaniſh horſes.</p>
                        <p>The Spaniards paſs the night under arms, reſolving to attack the Indians at break of day. Lantaro had iſſued orders that no Indian ſhould ſally from the fort under pain of death, to prevent the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which the Spaniſh cavalry muſt have over his ſmall forces in the open plain. He alſo commanded his ſoldiers to retreat with an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of diſmay, at the firſt attack on the fort, and ſuffer a conſiderable number of the enemy to enter the place. This ſtratagem ſucceeds: the Spaniards ruſh forward with great fury: the Indians give ground, but,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0331500700:236"/>
ſoon turning with redoubled violence on thoſe who had paſſed their lines, deſtroy many, and oblige the reſt to ſave themſelves by a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate flight. The Indians, forgetting the orders of their Leader, in the ardour of vengeance ſally forth in purſuit of their flying enemy. Lantaro recalls them by the ſound of a military horn, which he blows with the utmoſt violence. They return, but dare not appear in the preſence of their offended Commander. He iſſues new reſtrictions; and then, ſummoning his ſoldiers together, addreſſes them, in a ſpirited, yet calm and affectionate harangue, on the neceſſity of martial obedience. While he is yet ſpeaking, the Spaniards return to the attack, but are again repulſed with great loſs. They retreat, and encamp at the foot of a mountain, unmoleſted by any purſuers.</p>

                        <p>THE Spaniards remain in their camp, while two of their adventurous ſoldiers engage to return once more to the fort, and examine the ſtate of it. On their approach, one of them, called Marcos Vaez, is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by his name, and promiſed ſecurity, by a voice from within the walls. Lantaro had formerly lived with him on terms of friendſhip, and now invites him into the fort. The Indian Chief harangues on the reſolution and the power of his countrymen to exterminate the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, unleſs they ſubmit. He propoſes, however, terms of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to his old friend Marcos, and ſpecifies the tribute he ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. The Spaniard anſwers with diſdain, that the only tribute the Indians would receive from his countrymen would be torture and death. Lantaro replies, with great temper, that arms, and the valour of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective nations, muſt determine this point; and proceeds to entertain his gueſt with a diſplay of ſix Indians, whom he had mounted and trained to exerciſe on Spaniſh horſes. The Spaniard challenges the whole party: Lantaro will not allow him to engage in any conflict, but diſmiſſes him in peace. He recalls him, before he had proceeded far from the fort, and, telling him that his ſoldiers were much diſtreſſed by the want of proviſion, entreats him to ſend a ſupply, affirming it to be true

heroiſm to relieve an enemy from the neceſſities of famine. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard ſubſcribes to the ſentiment, and engages, if poſſible, to comply with the requeſt. Returning to his camp, he acquaints his Commander Villagran with all that had paſſed; who, ſuſpecting ſome dangerous deſign from Lantaro, decamps haſtily in the night to regain the city. The Indian Chief is ſeverely mortified by their departure, as he had formed a project for cutting off their retreat, by letting large currents of water into the marſhy ground on which the Spaniards were encamped. Deſpairing of being able to ſucceed againſt their city, now prepared to reſiſt him, he returns towards Arauco, moſt ſorely galled by his diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and thus venting his anguiſh:

The Spaniards at St. Jago are eager to ſally in queſt of Lantaro, but their Commander Villagran was abſent on an expedition to the city of Imperial. In returning from thence he paſſes near the poſt. of Lantaro.

                        <p>THE Poet opens this canto with a lively panegyric on Love: he affirms that the greateſt Poets have derived their glory from their vivid deſcriptions of this enchanting paſſion; and he laments that he is precluded by his ſubject from indulging his imagination in ſuch ſcenes as are more likely to captivate a reader.</p>
                        <p>He ſeems to intend this as an apology (but I muſt own it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactory one) for deſerting the fair Guacolda, whom he mentions no more. He proceeds to deſcribe the ſharp conteſt which the undaunted Indians ſtill maintained in their fort:—they refuſe quarter, which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them by the Spaniſh Leader, and all reſolutely periſh with the brave and beloved Lantaro. The Poet then reſumes his account of the naval expedition from Peru to Chile; and concludes the canto with a ſpirited deſcription of a ſtorm, which attacked the veſſels as they arrived in ſight of the province to which they were ſteering.</p>

                        <p>THE ſtorm abates. The Spaniards land, and fortify themſelves on an iſland near the country of the Araucanians. The latter hold a council of war in the valley of Ongolmo. Caupolican, their General, propoſes to attack the Spaniards in their new poſt. The elder Chieftains diſſuade him from the deſign. A quarrel enſues between Tucapel and the aged Peteguelen:—they are appeaſed by a ſpeech of the venerable Colocolo; by whoſe advice a ſpirited and adroit young Indian, named Millalanco, is diſpatched, as a peaceful ambaſſador, to learn the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſigns of the Spaniards. He embarks in a large galley with oars, and ſoon arrives at the iſland. He ſurveys the Spaniſh implements of war with aſtoniſhment, and is conducted to the tent of the General, Don Garcia.</p>

                        <p>THE Indian addreſſes the Spaniſh officers with a propoſal of peace and amity. He is diſmiſſed with preſents. The Chieftains, on his return, pretend to relinquiſh hoſtilities; but prepare ſecretly for war. The Spaniards remain unmoleſted on the iſland during the ſtormy ſeaſon. They ſend a ſelect party of a hundred and thirty, including our Poet, to raiſe a fort on the continent: theſe execute their commiſſion with infinite diſpatch, and all the Spaniſh troops remove to this new poſt. The Araucanians are alarmed. An intrepid Youth, named Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colano, propoſes to the Indian General, Caupolican, to ſtorm the fort. The Indians advance near it, under ſhelter of the night. The Poet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes himſelf, at this juncture, as oppreſſed by the exceſſive labours of the day, and unable to purſue his poetical ſtudies according to his nightly cuſtom: the pen falls from his hand: he is ſeized with violent pains and tremblings: his ſtrength and ſenſes forſake him: but ſoon reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering from this infirmity, he enjoys a refreſhing ſleep. Bellona appears to him in a viſion, and encourages him both as a ſoldier and a poet. She conducts him, through a delicious country, to the ſummit of a moſt lofty mountain; when, pointing to a ſpot below, ſhe informs him it is St. Quintin, and that his countrymen, under the command of their ſovereign Philip, are juſt marching to attack it: ſhe adds, that her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is neceſſary in the midſt of that important ſcene; and leaves the Poet on the eminence to ſurvey and record the battle.</p>

                        <p>AFTER the Poet has deſcribed the ſucceſs of his royal maſter at St. Quintin, a female figure of a moſt venerable appearance, but without a name, relates to him prophetically many future events of great importance to his country. She touches on the diſturbances in the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0331500700:249"/>
Netherlands, the enterprizes of the Turks, and the exploits of Don John of Auſtria, at that time unknown to fame. Theſe ſhe hints very imperfectly, telling the Poet, that if he wiſhes for farther information, he muſt follow the ſteps of a tame deer, which he will find in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſpot; this animal will lead him to the cell of an ancient hermit, formerly a ſoldier, who will conduct him to the ſecret cave of the unſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Fiton, a mighty magician, who will diſplay to him the moſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous viſions. His female Inſtructor then adviſes him to mix ſofter ſubjects with the horrors of war, and to turn his eyes and his thoughts to the charms of the many Beauties who then flouriſhed in Spain. He beholds all theſe lovely fair ones aſſembled in a delicious paradiſe; and he is particularly attracted by a young lady, whoſe name he diſcovers to be Donna Maria Bazan (his future wife): in the moment that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to queſtion his Guide concerning this engaging Beauty, he is rouſed from his viſion by the ſound of an alarm. He ſnatches up his arms, and hurries to his poſt:—while the morning dawns, and the Indians begin to attack the fort.</p>

                        <p>THE Indians advance in three ſquadrons. The Youth Gracolano o'erleaps the trench, ſupported on a lofty pike, by which he alſo paſſes the wall. He defends himſelf in the midſt of the Spaniards with great ſpirit; but, finding himſelf unſupported, he wrenches a lance from a Spaniſh ſoldier, and tries to leap once more over the trench; but he is ſtruck by a ſtone while vaulting through the air, and falls, covered, as the Poet expreſsly declares, with two-and-thirty wounds. Some of his friends are ſhot near him; but the Indians get poſſeſſion of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish lance with which he had ſprung over the wall, and brandiſh it in triumph. The Spaniard, named Elvira, who had loſt his weapon, piqued by the adventure, ſallies from the fort, and returns, amid the ſhouts of his countrymen, with an Indian ſpear which he won in ſingle combat from a Barbarian, whom he had perceived detached from his

The head of the ancient Peteguelen is ſhot off; but Tucapel paſſes the wall, and ruſhes with great ſlaughter into the midſt of the enemy. The Spaniards who were in the ſhips that anchored near the coaſt haſten on ſhore, and march to aſſiſt their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen in the fort, but are attacked by a party of Indians in their march. The conflict continues furious on the walls; but the Indians at length retreat, leaving Tucapel ſtill fighting within the fort.</p>

The Spaniards ſally from the fort, but ſoon return to it, from the apprehenſion of an ambuſcade. They clear their trench, and ſtrengthen the weaker parts of their fortification. Night comes on. The Poet deſcribes himſelf ſtationed on a little eminence in the plain below the fort, which was ſeated on high and rocky ground:—fatigued with the toils of the day, and oppreſſed by the weight of his armour, which he continues to wear, he is troubled with a lethargic heavineſs; which he counteracts by exerciſe, declaring that his diſpoſition to ſlumber in his poſt aroſe not from any intemperance either in diet or in wine, as mouldy biſcuit and rain-water had been for ſome time his chief ſuſtenance; and that he was accuſtomed to make the moiſt earth his bed, and to divide his time between his poetical and his military labours. He then relates the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing nocturnal adventure, which may perhaps be conſidered as the moſt ſtriking and pathetic incident in this ſingular poem:

                        <p>As I have been tempted to dwell much longer than I intended on ſome of the moſt pathetic incidents of this extraordinary poem, I ſhall give a more conciſe ſummary of the remaining cantos.—On Ercilla's return, the Spaniards continue to ſtrengthen their fort. They receive intelligence from an Indian ally, that the Barbarian army intend a freſh aſſault in the night. They are relieved from this alarm by the arrival of a large reinforcement from the Spaniſh cities in Chile:—on which event Colocolo prevails on the Indians to ſuſpend the attack. Caupo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, the Indian General, reviews all his forces; and the various Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are well deſcribed. The Spanish Commander, Don Garcia, being now determined to march into the hoſtile diſtrict of Amuco, addreſſes ſoldiers in a ſpirited harangue, requeſting them to remember the pious, cauſe for which they fight, and to ſpare the life of every Indian who is diſpoſed to ſubmiſſion. They remove from their poſt, and paſs in boats over the broad river Biobio.</p>

                        <p>THE Spaniards are attacked in their new quarters—a ſurious battle enfues. The Spaniards are forced to give ground, but at laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. The Indian Chief, Rengo, ſignalizes himſelf in the action; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends himſelf in a marſh, and retreats in good order with his forces.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0331500700:257"/>
The Spaniards, after the conflict, ſeize an unhappy ſtraggling Youth, named Galvarino, whom they puniſh as a rebel in the moſt barbarous manner, by cutting off both his hands. The valiant Youth defies their cruelty in the midſt of this horrid ſcene; and, brandiſhing his bloody ſtumps, departs from his oppreſſors with the moſt inſulting menaces of revenge.</p>

                        <p>GALVARINO appears in the Aſſembly of the Indian Chieftains, and excites them, in a very animated ſpeech, to revenge the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with which he has been treated. He faints from loſs of blood, in the cloſe of his harangue, but is recovered by the care of his friends, and reſtored to health. The Indians, exaſperated by the ſight of his wounds, unanimouſly determine to proſecute the war. The Spaniards, advancing in Arauco, ſend forth ſcouts to diſcover the diſpoſition of the neighbouring tribes. Ercilla, engaging in this ſervice, perceives an old Indian in a ſequeſtered ſpot, apparently ſinking under the infirmities of age; but, on his approach, the ancient figure flies from him with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing rapidity. He endeavours in vain, though on horſeback, to overtake this aged fugitive, who ſoon eſcapes from his ſight. He now diſcovers the tame Deer foretold in his viſion; and, purſuing it, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted through intricate paths to a retired cottage, where a courteous old man receives him in a friendly manner. Ercilla enquires after the Magician Fiton: the old man undertakes to guide him to the ſecret manſion of that wonderful Necromancer, to whom he declares himſelf related. He adds, that he himſelf was once a diſtinguiſhed warrior; but, having the misfortune to ſully his paſt glory, without loſing his life, in a conflict with another Chieftain, he had withdrawn himſelf from ſociety, and lived twenty years as a hermit. He now leads Ercilla through a gloomy grove to the cell of the Magician, whoſe reſidence and magical apparatus are deſcribed with great force of imagination. Fiton appears from a ſecret portal, and proves to be the aged figure who had eſcaped ſo ſwiftly from the ſight of Ercilla. At the requeſt of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0331500700:258"/>
his relation, the old Warrior, he condeſcends to ſhew Ercilla the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his art. He leads him to a large lucid globe, ſelf-ſuſpended in the middle of an immenſe apartment. He tells him it is the work of forty years ſtudy, and contains an exact repreſentation of the world, with this ſingular power, that it exhibits, at his command, any ſcene of futurity which he wiſhes to behold:—that, knowing the heroic compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Ercilla, he will give him an opportunity to vary and embelliſh his poem by the deſcription of a moſt important ſea-fight, which he will diſplay to him moſt diſtinctly on that ſphere. He then invokes all the powers of the infernal world. Ercilla fixes his eye on the globe, and perceives the naval forces of Spain, with thoſe of the Pope and the Venetians, prepared to engage the great armament of the Turks.</p>

Ercilla gazes with great delight on this glorious action, and beholds the complete triumph of his countrymen; when the Magician ſtrikes the globe with his wand, and turns the ſcene into darkneſs. Ercilla, after being enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with other marvellous ſights, which he omits from his dread of prolixity, takes leave of his two aged friends, and regains his quarters. The Spaniards continue to advance: on their pitching their camp in a new ſpot, towards evening, an Araucanian, fantaſtically dreſt in armour, enquires for the tent of Don Garcia, and is conducted to his preſence.</p>

                        <p>THE Araucanian delivers a defiance to Don Garcia, in the name of Caupolican, who challenges the Spaniſh General to end the war by a ſingle combat. The meſſenger adds, that the whole Indian army will deſcend into the plain, on the next morning, to be ſpectators of the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0331500700:259"/>
duel. Don Garcia diſmiſſes him with an acceptance of the challenge. At the dawn of day the Indian forces appear in three diviſions. A party of Spaniſh horſe precipitately attack their left wing, before which Caupolican was advancing. They are repulſed. A general and obſtinate engagement enſues. The mangled Galvarino appears at the head of one Indian ſquadron, and excites his countrymen to revenge his wrongs. Many Spaniards are named who diſtinguiſh themſelves in the battle. Among the Indian Chiefs Tucapel and Rengo diſplay the moſt ſplendid acts of valour; and, though perſonal enemies, they mutually defend each other. Caupolican alſo, at the head of the left ſquadron, obliges the Spaniards to retreat; and the Araucanians are on the point of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deciſive victory, when the fortune of the day begins to turn.</p>

                        <p>THE reſerved guard of the Spaniards, in which Ercilla was ſtationed, advancing to the charge, recover the field, and oblige the main body of the Indians to fly. Caupolican, though victorious in his quarter, ſounds a retreat when he perceives this event. The Indians fly in great diſorder. Rengo for ſome time ſuſtains an unequal conflict, and at laſt retreats ſullenly into a wood, where he collects ſeveral of the ſcattered fugitives. As Ercilla happened to advance towards this ſpot, a Spaniard, called Remon, exhorts him by name to attempt the dangerous but important exploit of forcing this Indian party from the wood. His honour being thus piqued, he ruſhes forward with a few followers, and, after an obſtinate engagement, in which many of the Indians are cut to pieces, the Spaniards obtain the victory, and return to their camp with ſeveral priſoners. After this great defeat of the Indian army, the Spaniards, to deter their enemies from all future reſiſtance, barbarouſly reſolve to execute twelve Chieftains of diſtinction, whom they find among their captives, and to leave their bodies expoſed on the trees that ſurrounded the field of battle. The generous Ercilla, lamenting this inhuman ſentence, intercedes particularly for the life of one, alledging
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0331500700:260"/>
that he had ſeen him united with the Spaniards. This perſon proves to be Galvarino; who, on hearing the interceſſion for his life, produces his mangled arms, which he had concealed in his boſom, and, giving vent to his deteſtation of the Spaniards, inſiſts on dying with his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Ercilla perſiſts in vain in his endeavour to ſave him. As, no executioner could be found among the Spaniſh ſoldiers, a new mode of deſtruction, ſays our Poet, was invented; and every Indian was ordered to terminate his own life by a cord which was given him. Theſe brave men haſtened to accompliſh their fate with as much alacrity, continues Ercilla, as the moſt ſpirited warrior marches to an attack. One alone of the twelve begins to heſitate, and pray for mercy; declaring himſelf the lineal deſcendant of the moſt ancient race and ſovereign of the country. He is interrupted by the reproaches of the impetuous Galva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino, and, repenting his timidity, atones for it by inſtant death.</p>
                        <p>The Spaniards advance ſtill farther in the country and raiſe a fort where Valdivia had periſhed. Ercilla finds his old friend the Magician once more, who tells him that Heaven thought proper to puniſh the pride of the Araucanians by their late defeat; but that the Spaniards would ſoon pay dearly for their preſent triumph. The Wizard retires after this prophecy, and, with much intreaty, allows Ercilla to follow him. Coming to a gloomy rock, he ſtrikes it with his wand; a ſecret door opens, and they enter into a delicious garden, which the Poet commends for its ſymmetry, expreſsly declaring that every hedge <hi>has its brother.</hi> The Magician leads him into a vault of alabaſter; and, perceiving his wiſh, though he does not expreſs it, of ſeeing the miraculous globe again, the courteous Fiton conducts him to it.</p>

                        <p>THE Magician diſplays to our Poet the various countries of the globe; particularly pointing out to him the ancient caſtle of Ercilla, the ſeat of his anceſtors in Biſcay, and the ſpot where his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Philip the Second was ſoon to build his magnificent palace, the Eſcurial. Having ſhewn him the various nations of the earth on his marvellous ſphere, Fiton conducts his gueſt to the road leading to the

Spaniſh camp, where the ſoldiers of Ercilla were ſeeking their officer. The Spaniards in vain attempt to ſooth and to terrify the Araucanians into peace; and, finding the importance of their preſent poſt, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to ſtrengthen it. Ercilla proceeds with a party to the city of Imperial, to provide neceſſaries for this purpoſe. On his return, as he is marching through the country of ſome pacific Indians, he diſcovers, at the cloſe of day, a diſtreſt female, who attempts to fly, but is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by Ercilla.</p>

                        <p>THE fair fugitive, whom our Poet deſcribes as ſingularly beautiful, relates her ſtory. She tells him her name is Glaura, the daughter of an opulent Chieftain, with whom ſhe lived moſt happily, till a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of her father's, who frequently reſided with him, perſecuted her with an unwarrantable paſſion;—that ſhe in vain repreſented to him the impious nature of his love;—he perſiſted in his frantic attachment, and, on the appearance of a hoſtile party of Spaniards, ruſhed forth to die in her defence, intreating her to receive his departing ſpirit. He fell in the action; her father ſhared the ſame fate: ſhe herſelf eſcaped at a poſtern gate into the woods. Two negroes, laden with ſpoil, diſcovered, and ſeized her. Her cries brought a young Indian, named Cariolano, to her reſcue: he ſhot an arrow into the heart of the firſt ruſſian, and ſtabbed the ſecond. Glaura expreſſed her gratitude by receiving her young deliverer as her huſband. Before they could regain a place of ſafety, they were alarmed by the approach of Spaniards. The generous Youth intreated Glaura to conceal herſelf in a tree, while he ventured to meet the enemy. In her terror ſhe ſubmitted to this expedient, which, on recovery from her panic, ſhe bitterly repented; for when ſhe iſſued from her retreat, ſhe ſought in vain for Cariolano, and ſuppoſed, from the clamour ſhe had heard, that he muſt have periſhed. She continued to wander in this wretched ſtate of mind, ſtill unable to hear any tidings of her protector. While the fair Indian thus cloſes her narrative, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla is alarmed by the approach of a large party of Barbarians. One of his faithful Indian attendants, whom he had lately attached to him,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0331500700:262"/>
intreats him to eſcape with the utmoſt haſte; adding, that he can ſave him from purſuit by his knowledge of the country; and that he will riſque his own life moſt willingly, to preſerve that of Ercilla. Glaura burſts into an agony of joy, in diſcovering her loſt Cariolano in this faithful attendant. Ercilla exclaims, <q>Adieu, my friends; I give you both your liberty, which is all I have at preſent to beſtow,</q> and rejoins his little troop. Before he enters on the account of what followed, he relates the circumſtance by which he attached Cariolano to his ſervice; whom he had found alone, as he himſelf was marching with a ſmall party, and a few priſoners that he had taken. The Youth at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelf, and ſhot two Spaniards with his arrows, and continued to reſiſt the numbers that preſſed upon him, with his mantle and his dagger evading their blows by his extreme agility, and wounding ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral.

The Youth, in conſequence of this treatment, flung down his dagger, and became the affectionate attendant of Ercilla. Our Poet, after relating this incident, returns to the ſcene where his party was ſurprized in a hollow road, and ſeverely galled by the enemy, who attacked them with ſhowers of ſtones from the higher ground. Ercilla forces his way up the precipice, and, after diſperſing part of the Indian force, effects his eſcape with a few followers; but all are wounded, and obliged to leave their baggage in the poſſeſſion of their numerous enemies.</p>

They recover, and are reconciled. The Spaniards, leaving a garriſon in their new fort, under a captain named Reynoſo, had proceeded to the city of Imperial. Caupolican endeavours to take advantage of this event. He employs an artful Indian, named Pran, to examine the ſtate of the fort. Pran inſinuates himſelf among the Indian ſervants belonging to the Spaniards. He views the fort, and endeavours to perſuade a ſervile Indian, named Andreſillo, to admit Caupolican and his forces while the. Spaniards are ſleeping.

The ambaſſadors of Iar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas arrive at Carthage, to offer this celebrated Queen the alternative of marriage or war. The Senate, who are firſt informed of the propoſal, being fearful that the chaſte reſolutions of their fair Sovereign may ruin their country, attempt to engage her, by a ſingular device, to accept the hand of Iarbas. They tell her, that this haughty Monarch has ſent to demand twenty of her privy counſellors to regulate his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and that, in conſideration of their age and infirmities, they muſt decline ſo unpleaſant a ſervice. The Queen repreſents to them the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their refuſal, and the duty which they owe to their country; declaring, that ſhe would moſt readily ſacrifice her own life for the ſafety or advantage of her ſubjects. The Senators then reveal to her the real

demand of Iarbas, and urge the neceſſity of her marriage for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſtate. The faithful Dido knows not what to reſolve, and demands three months to conſider of this delicate and important point: —at the cloſe of that period, ſhe aſſembles her ſubjects; and, taking leave of them in a very affectionate harangue, declares her reſolution to die, as the only means by which ſhe can at once ſatisfy both Heaven and earth, by diſcharging her duty to her people, and at the ſame time preſerving her faith inviolate to her departed Sichaeus. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking his name, ſhe plunges a poniard in her breaſt; and throws herſelf on a flaming pile, which had been kindled for a different ſacrifice. Her grateful ſubjects lament her death, and pay divine honours to her memory. "This <note n="*" place="bottom">

He conducts the Spaniards to a ſpot near the ſequeſtered retreat of Caupolican, and directs them how to diſcover it; but refuſes to advance with them, overcome by his dread of the Hero whom he is tempted to betray. The Spaniards ſurround the houſe in which the Chieftain had taken refuge with his ten faithful aſſociates. Alarmed by a centinel, he prepares for defence; but being ſoon wounded in the arm, ſurrenders, endeavouring to conceal his high character, and to make the Spaniards believe him an ordinary ſoldier.</p>

                        <p>CAUPOLICAN entreats Reynoſo to grant his life, but without any ſigns of terror. He affirms it will be the only method of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing the ſanguinary hatred by which the contending nations are inflamed; and he offers, from his great influence over his country, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the Chriſtian worſhip, and to bring the Araucanians to conſider themſelves as the ſubjects of the Spaniſh Monarch. His propoſals are rejected, and he is ſentenced to be impaled, and ſhot to death with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. He is unappall'd by this decree; but firſt deſires to be publicly baptized: after which ceremony, he is inhumanly led in chains to a ſcaffold. He diſplays a calm contempt of death; but, on ſeeing a wretched Negro appointed his executioner, his indignation burſts forth, and he hurls the Negro from the ſcaffold, entreating to die by a more honourable hand. His horrid ſentence is however executed. He ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the agonies of the ſtake with patient intrepidity, till a choſen band of archers put a period to his life.</p>
                        <p>Our brave Ercilla expreſſes his abhorrence of this atrocious ſcene; and adds, that if he had been preſent, this cruel execution ſhould not have taken place.</p>
                        <p>The conſequence of it was ſuch as Caupolican foretold:—the Arau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canians determine to revenge his death, and aſſemble to elect a new Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.

The Poet makes an abrupt tranſition from their debate, to relate the adventures of Don Garcia, with whom he was himſelf marching to explore new regions. The inhabitants of the diſtricts they invade, alarmed at the approach of the Spaniards, conſult on the occaſion. An Indian, named Tunconabala, who had ſerved under the Araucanians, addreſſes the aſſembly, and recommends to them a mode of eluding the ſuppoſed avaricious deſigns of the Spaniards, by ſending meſſengers to them, who ſhould aſſume an appearance of extreme poverty, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their country as barren, and thus induce the invaders to turn their arms towards a different quarter. He offers to engage in this ſervice himſelf. The Indians adopt the project he recommends, and remove their valuable effects to the interior parts of their country.</p>

                        <p>DON GARCIA being arrived at the boundaries of Chile, which no Spaniard had paſſed, encourages his ſoldiers, in a ſpirited ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, to the acquiſition of the new provinces which lay before them. They enter a rude and rocky country, in which they are expoſed to many hazards by their deceitful guides. Tunconabala meets them, as he had projected, with the appearance of extreme poverty; and, after many aſſurances of the ſterility of that region, adviſes them to return, or to advance by a different path, which he repreſents to them as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, but the only practicable road. On finding them reſolved to preſs forward, he ſupplies them with a guide. They advance, with great toil and danger. Their guide eſcapes from them. They continue their march, through various hardſhips, in a deſolate region. They at length diſcover a fertile plain, and a large lake with many little inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited iſlands. As they approach the lake, a large gondola, with twelve oars, advances to meet them: the party it contained leap aſhore, and ſalute the Spaniards with expreſſions of amity.</p>

                        <p>THE young Chieftain of the gondola ſupplies the Spaniards with proviſions, refuſing to accept any reward: and our Poet celebrates all the inhabitants of this region, for their amiable ſimplicity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. He viſits one of the principal iſlands, where he is kindly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. He diſcovers that the lake had a communication with the ſea, by a very rough and dangerous channel: this circumſtance obliges the Spaniards, though reluctant, to return. They lament the neceſſity of paſſing again through the hardſhips of their former road. A young In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian undertakes to conduct them by an eaſier way. But our adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Ercilla, before the little army ſet forth on their return, engages ten choſen aſſociates to embark with him in a ſmall veſſel, and paſs the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous channel. He lands on a wild and ſandy ſpot, and, advancing half a mile up the country, engraves a ſtanza, to record this adventure, on the bark of a tree. He repaſſes the channel, and rejoins the Spaniſh troops; who, after much difficulty, reach the city of Imperial. Our Poet then touches on ſome particulars of his perſonal hiſtory, which I mention in the ſlight ſketch of his life. He afterwards promiſes his reader to relate the iſſue of the debate among the Araucanian Chieftains, on the election of their new General; but, recollecting in the inſtant that Spain herſelf is in arms, he entreats the favour of his Sovereign to inſpire him with new ſpirit, that he may devote himſelf to that higher and more intereſting ſubject.</p>

Theſe, as they are illuſtrated by the Spaniſh notes of his indefatigable Commentator, <hi>Manuel de Faria,</hi> amount to two volumes in folio.

It may amuſe a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reader to compare both Camoens and Petrarch, on this occaſion, with Milton, who has alſo written a Sonnet on the ſame ſubject. The Commentator Faria has a very pleaſant remark on this ſpecies of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. He vindicates the dignity of the amorous Sonnet, by producing an alphabetical liſt of two hundred great Poets, who have thus compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the object of their affection; and he very gravely introduces Achilles as the leader of this choir, for having celebrated Briſeis. If the Sonnets of the Portugueze Poet are worthy of attention, his Elegies are perhaps ſtill more ſo, as they illuſtrate many particulars of his intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, which ended in 1579, under the moſt cruel circumſtances of neglect and poverty.</p>

The Malaca Conquiſtada of Franciſco de Sa' de Meneſis—and the Ulyſſea, or Liſboa Edificada, of Gabriel Pereira de Caſtro, are two of the moſt eminent among its ſucceſſors.— For a liſt of the Portugueze Epic Poets, and for an elegant copy of the Malaca Conquiſtada, I am indebted to the very liberal politeneſs of the Chevalier de Pinto, the Ambaſſador of Portugal.</p>

                  <p>Before the appearance of Boſſu's celebrated treatiſe on Epic poetry, the French had a ſimilar work written in Latin. The learned Jeſuit Mambrun publiſhed, in 1652, a quarto volume, entitled, Diſſertatio Peripatetica de Epico Carmine. His Diſſertation is founded on the principles of Ariſtotle, whom he conſiders as infallible authority; and he introduces the Greek Philoſopher to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the following very curious queſtion, which he argues with becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gravity, Whether the action of a woman can be ſufficiently ſplendid to prove a proper ſubject for an Epic poem.—Having reaſoned on this delicate point, with more learning than gallantry, he thus concludes the debate: Congruenter magis finem huic quaeſtioni ponere non licet, quam verbis Ariſtotelis capite 15 Poeticae, ubi de moribus diſputat, <gap reason="foreign">

The famous Chapelain, in the preface to his unfortunate Pucelle, has very warmly attacked theſe ungallant maxims of Mambrun and Ariſtotle. In ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of certain critics, who had cenſured the choice of his ſubject, before the publication of his poem, he ſays, Ceux-cy, jurant ſur le texte d'A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtote,

Ils n'eſtiment ce Sexe capable d'au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cune penſée heroique, dans la creance que l'eſprit ſuit le temperament du corps, et que, dans le corps de la femme, l'eſprit ne peut rien conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir, qui ne ſe ſente de ſa foibleſſe. — Ces Meſſieurs me pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neront, toutefois, ſi je leur dis qu'ils ne conſiderent pas trop bien quelle eſt la nature de la vertu heroique, qu'ils en definiſſent l'eſſence, par un de ſes moindres accidens, et qu'ils en font plutoſt une vertu brutale, qu'une vertu divine.— Ils ſe devroient ſouvenir que cette vertu n'a preſque rien à faire avec le corps, et qu'elle conſiſte, non dans les efforts d'un Milon de Crotone, où l'eſprit n'a aucune part, mais en ceux des ames nées pour les grandes choſes; quand par une ardeur pluſqu' hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, elles s'elevent audeſſus d'elles-meſmes; qu'elles forment quelque deſſein, dont l'utilité eſt auſſi grande que la difficulté, et qu'elles choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſent les moyens de l'executer avec conſtance et hauteur de courage. Pour prevenus qu'ils ſoient en faveurs des hommes, je ne penſe pas qu'ils vouluſſent attribuer à leur ame un ſeul avantage, auquel l'ame de la femme ne puſt aſpirer, ni faire deux eſpeces des deux ſexes, deſquels la raiſon de tous les ſages n'a fait qu'une juſqu'icy—je ne croy pas non plus qu'ils imaginent que les vertus morales ayent leur ſiege ailleurs, que dans la volonté, ou dans l'entendement. Mais ſi elles y ont leur ſiege, et ſi l'on ne peut dire que ces deux facultés ſoient autres, dans l'ame de la femme que dans l'ame de l'homme, ils ne peuvent, ſans abſurdité, accorder une de ces vertus à l' homme, et ne l' accorder pas à la femme. En effet, cette belle penſée d'Ariſtote qui a donné occaſion à leur erreur, eſt ſi peu phyſique, qu'elle fait plus de tort à la philoſophie du Lycée, qu'elle n'appuye l'opinion de ceux que nous combattons." Chapelain then enters into an hiſtorical defence of Female dignity, and oppoſes the authority of Plato to that of Ariſtotle, concerning the propriety of woman's ever appearing on the great theatre of active life. Happy had he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported

the Female cauſe as forcibly, in the execution of his poem, as in the arguments of his preface: but Chapelain was unfortunately one of the many examples, which every country affords, that the moſt perfect union of virtue and erudition is utterly inſufficient to form a Poet; and, as he had the ill fate to be perſecuted by the pitileſs rigour of Boileau, his inharmonious poem can never ſink into a deſirable oblivion. The treatiſe of Mambrun ſeems to have excited, among the French, an eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to diſtinguiſh themſelves in the field of Epic poetry; for ſeveral Epic poems were publiſhed in France in a few years after that work appeared; but moſt of them, and particularly thoſe on ſcriptural ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, were hardly ever known to exiſt.</p>

The Satiriſt being aſked, why he had never mentioned the poetry of Le Moine? replied with the two following verſes, parodied from Corneille,

I can ſpeak only from the opinion of this learned Critic, for the neglected French Poet is become ſo rare, that I have ſought in vain for a copy of his work.—The number of obſcure Epic writers in France is very trifling, compared to thoſe which Italy has produced; the Italians have been indefatigable in this ſpecies of compoſition, and, as if they had reſolved to leave no Hero unſung, their celebrated Noveliſt, Giraldi

                  <q>Keen Boileau ſhall not want his proper praiſe.</q>
                  <p>Nicolas Boileau Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaux was born <hi>in</hi> or <hi>near</hi> Paris, for it is a conteſted point, on the firſt of November 1636, and died in March 1711 of a dropſy, the very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe which terminated the life of his Engliſh rival. The Lutrin of Boileau, ſtill conſidered by ſome French Critics of the preſent time as the beſt poem to which France has given birth, was firſt publiſhed in 1674. It is with great reaſon and juſtice that Voltaire confeſſes the Lutrin inferior to the Rape of the Lock. Few Poets can be ſo properly compared as Pope and Boileau; and, wherever their writings will admit of compariſon, we may, without any national partiality, adjudge the ſuperiority to the Engliſh Bard. Theſe two great authors reſembled each other as much in the integrity of their lives, as in the ſubjects and execution of their ſeveral compoſitions. There are two actions recorded of Boileau, which ſufficiently prove that the inexorable Satiriſt had a moſt generous and friendly heart; when Patru, the celebrated Advocate, who was ruined by his paſſion for literature, found himſelf under the painful neceſſity of ſelling his expenſive library, and had almoſt agreed to part with it for a moderate ſum, Boileau gave him a much ſuperior price; and, after paying the money, added this condition to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, that Patru ſhould retain, during his life, the poſſeſſion of the books. The ſucceeding inſtance of the Poet's generoſity is yet nobler:— when it was rumoured at court that the King intended to retrench the penſion of Corneille, Boileau haſtened to Madame de Monteſpan, and ſaid, that his Sovereign, equitable as he was, could not, without injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, grant a penſion to an author like himſelf, juſt aſcending Parnaſſus, and take it from Corneille, who had ſo long been ſeated on the ſummit; that he entreated her, for the honour of the King, to prevail on his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty rather to ſtrike off <hi>his</hi> penſion, than to withdraw that reward from a man whoſe title to it was incomparably greater; and that he ſhould more eaſily conſole himſelf under the loſs of that diſtinction, than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the affliction of ſeeing it taken away from ſuch a Poet as Corneille. This magnanimous application had the ſucceſs which it deſerved, and it
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0331500700:281"/>
appears the more noble, when we recollect that the rival of Corneille was the intimate friend of Boileau.</p>
                  <p>The long and unreſerved intercourſe which ſubſiſted between our Poet and Racine was highly beneficial and honourable to both. The dying farewell of the latter is the moſt expreſſive eulogy on the private character of Boileau: Je regarde comme un bonheur pour moi de mourir avant vous, ſaid the tender Racine, in taking a final leave of his faithful and generous friend.</p>

                  <p>Though the Henriade has been frequently reprinted, and the partizans of Voltaire have endeavoured to make it a national point of honour to ſupport its reputation, it ſeems at length to be ſinking under that neglect and oblivion, which never fail to overtake every feeble offspring of the Epic Muſe. Several of our moſt eminent Critics have attacked this performance with peculiar ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſome have condemned it on the moſt oppoſite principles, merely becauſe it does not coincide with their reſpective ſyſtems. Their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence has been paſſed only in ſhort and incidental remarks; but a French writer, inflamed by perſonal animoſity againſt Voltaire, has raiſed three octavo volumes on the defects of this ſingle poem. Mr. Clement, in his <hi>"Entretiens ſur le Poeme Epique relativement à la Henriade,"</hi> has endeavoured to prove it utterly deficient in all the eſſential points of Epic poetry;—in the ſtructure of its general plan, in the conduct of its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious parts, in ſentiment, in character, in ſtyle. His work indeed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays an acrimonious deteſtation of the Poet whom he examines; and perhaps there is hardly any human compoſition which could ſupport the ſcrutiny of ſo rigid an inquiſitor: the Henriade is utterly unequal to it; for in many articles we are obliged to confeſs, that the juſtice of the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic is not inferior to his ſeverity. He diſcovers, in his diſſection of the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0331500700:283"/>
Poem, the ſkill of an anatomiſt, with the malignity of an aſſaſſin. If any thing can deſerve ſuch rigorous treatment, it is certainly the artifice of Voltaire, who, in his Eſſay on Epic Poetry, has attempted, with much ingenuity, to ſink the reputation of all the great Epic Writers, that he might raiſe himſelf to their level; an attempt in which no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor can ultimately ſucceed; for, as D'Alembert has admirably remarked on a different occaſion, Le public laiſſera l'amour propre de chaque ecrivain faire ſon plaidoyer, rira de leurs efforts, non de genie, mais de raiſonnement, pour hauſſer leur place, et finira par mettre chacun à la ſienne.</p>

                  <q>And, ſhrouded in a miſt of moral ſpleen.]</q>
                  <p>It ſeems to be the peculiar infelicity of Pope, that his moral virtues have had a tendency to diminiſh his poetical reputation. Poſſeſſing a benevolent ſpirit, and wiſhing to make the art, to which he devoted his life, as ſerviceable as he could to the great intereſts of mankind, he ſoon quitted the higher regions of poetry, for the more level, and more frequented field of Ethics and of Satire. He declares, with a noble pride ariſing from the probity of his intention,
<q>
                        <l>That not in Fancy's maze he wander'd long,</l>
                        <l>But ſtoop'd to truth, and moraliz'd his ſong.</l>
                     </q>
The ſeverity of Criticiſm has from hence inferred, that his imagination was inferior to the other faculties of his mind, and that he poſſeſſed not that vigour of genius which might enable him to rank with our more ſublime and pathetic Bards. This inference appears to me extremely defective both in candour and in reaſon; it would ſurely be more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and I will venture to add, more juſt, to aſſign very different cauſes for his having latterly applied himſelf to moral and ſatyric compoſition. If his preceding poems diſplayed only a moderate portion of fancy and of tenderneſs, we might indeed very fairly conjecture, that he quitted the kind of poetry, where theſe qualities are particularly required, becauſe Nature directed him to ſhine only as the Poet of reaſon.—But his earlier productions will authorize an oppoſite concluſion. At an age when few authors have produced any capital work, Pope gave the world two poems;
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0331500700:284"/>
one the offspring of imagination, and the other of ſenſibility, which will ever ſtand at the head of the two poetical claſſes to which they belong: his Rape of the Lock, and his Eloiſe, have nothing to fear from any ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, either of paſt or of future time. When a writer has diſplayed ſuch early proofs of exquiſite fancy, and of tender enthuſiaſm, thoſe great conſtituents of the real Poet, ought we not to regret that he did not give a greater ſcope and freer exerciſe to theſe qualities, rather than to aſſert that he did not poſſeſs them in a ſuperlative degree? Why then, it may be aſked, did he confine himſelf to compoſitions in which theſe have little ſhare? The life and character of Pope will perfectly explain the reaſons, why he did not always follow the higher ſuggeſtions of his own natural genius. He had entertained an opinion, that by ſtooping to truth, and employing his talents on the vices and follies of the paſſing time, he ſhould be moſt able to benefit mankind. The idea was perhaps ill-founded, but his conduct in conſequence of it was certainly noble. Its effects however were moſt unhappy; for it took from him all his enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, and may injure, in ſome degree, his immortal reputation: by ſuffering his thoughts to dwell too much on knaves and fools, he fell into the ſplenetic deluſion, that the world is nothing but a compound of vice and folly; and from hence he has been reproached for ſuppoſing that all human merit was confined to himſelf, and to a few of his moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate correſpondents.</p>
                  <p>There was an amiable peculiarity in the character of Pope, which had great influence both on his conduct and compoſition—he embraced the ſentiments of thoſe he loved with a kind of ſuperſtitious regard; his imagination and his judgment were perpetually the dupes of an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate heart: it was this which led him, at the requeſt of his idol Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingbroke, to write a ſublime poem on metaphyſical ideas which he did not perfectly comprehend; it was this which urged him almoſt to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with Mr. Allen, in compliance with the caprices of a female friend; it was this which induced him, in the warmth of gratitude, to follow the abſurd hints of Warburton with all the blindneſs of infatuated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Whoever examines the life and writings of Pope with a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute and unprejudiced attention, will find that his excellencies, both as a Poet and a Man, were peculiarly his own; and that his failings were chiefly owing to the ill judgment, or the artifice, of his real and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0331500700:285"/>
friends. The laviſh applauſe and the advice of his favourite Atterbury, was perhaps the cauſe of his preſerving the famous character of Addiſon, which, finely written as it is, all the lovers of Pope muſt wiſh him to have ſuppreſſed. Few of his friends had integrity or frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſufficient to perſuade him, that his ſatires would, deſtroy the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of his life, and cloud the luſtre of his fame: yet, to the honour of Lyttelton, be it remembered, that he ſuggeſted ſuch ideas to the Poet, in the verſes which he wrote to him from Rome, with all the becoming zeal of enlightened friendſhip:

                  <p>This generous admonition did not indeed produce its intended effect, for other counſellors had given a different bias to the mind of the Poet, and the malignity of his enemies had exaſperated his temper; yet he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards turned his thoughts towards the compoſition of a national Epic poem, and poſſibly in conſequence of the hint which this Epiſtle of Lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telton contains. The intention was formed too late, for it aroſe in his decline of life. Had he poſſeſſed health and leiſure to execute ſuch a work, I am perſuaded it would have proved a glorious acquiſition to the literature of our country: the ſubject indeed which he had choſen muſt be allowed to have an unpromiſing appearance; but the opinion of Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon concerning his Sylphs, which was ſurely honeſt, and not invidious, may teach us hardly ever to decide againſt the intended works of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior genius. Yet in all the Arts, we are perpetually tempted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſuch deciſions. I have frequently condemned ſubjects which my friend Romney had ſelected for the pencil; but in the ſequel, my opinion only proved that I was near-ſighted in thoſe regions of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where his keener eyes commanded all the proſpect.</p>

                  <p>For the advice which I have thus ventured to give ſuch of my fair readers as have a talent for poetry, I ſhall produce them a much higher poetical authority. In the age of Petrarch, an Italian Lady, named Giuſtina Perrot, was deſirous of diſtinguiſhing herſelf by this pleaſing accompliſhment; but the remarks of the world, which repreſented it as improper for her ſex, diſcouraged her ſo far, that ſhe was almoſt tempted to relinquiſh her favourite pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. In her doubts on this point, ſhe conſulted the celebrated Poet of her country in an elegant Sonnet; and received his anſwer on the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting ſubject in the ſame poetical form. I ſhall add the two Sonnets, with an imitation of each.</p>

                  <p>Arioſto is ſaid to have been publicly crowned with laurel at Mantua, by the Emperor Charles the Vth, towards the end of the year 1532. This fact has been diſputed by various writers, but it ſeems to be ſufficiently eſtabliſhed by the reſearches of Mazzuchelli.</p>
                  <p>The cuſtom of crowning Poets with laurel is almoſt as ancient as poetry itſelf, ſays the Abbé du Reſnel, in his Recherches ſur les Poetes couron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nez, a work which contains but ſcanty information on this curious topic. Petrarch is generally ſuppoſed to have revived this ancient ſolemnity, which had been aboliſhed as a pagan inſtitution in the reign of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Theodoſius. It appears however, from two paſſages in the writings of Boccacio, that Dante had entertained ſerious thoughts of this honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtinction, which his exile precluded him from receiving, as he choſe, ſays his Biographer, to be crown'd only in his native city.</p>
                  <p>An amuſing volume might be written on the honours which have been paid to Poets in different ages, and in various parts of the world. It is remarkable, that the moſt unpoliſhed nations have been the moſt laviſh in rewarding their Bards. There are two inſtances on record, in which poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical talents have raiſed their poſſeſſors even to ſovereign dominion. The Scythians choſe the Poet Thamyris for their king, though he was not a native of their country, <gap reason="foreign">

From the four Latin verſes which the Hiſtorian has given us, as a

                  <q>For him her fountains guſh with golden ſtreams.]</q>
                  <p>Of the great wealth which flowed into the hands of this extraordinary Poet, his friend and biographer Montalvan has given a particular account. This author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that Lope de Vega gained by his dramatic works alone a ſum nearly equal to 20,000 pounds ſterling; the revenue ariſing from the poſts he held, and from his penſion, was very conſiderable. His opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was much encreaſed by the moſt ſplendid inſtances of private libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. He received many coſtly preſents from various characters to whom he was perſonally unknown; and he was himſelf heard to ſay, in ſpeaking of his generous patron, that the Duke of Seſſa alone had given him, at different periods of his life, ſums almoſt amounting to ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that the noble patrons of Engliſh poetry have not equalled this example of Spaniſh munificence, even if we admit, the truth of our traditionary anecdotes concerning the generoſity of Lord South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton to Shakeſpeare, and of Sir Philip Sidney to Spenſer. Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the liberality for which our nation is ſo juſtly celebrated, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that not a ſingle Engliſh Poet appears to have been enriched by our monarchs: yet Spenſer had every claim to the bounty of Elizabeth; he ſung her praiſes in a ſtrain which might gratify her pride; and of all who have flattered the great, he may juſtly be conſidered as the moſt worthy of reward. His ſong was the tribute of his heart as well as of his fancy, and the ſex of his idol may be ſaid to purify his incenſe from all the offenſive particles of ſervile adulation. The neglect which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced from the vain, imperious, and ungrateful Elizabeth, appears the more ſtriking, when we recollect, that her lovely rival, the beautiful and unfortunate Queen of Scots, ſignalized her ſuperior generoſity by a magnificent preſent of plate to the French Poet Ronſard. This neglected Bard was once the darling of France, and perhaps equalled Lope de Vega in the honours which he received: his ſovereign, Charles the Ninth, compoſed ſome elegant verſes in his praiſe, and the city of Toulouſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with a Minerva of maſſive ſilver.</p>

                  <p>It has been lately lamented by an elegant and accompliſhed writer, who had too much reaſon for the complaint, that

                  <q>THE looſe Petronius gave the maxim birth.]</q>
                  <p>Ariſtotle has ſaid but little, in his Poetics, concerning that weighty point, which has ſo much employed and embarraſſed the modern Critics—the machinery of the Epic poem; and the little which he has ſaid might rather furniſh an argument for its excluſion, than juſtify its uſe. But Rome, in her moſt degenerate days, produced a writer, to whoſe authority, contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible as it is, moſt frequent appeals have been made in this curious lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary queſtion. In almoſt every modern author who has touched, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſlightly, on Epic poetry, we may find at leaſt ſome part of the following ſentence from Petronius Arbiter:—Ecce, Belli civilis ingens opus quiſquis attigerit, niſi plenus litteris, ſub onere labetur. Non enim res geſtae verſibus comprehendendae ſunt, quod longe melius hiſtorici fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt; ſed per ambages, deorumque miniſteria, &amp; fabuloſum ſententi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum tormentum praecipitandus eſt liber ſpiritus; ut potius furentis animi vaticinatio appareat, quam religioſae orationis ſub teſtibus fides.</p>
                  <p>Theſe remarks on the neceſſity of celeſtial agents, were evidently, made to depreciate the Pharſalia of Lucan; and Petronius may be called a fair Critic, as Pope ſaid of Milbourne, on his oppoſition to Dryden, becauſe he produces his own poetry in contraſt to that which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns. His ſpecimen of the manner in which he thought an Epic poem ſhould be conducted, ſufficiently proves the abſurdity of his cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm;
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0331500700:293"/>
for how inſipid is the fable in thoſe verſes which he has oppoſed to the Pharſalia, when compared to the firſt book of Lucan! Yet the Epic compoſition of Petronius has not wanted admirers: a Dutch Commentator is bold enough to ſay, that he prefers this ſingle rhapſody to three hundred volumes of ſuch poetry as Lucan's: an opinion which can only lead us to exclaim with Boileau,
<q>Un ſot trouve toujours un plus ſot qui l'admire.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If men of letters, in the age of Lucan, differed in their ſentiments concerning machinery, the great changes that have ſince happened in the world, and the diſquiſitions which have appeared on the ſubject, are very far from having reconciled the judgment of modern writers on this important article. Two eminent Critics of the preſent time have delivered opinions on this topic ſo ſingularly oppoſite to each other, that I ſhall tranſcribe them both.</p>
                  <q>In a theatrical entertainment, which employs both the eye and the ear, it would be a groſs abſurdity to introduce upon the ſtage ſuperior Beings in a viſible ſhape. There is not place for ſuch objection in an Epic poem; and Boileau, with many other Critics, declares ſtrongly for that fort of machinery in an Epic poem. But waving authority, which is apt to impoſe upon the judgment, let us draw what light we can from reaſon. I begin with a preliminary remark, that this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is but indiſtinctly handled by Critics, The poetical privilege of animating inſenſible objects for enlivening a deſcription, is very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from what is termed <hi>machinery,</hi> where deities, angels, devils, or other ſupernatural powers, are introduced as real perſonages, mixing in the action, and contributing to the cataſtrophe; and yet theſe two things are conſtantly jumbled together in the reaſoning. The former is founded on a natural principle; but can the latter claim the ſame authority? So far from it, that nothing is more unnatural. Its effects at the ſame time are deplorable. Firſt, it gives an air of fiction to the whole, and prevents that impreſſion of reality which is requiſite to intereſt our affections, and to move our paſſions; which of itſelf is ſufficient to explode machinery, whatever entertainment it may afford to readers of a fantaſtic taſte or irregular imagination.
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0331500700:294"/>
And next, were it poſſible, by diſguiſing the fiction, to delude us into a notion of reality, which I think can hardly be, an inſuperable objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would ſtill remain, which is, that the aim or end of an Epic poem can never be attained in any perfection where machinery is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced; for an evident reaſon, that virtuous emotions cannot be raiſed ſucceſsfully, but by the actions of thoſe who are endued with paſſions and affections like our own, that is, by human actions: and as for moral inſtruction, it is clear that none can be drawn from Beings who act not upon the ſame principles with us. Homer, it is true, introduces the Gods into his fable; but the religion of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try authorized that liberty; it being an article in the Grecian creed, that the Gods often interpoſe viſibly and bodily in human affairs. I muſt, however, obſerve, that Homer's Deities do no honour to his poems. Fictions that tranſgreſs the bounds of nature ſeldom have a good effect; they may inflame the imagination for a moment, but will not be reliſhed by any perſon of a correct taſte. They may be of ſome uſe to the lower rank of writers; but an author of genius has much finer materials of nature's production for elevating his ſubject, and making it intereſting.—Voltaire, in his Eſſay upon Epic Poetry, talking of the Pharſalia, obſerves judiciouſly, that the proximity of time, the notoriety of events, the character of the age, enlightened and Political, joined with the ſolidity of Lucan's ſubject, deprived him of all liberty of poetical fiction. Is it not amazing, that a Critic who reaſons ſo juſtly with reſpect to others, can be ſo blind with reſpect to himſelf? Voltaire, not ſatisfied to enrich his language with images drawn from inviſible and ſuperior Beings, introduces them into the action. In the ſixth canto of the Henriade, St. Louis appears in perſon, and terrifies the ſoldiers; in the ſeventh canto, St. Louis ſends the God of Sleep to Henry; and in the tenth, the demons of Diſcord, Fanaticiſm, War, &amp;c. aſſiſt Aumale in a ſingle combat with Turenne, and are driven away by a good angel brandiſhing the ſword of God. To blend ſuch fictitious perſonages in the ſame action with. mortals, makes a bad figure at any rate, and is intolerable in a hiſtory ſo recent as that of Henry IV.

                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:0331500700:295"/>The Pagan Gods and Gothic Fairies were equally out of credit when Milton wrote. He did well therefore to ſupply their room with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Devils. If theſe too ſhould wear out of the popular creed (and they ſeem in a hopeful way, from the liberty ſome late Critics have taken with them) I know not what other expedients the Epic Poet might have recourſe to; but this I know—the pomp of verſe, the energy of deſcription, and even the fineſt moral paintings, would ſtand him in no ſtead. Without <hi>admiration</hi> (which cannot be effected but by the marvellous of celeſtial intervention, I mean the agency of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior natures really exiſting, or by the illuſion of the fancy taken to be ſo) no Epic poem can be long-lived. I am not afraid to inſtance in the Henriade itſelf, which, notwithſtanding the elegance of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, will in a ſhort time be no more read than the Gondibert of Sir W. Davenant, and for the ſame reaſon.

                  <p>I have thus ventured to confront theſe eminent critical antagoniſts, that, while they engage and overthrow each other, we may obſerve the injuſtice produced by the ſpirit of ſyſtematical criticiſm, even in authors moſt reſpectable for their talents and erudition.—Here is the unfortunate Voltaire placed between two critical fires, which equally deſtroy him. The <hi>firſt</hi> Critic aſſerts that the Henriade muſt be ſhort-lived, becauſe the Poet <hi>has introduced inviſible and ſuperior agents</hi>;—the <hi>ſecond</hi> denounces the ſame fate againſt it, becauſe <hi>it wants</hi> the <hi>agency of ſuperior natures:</hi> yet ſurely every reader of poetry, who is not influenced by any particular ſyſtem, will readily allow, that if Voltaire had treated his ſubject with true Epic ſpirit in all other points, neither the introduction nor the abſence of St. Louis could be ſingly ſufficient to plunge the Henriade in oblivion. Indeed the learned author, who has ſpoken in ſo peremptory a manner concerning the neceſſity of ſupernatural agents to preſerve the exiſtence of an Epic poem, appears rather unfortunate in the two exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by which he endeavours to ſupport his doctrine; for the Epic poems both of Davenant and Voltaire have ſufficient defects to account for any neglect which may be their lot, without conſidering the article of Machinery.</p>
                  <p>If I have warmly oppoſed any deciſions of this exalted Critic, it is
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0331500700:296"/>
from a perſuaſion (in which I may perhaps be miſtaken) that <hi>ſome</hi> of his maxims have a ſtrong tendency to injure an art highly dear to us both; an art on which his genius and learning have caſt <hi>many</hi> rays of pleaſing and of uſeful light.</p>

                  <p>The Indian mythology, as it has lately been illuſtrated in the writings of Mr. Holwell, is finely calculated to anſwer the purpoſe of any poetical genius who may wiſh to introduce new machinery into the ſerious Epic Poem. Beſides the powerful charm of novelty, it would have the advantage of not claſhing with our national religion; for the endeavours of Mr. Holwell to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the ancient and pure doctrine of Bramah with the diſpenſation of Chriſt, have ſo far ſucceeded, that if his ſyſtem does not ſatisfy a theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſt, it certainly affords a ſufficient baſis for the ſtructure of a Poet. In peruſing his account of the Indian ſcripture, every reader of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may, I think, perceive, that the Shaſtah might ſupply a poetical ſpirit with as rich a maſs of ideal treaſure as fancy could with to work upon.—An Epic Poet, deſirous of laying the ſcene of his action in India, would be more embarraſſed to find intereſting Heroes than proper Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. —Had juſtice and generoſity inſpired and guided that Engliſh valour, which has ſignalized itſelf on the plains of Indoſtan; had the arms of our country been employed to deliver the native Indians from the oppreſſive uſurpation of the Mahometan powers; ſuch exploits would preſent to the Epic Muſe a ſubject truly noble, and the mytholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Eaſt might enrich it with the moſt ſplendid decorations. Whether it be poſſible or not to find ſuch a ſubject in the records of our Indian hiſtory, I leave the reader to determine.—Our great Hiſtorian of the Roman empire has intimated, in a note to the firſt volume of his immortal work, that
<q>the wonderful expedition of Odin, which deduces
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0331500700:297"/>
the enmity of the Goths and Romans from ſo memorable a cauſe, might ſupply the noble ground-work of an Epic poem.</q>
The idea is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly both juſt and ſplendid. Had Gray been ever tempted to engage in ſuch a work, he would probably have convinced us, that the Northern mythology has ſtill ſufficient power to ſeize and enchant the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as much in Epic as in Lyric compoſition.</p>
                  <p>It may amuſe our ſpeculative Critics, to conſider how far the <hi>religious Gothic fables</hi> ſhould be introduced or rejected, to render ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance moſt intereſting to a modern reader. Few judges would agree in their ſentiments on the queſtion; and perhaps the great diſpute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Machinery cannot be fairly adjuſted, till ſome happy genius ſhall poſſeſs ambition and perſeverance enough to execute two Epic poems, in the one adopting, and in the other rejecting, ſupernatural agents; for Reaſon alone is by no means an infallible conductor in the province of Fancy; and in the poetical as well as the philoſophical world, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the ſureſt guide to truth.</p>
