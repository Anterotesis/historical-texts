            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IN this little</hi> Collection <hi>of</hi> POEMS, all <hi>those signed</hi> ANNA MATILDA, <hi>except the</hi> REPLY <hi>to</hi> REUBEN, <hi>have been before the Public. Desirous to have her name united with that of</hi> DELLA CRUSCA<hi>'s, longer than the fleeting fame of News<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers allows,</hi> ANNA MATILDA <hi>had begun to recall some fugitive trifles, in order to form them into a volume—when she saw the Poetry of</hi> DELLA CRUSCA, <hi>&amp;c. advertised by</hi> Mr. Bell. <hi>This did not induce her to change her</hi> design, <hi>only the</hi> mode <hi>of it; and still wishing to be united with her favourite bard in a distinct publication, she offered his publisher her Poems, on condition of their being form'd into a volume, similar to his—the offer was accepted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not having, however, Poetry enough to form such a volume, she was persuaded to enrich it with some curious</hi> PROSE<hi>—written</hi> "in other times." <hi>The Fragment subjoined to the Poems, is from the</hi> autograph <hi>of the famous</hi> Sir William Waller; <hi>an important Actor in the busy drama of the last</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:0516400600:4"/>
               <hi>century. The manuscript has been preserved in a family to which its Editor is allied, and who are pleased at an opportunity of making their treasure public; how then can</hi> ANNA MATILDA <hi>fear for her</hi> poetic existence, <hi>when it is protected on the one hand by the best Lyric of the</hi> present age, <hi>and on the other by one of the most pious men, and greatest Warriors of the last?</hi>

               <l>THIS wild chaotic mass of every dye,</l>
               <l>Where principles of beauteous <hi>order</hi> lie,</l>
               <l>Is sure an emblem of the scene,</l>
               <l>When out of dark confusion sprung</l>
               <l>The variegated orb terrene,</l>
               <l>And in the solar system hung.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Soon as the mighty artist gives the sign,</l>
               <l>This formless mass, as at the word divine,</l>
               <l>Shall regulate its shade and light,</l>
               <l>Harmonious move as he shall will—</l>
               <l>Its tints divide, or else unite,</l>
               <l>Obedient to his powerful skill.</l>

               <l>Shall into prospects vast expand—</l>

               <l>Then stretch their velvet into land,</l>
               <l>Then bid their radiance stream—in skies.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In cumbrous Alps ascend, whose tops explore</l>
               <l>Regions, where day-ey'd eagles fear to soar;</l>
               <l>Or in the soft jonquil unfold,</l>
               <l>Midst the low beauties of the vale,</l>
               <l>Her robe of imitative gold,</l>
               <l>Which loads with sweets the dancing gale.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In distant forests spread th' inviting brown,</l>
               <l>Or hide, with spikey furze, the barren down—</l>
               <l>Then, tumbling from the flinty rock,</l>
               <l>In white meanders lead the eye;</l>
               <l>And then the eye's keen search to mock</l>
               <l>Thro' some time-fretted cavern fly.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Richly festoon'd in luscious purple shine,</l>
               <l>Extending o'er the slope the nect'rous vine,</l>
               <l>Or in the gaudy spheroids swell,</l>
               <l>Which the swart Indian's groves illume,</l>
               <l>Or dye the spicey nonpareil,</l>
               <l>Or the soft peach's stain assume.</l>

               <l>Here springs a HEBE, there a SAGE,</l>
               <l>Here HEROES from the mass break forth,</l>

               <l>Charles rub'd his cheek, and thus replied,</l>

            <p>[In the following Correspondence, which has occasioned much notice, it has been suggested that there has been some collusion;—ANNA MATILDA, therefore, declares that tho' she has lately guessed at DELLA CRUSCA, she is yet uncertain as to his name and rank, and she is persuaded that he cannot have the most dis tantidea of her's.</p>
            <p>The beautiful lines of the ADIEU AND RECALL struck her so forcibly, that without rising from the table at which she read, she answered them. DELLA CRUSCA's elegant Reply surprised her into another, and thus the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence most unexpectedly became settled, ANNA MATILDA's share in it has little to boast; but she has one claim of which she is proud—That of having been the first to point out the excellence of Della Crusca; if there can be merit in discerning what is so very obvious.]</p>

               <l>THOU bidst!—"<hi>my purple slumbers fly</hi>"</l>
               <l>Day's radiance pours upon my eye.</l>
               <l>I wake—I live! the sense o'erpays</l>
               <l>The trivial griefs of early days.</l>
               <l>What! tho' the rose-bud on my cheek</l>
               <l>Hath shed its leaves, which late so sleek,</l>
               <l>Spoke youth, and joy—and careless thought,</l>
               <l>By guilt, or fear, or shame un-smote,</l>
               <l>My <hi>blooming soul</hi> is yet in youth,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O! I can wander yet, and taste</l>
               <l>The beauties of the flow'ry waste;</l>
               <l>The nightingale's deep swell can feel,</l>
               <l>Whilst from my lids the soft drops steal;</l>
               <l>Rapt! gaze upon the gem-deck'd night,</l>
               <l>And mark the clear moon's silent flight;</l>

               <l>Yes, the time was, nor very far the date,</l>

               <l>Whilst their red leaves fall flutt'ring to their grave,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Well have I left the air-embosom'd hills,</l>
               <l>Where sprightly Health in verdant buskin plays;</l>
               <l>Forsaken fallow meads, and circling mills,</l>
               <l>And thyme-dress'd heaths, where the soft flock yet strays.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>Whose heroes bled superior to their pain,</l>

               <l>The bursting sod its palid inmate yields,</l>

               <l>ON the sea-shore with folded arms I stood,</l>
               <l>The Sun, just sinking, shot a level ray,</l>
               <l>Luxuriant crimson glow'd upon the flood,</l>
               <l>And the curl'd surf was ting'd with golden spray.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Far of I faintly track'd the feath'ry sail;</l>
               <l>When thy sweet numbers caught my yielded ear,</l>
               <l>Borne on the bosom of the flutt'ring gale,</l>
               <l>They struck my heart—and rous'd me to a tear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet flow'd no bitter anguish from mine eye,</l>
               <l>A while remembrance left my wayward state;</l>
               <l>And the soft cadence of thy warbled sigh,</l>
               <l>Pour'd healing balm into the wounds of Fate.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What tho' grim Winter's desolating frown,</l>
               <l>The wild waves uproar when rough <hi>Eurus</hi> blows,</l>

               <l>Lur'd by its light, his fancy may aspire,</l>

               <l>Vain in the morn of life, and thoughtless too,</l>
               <l>He rush'd impetuous as strong passion drove,</l>
               <l>But soon each flatt'ring prospect fled his view,</l>
               <l>Deceived by Friendship much, but more by Love.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yes, he has lov'd to Transport's dire excess,</l>

               <l>Has felt the female voice each pulse oppress,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But why recall the moments that are fled?</l>
               <l>For ever fled, like yonder sweeping blast;</l>
               <l>With Love, each active principle is dead,</l>
               <l>And all, except its sad regret, is past.</l>

            <p>The following was not composed, from an idea that enough had not been said on the subject of INDIFFERENCE,—it was hastily written, merely to let DELLA CRUSCA know that he was GUESS'D AT;—but the line which would to him have particularly pointed that out, was, when given in The WORLD, alter'd—it is now printed as originally written. For its many careless passages ANNA MATILDA begs this apology may be accepted, that she wrote it literally whilst sitting for her portrait;—and whilst the sublimity of Egyptian groves, Zenobia's desart, Confucious, Marc Antony, &amp;c. &amp;c. had their ideas continually broken in upon, with "SMILE A LITTLE;"—"MORE TO THE RIGHT;" "NOW LOOK UP," and so forth. Both the poetry and the painting have suffer'd for this—the one has been less happy, the other less correct.</p>

               <head>ANNA MATILDA,</head>
               <head>TO THOSE WHO READ.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE following little Tract, printed care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully from the Manuscript of the once famous</hi> Sir William Waller, <hi>is considered as a curiosity wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of being given to the public:—It contains the</hi> memoranda <hi>and</hi> reflections <hi>of a man who had a considerable share in forming the fate of England, at a time when the strong convulsions of its state arrested the attention of Europe, and of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir William Waller <hi>was a member of the House of Commons, and Major-General of the Parliament army. It appears from</hi> WHITLOCK, <hi>that he was a man of great consideration in the army, and with the public.</hi> Oliver Cromwell <hi>served under him—the</hi> KING <hi>feared him—the</hi> PARLIAMENT <hi>depended on him.</hi>

                     </gap> sufficiently establish;—it is a</hi> mental mirror, <hi>in which you behold the features of the writer's mind, as distinctly as a looking glass reflects, to a young beauty, her cheek of roses, and her eye of fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he was popular as to courage and resolution, is plain from a formal petition sent to Parliament by the inhabitants of Portsmouth, praying that</hi> Sir William Waller <hi>might be made their Governor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he had a mind capable of the tenderest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, and alive to all the charms of love, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, from this, that he never lived unmarried. Three times he exulted in the flowery hymeneal chain; and speaks of each Lady with exalted fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and affection. But those, alas! were days in which the</hi> connubial passion <hi>was the only one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of</hi> WALLER, Hume <hi>begins to speak in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words:—</hi>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>In the year</hi> 1643, Sir William Waller <hi>began to distinguish himself among the Generals of the army. Active, and indeſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable; in his operations rapid and enterprising; he was fitted by his genius to the nature of war.</hi>"</q> Vol. VI. p. 516.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0516400600:103"/>
                  <hi>It has been lately so much the taste to read the ana of celebrated men, that the Editor of</hi> these <hi>is persuaded, their being combined with the effusions of her own idle hours, will not render them unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. To the public, perhaps, there is no occasion for apology, but towards the writer himself, she has some consciousness of delinquency. The brave General, who wore himself out in campaigns, cased in armour, and peeping half his life through an iron vizor, thought of nothing</hi> less, <hi>probably, than of turning author;—yet it happens, that after he has been at rest with his tumultuous ancestors (I hope they will forgive my guessing at their characters) almost a century, and his military and moral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter long ago decided on, he is now made to hold up his hand at the literary bar, to be tried by his Critics, and his Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To his critics and countrymen, it may be observed, that if they have an appetite for anecdote, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing pages will not tend much to satisfy it. They are filled with the recollections of a man, who, at the close of a busy life, thought it</hi> time <hi>to recollect himself, and who recollects</hi> only <hi>about himself. In the retrospect, his imminent dangers, and hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breadth 'scapes, light up his gratitude to Heaven, and make his little book rather a compendium of piety, than a register of events. A piety not much</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0516400600:104"/>
                  <hi>differing from that which has provoked our sneers at the posthumous works of the great</hi> Johnson;<hi>—but then,</hi> he <hi>was a scholar, and a philosopher, and his piety, in course, very much unlike other people's. What you are now offer'd, is the piety of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral—we have many Generals, and they can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for the similitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In a word—this peculiar little volume is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented not to the world as an amusement, but to the</hi> curious <hi>as a</hi> medal. <hi>A medal struck at an era when the events of this country were</hi> MIGHTY, <hi>and when the characters of men were</hi> GRAND: <hi>when every action was on an enlarged scale, and in high relief;—when the kingdom, like Sir Joshua's infant Hercules, was struggling between the two deadly serpents which assailed its vitality—the</hi> TY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RANNY OF THE COMMONWEALTH, <hi>and the</hi> PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROGATIVE OF THE CROWN.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> internal evidence <hi>the book carries with it is so strong, that it is judged not necessary to say one word on its authenticity. But it is necessary to say, that besides the pages suppressed (mentioned in the conclusion), there has been an elision of one entire section, under the head</hi> OF PERILS BY WATER; <hi>a part likewise of that under the head</hi> BY GREAT SICKNESSES, <hi>has been cut out, because the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0516400600:105"/>
                  <hi>mentioned, and the terms used, are not exactly correspondent to the ideas of delicacy, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, is in this age one of its characteristics.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the opening of the manuscript, there appears to be two leaves wanting; whether what is lost contained events or reflections, it is impossible to judge—the leaves are not torn, but cut out care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with a knife, close to the margin. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the third leaf, is the end of a reflection, of which</hi> itt, <hi>is the first word. For further information the reader shall be now left to Sir William himself, and it is hoped he will not rank the half hour spent in his society, amongst the most unprofitable half hours of his life.</hi>

               <p>Seissed upon by the army, as I was going to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my duty in the House of Commons, and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to priviledg of Parliament, made a prisoner in the Queen's court; from thence carried ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously to a place under the Exchequer called Hell, and the next day to the King's Head in the Strand; after, singled out (as a sheep to the slaughter) and removed to St. James's: thence sent to Windsor Castle, and remanded to St. James's againe; lastly tossed, like a ball into a strange country, to Denbigh Castle in North Wales, remote from, my relations and interests.—After above three yeares imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thus being changed as itt were from ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to vessel, itt pleased the Lord to turne my capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and to restore me to the comforts of my poore family againe; and here let me call to mind how much reason I had to be thankfull to him, who chasteneth those whom he loveth, for the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation experienced in the dear partner of my cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. She came to me disguised in mean apparell,

when I had groaned in my bonds seven months, thinking itt the duty of a wife, to riske all things for the satisfaction of her husband. Much difficulty had she in comming, and was frequent on the brink of being discovered; but att length over moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and unknown roads, sometimes with a guide, and sometimes with none, she arrived att my prison: and she seemed when she discovered her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to me, to be like the Angell who appeared unto Peter in like circumstances: she did not indeed bid my prison gates fly open, but by her sweet converse and behaviour, she made those things seem light, which were before heavy, and scarce to be borne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—I must ever acknowledg itt also a very great mercy, that being so long subject to so great a <hi>malice,</hi> armed with so great a <hi>power,</hi> I was not given as a prey to their teeth; and that after all the indeavours that were used to finde out matter of charge against me, I came off with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire innocency, not only uncondemned, but unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused.</p>
               <p>The 5th of August, 1659, I was seized a priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by a party of horse in Kent, and the 22d fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing I was committed to the Tower, only upon jealousy; and, because I refused to inform the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell further than in what singly concerned my self, and because I denyed to give any ingagement.

31st of October following, the Lord delivered me by my habeas corpus in an open cleare way, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all opposition. Blessed be his holy name who hath been my constant keeper, and hath not only delivered me out of the mouth of the lion (as he did Paul) but preserved me in itt. And my trust is, the Lord shall deliver me from every evill worke, and will preserve me unto his heavenly Kingdome, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
               <p>2. IN DEATHS OFT;</p>
               <p>1. By suddain accidents.</p>
               <p>In my infancy, when I lay in my cradle, I escaped a great danger, upon the casuall discharge of a peece, the shott whereof missed me very narrowly.</p>
               <p>At Winchester Castle, I ran a great hassard of being buried under the ruines of an ould outwall, which I had been viewing, and considering how to have it taken down, and I was no sooner stept into the house (not above an easy stone's cast off) but itt fell, and covered all the place where I had been, and diverse yards beyond itt. My deare wife (the Lady Ann) had a deliverance of the very same kinde there likewise; having been to look att an ould staircase which was repairing, she was no sooner gon, but the place where she stood fell, and
<pb facs="tcp:0516400600:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:0516400600:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0516400600:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in humane reason, she could not but have perished in the ruines.—</p>
               <p>Att Cropredy in Oxfordshire, I escaped a great danger of the like nature, when being with my offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers att a councell of warr, the floore of the roome (where I was) sunke under me, and I lay over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with a great deal of lumber that fell upon me, and yet, blessed be God, I had no hurt att all. And att this place I did likewise escape a snare. After the battell, a message was sent to me by the King; when I had given my answer <hi>that I could not treat with his Majesty but by command of Parliament,</hi> I turned shortly round; when the trumpet said he had a <hi>private</hi> mesage for me, and praied me to hear him: I replyed there need be no privacy, not caring to give an handle to mine Enemies: but some that were neare me did persuade me to heare the man, and went out. He then presently pulled forth a letter, which to my great shame and surprise came from the Lady ******; in itt she besought me to betray my cause; and this she did so wittily and kinde, that I had much ado to be angry. Before this lady's marriage I had been her suitor, and did dearly love her, and she remembered me of this, and of some soft passages. Whether or not she was putt on this by some greater than herself, I never knew; but I returned for answer, that as I had
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0516400600:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
never been traitor to my love, so would I not to my cause, which I should be, if I did as she would advise, and after this I heard no more.—</p>
               <p>2. BY GREAT SICKNESSES.—</p>
               <p>I had a great deliverance from the plague att my house in Aldersgate-street, a chambermaid of my wifes being struck with itt (who died within a day or two after att the pesthouse, whither she was removed) my wife being then great with child (of my son Thomas) had her by the hand in her sickness, and was neare her, when she was in sweats, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she nor any of my family, were infected.</p>
               <p>Att Calais I escaped the plague, when Sir Philip Stapleton died of itt, and I was with him and had him by the hand, not above five or six howers before he departed.</p>
               <p>3. BY HASSARDS IN WARR.</p>
               <p>In the warrs between the Venetians, and the Archduke Ferdinand (afterwards Emperour) att the leaguer before Rubia, I escaped severall very neere shott; one grazing att my foot, another light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between Sir John Vere and me, as we sate close together by the battery; and yet touched neither
<pb facs="tcp:0516400600:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0516400600:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of us, besides diverse others, both great and small shott that indangered me.</p>
               <p>In the warr between the Emperour Ferdinand, and the King of Bohemia, I escaped miraculously out of the hands of the Cossacks, when in a skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish my horse was killed under me, and in the clearing of myself from him, I fell with my foot hanging in the stirrup, I was incompassed by them, and in making my way through them to my own men, had severall shott made att me, att a close dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet itt pleased the Lord, none wounded; only one grazed lightly on the topp of my head, and I came off with safety.</p>
               <p>Att the battell of Edghill, I had my horse shott under me, but I was preserved from any hurt.</p>
               <p>Att the taking of Farnham Castle, I escaped a very neare shott, from one of mine own men, as he followed me in a narrow passage, after I was entred.</p>
               <p>In my retreat from Chepstow, when Prince Maurice had lined all the passages between that and Glouces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with a very considerable army, to intercept me; I had no way left, but to transport my foote and traine of Artillery cross the Severn to Barkley Castle (from whence they were secured) and with
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0516400600:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my horse and dragoones to beat thro' his quarters; upon the march that night thorough the Forrest of Dean; itt happened thorough the sleepiness of an officer, that the maine body was separated a great distance from the fore troop (with which I marched) so that I was faine to make an halt for above halfe an hower, within litle more than a mile of the princes head quarter, in broad day light, the alarme taken, and not one hundred and twenty horse with me. Nevertheless itt pleased God in his infinit mercy to direct the rest of my troopes to me, and under the conduct of his providence, I made a safe and an honorable retreat to Gloucester, in despight of the enemy who charged me in the reare, but with more loss to him, than to me.</p>
               <p>Att Landsdown, when I made the retreat, I es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped a shower of shott.</p>
               <p>At the Devises, when I beat the Lord Marquess Harford, Prince Maurice, and the Lord Hopton, with their remaining forces into the town, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond night after I sat down before itt, having been out to visit the gardes, and returning to a farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house (at the foot of Roundway Down) where I had given order to my cooke, that my supper should be ready against I came in, and finding my meat but newly laid to the fire; in a suddain impatience I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
<pb facs="tcp:0516400600:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0516400600:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not to supp att all, and so tooke horse again, and rode upp to the topp, where the body of my horse lay. I was not gon above a muskett shott, but some of the ennemy (knowing the pasages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, which I did not; and rationally supposing I might quarter in that place; in regard of the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient situation of itt, between my horse and my foot) came into the house and enquired, and made a search for me, and if I had staied there (as at first I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) in all probability they might have suddainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched me, and retired in the darkness of night, with safety enough.</p>
               <p>Some dayes after, whilst I lay before the town, I rode with a small party about the quarters, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to see how the dragoones were laid, on the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side of the town; and being to returne back, itt pleased God to putt itt suddainly into my minde, to go by another way than that I came, which some of the party, and some of mine own servants (who staid a little behind) not observing, but taking the former way, they were almost all taken by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. I came back safely.</p>
               <p>Att Farnham God appeared wonderfully for me, when the Lord Hopton, drew upp his whole army within culverin shott of me, being (with the forces of Sir Jacob Ashly, who was then joined to him)
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0516400600:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
att the least eight thousand horse and foot; and (thorough the mistake or neglect of my adiutant-generall, and the slackness of my men, in drawing to the rendevous) I was not able to face him with two thousand men. In that extremity the Lord tooke opportunity to shew himself for me, and sent so thick a mist all the morning, that by reason of the darkness the ennemy durst not give on, and when the mist brake upp, I had such an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the ground, that my weakness re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained undiscovered, and he drew off from me, I was that day delivred from an imminent destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Att Cheriton Field, I was in danger to have been taken or killed, the ennemy having by a charge given upon some troopes of mine, shutt me off from mine own men, I having then but three with me; but itt pleased God they were repulsed againe, and thereby a way opened for my retreat.</p>
               <p>I may reckon itt a mercy, that upon a suddain oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion that day, charging without my headpeece, and being known by the ennemy (as I afterwards understood) I came off safe and unhurt.</p>
               <p>When the King came suddainly upon me with his whole army att Andover, and I had then nothing
<pb facs="tcp:0516400600:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0516400600:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but a body of horse and dragoones with me, I made a fair retreat to Basingstoke.</p>
               <p>Att the second Newbery fight, when I fell on with my troopes by the way off Speenfield, and wee were mingled with the ennemy, I had a great deliverence, for one of the adverse party coming behinde me, and being ready to fire his pistoll in my reines; in that instant one of my life guard killed him, or otherwise in all probability he had killed me.</p>

               <p>IN JOURNYINGS OFT.</p>
               <p>In my travell between Venice and Florence, I es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the danger of the Inquisition att Bolonia, where through the information of a priest (that came along in company with me from Venice) I was searched, my trunke, wherein I had nothing but clothes, was rifled to the bottome, but itt pleased God to so order itt, that they lett alone a box, wherein I had some papers, which might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0516400600:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
me to question; when they had itt in their hands ready to open itt.</p>
               <p>In my journey into Yorkeshire, to my Sisters house at Hickleton, (being accompanied with my wife the Lady Ann, and my dear mother) I reckon itt a great deliverance, that when my coach mares, upon the descent of an hill, had broken their raines, and overthrown the coachman from the box, and begun to run away, the raines falling down upon the ground, one of the mares, treading upon them, they checked her bitt, and made her stopp, which made the rest stand like-wise.</p>
               <p>IN PERILLS IN THE CITTY.</p>
               <p>When the army first marcht up to the citty of London, and made that breach upon the Parliament, I was voted to command a body of horse and dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goones, in the nature of a flying army, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the King, Kingdome, Parliament, and Citty; and whilst I was acting (with others) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my duty, at the Committee of Militia, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance that levy; wee were all unexpectedly deserted and betraied by the citty and left out of all capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; so that upon the entring of the army, we were
<pb facs="tcp:0516400600:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:0516400600:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>

inforced to lye hidd, and within a few dayes after to make use of the passes which the House of Commons had given us, and to quit the kingdome. The Lord all that time preserved me from falling into the hands of the army, though I was pursued by land and sea.</p>
               <p>When after the death of my late deare wife, I had sent out my sons to schoole, and removed my daughters, with some part of my goods, to the Lady Blanyes house in Long Acre (myself remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that desolate condition, a prisoner att St. James's) there was a base information given to the Councell of State, by a servant of mine (whome for a falsness I had putt away) that I had deposited plate and jewells, to a great vallue, in that good Ladyes custody; whereupon (without any cause alledged, or any thing att all in charge against me) they sent a warrant signed Bradshaw, by a sargeant att armes, to seize upon all thatt I had there, as belonging to an ennemy of the State. But itt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the wisdome of God to befoole their malice, that they made no search in mine own house, where all that I had of vallue was, but only in that place, where there was nothing but so incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable a parcell of plate, that they were asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0516400600:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to keep itt, when they had itt; and so they sent itt back again. In the mean time I had leasure to dispose of what I had by me, to a place of safety.</p>
               <p>March 22d, 1657. I was seized upon as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner by a warrant from the Protector, and brought to Whitehall, where I was examined by him. He did examin me as a stranger, not as one whome he had aforetime known, and obeyed; yet was he not discourteous, and itt pleased the Lord to preserve me, that not one thing objected could be prooved against me; so I was delivered, and returned with comfort to my family againe; blessed be the Name of the Lord!</p>
               <p>IN PERILS AMONG FALSE BRETHREN.</p>
               <p>It pleased the House of Commons to command my service, in taking care for the drawing upp for the Ordinance in favour of the Apprentices; upon which account some Apprentices (who negotiated that business for the rest) made their application to me; shortly after, when that petition from the citty was to be presented, which was followed with so much confusion, that it gave occasion, or pretence to the speaker, and diverse others of the House to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
<pb facs="tcp:0516400600:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0516400600:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the army; myself and the rest of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven members, having then gained the leave of the House, to absent ourselves, for six months (by that denial of our own right and priviledg, to preserve (if possible) the priviledg of Parliament from any further violation by the army) some two dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the presentation of the above said petition, there came two persons to my house in Drury Lane, to speak with me, who, when I came out unto them, tould me they were apprentices of the Citty, and came to be advised by me, how they should manage their petition; to whom I replyd, that I knew no advice to be given, but that they should be carefull to attend the House as early as they could, before they were praeingaged in other busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: but this did not serve their purpose, who came only to ensnare me; whereupon they moved further, and said, that myself and the other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached gentlemen were concerned in their petition, and that they must and would have us into the House againe. To which I returned no more, but that I should have no more to do in that business, and so I left them. This was all that passed, and yet those false impudent creatures made their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port att the army, that I abetted that disorder and assault upon the House, and cooperated with the apprentices in itt, which served to exasperate the army so much the more against me. But it pleased
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0516400600:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Lord that they never had power to act any thing upon itt to my prejudice.</p>
               <p>After I was made a prisoner by the army, and removed from the King's Head in the Strand to St. James, I had a message sent me from one Colonell Fitz-James with the signification of his respect to me, and compassion of me, representing the extreme danger in which I was, and the enevitable destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that attended me, if I did not endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent itt by some escape; in order to that, he made me a tender of his assistance, ingaging himself, that he would sett me safe aboard a shipp, that lay ready in the river for me to transport me beyond the reach of all mine ennemies. But itt pleased God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the effect of his treachery, both by giving me the confidence to stand upon mine own innocency, and by discovering to me, that that perfidious man (in the middest of all his protestations of friendshipp to me), had privately offered himself to give evidence against me att the barr of the House of Commons; so that it was a meere train, laid to bring a guiltiness upon me, and to take away my life.</p>
               <p>The like offer was made to my wife in reference to the procurement of my escape out of Windsor Castle, by one Captain Kempe of Collonell Prides

regiment, with the addition of an intended cheat; but I was delivered as a bird, out of the snare of these fowlers, so that I was not catcht with their chaff.—</p>
               <p>About the same time, shortly after my coming to Windsor Castle, having opportunity to send to my deare wife (whom I had left in a disconsolat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition att London, great with child, and within a few weeks of her delivery) as I had sealed my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and was ready to dispatch itt away, I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice given me by my keeper, that the Governour must see whatever letters I wrote or received; whereupon I bad him carry itt unto him, that he might open it if he thought fitt: But the Governour returned itt back unto me untouched, with this compliment, that I was very much mistaken in him if I thought he would be so unworthy, as to open letters between a man and his wife; and with some further expressions of respect to me, in regard, he had formerly served as a Lieutenant Colonell under me. This I tooke as a civility from him, but I found it after to be no other than a meere insiduous practise; for after an uninterrupted pasage of letters between my wife and me, for about a fortnight or three weekes, by which time he supposed, wee might be grown to a confidence to write freely, he suddainly seised upon all my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0516400600:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>

Walking out northward of the citty, soon after her laying in, she stopped att the cottage of a poore woman whom she heard making doleful cries. She sent one of her train to know what itt might be which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned itt; the page returned and said the woman was sorrowing grievously, because her daughter had been two days in the strawe, and was almost dead for want of nourishment, she having nothing to give her but water, and not being able for the hardness of the times to gett any thing. On this the Queen tooke a small chain of gould from her neck att which hung an agnus; she tooke off the agnus and putt itt in her bosom, and making the woman be called to her, gave her the chain and bad her to go into the citty to a gouldsmith and sell itt, and keepe the money to provide for the good woman in the strawe. And for this her confessor did afterward rebuke her, because they were hereticks: when this thing was told to the King, he asked, jestingly, if her Confessor had made the Queen do a penance for itt; as she haddon once before, for some innocent act, when she was made to walke to Tyburn, some say barefoot.</p>

As an oficer he was obedient, and did never dispute my orders, nor argue upon them. He did, indeed, seeme to have great cunning, and whilst he was cautious of his own words, not putting forth too many lest they should betray his thoughts, he made others talk, untill he had as it were sifted them, and known their inmost designs. A notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance was his discovering in one short conversation with one Captain Giles (a great favorite with the Lord Generall, and whome he most confided in), that although his words were full of zeal, and his actions seemingly brave, that his heart was not with the cause: and in fine, this man did shortly after join the enemy at Oxford, with three and twenty stout fellowes.

with which being surprised, I presumed to make a triall, whether itt were more than an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or no (the good Lord forgive me for that presumption), and taking upp another bible that lay by, itt opened likewise upon the same place: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few howers after, my wife was safely delivered.</p>
               <p>Not long after this, being at London, I was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly taken with a fitt of the stone, in that violence, that itt grew insupportable to me, whereupon I cast myself upon my knees, and besought God for his mercy to me, and before I rose upp, my paine was mitigated, and within one quarter of an hower I was perfectly well.</p>
               <p>After the death of my first wife, and of my son which I had by her (both very deare blessings to me) when I putt on a resolution to marry againe, I humbly besought God to provide such a wife for me, as might be an help to me in the way of his service, and that I might have a religious woman, or none, and when his providence directed me to Lady Ann Finch, and that all things were agreed upon between my Lord her father and me, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

Itt pleased the Lord to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer our praiers in as full a measure of comfort, as ever was powred out opon a married couple: and though att the first there were some litle differences in our natures, and judgments (as to some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars) yet within a litle while, that good God wrought us to that uniformity, that I may say wee were but as one soul, in two bodyes.</p>
               <p>After I had quitted the service of the Parliament in the field, and was returned to London, and there settled with my family; my estate began to fall short, part thereof lying in the Kings Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and the rest (through the distraction of the times) affording me very litle subsistence. To sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my necessityes, I was faine to sell severall things; and in the end I was at such a pinch, as that without selling my plate (which I had kept as my last reserve of vallue) I knew not how to send to markett: whereupon my wife and I having recommended our condition to God, resolved the next morning to send our plate to the gouldsmiths, and to make money of itt. But the next morning I was wakened by my servant, who lett me know there was one come from Barnstaple with some mony for me. The sum was not above fifteen

               <p>When his Majesty was at Worcester, I thought itt my duty to seeke God for him in that distressed condition; itt pleased the Lord to inlarge my heart, with much comfort, and to give me a confident as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, that I should have an answer of peace. The issue was, that his royall person was miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously delivered out of the hands of those hunters.</p>
               <p>After my returne from D—, when I tooke upp a resolution to marry againe; I besought God for his direction in my choice, who heard my petition, and sent me the Lady Harcourt to repaire the breach formerly made in my poore family; which was so rich a blessing, that I can never sufficiently acknowledg itt. That God (hearing praier) who hath (with the generall approbation of good men) united us by his sacred ordinance, and made us not only one flesh, but one spirit; one in our affections, judgments, wayes, ends, (as if wee had been both cutt out of one peece) he vouchsafes to preserve us together for the advancement of his service and glory.</p>
