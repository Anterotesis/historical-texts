            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I have taken the advantage of the licence uſually allowed to poets, of departing a little from chronology; and have poſtponed for a few years the inſtitution of this order, for the ſake of rendering that ſolemnity more auguſt, by introducing king John of France, who, though a priſoner, was treated both by Edward and his ſon the prince of Wales with all the regard due to the quality and virtue of ſo great a prince. To alleviate his captivity, Edward entertained him and the other French priſoners with diverſions of various kinds: among which a tournament he held at Windſor on the 23d of April, to ſolemnize the feaſt of St. George, the patron of the order of the GARTER, held the chief place; and was, as Rapin tells us, the moſt ſumptuous and magnificent that had ever been ſeen in England. The duke of Brabant, with ſeveral other ſovereign princes, and an infinite number of knights of all nations were preſent, and ſplendidly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</note> King of France, &amp;c.</item>

                        <note n="d" place="bottom">Edward being engaged in a war with France, for the obtaining that crown, in order to draw into England great multitudes of foreigners, with whom he might negociate either for their perſonal ſervice, or aids of troops to aſſiſt him in that undertaking, ordered, during the truce that then ſubſiſted between the two crowns, publication to be made of a great tournament to be held at Windſor; an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, ſays Rapin, which could not fail of ſucceſs, becauſe it was entirely agreeable to the taſte of that age. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly many perſons of diſtinction came over, to all of whom he gave an honourable reception, careſſing them in ſuch a manner that they could never ſufficiently admire his politeneſs, magnificence, and liberality. To render theſe entertainments the more ſolemn, and to free himſelf alſo from the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to which the difference of rank and condition would have ſubjected him, he cauſed a circular hall of boards to be run up at Windſor, 200 feet in diameter. There it was that he feaſted all the knights at one table, which was called the Round Table, in memory of the great Arthur, who, as it is pretended, inſtituted an order of knighthood by that name. Next year he cauſed a more ſolid building to be erected, that he might continue yearly the ſame diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. During that time he treated with theſe ſeveral lords about the aids, wherewith each could furniſh him, in proportion to his forces. His rival king Philip could not ſee without jealouſy, Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, and Frenchmen themſelves flock to England to aſſiſt at theſe tournamrnts. He ſuſpected ſome hidden deſign in theſe entertainments, and to break Edward's meoſures, cauſed the like to be publiſhed in his dominions; which meeting with ſucceſs, proved a countermine to Edward's main deſign, ſo that he did not long continue to keep up his round table. From thence, however, it is generally agreed, he took the firſt hint of inſtituting the order of the Garter. But as his purpoſe in erecting this order was very different from that which had induced him to revive Arthur's round table, as he had in this no private views, no ambitious ſcheme of engaging ſuch as ſhould be admitted into this fraternity to aſſiſt him in his wars, he thought proper, in order to obviate the like jealouſies and ſuſpicion as had alarmed king Philip, to ſignify by his motto the purity of his intentions, and to retort ſhame upon all thoſe who ſhould put any malignant conſtruction upon his deſign in inſtituting this order. This therefore I take to be the true meaning and import of the famous motto, HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE. The not underſtanding the purport of which, gave riſe in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to that vulgar ſtory of the counteſs of Saliſbury's garter, rejected by all the beſt writers.</note> ASHAM'D BE HE, WHO WITH MALIGNANT EYE</l>

               <l>OCHARLES, in abſence hear a friend complain,</l>
               <l>Who knows thou lov'ſt him whereſoe'er he goes,</l>
               <l>Yet feels uneaſy ſtarts of idle pain,</l>
               <l>And often would be told the thing he knows.</l>
               <l>Why then, thou loiterer, fleets the ſilent year,</l>
               <l>How dar'ſt thou give a friend unneceſſary fear?</l>
            </lg>

               <l>We do not now of diſtant ages dream,</l>
               <l>And cheat in converſe half the ling'ring day;</l>
               <l>No fancied heroes riſe at our command,</l>
               <l>And no TIMOLEON weeps, and bleeds no THEBAN band.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet why complain? thou feel'ſt no want like theſe,</l>
               <l>From me, 'tis true, but me alone debar'd,</l>
               <l>Thou ſtill in GRANTA's ſhade enjoy'ſt at eaſe</l>
               <l>The books we reverenc'd, and the friends we ſhar'd;</l>
               <l>Nor ſeeſt without ſuch aids the day decline,</l>

               <l>To them I owe whate'er I dare pretend.</l>
               <l>Thou ſaw'ſt with partial eyes, and bade me call thee friend.</l>

               <l>Let others meanly heap the treaſur'd ſtore,</l>

               <l>To leave a race more exquiſitely poor,</l>
               <l>Poſſeſs'd of riches which they ne'er enjoy;</l>
               <l>He's only kind who takes the nobler way</l>

               <l>Lords of themſelves, thank heaven that they were born</l>

               <l>And of the twice ſeven lines have clean got o'er ten.</l>
               <l>Courage! another'll finiſh the firſt triplet.</l>
               <l>Thanks to thee, muſe, my work begins to ſhorten,</l>
