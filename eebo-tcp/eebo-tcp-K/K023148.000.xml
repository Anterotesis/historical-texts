            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN reading ſeveral paſſages of the prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which
foretell the coming of Chriſt and the felicities attending it,
I could not but obſerve a remarkable parity between many of
the thoughts, and thoſe in the Pollio of <hi>Virgil.</hi> This will
not ſeem ſurpriſing, when we reflect, that the Eclogue was
taken from a Sibylline prophecy on the ſame ſubject. One
may judge that <hi>Virgil</hi> did not copy it line by line, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
ſuch ideas as beſt agreed with the nature of paſtoral
poetry, and diſpoſed them in that manner which ſerved moſt
to beautify his piece. I have endeavoured the ſame in this
imitation of him, though without admitting any thing of my
own; ſince it was written with this particular view, that
the reader, by comparing the ſeveral thoughts, might ſee how
for the images and deſcriptions of the Prophet are ſuperior
to thoſe of the Poet. But as I fear I have prejudiced
them by my management, I ſhall ſubjoin the paſſages of
<hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Virgil,</hi> under the ſame diſadvantage
of a literal tranſlation.</p>

meant the <hi>ſight,</hi> or, as <hi>Milton</hi> calls it, indeed, ſomething leſs
boldly, <hi>viſual nerve.</hi> And no critic would quarrel with the
figure which calls the <hi>inſtrument</hi> of viſion by the name of the

ſublime, yet the expreſſion of <hi>thick films</hi> is faulty, and he fell
into it by a common neglect of the following rule of good
writing, <q>That when a figurative word is uſed, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is predicated of it ought not only to agree in terms to
the thing to which the figure is applied, but likewiſe to
that from which the figure is taken.</q> 
               <hi>Thick films</hi> agree
only with the thing to which it is applied, namely, to the
<hi>ſight</hi> or eve; and not to that from which it is taken, namely,
a <hi>ray of light</hi> coming to the eye. He ſhould have ſaid <hi>thick
clouds,</hi> which would have agreed with both. But theſe inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacies
are not to be found in his later poems.</p>
