            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE Reverend Mr. White,</hi> ſo agreeably
known to the public by his <hi>Natural Hiſtory
of Selborne,</hi> left behind him a ſeries of yearly
books, containing his diurnal obſervations
on the occurrences in the various walks of
rural nature, from the year 1768 to the time
of his death in 1793. From theſe annals he
had already extracted all the matter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
in the work above mentioned, down
to the middle of 1787; but ſeveral curious
facts in the preceding numbers had not been
thus employed; and all the ſubſequent ones
remained untouched. It was thought a mark
of reſpect due to his memory, and to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
he had acquired as a faithful and
elegant obſerver, not to conſign theſe relicks
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0223501400:3"/>
to neglect. The manuſcripts were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
put into my hands for the purpoſe of
ſelecting from them what might ſeem worthy
of laying before the public. The preſent
ſmall publication is the fruit of my reſearch.
With no ſmall pains I collected the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
of it, diſperſed through the records of
ſo many years, and gave them ſuch an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement
as I thought would preſent them
in the moſt agreeable and uſeful manner to
the lovers of natural knowledge.</p>

            <p>THE mode in which the following rural
calendar of the year has been compoſed, was
to copy out from the journals all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
thought worthy of noting, with
the ſeveral dates of their recurrence, and to
preſerve the earlieſt and lateſt of theſe dates;
ſo that the calendar exhibits the extreme
range of variation in the firſt occurrence of
all the phenomena mentioned. To many
of them only one date is annexed, only one
obſervation having been entered. This is
particularly the caſe with reſpect to the
flowering of plants, with which the book of
1768 alone was copiouſly filled; and it is to
be noted that this was rather a backward year.</p>

Red-ſtarts, Fly-catchers and Black-caps
arrive early in April. If theſe little delicate
beings are birds of paſſage, (as we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to ſuppoſe they are, becauſe they are
never ſeen in winter) how could they, feeble
as they ſeem, bear up againſt ſuch ſtorms
of ſnow and rain, and make their way
through ſuch meteorous turbulencies, as
one ſhould ſuppoſe would embarraſs and
retard the moſt hardy and reſolute of the
winged nation? Yet they keep their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
times and ſeaſons; and in ſpite of
froſts and winds return to their ſtations pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodically
as if they had met with nothing
to obſtruct them. The withdrawing and
appearance of the <hi>ſhort winged</hi> ſummer birds
is a very puzzling circumſtance in natural

                  <p>When the boys bring me waſps neſts, my

young waſps in their maggot ſtate with the
higheſt glee and delight. Any inſect-eating
bird would do the ſame; and therefore I
have often wondered that the accurate Mr.
Ray ſhould call one ſpecies of buzzard <hi>buteo
apivorus</hi> ſive <hi>veſpivorus,</hi> or the <hi>honey buzzard,</hi>
becauſe ſome combs of waſps happened to
be found in one of their neſts. The combs
were conveyed thither doubtleſs for the ſake
of the maggots or nymphs, and not for their
honey: ſince none is to be found in the
combs of waſps. Birds of prey occaſionally
feed on inſects: thus have I ſeen a tame
kite picking up the female ants full of eggs,
with much ſatisfaction.</p>

                  <p>THRUSHES during long droughts are of

                     <hi>Miſſel</hi> thruſhes do not deſtroy the fruit in

feed on the berries of miſſeltoe, and in the

                  <p>MANY creatures are endowed with a ready

Thus my neighbour's poultry watch
for waggons loaded with wheat, and running
after them, pick up a number of grains
which are ſhaken from the ſheaves by the

ſparrows, his cats would run out before

they fell.</p>
                  <p>The earneſt and early propenſity of the

gallinae to rooſt on high is very obſervable;
and diſcovers a ſtrong dread impreſſed on
their ſpirits reſpecting vermin that may
annoy them on the ground during the hours

and not houſed, will perch the winter

turkies, and guinea fowls, heavy as they are,
get up into apple-trees: pheaſants alſo in

pea fowls climb to the tops of the higheſt

                  <p>LORD Stawell ſent me from the great
lodge in the holt a curious bird for my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection.
It was found by the ſpaniels of
one of his keepers in a coppice, and ſhot on
the wing. The ſhape, and air, and habit
of the bird, and the ſcarlet ring round the
eyes, agreed well with the appearance of a
cock pheaſant; but then the head and neck
and breaſt and belly were of a gloſſy black:
and though it weighed 3 lb. 3½ oz.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hen pheaſants uſually weigh only 2 lb. 1 oz.</note> the
weight of a large full grown cock pheaſant,
yet there were no ſigns of any ſpurs on the
legs, as is uſual with all grown cock phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants,
who have long ones. The legs and
feet were naked of feathers; and therefore it
could be nothing of the grous kind. In
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0223501400:63"/>
the tail were no long bending feathers, ſuch
as cock pheaſants uſually have; and are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic
of the ſex. The tail was much
ſhorter than the tail of a hen pheaſant, and
blunt and ſquare at the end. The back,
wing-feathers, and tail, were all of a pale
ruſſet curiouſly ſtreaked, ſomewhat like the
upper parts of a hen partridge. I returned
it, with my verdict, that it was probably a
ſpurious or hybrid hen bird, bred between
a cock pheaſant and ſome domeſtic fowl.
When I came to talk with the keeper who
brought it, he told me that ſome peahens had
been known laſt ſummer to haunt the coppices
and coverts where this mule was found.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Elmer, of Farnham, the famous game
painter, was employed to take an exact copy
of this curious bird.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>N. B.</hi> It ought to be mentioned, that
ſome good judges have imagined this bird to
have been a ſtray grous or black-cock; it is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0223501400:64"/>
however to be obſerved, that Mr. W. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
that its legs and feet were naked, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
thoſe of the grous are feathered to the toes.</p>

                  <p>A MAN brought me a <hi>land-rail</hi> or <hi>daker-hen,</hi>
a bird ſo rare in this diſtrict, that we
ſeldom ſee more than one or two in a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and thoſe only in autumn. This is
deemed a bird of paſſage by all the writers:
yet from its formation ſeems to be poorly
qualified for migration; for its wings are
ſhort, and placed ſo forward, and out of
the centre of gravity, that it flies in a very
heavy and embarraſſed manner, with its legs
hanging down; and can hardly be ſprung a
ſecond time, as it runs very faſt, and ſeems
to depend more on the ſwiftneſs of its feet
than on its flying.</p>
                  <p>When we came to draw it, we found the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0223501400:65"/>
entrails ſo ſoft and tender that in appearance
they might have been dreſſed like the ropes
of a woodcock. The craw or crop was
ſmall and lank, containing a mucus; the
gizzard thick and ſtrong, and filled with
ſmall ſhell ſnails, ſome whole, and many
ground to pieces through the attrition which
is occaſioned by the muſcular force and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that inteſtine. We ſaw no gravels
among the food: perhaps the ſhell ſnails
might perform the functions of gravels or
pebbles, and might grind one another. <hi>Land-rails</hi>
uſed to abound formerly, I remember,
in the low wet bean fields of Chriſtian-Malford
in North Wilts, and in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
near Paradiſe gardens at Oxford, where
I have often heard them cry crex, crex.
The bird mentioned above weighed 7½ oz.
was fat and tender, and in flavour like the

                  <p>ONE of my neighbours ſhot a ring-dove
on an evening as it was returning from feed
and going to rooſt. When his wife had
picked and drawn it, ſhe found its craw
ſtuffed with the moſt nice and tender tops
of turnips. Theſe ſhe waſhed and boiled,
and ſo ſate down to a choice and delicate
plate of greens, culled and provided in this
extraordinary manner.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may ſee that graminivorous
birds, when grain fails, can ſubſiſt on the

without, for turkies, though corn fed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

                  <p>MR. WHITE of Newton ſprung a phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
in a wheat ſtubble, and ſhot at it;
when, notwithſtanding the report of the gun,
it was immediately purſued by the blue
hawk, known by the name of the <hi>hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harrier,</hi>
but eſcaped into ſome covert. He
then ſprung a ſecond, and a third, in the ſame
field, that got away in the ſame manner;
the hawk hovering round him all the while
that he was beating the field, conſcious no
doubt of the game that lurked in the
ſtubble. Hence we may conclude that this
bird of prey was rendered very daring and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0223501400:68"/>
bold by hunger, and that hawks cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſeize their game when they pleaſe.
We may farther obſerve, that they cannot
pounce their quarry on the ground where it
might be able to make a ſtout reſiſtance,
ſince ſo large a fowl as a pheaſant could
not but be viſible to the piercing eye of a
hawk when hovering over a field. Hence
that propenſity of cowring and ſquatting till
they are almoſt trod on, which no doubt
was intended as a mode of ſecurity: though
long rendered deſtructive to the whole race
of gallinae by the invention of nets and
guns.</p>

                  <head>GREAT SPECKLED DIVER, OR LOON.</head>
                  <p>As one of my neighbours was traverſing
Wolmer foreſt from Bramſhot acroſs the
moors, he found a large uncommon bird
fluttering in the heath, but not wounded,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0223501400:69"/>
which he brought home alive. On exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
it proved to be <hi>Colymbus glacialis
Linn:</hi> the great ſpeckled diver or loon,
which is moſt excellently deſcribed in Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lughby's
ornithology.</p>
                  <p>Every part and proportion of this bird
is ſo incomparably adapted to its mode of
life, that in no inſtance do we ſee the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God in the creation to more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
The head is ſharp, and ſmaller
than the part of the neck adjoining, in order
that it may pierce the water; the wings are
placed forward and out of the center of
gravity, for a purpoſe which ſhall be noticed
hereafter; the thighs quite at the podex, in
order to facilitate diving; and the legs are
flat, and as ſharp backwards almoſt as the
edge of a knife, that in ſtriking they may
eaſily cut the water; while the feet are
palmated, and broad for ſwimming, yet ſo
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0223501400:70"/>
folded up when advanced forward to take
a freſh ſtroke, as to be full as narrow as the
ſhank. The two exterior toes of the feet
are longeſt; the nails flat and broad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
the human, which give ſtrength
and increaſe the power of ſwimming. The
foot, when expanded, is not at right angles
to the leg or body of the bird: but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
part inclining towards the head forms
an acute angle with the body; the intention
being not to give motion in the line of the
legs themſelves, but by the combined im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
of both in an intermediate line, the line
of the body.</p>
                  <p>Moſt people know, that have obſerved at
all, that the ſwimming of birds is nothing
more than a walking in the water, where
one foot ſucceeds the other as on the land;
yet no one, as far as I am aware, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0223501400:71"/>
that diving fowls, while under water,
impel and row themſelves forward by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their wings, as well as by the impulſe
of their feet: but ſuch is really the caſe, as
any perſon may eaſily be convinced who will
obſerve ducks when hunted by dogs in a
clear pond. Nor do I know that any one
has given a reaſon why the wings of diving
fowls are placed ſo forward: doubtleſs, not
for the purpoſe of promoting their ſpeed in
flying, ſince that poſition certainly impedes
it; but probably for the increaſe of their
motion under water, by the uſe of four oars
inſtead of two; yet were the wings and feet
nearer together, as in land birds, they would,
when in action, rather hinder than aſſiſt one
another.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Colymbus</hi> was of conſiderable bulk,
weighing only three drachms ſhort of three
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0223501400:72"/>
pounds avoirdupois. It meaſured in length
from the bill to the tail (which was very
ſhort) two feet; and to the extremities of
the toes four inches more; and the breadth
of the wings expanded was 42 inches. A
perſon attempted to eat the body, but found
it very ſtrong and rancid, as is the fleſh of
all birds living on fiſh. <hi>Divers</hi> or <hi>Loons,</hi>
though bred in the moſt northerly parts of
Europe, yet are ſeen with us in very ſevere
winters; and on the Thames are called <hi>ſprat
loons,</hi> becauſe they prey much on that ſort
of fiſh.</p>
                  <p>The legs of the <hi>Colymbi</hi> and <hi>Mergi</hi> are
placed ſo very backward, and ſo out of all
center of gravity, that theſe birds cannot
walk at all. They are called by Linnaeus
<hi>compedes,</hi> becauſe they move on the ground
as if ſhackled, or fettered.</p>

                  <p>ON the 27th of February 1788, <hi>Stone Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lews</hi>
were heard to pipe; and on March 1ſt,
after it was dark, ſome were paſſing over the
village, as might be perceived by their
quick ſhort note, which they uſe in their
nocturnal excurſions by way of watch-word,
that they may not ſtray and loſe their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.</p>
                  <p>Thus, we ſee, that retire whitherſoever they
may in the winter, they return again early
in the ſpring, and are, as it now appears,
the firſt ſummer birds that come back.
Perhaps the mildneſs of the ſeaſon may
have quickened the emigration of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lews

                  <p>They ſpend the day in high elevated fields

                  <p>THE country people have a notion that
the <hi>fern owl,</hi> or <hi>churn owl,</hi> or <hi>eve-jarr,</hi> which
they alſo call a <hi>puckeridge,</hi> is very injurious
to weanling calves, by inflicting, as it ſtrikes
at them, the fatal diſtemper known to cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeches

does this harmleſs, ill-fated bird fall under
a double imputation which it by no means
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0223501400:75"/>
deſerves; in Italy, of ſucking the teats of
goats, whence it is called <hi>caprimulgus</hi>; and
with us, of communicating a deadly diſorder
to cattle. But the truth of the matter is, the
malady above mentioned is occaſioned by
the <hi>Oeſtrus bovis,</hi> a dipterous inſect which
lays its eggs along the chines of kine, where
the maggots, when hatched, eat their way
through the hide of the beaſt into the fleſh,
and grow to a very large ſize. I have juſt
talked with a man, who ſays, he has more
than once ſtripped calves who have died of
the <hi>puckeridge</hi>; that the ail or complaint lay
along the chine, where the fleſh was much
ſwelled, and filled with purulent matter.
Once I myſelf ſaw a large rough maggot of
this ſort ſqueezed out of the back of a cow.</p>
                  <p>Theſe maggots in Eſſex are called wornils.</p>
                  <p>The leaſt obſervation and attention would
convince men, that theſe birds neither injure
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0223501400:76"/>
the goatherd nor the grazier, but are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
harmleſs, and ſubſiſt alone, being night
birds, on night inſects, ſuch as <hi>ſcarabaei</hi> and
<hi>phalaenae</hi>; and through the month of July
moſtly on the <hi>ſcarabaeus ſolſtitialis,</hi> which in
many diſtricts abounds at that ſeaſon. Thoſe
that we have opened, have always had their
craws ſtuffed with large night-moths and
their eggs, and pieces of chaffers: nor does
it anywiſe appear how they can, weak and
unarmed as they ſeem, inflict any harm
upon kine, unleſs they poſſeſs the powers of
animal magnetiſm, and can affect them by
fluttering over them.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>fern owl,</hi> this evening (Auguſt 27),
ſhowed off in a very unuſual and entertaining
manner, by hawking round and round the
circumference of my great ſpreading oak,
for twenty times following, keeping moſtly
cloſe to the graſs, but occaſionally glanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0223501400:77"/>
up amidſt the boughs of the tree. This
amuſing bird was then in purſuit of a brood
of ſome particular phalaena belonging to the
oak, of which there are ſeveral ſorts; and
exhibited on the occaſion a command of
wing ſuperior, I think, to that of the ſwallow
itſelf.</p>
                  <p>When a perſon approaches the haunt of
fern-owls in an evening, they continue fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
round the head of the obtruder, and by
ſtriking their wings together above their
backs, in the manner that the pigeons called
ſmiters are known to do, make a ſmart
ſnap: perhaps at that time they are jealous
for their young; and this noiſe and geſture
are intended by way of menace.</p>
                  <p>Fern-owls have attachment to oaks, no
doubt on account of food; for the next
evening we ſaw one again ſeveral times
among the boughs of the ſame tree; but it
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0223501400:78"/>
did not ſkim round its ſtem over the graſs;
as on the evening before. In May theſe
birds find the <hi>Scarabaeus melolontha</hi> on the
oak; and the <hi>Scarabaeus ſolſtitialis</hi> at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer.
Theſe peculiar birds can only be
watched and obſerved for two hours in the
twenty-four; and then in a dubious twilight,
an hour after ſun-ſet and an hour before
ſun-riſe.</p>
                  <p>On this day (July 14, 1789) a woman
brought me two eggs of a <hi>fern-owl,</hi> or <hi>eve-jarr,</hi>
which ſhe found on the verge of the
hanger, to the left of the hermitage under
a beechen ſhrub. This perſon, who lives
juſt at the foot of the hanger, ſeems well
acquainted with theſe nocturnal ſwallows,
and ſays ſhe has often found their eggs near
that place, and that they lay only two at a
time on the bare ground. The eggs were
oblong, duſky, and ſtreaked ſomewhat in the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0223501400:79"/>
manner of the plumage of the parent bird,
and were equal in ſize at each end. The
dam was ſitting on the eggs when found,
which contained the rudiments of young,
and would have been hatched perhaps in a
week. From hence we may ſee the time
of their breeding, which correſponds pretty
well with that of the ſwift, as does alſo the
period of their arrival. Each ſpecies is
uſually ſeen about the beginning of May.
Each breeds but once in a ſummer; each
lays only two eggs.</p>
                  <p>July 4, 1790. The woman who brought
me two <hi>Fern-owls</hi> eggs laſt year on July 14,
on this day produced me two more, one of
which had been laid this morning, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
plainly, becauſe there was only one in
the neſt the evening before. They were
found, as laſt July, on the verge of the down
above the hermitage under a beechen ſhrub,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0223501400:80"/>
on the naked ground.—Laſt year thoſe eggs
were full of young, and juſt ready to be
hatched.</p>
                  <p>Theſe circumſtances point out the exact
time when theſe curious nocturnal migra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
birds lay their eggs, and hatch their
young.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fern-owls,</hi> like ſnipes, ſtone curlews, and
ſome other birds, make no neſt. Birds that
build on the ground do not make much of
neſts.</p>

                  <head>SAND MARTINS.</head>
                  <p>MARCH 23, 1788. A gentleman who was
this week on a viſit at Waverley, took the
opportunity of examining ſome of the holes
in the ſand banks with which that diſtrict
abounds. As theſe are undoubtedly bored
by bank-martins, and are the places where
they avowedly breed, he was in hopes they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0223501400:81"/>
might have ſlept there alſo, and that he
might have ſurpriſed them juſt as they
were awaking from their winter ſlumbers.
When he had dug for ſome time, he found
the holes were horizontal, and ſerpentine, as
I had obſerved before; and that the neſts
were depoſited at the inner end, and had
been occupied by broods in former ſummers:
but no torpid birds were to be found. He
opened and examined about a dozen holes.
Another gentleman made the ſame ſearch
many years ago, with as little ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe holes were in depth about two
feet.</p>
                  <p>March 21, 1790. A ſingle <hi>bank</hi> or <hi>ſand
martin</hi> was ſeen hovering and playing round
the ſand pit at Short heath, where in the
ſummer they abound.</p>
                  <p>April 9, 1793. A ſober hind aſſures us,
that this day, on Wiſh-hanger common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0223501400:82"/>
Hedleigh and Frinſham, he ſaw ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>bank-martins</hi> playing in and out, and
hanging before ſome neſt holes in a ſand
hill, where theſe birds uſually neſtle.</p>
                  <p>This incident confirms my ſuſpicions, that
this ſpecies of hirundo is to be ſeen firſt of
any; and gives great reaſon to ſuppoſe that
they do not leave their wild haunts at all,
but are ſecreted amidſt the clefts and caverns
of thoſe abrupt cliffs where they uſually ſpend
their ſummers.</p>
                  <p>The late ſevere weather conſidered, it is
not very probable that theſe birds ſhould
have migrated ſo early from a tropical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
through all theſe cutting winds, and
pinching froſts: but it is eaſy to ſuppoſe that
they may, like bats and flies, have been
awakened by the influence of the ſun, amidſt
their ſecret latebrae where they have ſpent the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0223501400:83"/>
uncomfortable, foodleſs months in a torpid

                  <p>There is a large pond at Wiſh-hanger

themſelves, and are hardly ever ſeen,
nor do any inſects appear for their ſupport.
That they can retire to reſt, and ſleep away
theſe uncomfortable periods, as the bats do,
is a matter rather to be ſuſpected than
proved: or do they not rather ſpend their
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0223501400:84"/>
time in deep and ſheltered vales near waters,
where inſects are more likely to be found?
Certain it is, that hardly any individuals of
this genus have at ſuch times been ſeen for
ſeveral days together.</p>
                  <p>September 13, 1791. The congregating
flocks of hirundines on the church and tower
are very beautiful and amuſing! When they
fly off all together from the roof, on any
alarm, they quite ſwarm in the air. But
they ſoon ſettle in heaps, and preening their
feathers, and lifting up their wings to admit
the ſun, ſeem highly to enjoy the warm
ſituation. Thus they ſpend the heat of the
day, preparing for their emigration, and as it
were conſulting when and where they are to
go. The flight about the church ſeems to
conſiſt chiefly of houſe-martins, about 400
in number: but there are other places of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0223501400:85"/>
rendezvouz about the village frequented at
the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>It is remarkable, that though moſt of them
ſit on the battlements and roof, yet many
hang or cling for ſome time by their claws
againſt the ſurface of the walls, in a manner
not practiſed by them at any other time of

                  <p>The ſwallows ſeem to delight more in
holding their aſſemblies on trees.</p>
                  <p>Nov. 3, 1789. Two ſwallows were ſeen
this morning at Newton vicarage houſe,
hovering and ſettling on the roofs and out-buildings.
None have been obſerved at
Selborne ſince October 11. It is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
that after the hirundines have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared
for ſome weeks, a few are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally
ſeen again. Sometimes, in the firſt
week in November, and that only for one
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0223501400:86"/>
day. Do they not withdraw and ſlumber in
ſome hiding place during the interval? for
we cannot ſuppoſe they had migrated to
warmer climes, and ſo returned again for
one day. Is it not more probable that they
are awakened from ſleep, and like the bats
are come forth to collect a little food? Bats
appear at all ſeaſons, through the autumn
and ſpring months, when the thermometer is
at 50, becauſe then phalaenae, moths, are
ſtirring.</p>

of fruits. Mr. B. obſerved that this bird
frequented the ſpot where plum trees grow;
and that he had ſeen it with ſomewhat hard
in its mouth, which it broke with difficulty;
theſe were the ſtones of damſons. The latin
ornithologiſts call this bird <hi>coccothrauſtes,</hi> i. e.
<hi>berry-breaker,</hi> becauſe with its large, horny
beak, it cracks and breaks the ſhells of ſtone
fruits for the ſake of the ſeed or kernel.
Birds of this ſort are rarely ſeen in England,
and only in winter.</p>

                  <p>ABOUT the beginning of July, a ſpecies of
fly (muſca) obtains, which proves very tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
to horſes, trying ſtill to enter their
noſtrils and ears, and actually laying their
eggs in the latter of thoſe organs, or perhaps
in both. When theſe abound, horſes in
woodland diſtricts become very impatient at
their work, continually toſſing their heads,
and rubbing their noſes on each other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs
of the driver, ſo that accidents often
enſue. In the heat of the day, men are often
obliged to deſiſt from plowing. Saddle-horſes
are alſo very troubleſome at ſuch ſeaſons.
Country people call this inſect the <hi>noſe fly.</hi>

                  <p>I SAW lately a ſmall Ichneumon fly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
a ſpider much larger than itſelf on a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0223501400:110"/>
graſs walk. When the ſpider made any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
the Ichneumon applied her tail to
him, and ſtung him with great vehemence,
ſo that he ſoon became dead and motionleſs.
The Ichneumon then running backward drew
her prey very nimbly over the walk into the
ſtanding graſs. This ſpider would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited
in ſome hole where the Ichneumon
would lay ſome eggs; and as ſoon as the
eggs were hatched, the carcaſe would afford
ready food for the maggots.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps ſome eggs might be injected into
the body of the ſpider, in the act of ſtinging.

                  <p>IN the decline of the year, when the

ſpecies of flies (muſcae) retire into houſes,
and ſwarm in the windows.</p>
                  <p>At firſt they are very briſk and alert; but
as they grow more torpid, one cannot help

as if glued to the glaſs; and by degrees

It has been obſerved that divers flies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
their ſharp, hooked nails, have alſo
ſkinny palms, or flaps to their feet, whereby
they are enabled to ſtick on glaſs and other
ſmooth bodies, and to walk on ceilings with
their backs downward by means of the preſſure
of the atmoſphere on thoſe flaps: the weight
of which they eaſily overcome in warm wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when they are briſk and alert. But in the
decline of the year, this reſiſtance becomes
too mighty for their diminiſhed ſtrength; and
we ſee flies labouring along, and lugging
their feet in windows as if they ſtuck faſt to
the glaſs, and it is with the utmoſt difficulty
they can draw one foot after another, and
diſengage their hollow caps from the ſlippery
ſurface.</p>
                  <p>Upon the ſame principle that flies ſtick

The cauſe why the ſlugs are able to endure

but before the growing ſeaſon was
over, the whole ſhoot of the year, and three

by one horſe, and guided by two handles.

                  <p>Hops are diécious plants: hence perhaps
it might be proper, though not practiſed, to
leave purpoſely ſome male plants in every

the bloſſoms. The female plants without
their male attendants are not in their natural
ſtate: hence we may ſuppoſe the frequent
failure of crop ſo incident to hop-grounds; no

frequent and general failures as hops.</p>
