            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <speaker>Oct.</speaker>
                  <p>I really think, Sir, that, as your chief mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for taking the apartment is to ſerve Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> the ſooner you and your family come into it, the better.</p>

                  <p>Upon my word, Sir, it is ſomething very extraordinary—We left the things here in good order, a little while ago, and this moment that we came into the room again, we found them in the condition you ſee.</p>

                  <p>O! damn it, no; it would not do for me at all. Service with a ſingle gentleman, well and good; but married families are hell and the devil.</p>

                  <p>I have been at the Duke of <hi>Medina's;</hi> and I find his wounds are not ſo bad as I at firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. The report, however, of Don <hi>Pedro</hi> being the perſon who aſſaulted him, rather gains ground.</p>

                  <p>And we may have a viſit from them in the night, perhaps, when we leaſt deſire their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. I'll ſtrive to prevent them. Come hither, you Sir. Go to the Conde de <hi>Lemos,</hi> governor of Madrid; his palace is hard by; give my reſpects,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1240700400:24"/>and tell his excellency, I ſhall be much obliged to him, if he will order me directly a couple of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels to ſtand at my door: Tell him I ſhall want them for two or three days, till I have married my daughter.</p>

                  <p>I ſay then, Sir, I never did; for the thing was firſt mentioned to me: and, isn't it common enough, when a genteel likely girl lives in the houſe with a gentleman, for people to talk?</p>
