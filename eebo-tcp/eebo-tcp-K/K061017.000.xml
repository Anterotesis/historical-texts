         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> COMMONWEALTH is a
Machine actuated by many
Wheels, one dependant on the
other, yet the Obſtruction of
a ſmall Wheel may ſtop the
Motion of the whole: Every Man ought
therefore as much as in him lies, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
in his Station, to the publick Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
and not be afraid or aſhamed of
doing, or at leaſt, meaning well.</p>
            <p>I hope therefore the Reader will excuſe
the Vanity of an over officious <hi>Old Man,</hi>
if like <hi>Cato,</hi> I enquire whether or no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0038601100:5"/>
I go hence and be no more, I can yet
do any thing for the Service of my Country.</p>
            <p>For if every Man ſhould ſay Children
are burthenſome, and the Cauſe of many
Sorrows, therefore will not I be a Father,
farewel to all Ties of Nature, and
every Bleſſing of human Society.</p>
            <p>Or if every Man ſhould ſay to himſelf,
what have I to do with State Affairs?
is it my Buſineſs? are there not enough
at the Helm? what need I interfere? Let
me be ſubject to the Higher Powers, and
let Matters ſink or ſwim, I ſhall have
Neighbours Fare.</p>
            <p>Would not this be a very churliſh Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution?
would it not very much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to univerſal Anarchy and Confuſion?
ſhould every Man thus throw the Care of
the Publick from his ſhoulders, and acquit
himſelf of any Concern for the reſt of
Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0038601100:6"/>
This would be my Caſe, ſhould I, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I am Maſter of a Project, which in
all probability, may be of great uſe to
Mankind, reaſon thus to my ſelf; what
have I to do to divulge my Secrets?
What though they are of Benefit to the
Publick, ſhall I reap any Advantage by
them? Shall I not rather be laugh'd at and
deſpiſed as a Projector, the moſt contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
Character in this Part of the World?
May not another run away with the Profits
of my Labour, and by a little Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
make my Project his own? is it not
better for me to repoſe myſelf, to die in
Peace, and leave an ungrateful World to
their own Imaginations? <hi>Non nobis nati
ſumus.</hi> That Thought would quaſh all harſh
Contemplations, I could hazard with
Pleaſure, the publick Contumely for the
publick Good, knowing it has been the Fate
of much better Men than my ſelf, to be
deſpiſed when living, tho' rever'd when
dead.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0038601100:7"/>
Prompted by this Reflection, I once more
take Pen in Hand, as I hope for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of my Country: If my Countrymen
find what I advance practicable, I hope
they will not call my Integrity in queſtion.
and if they have patience to read my well
intended Thoughts, tho' digeſted I fear but
too mildly, and in too mean a Stile, I hope
they will find I have advanc'd nothing
but what is practicable, beneficial, and
without Self-Intereſt; having excluded my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from any propriety in my own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
by thus publiſhing it and making it
every Body's: and if any think I write
for Money, let them ask my Bookſeller.</p>
            <p>Alas I have but ſmall Health and
little Leiſure to turn Author, being now
in my 67<hi>th</hi> Year, almoſt worn out with
Age and Sickneſs. The <hi>Old Man</hi> cannot
trouble you long; take then in good part
his beſt Intentions, and impute his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
to Age and Weakneſs: Look on
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0038601100:8"/>
him as a Man of more Experience than
Learning; excuſe his Stile for the ſake of
his Subject, and take the Will for the
Deed. Aſſure your ſelf, gentle Reader,
I had not publiſhed my Project in this Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,
could I have got it inſerted in any
of the Journals, without Feeing the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliſts
or Publiſhers.</p>
            <p>I cannot but have the Vanity to think,
they might as well have inſerted what
I ſent them, <hi>Gratis,</hi> as many Things I
have ſince ſeen in their Papers. But I
have not only had the Mortification to
find what I ſent rejected, but to loſe my
Originals, not having taken Copies of what
I wrote.</p>
            <p>However, to juſtify my Complaints to
the World, I ſhall, in a proper Place, let
them know the Subſtance of what was
rejected, and by whom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0038601100:9"/>
In the mean time, give me leave to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
my Readers, that the Reaſon why
this Project appears in a Pamphlet is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I have been thus baffled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartened
by Journaliſts; for if by any
Means the Publick could have had it at a
cheaper Rate, I had been better pleaſed.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is nothing on Earth
more ſhocking, and withal more
common, in but too many Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
than to ſee Age and Grey
Hairs derided, and ill uſed. The OLD
MAN or the OLD WOMAN, can do
nothing to pleaſe; their Words are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
their Actions miſrepreſented, and
themſelves look'd upon as a Burthen to
their Iſſue, and a Rent Charge upon thoſe
who came from their Loins.</p>
            <p>This Treatment, as it is directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to the Dignity and Decency of Human
Nature, calls aloud for Redreſs; the Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and innocent ought to be the care
of the Healthy and able. Shall a Man or
Woman toil and moil to bring up a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Iſſue? ſhall they rear up, thro' all
the Uncertainties and Fatigues of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
a Race who ſhall ſpring up but to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0038601100:11"/>
abandon them? ſhall they enfeeble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to give Strength to thoſe who ſhall
one Day thruſt them aſide, and deſpiſe them?</p>
            <p>Yet this is the Caſe of many aged Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who have outlived the Comforts of
this World; who ſurvive only to hear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
wiſh'd out of the way, by thoſe
very Perſons upon whom they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
their whole Subſtance, and upon
whom their whole Hopes have been fixed.
Uncertain Hopes indeed! and far unfit for ſo
degenerate an Age. <hi>Honour thy Father
and thy Mother</hi> is a Commandment given
by God, and ratified by our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
both in Precept and Example; If ſo,
what Brutes are thoſe who ſhall dare to
ſpurn thoſe Perſons whom God has thought
fit to make the Means of their Entrance
into human Life?</p>
            <p>But indeed, not only Parents, but all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
People in general, are thought to ſtand
in the way of the preſent Generation: and
but for ſome good Children, ſome Perſons
of Tenderneſs and Humanity, who honour
the hoary Head, and comfort the Feeble;
immediate Vengeance would be pulled
down on thoſe who let not their Sires
live out half their Days.</p>
            <p>The Word OLD is a ſtanding Jeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
our youthful Gentry. When they
would frighten Children, they tell them
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0038601100:12"/>
               <hi>The old Man's a coming:</hi> Thus they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate
an Abhorrence of Age, even in
ſucking Babes; which no doubt will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
with adult Age, according to the Proverb;
<q>
                  <l>Quo ſemel eſt imbuta recens, ſervabit odorem</l>
                  <l>Teſta diu.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>IF any whimſical or ridiculous Story is
told, 'tis of an <hi>Old Woman.</hi> If any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is aukward at his Buſineſs, or any
thing elſe, he is called an <hi>Old Woman,</hi>
forſooth; But this is no new thing, for
we read in former Ages, that they made
Witches of their Old Women. Thoſe
were brave Days for young People, when
they could ſwear the old Ones out of
their Lives! and get a Woman hanged or
burnt only for being a little too old; as
has been the Caſe of many a poor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
ancient Creature. The Story of the
Witch, <hi>alias,</hi> the poor Old Woman of
<hi>Hertford,</hi> is yet freſh in every one's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;
and had not the very Judges on the
Bench ſeen through the Enthuſiaſm and
Obſtinacy of the Evidence, who ſwore tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
thick and thin: had not the Judges
themſelves, I ſay, repreſented the thing in a
right Light to the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> poor
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0038601100:13"/>
               <hi>Jane Wenman</hi> had certainly been truſs'd up;
as a Warning to all ancient Perfons, who
ſhould dare to live longer than the young
Ones think convenient.</p>
            <p>It is well it has never been in the young
Ones Power, to bring in a Bill for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
trimming of Mankind, <hi>i. e.</hi> to knock
all ancient People on the Head.</p>
            <p>But though they are ſuffered to live, 'tis
under many Hardſhips and Reſtrictions,
many Humps and Grumps; and ſcarce a
Day, but they are ask'd, what they do out
of their Graves. This is a very common,
but withal, a moſt impious and unchriſtian
Saying; nay, not only unchriſtian, but even
unmahometan: For the very Infidels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
pay more Veneration to old Age,
than the Chriſtians do; to the Shame and
Scandal of our Holy Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Far be it from me, to tax all Chriſtians,
or all Children with ſo ſevere a Reproach.
No, I only blame thoſe who triumph
in the Strength of their Youth, and
ſnuff up their Noſtrils at <hi>Old-Age:</hi> Who
laugh at the Groanings of the hoary Head,
and have no Bowels of Compaſſion for the
Bowels that gave them Nouriſhment.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch ſelf-ſufficient Perſons conſider,
that it was once in their Parents Power to
have abandoned them, when they were more
helpleſs than any other Being to which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0038601100:14"/>
God had given Life. When they muſt
inevitably have periſhed, without great
Care and Tenderneſs: and indeed the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wiſdom is moſt manifeſtly ſeen, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man, the Chief of all his earthly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to require ſo delicate a Management,
and ſo tender a Nouriſhment: parental Love
being encreas'd by its Care, as filial Love
ought to be, by a Gratitude for that Care
it can never too much acknowledge or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay.</p>
            <p>All
Creatures whom God has ordained to
quit their Sires, or indeed thoſe whom he
has not endow'd with a rational Soul, to
diſtinguiſh between good and bad, or to
know Duty or Obligation, are eaſily brought
up, and can help themſelves better the
Hour they are born, than Man can in a
whole Year, nay in Years. They perform
all the neceſſary Functions of Life, and
there is no need of Education. Far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
is it with Man; he in his Infancy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a conſtant and careful Attendance,
his Members know not their Functions,
and it is a long while before he can feed
himſelf, even then his Parents have the Care
for his Food. When the Body is duly
nouriſhed, there is yet a further Care to
form the Mind, and cultivate the rational
Soul God had endow'd him with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0038601100:15"/>
Shall ſuch a Being, poſſeſt of a rational
Soul, to diſtinguiſh between Good and Bad,
between Gratitude and Ingratitude, ſo far
debaſe himſelf, or indeed become ſo
much a Brute, as to forſake his Parent, to
ſpurn him who begot him? or at leaſt, by
uſing him ill, to elbow him as it were out
of the World, to give himſelf the greater
Scope for Luxury?</p>
            <p>Yet how many do we ſee of ſuch? how
many truly compaſſionate Hearts daily
bleed, when they ſee the Son curbing the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or the Daughter ſnubbing the Mother?
It ſeems as if the Order of Nature were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted:
So ſhocking is it to any Soul who
has the leaſt Tincture of Humanity.</p>
            <p>I am ſure I ſpeak by Experience: for but
very lately I went to ſee an old School-Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and Acquaintance of mine, who had
lately married his Daughter, and ſettled
himſelf in her Family; accordingly he gave
me a general Invitation to come one Day or
other and take a Dinner with him; he had
been a Merchant from his Youth, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
liv'd in what we call high Life, had
travell'd much, and was Maſter of the moſt
good Manners I ever met with.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman being very weary, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
almoſt incapable of Buſineſs, thought it
beſt to leave off Houſe keeping, to marry his
Daughter, and ſettle in her Family. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0038601100:16"/>
he gave her his All for her
Portion, made her a Fortune of 12000
Pounds, and match'd her to an eminent
Merchant, who us'd the ſame Trade with
himſelf.</p>
            <p>During the Honey-Moon, and till the
Portion was paid, the Old Gentleman liv'd
in Clover; nothing was too hot or too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
for him. 'Twas <hi>Dear Sir! Dear Father!</hi>
at every Word; the Servants were ordered
to reſpect him, and he was in ſome Share
Maſter of the Family; but alas! he found
this but a ſhort-liv'd Dream, the Servants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to taunt at him, and he muſt call twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Times for a thing, before he could have
it. If he gently chid 'em, or reaſon'd with
them, they flew to their Miſtreſs, and made
twenty Stories about it: ſo that his Life
was in a manner a Burthen to him.</p>
            <p>I went in my Chariot to ſee him; and
had not the little Appearance I made, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
fome reſpect, I had danc'd Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
till they ſhould find in their Hearts
to call him. However, without much
Ceremony, they directed me up three pair
of Stairs, into a better ſort of a Garret;
there might be indeed ſome Lodging-Rooms
over Head for the Servants; but I have
ſeen many Servants have much better Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments:
but the Room would not
have ſo much ſurpriz'd me, had the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0038601100:17"/>
been any thing tollerable. I dare
ſwear it was as old as the Houſe, and had
no doubt paſs'd from Tenant to Tenant
half a ſcore Times.</p>
            <p>This I thought an odd Reſidence for my
Friend, but he ſeem'd contented; and I
ſaw no Reaſon I had to make him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
He amuſed me till Dinner time,
with ſhewing me his Books, and reading
ſome of his Verſes to me, as having a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Knack that way: he would have play'd
me a Leſſon on his Flute, but that he ſaid
it would diſturb his Daughter, who did not
love Muſick. I ſaw that all his little Arts
were only to beguile the Time, leſt a Whet
before Dinner, which I never miſt at his
Houſe, ſhould be expected; and which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
was now out of his Power to give. At
laſt the Bell rang, and he deſired me to walk
down to Dinner, but with an Air that
ſeem'd chidingly to ſay, Ah! why did you
not come ſooner, when I had more Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
However, with a long Apology to his
Son and Daughter, he introduced me; and
by pleading our long and intimate Acquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and the Obligations he was under to
me; he prevail'd on them at laſt to bid me
a very ceremonious Welcome. Excuſing
themſelves, as indeed they had need, that
they had not made a proper Proviſion; and
pleading their Ignorance of my coming,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0038601100:18"/>
accordingly down we ſate to, ſome cold
Roaſt-Beef, a few Herrings, and a Plate of
Fritters. Every thing was indeed very clean,
and we had Attendance enough, but never
in my Life made I a worſe Dinner. Herrings
are my averſion, I never eat cold Meat, judge
then what a Belly full I could make of my
ſhare of the Fritters. I happened by Miſtake
to call for a Glaſs of Wine, without which
I never dine, when the Gentleman told me
he had none in the Houſe; but if I pleas'd
he would ſend for ſome, recommending at
the ſame time ſome of his Home-brew'd
Ale, which I in Complaiſance could not
but accept in Preference to Wine. They
took me at my Word, and with much ado
I got down half a Glaſs of the worſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I ever took in my Life, but had the
Dinner been never ſo elegant, my indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would have ſpoil'd my Stomach; to
hear the Daughter at every turn, take up
her Father in his Diſcourſe, as if he had
been an Idiot or an underling, with <hi>Oh! fye
Sir,</hi> and <hi>I wonder Father you ſhould ſay ſo!</hi>
But leſt the Readers, by my Recital of the
Lady's Phraſes, ſhould think my Friend
ſpake ludicrouſly or indecently, I beg
Leave to aſſure them the contrary, and that
he is a Man of great Wit and ſtrict Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty.
Even the Son who was the leaſt Severe
upon him, could not refrain contradicting
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0038601100:19"/>
him every now and then, meerly for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
ſake, with, <hi>Pray, Sir, give me
Leave,</hi> and <hi>indeed, Sir, you have forgot your
ſelf;</hi> this was my whole Entertainment:
For my Part I ſaid little, but admired not
only at this wondrous Frugality, but the
ſurprizing Impertinence and Ingratitude of
of the young Couple. However, I was
undeceived at laſt, as I hope my Readers
will be when I aſſure them, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why <hi>Sir</hi> and <hi>Madam,</hi> eat ſo ſparingly
with us was, becauſe they had devour'd in
Hugger Mugger by themſelves, a good
handſome Fowl, and Oyſter Sauce, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd
with a Bottle of Wine, though they
could drink none in our Company.</p>
            <p>Seeing this penurious Management, and
the Awe my poor Friend was in, I thought
it beſt to adjourn to the Tavern to ſmoak a
Pipe, and withal to take a Glaſs to warm
my Stomach, which rak'd prodigiouſly. I
had before learn'd that the poor old Soul
had been oblig'd to leave off Smoaking,
becauſe forſooth his ſpitting and ſpawling
turn'd <hi>Madam</hi>'s Stomach; his ſmoaking
ſhe ſaid, made the Houſe ſtink, and damag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Furniture. He had been from his
Youth a great Smoaker, and this ſudden
Check, upon a Habit of ſo long ſtanding,
had very much impair'd his Health.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0038601100:20"/>
Accordingly to the Tavern we went; where
a Pipe and a Bottle gave new Life to my old
Acquaintance; he reſum'd his native Gayety;
and eleven of the Clock ſtole upon us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we could think of Parting, and even
then but with great Reluctance; ſo agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
did the Time paſs away in recounting
our old Adventures. Indeed our ſweet was
intermix'd with ſour, for his poor Heart was
ſo full, he could not contain himſelf from
lodging his Sorrows in the Boſom of his old
Friend. With Tears in his Eyes, he recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the Indignities he daily met with, not
only from his own Children, but from the
very Servants. If he ſpake to them as to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
his Daughter would take him up,
and tell him he domineer'd too much in
her Houſe: If he ſpake ſubmiſſively, he
was told he had no occaſion to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo little; inſomuch that he knew not
what Medium to take.</p>
            <p>He told me his Daughter had lately a
Chamber-Maid, who was the Daughter of
a decay'd Gentleman, and who having had
a tolerable Education, had imbib'd high
Notions of Virtue; and amongſt other
things, an Abhorrence of undutifulneſs in
Children, or indeed any diſreſpect in old
Age. This young Woman having learn'd
in what Faſhion my Friend had once liv'd,
could not without Indignation, ſee how ill
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0038601100:21"/>
he was treated: and being of a good Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
her ſelf, ſcorn'd to take Part with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Servants, to torment a poor old Man;
but on the contrary, would do him all the
Chriſtian Offices ſhe could, would conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
get him ſomething warm in a Morning,
and if he was out of Order at any time,
would tend him, and do him a thouſand
little Services, for which he in Recompence,
when her Lady was gone a Viſiting, would
read to the Girl a whole Afternoon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
while ſhe ſat at Work. And as ſo
many good Offices muſt conſequently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
her to him, eſpecially when every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
elſe had abandon'd him, he, with an
innocent Familiarity, us'd to call her his
<hi>Nanny:</hi> This was taken in great Dudgeon,
and the ſpiteful Servants improv'd it into an
Intrigue, and never left till poor <hi>Nanny</hi>
was turn'd away; and with her all the old
Man's Comfort; for he had no warm Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
now, if he was Sick, there he might
lie, for no body would help him; and as
for Attendance, they neglected him ſo
much, he was ſcarce clean, which drew
Tears from my Eyes, as knowing what a
neat old Man he was us'd to be. And but
for diſgracing his Children, he wiſh'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a thouſand Times in the <hi>Charter-Houſe,</hi>
or ſome other Place of publick Charity: I
diſſuaded him from ſuch Thoughts, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0038601100:22"/>
comforted him in the beſt Manner I could;
and ſo we both parted and ended our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Evening, with heavy Hearts and wet
Eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About a Week after, by the</hi> Penny-poſt<hi>,
I receiv'd the following Letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Dear Friend,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THOUGH I ſhall carry to my
Grave the agreeable Rememb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of ourlaſt Meeting, I believe I
ſhall ſuffer to my dying Day for that
Night's Pleaſure. Your engaging Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and my long Abſtinence from
Wine, made me, I think, drink a little
too much; and tho' not to diſguiſe my
ſelf, as you I hope might well perceive,
yet more than my Age and Weakneſs
cou'd well bear. My Daughter, who
ſeldom or never comes Home before
Midnight, took Care to be at Home that
very Night before Nine a-Clock; and
at Ten ſhe ſent all the Family to Bed,
and ſate up for me her ſelf, out of mere
Spight and pure Intention to rattle me
off; which ſhe did with a Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
crying out ſhame of ſuch Hours;
telling me I was drunk: and when I
complain'd of ſickneſs at my Stomach,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0038601100:23"/>
ſhe ſaid it was good enough for me.
This you may conclude made me worſe.
I thought I ſhould have died, and had
not I eas'd my Stomach, I had not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd
that Moment. This put her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all Patience, and inſtead of pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her almoſt Dying Father, ſhe called
me (would you believe it!) ſhe called
me <hi>Old Beaſt;</hi> and uſed me in ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as has riv'd my very Heart; Nor is
this all, for ever ſince I am become the
Jeſt of the whole Family: they call
me <hi>Old Fool,</hi> and <hi>drunken old Beaſt</hi>
to my Face, and every Viſitor that
comes in, is told what a Sot I am; ſo
that I keep my Chamber, and dare not
ſhow my Head about the Houſe; but I
thank God, who has heard my Prayers,
that I hourly find my ſelf weaker and
weaker, and I doubt not but my long wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Diſſolution is near at hand; for all the
Torments of a lingering Death are Trifles
to the Uſage I meet with. <hi>Dear Friend,</hi>
let me ſee you once more before I dye, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome Manuſcripts, and a few other
Trifles to give you in Remembrance of
our old Friendſhip; which alas! is all
I can give to the only Friend I have
left on this ſide the Grave.</p>
                  <closer>
                     <signed>Your Affectionate Friend.</signed>

            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0038601100:24"/>FOR the ſake of the young Lady, to
whom God grant a ſpeedy Repentance,
I forbear ſubſcribing even the initial Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of her Father's Name; that the World
may not know how good a Man ſhe has
murthered: For her Uſage was ſuch, that
before I could find Opportunity to viſit
him according to his Deſire, I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by a Ticket, which invited me to
hold up his Pall, which more ſurpriz'd
than afflicted me, as knowing the miſerable
Life, he lead under his moſt unnatural
Daughter.</p>
            <q>Quis talia fando temperet a Lachrymis?</q>
            <p>The burying was of a Piece with the
reſt; and I hope the whole will be a Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to all aged Perſons, and teach 'em to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
at leaſt wherewithal to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
elſewhere, in Caſe of the like Uſage
from their Children or Relations.</p>
            <p>I hope, at the ſame time, it will be a
Looking Glaſs to young People, eſpecially
thoſe guilty of the like Actions. If they
ſee any thing ugly in this Lady's Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
let them not be ſo over good natured
to their own Perſons, as to think what is
a Crime in her, may be excuſable in
themſelves: No, the Sin is the ſame, let
who will commit it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0038601100:25"/>
To do as we would be done by, one
would think a ſufficient Reſtraint upon any,
who would give themſelves the leaſt time to
conſider, that they in all probability may
be Fathers and Mothers; and that though
they are young and healthy now, they may
be old and feeble hereafter. Let them
therefore uſe the Old as they could wiſh to
be us'd when they are ſo, and let them
be as tender of their Parents, as they wou'd
have their Poſterity tender of them.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, we bring up our
Youth, as it were to deſpiſe us; and to our
ſhame be it ſpoken, make Rods for our
ſelves: Every one indulges his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and ſo all act with Impunity. Our
Youth are not half educated, nor are they
under any Reſtraint; we make Men and
Women of them too ſoon, and put 'em up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a footing with our ſelves, before they
have well learned good Manners, or indeed
any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>For good Manners does not altogether
conſiſt in a formal Courteſy or Bow, in
coming in and going out of a Room: No,
a Man may behave himſelf moſt punctually
Ceremonious at a Ball, a drawing Room,
a Tea-Table, or indeed in any other fiddle
faddle part of Life; and yet for all this be
but a Man of Clouts, a meer <hi>Sir-courtly-Nice.</hi>
I have very often ſeen ſome of theſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0038601100:26"/>
well dreſs'd, well bred Gentlemen, <hi>alias</hi>
Hobbydehoy's have Aſſurance enough to
ſtare a whole Coffee-Room out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
but neither Senſe or Learning
ſufficient to give any Man of Parts a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Anſwer.</p>
            <p>No, the Satchel is too ſoon taken from
the ſhoulders of our young ſparks, and the
Rod from their Backſides; the Tye-Wig
and Sword are too ſoon put on, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Maſter is made a Man before he
is a well-grown Child; our little Girls,
through the Indulgence of their Mothers,
are yet more forward, and put on woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Airs even at ten Years of Age. In a
Word, our Youth in general, are above
Correction; without Shame, too ripe, too
ignorant, and too impudent, and according
to the Poet.<q>
                  <l>Now little Miſs in Hanging-Sleeves knows
more</l>
                  <l>Than formerly her Grandame at three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore:</l>
                  <l>And Maſter who was lately whipt at School,</l>
                  <l>At bare thirteen ſets up for Rake and Fool,</l>
                  <l>Runs the whole Race of Vice with full
Career,</l>
                  <l>Is green and ripe and rotten in a Year.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0038601100:27"/>
Inſtead of Puerile Diverſions, our Boys
of 14 or 15 Years of Age go to Plays, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Members of Clubs, keep Hounds and
Horſes, and ſometimes follow worſe Game.
This is owing to the over Indulgence of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
who let them finger Money before
they know the Worth of it; and if a Stop
be not put to ſuch Practices in this Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the next may ſeverely repent it.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of Babies, Play-Things, and other
pretty Innocencies uſed of old, our Girls
at 10 or 11 Years of Age, keep their viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Days, have their ſelect Companies,
and treat 'em with as much Solemnity and
Expence, as their Parents do their own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance:
This prevails not only at
Court, but in the City; and I doubt not
but the Court Airs of the Mother, and the
womanly Airs of the Daughter, have made
Bankrupt many an honeſt Man, who had
not Courage enough to repel the Force of
this moſt prevailing, moſt pernicious
Cuſtom.</p>
            <p>This idle Cuſtom is not only very Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
but extreamly inconvenient withal;
for there is as much a Fuſs made at ſome
Houſes againſt ſuch a Miſs or ſuch a Miſs
comes to viſit the Daughter, as if a Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs
was expected. The Servants are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
from their other Buſineſs, and the
whole Houſe is in a Fluſter to receive
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0038601100:28"/>
Miſs's Viſitors forſooth. When the Viſit is
return'd, ſhe muſt be dreſs'd up to the heighth
of the Mode, and ſome new Thing or other
is always wanted: Not to mention Top-Knots,
Gloves, Coach-hire, and other una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
Expences.</p>
            <p>This is moſt criminal in thoſe who
cannot afford it; Such People would
therefore do well to reduce their Children
to the Old Standard; that is to ſay, make
Scholars of their Boys, and Houſewives
of their Girls: for the Education above
complain'd of, has ſpoil'd many a good
Tradeſman's Wife, and been the Ruin of
many a Family.</p>
            <p>I cannot cloſe this Diſcourſe, without
particularly cautioning the young Ladies
of this Age, how they Laugh, Fleer, and toſs
up their Noſes at ſober Matrons, and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
Ladies. Let 'em conſider, that thoſe
very Perſons were once young and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
as themſelves, if not more beautiful:
For to ſay truth, Tea, Drams, Wine,
and late Hours, have not a jot added
to the Beauty of the preſent Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Let
them again conſider, that their
own Mothers as well as themſelves, are
of the ſame Sex: That it is a foul Bird
bewrays its own Neſt; that the very
Infirmities they deride in thoſe Perſons,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0038601100:29"/>
are probably occaſioned by the bearing
and bringing up many Children; and that
the Wrinkles in their Faces are occaſioned
by their Care to ſupport ſuch giddy
brain'd Creatures as themſelves.</p>
            <p>But ſuch is the Ignorance and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the preſent Generation, that
young People look upon their Elders, as
upon a different Species, an inferiour Claſs
of People: They aſcribe no Merit to the
Virtue and Experience of Old Age, but
aſſume to themſelves the Preference in
all things. With them a Face and a good
Shape is Merit, a ſcornful toſs of the
Head, and deſpiſing every Body, but their
own dear ſelves is Wit, an everlaſting
Giddineſs, and an eternal Grin is Affabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and good Nature, fancy in Dreſs, is
Underſtanding, a ſupine Neglect of every
thing commendable Gentility; and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Punctilio in the greateſt Trifles, is
the Heighth of good Breeding.</p>
            <p>From this general Corruption in Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
proceeds all that may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
of in this preſent Age, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Evils may be expected in Generations
to come. But above all, nothing has more
contributed to this Corruption, than the
diſregard paid to Teachers and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
concern'd in the Education of Youth;
for the firſt and chief Step to the Ruin of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0038601100:30"/>
Youth, is when they have no Awe upon
'em, and are above Correction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spare the Rod and ſpoil the Child,</hi> is a
Sentence of ſo much Weight and Truth;
that no ſharper a Reprimand can be given
to thoſe Parents, who have ſtimulated in
their Children a Spirit of Pride, and taught
them to look contemptibly on their Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
The very Word <hi>Maſter</hi> or <hi>Miſtreſs</hi>
implies ſomething of Dominion; and as
Youth are committed to their Care, ſo they
ought to be ſubject to their Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>It ſhocks me when I ſee a Tutor in a
great Family, put upon a Footing with the
Servants; it makes his Pupil think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibly
of him, and is too great a Curb
on his Spirits, to let him deliver his
Inſtructions and Sentiments, in a manner
ſuitable to the Dignity of an Inſtructor.
And what is worſe, the little Deference
paid to him, begets in the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
a mean Opinion of and Indifference to
Learning it ſelf, ſeeing his Maſter reap ſo
little Advantage and Reſpect from it.</p>
            <p>It is the ſame Caſe in Schools, where
the Maſter's or Miſtreſs's paſſive and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
Temper makes them the Slaves of the
Scholars, whom they dare not correct, for
fear of looſing: Nothing being more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
now a days, than for Parents to
make it in their Bargain, that their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0038601100:31"/>
ſhall not be whipt, or otherwiſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
at School. Hence proceeds all that
Noiſe and Miſrule, which reigns in Schools,
ſtunning both Maſter and Scholars to
ſuch a Degree, that they can hardly hear
each other ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Parents therefore can blame none but
themſelves, if by theſe pernicious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
their Children grow in time to be
too many for them; nor can they with
any reaſon expect to find Duty and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
where they have not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated.
If they have countenanc'd, or
indulg'd their Children, in deriding the
hoary Head, are they to be pitied when
they reap ſeven Fold the Fruits of ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous
a Tillage? or to ſpeak more
plain, when it comes Home to themſelves.
Let every Perſon therefore make the Caſe
their own, when they ſee Children taunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and flouncing at their Parents, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
or Relations; mocking and deriding
People for Age and Infirmities, or indeed
any other bodily Misfortune, or Deformity;
upbraiding any for their Poverty, or crowing
over any Perſon, over whom they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to claim Preheminence. This domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering
way being now a days ſo preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
that Tradeſmen, Servants and other
Dependants, are generally more inſulted by
Children, than by Maſters and Miſtreſſes
themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0038601100:32"/>
To conclude, as we ſow we ſhall reap;
As we bring up our Children, ſo we may
expect to find them: If we educate them
in the Nurture and Fear of the Lord, in
an univerſal Benevolence to all Mankind,
void of all perſonal or Party Prejudice;
if we train them up to be dutiful to their
Parents, reſpectful to their Teachers, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly
to their Equals, and courteous to their
Inferiours; if we incite in 'em an Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Thirſt after Knowledge and other
liberal Acquirements; If we inſtil into 'em
early Principles of Humanity, Compaſſion
and Forbearance; and in a Word, all that
may inſpire to the higheſt Notions of
Honour, and carry human Nature to its
moſt exalted Pitch; then may we expect
to have Comfort in Old Age, from our
Grand Children, our Children and other
Relations; then may we conclude we
have laid a ſure Foundation for the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſucceeding Generations.</p>
            <p>But if on the contrary, we humour and
favour all their little Petulancies, and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
praiſing and indulging them, make
our ſelves contemptible in their Eyes; if
inſtead of correcting them in their Errors,
we arraign the Juſtice of Diſcipline, and
call it Severity; if we ſuffer them with
Impunity to fly in the Faces of their Parents
and Relations, to defy their Teachers, to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0038601100:33"/>
outvie their Equals, and inſult their Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours;
If we permit 'em to ſcoff at, and
turn to ridicule the Misfortunes and Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of others, and in a manner, ſuppreſs,
or at leaſt, not encourage in them any
Propenſity to Tenderneſs, but ſuffer their
Hearts to be hardned, and to know no
Pity: we muſt expect to have our Eyes
pluck'd out by thoſe we have brought up.
We muſt look for nothing in Old Age, but
Contempt, Oppreſſion, and all the Inſults
we have but too much reaſon to fear
from ſo inhuman a Generation.</p>

Thouſand Pounds be raiſed
between 50 Perſons, by an
equal Depoſite of four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Pounds each; which Stock
is to be veſted in themſelves only. For
this being no Charity, but rather a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partnerſhip,
there is no need of having any
Governor, Treaſurer, Director, or other
commanding Officer, but what may be
choſen among themſelves; and as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0038601100:34"/>
is their own, they are the fitteſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to keep it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That after they have obtained his

Corporate under what Name or Title they

deem proper; which Officers ſhall have
annual Rotation, and new ones be
choſen every year.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That inſtead of conſuming all, or a
great Part of the Stock in Building, which
would nip the Project in the Bud, they
ſhall rent a convenient Hall or Houſe in
Town or Country, at their own Option;
which Houſe muſt be equally divided into
Apartments: and to ſave another great
Expence, as well as to prevent Partiality,
or Diſguſt, 'tis fit that every Perſon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
their own Apartment, which Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
they may bequeath to whom they
pleaſe. For as all the Members of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
are to be upon an equal Footing,
'tis highly neceſſary there ſhould not be the
the leaſt Diſtinction among them in Diet,
Lodging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if one Perſon dreſſes
or furniſhes better than another, there
will be no need of Complaint, becauſe
they do it at their own Charge: Tho' to
ſpeak my Mind, it would look moſt love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0038601100:35"/>
to have a decent Equality and Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in Dreſs.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Kitchin, the Infirmary, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Offices, to be furniſhed at the common
Expence, but not to be taken out of the
Joint-Stock. On the contrary, every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to pay an equal Proportion, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
amount to above two Guineas a Head.
But in Caſe the Joint-Stock encreaſes, the
Money to be refunded.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That they call a Court among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as often as they ſhall think fit; at
which every Member ſhall have an equal
Vote; the Treaſurer taking the Chair. At
theſe Courts every thing ſhall be ſettled,
all Bargains made, all Accounts audited,
Servants hired or diſplac'd, the Diet,
and College Hours ſettled; and bye Laws
made or amended as Occaſion, or the
general Conſent ſhall point out.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. As all are to ſhare the Benefit, it
may readily be ſuppoſed that the beſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
will be made of the Money; but
above all that they will go on a ſure
Footing, and content themſelves with the
leſs Intereſt, upon the greater Security.
Tho' I muſt confeſs I know of no ſafer
and more profitable Method than to lend
Money on proper Depoſits; as Goods,
Merchandiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after the Manner of

                           <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0038601100:36"/>
This, or ſome ſuch ſure Method,
may bring in twenty <hi>per Cent.</hi> on their
Money, which will conſiderably encreaſe
their Capital, better their Proviſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and in time make them a very wealthy
Body. But in caſe no more than five
<hi>per Cent.</hi> Intereſt be produc'd from their
Capital of twenty Thouſand Pounds, it
will amount to one Thouſand Pounds <hi>per
