            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

appearance of formality on this ſpecies of military election, Sir William
Stanley brought a crown of ornament, which Richard wore in battle, 
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0429000101:8"/> and which had been found among the ſpoils; and he put it
on the head of the conqueror. Henry himſelf remained not in ſuſpenſe,
but immediately, without heſitation, accepted of the magnificent preſent,
which was tendered him. He was come to the great criſis of his fortune; and
being obliged ſuddenly to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelf, amidſt great difficulties,
which he muſt have frequently revolved in his mind, he choſe that party,
which his ambition ſuggeſted to him, and to which he ſeemed to be
conducted by his preſent proſperous ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His title to the crown.</note> THERE were
many titles, on which Henry could found his right to the throne; but no one of
them free from great objections, if conſidered, either with reſpect to
juſtice or to policy.</p>
               <p>DURING ſome years, Henry had been regarded as heir to the
houſe of Lancaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the party attached to that family; but the title of
the houſe of Lancaſter itſelf to the crown was generally eſteemed to be
very ill founded. Henry the fourth, who had firſt raiſed that family to
royal dignity, had never clearly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the foundation of his claim; and
while he plainly invaded the order of ſucceſſion, he had not acknowledged
the election of the people. The Parliament had indeed often recognized the
title of the Lancaſtrian princes; but theſe votes had little authority,
being conſidered as inſtances of prudent complaiſance towards a family in
poſſeſſion of preſent power: And they had accordingly been often
reverſed during the late prevalence of the houſe of York. Prudent men
alſo, who had been willing, for the ſake of peace, to ſubmit to any
eſtabliſhed authority, deſired not to ſee the claims of a family
revived, which muſt produce many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions at preſent, and which
disjointed for the future the whole ſyſtem of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary right. Beſides;
allowing the title of the houſe of Lancaſter to be legal, Henry himſelf
was not the true heir of that family; and nothing but the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of
faction, which never, without the utmoſt reluctance, will ſubmit to their
antagoniſts, could have engaged the partizans of that houſe to adopt the
earl of Richmond as their head. His mother indeed, Margaret, counteſs of
Richmond, was ſole daughter and heireſs of John duke of Somerſet,
grandſon to John of Gaunt duke of Lancaſter: But the birth of the firſt
of the Somerſet line was itſelf illegitimate and even adulterous. And tho'
the duke of Lancaſter had obtained the legitimation of his natural children
by a patent of Richard the ſecond, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in Parliament; it might
juſtly be doubted, whether this Deed could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow any title to the Crown;
ſince in the patent itſelf all the privileges conferred by it are fully
enumerated, and the ſucceſſion to the kingdom, by being omitted, is
thereby tacitly excluded. In all the ſettlements of the crown, made during
the reigns of the Lancaſtrian princes, the line of Somerſet had been
entirely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked; and it was not till the failure of the legitimate branch,
that men had paid any attention to their claim. And to add to the general
diſſatisfaction againſt <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0429000101:9"/> Henry's title, his mother,
from whom he derived all his right, was ſtill alive; and evidently preceded
him in the order of ſucceſſion.</p>
               <p>THE title of the houſe of York, both from the plain reaſon
of the caſe, and from the late popular government of Edward the fourth, had
obtained uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally the preference in the ſentiments of the people; and
Henry might engraft his claim on the right of that family, by his intended
marriage with the princeſs Elizabeth, the heireſs of it; a marriage, which
he had ſolemnly promiſed to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate, and to the expectation of which he
had chiefly owed all his paſt ſucceſſes. But many reaſons di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>waded Henry from adopting this expedient. Were he to
receive the crown only in right of his ſpouſe, his power, he knew, would be
very limited; and he muſt expect rather to enjoy the bare title of king by a
ſpecies of courteſy, than poſſeſs the real authority which belongs to
it. Should the princeſs die before him without iſſue, he muſt deſcend
from the throne, and give place to the next in ſucceſſion: And even, if
his bed ſhould be bleſt with offspring, it ſeemed dangerous to expect,
that filial piety in his children would prevail over the ambition of obtaining
preſent poſſeſſion of regal power. An act of Parliament, indeed,
might be eaſily procured to ſettle the crown on him during his life, but
Henry knew how much ſuperior the claim of ſucceſſion by blood was to
the votes of an aſſembly<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon in Kennet's compleat
Hiſtory, p. 579.</note>, which had always been overborne by violence in the
ſhock of contending titles, and which had ever been more governed by the
conjunctures of the times, than by any conſiderations derived from reaſon
or public intereſt.</p>
               <p>THERE was yet a third foundation, on which Henry might reſt
his claim, the right of conqueſt, by his victory over Richard, the preſent
poſſeſſor of the crown. But beſides that Richard himſelf was deemed
no better than an uſurper, the army, which fought againſt him,
conſiſted chiefly of Engliſhmen; and a right of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over England
could never be eſtabliſhed by ſuch a victory. Nothing alſo would give
greater umbrage to the nation than a claim of this nature; which might be
conſtrued as an abolition of all their rights and privileges, and the
eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of deſpotic authority in the ſovereign<note n="†" place="bottom">Bacon, p. 579.</note>. William himſelf, the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, tho' at the
head of a powerful and victorious army of foreigners, had at firſt declined
the invidious title of conqueror; and it was not till the full
eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of his authority that he had ventured to advance ſo
violent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive a pretenſion.</p>
               <p>BUT Henry knew, that there was another foundation of authority,
ſomewhat reſembling the right of conqueſt, to wit, preſent
poſſeſſion; and that this title, guarded by vigour and ability, would
be ſufficient to ſecure perpetual poſſeſſion of the throne. He had
before him the example of Henry the fourth; who, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by no better
pretenſion, had ſubdued many inſurrections, and had at laſt 
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0429000101:10"/> been able to tranſmit the crown peaceably to his
poſterity. He was ſenſible, that this title, which had been perpetuated
thro' three ſucceſſions of the family of Lancaſter, might ſtill have
ſubſiſted, notwithſtanding the preferable claim of the houſe of York;
had not the ſcepter devolved into the hands of Henry the ſixth, which were
too feeble to ſuſtain it. Inſtructed by theſe recent experiences,
Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was determined to put himſelf in preſent poſſeſſion of regal
authority; and to ſhow all oppoſers, that nothing but force of arms and a
ſucceſsful war would be able to expel him. His claim as heir to the houſe
of Lancaſter he was reſolved to advance; and never allow it to be
diſcuſſed: And he hoped that this title, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the partizans of
that family, and ſeconded by preſent power, would ſecure him a perpetual
and an independant authority.</p>
               <p>THESE views of Henry are not expoſed to much blame; becauſe
founded on good policy, and even on a ſpecies of neceſſity: But there
entered into all his meaſures and councils another motive, which admits not
of the ſame apology. 
<note place="margin">King's preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt the houſe of
York.</note> The violent contentions, which, during ſo long a period, had
been maintained between the rival families of York and Lancaſter, and the
many ſanguinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges which they had mutually exerciſed on each other,
had inflamed the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite factions into a high pitch of animoſity. Henry
himſelf, who had ſeen moſt of his near friends and relations periſh in
the field or on the ſcaffold, and who had been expoſed in his own perſon
to many hardſhips and dangers, had imbibed a violent antipathy to the York
party, which no time nor experience were ever able to efface. Inſtead of
embracing the preſent happy opportunity of aboliſhing theſe fatal
diſtinctions, of uniting his title with that of his ſpouſe, and of
beſtowing favour indifferently on the friends of both families; he carried
into the throne all the partialities which belong to the head of a faction, and
even the paſſions, which are carefully guarded againſt by every true
politician in that ſituation. To exalt the Lancaſtrian party, to depreſs
the retainers of the houſe of York, were ſtill the favourite objects of his
purſuit; and thro' the whole courſe of his reign, he never forgot theſe
early prepoſſeſſions. Incapable from his natural temper of a more
enlarged and more benevolent ſyſtem of policy, he expoſed himſelf to
many preſent inconveniencies, by too anxiouſly guarding againſt that
future poſſible event, which might disjoin his title from that of the
princeſs, whom he eſpouſed. And while he treated the Yorkiſts as
enemies, he ſoon ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them ſuch, and taught them to diſcuſs that
right to the crown, which he ſo carefully kept ſeparate; and to perceive
its weakneſs and invalidity.</p>
               <p>TO theſe paſſions of Henry, as well as to his
ſuſpicious politics, we are to aſcribe the meaſure, which he embraced
two days after the battle of Boſworth. Edward Plantagenet, earl of Warwic,
ſon to the unfortunate duke of Clarence, was detained in a ſpecies of
conſinement at Sherif-Hutton in Yorkſhire by the <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0429000101:11"/>
jealouſy of his uncle, Richard; whoſe title to the throne was inferior to
that of the young prince. Warwic had now reaſon to expect better treatment,
as he was no obſtacle to the ſucceſſion either of Henry or Elizabeth;
and from a boy of ſuch tender years no danger could reaſonably be
apprehended. But Sir Robert Willoughby was diſpatched by Henry with orders to
take him from Sherif-Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, to convey him to the Tower, and to retain him in
cloſe cuſtody<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon, p. 579. Polydore Virgil, p.
565.</note>. The ſame meſſenger carried directions, that the princeſs
Elizabeth, who had been confined to the ſame place, ſhould be conducted to
London, in order to meet Henry, and there celebrate her eſpouſals.</p>
               <p>HENRY himſelf ſet out for the capital, and advanced by
ſlow journies. Not to rouſe the jealouſy of the people, he took care to
avoid all appearance of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary triumph; and ſo to reſtrain the
inſolence of victory, that every thing about him bore the appearance of an
eſtabliſhed monarch, making a peaceable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs thro' his dominions,
rather than of a prince who had opened a way to the throne by force of arms. 
<note place="margin">His joyful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in London.</note> The
acclamations of the people were every whereloud, and no leſs ſincere and
hearty. Beſides the favour, naturally attending a young and victorious prince
on his acceſſion, the nation promiſed themſelves great felicity from
the new ſcene, which opened before them. During the courſe of near a whole
century the kingdom had been laid waſte by domeſtic wars and convulſions;
and if at any time the noiſe of arms had ceaſed, the ſound of faction and
diſcontent ſtill threatened new diſorders. Henry, by his marriage with
Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, ſeemed to enſure an union of the contending titles of their
families; and having prevailed over a hated tyrant, who had anew disjointed the
ſucceſſion even of the houſe of York, and filled his own family with
blood, an unfeigned favour was obſerved every where to attend him. Numerous
and ſplendid troops of gentry and nobility accompanied his progreſs. The
mayor and companies of London received him as he approached the city: The
crouds of people and citizens were zealous in their expreſſions of
ſatisfaction. But Henry, amidſt theſe general effuſions of joy,
diſcovered ſtill the ſtatelineſs and reſerve of his temper, which
made him ſcorn to court popularity: He entered London in a cloſe chariot,
and gratified not the people with the ſight of their new monarch. He went
firſt to St. Paul's church, where he offered up the ſtandards, taken in the
field of battle; and ſung oriſons for the victory, which he had there
obtained. He departed thence to the biſhop of London's palace, where lodgings
were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him.</p>
               <p>BUT Henry did not ſo much neglect the favour of the people, as
to delay giving them aſſurance of his marriage with the princeſs
Elizabeth, which he <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0429000101:12"/> knew to be ſo paſſionately
deſired by the whole nation. On his leaving Britanny, he had artificially
dropt ſome hopes, that, if he ſhould ſucceed in his enterprize, and
obtain the crown of England, he would eſpouſe Anne, the heireſs of that
dutchy; and the report of this engagement had already reached England, and had
begot anxiety in the people, and even in the princeſs Elizabeth herſelf.
Henry took care to diſſipate theſe apprehenſions, by ſolemnly
renewing, before the council and principal nobility, the promiſe, which he
had already given, to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate his marriage with Elizabeth. 
<note place="margin">His corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> But tho' bound by
honour, as well as intereſt, to compleat this alliance, he was reſolved to
poſtpone it, till the ceremony of his own coronation ſhould be finiſhed,
and till his title ſhould be recognized by the Parliament. Anxious ſtill to
ſupport his perſonal and hereditary right to the throne, he dreaded leſt
a preceding marriage with the princeſs ſhould imply a participation of
ſovereignty in her, and raiſe doubts of his own title by the houſe of
Lancaſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sweating ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> THERE raged at
that time in London, and other parts of the kingdom, a ſpecies of Malady,
unknown to any other age or nation, the Sweating ſickneſs, which
occaſioned a ſudden death to great multitudes; tho' it was not propagated
by any contagious infection, but aroſe from the general diſpoſition of
the air and of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body. In leſs than twenty-four hours the patient
commonly died or recovered; but when the peſtilence had committed ravages for
a few weeks, it was obſerved, either from alterations in the air, or from a
more proper regimen, which was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, to be conſiderably abated<note n="*" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil, p. 567.</note>. Preparations were then made
for the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of Henry's coronation. In order to heighten the ſplendor of
that appearance, he beſtowed the rank of knights banneret on twelve
perſons; and he conferred peerages on three. Jaſper earl of Pembroke, his
uncle, he created duke of Bedford; Thomas lord Stanley, his father-in-law, earl
of Darby; and Edward Courteney, earl of Devonſhire. 
<note place="margin">30th of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober.</note> At the coronation
likewiſe there appeared a new inſtitution, which the king had
eſtabliſhed for ſecurity as well as pomp, a band of fifty archers, who
were denominated yeomen of the guard. But leſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould take
umbrage at this unuſual ſymptom of jealouſy in the prince, as if it
implied a perſonal diffidence of his ſubjects, he declared the
inſtitution to be perpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">A Parliament.</note> THE Parliament being
aſſembled at Weſtminſter, the majority immediately appeared to be
devoted partizans of Henry; all perſons of another diſpoſition, either
declining to ſtand in theſe dangerous times, or being obliged to
diſſemble their principles and inclinations. The Lancaſtrian party had
every where been <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0429000101:13"/> ſucceſsful in the elections; and even
many of them had been returned knights and burge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

had been expoſed to the rigour of the law, and been condemned by ſentence
of attainder or outlawry. Their right to take ſeats in the houſe being
queſtioned, the caſe was referred to all the judges, who aſſembled in
the Exchequer Chamber, in order to deliberate on ſo delicate a ſubject. The
ſentence pronounced was very prudent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a juſt temperament
between law and expediency<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon, p. 581.</note>. They
determined, that the members attainted ſhould forbear taking their ſeats
till an act were paſſed for the reverfal of their attainder. There was no
difficulty of obtaining this act; and in it were comprehended an hundred and
ſeven perſons of the King's party<note n="†" place="bottom">Rot. Parl.
1 Hen. VII. n. 2, 3, 4.—15, 17, 26-65.</note>!</p>
               <p>BUT a difficulty was ſtarted of a nature ſtill more
important. The King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had been attainted; and his right of
ſucceſſion to the crown might thence be expoſed to ſome doubt. The
judges extricated themſelves from this dangerous queſtion, by a ſingular
poſition, which they eſtabliſhed; 
<q rend="inline">"That the crown takes away all defects and
ſtops in Blood; and that from the time the King aſſumed royal authority,
the fountain was cleared, and all attainders and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of blood
diſcharged<note n="‡" place="bottom">Bacon, p 581.</note>."</q>
Beſides the urgent neceſſity of the caſe, which admitted of no
deliberation; the judges probably thought, that no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a court of
judicature ought to bar the right of ſucceſſion; that the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of
a King towards his heir might readily occaſion ſtretches of law and
juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice againſt him; and that a prince might even be engaged in
unjuſtifiable meaſures during his predeceſſor's reign, without meriting
on that account to be excluded from the throne, which was his birth-right.</p>
               <p>WITH a Parliament ſo obſequious as the preſent, the King
could not fail to obtain whatever act of ſettlement he was pleaſed to
require. He ſeems only to have entertained ſome doubts within himſelf on
what title he ſhould found his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions. In his firſt addreſs
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the Parliament he mentioned his
juſt title by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary right: But leſt that title ſhould not be
eſteemed ſufficient, he ſubjoined his claim by the judgment of God, who
had given him victory over his enemies in the field of battle. And again,
leſt this pretenſion ſhould be interpreted as aſſuming a right of
conqueſt, he enſured his ſubjects in the entire enjoyment of their former
properties and poſſeſſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Entail of the crown.</note> THE entail of the
crown was drawn, according to the ſenſe of the King, and probably in the
words, dictated by himſelf. He made no mention in it of the princeſs
Elizabeth, nor any branch of the family of York; but in other reſpects the
act was compoſed with ſufficient reſerve and moderation. He did not
inſiſt, that it ſhould contain a declaration or recognition of his
preceding right; as on <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0429000101:14"/> the other hand, he avoided the
appearance of a new law or ordinance. He choſe a middle courſe, which, as
is commonly unavoidable in ſuch caſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely free from
uncertainty and obſcurity. It was voted, 
<q rend="inline">"That the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the crown ſhould
reſt, remain, and abide in the King<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon, p.
581.</note>;"</q> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as rightful heir, or only as preſent
poſſeſſor, was not determined. In like manner, the King was contented
that the ſucceſſion ſhould be ſecured to the heirs of his body; but
he pretended not, in caſe of their failure, to exclude the houſe of York,
or give the preference to that of Lancaſter: He left that great point
ambiguous for the preſent; and truſted, that, if ever its determination
ſhould become requiſite, future incidents would open the way for the
deciſion.</p>
               <p>BUT after all theſe precautions, the King was ſo little
ſatisfied with his own title to the crown, that, in the following year, he
applied to Rome for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it; and as that court gladly laid hold
of all opportunities, which the imprudence, weakneſs, or neceſſities of
princes afford it to extend its autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Innocent the eighth, the reigning
pope, readily granted a bull, in whatever terms the King was pleaſed to
deſire. All Henry's titles, by ſucceſſion, marriage, parliamentary
choice, even conqueſt, are there enumerated; and to the whole the ſanction
of religion is added; excommunication is denounced againſt every one who
ſhould either diſturb him in the preſent poſſeſſion, or the heirs
of his body in their future ſucceſſion to the crown; and from this
penalty, no criminal, except in the article of death, can be abſolved but by
the pope himſelf, or his ſpecial commiſſioners. It is difficult to
imagine, that the ſecurity derived from this bull, could be a compenſation
for the defect which it betrayed in Henry's title, and to the danger of thus
inviting the pope to interpoſe in theſe concerns.</p>
               <p>IT was natural, and even laudable in Henry to reverſe the
attainders, which had paſſed againſt the partizans of the houſe of
Lancaſter: But the revenges, which he exerciſed againſt the retainers of
the York family, to which he was ſo ſoon to be allied, cannot be
conſidered in the ſame light. Yet the Parliament, at his inſtigation,
paſſed an act of attainder againſt the late King himſelf, againſt the
duke of Norfolk, the earl of Surrey, viſcount Lovel, the lords Zouche and
Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rars of Chartley, Sir Walter and
Sir James Harrington, Sir William Berkeley, Sir Humphrey Stafford, Cateſby,
and about twenty other gentlemen, who had fought on Richard's ſide in the
battle of B ſworth. How men could be guilty of treaſon, by ſupporting the
King in poſſeſſion againſt the earl of Richmond, who aſſumed not
the title of King, it was not eaſy to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and nothing but a ſervile
complaiſance in the Parliament could have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged them to make this
ſtretch of juſtice. Nor was it a ſmall mortification to 
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0429000101:15"/> the people in general, to find, that the King, prompted
either by avarice or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, could, in the very beginning of his reign,
ſo far violate the cordial union, which had been previouſly concerted
between the parties, and to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of which he had plainly owed his
acceſſion to the throne.</p>
               <p>THE King, having gained ſo many points of conſequence from
his Parliament, thought it not expedient to demand any ſupply from them,
which the profound peace enjoyed by the nation, and the late forfeitures of
Richard's adherents, ſeemed to render ſomewhat ſuperfluous. 
<note place="margin">10th of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</note> The Parliament,
however, conferred on him during life the duty of tonnage and poundage, which
had been enjoyed in the ſame manner by ſome of his immediate predec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſors; and they added, before they
broke up, other lucrative bills of no great moment. The King, on his part, made
ſome returns of grace and favour to his people. He publiſhed his royal
proclamation, offering pardon to all ſuch as had taken arms, or formed any
attempts againſt him; provided they ſubmitted themſelves to mercy by a
certain day, and took the uſual oath of fealty and allegiance. Upon this
proclamation many came out of their ſanctuaries, and the minds of men were
every where much quieted. Henry choſe to take wholly to himſelf the merit
of an act of grace, ſo agreeable to the nation; rather than communicate it
with the Parliament, (as was his firſt intention) by paſſing a bill to
that purpoſe. The earl of Surrey, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, tho' he had ſubmitted, and
delivered himſelf into the King's hands, was ſent priſoner to the
tower.</p>
               <p>DURING this parliament, the King alſo beſtowed favours and
honours on ſome particular perſons, who were attached to him. Edward
Stafford, eldeſt ſon to the duke of Buckingham, forfeited in the late
reign, was reſtored to all the honours of his family, as well as to all its
fortune, which was very ample. This genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, ſo unuſual in Henry, was
the effect of his gratitude to the memory of Buckingham, who had firſt
concerted the plan of his ſucceſſion to the crown, and who by his own
ruin had made way for that great event. Chandos of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanny was created earl
of Bath, Sir Giles Daubeny lord Daubeny, and Sir Robert Willoughby lord Broke.
Theſe were all the titles of nobility, conferred by the King<note n="*" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil, p. 566.</note>.</p>
               <p>BUT the miniſters, whom the King moſt truſted and
favoured, were not choſen from among the nobility, or even from among the
laity. John Morton, and Richard Fox, two clergymen, perſons of induſtry,
vigilance, and capacity, were the men to whom he moſt confided his affairs
and ſecret councils. They had ſhared with him all his former dangers and
diſtreſſes; and he now forgot not to make them participate in his good
fortune. They were both called to the privy <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0429000101:16"/> council; and
Morton was created biſhop of Ely, Fox of Exeter. The former ſoon after,
upon the death of Bourchier, was raiſed to the ſee of Canterbury. The
latter was made lord privy ſeal; and ſucceſſively, biſhop of Bath and
Wells, Durham, and Wincheſter. For Henry, as lord Bacon obſerves, loved to
employ and advance prelates, becauſe, having rich biſhoprics to beſtow,
it was eaſy for him to reward their ſervices: And it was his maxim to
raiſe them by ſlow ſteps, and make them firſt paſs thro' the inferior
biſhoprics<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon, p. 582. Bacon adds, that the King's
reaſon for theſe gradual promotions, was in order to enjoy the more firſt
fruits; not reflecting that theſe belonged not to the crown, till after the
reformation.</note>. He probably expected, that as they were naturally more
dependant on him than the nobility, who, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that age, enjoyed
poſſeſſions and juriſdictions dangerous to royal authority; ſo the
proſpect of ſome farther elevation would render them ſtill more active in
his ſervice, and more obſequious to his commands.</p>

                  <note place="margin">18th of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</note> IN preſenting the
bill of tonnage and poundage, the Parliament, anxious topreſerve the true and
undiſputed ſucceſſion to the crown, had petitioned Henry, with
demonſtrations of the greateſt earneſtneſs, to eſpouſe the
princeſs Elizabeth; but they covered their real reaſon under the dutiful
pretence of their deſire to have heirs of his body. He now thought in
earneſt of ſatisfying the minds of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in that particular. 
<note place="margin">King's mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> His marriage was
celebrated at London; and that with greater appearance of univerſal joy, than
either his firſt entry or his coronation. Henry remarked with much
diſpleaſure this general favour which was borne the houſe of York. The
ſuſpicions, which aroſe from it, not only diſturbed his tranquillity
during his whole reign; but bred diſguſt towards his ſpouſe herſelf,
and poyſoned all his domeſtic enjoyments. Tho' virtuous, amiable, and
obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious to the laſt degree, ſhe never met with a proper return of
affection, or even of complaiſance from her huſband; and the malignant
ideas of faction ſtill, in his ſullen mind, prevailed over all the
ſentiments of conjugal tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>THE King had been carried along with ſuch a tide of
ſucceſs ever ſince his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in England, that he thought nothing could
withſtand the fortune, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which attended him. He now reſolved
to make a progreſs into the North, where the friends of the houſe of York,
and even the partizans of Richard were moſt numerous; in hopes of curing, by
his preſence and converſation, the prejudices of the malecontents. When he
arrived at Nottingham, he heard that viſcount Lovel, with Sir Humphry
Stafford and Thomas, his brother, had withdrawn themſelves ſecretly from
their ſanctuary at Colcheſter: But this news appeared not to him of ſuch
importance as to ſtop his journey; and he proceeded forward to York. 
<note place="margin">An inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> He there heard,
that the Staffords had levied an army in the <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0429000101:17"/> county of
Worceſter, and were approaching to beſiege that city: And that Lovel, at
the head of an army of three or four thouſand men, was marching to attack him
in York. Henry was not diſmayed with this intelligence. His active cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
full of reſources, immediately prompted him to find the proper remedy. Tho'
he knew himſelf to be ſurrounded with enemies in theſe diſaffected
counties, he aſſembled a ſmall body of troops, in whom he could confide;
and he put them under the command of the duke of Bedford. He joined to them all
his own at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants; but he found that this haſty armament was more
formidable by their ſpirit and their zealous attachment to him, than by the
arms or military ſtores of which they were provided. He therefore gave
Bedford orders not to approach the enemy; but previouſly to try every proper
expedient to diſſipate them. Bedford publiſhed a general promiſe of
pardon to the rebels, which had a greater effect on their leader than on his
followers. Lovel, who had undertaken an enterprize, that exceeded his courage
and capacity, was ſo terrified with the fears of deſertion among his
troops, that he ſuddenly withdrew himſelf, and, after lurking ſome time
in Lancaſhire, he made his eſcape into Flanders, where he was protected by
the dutcheſs of Burgundy. His army ſubmitted to the King's clemency; and
the other inſurgents, hearing of this ſucceſs, raiſed the ſiege of
Worceſter, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed themſelves. The Staffords took ſanctuary in
the church of Colnham, a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage near Abingdon; but as it was found, that that
church had not the privilege of giving protection to rebels, they were taken

                  <note place="margin">20th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember.</note> HENRY'S joy for
this ſucceſs was followed, ſome time after, with the birth of a prince,
to whom he gave the name of Arthur, in memory of the famous Britiſh King of
that name, from whom, it was pretended, the family of Tudor derived their
deſcent.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Diſcontents of the people.</note> THO'
Henry had been able to diſſipate that haſty rebellion, which was raiſed
by the relicts of Richard's parrizans, his government was become in general
very unpopular: The ſource of the public diſcontent aroſe chiefly from
his preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt the houſe of York, which was univerſally beloved
by the nation, and which, for that very reaſon, became every day more the
object of his hatred and jealouſy. Not only a preference on all occaſions,
it was obſerved, was given to the Lancaſtrians; but many of the oppoſite
party had been expoſed to great ſeverity, and had been bereaved of their
fortunes by acts of attainder. A general reſumption likewiſe had paſſed
of all grants made by the princes of the houſe of York; and tho' this rigour
had been covered under the pretence, that the revenue <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0429000101:18"/> was
become inſufficient to ſupport the crown, and tho' the liberalities, during
the latter years of Henry the ſixth, were reſumed by the ſame law, yet
the York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>party, as they were the principal ſufferers by the reſumption,
thought it chiefly levelled againſt them. The ſeverity, exerciſed
againſt the earl of Warwic, begot compaſſion towards youth and innocence,
expoſed to ſuch oppreſſion; and his confinement in the tower, the very
place where Edward's children had been mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by their uncle, made the
public expect a like cataſtrophe for him, and led them to make a compariſon
between Henry and that deteſted tyrant. And when it was remarked, that the
queen herſelf met with harſh treatment, and even after the birth of a
ſon, was not admitted to the honour of a public coronation, Henry's
prepoſſeſſions were then concluded to be abſolutely incurable, and
men became equally obſtinate in their diſguſt againſt his government.
Nor was the manner and addreſs of the King calculated to cure theſe
prejudices contracted againſt his adminiſtration; but had, in every thing,
a tendency to promote fear, or at beſt reverence, rather than good will and
affection<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon, p. 583.</note>. And while the high
idea, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of his policy and vigour, retained the nobility and men of
character in obedience; the effects of his unpopular government ſoon appeared
in the public, by incidents of a very extraordinary nature.</p>
               <p>THERE lived in Oxford, one Richard Simon, a prieſt, who
poſſeſſed ſome ſubtlety, and ſtill more boldneſs and temerity.
This man had entertained the deſign of diſturbing Henry's government, by
raiſing up a pretender to his crown; 
<note place="margin">Lambert Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.</note> and for that
purpoſe, he caſt his eyes on Lambert Simnel, a youth of fifteen years of
age, who was ſon of a baker, and who, being endowed with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
above his years, and addreſs above his condition, ſeemed well fitted to
perſonate a prince of royal extraction. A report had been ſpread among the
peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and received with great avidity, that Richard, duke of York, ſecond
ſon to Edward the fourth, had, by a ſecret eſcape, ſaved himſelf from
his uncle's cruelty, and lay ſomewhere concealed in England. Simon, taking
advantage of this rumour, had at firſt inſtructed his pupil to aſſume
that name, which he found to be ſo fondly cheriſhed by the public: But
hearing afterwards a new report, that Warwic had made his eſcape from the
tower, and obſerving that this news was attended with no leſs general
ſatisfaction, he changed the plan of his impoſture, and made Simnel
perſonate that unfortunate prince<note n="†" place="bottom">Polydore
Virgil, p. 569, 570.</note>. Tho' the youth was qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified by nature for the
part which he was inſtructed to act; yet was it remarked, that he was better
informed in circumſtances relating to the royal family, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in
the adventures of the earl of Warwic, than he could be ſuppoſed to have
learned from one of Simon's condition: And it was thence conjectured, that 
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0429000101:19"/> perſons of higher rank, partizans of the houſe of
York, had laid the plan of this conſpiracy, and had conveyed proper
inſtructions to the actors. The queen dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager herſelf was expoſed to
great ſuſpicion; and it was indeed the general opinion, however unlikely it
might ſeem, that ſhe had ſecretly given her conſent to this
impoſture. This woman was of a very reſtleſs diſpoſition. That
character of ambition and intrigue, which ſhe had betrayed during the reign
of her huſband, had not abandoned her during the uſurpation of Richard; and
in her cloſet was firſt laid the plan of that great confederacy, which
overturned the throne of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and raiſed the earl of Richmond to
royal dignity. Finding, that, inſtead of receiving the reward of theſe
ſervices, ſhe herſelf was fallen to abſolute inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificance, her
daughter treated with ſeverity, and all her friends brought under
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, ſhe had conceived the moſt violent animoſity againſt
Henry, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make him feel the effects of her reſentment.
The impoſtor, ſhe knew, however ſucceſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ful, it would be eaſy at laſt to ſet aſide; and if a way
could be found at his riſque to ſubvert the King's government, ſhe hoped
that a ſcene would be opened, which, tho' difficult at preſent exactly to
foreſee, would gratify her revenge, and be on the whole leſs irkſome to
her than that ſlavery and contempt, to which ſhe was reduced<note n="*" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil, p. 570.</note>.</p>
               <p>BUT whatever care Simon might take to convey inſtruction to
his pupil, Simnel, he knew, that the impoſture would not bear a cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe inſpection; and he was
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determined to open the firſt public ſcene of it in Ireland. That
iſland, which was zealouſly attached to the houſe of York, and bore an
affectionate regard to the memory of Clarence, Warwick's father, who had been
their lieutenant, was improvidently allowed by Henry to remain in the ſame
condition, in which he found it; and all the councellors and officers, who had
been appointed by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, ſtill retained their authority. No
ſooner did Simnel preſent himſelf to Thomas Fitzgerald, earl of Kildare,
the deputy, and claim his protection, as the unfortunate Warwic, than that
credulous nobleman, not ſuſpecting ſo bold a fiction, lent attention to
him, and began to conſult ſome perſons of rank with regard to this
extraordinary incident. Theſe he found even more ſanguine in their zeal and
belief than himſelf: And in proportion a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the ſtory diffuſed itſelf among thoſe of lower
condition, it became the object of ſtill higher paſſion and credulity;
till the people in Dublin with one conſent tendered their allegiance to
Simnel as to the true Plantagenet. 
<note place="margin">Revolt of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> Fond of a novelty,
which flattered their natural propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they overlooked the daughters of
Edward the fourth, who ſtood before Warwic in the order of Succeſſion;
they payed the pretended prince attendance as their ſovereign, lodged him in
the caſtle of Dublin, crowned him with a diadem taken from a ſtatue of the
virgin, and publicly proclaimed him King, under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation 
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0429000101:20"/> of Edward the ſixth. The whole iſland followed the
example of the capital; and not a ſword was any where drawn in Henry's
quarrel.</p>
               <p>WHEN this intelligence was conveyed to Henry, it reduced him to
ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity. Determined always to face his enemies in perſon, he yet
ſcrupled at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to leave England, where he ſuſpected the
conſpiracy was firſt framed, and where, he knew, many perſons of
condition, and the people in general were much diſpoſed to lend it
countenance. In order to diſcover the ſecret ſource of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,
and take meaſures againſt this open revolt, he held frequent
conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with his miniſters and counſellors, and laid plans for a
vigorous defence of his authority, and the ſuppreſſion of his
enemies.</p>
               <p>THE firſt event, which followed theſe deliberations, gave
great ſurprize to the public: It was the ſeizure of the queen dowager, the
forfeiture of all her lands and revenue, and the cloſe confinement of her
perſon to the nunnery of Bermon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſey. So arbitrary and violent an act of
authority was covered with a very thin pretence. It was alledged, that,
notwithſtanding the ſecret agreement to marry her daughter to Henry, ſhe
had yet yielded to the ſollicitations and menaces of Richard, and delivered
that princeſs and her ſiſters into the hands of the tyrant. This crime,
which was now become obſolete, and might admit of many allevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was
therefore ſuſpected not to be the real cauſe of the ſeverity, with
which ſhe was treated; and men believed, that the King, unwilling to accuſe
ſo near a relation of a conſpiracy againſt him, had cloaked his vengeance
or precaution under the pretext of an offence, known to the whole world<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon, p. 583. Polydore Virgil, p. 571.</note>. They were
after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the more confirmed in this ſuſpicion, when they found, that the
unfortunate queen, tho' ſhe ſurvived this diſgrace ſeveral years, was
never treated with any more lenity, but was allowed to end her life in poverty,
ſolitude, and confinement. This woman had been raiſed to the throne from a
very private ſtation; poſſeſſed great authority during her
huſband's life-time; fell afterwards into the deepeſt diſtreſs; ſaw
the murder of all her male children; had again the ſatisfaction of
contributing to the exaltation of her daughter; an event which immediately
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved her in vexation, and ſoon after in miſery: And on the whole,
ſhe furniſhes ample materials for reflections on the inſtability of
fortune; reflections, which hiſtory, as it relates the adventures of the
great, does more frequently ſuggeſt than even the incidents of common
life.</p>
               <p>THE next meaſure of the King was of a leſs exceptionable
nature. He ordered that Warwic ſhould be taken from the Tower, be led in
proceſſion through the ſtreets of London, be conducted to St. Paul's, and
there expoſed to the eyes of <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0429000101:21"/> the whole people. He even
gave directions, that ſome perſons of condition, who were attached to the
houſe of York, and were beſt acquainted with the perſon of this prince,
ſhould approach him and converſe with him: And he truſted, that theſe,
being convinced of the abſurd impoſture of Simnel, would put a ſtop to
the credulity of the people. The expedient had its effect in England: But in
Ireland the people ſtill perſiſted in their revolt, and zealouſly
retorted on the King the reproach of propagating an impoſture, and of having
ſhown a counterfeit Warwic to the people.</p>
               <p>HENRY had ſoon reaſon to apprehend, that the deſign
againſt him was not laid on ſuch ſlight foundations as the abſurdity of
the contrivance ſeemed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. John earl of Lincoln, ſon of John de
la Pole, duke of Suffolk, and of Elizabeth, eldeſt ſiſter to Edward the
fourth, was engaged to take part in the conſpiracy. This nobleman, who
poſſeſt capacity and courage, had entertained very aſpiring views; and
his ambition was encouraged by the known intentions of his uncle, Richard, who
had formed a deſign, in cafe himſelf ſhould die without iſſue, of
declaring Lincoln ſucceſſor to the crown. The King's jealouſy againſt
all eminent perſons of the York-party, and his rigour towards Warwic, had
far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtruck Lincoln with apprehenſions, and made him reſolve to
ſeek for ſafety in the moſt dangerous councils. Having fixed a ſecret
correſpondence with ſir Thomas Broughton, a man of great intereſt in
Lancaſhire, he ſet out for Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, where Lovel had arrived a little
before him; and he joined the court of his aunt, the dutcheſs of Burgundy, by
whom he had been invited over.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Intrigues of the dutcheſs of
Burgundy.</note> MARGARET, widow of Charles the bold, duke of Burgundy, having
born no children to her huſband, attached herſelf with an entire
friendſhip to her daughter-in-law, married to Maximilian, archduke of
Auſtria; and after the death of that princeſs, ſhe perſevered in her
affection to Philip and Margaret, her children, and occupied herſelf in their
education and in the care of their perſons. By her virtuous conduct and
demeanour, ſhe had acquired great authority among the Flemings; and lived
with much dignity, as well as oeconomy, upon that ample dowry, which ſhe
inherited from her huſband. The reſentments of this princeſs were no
leſs warm than her friendſhips; and that ſpirit of faction, which it is
ſo difficult for a ſocial and ſanguine temper to guard againſt, had
taken ſtrong poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of her heart, and entrenched ſomewhat on
the probity, which ſhone forth in other parts of her character. Hearing of
the malignant jealouſy, entertained by Henry againſt her family, and his
oppreſſion of all its partizans; ſhe was moved with the higheſt
indignation, and determined to make him repent of that enmity, which he
ſeemed ſo wantonly to court. After conſulting with Lincoln

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1487</label> and Lovel, ſhe hired a
body of two thouſand veteran Germans, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Martin Swart, a
brave and experienced officer<note n="*" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil, p. 572,
573.</note>; and ſent them over, together with theſe two noblemen, to join
Simnel in Ireland. The countenance, given by perſons of ſuch high
condition, and the acceſſion of this military force, raiſed extremely the
courage of the Iriſh, and made them entertain the reſolution of invading
England, where they believed the ſpirit of diſaffection to prevail as much
as it had appeared to do in Ireland. 
<note place="margin">Lambert Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel invades England.</note> The
poverty alſo, under which they laboured, made it impoſſible for them to
maintain any longer their new court and army, and inſpired them with a
ſtrong deſire of enriching themſelves by plunder and preferment in
England.</p>
               <p>HENRY was not ignorant of theſe intentions of his enemies; and
he prepared himſelf for reſiſtance. He ordered troops to be muſtered in
different parts of the kingdom, and put them under the command of the duke of
Bedford, and the earl of Oxford. He confined from jealouſy the marquis of
Dorſet, who was brother to the queen regent; and who, he ſuſpected, would
revenge the injuries ſuffered by his ſiſter. And to allure the people by
an appearance of devotion, he made a pilgrimage to our lady of Walſingham,
famous for miracles; and there offered up prayers for ſucceſs and for
deliverance from his enemies.</p>
               <p>BEING informed that Simnel and his forces were landed at Foudrey
in Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, he drew together his own troops, and advanced towards them as
far as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry. The rebels had entertained hopes, that the diſaffected
counties in the North would riſe in their favour: But the people, averſe to
join Iriſh and German invaders, convinced of Lambert's impoſture, and kept
in awe by the King's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for ſucceſs and conduct, either remained
in tranquillity, or gave all aſſiſtance to the royal army. The earl of
Lincoln, therefore, who commanded the rebels, finding no hopes but in ſpeedy
victory, was determined to bring the matter to a deciſion; and the King,
ſupported by the native courage of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and emboldened by a great
acceſſion of volunteers, which had joined him, under the earl of
Shrewſbury and lord Strange, declined not the combat. 
<note place="margin">6th of June.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Battle of Stoke.</note> The oppoſite armies
met at Stoke in the county of Nottingham, and fought a battle, which was more
bloody and more obſtinately diſputed than could have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from
the inequality of their force. All the leaders of the rebels were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to conquer or to die, and they inſpired their troops with a like
reſolution. The Germans alſo, being veteran and experienced ſoldiers,
kept the victory long doubtful; and even the Iriſh, tho' ill-armed and
almoſt defenceleſs, ſhowed themſelves not defective in ſpirit and
bravery. The King's victory was purchaſed <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0429000101:23"/> with loſs,
but was entirely deciſive. Lincoln, Broughton and Swart periſhed in the
field of battle, with four thouſand of their troops. Lovel, never having been
heard of more, was believed to have undergone the ſame fate. Simnel with his
tutor, Simon, was taken priſoner. Simon, being a prieſt, was not tried at
law, and was only committed to cloſe cuſtody: Simnel was too contemptible
either to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite apprehenſion or reſentment in Henry. He was pardoned, and
made a ſcullion in the King's kitchen; whence he was afterwards advanced to
the rank of a falconer<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon, p. 586. Pol. Virg. p.
574.</note>.</p>
               <p>HENRY had now leiſure to revenge himſelf of his enemies. He
took a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs into the northern parts, where he made the people fully
ſenſible of the rigours of his juſtice. A ſtrict inquiry was made after
thoſe who had aſſiſted or favoured the rebels. The puniſhments were
not all ſanguinary. The King made his revenge ſubſervient to his avarice.
Heavy fines were levied from the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents. In giving ſentence, the
proceedings of the courts, and even the courts themſelves, were entirely
arbitrary. Either the criminals were tried by commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners appointed for
that purpoſe, or they ſuffered puniſhment by ſentence of a court
martial. And as a rumour had prevailed before the battle of Stoke, that the
rebels had gained the victory, that the King's army was cut in pieces, and that
the King himſelf had eſcaped by flight, Henry was reſolved to interpret
the belief or propagation of this report as a mark of diſaffection; and he
puniſhed many for that pretended crime. But ſuch, in this age, was the
ſituation of the Engliſh government, that the royal prerogative, which was
but little reſtrained during the moſt peaceable periods, was ſure, in
tumultuous, or even ſuſpicious times, which frequently occurred, to break
all bounds of law and order.</p>
               <p>AFTER the King had ſatisfied his rigour by the puniſhment of
his enemies, he reſolved to give contentment to the people, in a point,
which, tho' a mere cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, was very paſſionately deſired by them. The
Queen had been married near two years, but had not yet been crowned; and this
affectation of delay had given great diſcontent to the public, and had been
one principal ſource of the diſaffection which prevailed. 
<note place="margin">25th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.</note> The King,
inſtructed by experience, now finiſhed the ceremony of her coronation; and
to ſhew a ſtill more gracious diſpoſition, he gave liberty to her
uncle, the marquiſs of Dorſet, who had been able to clear himſelf of all
the crimes of which he was accuſed.</p>

                  <note place="margin">State of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign affairs.</note> THE King
acquired great reputation throughout all Europe by the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and
vigorous conduct of his domeſtic affairs; and as ſome incidents, about this
time, invited him to look abroad, and exert himſelf in behalf of his allies,
it will be neceſſary, in order to give a juſt account of his foreign
meaſures, to explain the condition of the neighbouring kingdoms; beginning
with Scotland, which lies moſt contiguous.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">State of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> THE kingdom of
Scotland had not as yet attained that ſtate, which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes a
civilized monarchy, and which enables the government, by the force of its laws
and inſtitutions alone, without any extraordinary capacity in the
ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, to maintain itſelf in order and tranquillity. James the third,
who now filled the throne, was a man of little induſtry and of a narrow
genius; and tho' it behoved him to yield the reins of government to his
miniſters, he had never been able to make any choice, which could give
contentment both to himſelf and to his people. When he beſtowed his
confidence on any of the principal nobility, he found, that they exalted their
own family to ſuch a height, as was dangerous to the prince, and gave umbrage
to the ſtate: When he conferred favour on any perſon of meaner birth, on
whoſe ſubmiſſion he could more depend, the barons of his kingdom,
enraged at the power of an upſtart minion, proceeded to the utmoſt 
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0429000101:25"/> extremities againſt their ſovereign. Had Henry
entertained the ambition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, a tempting opportunity now offered of
reducing that kingdom to ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but as he was probably ſenſible,
that a warlike people, tho' they might be over-run by reaſon of their
domeſtic diviſions, could not be retained in obedience without a regular
military force, which was then unknown in England, he rather propoſed the
renewal of the peace with Scotland, and ſent an embaſſy to James for that
purpoſe. But the Scotch, who never deſired a long peace with England, and
who thought that their ſecurity conſiſted in preſerving themſelves
conſtantly in a warlike poſture, would not agree to more than a ſeven
years truce, which was accordingly concluded<note n="*" place="bottom">Polyd.
Virg. p. 575.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE European ſtates on the continent were then haſtening
faſt to that ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which they have remained, without any material
alterations, for near three centuries; and began to unite themſelves into one
extenſive ſyſtem of policy, which comprehended the chief powers of
Chriſtendom. 
<note place="margin">State of Spain.</note> Spain, which had
hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thertobeen almoſt entirely occupied within herſelf, now became
formidable by the union of Arragon and Caſtile, in the perſons of Ferdinand
and Iſabella, who, being princes of great capacity, employed their force in
enterprizes the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to their combined monarchy. The conqueſt
of Granada over the Moors was then undertaken, and brought near to a happy
concluſion. And in that expedition the military genius of Spain was revived;
honour and ſecurity were attained; and her princes, no longer held in fear by
a domeſtic enemy ſo dangerous, began to enter into all the tranſactions
of Europe, and make a great figure in every war and negotiation.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Of the Low Countries.</note> MAXIMILIAN, King
of the Romans, ſon to the emperor Frederic, had, by his marriage with the
heireſs of the houſe of Burgundy, acquired an intereſt in the low country
provinces; and tho' the death of his ſpouſe had weakened his connexion with
that territory, he ſtill pretended to the government as tutor to his ſon
Philip, and his authority had been acknowledged by Brabant, Holland, and
ſeveral of the provinces. But as Flanders and Hainault ſtill refuſed to
ſubmit to his regency, and even appointed other tutors to Philip, he had been
engaged in long wars againſt thoſe obſtinate people, and never was able
thoroughly to ſubdue their ſpirit. That he might free himſelf from the
oppoſition of France, he had concluded a peace with Lewis the eleventh, and
had given his daughter, Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, then an infant, in marriage to the Dauphin;
together with Artois, Franche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comté, and Charolois as her dowry. But
this alliance had not produced the deſired effect. The dauphin ſucceeded to
the crown of France under the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0429000101:26"/> of Charles the

Engliſh had been expelled from all their conqueſts; the authority of the
prince had been raiſed to ſuch a condition as enabled him to maintain law
and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; a conſiderable military force was kept on foot, and the finances
were able to ſupport them. Lewis the eleventh indeed, from whom many of
theſe advantages were derived, was dead, and had left his ſon, in very
early youth and ill educated, to ſuſtain the weight of the monarchy: But
having entruſted the government to his daughter, Anne Lady of Beaujeu, a
woman of ſpirit and capacity, the French power ſuffered no check or
decline. On the contrary, this princeſs formed the great project, which at
laſt ſhe happily effected, of uniting to the crown Britanny, the laſt and
moſt independent fief of the monarchy.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of Britanny.</note> FRANCIS the ſecond,
duke of Britanny, was a good, but a weak prince, who, conſcious of his own
unfitneſs for government, had reſigned himſelf entirely to the direction
of Peter Landais, a man of very mean birth, more remarkable for his ability
than for his virtue or integrity. The nobles of Britanny, diſpleaſed with
the great advancement of this favourite, had even proceeded to diſaffection
againſt their ſovereign; and after many tumults and conſpiracies, they at
laſt united among themſelves, and in a violent manner, ſeized, tried, and
put to death the obnoxious miniſter. Fearing the reſentment of the prince
for this invaſion of his authority, many of them retired to France; and
others, for their protection and ſafety, maintained a correſpondence with
that court. The French miniſtry, obſerving the great diſſentions among
the Bretons, thought the opportunity fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable for invading that dutchy; and
ſo much the more, that they could cover their ambition under the ſpecious
pretence of providing for domeſtic ſecurity.</p>
               <p>LEWIS, duke of Orleans, firſt prince of the blood, and
preſumptive heir of the monarchy, had diſputed the adminiſtration with
the lady of Beaujeu; and tho' his pretenſions had been rejected by the
ſtates, he ſtill maintained cabals with many of the grandees, and laid
ſchemes for ſubverting the authority of that princeſs. Finding his
ſchemes detected, he took arms, and fortified himſelf in Beaugenci; but as
his revolt was precipitate, before his confederates were ready to riſe with
him, he had been obliged to ſubmit, and to receive whatever conditions the
French miniſtry were pleaſed to impoſe upon him. Actuated however by his
ambition, and even by his fears, he ſoon retired out of France, and took
ſhelter with the <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0429000101:27"/> dexcl=Yke of Britanny, who was
deſirous of ſtrengthening himſelf againſt the deſigns of the lady of
Beaujeu by the friendſhip and credit of the duke of Orleans. This prince
alſo, obſerving the aſcendant which he ſoon acquired over the duke of
Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanny, had engaged many of his partizans to join him at that court, and had
formed the deſign of aggrandizing himſelf by a marriage with Anne, the
heireſs of that opulent dutchy.</p>
               <p>THE barons of Britanny, who ſaw all favour engroſſed by
the duke of Orleans and his train, renewed a ſtricter correſpondence with
France, and even invited the French King to make an invaſion on their
country. Deſirous however to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve its independancy, they had regulated
the number of ſuccours, which France was to ſend, and had ſtipulated that
no fortified place in Britanny ſhould remain in the poſſeſſion of
that monarchy. A vain precaution, where revolted ſubjects treat with a power
ſo much ſuperior! 
<note place="margin">French inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanny.</note> The
French invaded Britanny with forces three times more numerous than thoſe
which they had promiſed to the barons; and advancing into the heart of the
country, laid ſiege to Ploermel. To oppoſe them, the duke raiſed a
numerous, but ill-diſciplined army, which he put under the command of the
duke of Orleans, the count of Dunois, and others of the French nobility. The
army, diſcontented with this choice, and jealous of their confederates,
ſoon diſbanded, and left their prince with too ſmall a force to keep the
field againſt his invaders. He retired to Vannes; but being hotly purſued
by the French, who had made themſelves maſters of Ploermel, he eſcaped to
Nantz; and the enemy, having taken and garrifoned Vannes, Dinant, and other
places, laid cloſe ſiege to that city. The barons of Britanny, finding
their country me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced with total ſubjection, began gradually to withdraw
from the French army, and make peace with their ſovereign.</p>
               <p>THIS deſertion, however, of the Bretons diſcouraged not the
court of France from purſuing their favourite project of reducing Britanny to
ſubjection. The ſituation of Europe appeared very favourable to the
execution of this deſign. Maximilian was engaged in cloſe alliance with the
duke of Britanny, and was even in treaty for marrying his daughter; but he was
on all occaſions ſo neceſſitous of money, and at that time ſo
diſquieted by the mutinies of the Flemings, that little effectual
aſſiſtance could be expected from him. Ferdinand was entirely occupied in
the conqueſt of Granada; and it was alſo known, that if Franexcl=Ye
reſigned to him Rouſillon and Cerdagne, to which he had pretenſions,
ſhe would at any time engage him to abandon the intereſts of Britanny.
England alone was both enabled by her power, and engaged by her intereſts, to
ſupport the independency of that dutchy; and the moſt dangerous
oppoſition was therefore, by the French, expected from that quarter. In order
to cover their real deſigns, no ſooner were they informed 
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0429000101:28"/> of Henry's ſucceſs againſt Simnel and his partizans,
than they diſpatched ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to the court of London, and made
profeſſions of the utmoſt truſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in that monarch.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">French em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> THE
ambaſſadors, after congratulating Henry on the late victory, and
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating to him in the moſt cordial manner, as to an intimate friend,
ſome ſucceſſes of their maſter againſt Maximilian, came in the
progreſs of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to mention the late tranſactions in
Britanny. They told him that the duke of Britanny having given protection to
French fugitives and rebels, the King had been neceſſitated, contrary to
his intention and inclination, to carry war into that dutchy: That the honour
of the crown was intereſted not to ſuffer a vaſſal ſo far to forget
his duty to his liege lord; nor was the ſecurity of the government of France
leſs concerned to prevent the conſequences of this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temerity:
That the fugitives were no mean nor obſcure perſons; but, among others, the
duke of Orleans, firſt prince of the blood, who, finding himſelf obnoxious
to juſtice for treaſonable practices in France, had fled into
Bexcl=Yitanny; where he ſtill perſevered in laying ſchemes of rebellion
againſt his ſovereign: That the war being thus, on the part of the French
moexcl=Yarch, entirely defenſive, it would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ceaſe, when the
duke of Britanny, by returning to his duty, ſhould remove the cauſes of it:
That their maſter was ſenſible of the obligations which that duke, in
very critical times, had conferred on Henry; but it was known alſo, that, in
times ſtill more critical, he or his mercenary counſellors had deſerted
him, and put his life in the utmoſt hazard: That his ſole refuge in ſuch
deſperate extremities had been the court of France, which not only protected
his perſon, but ſupplied him with men and money, with which, aided by his
own valour and conduct, he had been enabled to mount the throne of England:
That France, in this tranſaction, had, from friendſhip to Henry, acted
contrary to what, in a narrow view, might be eſteemed her own intereſt;
ſince, inſtead of an odious tyrant, ſhe had contributed to eſtabliſh
on a rival throne a prince endowed with ſuch virtue and ability: And that as
both the juſtice of the cauſe and the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations conferred on Henry thus
preponderated on the ſide of France, their maſter expected, that, if the
ſituation of Henry's affairs allowed him not to give aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aexcl=Yce
to that kingdom, he would at leaſt preſerve a neutrality between the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending parties<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon, p. 589.</note>.</p>
               <p>THIS diſcourſe of the French ambaſſadors was
plauſible; and to give it greater weight, they communicated to Henry, as in
confidence, their maſter's intentexcl=Yon, after he ſhould have compoſed
the differences with Britanny, to lead an army into Italy, and make good his
pretenſions to the kingdom of Naples: A project, <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0429000101:29"/> which,
they knew, would give no umbrage to the court of England. But all theſe
artifices were in vain employed againſt the penetration of the King. He
clearly ſaw, that France had entertained the view of ſubduing Britanny; but
he alſo perceived, that ſhe would meet with great, and, as he thought,
inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable difficulties in the execution of her project. The native force
of that dutchy, he knew, had always been conſiderable, and had often, without
any foreign aſſiſtance, reſiſted the power of France; the natural
temper of the French nation, he imagined, would make them eaſily abandon
every enterprize, which required per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance; and as the heir of the crown
was confederated with the duke of Britanny, the courtiers would be ſtill more
remiſs in proſecuting a ſcheme which muſt draw on them his reſentment
and diſpleaſure. Should even theſe internal obſtructions be removed,
Maximilian, whoſe enmity to France was well known, and who now paid his
addreſſes to the heireſs of Britanny, would be able to make a
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion on the ſide of Flanders; nor could it be expected, that France,
if ſhe proſecuted ſuch ambitious projects, would be allowed to remain in
tranquillity by Ferdinand and Iſabella. Above all, he thought, the French
court could never expect, that England, ſo deeply intereſted to preſerve
the independancy of Britanny, ſo able by her power and ſituation to give
effectual and prompt aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, would permit ſuch an acceſſion of
force to be made to her rival. He imagined, therefore, that the miniſters of
France, convinced of the impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of their ſchemes, would at laſt
embrace pacific views, and would abandon an enterprize, ſo obnoxious to all
the potentates of Europe.</p>
               <p>THIS reaſoning of Henry was ſolid, and might very juſtly
engage him in dilatory and cautious meaſures: But there entered into his
conduct another motive, which was apt to draw him beyond the juſt bounds,
becauſe founded on a ruling paſſion. His frugality, which by degrees
degenerated into avarice, made him averſe to all warlike enterprizes and
diſtant expeditions; and engaged him previouſly to try the expedient of
negotiation. He diſpatched Urſwic, his almoner, a man of addreſs and
ability, to make offer of his mediation to the contending parties: An offer,
which, he thought, if accepted by France, would ſoon lead to a compoſure of
all differences; if refuſed or eluded, would at leaſt diſcover the
perſeverance of that court in their ambitious projects. Urſwic found the
lady of Beaujeu, now dutcheſs of Bourbon, engaged in the ſiege of Nantz,
and had the ſatisfaction to find that his maſter's mediation was very
readily embraced, and with many expreſſions of confidence and moderation. 
<note place="margin">Diſſimulation of the French Court.</note>
That able princeſs concluded, that the duke of Orleans, who governed the
court of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanny, forſeeing that every accommodation muſt be made at his
expence, would uſe all his intereſt to have Henry's propoſal rejected;
and would by that means <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0429000101:30"/> make an effectual apology for the
French meaſures, and draw on the Bretons the reproach of obſtinacy and
injuſtice. The event juſtified her prudence. When the Engliſh
ambaſſador made the ſame applications to the duke of Britanny, he
received for anſwer, in name of that Prince, that having ſo long acted the
part of protector and guardian to Henry, during his youth and adverſity, he
had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, from a monarch of ſuch virtue, more effectual
aſſiſtance, in his preſent diſtreſſes, than a barren offer of
mediation, which ſuſpended not the progreſs of the French arms: That if
Henry's gratitude was not ſufficient to engage him in ſuch a meaſure, his
prudence, as King of England, ſhould diſcover to him the pernicious
conſequences attending the conqueſt of Britanny, and its annexation to the
crown of France: That that kingdom, already become too powerful, would be
enabled, by ſo great an acceſſion of force, to diſplay, to the ruin of
England, that hoſtile diſpoſition, which had always ſubſiſted
between thoſe rival nations: That Britanny, ſo uſeful an ally, which, by
its ſituation, gave the Engliſh an entrance into the heart of France; being
annexed to that kingdom, would be equally enabled from its ſituation to
diſturb, either by pyracies or naval arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the commerce and peace of
England: And that if the duke refuſed Henry's mediation, it proceeded neither
from an inclination to a war, which he experienced to be ſo ruinous to him,
nor from a confidence in his own force, which he knew to be ſo much inferior
to that of the enemy; but merely from a ſenſe of his preſent
neceſſity, which muſt engage the King to act the part of his confederate,
not of a mediator.</p>
               <p>WHEN this anſwer was reported to the King, he abandoned not
the ſyſtem of conduct which he had formed: He only concluded, that ſome
more time was requiſite to quell the obſtinacy of the Bretons and make them
ſubmit to reaſon. And when he learned, that the people of Britanny, anxious
for their duke's ſafety, had formed a tumultuary army of 60,000 men, and had
obliged the French to raiſe the ſiege of Nantz, he fortified himſelf the
more in his opinion, that the court of France would at laſt be reduced, by
multiplied obſtacles and difficulties, to abandon the project of reducing
Britanny to ſubjection. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued therefore the ſcheme of negotiation,
and thereby expoſed himſelf to be deceived by the artifices of the French
miniſtry; who, ſtill pretending pacific intentions, ſent lord Bernard
Daubigni, a Scotch man of quality, to London, and preſſed Henry not to be
diſcouraged in offering his mediation to the court of Britanny. The King on
his part diſpatched another embaſſy compoſed of Urſwic, the abbot of
Abingdon and Sir Richard Tonſtal, who carried new propoſals for an amicable
accommodation. No effectual ſuccours, mean while, were provided for the
diſtreſſed Bretons. The lord Woodville, brother to the queen dowager, a 
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0429000101:31"/> man of courage and enterprize, having aſked leave to
raiſe underhand a body of volunteers and tranſport them into Britanny, met
with a refuſal from the King, who was deſirous of preſerving the
appearance of a ſtrict neutrality. That noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, however, ſtill
perſiſted in his intentions. He went over to the Iſle of Wight, of which
he was governor; levied a body of 400 men; and having at laſt obtained, as is
ſuppoſed, the ſecret permiſſion of Henry, ſailed with them to
Britanny. This enterprize proved fatal to the leader, and brought ſmall
relief to the unhappy Duke. 
<note place="margin">28th of July.</note> The Bretons raſhly
engaged in a general action with the French at St. Aubin, and were totally
diſcomfited. Woodville and all the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh were put to the ſword;
together with a body of Bretons, who had been accouttered in the garb of
Engliſhmen, in order to ſtrike a greater terror into the French, to whom
the martial proweſs of that nation was always formidable<note n="*" place="bottom">Argentré Hiſt. de Bretagne, Liv. 12.</note>. The duke of
Orleans, the prince of Orange, and many other perſons of rank were taken
priſoners. And the military force of Britanny was totally diſſipated. 
<note place="margin">9th Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> The death of the duke,
which followed ſoon after, threw affairs into ſtill greater confuſion,
and ſeemed to threaten the ſtate with a final ſubjection.</p>
               <p>THO' the King prepared not againſt theſe events, ſo
hurtful to the intereſt of England, with ſufficient vigour and precaution,
he had not altogether over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked them. Determined to obſerve a pacific
conduct, as far as the ſituation of affairs would permit, he yet knew the
warlike diſpoſition of his ſubjects, and obſerved, that their antient
and inveterate animoſity to France was now revived by the proſpect of this
great acceſſion to its power and grandeur. He reſolved therefore to make
advantage of thoſe humours, and to draw ſome ſupplies of money from the
people, under pretext of giving aſſiſtance to the Duke of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanny. He
had ſummoned a Parliament to meet at Weſtminſter<note n="†" place="bottom">9th November, 1487.</note>; and he ſoon perſwaded them to
grant him a conſiderable ſubſidy<note n="‡" place="bottom">Polydore
Virgil, p. 579, ſays that this impoſition was a capitation tax; the other
hiſtorians ſay it was a tax of two ſhillings on the pound.</note>. But
this ſupply, tho' voted by Parliament, involved the King in unexpected
difficulties. 
<note place="margin">An inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the North.</note> The
counties of Durham and York, always diſcontented with Henry's government, and
far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provoked by the late oppreſſions, under which they had laboured,
after the ſuppreſſion of Simnel's rebellion, reſiſted the
commiſſioners who were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to levy the new tax. The
commiſſioners, terrified with this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſedition, made
application to the Earl of Northumberland, and deſired of him advice and
aſſiſtance in the execution of their office. That nobleman thought the
matter of importance enough to conſult the King; who, unwilling to yield to
the humours of a diſcontented populace, and foreſeeing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0429000101:32"/> conſequences of ſuch a precedent, renewed his orders
for a ſtrict levy of the impoſition. Northumberland ſummoned together the
juſtices and chief free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, and delivered the King's commands in the
moſt imperious terms, which, he thought, would inforce obedience, but which
tended only to provoke the people, and make them believe him the adviſer of
thoſe orders which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to them<note n="†" place="bottom">Bacon, p. 595.</note>. They flew to arms, and attacked
Northumberland's houſe, whom they put to death. Having incurred ſuch deep
guilt, their mutinous humour prompted them to declare againſt the King
himſelf; and being inſtigated by one John Achamber, a ſeditious fellow of
mean birth, they choſe Sir John Egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond their leader, and prepared
themſelves for a vigorous reſiſtance. Henry was not diſmayed with an
inſurrection ſo precipitant and ill ſupported. He immediately levied a
force which he put under the command of the earl of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey, whom he had
delivered from confinement, and reſtored to his favour. His intention was to
ſend down theſe troops, in order to check the progreſs of the rebels;
while he himſelf ſhould follow with a greater body, which would
abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely inſure ſucceſs. But Surrey thought himſelf ſtrong
enough to encounter a raw and unarmed multitude; and he ſucceeded in the
attempt. 
<note place="margin">Suppreſſed.</note> The rebels were
diſſipated; John Achamber taken priſoner, and afterwards executed with
ſome of his accomplices; Sir John Egremond fled to the dutcheſs of
Burgundy, who gave him protection; the greater number of the rebels received
their pardon.</p>
               <p>HENRY had probably expected, when he obtained this grant from
the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that he would be able to terminate the affair of Britanny by
negotiation, and that he might thereby fill his coffers with the money levied
by the impoſition. But as the diſtreſſes of the Bretons ſtill
multiplied, and became every day more ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; he found himſelf under the
neceſſity of taking ſome meaſures, in order to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them. On the
death of the duke, the French had revived ſome antiquated claims to the
dominion of the dutchy; and as the duke of Orleans was now captive in France,
their former pretext for hoſtilities could no longer ſerve as a cover to
their ambition. The King reſolved therefore to engage as auxiliary to
Britanny; and to conſult the intereſt, as well as deſires of his people,
by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing himſelf to the progreſs of the French power. Beſides
entering into a league with Maximilian, and another with Ferdinand, which were
diſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, he levied a body of troops, to the number of 6000 men,
with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of tranſporting them into Britanny.

of lord Willoughby of Broke; and made the Bretons, during ſome time,
maſters of the field. The French retired into their garriſons; and
propoſed by dilatory meaſures to waſte the fire of the Engliſh, and
diſguſt them with their enterprize. The ſcheme was well laid, and met
with ſucceſs. Lord Broke found ſuch diſcord and confuſion in the
councils of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanny, that no meaſures could be concerted for any
undertaking; no ſupply ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; no proviſions, carriages, ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The whole court was rent into factions: No one miniſter had acquired the
aſcendant: And whatever project was formed by one, was ſure to be
traverſed by another. The Engliſh, diſconcerted in every enterprize, by
theſe animoſities and uncertain councils, returned home as ſoon as the
time of their ſervice was elapſed; leaving only a ſmall garriſon in
thoſe towns which had been put into their hands. During their ſtay in
Britanny, they had done nothing but contributed ſtill far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to waſte the
country; and by their departure, they left it entirely at the mercy of the
enemy. So feeble was the ſuccour, which Henry in this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant conjuncture
afforded his ally, whom the invaſion of a foreign enemy, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with
domeſtic diſſenſions, had reduced to the utmoſt diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>THE great object of diſſenſion among the Bretons was the
diſpoſal of the young dutcheſs in marriage. The mareſchal Rieux
ſeconded the ſuit of the lord Albert, who led ſome forces to her
aſſiſtance. The chancellor Montauban, obſerving the averſion of the
dutcheſs to this ſuitor, inſiſted, that a petty prince, ſuch as
Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, was unable to ſupport Anne in her preſent extremities; and he
recommended ſome more powerful alliance, particularly that of Maximilian,
King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1490</label> This party at laſt
prevailed; the marriage with Maximilian was celebrated by proxy; and the
dutcheſs thenceforth aſſumed the title of queen of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. But this
magnificent appellation was all ſhe gained by her marriage. Maximili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, deſtitute of troops and money, and embarraſſed
with the continual revolts of the Flemings, could give no aſſiſtance to
his diſtreſſed conſort: While Albert, enraged at the preference given
his rival, deſerted her cauſe, and received the French into Nantz, the
moſt important place in the dutchy, both for ſtrength and riches.</p>
               <p>THE French court began now to change their ſcheme with regard
to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on of Britanny. Charles had formerly been aſſianced to
Margaret daughter of Maximilian; who, tho' too young to conſummate her
marriage, had been <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0429000101:34"/> ſent to Paris to be educated, and
bore at this time the title of queen of France. Beſides the rich dowry, which
ſhe brought the King, ſhe was, after her brother, Philip, then in early
youth, heireſs to the whole dominions of the houſe of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy; and
ſeemed in many reſpects the moſt proper match, which could be choſen
for the young monarch. Theſe circumſtances had ſo blinded the councils
both of Maximilian and Henry, that they never ſuſpected any other
intentions in the French court; nor were able to diſcover, that engagements,
ſo advantageous and ſo ſolemnly entered into, could be infringed and
ſet aſide. But Charles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to perceive, that the conqueſt of Britanny,
in oppoſition to the natives, and to all the great powers in Chriſtendom,
would prove a very difficult enterprize; and that even, if he ſhould over-run
the country and make himſelf maſter of the fortreſſes, it would be
impoſſible for him long to retain poſſeſſion of them. The marriage
alone of the dutcheſs could fully re-annex that fief to the crown; and the
preſent and certain enjoyment of ſo conſiderable a territory ſeemed
preferable to the proſpect of inheriting the dominions of the houſe of
Burgundy; a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which became every day more diſtant and precarious.
Above all, the marriage of Maximilian and Anne appeared deſtructive to the
grandeur and even ſecurity of the French monarchy; while that prince ſhould
poſſeſs Flanders on the one hand, and Britanny on the other, and might
thus from both quarters make inroads into the heart of the country. The only
remedy for theſe evils was therefore concluded to be the diſſolution of
the two marriages, which had been celebrated, but not conſummated; and the
eſpouſals of the dutcheſs of Britanny, and the King of France.</p>
               <p>THIS expedient, which had not been foreſeen by any court of
Europe, and which they were, all of them, ſo much engaged in point of
intereſt to oppoſe, it was requiſite to keep a profound ſecret, and
only to diſcover to the world by the full execution of it. The meaſures of
the French miniſtry were in the conduct of this delicate enterprize very
wiſe and political. While they preſſed Britanny with all the rigours of
war, they ſecretly gained the count of Dunois, who poſſeſſed great
authority with the Bretons; and having alſo engaged in their intereſts the
prince of Orange, couſin-german to the dutcheſs, they gave him his liberty,
and ſent him into Britanny. Theſe perſons, ſupported by other
emiſſaries of France, prepared the minds of men for the great revolution
projected, and diſplayed, tho' ſtill with many precautions, all the
advantages of an union with the French monarchy. They repreſented to the
Britiſh barons, that their country, harraſſed during ſo many years with
perpetual war, had need of ſome repoſe, and of a ſolid and laſting
peace with the only power that was formidable to them: That their alliance with
Maximilian was not able to afford them even preſent protection; and by 
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0429000101:35"/> uniting them cloſely with a power, which was rival to
the greatneſs of France, fixed them in perpetual enmity with that powerful
monarchy: That their near neighbourhood expoſed them firſt to the inroads
of the enemy; and the happieſt event, which in ſuch a ſituation could
befal them, would be to attain peace, tho' by a final ſubjection to France,
and by the loſs of that liberty, tranſmitted them from their anceſtors:
And that any other expedient, compatible with the honour of the ſtate, and
their duty to their ſovereign, was preferable to a ſcene of ſuch
diſorder and devaſtation.</p>
               <p>THESE ſuggeſtions had influence on the Bretons: But the
chief difficulty lay in ſurmounting the prejudices of the young dutcheſs
herſelf. That princeſs had imbibed in her education a ſtrong prejudice
againſt the French nation, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly againſt Charles, who had been
the author of all the calamities, which, from her earlieſt infancy, had
befallen her family. She had alſo fixed her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on Maximilian; and as
ſhe now deemed him her huſband, ſhe could not, ſhe thought, without
incurring the greateſt guilt, and violating the moſt ſolemn engagements,
contract a marriage with another perſon. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1491</label> In
order to overcome her obſtinacy, Charles gave the duke of Orleans his
liberty, who, tho' formerly a ſuitor of the dutcheſs, was now contented to
ingratiate himſelf with the King, by employing in his favour all the
intereſt which he ſtill poſſeſſed in Britanny. The mareſchal
Rieux and chancellor Montauban were reconciled by his negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations; and
theſe rival miniſters now concurred with the prince of Orange, and the
count of Dunois, in preſſing the concluſion of a marriage with Charles.
From their ſuggeſtion, Charles advanced with a powerful army and inveſted
Rennes, at that time the reſidence of the dutcheſs; who, aſſailed on
all hands, and finding none to ſupport her in her inflexibility, at laſt
opened the gates of the city, and agreed to eſpouſe the King of France. 
<note place="margin">Annexation of Britanny to France.</note> She
was married at Langey in Touraine; conducted to St. Denis, where ſhe was
crowned; and thence made her entry into Paris, amidſt the joyful acclamations
of the people, who regarded this marriage as the moſt proſperous event that
could have befallen their monarchy.</p>
               <p>THE triumph and ſucceſs of Charles was the moſt
ſenſible mortification to the King of the Romans. He had loſt a
conſiderable territory, which he thought he had acquired, and an
accompliſhed princeſs whom he had eſpouſed; he was affronted in the
perſon of his daughter Margaret, who was ſent back to him, after being
treated during ſome years as queen of France; he had reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
himſelf with his own ſupine ſecurity, in neglecting the conſummation of
his marriage, which was eaſily practicable for him, and which would have
ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0429000101:36"/> the tye indiſſoluble: Theſe
conſiderations threw him into the moſt violent rage, which he vented in
very indecent expreſſions; and he threatened France with an invaſion from
the united arms of Auſtria, Spain, and England.</p>
               <p>THE King of England had alſo juſt reaſon to reproach
himſelf with miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in this important tranſaction; and tho' the
affair had terminated in a manner which he could not preciſely foreſee, his
negligence, in leaving ſo long his moſt uſeful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ally expoſed to
the invaſion of ſuperior power, could not but appear on reflection the
reſult of timid caution and narrow politics. As he valued himſelf very much
on his extenſive foreſight and profound judgment, the aſcendant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
over him, by a raw youth, ſuch as Charles, could not but give him the
higheſt diſpleaſure, and prompt him to ſeek vengeance, after all remedy
for his miſcarriage was become abſolutely impracticable. But he was farther
actuated by avarice, a motive ſtill more predominant with him than either
pride or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; and he ſought even from his preſent diſappointments,
the gratification of this ruling paſſion. 
<note place="margin">7th July.</note> Under pretext of a French
war, he iſſued a commiſſion for levying a <hi>Benevolence</hi> on his
people<note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer, Vol. XII. p. 446. Bacon ſays that the
benevolence was levied with conſent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is a
miſtake.</note>; an arbitrary taxation, which had been aboliſhed by a
recent law of Richard the third, and which was the more provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that, tho'
really raiſed by menaces and extortion, it was nevertheleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to
be given by the voluntary conſent of the people. This violence fell chiefly
on the commercial part of the nation, who were poſſeſſed of the ready
money. London alone contributed to the amount of near 10,000 pounds.
Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Morton, the chancellor, inſtructed the commiſſioners to
employ a dilemma, in which every one might be comprehended: If the perſons
applied to lived frugal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they were told, that their parſimony muſt
neceſſarily have enriched them: If their method of living was ſplendid
and hoſpitable, they were concluded opulent on account of their expences.
This device was by ſome called chancellor Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's fork, and by others his
crutch.</p>

was the King of a Parliament, on account of his levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this arbitrary
impoſition, that he ſoon after ſummoned that aſſembly to meet at
Weſtminſter; and he even expected to enrich himſelf farther by working on
their paſſions and prejudices. He knew the reſentment, which the
Engliſh had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt France, by reaſon of the conqueſt of
Britanny; and he took care to inſiſt on that topic, in the ſpeech, which
he himſelf pronounced to the Parliament. He told them, that France, elevated
with her late ſucceſſes, had even proceeded to a cont mpt of England, and
had refuſed to pay that tribute, which Lewis the eleventh had ſtipulated to
Edward the fourth: That it became ſo warlike a <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0429000101:37"/> nation as
the Engliſh to be rouzed with this indignity, and not to limit their
pretenſions merely to repreſſing the preſent injury: That for his part,
he was determined to lay claim to the crown of France itſelf, and to maintain
by force of arms ſo juſt a title tranſmitted to him by his gallant
anceſtors: That Creſſy, Poictiers, and Agincourt were ſufficient to
inſtruct them in their ſuperiority over the enemy; nor did he deſpair of
adding new names to the glorious catalogue: That a King of France had been
priſoner at London, and a King of England had been crowned at Paris; events
which ſhould animate them to an emulation of like glory with that enjoyed by
their forefathers: That the domeſtic diſſenſions of England had been

magnificent vaunts of the King, all men of pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration concluded, from the
perſonal character of the man, and ſtill more, from the ſituation of his
affairs, that he had no ſerious intention of puſhing the war to ſuch
extremity as he pretended. France was not now in the ſame condition as when
ſuch ſucceſsful inroads had been made into her by the former Kings of
England. The great fiefs were united to the crown; the princes of the blood
were deſirous of peace and tranquility; the kingdom abounded with able
cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and veteran ſoldiers; and the general aſpect of its affairs
ſeemed more to threaten its neighbours, than to ſubject it to any inſults
from them. The levity and vain glory of Maximilian were ſupported by his
pompous titles; but were ill ſeconded by military power, and ſtill leſs,
by any revenue, proportioned to them. The politic Ferdinand, while he made a
ſhow of war, was actually nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating for peace; and rather than expoſe
himſelf to any hazard, would accept of very moderate conceſſions from
France. Even England was not free from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic diſcontents; and in
Scotland, the death of Henry's friend and ally, James the third, who had been
murdered by his rebellious ſubjects, had made way for the ſucceſſion of
his ſon, James the fourth, who was devoted to the French intereſt, and
would ſurely be alarmed with any progreſs of the Engliſh arms. But all
theſe obvious conſiderations had no influence with the Parliament. Inflamed
by the ideas of ſubduing France, and of inriching themſelves with the
ſpoils of that <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0429000101:38"/> kingdom, they gave into the ſnare
prepared for them, and voted the ſupply which the King demanded. Two
fifteenths were granted him; and the better to enable his vaſſals and
nobility to attend him, an act was paſſed, empowering them to ſell their
eſtates, without paying any fines for alienation.</p>
               <p>THE nobility were univerſally ſeized with a deſire of
military glory; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing credulouſly ſwallowed all the boaſts of the
King, they dreamed of no leſs than carrying their triumphant arms to the
gates of Paris, and putting the crown of France on Henry's head. Many of them
borrowed large ſums or ſold off manors, that they might appear in the field
with greater ſplendour, and lead out their followers in more compleat order. 
<note place="margin">War with France.</note> The king croſſed
the ſeas, and arrived at Calais on the ſixth of October, with an army of
twenty-five thouſand foot and ſixteen hundred horſe, which he put under
the command of the duke of Bedford and the earl of Oxford: But as ſome
inferred, from his opening the campaign in ſo late a ſeaſon, that peace
would ſoon be concluded between the crowns, he was deſirous of
ſuggeſting a contrary inference. 
<q rend="inline">"He had come over," he ſaid, "to make an
entire conqueſt of France, which was not the work of one ſummer. It was
therefore of no conſequence at what ſeaſon he began the invaſion;
eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as he had Calais ready for winter quarters."</q> As if he had
ſeriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this enterprize, he inſtantly marched with his army
into the enemy's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and laid ſiege to Bulloigne: 
<note place="margin">Invaſion of France.</note> But
notwithſtanding this appearance of a hoſtile diſpoſition, there had
been ſecret advances made towards a peace above three months before; and
commiſſioners had been appointed to treat of the terms. The better to
reconcile the minds of men to this unexpected meaſure, the king's
ambaſſadors arrived in the camp from the Low Countries, and informed him,
that Maximilian was in no readineſs to join him; nor was any aſſiſtance
to be hoped for from that quarter. Soon after, meſſengers came from Spain,
and brought news of a peace concluded between that kingdom and France, in which
Charles had made a ceſſion of the counties of Rouſſillon and Cerdagne
to Ferdinand. Tho' theſe articles of intelligence were carefully
diſperſed thro' the army, the King was ſtill apprehenſive, leſt a
ſudden peace, after ſuch magnificent promiſes and high expectations,
would expoſe him to great reproach. That he might more effectually cover the
intended meaſures, he ſecretly engaged the marquiſs of Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
together with twenty three perſons of condition, to preſent him a petition
for his agreeing to a treaty with France. The pretence was founded on the late
ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the year, the difficulty of ſupplying the army at Calais
during winter, the obſtacles which aroſe in the ſiege of Bulloigne, the
deſertion of thoſe allies whoſe aſſiſtance had been moſt relied
on: Events which might, all of them, have been foreſeen before the
embarkation of the forces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0429000101:39"/> IN conſequence of theſe preparatory
ſteps, the biſhop of Exeter and the lord Daubeney were ſent to confer at
Eſtaples with the mareſchal of Cordes, and to put the laſt hand to the
treaty. A few days ſufficed for this purpoſe: The demands of Henry were
wholly pecuniary; and the King of France, who eſteemed the peaceable
poſſeſſion of Britanny an equivalent for any money, and who was all on
fire for his projected expedition into Italy, readily agreed to the propoſals
made him. 
<note place="margin">3d of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Peace with France.</note> He engaged to pay
Henry ſeven hundred and forty-five thouſand crowns, about one hundred and
eighty-ſix thouſand two hundred and fifty pounds ſterling; partly as a
reimburſement of the ſums advanced for Britanny, partly as arrears of the
penſion due to Edward the fourth. And he ſtipulated a yearly penſion to
Henry and his heirs of twenty-five thouſand crowns. Thus the King, as
remarked by his hiſtorian, made profit upon his ſubjects for the war; and
upon his enemies for the peace<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon, p. 605. Pol.
Virg. p. 586.</note>. And the people agreed, that he had fulfilled his
promiſe, when he ſaid to the parliament, that he would make the war
maintain itſelf. Maximilian was comprehended in Henry's treaty, if he
pleaſed to accept of it; but he diſdained to be in any reſpect beholden
to an ally, of whom, he thought, he had reaſon to complain: He made a
ſeparate peace with France, and obtained reſtitution of Artois,
Franchecomte and Charolois, which had been given as the dowry of his daughter,
when ſhe was affianced to the King of France.</p>
               <p>THE peace, concluded between England and France, was the more
likely to continue, that Charles, full of ambition and youthful hopes, bent all
his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſide of Italy, and ſoon after undertook the
conqueſt of Naples; an enterprize, which Henry regarded with the greater
indifference, that Naples lay remote from him, and France had never, in any
age, been ſucceſsful on that quarter. The King's authority was fully
eſtabliſhed at home; and every rebellion, which had been attempted
againſt him, had hitherto tended only to confound his enemies, and
conſolidate his power and influence. His reputation for policy and conduct
was every day augmenting; his treaſures had encreaſed even from the moſt
unproſperous events; the hopes of all pretenders to his throne were cut off,
as well by his marriage, as by the iſſue which it had brought him. In this
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing ſituation, the King had reaſon to flatter himſelf with the
proſpect of a durable peace and tranquillity: But his inveterate and
indefatigable enemies, whom he had wantonly provoked, raiſed up to him an
adverſary, who kept him long in inquietude, and ſometimes even brought him
into danger.</p>
               <p>THE dutcheſs of Burgundy, full of reſentment for the
depreſſion of her family and its partizans, rather irritated than
diſcouraged with the bad ſucceſs of her paſt <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0429000101:40"/>
enterprizes, was determined at leaſt to diſturb that government, which
ſhe found it ſo difficult to ſubvert. By means of her emiſſaries,
ſhe propagated the report, that her nephew, Richard Plantagenet, duke of
York, had eſcaped<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the Tower when his elder brother was murdered,
and that he lay ſtill ſomewhere concealed: And finding this rumour, however
improbable, to be greedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the people, ſhe had been looking out
for ſome young man, proper to perſonate that unfortunate prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Perkin War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec.</note> THERE was one Oſbec
or Warbec, a renegado Jew of Tournay, who had been carried by ſome
buſineſs to London in the reign of Edward the fourth, and had there a ſon
born to him. Having had opportunities of being known to the King, and obtaining
his favour, he prevailed with that prince, whoſe manners were very affable,
to ſtand godfather to his ſon, to whom he gave the name of Peter,
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted after the Flemiſh manner into Peter-kin, or Perkin. It was by
ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that Edward, among his other amorous adventures, had had a
ſecret correſpondence with Warbec's wife; and from this incident people
accounted for that reſemblance, which was afterwards remarked between young
Perkin and that monarch<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon, p. 606.</note>. Some
years after the birth of this child, Warbec returned to Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay; where Perkin
his ſon remained not long, but by different accidents was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from place
to place, and his birth and fortunes became thereby unknown, and difficult to
be traced by the moſt careful enquiry. The variety of his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had
happily favoured the natural verſatility and ſagacity of his genius; and he
ſeemed to be a youth perfectly fitted to act any part, or aſſume any
character. In this light he had been repreſented to the dutcheſs of
Burgundy, who, ſtruck with the concurrence of ſo many circumſtances
ſuited to her purpoſe, deſired to be made acquainted with the perſon,
on whom ſhe began already to ground her hopes of ſucceſs. 
<note place="margin">His impoſture.</note> She found him to
exceed her moſt ſanguine expectations; ſo beautiful did he appear in his
perſon, ſo graceful in his air, ſo courtly in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, ſo full
of docility and good ſenſe in his behaviour and converſation. The
leſſons, which were neceſſary to be taught him, in order to his
perſonating the duke of York, were ſoon learned by a youth of ſuch quick
comprehenſion; but as the ſeaſon ſeemed not then favourable for his
enterprize, Margaret, in order the better to conceal him, ſent him, under the
care of Lady Brampton, into Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, where he remained a year, unknown to all
the world.</p>
               <p>THE war, which was then ready to break out between France and
England, ſeemed to afford a proper opportunity for the diſcovery of this
new phaenomenon; and Ireland, which ſtill retained its attachments to the
houſe of York, was pitched on as the proper place for his firſt
appearance<note n="†" place="bottom">Polyd. Virg. p. 589.</note>. He
landed at Corke; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0429000101:41"/> aſſuming the name of
Richard Plantagenet, drew to him partizans among that ignorant and credulous
people. He wrote letters to the earls of Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond and Kildare, inviting them
to join his party: He diſperſed every where the ſtrange intelligence of
his eſcape from his uncle Richard's cruelty; and men, fond of every thing new
and wonderful, began to make him the general ſubject of their diſcourſe,
and even the object of their favour.</p>
               <p>THE news ſoon reached France; and Charles, prompted by the
private ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the dutcheſs of Burgundy, and the intrigues of
one Frion, a ſecretary of Henry, who had deſerted his ſervice, ſent
Perkin an invitation to repair to him at Paris. He received him with all the
marks of regard due to the duke of York; ſettled on him a handſome
penſion, aſſigned him magnificent lodgings, and in order to provide at
once for his dignity and ſecurity, gave him a guard for his perſon, of
which lord Congreſall accepted the office of captain. The French courtiers
readily embraced a fiction, which their ſovereign thought it his intereſt
to adopt: Perkin, both by his deportment and perſon, ſupported the
prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, which was ſpread abroad of his royal pedigree: And
the whole kingdom was full of the accompliſhments, as well as ſingular
adventures and misfortunes, of the young Plantagenet. Wonders of this nature
are commonly augmented at a diſtance. From France, the admiration and
credulity diffuſed themſelves into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: Sir George Neville, Sir John
Taylor, and a hundred gentlemen more came to Paris, in order to offer their
ſervice to the ſuppoſed duke of York, and to ſhare his fortunes: And
the impoſtor had now the appearance of a court at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him, and began to
entertain hopes of final ſucceſs in his undertakings.</p>
               <p>WHEN peace was concluded between France and England at
Eſtaples, Henry applied to have Perkin put into his hands; but Charles,
reſolute not to betray a young man, of whatever birth, whom he had invited
into his kingdom, would agree only to diſmiſs him. The pretended
Plantagenet retired to the dutcheſs of Burgundy in Flanders, and craving her
protection and aſſiſtance, offered to lay before her all the proofs of
that birth, to which he laid claim.

aſſigned him an equipage, ſuited to his pretended birth; appointed him a
guard of thirty halberdiers; engaged every one to pay court to him; and on all
occaſions honoured him with the appellation of the <hi>White Roſe of
England.</hi> The Flemings, moved by the authority, which Margaret, both from
her rank and perſonal character, enjoyed among them, readily adopted the
fiction of Perkin's royal deſcent: No ſurmize of his true birth was as yet
heard of: Little contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was made to the prevailing opinion: And the
Engliſh, from their great communication with the natives of the Low
Countries, were every day more and more prepoſſeſſed in favour of the
impoſtor.</p>
               <p>IT was not the populace alone of England, that gave credit to
Perkin's preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Men of the higheſt birth and quality, diſguſted
with Henry's government, by which they found the nobility depreſſed, began
to turn their eyes towards this new claimant, and ſome of them even entered
into a correſpondence with him. 
<note place="margin">and by many of the Engliſh nobility.</note>
Lord Fitzwater, Sir Simon Mountfort, Sir Thomas Thwaites betrayed their
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination towards him: Sir William Stanley himſelf, lord chamberlain, who
had been ſo active in raiſing Henry to the throne, moved either by blind
credulity or a reſtleſs ambition, entertained the project of a revolt in
favour of his enemy<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon, p. 608.</note>. Sir Robert
Clifford and William Barley were ſtill more open in their meaſures: They
went over to Flanders, offered their ſervice to Perkin, and were introduced
by the dutcheſs of Burgundy to his acquaintance. Clifford wrote back to
Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that he knew perfectly the perſon of Richard duke of York, that
this young man was undoubtedly that prince himſelf, and that no
circumſtance of his ſtory was expoſed to the leaſt difficulty. Such
poſitive intelligence, conveyed by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſuch high rank and
character, was ſufficient with many to put the matter beyond all queſtion,
and excited the wonder and attention even of the moſt indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. The whole
nation were held in ſuſpenſe; a regular conſpiracy was formed againſt
the King's authority; and a correſpondence ſettled between the
malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in Flanders and thoſe in England.</p>
               <p>THE King was well informed of all theſe particulars; but
agreeable to his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which was both cautious and reſolute, he
proceeded very deliberately, but ſteadily, in counter-working the projects of
his enemies. His firſt object was to aſcertain the death of the real duke
of York, and to confirm the opinion, which had always prevailed with regard to
that event. Four perſons had been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by Richard in the murder of his
nephews; Sir James Tirrel, to whom he had committed the government of the Tower
for that purpoſe, and who had ſeen the dead princes; Miles Forreſt and
John Dighton, who perpetrated the action; and the prieſt who buried the
bodies. Tirrel and Dighton alone were alive, and they agreed in the ſame
ſtory; but as the prieſt was dead, and as the bodies had 
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0429000101:43"/> been removed by Richard's orders from the place where they
were firſt interred, and could not now be found, it was not in Henry's power
to put the fact, ſo much as he wiſhed, beyond all doubt and
controverſy.</p>
               <p>HE met at firſt with more difficulty, but was in the end more
ſucceſsful, in detecting who this wonderful perſon was that thus boldly
advanced pretenſions to his crown. He diſperſed his ſpies all over
Flanders and England; he engaged many to pretend that they had embraced
Perkin's party; he directed them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate themſelves into the
conſidence of his friends; in proportion as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed intelligence of
any conſpirator, he bribed his retainers, his domeſtic ſervants, nay
ſometimes his confeſſor, and by theſe means traced up ſome other
confederate; Clifford himſelf he engaged by hopes of reward and pardon, to
betray the ſecrets committed to him; the more truſt he gave any of his
ſpies, the higher reſentment did he feign againſt them; ſome of them he
even cauſed to be excommunicated and publicly anathematized, in order the
better to procure them the confidence of his enemies: And in the iſſue, the
whole plan of the conſpiracy was laid clearly before him; and the whole
pedigree, adventures, life and converſation of the pretended duke of York.
This latter ſtory was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately publiſhed for the ſatisfaction of the
nation: The conſpirators he reſerved for a flower and more ſecure
vengeance.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1494</label> MEANWHILE, he remonſtrated
with the archduke Philip, on account of the countenance and protection, which
was afforded in his dominions to ſo infamous an impoſture; contrary to
treaties ſubſiſting between the ſovereigns, and to the mutual amity,
which had ſo long been maintained by the ſubjects of both ſtates.
Margaret had intereſt enough to get his applications rejected; under pretence
that Philip had no authority over the demeſnes of the dutcheſs dowager. And
the King, in reſentment of this injury, cut off all commerce with the Low
Countries, baniſhed the Flemings from England, and recalled his own
ſubjects from theſe provinces. Philip retaliated by like edicts; but Henry
knew, that ſo mutinous a people as the Flemings would not long bear, in
compliance with the humours of their prince, to be deprived of ſo beneficial
a branch of commerce as that which they carried on with England.</p>
               <p>HE had it in his power to inflict more effectual puniſhment on
his domeſtic enemies; and when his projects were ſufficiently matured, he
failed not to make them feel the effects of his reſentment. Almoſt in the
ſame inſtant, he arreſted Fitzwater, Mountfort, and Thwaites, together
with William Daubeney, Robert Ratcliff, Thomas Creſſenor, and Thomas
Aſtwood. All theſe were arraigned, convicted, and condemned for high
treaſon, in adhering and promiſing aid to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin. <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0429000101:44"/>
Mountfort, Ratcliff, and Daubeney were immediately executed: Fitzwater was
ſent over to Calais, and retained in cuſtody; but having practiſed on his
keeper for an eſcape, he ſoon after underwent the ſame fate. The reſt
were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, together with William Worſeley, dean of St. Paul's, and
ſome others, who had been accuſed and examined, but not brought to public
trial<note n="*" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil, p. 592.</note>.</p>
               <p>GREATER and more ſolemn preparations were eſteemed
requiſite for the trial of Stanley, lord chamberlain, whoſe authority in
the nation, whoſe domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic connexions with the King, as well as his former
great ſervices, ſeemed to ſecure him againſt any accuſation or
puniſhment. Clifford was directed to come over privately to England, and to
throw himſelf at the King's feet, while placed at the council table; craving
pardon for his paſt offences, and offering to attone for them by any
ſervices, which ſhould be required of him. Henry told him, that the beſt
proof he could give of penitence, and the only ſervice he could now render
him, was the full confeſſion of his guilt, and the diſcovery of all his
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices, however diſtinguiſhed by rank or character. Encouraged by
this exhortation, Clifford accuſed Stanley then preſent, as his chief
abettor; and offered to lay before the council the whole proofs of his guilt.
Stanley himſelf could not diſcover more ſurprize than was affected by
Henry on this occaſion. He received the intelligence as abſolutely falſe
and incredible; that a man, to whom he was, in a great meaſure, beholden for
his crown, and even for his life; a man, to whom, by every honour and favour,
he had endeavoured to expreſs his gratitude; whoſe brother, the earl of
Derby, was the King's father-in-law; to whom he had even committed the truſt
of his perſon, by creating him lord cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain: That this man, enjoying his
full confidence and affection, not actuated by any motive of diſcontent or
apprehenſion, ſhould engage in a conſpiracy againſt him. Clifford was
therefore exhorted to weigh well the conſequences of this accuſation; but
as he perſiſted in the ſame poſitive aſſeverations, Stanley was
committed to cuſtody, and ſoon after examined before the council<note n="†" place="bottom">Bacon, p. 611. Polyd. Virg. p. 593.</note>. He denied
not the guilt imputed to him by Clifford; he did not even endeavour much to
extenuate it; whether he thought that a frank and open confeſſion would
ſerve for an atonement, or truſted to his preſent connexions, and his
former ſervices, for pardon and ſecurity. 
<note place="margin">Trial and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of Stanley.</note> But
princes are often apt to regard great ſervices as a ground of jealouſy,
eſpecially if accompanied with a craving and reſtleſs diſpoſition, in
the perſon who has performed them. The general diſcontent alſo, and
mutinous humour of the people, ſeemed to require ſome great example of
ſeverity. And as Stanley was one of the moſt opulent ſubjects in the
kingdom, being poſſeſſed <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0429000101:45"/>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1495</label> of above three thouſand pounds a year in
land, and forty thouſand merks in plate and money, beſides other property
of great value, the proſpect of ſo rich a forfeiture was deemed no ſmall
motive in Henry for proceeding to extremity againſt him. 
<note place="margin">15th of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary.</note> After ſix weeks
delay, which was interpoſed in order to ſhew that the King was reſtrained
by doubts and ſcruples; he was brought to his trial, condemned, and
preſently after beheaded. Hiſtorians are not well agreed with regard to the
crime which was proved againſt him. The general report is, that he ſhould
have ſaid in confidence to Clifford, that, if he was ſure the young man,
who appeared in Flanders, was really ſon to King Edward, he never would bear
arms againſt him. This ſentiment might diſguſt Henry as implying a
preference of the houſe of York to that of Lancaſter, but could ſcarcely
be the ground, even in thoſe arbitrary times, of a ſentence of high
treaſon againſt Stanley. It is more probable, therefore, what is
aſſerted by ſome hiſtorians, that he had expreſsly engaged to
aſſiſt Perkin, and had actually ſent him ſome ſupply of money.</p>
               <p>THE fate of Stanley made great impreſſion on the whole
kingdom, and ſtruck all Perkin's retainers with the deepeſt diſmay. From
Clifford's deſertion, they found that all their ſecrets were diſcovered;
and as it appeared, that Stanley, even while he ſeemed to live in the
greateſt confidence with the King, had been continually ſurrounded by
ſpies, who reported and regiſtered every action which he committed, nay,
every word which fell from him, a general diſtruſt took place, and all
mutual confidence was deſtroyed, even among the moſt intimate friends and
acquaintance. The jealous and ſevere temper of the King, together with his
great reputation for ſagacity and penetration, kept men in awe, and quelled
not only the movements of ſedition, but the very murmurs of faction. Libels,
however, crept out againſt Henry's perſon and adminiſtration; and being
greedily propagated, by every ſecret art, ſhowed that there ſtill
remained among the people a conſiderable root of diſcontent, which wanted
only a proper opportunity to diſcover itſelf.</p>
               <p>BUT Henry continued more intent on increaſing the terrors of
his people, than on gaining their affections. Truſting to the great
ſucceſs which attended him in all his enterprizes, he gave every day, more
and more, a looſe to his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious temper, and employed the arts of
perverted law and juſtice, in order to exact fines and compoſitions from
his people. Sir William Capel, alderman of London, was condemned on ſome
penal ſtatutes to pay the ſum of 2743 pounds, and was obliged to compound
for ſixteen hundred and fifteen. This was the firſt noted caſe of that
nature; but it became a precedent, which prepared the <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0429000101:46"/> way
for many others. The management, indeed, of theſe oppreſſive arts was the
great ſecret of the King's adminiſtration. While he depreſſed the
nobility, he exalted, and honoured and careſſed the lawyers; and by that
means both beſtowed authority on the laws, and was enabled, whenever he
pleaſed, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them to his own advantage. His government was
oppreſſive; but it was ſo much the leſs burthenſome, that, by
extending his own authority, and curbing the nobles, he became in reality the
ſole oppreſſor in his kingdom.</p>
               <p>AS Perkin found, that the King's authority gained ground daily
among the people, and that his own pretenſions were becoming obſolete, he
reſolved to attempt ſomething, which might revive the hopes and
expectations of his partizans. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gathered together a band of outlaws,
pirates, robbers, and neceſſitous perſons of all nations, to the number
of 600 men, he put to ſea with a reſolution of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deſcent in
England; and of exciting the common people to arms, ſince all his
correſpondence with the nobility was cut off by Henry's vigilance and
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity. Information being brought him, that the King had made a progreſs
to the north, he caſt anchor on the coaſt of Kent, and ſent ſome of his
retainers aſhore, who invited the country to join him. The gentlemen of Kent
gathered together ſome troops to oppoſe him; but they propoſed to do more
eſſential ſervice than by repelling the invaſion: They carried the
ſemblance of friendſhip to Perkin, and invited him to come himſelf
aſhore, in order to take the command over them. But the wary youth,
obſerving that they had more order and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in their movements than
could be ſuppoſed in new levied forces, who had taken arms againſt
eſtabliſhed authority, refuſed to commit himſelf into their hands; and
the Kentiſh troops deſpairing of ſucceſs in their ſtratagem, ſet
upon ſuch of his retainers, as were already landed; and beſides ſome who
were ſlain and ſome who eſcaped, they took an hundred and fifty
priſoners. Theſe were tried and condemned; and all of them executed, by
order from the King, who was reſolved to uſe no mixture of lenity towards
men of ſuch deſperate fortunes<note n="*" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil, p.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A Parliament.</note> THIS year a Parliament
was ſummoned in England, and another in Ireland; and ſome remarkable laws
were paſſed in both countries. The Engliſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enacted, that no
perſon who ſhould aſſiſt in arms or otherwiſe the King for the time
being ſhould ever afterwards, either by courſe of law or act of
Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be attainted for ſuch an inſtance of obedience. This ſtatute
might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſome blame, as favourable to uſurpers; were there
any preciſe rules, which always, even during the moſt factious times, could
determine the true ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, and render every one inexcuſable, who
did not ſubmit to him. But as the titles of princes are then the great
ſubject of diſpute, and each party pleads <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0429000101:47"/> topics in
their own favour, it ſeems but equitable to ſecure thoſe who act in
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of eſtabliſhed tranquillity, an object at all times of undoubted
benefit and importance. Henry, conſcious of his diſputed title, promoted
this law in order to ſecure his partizans againſt all events; but as he had
himſelf obſerved a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent practice with regard to Richard's adherents,
he had reaſon to apprehend, that, during the violence which uſually
enſues on public convulſions, his example, rather than his law, would, in
caſe of a new revolution, be followed by his enemies. And the attempt to bind
the legiſlature itſelf, by preſcribing rules to future Parliaments, was
plainly contradictory to the fundamental principles of political
government.</p>
               <p>THIS Parliament alſo paſſed an act, impowering the King to
levy by courſe of law, all the ſums which any perſon had agreed to pay by
way of benevolence: A ſtatute, by which that arbitrary method of taxation was
directly authorized and juſtified.</p>
               <p>THE King's authority appeared equally prevalent and
uncontrolable in Ireland. Sir Edward Poynings had been ſent over with ſome
troops into that country, with an intention of quelling the partizans of the
houſe of York, and of reducing the natives to ſubjection. He was not
ſupported with forces ſufficient for that important enterprize: The
Iriſh, by flying into their woods, and moraſſes, and mountains, in ſome
meaſure, eluded his efforts: But Poynings ſummoned a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at Dublin,
where he was more ſucceſsful. He paſſed that memorable ſtatute, which
ſtill bears his name, and which eſtabliſhes the authority of the
Engliſh government in Ireland. By this ſtatute, the Parliament of England
were empowered to make laws for Ireland; and no bill can be introduced into the
Iriſh parliament, unleſs it previouſly receive the ſanction of the
council of England.</p>
               <p>WHILE Henry's authority was thus eſtabliſhed throughout his
dominions, and general tranquillity prevailed, the whole continent was thrown
into combuſtion by the French invaſion of Italy, and by the rapid
ſucceſs which attended Charles in that raſh and ill-concerted enterprize.
The Italians, who had entirely loſt the uſe of arms, and who, in the
midſt of continual wars, had become every day more unwarlike, were
aſtoniſhed to meet with an enemy, that made the field of battle, not a
pompous tournament, but a ſcene of blood, and ſought at the hazard of their
own lives the death of their enemy. Their e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eminate troops were diſſipated every where on the approach of
the French army: Their beſt fortified cities opened their gates: Kingdoms and
ſtates were in an inſtant over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned: And thro' the whole length of Italy,
which the French penetrated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0429000101:48"/> reſiſtance, they
ſeemed rather to be taking quarters in their own country, than making
conqueſts over an enemy. The maxims, which the Italians, during that age,
followed in negotiations, were as ill calculated to ſupport their ſtates,
as the habits to which they were addicted in war. A treacherous, deceitful, and
inconſtant ſyſtem of politics prevailed; and even thoſe ſmall remains
of fidelity and honour, which were preſerved in the councils of the other
European princes, were ridiculed in Italy, as proofs of ignorance and
ruſticity. Ludovico, duke of Milan, who invited the French to invade Naples,
had never deſired nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected their ſucceſs; and was the firſt
alarmed at the proſperous iſſue of thoſe projects, which he himſelf
had concerted. By his intrigues a league was formed among ſeveral potentates
to oppoſe the progreſs of Charles's conqueſts and ſecure their own
independency. This league was compoſed of Ludovico himſelf, the pope,
Maximilian King of the Romans, Ferdinand of Spain, and the republic of Venice.
Henry too entered into the confederacy; but was not put to any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence or
trouble in conſequence of his engagements. The King of France, terrified by
ſo powerful a combination, retired from Naples with the greateſt part of
his army, and returned to France. The forces, which he left in his new
conqueſts, partly by the revolt of the inhabitants, partly by the invaſion
of the Spaniards, were ſoon after ſubdued; and the whole kingdom of Naples
ſuddenly returned to its allegiance under Ferdinand, ſon to Alphonſo, who
had been ſuddenly expelled by the irruption of the French. Ferdinand died
ſoon after; and left his uncle, Frederic, in peaceable poſſeſſion of
the throne.</p>

into Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but as he found it impoſſible to ſubſiſt himſelf
and his followers, while he remained in tranquillity, he ſoon after made an
attempt upon Ireland, which had always appeared forward to join every invader
of Henry's authority. But Poinings had now put the affairs of that iſland in
ſo good a poſture, that Perkin met with little ſucceſs; and being tired
of the ſavage life, which he was obliged to lead, while ſkulking among the
wild Iriſh, he bent his courſe towards Scotland, and preſented himſelf
to James the fourth, who then governed that kingdom. He had been previouſly
recommended to that prince by the King of France, who was diſguſted that
Henry had entered into the league againſt him; and this recommendation was
even ſeconded by Maximilian, who, tho' one of the confederates, ſtood on
ill terms with the King, on account of his prohibition of commerce with the Low
Countries.

The inſinuating addreſs and plauſible behaviour of the youth himſelf
ſeem even to have gained him credit and authority. James, whom years had not
yet taught diſtruſt and caution, was ſeduced to believe the ſtory of
Perkin's birth and adventures; and he carried his confidence ſo far as to
give him in marriage the lady Catherine Gordon, daughter of the Farl of
Huntley, and a near kinſwoman of his own; a young woman too, eminent for
virtue as well as beauty.</p>

ſubſiſted at that time a great jealouſy between the courts of England
and Scotland; and James was probably the more forward on that account to adopt
any fiction, which, he thought, might reduce his enemy to diſtreſs or
difficulty. He ſuddenly reſolved to make an inroad into England, attended
with ſome of the borderers; and he carried Perkin along with him, in hopes,
that the appearance of the pretended prince might raiſe an inſurrection in
the northern counties. Perkin himſelf diſperſt a manifeſto, where he
ſet forth his own ſtory, and craved the aſſiſtance of all his
ſubjects in expelling the uſurper, whoſe tyranny and
mal-adminiſtration, whoſe depreſſion of the nobility by the elevation
of mean perſons, whoſe oppreſſion of the people by multiplied
impoſitions and vexations, had juſtly, he ſaid, rendered him odious to
all men. But Perkin's pretenſions, attended by repeated diſappointments,
were now become ſtale in the eyes even of the populace; and the hoſtile
diſpoſitions, which ſubſiſted between the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, rendered a
prince, ſupported by the Scotch, but an unwelcome preſent to the Engliſh
nation. The ravages alſo, committed by the borderers, accuſtomed to licence
and diſorder, ſtruck a terror into all men; and made the people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
rather for repelling the invaders than for joining them. Perkin, that he might
ſupport his pretenſions to royal birth, feigned great compaſſion for
the miſery of his plundered ſubjects; and publickly remonſtrated with his
ally againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations exerciſed by the Scotch army<note n="*" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil, p. 598.</note>: But James told him, that he
doubted his concern was employed only in behalf of his enemy, and that he was
anxious to preſerve what never would belong to him. That prince now began to
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that his attempt would be fruitleſs; and hearing of an army, which
was on its march to attack him, he thought proper to retreat into his own
country.</p>
               <p>THE King diſcovered little anxiety to procure either
reparation or vengeance for this inſult committed on him by the Scotch
nation: His chief concern was to draw advantage from it, by the pretence which
it would afford him to levy impoſitions on his own ſubjects. He ſummoned
a Parliament, to whom he made bitter complaints againſt the irruption of the
Scotch, the abſurd impoſture which was countenanced by that nation, the
cruel devaſtation which they had ſpread over the northern counties, and the
complicated affront which had thus been offered both to the King and kingdom of
England. The Parliament made the expected return to this diſcourſe of the
King, by granting him a ſubſidy to the amount of 120,000 pounds, together
with two fifteenths. After making this grant, they were diſmiſſed.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1497</label> THE vote
of parliament for impoſing the tax was eaſily procured by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of
Henry; but he found it not ſo eaſy to levy the money upon his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
The people, who were acquainted with the immenſe treaſures amaſſed by
the King, could ill brook the new impoſitions raiſed on every ſlight
occaſion; and it is probable, that the flaw, which was univerſally known to
lie in his title, made his reign the more ſubject to inſurrections and
rebellions. 
<note place="margin">Inſurrection in the Weſt.</note> When the
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy began to be levied in Cornwal, the inhabitants, numerous and poor,
robuſt and courageous, murmured againſt a tax, occaſioned by a ſudden
inroad of the Scotch, from which they eſteemed themſelves entirely
ſecure, and which had commonly been repelled by the force of the northern
counties. Their ill humour was farther incited by one Michael Joſeph, a
farrier of Bodmin, a notable, talking fellow, who, by thruſting himſelf
forward on every occaſion, and being loudeſt in every complaint againſt
the government, had acquired an authority among theſe rude people. Thomas
Flammoc too, a lawyer, who had become the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the neighbourhood,
encouraged the ſedition, by informing them, that the tax, tho' impoſed by
Parliament, was entirely illegal; that the northern nobility, by their tenures,
were obliged to defend the nation againſt the Scotch; and that if theſe new
impoſitions were tamely ſubmitted to, the avarice of Henry and of his
courtiers would ſoon render the burthen intolerable upon the nation. A
petition, he ſaid, muſt be delivered to the King, ſeconded by ſuch
force as would give it authority; and in order to procure the concurrence of
the reſt of the kingdom, care muſt be taken, by their orderly deportment,
to ſhew that they had nothing in view but the public good, and the redreſs
of all thoſe grievances, under which the people had ſo long laboured.</p>
               <p>ENCOURAGED by theſe ſpeeches, the multitude flocked
together, and armed themſelves with axes, bills, bows, and ſuch weapons as
country people are uſually poſſeſſed of. Flammoc and Joſeph were
choſen their leaders. They ſoon conducted the Corniſh through the county
of Devon, and reached that of Somerſet. At Taunton the inſurgents killed in
their fury an officious and eager commiſſioner for the ſubſidy, whom
they called the provoſt of Perin. When they reached Wells, they were joined
by lord Audley, a nobleman of an antient family, popular in his deportment, but
vain, ambitious, and reſtleſs in his temper. He had from the beginning
entertained a ſecret correſpondence with the firſt movers of the
inſurrection; and was now joyfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them as their leader. Proud
of the countenance given them by ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a nobleman, they puſhed
on their march; breathing deſtruction to the King's miniſters and
favourites, particularly Morton, now a cardinal, and Sir Reginald Bray, who
were deemed his moſt active inſtruments in all his oppreſſions.
Amidſt their rage againſt the adminiſtration, they carefully followed the
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0429000101:52"/> given them by their leaders; and as they met
with no reſiſtance, they committed, during their march, no violence or

               <p>THE inſurgents had been told by Flammoc, that the inhabitants
of Kent, as they had ever, during all ages, remained unſubdued, and had even
maintained their independancy during the Norman conqueſt, would ſurely
embrace their party, and declare themſelves for a cauſe, which was no other
than that of public good and general liberty. But the Kentiſh people had very
lately diſtinguiſhed themſelves by repelling Perkin's invaſion; and
having received from the King many gracious acknowledgments for this ſervice,
their affections were, by that means, much conciliated to his government. It
was eaſy therefore, for the earl of Kent, lord Abergavenny, and lord Cobham,
who poſſeſſed great authority in thoſe parts, to retain the people in
obedience; and the Corniſh rebels, though they pitched their camp near
Eltham, at the very gates of London, and invited all the people to join them,
got reinforcement from no quarter. There wanted not diſcontent every where,
but no one would take part in ſo raſh and ill-concerted an enterprize; and
the ſituation in which the King's affairs then ſtood, diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged even
the boldeſt and moſt daring.</p>
               <p>HENRY, in order to oppoſe the Scotch, had already levied an
army, which he put under the command of lord Daubeney, the chamberlain; and
ſo ſoon as he heard of the Corniſh inſurrection, he ordered it to march
ſouthwards, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the rebels. Not to leave the northern frontier
defenceleſs, he diſpatched thither the earl of Surry, who ſummoned out
the forces on the borders, and made head againſt the enemy. Henry found here
the concurrence of the three moſt fatal incidents, which can befal a
monarchy; a foreign enemy, a domeſtic rebellion, and a pretender to his
throne; but he enjoyed great reſources in his army and treaſure, and
ſtill more, in the intrepidity and courage of his own temper. He gave not,
however, immediately full ſcope to his military ſpirit. On other
occaſions, he had always haſtened to a deciſion, and it was an uſual
ſaying with him, <hi>that he deſired but to ſee his rebels:</hi> But as
the Corniſh inſurgents behaved in an inoffenſive manner, and committed no
ſpoil on the country, as they received no acceſſion of force on their
march or in their encampment, and as ſuch haſty and popular tumults might
be expected to diminiſh every moment by delay, he took poſt in London, and
carefully prepared the means of enſuring the victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Battle of Blackheath.</note> AFTER all his
forces were collected, he divided them into three bodies, and marched out to
aſſail the enemy. The firſt body, commanded by the earl of Oxford, and
under him by the earls of Eſſex and Suffolk, were appointed to place
themſelves behind the hill on which the rebels were encamped: The ſecond 
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0429000101:53"/> and moſt conſiderable Henry put under the command of
lord Daubeney, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to attack the enemy in front, and bring on the
action. The third, he kept as a body of reſerve about his own perſon, and
took poſt in St. George's field; where he ſecured the city, and could
eaſily, as occaſion ſerved, either reſtore the fight or finiſh the
victory. 
<note place="margin">22d of June.</note> To put the enemy off their
guard, he had ſpread a report that he was not to attack them till ſome days
after; and the better to confirm them in this opinion, he began not the action
till near the evening. Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beney beat a detachment of the rebels from
Deptford-bridge; and before the main body could be in order to receive him, he
had gained the aſcent of the hill, and placed himſelf in array before them.
They were very formidable for their numbers, being ſixteen thouſand
ſtrong, and were not defective in valour; but being tumultuary troops, ill
armed, and unprovided of cavalry or artillery, they were but an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual match
for the King's forces. Daubeney began the attack with courage, and even with a
contempt of the enemy, which had almoſt proved fatal to him. He ruſhed into
the midſt of them, and was taken priſoner; but ſoon after was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by his own troops. After ſome reſiſtance, the rebels were broke, and put
to flight<note n="*" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil, p. 601.</note>. Lord Audley,
Flammoc, and Joſeph, their leaders, were taken, and all three executed. The
latter ſeemed even to exult in his end, and boaſted, with a prepoſterous
ambition, that he would make a figure in hiſtory. The rebels, being
ſurrounded on every ſide by the King's troops, were almoſt all made
priſoners; and immediately diſmiſſed without farther puniſhment.
Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that Henry was ſatisfied with the victims who had fallen in the
field, and who amounted to near two thouſand, or that he pitied the ignorance
and ſimplicity of the multitude, or favoured them on account of their
inoffenſive behaviour, or was pleaſed that they had never, during their
inſurrection, diſputed his title, and had ſhewn no attachment to the
houſe of York, the moſt capital crime of which in his eyes they could have
been guilty.</p>
               <p>THE Scottiſh King was not idle during theſe commotions in
England. He levied a conſiderable army, and ſat down before the caſtle of
Norham in North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umberland; but found that place, by the precaution of Fox,
biſhop of Durham, ſo well provided both in men and ammunition, that he made
little or no progreſs in the ſiege. Hearing that Surrey had collected
ſome forces and was advancing upon him, he retreated backwards into his own
country, and left the frontiers expoſed to the inroads of the Engliſh
general, who beſieged and took Aiton, a ſmall caſtle that lies a few
miles beyond Berwic. Theſe unſucceſsful or frivolous attempts on both
ſides prognoſticated a ſpeedy end to the war; and Henry,
not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his ſuperior force, was no leſs deſirous than James of
terminating the <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0429000101:54"/> differences between the nations. Not to
depart, however, from his dignity, by making the firſt advances towards
peace, he employed in this friendly office Peter Hialas, a man of addreſs and
learning, who had come to him as ambaſſador from Ferdinand and Iſabella,
and who was charged with a commiſſion of nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating the marriage of the
infanta Catherine, their daughter, with Arthur prince of Wales<note n="*" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil, p. 603.</note>.</p>
               <p>HIALAS took a journey northwards, and offered his mediation
between James and Henry, as miniſter of a prince, who was in alliance with
both potentates. Commiſſioners were ſoon appointed to meet, and confer of
the terms of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation. The firſt demand of the Engliſh was, that
Perkin ſhould be put into their hands; but James replied, that he himſelf
was no judge of Perkin's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, but having received him as a
ſupplicant, and promiſed him protection, he was determined not to betray a
man, whatever he was, who had truſted to his good faith and his generoſity.
The next demand of the Engliſh met with no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reception: They required
reparation for the ravages committed by the late inroads into England: The
Scotch commiſſioners replied, that the ſpoils were like water ſpilt
upon the ground, which never could be recovered, and that Henry's ſubjects
were better able to bear the loſs than their maſter's to repair it. Henry's
commiſſioners next propoſed, that the two Kings ſhould have an
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view at Newcaſtle, in order to adjuſt all differences; but James
ſaid, that he meant to treat of a peace, not to go a begging for it. 
<note place="margin">Truce with Scotland.</note> Leſt the
conferences ſhould break off altogether without effect, a truce was concluded
for ſome months; and James perceiving, that while Perkin remained in
Scotland, he never would enjoy a ſolid peace with Henry, privately deſired
him to depart the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>ACCESS was now barred Perkin into the low countries; his uſual
retreat in all his diſappointments. The Flemiſh merchants, who felt
ſeverely the loſs reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their want of commerce with England,
had made ſuch intereſt in the arch-duke's council, that commiſſioners
were ſent to London, in order to treat of an accommodation. The Flemiſh
court agreed that all Engliſh rebels ſhould be excluded the low countries;
and in this prohibition the demeſnes of the dutcheſs dowager were
expreſsly comprehended. When this principal article was agreed to, all the
other terms were eaſily adjuſted. A treaty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce was finiſhed,
which was favourable to the Flemings, and to which they gave long the
appellation of <hi>Intercurſus magnus,</hi> the great treaty. And when the
Engli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0429000101:55"/> PERKIN was a Fleming by deſcent, tho'
born in England; and it might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be doubted, whether he was
comprehended in the treaty between the two nations: But as he muſt
diſmiſs all his Engliſh retainers if he took ſhelter in the low
countries, and as he was ſure of a cold reception, if not bad uſage, among
a people who were determined to keep on terms of friendſhip with the court of
England; he thought fit rather to hide himſelf, during ſome time, in the
wilds and faſtneſſes of Ireland. Impatient however of a retreat, which
was both diſagreeable and dangerous, he held conſultations with his
followers, Herne, Skelton, and Aſtley, three broken tradeſmen; and by their
advice, reſolved to try the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Corniſh, whoſe mutinous
diſpoſition, notwithſtanding the King's lenity, ſtill ſubſiſted,
after the ſuppreſſion of their rebellion. No ſooner did he appear at
Bodmin in Cornwal, than the populace, to the number of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men,
flocked to his ſtandard; and Perkin, elated with this appearance of
ſucceſs, took on him, for the firſt time, the appellation of Richard the
fourth, King of England. Not to ſuffer the expectations of his followers to
languiſh, he preſented himſelf before Exeter; and by many fair
promiſes, invited that city to join his cauſe. Finding that the inhabitants
ſhut their gates againſt him, he laid ſiege to the place; but being
unprovided of artillery, ammunition, and of every thing requiſite for that
attempt, he made no progreſs in his undertaking. Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers were ſent
to the King, informing him of this inſurrection; and the citizens meanwhile
were determined to hold out to the laſt extremity, in expectation of
receiving ſuccour from the known vigilance of that monarch.</p>
               <p>WHEN Henry was informed, that Perkin was landed in England, he
expreſſed great joy, and prepared himſelf with alacrity to attack him, in
hopes of being able, at laſt, to put a period to a pretenſion, which had
ſo long given him vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and inquietude. All the courtiers, ſenſible
that their activity on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion would be the moſt acceptable
ſervice which they could render the King, prepared themſelves for the
enterprize, and forwarded his preparations. The lords Daubeney, and Broke, with
Sir Rice ap Thomas, haſtened forward with a ſmall body of troops to the
relief of Exeter. The earl of Devonſhire, and the moſt conſiderable
gentlemen in the country of that name, took arms of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and marched
to join the King's generals. The duke of Buckingham put himſelf at the head
of a troop of young nobility and gentry, who ſerved as vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers, and who
longed for an opportunity of diſplaying their courage and their loyalty. The
King himſelf prepared to follow with a conſiderable army; and thus all
England ſeemed united againſt a pretender, who had at firſt engaged their
attention, and divided their affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0429000101:56"/> PERKIN, informed of theſe great
preparations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> immediately broke up the ſiege of Exeter, and retired to
Taunton. Tho' his followers now amounted to the number of near ſeven
thouſand men, and ſeemed ſtill reſolute to defend his cauſe, he
himſelf deſpaired of ſucceſs, and ſecretly withdrew to the
ſanctuary of Beuley in the new foreſt. The Corniſh rebels ſubmitted
themſelves to the King's mercy, and found that it was not yet exhauſted in
their behalf. Except a few perſons of deſperate fortunes, who were
executed, and ſome others who were ſeverely fined, all the reſt were
diſmiſt with impunity. The Lady Catherine Gordon, wife to Perkin, fell into
the conqueror's hands, and was treated with a generoſity, which does him
honour. He ſoothed her mind with many tokens of regard, placed her in a
reputable ſtation about the queen, and aſſigned her a penſion, which
ſhe enjoyed even under his ſucceſſor.</p>
               <p>HENRY next deliberated what courſe to take with Perkin
himſelf. Some coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled him to make the privileges of the church yield to
reaſons of ſtate, to take him by violence from the ſanctuary, to inflict
on him the puniſhment due to his temerity, and thus at once to put an end to
an impoſture which had long diſturbed the government, and which the
credulity of the people and the artifices of male-contents were ſtill capable
of reviving. But the King deemed not the matter of ſuch importance as to
merit ſo violent a remedy. 
<note place="margin">Perkin taken priſoner.</note> He employed
ſome perſons to deal with Perkin, and perſwade him, under promiſe of
pardon, to deliver himſelf into the King's hands<note n="*" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil, p. 606.</note>. The King conducted him in a
ſpecies of mock triumph to London. As Perkin paſſed along the road, and
through the ſtreets of that city, men of all ranks flocked about him, and the
populace treated with the higheſt deriſion his fallen fortunes. They
ſeemed deſirous of revenging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their inſults for the
ſhame which their former belief of his impoſtures had thrown upon them.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1498</label> Tho' the eyes of the nation were generally
opened with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Perkin's real parentage and ſtation, Henry thought
proper to require of him a confeſſion of his life and adventures; and he
ordered the account of the whole to be publiſhed ſoon after for the
ſatisfaction of the public. But as his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to decency made him
ſuppreſs entirely the ſhare which the dutcheſs of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy had had in
contriving and conducting the impoſture, the people, who knew that ſhe had
been the chief inſtrument in the whole affair, were inclined, on account of
the ſilence on that head, to pay leſs credit to the authenticity of the
narrative.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1499</label> BUT Perkin, tho' his life was
granted him, was ſtill retained in cuſtody; and keepers were appointed to
guard him. Impatient of confinement, he broke looſe from his keepers, and
flying to the ſanctuary of Shyne, put himſelf into the hands 
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0429000101:57"/> of the prior of that monaſtery. The prior had obtained
great credit by his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of ſanctity; and he prevailed with the King
again to grant a pardon to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin. But in order to reduce him to ſtill
greater contempt, he was ſet in the ſtocks Weſtminſter and at
Cheapſide, and obliged in both places to read aloud to the people the
confeſſion which had been formerly publiſhed in his name. He was thrown
into the Tower, where his habits of reſtleſs intrigue and enterprize
ſtill followed him. He inſinuated himſelf into the intimacy of four
ſervants of Sir John Digby, lieutenant of the Tower; and by their means,
opened a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the earl of Warwic, who was confined to the
ſame priſon. That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate prince, who had from his earlieſt infancy
been ſhut up from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of men, and who was ignorant even of the
moſt common affairs of life, had fallen into a ſimplicity which made him
ſuſceptible of any impreſſions. The continued dread alſo of the more
violent effects of Henry's tyranny, joined to the natural love of liberty,
engaged him to embrace a project for his eſcape, by the murder of the
lieutenant; and Perkin offered to conduct the whole enterprize. The
conſpiracy eſcaped not the King's vigilance: It was even very generally
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that the ſcheme was laid by himſelf, in order to draw Perkin and
Warwic into the ſnare: But the ſubſequent execution of two of Digby's
ſervants for the contrivance ſeems to clear the King of that imputation,
which was indeed founded more on the general idea entertained of his character,
than on any poſitive evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Perkin exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</note> PERKIN, by this new
attempt, after ſo many enormities, had rendered himſelf totally unworthy of
mercy; and he was accordingly arraigned, condemned, and ſoon after hanged at
Tyburn, perſiſting ſtill in the confeſſion of his impoſture<note n="*" place="bottom">Stow, Baker, Speed, Biondi, Holingſhed, Bacon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some
late writers have been ſo whimſical as to doubt, whether Perkin was an
impoſtor, and even to aſſert him to be the real Richard Plantagenet, duke
of York. But to refute this fancy, we need but reflect on the few following
particulars. 1. Had not the queen mother, and the other heads of the York
party, been fully aſſured of the death of both the young princes, would
they have agreed to call over the earl of Richmond, the head of the
Lancaſtrian party, and marry him to the princeſs Flizabeth? 2. The ſtory
told conſtantly by Perkin of his eſcape is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly incredible, that
thoſe who were ſent to murder his brother took pity on him, and granted him
his liberty. 3. What became of him during the courſe of ſeven years, from
his ſuppoſed death till his appearance in Ireland in 1491? Why was not the
queen mother, the dutcheſs of Burgundy, and the other friends of the family
applied to, during that time, for his ſupport and education? 4. Tho' the
dutcheſs of Burgundy at laſt acknowledged him for her nephew, ſhe had
loſt all pretence to authority by her former acknowledgment and ſupport of
Lambert Simnel, an avowed impoſtor. It is remarkable, that Mr. Carte, in
order to preſerve the weight of the dutcheſs's teſtimony, in favour of
Perkin, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes entirely this material fact. A remarkable effect of
party prejudices, and the author's deſire of blackening Henry the ſeventh,
whoſe hereditary title to the crown was defective. 5. Perkin himſelf
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his impoſture more than once, and read his confeſſion
before the whole people. It is pretended that this confeſſion was drawn
from him by torture; but no antient hiſtorian gives any ground for this
ſurmiſe. 6. He renewed his confeſſion at the foot of the gibbet on
which he was executed. 7. After Henry the eighth's acceſſion, the titles of
the houſe of York and Lancaſter were fully confounded, and there was no
longer any neceſſity for defending Henry the ſeventh and his title; yet
all the hiſtorians of that time, when the events were recent, ſome of
theſe hiſtorians too, ſuch as Sir Thomas More, of the higheſt
authority, agree in treating Perkin as an impoſtor.</note>. 
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0429000101:58"/> It happened about that very time, that one Wilford, a
cordwainer's ſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the ſurprizing credit which had been
given to other impoſtures, had undertaken to perſonate the earl of Warwic;
and a prieſt had even ventured from the pulpit to recommend his cauſe to
the people, who ſeemed ſtill to retain a propenſity to adopt it. This
incident ſerved Henry as an apology for his ſeverity towards that
unfortunate prince. He was brought to trial, and accuſed, not of contriving
his eſcape, (for as he was committed for no crime, the deſire of liberty
muſt have been regarded as natural and innocent) but of forming deſigns to
diſturb the government, and raiſe an inſurrection among the people. 
<note place="margin">The earl of Warwic exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">21ſt of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.</note> Warwic
confeſſed the indictment, was condemned, and the ſentence was executed
upon him.</p>
               <p>THIS violent tyranny, the great ſtain of Henry's reign, by
which he deſtroyed the laſt remaining male of the line of Plantagenet,
begot great diſcontent among the people, who ſaw an unhappy prince, that
had long been deprived of all the privileges of his high birth, even cut off
from the common benefits of nature, now at laſt deprived of life itſelf,
merely for reſiſting that oppreſſion under which he laboured. In vain
did Henry endeavour to alleviate the odium of this guilt, by ſharing it with
his ally, Ferdinand of Arragon, who, he ſaid, had ſcrupled to give his
daughter Catherine in marriage to Arthur, while any prince of the houſe of
York remained alive. Men, on the contrary, felt higher indignation at ſeeing
a young prince ſacrificed, not to law and juſtice, but to the jealous
politics of two ſubtle and crafty tyrants.</p>
               <p>BUT tho' theſe diſcontents feſtered in the minds of men,
they were ſo checked by Henry's watchful policy and ſteady ſeverity, that
they appeared not to weaken his government; and foreign princes, deeming his
throne now entirely ſecure, payed him rather the greater courtſhip and
attention. The arch-duke Philip, in particular, deſired an interview with the
King; and this monarch, who had paſſed over to Calais, agreed to meet him
at St. Peter's church near that city. The arch-duke, on his approaching the
King, made haſte to alight, and offered to hold Henry's ſtirrup; a mark of
condeſcenſion, which that prince would not admit of. He called the King
<hi>father, patron, protector;</hi> and by his whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour expreſſed a
ſtrong deſire of conciliating the friendſhip of England. The 
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0429000101:59"/> duke of Orleans had ſucceeded to the kingdom of France
under the appellation of Lewis the twelfth; and having carried his arms into
Italy, and ſubdued the dutchy of Milan, his progreſs begot jealouſy in
Maximilian, Philip's father, as well as in Ferdinand, his father-in-law. By the
council, therefore, of theſe monarchs, the young prince endeavoured by every
art to acquire the amity of Henry, whom they regarded as the chief counterpoize
to the greatneſs of France. No particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar plan however of alliance ſeems
to have been concerted between theſe two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their interview: All
paſſed in general profeſſions of affection and regard; at leaſt, in
remote projects of a cloſer union, by the future intermarriages of their
children, who were then in a ſtate of infancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1500</label> THE pope too, Alexander the
ſixth, neglected not the friendſhip of a monarch, whoſe reputation was
ſpread all over Europe. He ſent a nuntio to England, who exhorted the King
to take part in the great alliance projected for the recovery of the Holy Land,
and to lead in perſon his forces againſt the Turk. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral frenzy for
croiſadoes was now entirely exhauſted in Europe; but it was ſtill thought
a neceſſary piece of decency to pretend zeal for thoſe pious enterprizes.
Henry regreted the diſtance of his ſituation, which rendered it
inconvenient for him to expoſe his perſon in defence of the chriſtian
cauſe. He promiſed, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his utmoſt aſſiſtance by aids and
contributions; and rather than the pope ſhould go alone to the holy wars,
unaccompanied by any monarch, he even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to overlook all other
conſiderations, and to attend him in perſon. He only required as a
neceſſary condition, that all differences ſhould be previouſly
compoſed among chriſtian princes, and that ſome ſea-port towns in Italy
ſhould be put into his hands for his retreat and ſecurity. It was eaſy to
conclude from this anſwer, that Henry had determined with himſelf not to
intermeddle in any wars againſt the Turk: But as a great name, without any
real aſſiſtance, is ſometimes of ſervice, the knights of Rhodes, who
were at that time eſteemed the bulwark of Chriſtendom, choſe the King
protector of their order.</p>
               <p>BUT the prince, whoſe alliance Henry valued the moſt, was
that of Ferdinand of Arragon, whoſe vigorous and ſteddy policy, always
attended with ſucceſs, had rendered him, in many reſpects, the moſt
conſiderable monarch in Europe. There was alſo a remarkable ſimilarity of
character between theſe two princes: Both were full of craft, intrigue, and
deſign; and tho' a reſemblance of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be a ſlender foundation of
confidence and friendſhip, where the intereſts of the parties in the
leaſt interfere; yet ſuch was the ſituation of Henry and Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand, that
no jealouſy ever on any occaſion aroſe between them.

the eſpouſals were at laſt, by means of the pope's diſpenſation,
concluded between the parties: An event, which was afterwards attended with the
moſt important conſequences.</p>

was alſo, in the next age, productive of great events: The marriage of
Margaret, the King's eldeſt daughter, with James King of Scotland. This
alliance had been negotiated during three years, tho' interrupted by ſeveral
broils; and Henry hoped, from the completion of it, to remove all ſource of
diſcord with that neighbouring king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by whoſe animoſity England had
been ſo often infeſted. When this marriage was deliberated on in the
Engliſh council, ſome objected, that England might, by means of that
alliance, fall under the dominion of Scotland. 
<q rend="inline">"No;" replied Henry, "Scotland, in that event,
would only become an acceſſion to England."</q>

proſperous events, the King met with a domeſtic calamity, which made not
ſuch impreſſion on him as it merited. His queen died in child-bed; and
the infant lived not long after. This princeſs was deſervedly a great
favourite of the nation; and the general affection for her encreaſed, on
account of the harſh treatment, which, it was thought, ſhe met with from
her conſort.</p>
               <p>THE ſituation of the King's affairs, both at home and abroad,
was now, in every reſpect, very deſirable. All the efforts of the European
princes, both in war and negotiation, were turned to the ſide of Italy; and
the various events, which there aroſe, made Henry's alliance be courted by
every party, and yet intereſted him ſo little as never to touch him with
concern or anxiety. His cloſe connexions with Spain and Scotland enſured
his tranquillity; and his continued ſucceſſes over domeſtic enemies,
owing to the prudence and vigour of his conduct, had reduced the people to
entire ſubmiſſion and obedience. 
<note place="margin">Oppreſſions of the people.</note> Henry
therefore, uncontrouled by apprehenſion or oppoſition of any kind, gave
full ſcope to his natural propenſity; and avarice, which had ever been his
predominant paſſion, being encr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aſed by age, and encouraged by abſolute authority, broke all
reſtraints of ſhame or juſtice. He had found two miniſters, Empſon
and Dudley, perfectly qualified to ſecond his rapacious and tyrannical
inclinations, and prey <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0429000101:61"/> upon his defenceleſs people.
Theſe Inſtruments of oppreſſion were both lawyers, the firſt of mean
birth, of brutal manners, of an unrelenting temper; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond better born,
better educated, and better bred, but equally unjuſt, ſevere, and
inflexible. By their knowledge in the law, theſe men were qualified to
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the forms of juſtice to the oppreſſion of the innocent; and the
formidable authority of the King ſupported them in all their iniquities.</p>
               <p>IT was their uſual practice to obſerve ſo far the
appearance of law as to give indictments to thoſe whom they intended to
oppreſs: Upon which the perſons were committed to priſon, but never
brought to trial; and were at laſt obliged to recover their liberty, by
paying heavy fines and ranſoms, which were called mitigations and
compoſitions. By degrees, the very appearance of law was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected: They
ſent forth their precepts to attach men, and ſummon them before
themſelves and ſome others, at their private houſes, in a court of
commiſſion; where, in a ſummary manner, without trial or jury, arbitrary
decrees were iſſued, both in pleas of the crown and controverſies between
private parties. Juries themſelves, when ſummoned, proved but ſmall
ſecurity to the ſubject; being brow-beat by theſe oppreſſors; nay,
fined, impriſoned, and puniſhed, if they gave ſentence againſt the
inclination of the miniſters. The whole ſyſtem of the feudal law, which
then prevailed, was turned into a ſcheme of oppreſſion. Even the King's
wards, after they came to full age, were not ſuffered to enter in
poſſeſſion of their lands without paying exorbitant fines. Men were
alſo haraſſed with informations of intruſion upon ſcarce colourable
titles. When an outlawry in a perſonal action was iſſued againſt any
man, he was not allowed to purchaſe his charter of pardon, except on the
payment of a great ſum; and if he refuſed the compoſition required of
him, the ſtrict law, which, in ſuch caſes, allows for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of goods,
was rigorouſly inſiſted on. Nay, without any colour of law, the half of
men's lands and rents were ſeized during two years, as a penalty in caſe of
outlawry. But the chief inſtrument of oppreſſion, employed by theſe
miniſters, were the penal Statutes, which, without conſideration of rank,
quality, or ſervices, were ſtrictly put in execution againſt all men:
Spies, informers, and inquiſitors were rewarded and encouraged in every
corner of the kingdom: And no difference was made whether the ſtatute was
beneficial or hurtful, recent or obſolete, poſſible or impoſſible to
be executed. The ſole end of the King and his miniſters was to amaſs
money, and bring every one under the laſh of their authority<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon, 629, 30. Hollingſhed, p. 504. Polyd. Virg. p. 613,

and iniquitous adminiſtration, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, it may ſafely be affirmed,
were conſiderable loſers by the ancient privilege, which ſecured them
from all taxations and impoſitions, except ſuch as were levied by their own
conſent. Had the King been empowered to lay on general taxes at his
pleaſure, he would naturally have abſtained from theſe oppreſſive
expedients, which deſtroyed all ſecurity in private property, and begot an
univerſal diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thro' the nation. In vain did the people look for
protection from the Parliament, which was pretty frequently ſummoned during
this reign. <label type="milestone">

ſo overawed, that, at this very time, during the greateſt rage of Henry's
oppreſſion, the commons choſe Dudley their ſpeaker, the very man who
was the chief inſtrument of his oppreſſions. And tho' the King was known
to be immenſely opulent, and had no pretence of wars or expenſive
enterprizes of any kind, they granted him the ſubſidy, which he demanded.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1505</label> But ſo inſatiable was his avarice, that
the next year he levied a new benevolence, and renewed that arbitrary and
oppreſſive method of taxation. By all theſe arts of accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, joined
to a rigid frugality in his expence, he ſo filled his coffers, that he is
ſaid to have poſſeſſed in ready money the ſum of 1,800,000 pounds:
An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible treaſure, if we conſider the ſcarcity of money in thoſe
days<note n="*" place="bottom">Silver was during this reign at 37 ſhillings and

of what they are at preſent: Theſe circumſtances make Henry's treaſure
appear very great; and may lead us to conceive the oppreſſions of his
government.</note>.</p>
               <p>BUT while Henry was enriching himſelf with the ſpoils of his
oppreſſed people, there happened an event abroad, which engaged his
attention, and was even the object of his anxiety and concern. Iſabella,
queen of Caſtile, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed about this
time; and it was foreſeen, that by this incident the fortunes of Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dand,
her huſband, would be much affected. The King was not only attentive to the
ſate of his ally, and watchful leſt the general ſyſtem of Europe
ſhould be affected by ſo important an event: He alſo conſidered the
ſimilarity of his own ſituation with that of Ferdinand, and regarded the
iſſue of theſe tranſactions as a precedent for himſelf. Joan, the
daughter of Ferdinand by Iſabella, was married to the archduke Philip, and
being, in right of her mother, heireſs of Caſtile, ſeemed entitled to
diſpute with Ferdinand the preſent adminiſtration of that kingdom. Henry
knew, that, notwithſtanding his own pretenſions by the houſe of
Lancaſter, the greateſt part of the nation were convinced of the
ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of his wife's title; and he dreaded leſt the prince, who was
daily advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards manhood, might be tempted by ambi ion to lay immediate
claim to <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0429000101:63"/> the throne. By his perpetual attention to
depreſs the partizans of the York family, he had more cloſely united them
into one party, and encreaſed their deſire of ſhaking off that yoke,
under which they had ſo long laboured, and of taking every advantage, which
his oppreſſive government would give his enemies againſt him. And as he
poſſeſſed no independent force like Ferdinand, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned a kingdom
more turbulent and unruly, which he himſelf, by his narrow politics, had
confirmed in factious prejudices; he apprehended that his ſituation would
prove in the iſſue ſtill more precarious.</p>
               <p>NOTHING could turn out more contrary to the King's inclination
than the tranſactions in Spain. Ferdinand had become very unpopular in
Caſtile, chiefly by reaſon of his former exactions and impoſitions; and
the ſtates of the kingdom diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered an evident reſolution of preferring
the title of Philip and Joan. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1506</label> In order to
take advantage of theſe favourable diſpoſitions, the archduke, now King

take ſhelter in the harbour of Weymouth. 
<note place="margin">A rival of the King of Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.</note> Sir
John Trenchard, a gentleman of authority in the county of Dorſet, hearing of

town. Finding, that Philip, in order to relieve his ſickneſs and fatigue,
was already come aſhore, he invited him to his houſe; and immediately
diſpatched an expreſs to inform the court of this important incident. The
King ſent in all haſte the earl of Arundel to congratulate the archduke on
his arrival in England, and to inform him, that he intended to pay him a
viſit in perſon, and give him a ſuitable reception in his kingdom. Philip
knew, that he could not now depart without the King's conſent; and therefore,
for the ſake of diſpatch, he reſolved to anticipate his viſit, and to
have an interview with him at Windſor. Henry received him with all the
magnificence poſſible, and with all the ſeeming cordiality; but he
reſolved, notwithſtanding, to extract ſome advantage from this
involuntary viſit, payed him by his royal gueſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Intrigues of the Earl of Suffolk.</note>
EDMOND de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, nephew to Edward the fourth, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the earl of Lincoln, ſlain at the battle of Stoke, had ſome years before
killed for a man in a ſudden fit of paſſion, and had been obliged to
apply to the King for a remiſſion of his crime. The King had granted his
requeſt; but being little indulgent to all perſons connected with the
houſe of York, he obliged him to appear openly in court and plead his pardon.
Suffolk more reſenting the affront, than grateful for the favour, had fled
into Flanders, and taken ſhelter with his aunt, the dutcheſs of Burgundy:
But being promiſed forgiveneſs by the King, he returned into England, and
obtained a new pardon. Actuated, however, by the <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0429000101:64"/> natural
inquietude of his temper, and uneaſy from debts which he had contracted by
his expences at prince Arthur's marriage, he again made an elopement into
Flanders. The King, well acquainted with the general diſcontent which
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt his adminiſtration, neglected not this incident, which
might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of importance; and he employed his uſual artifices to elude the
efforts of his enemies. He directed Sir Robert Curſon, governor of the
caſtle of Hammes, to fly from his charge, and to inſinuate himſelf into
the confidence of Suffolk, by making him a tender of his ſervices. Upon
information ſecretly conveyed by Curſon, the King ſeized William
Courtney, earl of Devonſhire, his brother in law, married to the lady
Catherine, daughter of Edward the fourth; Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam de la Pole, brother to the
earl of Suffolk; Sir James Tirrel, and Sir James Windham, with ſome perſons
of inferior quality; and he committed them all to cuſtody. The lord
Abergavenny and Sir Thomas Green were alſo appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; but were ſoon
after freed from their confinement. William de la Pole was retained in priſon
during a long time: And the earl of Devonſhire recovered not his freedom
during the King's life. But Henry's chief ſeverity fell upon Sir James
Windham, and Sir James Tirrel, who were both brought to their trial, condemned,
and executed: The fate of the latter gave univerſal ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, on
account of his participation in the murther of the young princes, ſons to
Edward the fourth. Notwithſtanding theſe diſcoveries and executions,
Curſon was ſtill able to maintain his credit with the earl of Suffolk; and
Henry, in order to remove all ſuſpicions, had ordered him to be
excommunicated, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Suffolk himſelf, for his pretended rebellion.
But after that traitor had performed all the ſervices expected from him, he
ſuddenly deſerted the earl, and came over to England, where the King
received him with unuſual marks of favour and confidence. Suffolk,
aſtoniſhed at this inſtance of perfidy, finding even that the dutcheſs
of Burgundy, tired with ſo many fruitleſs attempts, had become indifferent
to his cauſe, fled ſecretly into France, thence into Germany, and returned
at laſt into the Low Countries; where he was protected, tho' not
countenanced, by the archduke Philip, then in cloſe alliance with the
king.</p>
               <p>HENRY neglected not the preſent opportunity of compliaining to
Philip of the reception, which Suffolk had met with in his dominions. 
<q rend="inline">"I really thought," replied the King of
Caſtile, "that your greatneſs and felicity had ſet you far above
apprehenſions from any perſon of ſo little conſequence: But to give you
ſatisfaction, I ſhall baniſh him my ſtate."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"I expect, that you will carry your
complaiſance farther," ſaid the King: "I deſire to have Suffolk put into
my hands, where alone I can depend upon his ſubmiſſion and
obedience."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"That meaſure," ſaid Phillip, "will reflect
diſhonour upon you as well as <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0429000101:65"/> myſelf. You will be
thought to have uſed me as a priſoner."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Then the matter is at an end," replied the
King, "for I will take that diſhonour upon me; and ſo your honour is
ſaved<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon, p. 633.</note>."</q> The king of
Caſtile found himſelf under a neceſſity of complying; but he firſt
exacted Henry's promiſe that he would ſpare Suffolk's life. That nobleman
was invited over to England by Philip; as if the King would grant him a pardon,
by the interceſſion of his friend and ally. Upon his appearance, he was
committed to the Tower; and the King of Caſtile, having fully ſatisfied
Henry, as well by this conceſſion, as by ſigning a treaty of commerce
between England and Caſtile, which was advantageous to the former
kingdom<note n="†" place="bottom">Rymer, vol. 13. p. 14<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

himſelf in his authority, and to govern, till the day of his death, the whole
Spaniſh monarchy.</p>
               <p>THE King ſurvived theſe tranſactions two years; but little
memorable occurs in the remaining part of his reign, except his affiancing his

<note place="margin">Sickneſs of the King.</note> But the decline
of his health put an end to all ſuch thoughts; and he began to caſt his eye
towards that future exiſtence, which the iniquities and ſeverities of his
reign rendered a very diſmal proſpect to him. To allay the terrors, under
which he laboured, he endeavoured, by diſtributing of alms and founding of
religious houſes, to make attonement for his crimes, and to purchaſe, with
the ſacrifice of part of his ill-gotten treaſures, a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement to his
offended Maker. Remorſe even ſeized him by intervals for the abuſes of
his authority by Empſon and Dudley; but not ſufficient to make him ſtop
the repacious hand of thoſe oppreſſors. Sir William Capel was again fined
two thouſand pounds under ſome frivolous pretences, and was committed to
the Tower for daring to murmur againſt that iniquity. Harris, an alderman of
London, was indicted, and died of vexation before his trial came to an
iſſue. Sir Lawrence Ailmer, who had been mayor, and his two ſheriffs,
were condemned in heavy fines, and ſent to priſon till they made payment.
The King gave coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to all theſe oppreſſions; till death, by its

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">And character</note> THE reign of Henry the
ſeventh was, in the main, fortunate for his people at home, and honourable
abroad. He put an end to the civil wars with which the nation had been long
harraſſed, he maintained peace and order in the ſtate, he depreſſed
the former exorbitant power of the nobility, and, together with the
friendſhip of ſome foreign princes, he acquired the conſideration and
regard of all. He loved peace without fearing war; tho' agitated with continual
ſuſpicions of his ſervants and miniſters, he diſcovered no timidity
either in the conduct of his affairs, or in the day of battle; and tho' often
ſevere in his puniſhments, he was commonly leſs actuated by revenge than
by the maxims of policy. The ſervices, which he rendered the people, were
derived from his views of private intereſt, rather than the motives of public
ſpirit; and where he deviated from ſelfiſh regards, it was unknown to
himſelf, and ever from the malignant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of faction or the mean
projects of avarice; not from the ſallies of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or allurements of
pleaſure; ſtill leſs, from the benign motives of friendſhip and
generoſity. His capacity was excellent, but ſomewhat contracted, by the
narrowneſs of his heart; he poſſeſſed inſinuation and addreſs,
but never em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed theſe talents, except where ſome great point of
intereſt was to be gained; and while he neglected to conciliate the
affections of his people, he often felt the danger of reſting his authority
on their fear and reverence alone. He was always extremely attentive to his
affairs, but poſſeſſed not the faculty of ſeeing far into futurity;
and was more expert at providing a remedy for his miſtakes than judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in
avoiding them. Avarice was on the whole his ruling paſſion<note n="*" place="bottom">As a proof of Henry's attention to the ſmalleſt profits,
Bacon tells us, that he had ſeen a book of Accompts kept by Empſon, and
ſubſcribed in almoſt every leaf by the King's own hand. Among other
articles was the following. 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Item,</hi> Received of ſuch a one five
marks for a pardon, which, if it do not paſs, the money to be repayed, or the

had wrote with his own hand, 
<q rend="inline">"otherwiſe ſatisfied."</q> Bacon, p.
630.</note>; and he remains an inſtance, almoſt ſingular, of a man,
placed in a high ſtation, and poſſeſſed of talents for great affairs,
in whom that paſſion predominated above ambition. Even among private
perſons, avarice is commonly nothing but a ſpecies of ambition, and is
chiefly incited by the proſpect of that regard, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction and
conſideration which are derived from riches.</p>
               <p>THE power of the Kings of England had always been ſomewhat
irregular or diſcretionary; but was ſcarce ever ſo abſolute during any
reign as during that of <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0429000101:67"/> Henry. Beſides the perſonal
character of the man, full of vigour, induſtry, and ſeverity, deliberate in
all projects, ſteady in every purpoſe, and attended with caution, as well
as good fortune, in each enterprize; became to the throne after long and bloody
civil wars, which had deſtroyed all the great nobility, who alone could
reſiſt the encroachments of his authority: The nation was tired with
diſcord and inteſtine convulſions, and willing to ſubmit to
uſurpations, and even injuries, rather than plunge themſelves anew into
like miſeries: The fruitleſs efforts made againſt him ſerved always, as
is uſual, to confirm his authority: As he ruled by a faction, and the
leſſer faction, all thoſe on whom he conferred offices, ſenſible that
they owed every thing to his protection, were content to ſupport his power,
tho' at the expence of juſtice and national privileges: Theſe ſeem the
chief cauſes which at this time beſtowed on the crown ſo conſiderable
an addition of prerogative, and rendered the preſent reign a kind of epoch in
the Engliſh conſtitution.</p>
               <p>THIS prince, tho' he exalted his own prerogative above law, is
celebrated by his hiſtorian for many good laws, which he cauſed to be
enacted for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſubjects. Several conſiderable
regulations, indeed, are found among the ſtatutes of this reign, both with
regard to the police of the kingdom, and its commerce: But the former are
commonly contrived with much better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the latter. 
<note place="margin">His laws.</note> The more ſimple ideas of
order and equity are ſufficient to guide a legiſlator in every thing that
regards the internal adminiſtration of juſtice: But the principles of
commerce are much more complicated, and require long experience and deep
reflection to be well underſtood in any ſtate. The real conſequence of a
law or practice is there often contrary to firſt appearances. No wonder, that
during the reign of Henry the ſeventh, theſe matters were often
miſunderſtood; and it may ſafely be affirmed, that even in the age of
lord Bacon, very imperfect and erroneous ideas were formed on that
ſubject.</p>
               <p>EARLY in Henry's reign, the authority of the Star Chamber, which
was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore founded on common law and very ancient practice, was in ſome
caſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by act of Parliament<note n="*" place="bottom">Rot. Parl. 3.
H. 7. n. 17.</note>: Lord Bacon extols the uſe of this court; but men began,
during the age of that hiſtorian, to feel that ſo arbitrary a

ſpirit of independance roſe ſtill higher in the nation, the averſion
againſt it increaſed, till it was entirely aboliſhed by act of Parliament
in the reign of Charles the firſt, a little before the commencement of the

till <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0429000101:68"/> after that term; and as the friends of the perſon

crime was apt to paſs unpuniſhed. Suits were given to the poor <hi>in forma

abridged<note n="§" place="bottom">4 H 7. cap. 13.</note>, and the criminal,

marking his crime; after which, he was puniſhed capitally for every new
offence. This law was much too indulgent, yet was in thoſe days regarded as a
violation of the rights of the church. Sheriffs were no longer allowed to fine
any perſon, without previouſly ſummoning him before their court<note n="‖" place="bottom">11 H. 7. cap. 15.</note>. It is ſtrange, that

ſome great lord, and were kept in readineſs to aſſiſt him in all

in courts of juſtice<note n="§§" place="bottom">3 H. 7. cap. 12. 11
H. 7. cap. 25.</note>. This diſorder, which had ariſen during turbulent
times, when the law could give little protection to the ſubject, was then
deeply rooted in England; and it required all the vigilance and rigour of Henry
to extirpate it. There is a ſtory of his ſeverity againſt that abuſe;
which ſeems to merit praiſe, tho' it is commonly cited as an inſtance of
his avarice and rapacity. The earl of Oxford, his favourite general, to whom he
always gave great and deſerved truſt, having ſplendidly entertained him
at his caſtle of Heningham, was deſirous of making a ſhow of his
magnificence at the departure of his royal gueſt; and ordered all his
retainers, with their liveries and badges, to be drawn up in two lines, that
their appearance might be more ga lant and ſplendid. 
<q rend="inline">"My lord," ſaid the King, "I have heard much
of your hoſpitality; but the truth far exceeds the report. Theſe handſome
gentlemen <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0429000101:69"/> and yeomen, whom I ſee on both ſides of me,
are ſurely your menial ſervants."</q> The earl ſmiled, and confeſſed
that his fortune was too narrow for ſuch magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. 
<q rend="inline">"They are moſt of them," ſubjoined he, "my
retainers, who are come to do me ſervice at ſuch a time, when they knew I
was honoured with your majeſty's preſence."</q> The King ſtarted a
little, and ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"By my faith, my lord, I thank you for my good
cheer, but I muſt not allow my laws to be broken in my ſight. My attorney
muſt ſpeak with you."</q> Oxford is ſaid to have payed no leſs than
fifteen thouſand marks, as a compoſition for his offence.</p>
               <p>THE encreaſe of the arts, more effectually than all the
ſeverities of laws, put an end to this pernicious practice. The nobility,
inſtead of vying with each other, in the number and boldneſs of their
retainers, acquired a more civilized ſpecies of emulation, and endeavoured to
excell in the ſplendour and elegance of their equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, houſes, and
tables. The common people, no longer maintained in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious idleneſs by
their ſuperiors, were obliged to learn ſome calling or induſtry, and
became uſeful both to themſelves and others. And it muſt be acknowledged,
in ſpite of thoſe who declaim ſo violently againſt the refinement of
the art, or what they are pleaſed to call luxury, that, as much as an
induſtrious tradeſman is both a better man and a better citizen that one of
thoſe idle retainers, who fo merly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the great families; as much
is the life of a modern nobleman more lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable than that of an antient
baron.</p>
               <p>BUT the moſt important law in its conſequences, which was
enacted during the reign of Henry, was that by which the nobility and gentry
acquired a power of breaking the antient entails, and of alienating their
eſtates<note n="†" place="bottom">4 H. 7. cap. 24.</note>. By means of
this law, joined to the beginning luxury and refinements of the age, the great
fortunes of the barons were gradually diſſipated, and the property of the
commons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in England. It is probable, that Henry foreſaw and
intended this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; becauſe the conſtant ſcheme of his policy
conſiſted in depreſſing the great, and exalting churchmen, lawyers, and
men of new families, who were more dependant on him.</p>
               <p>THIS King's love of money naturally led him to encourage
commerce, which encreaſed his cuſtoms; but, if we may judge by moſt of
the laws enacted during his reign, trade and induſtry were rather hurt than
promoted by the care and attention which were given to them. Severe laws were
made againſt taking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt for money, which was then denominated
uſury<note n="‡" place="bottom">3 H. 7. cap. 5.</note>. Even the profits
of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change were prohibited, as ſavouring of uſury<note n="§" place="bottom">3 H. 7. cap. 6.</note>, which the ſuperſtition of that age
zealouſly proſcribed. All evaſive contracts, by which profits could be
made from the loan of money, were alſo carefully guarded againſt<note n="‖" place="bottom">7. H. 7. cap. 8.</note>. It is needleſs to
obſerve how unreaſonable and iniquitous theſe laws, how impoſſible to
be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and how hurtful to trade, if they could take place. We may
obſerve, <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0429000101:70"/> however, to the praiſe of this King, that
ſometimes, in order to promote com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, he lent to merchants ſums of
money, without intereſt; when he knew, that their ſtock was not
ſufficient for thoſe enterprizes, which they propoſed to undertake<note n="*" place="bottom">Polyd. Virg.</note>.</p>
               <p>LAWS were made againſt the exportation of money, plate, or
bullion<note n="†" place="bottom">4 H. 7. cap. 23.</note>: A precaution,
which ſerves no other purpoſe than to make more be exported. But ſo far
was the anxiety on this head carried, that merchant aliens, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
commodities into the kingdom, were obliged to inveſt, in Engliſh
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, all the money acquired by their ſales, in order to prevent
their convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the money in a clandeſtine manner<note n="‡" place="bottom">3 H. 7. cap. 8.</note>.</p>
               <p>HORSES were forbid to be exported; as if that exportation did
not encourage the breed, and render them more plentiful<note n="§" place="bottom">11 H. 7. cap. 13.</note>. To promote archery, no bows were to be
ſold at a higher price that ſix ſhillings and four pence<note n="‖" place="bottom">3 H. 7. cap. 12.</note>, reducing money to the
denomination of our time. The only effect of this regulation muſt be either
that the people would be ſupplied with bad bows or none at all. Prices were
alſo affixed to woollen cloath<note n="**" place="bottom">4 H. 7. cap.
8.</note>, to caps and hats<note n="††" place="bottom">4 H. 7. cap.
9.</note>: And labourers wages were regulated by law<note n="‡‡" place="bottom">11 H. 7. cap. 22.</note>. It is evident, that theſe
circumſtances ought always to be left free, and muſt be truſted to the
common courſe of buſineſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. To ſome it may appear
ſurprizing, that the price of a yard of ſcarlet cloth ſhould be limited
to ſix and twenty ſhillings, that of a yard of coloured cloth to eighteen;
higher prices than theſe commodities bear at preſent: And that the wages of
a tradeſman, ſuch as a maſon, bricklayer, tyler, &amp;c. ſhould be
regulated at near ten pence a day; which is not much inferior to the preſent
wages given in ſome places of England. There is a vulgar error in imagining,
that the price of labour and commodities has in general riſen extremely
ſince the diſcovery of the Weſt-Indies. The greater induſtry of the
preſent times has encreaſed the number of tradeſmen and labourers, ſo
as to keep wages nearer a par than could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the great encreaſe
of gold and ſilver. And the additional art em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the finer
manufactures, has even made ſome of theſe commodities fall below their
former value. Not to mention, that merchants and dealers, being contented with
leſs profit than formerly, afford the goods cheaper to their cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. It
appears by a ſtatute of this reign<note n="§§" place="bottom">4 H. 7.
cap. 9.</note>. that goods bought for ſixteen pence would ſometimes be
ſold by the merchants for three ſhillings. The commodities, whoſe price
has chiefly riſen, are butcher-meat, fowl, and fiſh, (eſpecially the
latter) which cannot be much augmented in quantity by the encreaſe of art and
induſtry. The profeſſion which then abounded moſt, and was embraced by
perſons of the loweſt rank, was the church: By a clauſe of a ſtatute,
all clerks or ſtudents of the univerſity were forbid to beg, without a
permiſſion from the vice-chancellor<note n="‖‖" place="bottom">11 H. 7. cap. 22.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0429000101:71"/> ONE great cauſe of the low ſtate of
induſtry during this period, was the ridiculous reſtraints put upon it; and
the parliament, or rather the King, (for he was the prime mover in every thing)
enlarged a little ſome of theſe limitations; but not to the degree that was
requiſite. A ridiculous law had been enacted during the reign of Henry the
fourth<note n="*" place="bottom">7 H. 7. cap. 17.</note>, that no man could bind
his ſon or daughter to an apprenticeſhip, unleſs he was poſſeſſed
of twenty ſhillings a year in land; and Henry the ſeventh, becauſe the
decay of manufactures was complained of in Norwich from the want of hands,
exempted that city from the penalties of this law<note n="†" place="bottom">11 H. 7. cap. 11.</note>. Afterwards, the whole county of Norfolk
obtained a like exemption with regard to ſome branches of the woollen
manufacture<note n="‡" place="bottom">12 H. 7. cap 1.</note>. Theſe
abſurd limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions proceeded from a deſire of promoting huſbandry, which
however is never more effectually encouraged than by the encreaſe of
manufactures. For a like reaſon, the law enacted againſt incloſures, and
for the keeping up farm houſes<note n="§" place="bottom">4 H. 7. cap.
19.</note>, ſcarce deſerves the high praiſes beſtowed on it by lord
Bacon. If huſbandmen underſtand agriculture, and have a ready vent for
their commodities, we need never dread a diminution of the people, employed in
the country. All me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of ſupporting populouſneſs, except by the
intereſt of the proprietors, are violent and ineffectual. During a century
and a half after this period, there was a continual renewal of laws and edicts
againſt depopulation; whence we may infer, that none of them were ever
executed. The natural courſe of improvement at laſt provided a remedy.</p>
               <p>ONE great check to induſtry in England was the erecting
corporations; an abuſe which is not yet entirely corrected. A law was
enacted, that corporations ſhould not paſs any by-laws without the
conſent of three of the chief officers of ſtate<note n="‖" place="bottom">19 H. 7. cap. 7.</note>. They were prohibited to impoſe tolls at
their gates<note n="**" place="bottom">19 H. 7. cap. 8.</note>. The cities of
Gloceſter and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter had even impoſed tolls on the Severne, which
were aboliſhed<note n="††" place="bottom">19 H. 7. cap.
18.</note>.</p>
               <p>THERE is a law of this reign<note n="‡‡" place="bottom">12 H. 7. cap. 6.</note>, containing a preamble, from which it
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the company of merchant adventurers in London, had, by their own
proper authority, debarred all the other merchants of the kingdom, from trading
to the great marts in the low countries, unleſs each trader previouſly
payed them the ſum of near ſeventy pounds. It is ſurpriſing that ſuch
a by-law (if it deſerves that name) could ever be carried into execution, and
that the authority of Parliament ſhould be requiſite to abrogate it.</p>
               <p>IT was during this reign, on the ſecond of Auguſt 1492, a
little before ſun ſet, that Chriſtopher Columbus, a Florentine, ſet out
from Cadiz on his memorable voyage for the diſcovery of the weſtern world;
and a few years after, Vaſquez de <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0429000101:72"/> Gama, a Portugueſe,
paſſed the cape of Good Hope, and opened a new paſſage to the Eaſt
Indies. Theſe great events were attended with the moſt important
conſequences to all the nations of Europe, even to ſuch as were not
immediately concerned in thoſe naval enterprizes. The enlargement of commerce
and naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion encr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſed
induſtry and the arts every where: The nobles diſſipated their fortunes
in expenſive pleaſures: Men of an inferior rank both acquired a ſhare in
the landed property, and created to themſelves a conſiderable property of a
new kind, in ſtock, commodities, art, credit, and correſpondence. In ſome
nations the privileges of the commons encreaſed, by this encreaſe of
property: In moſt nations, the Kings, finding arms to be dropt by the barons,
who could no longer endure their former rude manner of life, eſtabliſhed
ſtanding armies, and ſubdued the liberties of the kingdom: But in all
places, the condition of the people, from the depreſſion of the petty
tyrants, by whom they had formerly been oppreſſed, rather than governed,
received great improvement, and they acquired, if not entire liberty, at
leaſt the moſt conſiderable advantages of it. And as the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
courſe of events thus tended to depreſs the nobles and exalt the people,
Henry the ſeventh, who alſo embraced that ſyſtem of policy, has
acquired more praiſe, than his inſtitutions, ſtrictly ſpeaking, ſeem
of themſelves to deſerve, on account of any profound wiſdom attending
them.</p>
               <p>IT was by accident only, that the King had not a conſiderable
hand in thoſe great naval diſcoveries, by which the preſent age was ſo
much diſtinguiſhed. Columbus, after meeting many repulſes from the courts
of Portugal and Spain, ſent his brother Bartholomew into England, in order to
explain his projects to Henry, and crave his protection for the execution of
them. Henry invited him to England; but his brother, in returning to Spain,
being taken by pyrates, was detained in his voyage; and Columbus, mean-while,
having obtained the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Iſabella, was equipped with a ſmall
fleet, and happily executed his enterprize. Henry was not diſcouraged with
this diſappointment: He fitted out Sebaſtian Cabot, a Venetian, dwelling in
Briſtol; and ſent him weſtwards in 1498 in ſearch of new countries.
Cabot diſcovered the main land of America towards the ſixtieth degree of
northern latitude: He ſailed ſouthwards along the coaſt, and diſcovered
Newfoundland, and other countries: But returned to England without making any
conqueſt or ſettlement. Elliot and other merchants in Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol made a
like attempt in 1502<note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer, vol. XIII. p. 37.</note>.
The King expended fourteen thouſand pounds in building one ſhip called the
<hi>Great Harry</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Stowe, p. 484.</note>. This
was properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt ſhip in the Engliſh navy. Before this
period, when the prince wanted a fleet, he had no other expedient but the
hiring ſhips from the merchants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0429000101:73"/> BUT though this improvement of navigation,
and the diſcovery of both the Indies, was the moſt memorable incident that
happened during this or any other period, it was not the only great event by
which the age was diſtinguiſhed. In 1453 Conſtantinople was taken by the
Turks; and the Greeks, among whom ſome remains of learning were ſtill
preſerved, being ſcattered by theſe Barbarians, took ſhelter in Italy,
and imported, together with their admirable language, a tincture of their
ſcience and their refined taſte in poetry and eloquence. About the ſame
time, the purity of the Latin tongue was revived, the ſtudy of antiquity
became faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and the eſteem for literature gradually propagated
itſelf through every nation of Europe. The art of printing, invented about
that time, facilitated extremely the progreſs of all theſe improvements:
The invention of gunpowder changed the whole art of war: Mighty innovations
were ſoon after made in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſuch as not only affected thoſe
ſtates that embraced them, but even thoſe that adhered to the antient faith
and worſhip: And thus a general revolution was made in human affairs
throughout this part of the world; and men attained that ſituation with
regard to commerce, arts, ſciences, government, police, and cultivation, in
which they have ever ſince perſevered. Here therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences the
uſeful, as well as agreeable part of modern annals; certainty has place in
all the conſiderable, and even moſt of the minute parts of hiſtorical
narration; a great variety of events, preſerved by printing, give the author
the power of ſelecting, as well as adorning, the facts, which he relates; and
as each incident has a reference to our preſent manners and ſituation,
inſtructive leſſons occur every moment during the courſe of the
narration. Whoever carries his anxious reſearches into preceding periods is
moved by a curioſity, liberal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and commendable; not by any
neceſſity for acquiring a knowledge of public affairs, or the arts of civil
government.</p>

               <p>THE death of Henry the ſeventh had been attended with as open
and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible a joy as decency would permit; 
<note place="margin">Popularity of the new King.</note> and the
acceſſion and coronation of his ſon, Henry the eighth, ſpread
univerſally a declared and unfeigned ſatisfaction. Inſtead of a monarch,
jealous, ſevere, and avaritious, who, in proportion as he advanced in years,
was ſinking ſtill deeper in thoſe unpopular vices; a young prince of
eighteen had ſucceeded to the throne, who, even in the eyes of men of
ſenſe, gave very promiſing hopes of his future conduct, much 
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0429000101:75"/> more in thoſe of the people, always enchanted with
novelty, youth, and royal dignity. The beauty and vigour of his perſon,
accompanied with dexterity in every manly exerciſe, was farther adorned with
a blooming and ruddy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, with a lively air, with the appearance of
ſpirit and activity in all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour<note n="*" place="bottom">T. Mori,
Lucubr. p. 182.</note>. His father, in order to remove him from the knowledge
of public buſineſs, had hitherto occupied him entirely in the ſtudy of
literature; and the proficiency, which he made, gave no bad prognoſtic of his
parts and capacity<note n="†" place="bottom">Father Paul, lib. 1.</note>.
Even the vices of vehemence, ardour, and impatience, to which he was ſubject,
and which afterwards degenerated into tyranny, were interpreted only as faults,
incident to unguarded youth, which would be corrected, when time had brought
him to greater moderation and maturity. And as the contending titles of York
and Lancaſter were now at laſt fully united in his perſon, men juſtly
expected from a prince, obnoxious to no party, that impartiality of
adminiſtration, which had ſo long been unknown in England.</p>
               <p>THE favourable prepoſſeſſions of the public were
encouraged by the meaſures, which Henry embraced in the commencement of his
reign. His grandmother, the counteſs of Richmond and Derby, was ſtill
alive; and as ſhe was a woman much celebrated for prudence and virtue, he
very wiſely ſhewed great deference to her opinion in the eſtabliſhment
of his new council. 
<note place="margin">His miniſters.</note> The members were,
Warham, archbiſhop of Canterbury, and chancellor; the earl of Shrewſbury,
ſteward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lord Herbert, chamberlain; Sir Thomas Lovel, maſter of the
wards and conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Tower; Sir Edward Poynings, knight of the garter,
comptroller; Sir Henry Marney, afterwards lord Marney; Sir Thomas Darcy,
afterwards lord Darcy; Thomas Ruthal, doctor of laws; and Sir Henry Wyat<note n="‡" place="bottom">Herbert, Stow, p. 486. Holling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, p. 799.</note>. Theſe men
had been long accuſtomed to affairs under the late King, and were the leaſt
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popular of all the miniſters employed by that monarch.</p>
               <p>BUT the chief competitors for favour and authority under the new
King were the earl of Surrey, treaſurer, and Fox, biſhop of Wincheſter,
ſecretary and privy ſeal. This prelate, who had enjoyed great credit during
all the former reign, had acquired ſuch habits of caution and frugality as he
could not eaſily lay aſide; and he ſtill oppoſed, by his
remonſtrances, thoſe ſchemes of diſſipation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, which the
youth and paſſions of Henry rendered agreeable to him. But Surrey was a
more dextrous courtier; and tho' few had borne a greater ſhare in the frugal
politics of the laſt King, he knew how to conform himſelf to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of his new maſter; and no one was ſo forward in promoting that libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
pleaſure, and magnificence, which began to prevail under the young
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch<note n="§" place="bottom">Lord Herbert.</note>. By this policy he
ingratiated himſelf with Henry; he made profit, as <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0429000101:76"/> well
as the other courtiers, of the laviſh diſpoſition of his maſter; and he
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged him in ſuch a courſe of play and idleneſs as rendered him
negligent of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and willing to entruſt the government of the ſtate
entirely into the hands of his miniſters. The immenſe treaſures,
amaſſed by the late King, were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually diſſipated in the giddy
expences of Henry. One party of pleaſure ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded another: Tilts,
tournaments and carouſels were exhibited with all the magnificence of that
age: And as the preſent tranquillity of the public permitted the court to
indulge itſelf in every amuſement, ſerious buſineſs was but little
attended to. Or if the King intermitted the courſe of his feſtivity, he
employed himſelf chiefly in an application to muſic and literature, which
were his favourite purſuits, and which were well adapted to his genius. He
had made ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in the former art, as even to compoſe ſome
pieces of church muſic which were ſung in his chapel<note n="†" place="bottom">Lord Herbert.</note>. He was initiated in the elegant learning of
the antients. And tho' he was ſo unfortunate as to be ſeduced into a
ſtudy of the barren controverſies of the ſchools, which were then
faſhionable, and had choſen Thomas Aquinas for his favourite author, he
ſtill diſcovered a capacity fitted for more uſeful and entertaining
knowledge.</p>
               <p>THE frank and careleſs humour of the King, as it led him to
diſſipate the treaſures, amaſſed by his father, rendered him
negligent in protecting the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whom that prince had employed in
his extortions. A proclamation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iſſued to encourage complaints, the
rage of the people was let looſe on all the delators and informers, who had

Empſon and Dudley, who were moſt expoſed to public hatred, were
immediately cited before the council, in order to anſwer for their conduct,
which had rendered them ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious. Empſon made a ſhrewd apology for
himſelf, as well as for his aſſociate. He told the council, that ſo far
from his being juſtly expoſed to cenſure for his paſt conduct, his
enemies themſelves grounded their clamour on actions, which ſeemed rather
to merit reward and approbation: That a ſtrict execution of law was the
crime, of which he and Dudley were accuſed; tho' that law had been
eſtabliſhed by the voluntary conſent of the people, and tho' they had
acted in obedience to the King, to whom the adminiſtration of juſtice was
entruſted by the conſtitution: That it belonged not to them, who were
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in the hands of the ſupreme power, to determine what laws were
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent or obſolete, expedient or hurtful; ſince they were all alike valid,
ſo long <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0429000101:77"/> as they remained unrepealed by the
legiſlature: That it was natural for a licentious populace to murmur
againſt the reſtraints of authority; but all wiſe ſtates had ever made
their glory to conſiſt in the juſt diſtribution of reward and
puniſhment, and had annexed the former to the obſervance and enforcement of
the laws, the latter to their violation and infraction: And that a ſudden
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of all government might be expected; where the judges were committed
to the mercy of the criminals, the rulers to that of the ſubjects<note n="†" place="bottom">Herbert, Hollingſhed, p. 804.</note>.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING this defence, Empſon and Dudley were ſent to
the Tower; and ſoon after brought to their trial. The ſtrict execution of
laws, however obſolete, could never be imputed to them as a crime in a court
of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature; and it is likely, that even where they had exerciſed
arbitrary power, the King, as they had acted by the ſecret commands of his
father, was not willing to have their conduct expoſed to too ſevere a
ſcrutiny. In order, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to gratify the people with the puniſhment
of theſe obnoxious miniſters, crimes very improbable, or indeed
abſolutely impoſſible, were charged upon them, that they had entered into
a conſpiracy againſt the King, and had intended, on the death of the late
King, to have ſeized by force the adminiſtration of the government. The
jury were ſo far moved by popular prejudices, joined to court influence, as
to give ſentence againſt them; which was afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by a bill of
attainder in Parliament<note n="*" place="bottom">This Parliament met on the
21ſt January, 1510. A law was there enacted, in order to prevent ſome
abuſes which had prevailed during the late reign. The forfeiture upon the
penal ſtatutes was reduced to the term of three years. Coſts and damages
were given againſt informers upon acquital of the accuſed: More ſevere
puniſhments were enacted againſt perjury: the falſe inquiſitions

puniſhed the inſtruments of paſt tyranny, had yet ſuch deference to
former engagements as to deliberate, immediately after his acceſſion,
concerning the conſummation of his marriage with the infanta Catherine, to
whom he was affianced during his father's lifetime. Her former marriage with
his brother, and the inequality of their years, were the chief objections,
which were urged againſt the eſpouſing her: But on the other hand, the
advantages of her known virtue, modeſty, and ſweetneſs of diſpoſition
were inſiſted on; the affection which ſhe bore the King; the large dowry
to which ſhe was entitled as princeſs of Wales; the intereſt of cementing
a cloſe alliance with Spain; the <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0429000101:78"/> neceſſity of

which rendered his domeſtic adminiſtration eaſy and proſperous: 
<note place="margin">Foreign af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</note> The ſituation of
foreign affairs was no leſs happy and deſirable. Italy continued ſtill,
as during the late reign, to be the center of all the wars and negotiations of
the European princes; and Henry's alliance was courted by both ſides; at the
ſame time, that he was not engaged by any immediate intereſt or
neceſſity to take part with either. Lewis the twelfth of France, after the
conqueſt of Milan, was the only great prince who poſſeſſed any
territory in Italy; and could he have remained in tranquillity, he was enabled
by his ſituation to preſcribe laws to all the Italian princes and
republics, and to hold the ballance among them. But the deſire of making a
conqueſt of Naples, to which he had the ſame title or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion with
his predeceſſor, ſtill engaged him in new enterprizes; and as he
foreſaw oppoſition from Ferdinand, who was connected both by treaties and
affinity with Frederic of Naples, he endeavoured, by the offers of intereſt,
to which the ears of that monarch were ever open, to engage him in an
oppoſite confederacy. He ſettled with him a plan for the partition of the
Kingdom of Naples and the expulſion of Frederic: A plan, which the
politicians of that age regarded as the moſt egregious imprudence in the
French monarch, and the baſeſt treachery in the Spaniſh. Frederic,
ſupported only by ſubjects, who were either diſcontented with his
government, or indifferent about his fortunes, was unable to reſiſt ſo
powerful a confederacy, and was deprived of his dominions: But he had the
ſatisfaction to ſee Naples immediately prove the ſource of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
among his enemies. Ferdinand gave ſecret orders to his general, Gonſalvo,
whom the Spaniards honour with the appellation of the <hi>great captain,</hi>
to attack the armies of France, and make himſelf maſter of all the
dominions of Naples. Gonſalvo prevailed in every enterprize, defeated the
French in two pitched battles, and enſured to his prince the entire
poſſeſſion of that fine kingdom. Lewis, unable to procure redreſs by
force of arms, was obliged to enter into a fruitleſs negotiation with
Ferdinand for the recovery of his ſhare of the partition; <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0429000101:79"/> and all Italy, during ſome time, was held in ſuſpence between
theſe two power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful monarchs.</p>
               <p>THERE ſcarce has been any period, when the ballance of power
was better ſecured in Europe, and ſeemed more able to maintain itſelf,
without any anxious concern or attention of the princes. Several great
monarchies were eſtabliſhed; and no one ſo far ſurpaſſed the reſt
as to give any foundation, or even pretence, for jealouſy. England was united
in domeſtic peace, and by its ſituation happily ſecured from the
invaſion of foreigners. The coalition of the ſeveral kingdoms of Spain, had
formed one powerful monarchy, which Ferdinand adminiſtered with arts,
fraudulent indeed and deceitful, but full of vigour and ability. Lewis the
twelfth of France, a gallant and generous prince, by eſpouſing Anne of
Britanny, widow to his predeceſſor, had preſerved the union with that
princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, on which the ſafety of his kingdom ſo much depended.
Maximilian, the emperor, beſides the hereditary dominions of the Auſtrian
family, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained authority in the empire, and notwithſtanding his levity
of diſpoſition, was able to unite the German princes in any great plan of
intereſt, at leaſt, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Charles, prince of Caſtile, grandſon
to Maximilian and Ferdinand, had already ſucceeded to the rich dominions of
the houſe of Burgundy; and being as yet in early youth, the government was
entruſted to Margaret of Savoy, his aunt, a princeſs endowed with ſignal
prudence and virtue. The internal force of theſe ſeveral powerful ſtates,
which ballanced each other, might long have maintained general tranquillity,
had not the active and enterprizing genius of an ambitious pontiff firſt
excited the flames of war and diſcord among them.</p>

diſpleaſure a republic nearly on a level with themſelves, it was eaſy

had voluntarily, for money, conſigned into their hand: Lewis propoſed to
recover a part of the territory of Milan, which he himſelf had delivered to

Louis XII. St. Gelais, Guicciard. lib. 8.</note>. Diſmayed with this loſs,
the Venetians took a haſty reſolution of abandoning all their dominions on
the continent of Italy; and they accordingly withdrew their garriſons from
every place, and freed their ſubjects from their oaths of allegiance. Lewis
immediately put himſelf in poſſeſſion of Cremona, Bergamo, Breſcia,
Creme, and all the places which had been diſmembered from the Milaneſe.
Even Verona, Padua, Vicenza, and other towns, which, by the treaty of Cambray,
fell under the partition of Maximilian, offered to open their gates to the
French monarch. Had Maximilian, inſtead of waſting his time at Trent, led
his forces early into Italy, an end had been put for ever to the power and
dominion of Venice. But Lewis, well acquainted with the fickleneſs and
inconſtancy of that prince, was determined to give him no pretext for
deſerting his alliance; and therefore ordered the magiſtrates of thoſe
towns to make their ſubmiſſions to the emperor, whom, he told them, they
were now to regard as their lawful ſovereign<note n="†" place="bottom">Buonacorſi, Pettus de Angleria, epiſt. 418.</note>. The

regret, which their ſubjects diſcovered on loſing their mild and
equitable government<note n="‡" place="bottom">Guicciard. lib. 8.</note>,
began again to aſſume courage, and reinſtated themſelves in the
dominion of thoſe cities, which they had abandoned. From this time, their
prudence and ſound policy gave a cheque to the malignity of their fortune and
the ſuperiority of their enemies. They voluntarily made a ſacrifice to
Ferdinand of thoſe towns, which he laid claim to, and thereby detached him
from the alliance<note n="§" place="bottom">Petrus de Angleria.</note>. They
gratified the ambition of the Pope by a like ſacrifice; and farther flattered

like arts with Maximilian, and finding his pretenſions to be utterly

reſiſtance, with a courage, which, tho' ill ſeconded by the unwarlike
genius of their people, might have done honour to the Roman ſenate during the
moſt flouriſhing period of the republic.</p>
               <p>THE great force and ſecure ſituation of the conſiderable
monarchies, prevented any one of them from aſpiring to any conqueſt of
moment; and tho' this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration could not maintain general peace, or
remedy the natural inquietude of men, it rendered the princes of this age more
eaſy in deſerting engagements and changing their alliances, in which they
were retained more by humour and caprice than by any natural or durable
intereſt. Julius had no ſooner humbled the Venetian republic, than he was
inſpired with a nobler ambition, that of <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0429000101:82"/> expelling all
foreigners from Italy, or, to ſpeak in the ſtile affected by the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
of that age, the freeing that country entirely from the dominion of the
Barbarians<note n="*" place="bottom">Guicciard. lib. 8.</note>. He was determined
to make the tempeſt fall firſt upon Lewis; and in order to pave the way for
this great enterprize, he at once ſought for a ground of quarrel with that
monarch, and courted the alliance of other princes. He declared war againſt
the Duke of Ferrara, the cloſeſt confederate of Lewis. He ſollicited the
favour of England, by ſending Henry a ſacred roſe, perfumed with muſk
and anointed with chriſm<note n="†" place="bottom">Spelman, Concil. vol.

and Henry's ambaſſador at Rome, whom he ſoon after created cardinal. He
drew over Ferdinand to his ſide, tho' that monarch, at firſt, made no
declaration of his intentions. And what he chiefly valued, he framed a treaty
with the Swiſs cantons, who, enraged by ſome neglects put upon them by
Lewis, accompanied with contumelious expreſſions, had deſerted the
alliance of France, and waited an opportunity of revenging themſelves on that
nation.</p>
               <p>LEWIS was determined not to abandon the duke of Ferrara, who
ſuffered merely for his attachment to the crown of France. Chaumont, his
lieutenant in the Milaneſe, received orders to defend him againſt Julius,
who, ſupported by his own dauntleſs ſpirit, and confiding in the
ſacredneſs of his character, had ſet his enemy at defiance. By a happy
and unexpected movement, Chaumont ſurrounded the pope and all his court in
Bologna; and had he not allowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be amuſed by a treaty, which
his profound reſpect for the holy father made him the more willing to hearken
to, he had been able, without any blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, to have reduced him to

               <p>BUONAVISO, an agent of the pope at London, had been corrupted by
the court of France, and had previouſly revealed to Lewis all the meaſures
which Henry was concerting againſt him. But this infidelity did the King
inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable prejudice, in compariſon of what he experienced from the
ſelfiſh purpoſes of the ally, to whom he chiefly truſted for
aſſiſtance. Ferdinand, his father-in-law, had ſo long perſevered in a
courſe of crooked politics, that he began even to value himſelf on his
dexterity in fraud and artifice; and he made a boaſt of thoſe ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſucceſſes. Being told one day, that Lewis the twelfth, a prince of a very
different character, had complained that he had once cheated him: 
<q rend="inline">"He lies, the drunkard!" ſaid he, "I have
cheated him above twenty times."</q> This prince conſidered his cloſe
connexion with Henry, only as the means which ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him the better to take
advantage of his want of experience. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him not to invade France by
the way of Calais, where he himſelf would not have it in his power to
aſſiſt him: 
<note place="margin">Expedition to Fontarabia.</note> He exhorted
him rather to ſend forces to Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarabia, whence he could eaſily make a
conqueſt of Guienne, a province, in which, it was imagined, the Engliſh had
ſtill ſome adherents. He promiſed to aſſiſt this conqueſt by the
junction of a Spaniſh army. And ſo forward did he ſeem to promote the
intereſt of his ſon-in-law, that he even ſent veſſels into England,
to tranſport over the forces which Henry had levied for that purpoſe. The
marqueſs of Dorſet commanded theſe troops, which conſiſted of ten
thouſand men, moſtly infantry; the lord Howard, ſon to the earl of
Surrey, the lord Broke, lord Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rars, and many others of the young gentry and
nobility, accompanied him in this ſervice. All were on fire to
diſtinguiſh themſelves by military atchievements, and to make a
conqueſt of importance for their maſter. The ſecret purpoſe of
Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand in this unexampled generoſity was ſuſpected by no body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0429000101:85"/> THE ſmall kingdom of Navarre lies on the
frontiers between France and Spain; and as John d'Albert, the preſent King,
was connected in friendſhip and alliance with Lewis, the opportunity ſeemed
favourable to Ferdinand, while the Engliſh forces were conjoined with his
own, and while all adherents to the council of Piſa lay under the ſentence
of excommunication, to put himſelf in poſſeſſion of theſe
dominions. No ſooner, therefore, was Dorſet landed in Guipiſcoa, than the
Spaniſh monarch declared his readineſs to join him with his forces, to make
jointly an invaſion of France, and to form the ſiege of Bayonne, which
opened the way into Guienne<note n="*" place="bottom">Herbert. Hollingſhed, p
813.</note>: But he remarked, how dangerous it might prove to leave behind them
the kingdom of Navarre, which, being in cloſe alliance with France, could
eaſily give admittance to the enemy, and cut off all communication between
Spain and the combined armies. To provide againſt ſo dangerous an event, he
required, that John ſhould ſtipulate a neutrality in the preſent war; and
when that prince expreſſed his willingneſs to enter into any engagement
for that purpoſe, he alſo required that he ſhould give ſecurity for his
ſtrict obſervance of it. John having likewiſe agreed to this condition,
Ferdinand demanded, that he ſhould deliver into his hands ſix of the moſt
conſiderable places of his dominions, together with his eldeſt ſon as a
hoſtage. Theſe were not conditions to be propoſed to a ſovereign; and
as the Spaniſh monarch expected a refuſal, he gave immediate orders to the
duke of Alva, his general, to make an invaſion of Navarre, and to reduce the
whole kingdom to ſubjection. Alva ſoon made himſelf maſter of all the
ſmaller towns; and being ready to form the ſiege of Pampeluna, the capital,
he ſummoned the marquis of Dorſet to join him with the Engliſh army, and
to concert together all their operations.</p>
               <p>DORSET began to ſuſpect, that his maſter's intereſts
were very little regarded in all theſe tranſactions; and having no orders
to invade the kingdom of Navarre, or make war any where but in France, he
refuſed to take any part in that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize .<note place="margin">Deceit of
Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand.</note> He remained therefore in his quarters at Fontarabia; but
ſo politic was the contrivance of Ferdinand, that even while the Engliſh
army lay in that ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, it was almoſt equally ſerviceable to his
purpoſes, as if it had acted in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with his own. It kept the French
army in awe, and prevented it from advancing to ſuccour the kingdom of
Navarre; ſo that Alva, having full leiſure to conduct the ſiege, made
himſelf maſter of Pampeluna, and obliged John to ſeek for ſhelter in
France. The Spaniſh general applied again to Dorſet, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to
conduct with united councils the operations of the <hi>holy league,</hi> ſo
it was called, againſt Lewis: But as he ſtill declined forming the ſiege
of Bayonne, and rather inſiſted on the invaſion of the principality of
Bearne, a part of the King <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0429000101:86"/> of Navarre's dominions, which
lies on the French ſide of the Pyrences, Dorſet, juſtly ſuſpicious of
his ſiniſter intentions, repreſented, that, without new orders from his
maſter, he could not concur in ſuch an undertaking. In order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
ſuch orders, Ferdinand diſpatched Martin de Ampios, as his envoy, to
Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and perſwaded Henry, that, by the refractory and ſcrupulous humour
of the Engliſh general, the moſt favourable opportunities were loſt, and
that it was neceſſary he ſhould, in all things, act in concert with the
Spaniſh commander, who was beſt acquainted with the ſituation of the
country, and the reaſons of every operation. But before orders to this
purpoſe reached Spain, Dorſet had become extremely impatient; and
obſerving that his farther ſtay ſerved not to promote the main
undertaking, and that his army was daily periſhing by want and ſickneſs,
he demanded ſhipping from Ferdinand to tranſport them back into England.
Ferdinand, who was bound by treaty to furniſh him with this ſupply,
whenever demanded, was at laſt, after many delays, obliged to yield to his
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity; and Dorſet embarked his troops, and prepared himſelf for the
voyage. 
<note place="margin">Return of the Engliſh.</note> Mean while, a
meſſenger arrived with orders from Henry, that the troops ſhould remain
in Spain; but the ſoldiers were ſo diſcontented with the treatment which
they had met with, that they mutinied, and obliged their commanders to ſet
ſail for England. Henry was much diſpleaſed with the ill ſucceſs of
this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize; and it was with difficulty, that Dorſet, by explaining the
fraudulent intentions of Ferdinand, was at laſt able to appeaſe him.</p>
               <p>THERE happened this ſummer an action at ſea, which brought
not any more deciſive advantage to the Engliſh. Sir Thomas Knevet, maſter
of Horſe, was ſent to the coaſt of Britanny with a fleet of forty-five
ſail; and he carried with him Sir Charles Brandon, Sir John Carew, and many
other young courtiers, who longed for an opportunity of diſplaying their
valour. After committing ſome depredations, a French fleet of thirty-nine
ſail iſſued from Breſt, under the command of Primauget<note n="*" place="bottom">Or rather Porſmauget, according to P. Daniel's conjecture,
vol. II. p. 1901. Hence the Engliſh ſeamen called him Sir Pierce
Morgan.</note>, and began an engagement with the Engliſh. Primauget's ſhip
was ſet on fire, who finding his deſtruction inevitable, bore down upon the
veſſel of the Engliſh admiral, and grappling with her, reſolved to make
her ſhare the ſame fate. The ſhips of both fleets ſtood ſome t me in
ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, as ſpectators of this dreadful engagement; and all men ſaw
with horror the flames which conſumed both veſſels, and heard the cries
of fury and deſpair which came from the miſerable combatants. At laſt,
the French veſſel blew up; and at the ſame time deſtroyed the

                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0429000101:87"/> THE war, which England waged againſt
France, though it brought little advantage to the former kingdom, was of
infinite prejudice to the latter; and by obliging Lewis to withdraw his forces
for the defence of his own dominions, loſt him that ſuperiority, which his
arms, in the beginning of the campaign, had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Italy. Gaſton de
Foix, his nephew, a young hero, had been entruſted with the command of the
French forces; and in a few months performed ſuch feats of military art and
proweſs, as were ſufficient to render illuſtrious the whole life of the
oldeſt captain<note n="*" place="bottom">Guicciard, lib. 10.</note>. His
carreer finiſhed with the great battle of Ravenna, which, after the moſt
obſtinate conflict, he gained over the Spaniſh and papal armies. He
periſhed the very moment his victory was compleat; and with him periſhed
the fortune of the French arms in Italy. The Swiſs, who had rendered
themſelves extremely formidable by their bands of diſciplined infantry,
invaded the Milaneſe with a numerous army, and raiſed up that inconſtant
people to a revolt againſt the dominion of France.

                  <note place="margin">A Parliament.</note> HENRY had ſummoned a
new ſeſſion of Parliament<note n="‡" place="bottom">4th of November,
1512.</note>, and obtained a ſupply for his enterprize. It was a poll-tax,
and impoſed different ſums, according to the ſtation and riches of the
perſon. A duke payed ten marks, an earl five pounds, a lord four pounds, a
knight four marks; every man valued at eight hundred pounds in goods, four
marks. An impoſition was alſo granted of two fifteenths and four
tenths<note n="§" place="bottom">Stowe.</note>. With theſe ſupplies,
joined to the treaſure which was left by his father, and which was not yet
entirely diſſipated, he was enabled to levy a great army, and render
himſelf very formidable to his enemy. The <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0429000101:88"/> Engliſh are
ſaid to have been much encouraged in this enterprize, by the arrival of a
veſſel in the Thames under the papal banner. It carried preſents of wine
and hams to the King, and all the moſt eminent courtiers; and ſuch fond
devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was at that time entertained towards the court of Rome, that theſe
trivial preſents were every where received with the greateſt triumph and
exultation.</p>
               <p>IN order to prevent all diſturbance from Scotland, while the
King's arms ſhould be employed on the continent, Dr. Weſt, Dean of
Windſor, was diſpatched in an embaſſy to James, the King's
brother-in-law; and inſtructions were given him to accommodate all
differences between the kingdoms, as well as diſcover the intentions of the
court of Scotland<note n="*" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</note>.
Some complaints had already paſſed on both ſides. One Barton, a
Scotchman, having ſuffered ſome injuries from the Portugueze, for which he
could obtain no redreſs, had procured letters of marque againſt that
nation; but not content with this liberty, he committed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations upon the
Engliſh, and much infeſted the narrow ſeas<note n="†" place="bottom">Stowe, p. 489. Hollingſhed, p. 811.</note>. Lord How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard and Sir
Edward Howard, admirals, and ſons to the earl of Surrey, ſailing out
againſt him, fought him in a deſperate rencounter, where the pyrate was
killed; and they brought his ſhips into the Thames. As Henry refuſed all
ſatisfaction for this act of juſtice, ſome of the borderers, who wanted
but a pretence for depredations, entered England under the command of lord
Hume, warden of the marches, and committed great ravages on that kingdom.
Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe mutual grounds of diſſatisfaction, matters might
eaſily have been accommodated, had it not been for Henry's intended
invaſion of France, which rouzed up the jealouſy of the Scotch nation<note n="‡" place="bottom">Buchannan, lib. 13. Drummond in the life of James
IV.</note>. The antient league, which ſubſiſted betwixt France and
Scotland, was conceived to be the ſtrongeſt band of connexion; and the
Scotch univerſally believed, that, were it not for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance which
they received from this foreign alliance, they had never been able ſo long to
maintain their independance againſt a people ſo much ſuperior in force
and riches. 
<note place="margin">War with Scotland.</note> James was farther
incited to take part in the quarrel by the invitations of Anne, queen of

firſt ſent a ſquadron of ſhips to the aſſiſtance of France; the
only fleet which Scotland ſeems ever to have poſſeſſed. And though he
made profeſſion ſtill to maintain a neutrality, the Engliſh
ambaſſador eaſily foreſaw, that a war would <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0429000101:89"/> prove
in the end inevitable, and he gave his maſter warning of the danger, who
ſent the earl of Surrey to put the borders in a poſture of defence, and to

this appearance of a diverſion from the North; and ſo much the leſs, that
he flattered himſelf with the aſſiſtance of all the conſiderable
potentates of Europe in his invaſion of France. The pope ſtill continued to
thunder out his excommunications againſt Lewis, and all the adherents to the
ſchiſmatical council: The Swiſs cantons made profeſſions of the
moſt violent animoſity againſt France: The ambaſſadors of Ferdinand
and Maximilian had ſigned with thoſe of Henry a treaty of alliance
againſt that power, and had ſtipulated the time and place of their intended
inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: And though Ferdinand diſavowed his ambaſſador, and even
ſigned a truce for a twelvemonth with the common enemy; Henry was not yet
fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his ſelfiſh and ſiniſter intentions, and ſtill
hoped for his concurrence after the expiration of that term. He had now got a
miniſter who complied with all his inclinations, and flattered him in every

excellent capacity, he was admitted into the marquis of Dorſet's family as
tutor to that nobleman's children, and ſoon gained the friendſhip and
countenance of his patron<note n="*" place="bottom">Stowe, p. 997.</note>. He was
recommended as chaplain to Henry the ſeventh, and being employed by that
monarch in a ſecret negotiation, which regarded his intended marriage with
Margaret of Savoy, Maximilian's daughter, he acquitted himſelf to the King's
ſatisfaction, and obtained the praiſe both of diligence and dexterity in
his conduct<note n="†" place="bottom">Cavendiſh, Fiddes's life of

than three days after, to ſee Wolſey preſent himſelf before him; and
ſuppoſing that he had protracted his departure, he began to reprove him for
the dilatory execution of his orders. Wolſey informed him, that he was juſt

<q rend="inline">"But on ſecond thoughts," ſaid the King, "I

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0429000101:90"/> of myſelf to execute what, I knew, muſt be your
majeſty's intentions."</q> The death of Henry, ſoon after this incident,
was the reaſon why Wolſey reaped no advantage from the good opinion, which
that monarch had entertained of him: But from that moment he was looked on at
court as a riſing man; and the biſhop of Wincheſter caſt his eye upon
him as one, who might be ſerviceable to him in his preſent ſituation<note n="*" place="bottom">Antiq. Brit. Ecleſ. p. 309. Polydore Virgil, lib.
27.</note>. This prelate, obſerving that the earl of Surrey had total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eclipſed him in favour, reſolved to introduce Wolſey into the young
prince's familiarity, and hoped, that he might rival Surrey in his
inſinuating arts, and yet be contented to act in the cabinet a part
ſubordinate to Fox himſelf, who had promoted him. In a very little time,
Wolſey gained ſo much on Henry's good graces, that he ſupplanted both
Surrey in his favour, and Fox in his truſt and confidence. Being admitted to
the King's parties of pleaſure, he took the lead in every jovial
converſation, and promoted all that frolic and entertainment, which he found
ſuitable to the age and inclination of the young monarch. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his own
years, which were near forty, nor his character of a clergyman, were any
reſtraint upon him, or engaged him to check, by any uſeleſs ſeverity,
the gaiety, in which Henry, who had ſmall propenſion to debauchery,
paſſed his careleſs hours. During the intervals of amuſement he
introduced buſineſs and ſtate affairs, and inſinuated thoſe maxims of
conduct, which he was deſirous his maſter ſhould adopt. He obſerved to
him, that, while he entruſted his affairs into the hands of his father's
counſellors, he had the advantage of employing men of wiſdom and
experience, but men who owed not their promotion to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and who
ſcarce thought themſelves accountable to him for the exerciſe of their
authority: That by the factions, and cabals, and jealouſies, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
among them, they more obſtructed the advancement of his affairs, than they
promoted it by the knowledge which age and practice had conferred upon them:
That while he thought proper to paſs his time in thoſe pleaſures, to
which his age and royal fortune invited him, and in thoſe ſtudies, which
would in time enable him to ſway the ſcepter with abſolute authority, his
beſt ſyſtem of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be to intruſt his authority into the
hands of ſome one perſon, who was the creature of his will, and who could
entertain no view but of promoting his ſervice: And that if this miniſter
had alſo the ſame reliſh for pleaſure with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the ſame
taſte for ſcience; he could the more eaſily account to him for his whole
conduct, and introduce his maſter gradually into the knowledge of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0429000101:91"/> HENRY entered into all the views of
Wolſey; and finding no one ſo capable of executing this plan of
adminiſtration as the perſon who propoſed it, he ſoon advanced his
favourite, from being the companion of his careleſs hours, to be a member of
his council; and from being a member of his council, to be his ſole and
abſolute miniſter. 
<note place="margin">His character.</note> By this rapid
advancement and uncontrouled autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the character and genius of Wolſey
had full opportunity to diſplay itſelf. Inſatiable in his acquiſitions,
but ſtill more magnificent in his expence: Of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive capacity, but
ſtill more unbounded enterprize: Ambitious of power, but ſtill more
deſirous of glory: Inſinuating, engaging, perſuaſive; and, by turns,
lofty, elevated, commanding: Haughty to his equals, but affable to his
depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; oppreſſive to the people, but liberal to his friends; more
generous than grateful; leſs moved by injuries than by contempt; he ſeemed
framed to take the aſcendant in every intercourſe with others, but exerted

               </p>
               <p>THE branch of adminiſtration, in which Henry moſt exerted
himſelf, while he gave his entire confidence to Wolſey, was the military,
which, as it ſuited the natural gallantry and bravery of his temper, as well
as the ardour of his youth, was the principal object of his attention. Finding,
that Lewis had made great preparations both by ſea and land to reſiſt
him, he was no leſs careful to raiſe a formidable army and equip a
conſiderable fleet for the invaſion of France. The command of the fleet was
entruſted to Sir Edward Howard; who, after ſcouring the channel ſome
time, preſented himſelf before Breſt, where the French navy then lay; and
he challenged them to a combat. The French admiral, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the
Mediterranean a reinforcement of ſome Gallies under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Prejeant
de Bidoux, kept within the harbour, and ſaw with patience the Engliſh burn
and deſtroy the country in the neighbourhood. At laſt Prejeant arrived with
ſix gallies, and put into Conquet, a place within a few leagues of Breſt,
where he ſecured himſelf behind ſome batteries, which he had planted on
rocks, that lay on each ſide of him. 
<note place="margin">25th April.</note> Howard was
notwithſtanding determined to make an attack; and as he had but two gallies,
he took himſelf the command of one, and gave the other to Devereux lord
Ferrars. He was followed by ſome row-barges and ſome crayers under the
command of Sir Thomas Cheyney, Sir William Sidney, and other officers of
diſtinction. He immediately faſtened on Prejeant's ſhip, and leaped on
board of her, attended with one Carroz, a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh cavalier, and ſeventeen
Engliſh more. The cable, meanwhile, which faſtened his ſhip to that of
the enemy, being cut, the admiral was thus left in the hands of the French; and
as he ſtill continued the fight with great gallantry, he was 
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0429000101:92"/> puſhed overboard by their pikes<note n="*" place="bottom">It was a maxim of Howard's, that no admiral was good for any
thing, that was not brave even to a degree of madneſs. As the ſea-ſervice
requires much leſs plan and contrivance and capacity than the land, this
maxim has great plauſibility and appearance of truth: Tho' the fate of Howard
himſelf may ſerve as a proof that even there courage ought to be tempered
with diſcretion.</note>. Lord Ferrars, ſeeing the admiral's galley fall
off, followed with the other veſſels; and the whole fleet was ſo
diſcouraged by the loſs of their admiral, that they retired from before
Breſt<note n="†" place="bottom">Stowe, p. 491. Herbert, Hollingſhed,
p. 816.</note>. The French navy came out of harbour; and even ventured to
invade the coaſt of Suſſex. They were repulſed, and Prejeant, their
admiral, loſt an eye by the ſhot of an arrow. Lord Howard, brother to the
deceaſed admiral, received the command of the Engliſh fleet; and little
memorable paſſed at ſea during this ſummer.</p>
               <p>GREAT preparations had been making at land, during the whole
winter, for an invaſion of France by the way of Calais; but the ſummer was
well advanced before every thing was in ſufficient readineſs for the
intended enterprize. The long peace, which the kingdom had enjoyed, had
ſomewhat unfitted the Engliſh for military expeditions; and the great
change, which had lately been introduced in the art of war, had rendered it
ſtill more difficult to inure them to the uſe of the weapons now employed
in action. The Swiſs, and after them the Spaniards, had ſhown the advantage
of a ſtable infantry, who fought with pike and ſword, and were able to
repulſe even the heavy-armed cavalry, in which the great force of the armies
formerly conſiſted. The practice of fire-arms was become very common; tho'
the caliver, which was the weapon now uſed, was ſo inconvenient, and
attended with ſo many diſadvantages, that it had not entirely diſcredited
the uſe of bows, a weapon in which the Engliſh excelled all European
nations. The Engliſh archers ſtill maintained their reputation; and even
during the preſent reign, the king's allies had ſollicited him for
ſupplies of this kind. The ſecond year after his acceſſion, he ſent a
thouſand archers, under the command of lord Dacres, to the aſſiſtance
of Ferdinand, his father-in-law, in his projected expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition againſt the
Moors of Barbary; but as that prince turned his arms againſt the French in
Italy, Darcy was ſent back without being employed in any ſervice. The King
had alſo ſent fifteen hundred archers under the command of Sir Edward
Poinings to the aſſiſtance of Margaret, dutcheſs of Savoy, who made
uſe of them with great advantage againſt the duke of Guelders, the great
diſturber of the Netherlands. A conſiderable part of the forces, which
Henry now levied for the invaſion of France, conſiſted alſo of archers;
and ſo ſoon as affairs were in readineſs, the vanguard of the army,
amounting to 8000 men, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the earl of Shrewſbury, ſailed
over to Calais. Shrewſbury was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0429000101:93"/> with the
earl of Derby, the lords Fitzwater, Haſtings, Cobham, and Sir Rice ap Thomas,
captain of the light horſe. Another Body of 6000 men ſoon after followed
under the command of lord Herbert, the chamberlain, attended with the earls of
Northumberland and Kent, the lords Audley and Delawar, together with Carew,

               <p>THE King himſelf prepared to follow with the main body and
rear of the army; and he appointed the queen regent of the kingdom during his
abſence. That he might ſecure her adminiſtration from all diſturbance,
he ordered Edmond de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, to be beheaded in the Tower, the
nobleman who had been attainted and impriſoned during the late reign. The
King was led to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this act of violence by the dying commands, as is
imagined, of his father, who told him, that he never would be free from danger,
while a man of ſo tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent a diſpoſition as Suffolk was alive. And as
his brother, Richard de la Pole, had accepted of a command in the French
ſervice, and attempted very fooliſhly to revive the York faction, and to
animate them againſt Henry, he probably drew more ſuddenly the King's
vengeance on the unhappy Suffolk.</p>

                  <note place="margin">30th of June.</note> AT laſt, Henry,
attended with the duke of Buckingham and many others of the nobility, arrived
in Calais, and entered upon his French expedition, whence he fondly expected
ſo much ſucceſs and glory<note n="*" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil, lib.
27. Belcarius, lib. 14.</note>. Of all thoſe allies, on whoſe
aſſiſtance he ſo much relied, the Swiſs alone fully performed their
engagements. 
<note place="margin">Invaſion of France.</note> Being put in
motion by a ſum of money ſent them by Henry, and incited by their victories
obtained in Italy, and by their animoſity againſt France, they were
prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enter that kingdom with an army of twenty-five thouſand men;
and no equal force could be oppoſed to their incurſion. Maximilian had
received an advance of 120,000 crowns from Henry, and had engaged to reinforce
the Swiſs with 8000 men, but failed in his engagements. That he might make
atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the King, he himſelf appeared in the Low Countries, and joined
the Engliſh army with ſome German and Flemiſh ſoldiers, who were
uſeful in giving an example of diſcipline to Henry's new-levied forces.
Obſerving the diſpoſition of the Engliſh monarch to be more bent on
glory than on intereſt, he inliſted himſelf in his ſervice, wore the
croſs of St. George, and received pay, a hundred crowns day, as one of his
ſubjects and captains. But while he exhibited this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
ſpectacle, of an emperor of Germany ſerving under a King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he
was treated with the higheſt reſpect by Henry, and really directed all the
operations of the combined army.</p>
               <p>BEFORE the arrival of Henry and Maximilian in the camp, the earl
of Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury and lord Herbert had formed the ſiege of Teroüane, a
town ſituate on <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0429000101:94"/> the frontiers of Picardy; and they began
to attack the place with vigour. Teligini and Crequi commanded in the town, and
had a garriſon, which exceeded not a thouſand men; yet made they ſuch
ſtout reſiſtance as protracted the ſiege a month; and they found
themſelves at laſt more in danger from want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and ammunition
than from the aſſaults of the beſiegers. Having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed intelligence of
their ſituation to Lewis, who had advanced to Amiens with his army, that
prince gave orders to throw relief into the place. 
<note place="margin">16th Auguſt.</note> Fontrailles appeared at
the head of 800 horſemen, each of whom carried a ſack of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder behind
him, and two quarters of bacon. With this ſmall force he made a ſudden and
unexpected irruption into the Engliſh camp, and ſurmounting all
reſiſtance, advanced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the foſſee of the town, where each
horſeman threw down his burthen. They immediately returned at the gallop, and
were ſo fortunate as again to break thro' the Engliſh, and to receive
little or no loſs, in this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous attempt<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Battle of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negate.</note> BUT the
Engliſh had, ſoon after, full revenge for that inſult. Henry had
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived intelligence of the approach of the French Horſe, who had advanced
to protect this incurſion of Fontrailles; and he ordered ſome troops to
paſs the Lis, in order to oppoſe them. The cavalry of France, tho' they
conſiſted chiefly of gentlemen, who had behaved with great valour in many
deſperate actions in Italy, were, on ſight of the enemy, ſeized with ſo
unaccountable a panic, that they immediately took to flight, and were purſued
by the Engliſh. The duke of Longueville, who commanded the French, Buſſi
d'Amboiſe, Clermont, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercourt, the chevalier Bayard, and many other
officers of diſtinction were taken priſoners<note n="†" place="bottom">Memoires de Bellai<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> liv. 1. Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.
Hollingſhed, p. 822. Herbert.</note>. This action, or rather rout, is
ſometimes called the battle of Guinegate, from the place where it was fought;
but more commonly the <hi>battle of Spurs,</hi> becauſe the French, that day,
made more uſe of their ſpurs than of their ſwords or military
weapons.</p>
               <p>AFTER ſo conſiderable an advantage, the King, who was at the
head of a compleat army of above 50,000 men, might have made incurſions to
the gates of Paris, and ſpread confuſion and deſolation every where. It
gave Lewis great joy, when he heard, that the Engliſh, inſtead of puſhing
their victory, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking the diſmayed troops of France, returned to the
ſiege of an inconſiderable place like Teroüane. The governors were
obliged ſoon after to ſurrender the town; and Henry found his acquiſition
of ſo little conſequence, tho' gained at the expence of ſome blood, and
what, in his preſent circumſtances, was more important, of much valuable
time, that he immediately demoliſhed the fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0429000101:95"/> The anxieties of the French were again renewed with regard to the
motions of the Engliſh. The Swiſs at the ſame time had entered Burgundy
with a very formidable army, and laid ſiege to Dijon, which was in no
condition to reſiſt them. Ferdinand himſelf, tho' he had made a truce
with Lewis, ſeemed diſpoſed to lay hold of every advantage which fortune
ſhould preſent to him. Scarce ever was the French monarchy in greater
danger, or leſs in a condition to defend itſelf againſt thoſe powerful
armies, which on every ſide aſſailed or threatened it. Even many of the
inhabitants of Paris, who believed themſelves expoſed to the rapacity and
violence of the enemy, began to diſlodge, without knowing what place could
afford them greater ſafety and protection.</p>
               <p>BUT Lewis was extricated from his preſent difficulties by the
manifeſt blunders of his enemies. The Swiſs allowed themſelves to be
ſeduced into a negotiation by Tremoüille, governor of Burgundy; and
without making enquiry, whether he had any powers to treat, they accepted of
the conditions which he offered them. Tremoüille, who knew, that he would
be diſavowed by his maſter, ſtipulated whatever they were pleaſed to
demand; and thought himſelf happy, at the expence of ſome payments, and
very large promiſes, to get rid of ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable an enemy<note n="‡" place="bottom">Memoires du mareſchal de Fleuranges Beliarius, lib.
14.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE meaſures of Henry ſhowed equal ignorance in the art of
war with thoſe of the Swiſs in negotiation. Tournay was a great and rich
city, which, tho' it lay within the frontiers of Flanders, belonged entirely to
France, and afforded the troops of that kingdom a paſſage into the middle
of the Netherlands. Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, who was deſirous to free his grandſon from
ſo troubleſome a neighbourhood, adviſed Henry to lay ſiege to this
place; and the Engliſh monarch, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that ſuch an
acquiſition no way advanced his conqueſts in France, was ſo imprudent as
to follow this intereſted council. The city of Tournay, by its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
charters, being exempted from the burthen of a garriſon, the burghers, even
againſt the remonſtrance of their ſovereign, ſtrenuouſly inſiſted
on maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this dangerous privilege; and they engaged, by themſelves, to
make a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous defence againſt the enemy<note n="*" place="bottom">Memoires
de Fleuranges.</note>. Their courage failed them when matters came to
extremity; 
<note place="margin">24th Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> and after a few days
ſiege, the place was ſurrendered to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. Henry ſo little
regarded its privileges, that he immediately quartered a garriſon in it,
under the command of Sir Edward Poinings. The biſhop of Tournay was lately
dead; and as a new biſhop was already elected by the chapter, but not
inſtalled in his office, the King beſtowed the adminiſtration of the
ſee on his favourite, Wolſey, and put him in immediate poſſeſſion
of the <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0429000101:96"/> revenues, which were conſiderable<note n="†" place="bottom">Strype's Memorials, vol. 1. p. 5, 6.</note>. Hearing
of the retreat of the Swiſs, and obſerving the ſeaſon to be far
advanced, he thought proper to retire into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and he carried the
greateſt part of his army with him. Succeſs had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him in every
enterprize; and his youthful mind was much elated with this ſeeming
proſperity; but all men of judgment, comparing the advantages of his
ſituation with his progreſs, his expences with his acquiſitions, were
convinced, that this campaign, ſo much vaunted, was, in reality, both ruinous
and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious<note n="‡" place="bottom">Cuicciardini.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE ſucceſs, which, during this ſummer, had attended
Henry's arms in the north, was much more deciſive. The King of Scotland had
ſummoned out the whole force of his kingdom; and having paſſed the Tweed
with a brave, tho' a tumultuary army of above 50,000 men, he ravaged thoſe
parts of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland which lay neareſt that river, and employed himſelf
in taking the caſtles of Norham, Etal, Werke, Ford, and other places of
little importance. The lady Ford, a woman of great beauty, being taken
priſoner in her caſtle, was preſented to James, and ſo gained on the
affections of that monarch, that he waſted in idle pleaſure that critical
time, which, during the abſence of his enemy, he ſhould have employed in
puſhing his conqueſts. His troops, lying in a barren country, where they
ſoon conſumed all the proviſions, began to be pinched with neceſſity;
and as the authority of the prince was feeble, and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary diſcipline,
during that age, extremely relaxed, many of them had ſtolen from the camp,
and retired to their houſes. Mean while, the earl of Surrey, having collected
a force of 26,000 men, of which 5000 had been ſent over from the King's army
in France, marched to the defence of the country, and approached the Scotch,
who lay on ſome high ground near the hills of Cheviot. The river Till ran
between the armies, and prevented an engagement: Surrey therefore ſent a
herald to the Scotch camp, challenging them to deſcend into the plain of
Milfield, which lay towards the ſouth; and there, appointing a day for the
combat, try their valour on equal ground. As he received no ſatisfactory
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, he made a feint of marching towards Berwic; as if he intended to
enter Scotland, to lay waſte the borders, and cut off the proviſions of the
enemy. The Scotch army, in order to prevent his purpoſe, put themſelves in
motion; and having ſet fire to the huts in which they had quartered, they
deſcended from the hills. Surrey, taking advantage of the ſmoke, which was
blown towards him, and which covered his movements, paſſed the Till with
his artillery and vanguard at the bridge of Twiſel, and ſent the reſt of
his army to find a ſord farther up the river.</p>

right wing, Sir Marmaduke Conſtable the left. The earl of Surrey himſelf
commanded the main body of the ſecond line, lord Dacres the right wing, Sir
Edward Stanley the left. The Scotch front preſented three diviſions to the
enemy: The middle was led by the King himſelf: The right by the earl of
Huntley, aſſiſted by lord Hume: The left by the earls of Lenox and
Argyle. A fourth diviſion under the earl of Bothwel made a body of
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. Huntley began the battle; and after a ſharp conflict, put to
flight the left wing of the Engliſh, and chaced them off the field: But on
returning from the purſuit, he found the whole Scotch army in great
diſorder. The diviſion under Lenox and Argyle, elated with the ſucceſs
of the other wing, had broke their ranks, and notwithſtanding the
remonſtrances and entreaties of La Motte, the French ambaſſador, had
ruſhed headlong upon the enemy. Not only Sir Edmond Howard, at the head of
his diviſion, received them with great valour; but Dacres, who commanded in
the ſecond line, wheeling about during the action, fell upon their rear, and
put them to the ſword without reſiſtance. The diviſion under the King
himſelf and that under Bothwel, animated by the valour of their leaders,
ſtill made head againſt the Engliſh, and throwing themſelves into a
circle, protracted the action till night ſeparated the combatants. The
victory ſeemed yet uncertain, and the numbers which fell on each ſide were
nearly equal, amounting to above 5000 men: But the morning diſcovered
evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently where the advantage lay. The Engliſh had loſt only perſons of
ſmall note; but the flower of the Scotch nobility had fallen in battle, and
the King himſelf, after the moſt diligent enquiry, could no where be found.
In ſearching the field, the Engliſh met with a dead body, which reſembled
him, and was arrayed in a ſimilar habit; and they put it in a lead coffin and
ſent it to London. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome time it was kept unburied; becauſe James
died under ſentence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, on account of his confederacy with
France, and his oppoſition to the holy ſee<note n="†" place="bottom">Buchannan, lib. 13. Herbert.</note>: But upon Henry's application,
who pretended that that prince, in the inſtant before his death, had
diſcovered ſigns of repentance, abſolution was given him, and his body
was interred. The Scotch, however, ſtill aſſerted, that it was not
James's body, which was found in the field of battle, but that of one
Elphinſton, who had been arrayed in arms reſembling the King's, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to divide the attention of the Engliſh, and ſhare the danger with his
maſter. <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0429000101:98"/> It was believed that James had been ſeen
croſſing the Tweed at Kelſo; and ſome imagined that he had been killed
by the clients of lord Hume, whom that noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had inſtigated to commit
ſo enormous a crime. But the populace enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the opinion, that he was
ſtill alive, and having gone ſecretly in pilgrimage to the holy land, would
ſoon return, and take poſſeſſion of the throne. This fond conceit was
long entertained in Scotland.</p>
               <p>THE King of Soots and moſt of the chief nobility being killed
in the field of Flouden, ſo this battle was called, a very inviting
opportunity was offered to Henry of gaining advantages over that kingdom,
perhaps of reducing it to ſubjection. But he diſcovered on this occaſion
a mind truly great and generous. When the queen of Scotland, Margaret, who was
created regent during the infancy of her ſon, applied for peace, he readily
granted it; and took compaſſion of the helpleſs condition of his
ſiſter and nephew. <label type="milestone">

Norfolk, which had been forfeited by his father, for engaging on the ſide of

of Surrey. Sir Charles Brandon, his favourite, whom he had before created

France, ſome other inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents had happened, which more than counterballanced
this fortunate event, and ſerved to open his eyes with regard to the
raſhneſs of an undertaking, into which his youth and high fortune had
betrayed him.</p>
               <p>LEWIS, fully ſenſible of the dangerous ſituation to which
his kingdom had been reduced during the former campaign, was reſolved, by
every expedient, to prevent the return of like perils, and to break the
confederacy of his enemies. The pope was no way diſpoſed to puſh the
French to extremity; and provided they returned not to take poſſeſſion
of Milan, his intereſt rather led him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ballance among the
contending parties. He accepted therefore of Lewis's offer to renounce the
council of Lyons; and he took off the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication which his
predeceſſor and himſelf had denounced againſt that King and his
kingdom. Ferdinand was now faſt declining in years, and as he entertained no
farther ambition than that of keeping poſſeſſion of Navarre, which he
had ſubdued by his arms and policy, he readily hearkened to the propoſals
of Lewis for prolonging the truce another year; and he even ſhowed an
inclination of <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0429000101:99"/> forming a more intimate connexion with that
monarch. Lewis had dro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t hints of
his intention to marry his ſecond daughter, Renée, either to Charles,
prince of Spain, or his brother, Ferdinand, both of them grandchildren to the
Spaniſh monarch; and he declared his reſolution of beſtowing on her, as
her portion, his claim to the dutchy of Milan. Ferdinand not only embraced
theſe ſchemes with avidity; but alſo engaged the emperor, Maximilian, in
the ſame views, and procured his conſent to a treaty, which opened ſo
inviting a proſpect of aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing their common grandchildren.</p>
               <p>WHEN Henry was informed of Ferdinand's renewal of the truce with
Lewis, he fell into the moſt violent rage, and loudly complained, that his
father-in-law had firſt, by the higheſt promiſes and profeſſions,
engaged him in enmity with France, and afterwards, without giving him the
leaſt warning, had now again ſacrificed his intereſt to his own
ſelfiſh purpoſes, and had left him expoſed alone to all the dangers and
expences of the war. In proportion to his eaſy credulity and unſuſpecting
reliance on Ferdinand, was the vehemence with which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt the
treatment, which he met with; and he threatened revenge for this egregious
treachery and breach of Faith<note n="*" place="bottom">Petrus de Angleria,
Epiſ. 545, 546.</note>. But he loſt all patience when informed of the other
negotiation, where Maximilian was alſo ſeduced from his alliance, and where
propoſals had been hearkened to, for the marriage of the prince of Spain with
the daughter of France. Charles, during the life-time of the late King, had
been affianced to Mary, Henry's ſecond ſiſter; and as the prince now
approached the age of puberty, the King had expected the immediate completion
of the marriage, and the honourable ſettlement of a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>er, for whom he had entertained a very tender affection.
Such a complication, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of injuries gave him the higheſt
diſpleaſure, and inſpired him with a deſire of expreſſing his
diſdain towards thoſe who had taken advantage of his youth and
inexperience, and had abuſed his too great facility.</p>
               <p>THE duke of Longueville, who had been made priſoner at the
battle of Guine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and who was ſtill detained in England, was ready to
take advantage of all theſe diſpoſitions of Henry, in order to procure a
peace and even an alliance, which he knew to be ſo paſſionately deſired
by his maſter. He repreſented to the King, that Anne, queen of France,
being lately dead, a door was thereby opened for an affinity, which might tend
to the advantage of both kingdoms, and which would ſerve to terminate
honourably all the differences between them: That ſhe had left Lewis no male
children; and as he had ever entertained a ſtrong deſire of having heirs to
the crown, no marriage ſeemed more ſuitable to him than that with the 
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0429000101:100"/> princeſs of England, whoſe youth and beauty afforded
the moſt flattering hopes in that particular: That tho' the marriage of a
princeſs of ſixteen, with a King of fifty three, might ſeem unſuitable;
yet the other advantages, attending the alliance, were more than a ſufficient
compenſation for this inequality: And that Henry, in looſening his
connexions with Spain, whence he had never experienced any advantage, would
contract a cloſe affinity with Lewis, a prince, who, thro' his whole life,
had invariably maintained the character of probity and honour.</p>
               <p>AS Henry ſeemed to hearken to this diſcourſe with very
willing ears, Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville informed his maſter of the probability, which he
diſcovered, of bringing this matter to a happy concluſion; and he received
full powers for negotiating the treaty.

                  <note place="margin">7th of Auguſt.</note> The articles were

that Henry ſhould receive payment of a million of crowns, being the arrears
due by treaty to his father and himſelf; and that the princeſs Mary

               <p>FRANCIS, duke of Angouleme, a youth of one and twenty, who had
married Lewis's eldeſt daughter, ſucceeded him on the throne; and by his
activity, valour, generoſity, and other virtues, gave prognoſtics of a
happy and glorious reign. This young monarch had been extremely ſtruck with
the charms of the Engliſh princeſs; and even during his predeceſſor's
life-time, had payed her ſuch cloſe attendance, as made ſome of his
friends apprehend that he had entertained views of gallantry towards her. But
being warned, that, by indulging himſelf in this paſſion, he might
readily exclude his own title to the throne, he fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and even watched the young dowages with a very careful eye during the firſt

Henry's chief favourite; and that monarch had even once entertained thoughts of
marrying him to his ſiſter, and had given indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to that mutual
paſſion, which took place between them. The queen aſked Suffolk, whether
he had now the courage, without farther reflection, to eſpouſe her; and
ſhe told him, that her brother would more eaſily forgive him for not
aſking his conſent, than for acting contrary to his orders. Suffolk
declined not ſo inviting an offer; and the marriage was ſecretly compleated
at Paris. Francis, who was pleaſed with this marriage, as it prevented Henry
from forming any powerful alliance by means of his ſiſter<note n="*" place="bottom">Petrus de Angleria, Epiſt. 544.</note>, interpoſed his good
offices in appealing him: And even Wolſey, having entertained no jealouſy
of Suffolk, who was content to participate in the King's pleaſures, and had
no ambition to interpoſe in ſtate affairs, was active in reconciling the
King to his ſiſter and brother-in-law; and he obtained them permiſſion
to return to England.</p>

numerous enemies, whom Wolſey's ſudden elevation, his aſpiring character,
and his haughty deportment had raiſed, ſerved only to rivet him faſter in
Henry's confidence; who placed a pride in ſupporting the choice, which he had
made, and who was incapable of yielding either to the murmurs of the people or
the diſcontents of the great. That artful prelate likewiſe, well 
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0429000101:102"/> acquanted with the King's imperious temper, concealed
from him the abſolute aſcendant, which he acquired; and while he ſecretly
directed all public councils, he ever pretended a blind ſubmiſſion to the
will and authority of his maſter. By entering into the King's pleaſures, he
ſtill preſerved his affections; by conducting his buſineſs, he
gratified his indolence; and by his unlimited complaiſance in both
capacities, he prevented all that jealouſy, to which his exorbitant
acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and his ſplendid, oſtentatious train of life ſhould
naturally have given birth. The archbiſhoprick of York falling vacant by the
death of Bambrige, Wolſey was promoted to that ſee, and reſigned the
biſhoprick of Lincoln. Beſides en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the adminiſtration of Tournay,
he got poſſeſſion, at very low leaſes, of the revenues of Bath,
Worceſter, and Hereford, biſhopricks filled by Italians, who were allowed
to reſide abroad, and who were glad to compound for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, by
parting with a conſiderable ſhare of their profits. He held in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendam
the abbey of St. Albans, and many other church preferments. He was even allowed
to unite with the ſee of York, firſt that of Durham, next that of
Wincheſter; and there ſeemed to be no end of his acquiſitions. His
advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in eccleſiaſtical dignity ſerved him as a pretence for
engroſſing ſtill more revenues: The pope, obſerving his great influence
over the King, was deſirous of engaging him in his intereſt, and had
created him a cardinal. Never church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, under colour of exacting regard to
religion, carried to a more exorbitant height, the ſtate and dignity of that
character. His train conſiſted of eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſervants, of whom many
were knights and gentlemen: Some even of the nobility put their children into
his family as a place of education; and in order to ingratiate them with their
patron, allowed them to bear offices as his ſervants. Whoever was
diſtinguiſhed by any art or ſcience payed court to the cardinal; and none
payed court in vain. Literature, which was then in its infancy, found in him a
generous patron; and both by his public inſtitutions and private bounty, he
gave encouragement to every branch of erudition<note n="*" place="bottom">Eraſm. Epiſt lib. 2. Epiſt. 1. lib. 16. Epiſt. 3.</note>.
Not content with this munificence, which gained him the approbation of the
wiſe, he ſtrove to dazzle the eyes of the populace, by the ſplendour of
his equipage and furniture, the coſtly embroidery of his liveries, the
luſtre of his apparel. He was the firſt cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman in England who wore
ſilk and gold, not only on his habit, but alſo on his ſaddles and the
trappings of his horſes<note n="†" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil, lib.
27. Stowe, p. 501. Holligſhed, p. 847.</note>. He cauſed his cardinal's hat
to be borne aloft by a perſon of rank; and when he came to the King's chapel,
would permit it to be laid on no place but the altar. A prieſt, the talleſt
and moſt comely <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0429000101:103"/> he could find, carried before him a
pillar of ſilver, on whoſe top was placed a croſs: But not content with
this parade, to which he thought himſelf intitled as cardinal, he provided
another prieſt of equal ſtature and beauty, who marched along, bearing the
croſs of York, even in the dioceſe of Canterbury; contrary to the antient
rule and agreement between the prelates of theſe rival ſees.<note n="*" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</note>. The people made merry with the
cardinal's oſtentation; and ſaid they were now ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that one
croſs alone was not ſufficient for the expiation of his ſins and
offences.</p>
               <p>WARHAM, chancellor and archbiſhop of Canterbury, a man of a
very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate temper, averſe to all diſpute, choſe rather to retire from
public employment, than maintain an unequal conteſt with the haughty
cardinal. He reſigned his office of chancellor; and the ſeals were
immediately intruſted to Wolſey. If this new accumulation of dignity
encreaſed his enemies, it alſo ſerved to exalt his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal character,
and prove the extent of his capacity. A ſtrict adminiſtration of juſtice
took place during his enjoyment of this high office; and no chancellor ever
diſcovered greater impartiality in his deciſions, deeper penetration of
judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or more enlarged knowledge of law and equity<note n="†" place="bottom">Sir Thomas More. Stowe, p. 504.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE duke of Norfolk, finding the King's money almoſt all
exhauſted by projects and pleaſures, while his inclination for expence
ſtill continued, was glad to reſign his office of treaſurer, and retire
from court. His rival, Fox, biſhop of Wincheſter, profited not by his
abſence; but partly overcome by years and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, partly diſguſted
at the aſcendant acquired by Wolſey, withdrew himſelf entirely to the
care of his dioceſe. The duke of Suffolk had alſo taken offence, that the
King, by the cardinal's perſwaſion, had refuſed to pay a debt, which he
had contracted during his abode in France; and he thenceforth affected to live
in privacy. Theſe incidents left Wolſey to enjoy without a rival the whole
power and favour of the King; and put into his hands every ſpecies of
authority. In vain, did Fox, before his retirement, warn the King 
<q rend="inline">"not to ſuffer the ſervant to be greater

few months after her huſband's death, ſhe eſpouſed the earl of Angus,
of the name of Douglas, a nobleman of great family and very promiſing hopes.
Some of the nobility now propoſed the election of Angus as regent, and
recommended this choice as the moſt likely means of preſerving peace with
England: But the jealouſy of the great families, and the fear of exalting the
Douglaſſes, begot oppoſition to this meaſure. Lord Hume in particular,
the moſt powerful chieftain in the kingdom, inſiſted on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling the
duke of Albany, ſon to a brother of James the third, who had been baniſhed
into France, and who, having there married, had leſt poſterity, that were
the next heirs to the crown, and the neareſt relations to their young
ſovereign. Albany, though firſt prince of the blood, had never been in
Scotland, was totally unacquainted with the manners of the people, ignorant of
their ſituation, unprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed in their language; yet ſuch was the favour
attending the French alliance, and ſo great the authority of Hume, that this
prince was invited to accept the reins of government. Francis, careful not to
give offence to the King of England, detained Albany ſome time in France; but
at laſt, ſenſible how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant it was to keep Scotland in his
intereſts, he permitted him to go over, and take poſſeſſion of the
regency: He even renewed the antient league with that kingdom, tho' it implied
ſuch a cloſe connexion, as might be thought ſomewhat to infringe his
alliance with England.</p>
               <p>WHEN the regent arrived in Scotland, he made enquiries
concerning the ſtate of the country, and character of the people; and
diſcovered a ſcene, with which he was hitherto but little acquainted. That
turbulent kingdom, he found, was rather to be conſidered as a confederacy,
and that not a cloſe one, of petty princes, than a regular ſyſtem of
civil polity; and even the King, much more the regent, poſſeſt an
authority very uncertain and precarious. Arms, more than laws, prevailed; and
courage, preſerably to equity or juſtice, was the virtue moſt valued and
reſpected. The nobility, in whom the whole power reſided, were ſo

and the deſire of proſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
the deadly feuds, (ſo they were called) ſtill appeared to be paſſions
the moſt predominant among that uncultivated people.</p>
               <p>THE perſons, to whom Albany firſt applied for information
with regard to the ſtate of the country, happened to be inveterate enemies of
Hume<note n="*" place="bottom">Buchanan, lib. 14. Drummond.</note>; and they
repreſented that powerful nobleman as the chief ſource of public
diſorders, and the great obſtacle to the execution of the laws, and
adminiſtration of juſtice. Before the authority of the magiſtrate could
be eſtabliſhed, it was neceſſary, they ſaid, to make an example of
this great offender; and by the terror of his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, teach all
leſſer criminals to pay reſpect to the power of their ſovereign.
Albany, moved by theſe reaſons, was induced to forget Hume's paſt
ſervices, to which he had been, in a great meaſure, beholden for the
regency; and he no longer bore towards him that favourable countenance, with
which he was wont to receive him. Hume perceived the change, and was incited,
both by views of his own ſecurity and his revenge, to take meaſures in
oppoſition to the regent. He applied himſelf to Angus and the queen
dowager, and repreſented to them the danger to which the infant prince was
expoſed, from the ambition of Albany, the next heir to the crown, to whom the
ſtates had imprudently entruſted the whole authority of government. By his
perſwaſion, ſhe formed the deſign of carrying off the young King, and
putting him under the protection of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and when that conſpiracy
was diſcovered, ſhe herſelf, accompanied with Hume and Angus, withdrew
into England, where ſhe was ſoon after delivered of a daughter.</p>
               <p>HENRY, in order to check the authority of Albany and the French
party, gave encouragement to theſe malecontents, and aſſured them of his
protection. Matters being afterwards in appearance accommodated between Hume
and the regent, that nobleman returned into his own country; but mutual
ſuſpicions and jealouſies ſtill prevailed. He was committed to
cuſtody, under the care of the earl of Arran, his brother-in-law; and was,
for ſome time, detained priſoner in his caſtle. But having perſwaded
Arran to enter into the conſpiracy with him, he was allowed to make his
eſcape; and he openly made war upon the regent. A new accommodation enſued,
no more ſincere than the foregoing; and Hume was ſo imprudent as to put
himſelf, together with his brother, into the hands of <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0429000101:106"/>
the regent. They were immediately ſeized, committed to cuſtody, brought to
their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>al, condemned, and executed.
No legal crime was proved againſt theſe brothers: It was only alleged,
that, at the battle of Flouden, they had not done their duty in ſupporting
the King; and as this backwardneſs could not, from the whole courſe of
their paſt life, be aſcribed to cowardice, it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly imputed to a
more criminal motive. The evidences, however, of guilt produced againſt them,
were far from being valid or convincing; and the people, who hated them while
alive, were very much diſſatisfied with their execution.</p>
               <p>SUCH violent remedies often produce, for ſome time, a
deceitful tranquillity; but as they deſtroy mutual confidence, and beget the
moſt inveterate animoſities, their conſequences are commonly very ſatal
both to the public, and to thoſe who make trial of them. The regent, however,
took advantage of the preſent calm which prevailed; and being invited by the
French king, who was, at that time, willing to gratify Henry, he went over into
France; and was detained there during five years. A great part of his authority
he entruſted into the hands of Darcy, a Frenchman, whom he created warden of
the marches, and who was extremely vigilant in the diſtribution of juſtice,
and the puniſhment of crimes and oppreſſion. But Sir David Hume, a
kinſman of the nobleman lately executed, deſirous of revenging his friend's
death on the friend of the regent, way-laid Darcy near Dunſe; and after
reproaching him with that execution, made an attack upon him. Darcy finding
himſelf too weak to reſiſt, and truſting to the ſwiftneſs of his
horſe, fled towards Dunbar; but being ignorant of the roads, he ran into a
bog, was overtaken by the purſuers, and put to death. As he wore long flowing
hair, Hume, exulting in this aſſaſſination as a gallant exploit, cut
out theſe locks, and pleating them into a wreath, wore them ever after at the
pummel of his ſaddle<note n="*" place="bottom">Buchanan, lib. 14.

marched his armies towards the ſouth of France; pretending, that his ſole

Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roüenne was alſo regarded as a breach of treaty. But above all, what
tended to alienate the court of England, was the diſguſt which Wolſey had
taken againſt the French monarch.</p>
               <p>HENRY, on the conqueſt of Tournay, had refuſed to admit
Lewis Gaillart, the biſhop elect, to the poſſeſſion of the
temporalities, becauſe that prelate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined taking the oath of allegiance
to his new ſovereign; and Wolſey was appointed, in his room,
adminiſtrator of the biſhoprick. As the cardinal wiſhed to obtain free
and undiſturbed poſſeſſion, he applied to Francis, and deſired him
to beſtow on Gaillart ſome ſee of equal value in France, and to obtain
his reſignation of Tournay. Francis, who ſtill hoped to recover
poſſeſſion of that city, and who feared that the full ſettlement of
Wolſey in the biſhopric would prove an obſtacle to his purpoſe, had
hitherto neglected to gratify the haughty prelate; and the biſhop of Tournay,
by applying to the court of Rome, had obtained a bull for his ſettlement in
that ſee. Wolſey, who expected to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with in every requeſt, and
who exacted reſpect even from the greateſt monarchs, reſented the
ſlight put upon him by Francis; and he puſhed his maſter to ſeek an

               <p>MAXIMILIAN the emperor was ready to embrace every propoſal of
a new en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, eſpecially if attended with an offer of money, of which he
was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely greedy, extremely prodigal, and extremely neceſſitous.

commiſſion to propoſe ſome conſiderable payments to Maximilian<note n="†" place="bottom">Petrus de Angleria, epiſt. 568.</note>: He thence made a journey
into Switzerland; and by like motives engaged ſome of the cantons to
furniſh troops to the emperor. That prince invaded Italy with a
conſiderable army; but being repulſed from before Milan, he retreated with
his army into Germany, made peace with France and Venice, delivered Verona to
that republic for a ſum of money, and thus excluded himſelf, in ſome
meaſure, from all future acceſs into Italy. And Henry found, that, after
expending five or ſix hundred thouſand ducats, in order to gratify the
cardinal's reſentment, he had only looſened his alliance with Francis,
without diminiſhing the power of that prince.</p>
               <p>THERE were many reaſons, which engaged the King not to proceed
farther at preſent in his enmity againſt France. He could hope for
aſſiſtance from no power in Europe. Ferdinand, his father in law, who had
often deceived him, was now declining faſt from age and infirmities; and a
ſpeedy end was looked for to the long and proſperous reign of that great
monarch. Charles, prince of Spain, ſovereign of the Low Countries, deſired
nothing but peace with Francis, who had it ſo much in his power, if provoked,
to obſtruct his peaceable acceſſion to that rich inheritance, which was
waiting him. The pope was overawed by the power of France, and Venice was
engaged in a cloſe alliance with that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy<note n="‡" place="bottom">Guicciardini, lib. 12.</note>. Henry therefore remained in
tranquillity during ſome time; and ſeemed to give himſelf no concern with
regard to the affairs of the continent. In vain did Maximilian endeavour to
allure him into ſome expence, by offering to make a reſignation of the
imperial crown in his favour. That artifice was too groſs to ſucceed even
with a prince ſo little political as Henry; and Pace, his envoy, who was
perfectly well acquainted with the emperors motives and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, gave him
warning, that the ſole view of that prince in making him ſo liberal an
offer, was to draw money from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">15th January.</note> WHILE an univerſal
peace prevailed in Europe, that event happened, which had ſo long been looked
for, and from which ſuch important conſequences were expected, the death of
Ferdinand, the catholic, and the ſucceſſion of his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Charles,
to his extenſive dominions. No commotion, however, or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration followed
immediately upon that great incident. This young prince, who had not yet
reached his ſixteenth year, was already a great ſtateſman, from the
excellent education which he had received, and from the mature and ſolid
judgment, with which nature had endowed him. He was ſenſible how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
it was to preſerve peace with foreigners, till he ſhould have
eſtabliſhed <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0429000101:110"/> his authority in his new dominions; and
finding Francis deſirous to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his preſent ſituation, he
made him an offer of ſuch terms as gained the friendſhip and alliance of
that monarch. He engaged to marry Francis's daughter, tho' only an infant of a
year old; to receive as her dowry all her father's pretenſions on the kingdom
of Naples; to pay him a hundred thouſand crowns a year, till the
conſummation of the marriage; and to give the King of Navarre ſatisfaction
with regard to his dominions<note n="*" place="bottom">Recueil de Traités

received to the government of theſe united kingdoms. The right of
ſucceſſion lay in his mother, Joan, who was ſtill alive; but as ſhe
was uſually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered in her judgment, Ferdinand had left the

inſinuation and addreſs, qualities for which he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, to procure
himſelf a place in Wolſey's good graces. After the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador had
ſucceeded in his purpoſe, he took an opportunity of expreſſing his
maſter's regret, that, by miſtakes and miſapprehenſions, he had been
ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate as to loſe a friendſhip, which he ſo much valued as
that of his eminence. Wolſey was not deaf to theſe honourable advances from
ſo great a monarch; and he was thenceforth obſerved to expreſs himſelf,
on all occaſions, in favour of the French alliance. The more to engage him in
his intereſts, Francis entered into ſuch confidence with him, that he
aſked his advice even in his moſt ſecret affairs, and on all difficult
emergencies had recourſe to him as to an oracle of wiſdom and profound
policy. The cardinal made no ſecret to the King of this private
correſpondence; and Henry was ſo prepoſſeſſed in favour of the
great capacity of his miniſter, that, he ſaid, he verily believed he would
govern Francis as well as himſelf<note n="‡" place="bottom">Polydore

               <p>WHEN matters ſeemed ſufficiently prepared, Bonnivet opened
to the cardinal his maſter's deſire of recovering Tournay; and Wolſey
immediately, without heſitation, engaged to effectuate his purpoſe. He took
an opportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0429000101:111"/> to the King and
council, that Tournay lay ſo remote from Calais, that it would be very
difficult, if not impoſſible, in caſe of a war, to keep the communication
open between thoſe two places: That as it was ſituate on the frontiers both
of France and the Netherlands, it was expoſed to the attacks of both theſe
powers, and muſt neceſſarily, either by force or famine, fall into the
hands of the firſt aſſailant: That even in time of peace, it could not be
preſerved without a large garriſon, to reſtrain the numerous and mutinous
inhabitants, ever diſcontented with the Engliſh government: And that the
poſſeſſion of Tournay, as it was thus precarious and expenſive, ſo
was it entirely uſeleſs, and gave little or no acceſs to annoy, on
occaſion, the dominions either of Charles or of Francis.</p>
               <p>THESE reaſons were of themſelves very convincing, and were
ſure of meeting with no oppoſition, when they came from the mouth of the
cardinal. 
<note place="margin">Tournay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to France.</note> A treaty
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was entered into for the delivering up of Tournay; and in order to
give to that meaſure a more graceful appearance, it was agreed, that the
Dauphin and the princeſs Mary, both of them infants, ſhould be betrothed,
and that this city ſhould be conſidered as the dowry of the princeſs.
Such kinds of agreement were then common among ſovereigns, tho' it was very
rare, that the intereſts and views of the parties continued ſo ſteady as
to render the intended marriages effectual. But as Henry had been at
conſiderable expence in building a citadel at Tournay, Francis agreed to pay
him 600,000 crowns at twelve yearly pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to put into his hands eight
hoſtages, all of them men of quality, for the performance of the article<note n="*" place="bottom">Memoires du Bellay, liv. 1.</note>. And leſt the cardinal
ſhould think himſelf neglected in theſe ſtipulations, he promiſed him
a yearly penſion of twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand livres, as an equivalent for his
adminiſtration of the biſhopric of Tournay. He alſo engaged to recall
Albany from Scotland.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS having ſucceeded ſo well in this negotiation, began
to enlarge his views, and to hope for more conſiderable advantages, by
practiſing on the vanity and ſelf conceit of this haughty favourite. He
redoubled his flatteries to the cardinal, conſulted him more frequently in
every doubt or difficulty, called him in each letter, <hi>father, tutor,
governor,</hi> and profeſſed the moſt unbounded deference to his advice
and opinion. All thoſe careſſes were preparatives to a negotiation for
the delivery of Calais, in conſideration of a ſum of money to be paid for
it; and if we may credit Polydore Virgil, who bears a particular ſpite to
Wolſey, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his being diſpoſſeſſed of his employment and
thrown into priſon by that miniſter, ſo extravagant a propoſal met with
a very favourable reception from the cardinal. He ventured not, however, to lay
the matter before the council: <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0429000101:112"/> He was contented to
ſound privately the opinions of men, by dropping hints in converſation, as
if he thought Calais a uſeleſs burthen to the kingdom<note n="†" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</note>: But when he found, that all men
were ſtrongly riveted in a contrary perſwaſion, he thought it dangerous
to proceed any farther in his purpoſe; and falling, ſoon after, into new
attachments with the King of Spain, the great friendſhip between Francis and
him began gradually to decline.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Wolſey ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</note> THE
enormous pride of Wolſey was now farther encreaſed by a great acceſſion
of dignity and power which he had received. Cardinal Campeggio had been ſent
as legate into England, in order to procure a tythe from the clergy, for
enabling the pope to oppoſe the progreſs of the Turks; a danger which was
real, and was formidable to all chriſtendom, but which had been ſo often
made uſe of to ſerve the intereſted purpoſes of the court of Rome, that
it had loſt all influence on the minds of the people. The Clergy refuſed to
comply with Leo's demand: Campeggio was recalled; and the King deſired of the
pope, that Wolſey, who had been joined in this commiſſion, might alone be
inveſted with the legantine power, together with the right of viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all
the clergy and monaſteries, and even with ſuſpending the whole laws of
the church during a twelve month. Wolſey, having obtained this new dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
made a new diſplay of that ſtate and parade, to which he was ſo much
addicted. On ſolemn feaſt-days, he was not contented without ſaying
maſs after the manner of the pope himſelf: Not only he had biſhops and
abbots to ſerve him; he even engaged the firſt nobility to give him water
and the towel. He affected a rank ſuperior to what had ever been claimed by
any churchman in England. Warham, the primate, having wrote him a letter, where
he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed himſelf, <hi>your loving brother,</hi> Wolſey complained
of his preſumption, in thus challenging an equality with him. When Warham was
told what offence he had given, he made light of the matter. 
<q rend="inline">"Know ye not," he ſaid, "that this man is
drunk with too much proſperity."</q>

                     </gap> that office.</note> BUT
Wolſey carried the matter much farther than vain pomp and oſtentation. He
erected an office, which he called the legantine court; and as he was now, by
means of the pope's commiſſion and the King's favour, inveſted with all
power, both eccleſiaſtical and civil, no man knew what bounds were to be
ſet to the authority of this new tribunal. He conferred on it a ſpecies of
inquiſitorial and cenſorial powers even over the laiety, and directed it to
examine into all matters of conſcience; into all conduct which had given
ſcandal; into all actions, which, though they eſcaped the law, might appear
contrary to good morals. Offence was juſtly taken at this commiſſion,
which was really unbounded; and <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0429000101:113"/> the people were the more
diſg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

licences of pleaſure, ſo ſevere in repreſſing the leaſt appearance
of immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality in others. But to render his court more obnoxious, Wolſey made
one John Allen the judge in it, a perſon of ſcandalous life<note n="*" place="bottom">Strype's Memorials, vol. 1. p. 125.</note>, whom he himſelf, as
chancellor, had condemned for perjury: And as this man either exacted fines
from every one whom he was pleaſed to find guilty, or took bribes to drop
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, men concluded, and with ſome appearance of reaſon, that he
ſhared with the cardinal theſe wages of iniquity. The clergy, and in
particular the monks, were expoſed to this tyranny; and as the libertiniſm
of their lives often gave a juſt handle againſt them, they were obliged to
buy an indemnity, by paying large ſums of money to the legate or his judge.
Not contented with this authority, Wolſey pretended, by virtue of his
commiſſion, to aſſume the power of all the biſhops courts;
particularly that of judging of Wills and Teſtaments; and his deciſions in
theſe important points were eſteemed not a little arbitrary. As if he
himſelf were pope, and as if the pope could diſpoſe abſolutely of every
eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment, he preſented to whatever priories or
benefices he pleaſed, without regard to the right of election in the monks,
or of patronage in the nobility and gentry<note n="†" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27. This whole narration has been copied by
all the hiſtorians from the author here cited: There are many
circumſtances, however, very ſuſpicious, both becauſe of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
partiality of the hiſtorian, and becauſe the parliament, when they
afterwards examined Wolſey's conduct, could find no proof for any material
crime he had committed.</note>.</p>
               <p>NO one durſt carry to the King any complaint againſt theſe
uſurpations of Wolſey, till Warham ventured to inform him of the
diſcontents of his people. Henry profeſſed his ignorance of the whole
matter. 
<q rend="inline">"A man," ſaid he, "is not ſo blind any where
as in his own houſe: But do you, father," added he to the primate, "go to
Wolſey, and tell him, if any thing be amiſs, that he amend it."</q> A
reproof of this kind was not likely to be effectual: It only ſerved to
augment Wolſey's enmity to Warham: But one London having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Allen,

                  <note place="margin">Death of the emperor Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imilian.</note>
Maximilian the emperor died, a man, who, of himſelf, was indeed of little
conſequence; but as his death left vacant the firſt ſtation among
chriſtian princes, it put all men's ſpirits into agitation, and proved a
kind of aera in the general ſyſtem of Europe. The Kings of France and Spain
immediately declared themſelves candidates for the imperial throne; and
employed every expedient of money or intrigue, which promiſed them
ſucceſs in ſo great a point of ambition. Henry alſo was encouraged to
put in his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; but his miniſter, Pace, who was diſpatched to
the electors, found that he began to ſollicit too late, and that the votes of
all theſe princes were already pre engaged either on the one ſide or the
other.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS and Charles made profeſſion from the beginning of
carrying on this rivalſhip with emulation, but without enmity; and Francis in
particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that his brother Charles and he were, fairly and openly,
ſuitors to the ſame miſtreſs: The more fortunate, added he, will carry
her; and the other muſt reſt contented<note n="*" place="bottom">Belcario,
lib. 16. Guicciardin, lib. 13.</note>. But all men apprehended, that this
extreme moderation, however reaſonable, would not be of long duration; and
that incidents would certainly occur to ſharpen the minds of the candidates
againſt each other. 
<note place="margin">Charles, King of Spain, choſen
empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</note> It was Charles who at laſt prevailed, to the great
diſappointment of the French monarch, who ſtill continued in the belief,
that the majority of the electoral college was engaged in his favour. And as he
was ſome years ſuperior in age to his rival, and, after his victory at
Marignan, and conqueſt of the Milaneſe, much ſuperior in renown, he could
not ſuppreſs his indignation, at being thus, in the face of all mankind,
after long and anxious expectation, poſt-poned in ſo important a
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion. From this concurrence, as much as from oppoſition of
intereſt, aroſe that emulation between thoſe two great monarchs, which,
while it kept their whole age in agitation, ſets them in ſo remarkable a
contraſt to each other: Both of them princes endowed with talents and
abilities; brave, aſpiring, active, induſtrious; beloved by their
ſervants and ſubjects, dreaded by their enemies, and reſpected by all the
world: Francis, open, frank, liberal, munificent, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying theſe virtues to
an exceſs which prejudiced his affairs: Charles, political, cloſe,
artificial, frugal; better calculated to obtain ſucceſs in wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s and in nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations, eſpecially
the latter. The one, the more amiable man; the other, the greater monarch. The
King, from his overſights and indiſcretions, naturally expoſed to
misfortunes; but qualified, by his ſpirit and magnanimity, to extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
himſelf from them with honour: The emperor, by his deſigning, intereſted 
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0429000101:115"/> character, fitted, in his greateſt ſucceſſes to
excite jealouſy and oppoſition even among his allies, and to rouze up a
multitude of enemies, in the place of one whom he had ſubdued. And as the
perſonal qualities of theſe princes thus counterpoiſed each other, ſo
did the advantages and diſadvantages of their dominions. Fortune alone,
without the concurrence of prudence or valour, never reared up of a ſudden
ſo great a power as that which centered in the emperor Charles. He reaped the
ſucceſſion of Caſtile, of Arragon, of Auſtria, of Burgundy: He
inherited the conqueſt of Naples, of Granada: Election entitled him to the
empire: Even the bounds of the globe ſeemed to be enlarged a little before
his time, that he might poſſeſs the whole treaſures, as yet entire and
unrifled, of the new world. But tho' the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all theſe advantages
formed an empire greater and more extenſive than any known in Europe ſince
that of the Romans, the kingdom of France alone, being cloſe, compact,
united, rich, populous, and being interpoſed between all the provinces of
Charles's dominions, was able to make a vigorous oppoſition to his
progreſs, and maintain the conteſt againſt him.</p>
               <p>HENRY poſſeſſed that felicity, of being able, both by
the native force of his kingdom and its ſituation, to hold the ballance
between thoſe two powers; and had he known to improve, by policy and
prudence, this ſingular and ineſtimable advantage, he was really, by means
of it, a greater prince than either of thoſe mighty monarchs, who ſeemed to
ſtrive for the dominion of Europe. But the character of this King was
heedleſs, inconſiderate, capricious, impolitic; guided by his paſſion
or his favourite; vain, imperious, haughty; ſometimes actuated by
friendſhip for foreign powers, oftener by reſentment, ſeldom by his true
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. And thus, tho' he triumphed in that ſuperiority which his
ſituation in Europe gave him, he never employed it to the eſſential and
durable advantage of his kingdom or his own.</p>

at Dover; and he immediately haſtened thither with the queen, in order to
give a ſuitable reception to his royal gueſt. That great prince, politic
tho' young, having heard of the intended interview between Francis and Henry,
was apprehenſive of the conſequences, and was reſolved to take the
opportunity, in his paſſage from Spain to the Low Countries, to make the
King ſtill a higher compliment, by paying him a viſit in his own dominions.
Beſides the marks of regard and attachment which he gave to Henry, he
ſtrove, by every teſtimony of friendſhip, by flatteries, proteſtations,
promiſes and preſents, to gain on the vanity, the avarice, and the ambition
of the cardinal. He here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled into this aſpiring prelate the hope of
attaining the papacy; and as that was the ſole point of elevation, beyond his
preſent greatneſs, it was ſure to attract his wiſhes with the ſame
ardour, as if fortune had never, as yet, favoured him with any of her
preſents. In hopes of reaching this dignity by the emperor's
aſſiſtance, he ſecretly devoted himſelf to that monarch's
intereſts; and Charles was perhaps the more liberal of his promiſes, that
Leo was a very young man; and it was not likely, that, for many years, he would
be called upon to fulfil his engagements. Henry eaſily obſerved this
courtſhip payed to his miniſter; but inſtead of taking umbrage at it, he
only made it a ſubject of vanity; and believed, that, as Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey's ſole
ſupport was his favour, the obeiſance of ſuch mighty monarchs to his
ſervant, was in reality a more conſpicuous homage to his own grandeur.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">30th of May.</note> THE day of Charles's
departure, Henry went over to Calais with the queen and his whole court; and
from thence proceeded to Guiſnes, a ſmall town near the frontiers. Francis,
attended in like manner, came to Andres, a few miles diſtant; and the two
monarchs met, for the firſt time, in the fields, at a place ſituate between
theſe two towns, but ſtill within the Engliſh pale: For Francis agreed to
pay that compliment to Henry, in conſideration of that prince's paſſing
the ſea, that he might be preſent at the interview. Wolſey, to whom both
Kings had entruſted the regulation of the ceremonial, contrived this
circumſtance, in order to do honour to his maſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0429000101:117"/> THE two monarchs, after ſaluting each
other in the moſt cordial manner, retired into a sent which had been erected
on purpoſe, and they held a ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference together. Henry here
propoſed to make ſome amendments on the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of their former alliance;
and he began to read the treaty, <hi>I Henry King:</hi> Theſe were the
firſt words; and he ſtopt a moment. He ſubjoined only the words, <hi>of
England,</hi> without adding, <hi>France,</hi> the uſual of the Engliſh
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs<note n="*" place="bottom">Memoires de Fleuranges.</note>. Francis
remarked this delicacy, and expreſſed by a ſmile his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
it.</p>
               <p>HE took an opportunity ſoon after of paying a compliment to
Henry of a more eſſential nature. That generous prince, full of honour
himſelf, and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of diſtruſting others, was ſhocked at all the
precautions which were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, whenever he had an interview with the
Engliſh monarch: The number of their guards and attendants was carefully
counted on both ſides: Every ſtep was ſcrupulouſly meaſured and
adjuſted: And if the two Kings propoſed to pay a viſit to the queens,
they departed from their ſeveral quarters at the ſame inſtant, which was
marked by the firing of a culverin; they paſſed each other in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
point between the places; and at the ſame inſtant that Henry entered
Ardres, Francis put himſelf into the hands of the Engliſh at Guiſnes. In
order to break off this tedious ceremony, which contained ſo many
diſhonourable implications, Francis, one day, took with him two gentlemen and
a page, and rode directly into Guiſnes. The guards were ſurprized at the
preſence of the monarch, who called aloud to them, <hi>You are all my
priſoners: Carry me to your maſter.</hi> Henry was equally aſtoniſhed
at the appearance of Francis; and taking him in his arms, 
<q rend="inline">"My brother," ſaid he, "you have here played
me the moſt agreeable trick in the world, and have ſhowed me the full
confidence I may place in you: I ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render myſelf your priſoner from
this moment."</q> He took from his neck a collar of pearls, worth 15000
angels<note n="†" place="bottom">An angel was then eſtimated at ſeven
ſhillings, or near twelve of our preſent money.</note>; and putting it
about Francis's, begged him to wear it, for the ſake of his priſoner.
Francis agreed, but on condition that Henry ſhould wear a bracelet, of which
he made him a preſent, and which was double in value to the collar<note n="‡" place="bottom">Memoires de Fleuranges.</note>. The King went next
day to Ardres, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out guards or attendants; and confidence being now fully
eſtabliſhed between the monarchs, they employed the reſt of the time
entirely in tournaments and feſtivals.</p>
               <p>A DEFIANCE had been ſent by the two Kings to each others
court, and thro' all the chief cities of Europe, importing, that Henry and
Francis, with fourteen aids, would be ready, in the plains of Picardy, to
anſwer all comers, that were <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0429000101:118"/> gentlemen, at tilt,
tourney, and barriers. The monarchs, in order to fulfil this challenge,
advanced into the field on horſeback, Francis ſurrounded with Henry's
guards, and Henry with thoſe of Francis. They were gorgiouſly apparelled;
and were both of them the moſt comely perſonages of the age, as well as the
moſt expert in every military exerciſe. They carried away the prize at all
trials in thoſe rough and dangerous paſtimes; and ſeveral horſes and
riders were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by their vigour and dexterity. The ladies were the
judges in theſe ſeats of chivalry, and put an end to the rencounter
whenever they judged it expedient. Henry erected a ſpacious houſe of wood
and canvas, which had been framed in London; and he here feaſted the French
monarch. He had placed a motto on this fabric, under the figure of an Engliſh
archer embroidered on it, <hi>Cui adhaereo praeeſt. He prevails whom I
favour</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Mezcray.</note>: Expreſſing his own
ſituation, as holding in his hands the ballance of power among the potentates
of Europe. 
<note place="margin">24th of June.</note> In theſe
entertainments, more than in any ſerious buſineſs, did the two Kings
paſs the time, till their departure.</p>
               <p>HENRY, after his return to Calais, paid a viſit to the emperor
and Margaret of Savoy at Gravelines, and engaged them to go along with him to
Calais, and paſs ſome days in that fortreſs. The artful and politic
Charles here compleated the impreſſion, which he had begun to make on Henry
and his favourite, and effaced all the friendſhip, to which the frank and
liberal nature of Francis had given birth. As the houſe of Auſtria began
ſenſibly to take the aſcendant over the French monarchy, the intereſts
of England required that ſome ſupport ſhould be given to the latter, and
above all, that any important wars ſhould be prevented, which might beſtow
on either of them a deciſive ſuperiority over the other. But the jealouſy
of the Engliſh againſt France has ever prevented a cordial union between
theſe nations: And Charles, ſenſible of this hereditary animoſity, and
deſirous farther to flatter Henry's vanity, had made him an offer, (an offer
in which Francis was afterwards obliged to concur) that he ſhould be entire
arbiter in any diſpute or difference that ſhould ariſe between the
monarchs. But the great maſterpiece of Charles's politics was the ſecuring
Wolſey in his intereſts, by very important ſervices, and ſtill higher
promiſes. He renewed aſſurances of aſſiſting him in obtaining the
papacy; and he put him in preſent poſſeſſion of the revenues,
belonging to the ſees of Badajox and Palencia in Caſtile. The
acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of Wolſey were now become ſo exorbitant, that, joined to
the penſions from foreign powers, which Henry allowed him to poſſeſs,
his revenues were computed nearly to equal thoſe which belonged to the crown
itſelf; and he ſpent <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0429000101:119"/> them with a magnificence, or
rather an oſtentation, which gave general offence to the people; and much
leſſened his maſter in the eyes of all foreign nations<note n="*" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil. Hall.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">War between Charles and Francis.</note> THE
violent perſonal emulation and political jealouſy which had taken place
between the emperor and the French King, ſoon broke into action. Francis
ſent an army into Navarre under the command of De Foix, in order to replace
the family of Albert in the poſſeſſion of that kingdom; and this
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize could not have been complained of as a breach of treaty, if De Foix
had confined himſelf to that equitable deſign. But after he had ſubdued
Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre, finding Spain in great diſorder from the inſurrections of the
people, he thought the opportunity favourable, and he ventured, with Francis's
approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to lay fiege to Logrogno in Caſtile. This invaſion, contrary
to what was expected, put an end to the domeſtic diſſentions of the
Caſtilians; who attacked the French, obliged them to raiſe the ſiege,
purſued the advantage, and entirely expelled them Navarre, which has ever
ſince remained united with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh monarchy<note n="†" place="bottom">Vera, hiſt. de Charl. V.</note>. Robert de la Marck, duke of
Boüillon and prince of Sedan, having received ſome diſguſt from the
governeſs of the Low Countries, had taken arms and invaded thoſe provinces;
and had even ſent a challenge or defiance to the emperor himſelf<note n="‡" place="bottom">Memoires de Bellay, lib. 1.</note>: A boldneſs,
which ſeemed entirely unaccountable, except on the ſuppoſition that this
petty prince had received ſecret encouragement from Francis. On the other
hand, Charles, in order to chaſtiſe the inſolence of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, had levied
a powerful army, and advanced to the frontiers of France, which he threatened
with an invaſion. Hoſtilities were ſoon carried farther; his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
beſieged Mouſon, which they took; they inveſted Mezieres, where they met
with a repulſe. In Italy likewiſe the two monarchs were not inactive.
Francis negotiated with the Pope, in order to engage him to concur in expelling
the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts from Naples: But Charles had the addreſs to finiſh his
league with the ſame power for expelling the French from Milan; and the
united arms of the allies had invaded that dutchy, and had almoſt entirely
finiſhed their enterprize.</p>
               <p>WHILE theſe ambitious and warlike princes were committing
hoſtilities on each other in every part of Europe, they ſtill made
profeſſions of the ſtrongeſt deſire of peace; and both of them
carried inceſſantly their complaints to Henry, as to the arbiter or umpire
between them. 
<note place="margin">Mediation of Henry.</note> The King, who
appeared neutral, engaged them to ſend their ambaſſadors to Calais, there
to negotiate a peace under the mediation of Wolſey and the pope's nuntio. The
emperor was well acquainted with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of theſe mediators; and his
demands in the conference were ſo unreaſonable, as plainly proved him
conſcious of this advantage. He required the reſtitution 
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0429000101:120"/> of Burgundy, a province, which had been ceded many years
before by treaty, and which would have given him acceſs into the midſt of
France: And he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be freed from the homage, which his anceſtors had
ever paid for Flanders and Artois, and which he himſelf had, by the treaty of
Noyon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to renew. On Francis's rejecting theſe terms, the
congreſs at Calais broke up, and Wolſey, ſoon after, took a journey to
Bruges, where he met with the emperor. 
<note place="margin">24th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.</note> He was received with
the ſame ſtate, magnificence, and reſpect, as if he had been the King of
England himſelf; and he concluded in his maſter's name an offenſive
alliance with the pope and the emperor againſt France. He engaged that
England ſhould next ſummer invade that kingdom with forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men;
and he betrothed to Charles the princeſs Mary, the King's only child, who had
now ſome proſpect of inheriting the crown. This extravagant alliance, which
was prejudicial to the intereſts, and might have proved fatal to the liberty
and independance of the kingdom, was the reſult of the humours and prejudices
of the King, and the private views and expectations of the cardinal.</p>
               <p>THE people ſaw every day new inſtances of the uncontrouled
authority of this miniſter. 
<note place="margin">Trial and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the duke of
Buckingham.</note> The duke of Buckingham, conſtable of England, the firſt
nobleman both for family and fortune in the kingdom, had been ſo unfortunate
as to give diſguſt to the cardinal, and it was not long before he found
reaſon to repent his indiſcretion. He ſeems to have been a man full of
levity and raſh projects; and being infatuated with judicial aſtrology, he
entertained commerce with one Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, a carthuſian monk, who encouraged him
with the notion of mounting one day the throne of England. He was deſcended
by a female from the duke of Gloceſter, youngeſt ſon of Edward the third;
and tho' his claim to the crown was thereby very remote, he had been ſo
imprudent as to let fall ſome expreſſions, as if he thought himſelf
beſt intitled, in caſe the King ſhould die without iſſue, to
poſſeſs the royal dignity. He had not even abſtained from threats
againſt the King's life, and had provided himſelf of arms, which he
intended to employ, in caſe a favourable opportunity ſhould offer. He was
brought to a trial; and the duke of Norfolk, whoſe ſon, the earl of Surrey,
had married Buckingham's daughter, was created loed ſteward, in order to
preſide at this ſolemn procedure. The jury conſiſted of a duke, a
marquis, ſeven earls, and twelve barons; and they gave ſentence againſt
Buckingham, which was ſoon after put in execution. There is no reaſon to

ſeemed to proceed more from indiſcretion than deliberate malice, the

remarkable during the whole courſe of his reign; and was alone ſufficient
to render him implacable againſt Buckingham. The office of conſtable, which
Buckingham inherited from the Bohuns, earls of Hereford, was forfeited, and was
never after revived by Henry.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>DURING ſome years, many parts of Europe had been agitated with
thoſe religious controverſies, which produced the reformation, one of the
greateſt events in hiſtory: But as it was not till this time, that the King
of England pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly took part in the quarrel, we had no occaſion to give
any account of its riſe and progreſs. It will now be neceſſary to
explain theſe theological diſputes; or what is more material, to trace from
their origin thoſe abuſes, which ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally diffuſed the opinion,
that a reformation of the church or eccleſiaſtical order was become highly
expedient, if not abſolutely neceſſary. We ſhall be better enabled to
comprehend the ſubject, if we take the matter a little higher, and reflect a
moment on the reaſons, why there muſt be an eccleſiaſtical order, and a
public eſtabliſhment of religion in every civilized community. The
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the preſent occaſion will, I hope, excuſe this ſhort
digreſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Digreſſion concerning the
eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſtate.</note> MOST of the arts and profeſſions in a
ſtate are of ſuch a nature, that, while they promote the intereſts of the
ſociety, they are alſo uſeful or agreeable to ſome individuals; and in
that caſe, the conſtant rule of the magiſtrate, except, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, on the
firſt introduction of any art, is, to leave the profeſſion to itſelf,
and truſt its encouragement to the individuals, who reap the benefit of it.
The arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans, finding their profits to riſe by the favour of their
cuſtomers, encreaſe, as <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0429000101:122"/> much as poſſible, their
ſkill and induſtry; and as matters are not diſturbed by any injudicious
tampering, the commodity is always ſure to be at all times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
proportioned to the demand.</p>
               <p>BUT there are alſo ſome callings, which, tho' uſeful and
even neceſſary in a ſtate, bring no advantage nor pleaſure to any
individuals; and the ſupreme power is obliged to alter its conduct with
regard to the retainers of thoſe profeſſions. It muſt give them public
encouragement in order to their ſubſiſtance; and it muſt provide
againſt that negligence, to which they will naturally be ſubject, either by
annexing particular honour to the profeſſion, by eſtabliſhing a long
ſubordination of ranks and a ſtrict dependance, or by ſome other
expedient. The perſons employed in the finances, armies, fleets, and
magiſtracy are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this order of men.</p>
               <p>IT may naturally be thought, at firſt view, that the
eccleſiaſtics belong to the firſt claſs, and that their encouragement,
as well as that of lawyers and phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, may ſafely be truſted to the
liberality of individuals, who are attached to their doctrines, and who find
benefit or conſolation from their ſpiritual miniſtry and
aſſiſtance. Their induſtry and vigilance will, no doubt, be whetted by
ſuch an additional motive; and their ſkill in the profeſſion, as well
as their addreſs in governing the minds of the people, muſt receive daily
encreaſe, from their encreaſing practice, ſtudy, and attention.</p>
               <p>BUT if we conſider the matter more cloſely, we ſhall find,
that this intereſted diligence of the clergy is what every wiſe
legiſlator will ſtudy to avoid; becauſe in every religion, except the
true, it is highly pernicious, and has even a natural tendency to pervert the
true, by infuſing into it a ſtrong mixture of ſuperſtition, folly, and
deluſion. Each ghoſtly practitioner, in order to render himſelf more
precious and ſacred in the eyes of his retainers, muſt inſpire them with
the moſt violent abhorrence againſt all other ſects, and continually
endeavour, by ſome novelty, to excite the languid devotion of his audience.
No regard will be paid to truth, morals, or decency in the doctrines
inculcated. Every tenet will be adopted, that beſt ſuits the diſorderly
affections of the human frame. Cuſtomers will be drawn to each conventicle by
new induſtry and addreſs in practiſing on the paſſions and credulity
of the populace. And in the end, the civil magiſtrate will find, that he has
paid dearly for his pretended frugality, in ſaving a ſettled foundation for
the prieſts; and that in reality the moſt decent and advantageous
compoſition, which he can make with the ſpiritual guides, is to bribe their
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, by affixing ſtated ſallaries to their profeſſion, and
rendering it ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous for them to be farther active, than merely to
preſerve their flock from ſtraying in queſt of new paſtures. And in
this manner eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0429000101:123"/> tho'
commonly they aroſe at firſt from religious views, prove in the end
advantageous to the political intereſts of ſociety.</p>
               <p>BUT we may obſerve, that few eccleſiaſtical
establiſhments have been fixed upon a worſe foundation than that of the
church of Rome, or have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with circumſtances more hurtful to the
peace and happineſs of mankind.</p>
               <p>THE large revenues, privileges, immunities, and powers of the
clergy ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them formidable to the civil magiſtrate, and armed with too
extenſive authority an order of men, who always adhere cloſely together,
and who never want a plauſible pretence for their encroachments and
uſurpations. The higher dignities of the church ſerved, indeed, to the
ſupport of gentry and nobility; but by the eſtabliſhment of
monaſteries, many of the loweſt vulgar were taken from the uſeful arts,
and maintained in thoſe receptacles of ſloth and ignorance. The ſupreme
head of the church was a foreign potentate, who was guided by intereſts,
always different, ſometimes contrary to thoſe of the community. And as the
hierarchy was neceſſarily ſolicitous to preſerve an unity of faith,
rites and ceremonies, all liberty of thought ran a manifeſt riſque of being
extinguiſhed; and violent perſecutions, or what was worſe, a ſtupid and
abject credulity, took place every where.</p>
               <p>TO encreaſe theſe evils, the church, tho' ſhe
poſſeſſed large revenues, was not contented with her acquiſitions,
but retained a power of practiſing farther on the ignorance of mankind. She
even beſtowed on each individual prieſt a power of enriching himſelf by
the voluntary oblations of the faithful, and left him ſtill a powerful motive
for diligence and induſtry in his calling. And thus, that church, tho' an
expenſive and burthenſome eſtabliſhment, was liable to many of the
inconveniencies, which belong to an order of prieſts, truſted entirely to
their own art and invention for attaining a ſubſiſtance.</p>
               <p>THE advantages, attending the Romiſh hierarchy, were but a
ſmall compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for its inconveniencies. The eccleſiaſtical
privileges, during barbarous times, had ſerved as a cheque to the
deſpotiſm of Kings. The union of all the weſtern churches under the
ſupreme pontiff facilitated the intercourſe of nations, and tended to bind
Europe into an immenſe republic. And the pomp and ſplendour of worſhip,
which belonged to ſo opulent an eſtabliſhment, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, in ſome
reſpects, to the encouragement of the fine arts, and began to diffuſe a
general elegance of taſte, by uniting it with religion.</p>
               <p>IT will eaſily be conceived, that, tho' the ballance of evil
prevailed in the Romiſh church, this was not the chief reaſon, which
produced the reformation. A concurrence of incidents muſt have contributed to
forward that great work.</p>

tenth, by his generous and enterprizing temper, had very much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted the
treaſury, and was obliged to make uſe of every invention, which might yield
money, in order to ſupport his projects, pleaſures, and liberalities. The
ſcheme of ſelling indulgences was ſuggeſted to him, as an expedient
which had often ſerved in former times to draw money from the chriſtian
world, and make devout people willing contributors to the grandeur and riches
of the court of Rome. The church, it was ſuppoſed, was poſſeſſed of
a great ſtock of merit, as being intitled to all the good works of the
ſaints, beyond what were employed in their own juſtification; and even to
the merits of Chriſt himſelf, which were infinite and unbounded: And from
this unexhauſted treaſury, the pope might retail particular portions, and
by that traffic acquire money, to be employed in pious purpoſes, the
reſiſting the Turk, or ſubduing ſchiſmatics. When the money came into
his treaſury, the greateſt part of it was uſually diverted to other
purpoſes<note n="*" place="bottom">Father Paul and Sleidan.</note>.</p>
               <p>IT is commonly believed, that Leo, from the penetration of his
genius, and his familiarity with literature, was fully acquainted with the
ridicule and fallacy of the doctrines, which, as ſupreme pontiff, he was
obliged by his intereſt to promote: And it is the leſs wonder, therefore,
that he employed for his profit thoſe pious frauds, which his
predeceſſors, the moſt ignorant and credulous, had always, under
plauſible pretexts, made uſe of for their ſelfiſh purpoſes. He
publiſhed the ſale of a general indulgence<note n="†" place="bottom">In 1517.</note>; and as his expences had not only exhauſted his
uſual revenue, but even anticipated the income of this extraordinary
expedient, the ſeveral branches of it were openly given away to particular
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who were entitled to levy the impoſition. The produce
particularly of Saxony and the countries bordering on the Baltic was
aſſigned to his ſiſter, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene, married to Cibo, natural ſon of
Innocent the eighth; and ſhe, in order to enhance her profit, had farmed out
the revenue to one Arcemboldi, a Genoeſe, now a biſhop, formerly a

profeſſion<note n="‡" place="bottom">Father Paul, Sleidan.</note>. The
Auſtin friars had uſually been employed in Saxony to preach the
indulgences, and from this truſt had derived both profit and

them means to ſecret the money<note n="§" place="bottom">Father Paul, lib.

to prove themſelves worthy of the diſtinction conferred on them,
exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated the benefit of indulgences by the moſt unbounded panegyrics; and
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced doctrines on that head, which, tho' not more ridiculous than thoſe
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received, were ſuch as the ears of the people were not yet fully
accuſtomed <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0429000101:125"/> to. To add to the ſcandal, the collectors
of this revenue are ſaid to have lived very licentious lives, and to have
ſpent in taverns, gaming houſes, and places ſtill more infamous, the
money, which devout perſons had ſaved from their uſual expences, in order
to purchaſe a remiſſion of their ſins<note n="*" place="bottom">Father

               <p>ALL theſe circumſtances might have given offence, but would
have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with no event of any importance, had there not ariſen a

<note place="margin">Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> Martin Luther, an
Auſtin friar, profeſſor in the univerſity of Wirtemberg, reſenting
the affront put upon his order, began to preach againſt theſe abuſes in
the ſale of indulgences; and being naturally of a fiery temper, and being
provoked by oppoſition, he proceeded even to decry indulgences themſelves;
and was thence carried, by the heat of diſpute, to queſtion the authority
of the pope, from which his adverſaries derived their chief arguments
againſt him<note n="†" place="bottom">Father Paul, Sleidan.</note>.
Still as he enlarged his reading, in order to ſupport theſe tenets, he
diſcovered ſome new abuſe or error in the church of Rome; and finding his
opinions greedily hearkened to, he promulgated them by writing, diſcourſes,
ſermons, conferences; and daily encreaſed the number of his diſciples.
All Saxony, all Germany, all Europe were in a very little time filled with the
voice of this daring innovator; and men, rouzed from that lethargy, in which
they had ſo long ſlept, began to call in queſtion the moſt antient and
moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinions. The elector of Saxony, favourable to Luther's
doctrine, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected him from the violence of the papal juriſdiction: The
republic of Zuric even reformed their church according to the new model: Many
ſovereigns of the empire, and the imperial diet itſelf, ſhowed a
favourable diſpoſition towards it: And Luther, a man naturally inflexible,
vehement, opinionative, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come incapable, either from promiſes of
advancement, or terrors of ſeverity, to relinquiſh a ſect, of which he
was himſelf the founder, and which brought him a glory, ſuperior to all
others, the glory of dictating the religious faith and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of
multitudes.</p>
               <p>THE rumour of theſe innovations ſoon reached England; and as
there ſtill ſubſiſted in that kingdom great remains of the Lollards,
whoſe principles reſembled thoſe of Luther, the new doctrines gained
ſecretly many partizans among the laiety of all ranks and denominations.
Henry had been educated in a ſtrict at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the church of Rome, and he
bore a particular prejudice againſt Luther, who, in his writings, ſpoke
with contempt of Thomas Aquinas, the King's favourite author: He oppoſed
himſelf therefore to the progreſs of the Lutheran tenets, by all the
influence which his extenſive and almoſt abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority 
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0429000101:126"/> conferred upon him: He even undertook to combat them
with weapons not uſually employed by monarchs, eſpecially thoſe in the
flower of their age, and force of their paſſions. He wrote a book in Latin
againſt the principles of Luther; a performance, which, if allowance be made
for the ſubject and the age, does no diſcredit to his capacity. He ſent a
copy of it to Leo, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo magnificent a preſent with great
teſtimony of regard; 
<note place="margin">Henry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the title of defender of the
faith.</note> and conferred on him, the title of <hi>defender of the
faith;</hi> an appellation ſtill retained by the Kings of England. Luther,
who was in the heat of controverſy, ſoon wrote an anſwer to Henry; and
without regard to the dignity of his antagoniſt, treated him with all the
acrimony of ſtyle, to which, in the courſe of his polemics, he had ſo
long been accuſtomed. The King, by this ill uſage, was ſtill more
preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt the new doctrines; but the public, who naturally favour
the weaker party, were inclined to attribute to Luther the victory in the
diſpute<note n="‡" place="bottom">Father Paul, lib. 1.</note>. And as
the controverſy became more illuſtrious, by Henry's entering the liſts,
it drew more the attention of mankind; and the Lutheran doctrine acquired daily
new converts in every part of Europe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cauſes of the progreſs of the
reformation.</note> THE quick and ſurprizing progreſs of this bold ſect
may juſtly in part be aſcribed to the late invention of printing, and
revival of learning: Not that reaſon bore any conſiderable part, in opening
men's eyes with regard to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures of the Romiſh church: For of all
branches of literature, philoſophy had, as yet, and till long afterwards,
made the moſt inconſiderable progreſs; neither is there any inſtance
where argument has been able to free the people from that enormous load of
abſurdity, with which ſuperſtition has every where over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed them: Not
to mention, that the rapid advance of the Lutheran doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and the violence,
with which it was embraced, prove ſufficiently, that it owed not its
ſucceſs to reaſon and reflection. The art of printing and the revival of
learning forwarded its progreſs in another manner. By means of that art, the
books of Luther and his ſectaries, full of vehemence, declamation and a rude
eloquence, were propagated more quickly, and in greater numbers. The minds of
men, ſomewhat awakened from a profound ſleep of ſo many centuries, were
prepared for every novelty, and ſcrupled leſs to tread in any unuſual
path, which was opened to them. And as copies of the ſcriptures and other
antient monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the chriſtian faith became more common, men perceived
the innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were introduced after the firſt centuries; and though
argument and reaſoning could not give conviction, an hiſtorical fact, well
ſupported, was able to make impreſſion on their underſtandings. Many of
the powers, indeed, aſſumed by the church of Rome, were very antient, and
were prior to almoſt every <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0429000101:127"/> political government
eſtabliſhed in Europe: But as the eccleſiaſtics would not ſubmit to
poſſeſs their privileges as matters of civil right, which time could
ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der valid, but appealed ſtill to a divine origin, men were tempted to
look into their primitive charter; and they could, without much difficulty,
perceive its defect in truth and authenticity.</p>
               <p>IN order to beſtow on this topic the greater influence, Luther
and his followers, not ſatisfied with oppoſing the pretended divinity of
the Romiſh church, and diſplaying the temporal inconveniencies of that
eſtabliſhment, carried matters much farther, and treated the religion of
their anceſtors, as abominable, deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, damnable; foretold by ſacred
writ itſelf as the ſource of all wickedneſs and pollution. They
denominated the pope antichriſt, called his communion the ſcarlet whore,
and gave to Rome the appellation of Babylon; expreſſions, which, however
applied, were to be found in ſcripture, and which were better calculated to
operate on the multitude than the moſt ſolid arguments. Excited by
conteſt and perſecution on the one hand, by ſucceſs and applauſe on
the other, many of the reformers carried their oppoſition to the greateſt
extremity againſt the church of Rome; and in contradiction to the multiplied
ſuperſtitions, with which that communion was loaded, they adopted an
enthuſiaſtic ſtrain of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which admitted of no obſervances,
rites or ceremonies, but placed all merit in a myſterious ſpecies of faith,
in inward viſion, rapture, and extacy. The new ſectaries, ſeized with
this ſpirit, were indefatigable in the propagation of their doctrine, and
ſet at defiance all the anathemas and puniſhments, with which the Roman
pontiff endeavoured to overwhelm them.</p>
               <p>THAT the civil power, however, might afford them protection
againſt the eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction, the Lutherans advanced
doctrines favourable, in ſome reſpects, to the temporal authority of
ſovereigns. They inveighed againſt the abuſes of the court of Rome, with
which men were at that time generally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented; and exhorted princes to
reinſtate themſelves in thoſe powers, of which the incroaching ſpirit
of the eccleſiaſtics, and eſpecially of the ſovereign pontiff, had ſo
long bereaved them. They condemned celibacy and monaſtic vows, and thereby
opened the doors of the convents to thoſe who were either tired of the
obedience and chaſtity, or diſguſted with the licence, in which they had
hitherto lived. They blamed the exceſſive riches, the idleneſs, the
libertin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm of the clergy; and pointed out their treaſures and revenues as
lawful ſpoil to the firſt invader. And as the eccleſiaſtics had
hitherto conducted a willing and a ſtupid audience, and were totally
unacquainted with controverſy, and even every ſpecies of literature; they
were unable to defend themſelves againſt men, armed with authorities,
citations, and popular topics, and qualified to triumph in every 
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0429000101:128"/> altercation or debate. Such were the advantages, with
which the reformers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their attack of the Roman hierarchy; and ſuch were
the cauſes of their rapid and aſtoniſhing ſucceſs.</p>

men.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Invaſion of France.</note> THE French had
made it a maxim in all their wars with the Engliſh, ſince the reign of
Charles the fifth, never, without great neceſſity, to hazard a general
engagement; and the duke of Vendome, who commanded the French army, now
embraced this wiſe policy. He ſupplied the towns moſt expoſed,
eſpecially Boulogne, Montreuil, Teroüenne, Hedin, with ſtrong
garriſons and plenty of proviſions: He himſelf took poſt at Abbeville,
with ſome Swiſs and French in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, and a body of cavalry: The count of
Guiſe encamped under Montreuil with ſix thouſand men. Theſe two bodies
were in a ſituation to join upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; to throw ſuccour into any
town, that was threatened; and to harraſs the Engliſh in every movement.
Surrey, who was not ſupplied with magazines, firſt divided his army for the
convenience of ſubliſting them; but finding that his quarters were every
moment beaten up by the activity of the French gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, he drew together the
forces, and laid ſiege to Hedin. But neither did he ſucceed in this
enterprize. The garriſon made vigorous ſallies upon his army: The French
forces aſſaulted them from without: Great rains fell: Fatigue and bad
weather threw the ſoldiers into dyſenteries: And Surrey was obliged to
raiſe the ſiege, and put his troops into winter quarters about the end of
October. His rear guard was attacked at Pas in Artois; and five or ſix
hundred men were cut off; nor could all his efforts make him maſter of one
place within the French frontier.</p>
               <p>THE allies were more ſucceſsful in Italy. Lautrec, who
commanded the French, loſt a bloody battle at Bicocca near Milan; and was
obliged to retire with the remains of his army. This misfortune, which
proceeded from Francis's negligence in not ſupplying Lautrec with money<note n="*" place="bottom">Guicciardini, lib. 14.</note>, was followed by the loſs of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0429000101:130"/> Genoa. The caſtle of Cremona was the ſole fortreſs
in Italy, which remained in the hands of the French.</p>
               <p>EUROPE was now in ſuch a ſituation, and ſo connected by
alliances and intereſt, that it was almoſt impoſſible for war to be
kindled in one part, and not diffuſe itſelf thro' the whole: But of all the
leagues among kingdoms, the cloſeſt was that which had ſo long
ſubſiſted between France and Scotland; and the Engliſh, while at war
with the former nation, could not expect to remain long unmoleſted on the
northern frontier.

a confederacy with England. They ſaid, that the intereſts of Scotland had
too long been ſacrificed to thoſe of the French nation, who, whenever they
found themſelves reduced to difficulties, called for the aſſiſtance of
their allies, but were ready to abandon them, ſo ſoon as they found their
advantage in making peace with England: That where a ſmall ſtate entered
into ſo cloſe a confederacy with a greater, it muſt always expect this
treatment, as a conſequence of the unequal alliance; but that there were
peculiar circumſtances in the ſituation of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, which, in the
preſent caſe, rendered it inevitable: That France was ſo diſtant and
ſo divided from them by ſeas, that ſhe ſcarce could by any means, and
never could in time, ſend ſuccours to the Scotch, ſufficient to protect
them againſt ravages from the neighbouring kingdom: That nature had, in a
manner, framed an alliance between the two Britiſh nations; having encloſed
them in the ſame iſland; given them the ſame manners, language, laws, and
form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and prepared every thing for an intimate union between
them: And that, if national antipathies were aboliſhed, which would ſoon be
the effect of peace, theſe two kingdoms, ſecured by the ocean and by their
domeſtic force, could ſet at defiance all foreign enemies, and remain for
ever ſecure and unmoleſted.</p>
               <p>THE partizans of the French alliance ſaid, on the other hand,
that the very reaſons, which were urged in favour of a league with England,
the cloſe neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the kingdom and its ſuperior force, were the
real cauſes, why a ſincere and durable confederacy could never be framed
with that hoſtile nation: That among neighbouring ſtates, occaſions of
quarrel were frequent; and the more powerful people would be ſure to ſeize
every frivolous pretence for oppreſſing the weaker, and reducing them to
ſubjection: That as the near neighbourhood of France and England had kindled
a war almoſt perpetual between them, it was the intereſt of the Scotch, if
they wiſhed to maintain their independancy, to preſerve their league with
the former kingdom, which balanced the force of the latter: That if they
deſerted that old and ſalutary alliance, on which their importance in
Europe chiefly depended, their antient enemies, ſtimulated both by intereſt
and by paſſion, would ſoon invade them with ſuperior force, and reduce
them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: Or if they delayed the attack, the inſidious peace, by
making the Scotch loſe the uſe of arms, would only prepare the way for a
ſlavery more certain and more irretrieveable<note n="*" place="bottom">Buchannan, lib. 14.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE arguments employed by the French party, being ſeconded by
the natural prejudices of the people, ſeemed rather to prevail: And when the
regent himſelf, who had been long detained beyond his appointed time by the
terror of the Engliſh <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0429000101:132"/> fleet, at laſt appeared among
them, he was able to throw the balance entirely on that ſide. By the
authority of the convention of ſtates, he aſſembled an army, with a view
of avenging the ravages committed by the Engliſh in the beginning of the
campaign; and he led them ſouthwards towards the borders. But when they were
paſſing the Tweed at the bridge of Melroſs, the Engliſh party were
again able to raiſe ſuch oppoſition, that Albany thought proper to make a
retreat. He marched downwards, along the banks of the Tweed, keeping that river
on his right; and fixed his camp oppoſite to Werk-Caſtle, which Surrey had
lately repaired. He ſent over ſome troops to beſiege that fortreſs, who
made a breach in it, and ſtormed ſome of the outworks: But the regent,
hearing of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of an Engliſh army, and diſcouraged by the
advanced ſeaſon, thought proper to diſband his forces and retire to
Edinburgh. Soon after he went over to France, and never again returned to
Scotland. The Scotch nation, agitated by their domeſtic factions, were not,
during ſeveral years, in a condition to give any more diſturbance to
England; and Henry had full leiſure to proſecute his deſigns on the
continent.</p>
               <p>THE reaſon, why the war againſt France proceeded ſo
ſlowly on the part of England was the want of money. All Henry the
ſeventh's treaſures were long ſince diſſipated; the King's habits of
expence ſtill remained; and his revenues were unequal even to the ordinary
ſupport of his government, much more to his military enterprizes. He had
laſt year cauſed a general ſurvey to be made of the kingdom; the numbers
of men, their years, profeſſion, ſtock, revenue<note n="*" place="bottom">Herbert. Stowe, 514.</note>; and expreſſed great
ſatisfaction on finding the nation ſo opulent. He then iſſued out privy
ſeals to the moſt wealthy, demanding loans of particular ſums; and this
act of power, tho' ſomewhat irregular and tyrannical, had been formerly
practiſed by the Kings of England; and the people were now familiarized to
it. But Henry carried his authority much farther on this occaſion. He
iſſued an edict for a general tax upon his ſubjects, which he ſtill
called a loan; and he levied five ſhillings in the pound from the clergy, two
ſhillings from the laity. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended loan, as being more regular, was
really more dangerous to the liberties of the people; and was a precedent for
the King's impoſing taxes without conſent of Parliament.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0429000101:133"/> the convocation; in hopes, that their example would
influence the Parliament to grant a large ſupply. He demanded a moiety of
their eccleſiaſtical revenues to be levied in five years, or two
ſhillings in the pound during that time, and tho' he met with oppoſition,
he reprimanded ſo ſeverely the refractory members, that his requeſt was
at laſt complied with. The cardinal afterwards, attended by ſeveral of the
nobility and prelates, came to the houſe of commons; and in a long and
elaborate ſpeech laid before them the public neceſſities, the dangers of
an invaſion from Scotland, the affronts received from France, the league in

according to the diviſion propoſed. So large a grant was unuſual from the

payments; the former into four yearly payments, and was not therefore at the
outmoſt above ſix-pence in the pound. The grant of the commons was but the
moiety of the ſum demanded; and the cardinal, therefore, much mortified with
the diſappointment, came again to the houſe, and deſired to reaſon with
ſuch as refuſed to comply with the King's requeſt. He was told, that it
was a rule of the houſe never to reaſon but among themſelves; and his
deſire was rejected. The commons, however, enlarged a little their former
grant, and voted an impoſition of three ſhillings in the pound on all
poſſeſſed of fifty pounds a year, and upwards<note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſaid, that when Henry heard that the commons made a great

commons diſcover evidently the humour of the times: They were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
tenacious of their money, and refuſed a demand of the crown, which was far
from unreaſonable; but they allowed an encroachment on national privileges to
paſs uncenſured, tho' its direct tendency was to ſubvert entirely the
liberties of the people. The King was ſo diſſatisfied with this ſaving
diſpoſition of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that, as he had not called a Parliament during
ſeven years before, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſeven more to elapſe, before he
ſummoned another. And under pretence of neceſſity, he levied, in one
year, from all who were worth forty pounds, what the parliament had granted him
payable in four years<note n="†" place="bottom">Speed. Hall.

irregularities were commonly aſcribed to the cardinal's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, who,
truſting to the protection, afforded him by his eccleſiaſtical character,
was leſs ſcrupulous in his encroachments on the civil rights of the
nation.</p>
               <p>THAT ambitious prelate received this year a new diſappointment
in his aſpiring views. The pope, Adrian the ſixth, died; and Clement the
ſeventh, of the family of Medici, was elected in his place, by the
concurrence of the imperial party. Wolſey began now to perceive the
inſincerity of the emperor, and concluded that that prince would never
ſecond his pretenſions to the papal chair. This injury was highly
reſented by the cardinal; and he began thenceforth to eſtrange him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from the imperial court, and to pave the way for an union between his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and the French King. Meanwhile, he diſſembled his reſentment; and after
congratulating the new pope on his promotion, applied for a continuation of the
legantine powers, which the two former popes had conferred upon him. Clement,
knowing the importance of gaining his friendſhip, granted him a
commiſſion for life; and by this unuſual conceſſion, he in a manner
transferred to him the whole papal authority in England. In ſome particulars,
Wolſey made a good uſe of this extenſive power. He erected two colleges,
one at Oxford, another at Ipſwich, the place of his nativity: He ſought,
all over Europe, for learned men to ſupply the chairs of theſe colleges:
And in order to beſtow endowments on them, he ſuppreſſed ſome
ſmaller monaſteries, and diſtributed the monks into other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents. The
execution of this project became the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that ſhe over-abounded in monks, and that ſhe wanted ſome ſupply of

               <p>THE conſederacy againſt France ſeemed more formidable than
ever, on the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this campaign<note n="*" place="bottom">Guicciardin, lib
14.</note>. Adrian, before his death, had renewed the league with Charles and
Henry. The Venetians had been induced to deſert the French alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and to
form engagements for the ſecuring Sforza in poſſeſſion of the
Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe. <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0429000101:135"/> The Florentines, the dukes of Ferrara and
Mantua, and all the powers of Italy combined in the ſame meaſure. The
emperor in perſon menaced France with a powerful invaſion on the ſide of
Guienne: The forces of England and the Netherlands ſeemed ready to break into
Picardy: A numerous body of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans were preparing to ravage Burgundy: But all
theſe perils from foreign ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were leſs threatening than a domeſtic
conſpiracy, which had been forming, and which was now come to full maturity
againſt the French monarch.</p>
               <p>CHARLES duke of Bourbon, conſtable of France, was a prince of
the moſt ſhining merit; and, beſide diſtinguiſhing himſelf in many
military enterprizes, he was adorned with every accompliſhment, which became
a perſon of his high ſtation. His virtues, embelliſhed with the graces of
youth, had made ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on Louiſe of Savoy, Francis's mother,
that, without regard to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of their years, ſhe made him
propoſals of marriage; and meeting with a refuſal, ſhe formed ſchemes
of unrelenting vengeance againſt him. She was a woman, falſe, deceitful,
vindictive, malicious; but, unhappily for France, had by her capacity, which
was conſiderable, acquired an abſolute aſcendant over her ſon. By her
inſtigation, Francis put many affronts on the conſtable, which it was
difficult for a gallant ſpirit to endure; and at laſt he permitted Louiſe
to proſecute a lawſuit againſt him, by which, under the moſt frivolous
pretences, he was deprived of his ample poſſeſſions; and inevitable
ruin was brought upon him.</p>
               <p>BOURBON, provoked at all theſe indignities, and thinking,
that, if any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries could juſtify a man in rebelling againſt his prince
and country, he muſt ſtand acquitted, had entered into a ſecret
correſpondence with the emperor and the King of England<note n="*" place="bottom">Memoires du Bellay, liv. 2.</note>. Francis, pertinacious in his
deſign of recovering the the Milaneſe, had propoſed to lead his army in
perſon into Italy; and Bourbon, who feigned ſickneſs, in order to have a
pretence for ſtaying behind, intended, ſo ſoon as the King had paſſed
the Alps, to raiſe an inſurrection among his nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous vaſſals, by whom
he was extremely beloved, and to introduce foreign enemies into the heart of
the kingdom. Francis got intimation of his deſign; but not being prompt
enough in ſecuring ſo dangerous a foe, the conſtable made his
eſcape<note n="†" place="bottom">Belcarius, lib. 17.</note>; and putting
himſelf in the emperor's ſervice, did all the injuries to his native
country, which his enterprizing ſpirit and his great talents for war enabled
him to perform. Charles profeſſed ſuch regard for him, that he promiſed
him his ſiſter in marriage, Eleonora, widow to Emanuel, King of Portugal;
and when the conſtable came to Madrid, ſome time after, the emperor
received him with all the demonſtrations of friendſhip. He ſaid to a
Spaniſh grandee, that he muſt <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0429000101:136"/> deſire him, while
Bourbon reſided in that city, to allow him to take up his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence in his
houſe, as moſt ſuitable to his rank and quality. The nobleman replied,
with a Caſtilian dignity, that his majeſty's deſire was to him a
ſufficient reaſon; but he muſt tell him beforehand, that ſo ſoon as
Bourbon departed he would raze to the ground the houſe which had been
polluted by the preſence of ſuch a traitor<note n="*" place="bottom">Gulcciardini</note>.</p>
               <p>THE King of England, deſirous that Francis ſhould undertake
his Italian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, did not openly threaten Picardy this year with an
invaſion; 
<note place="margin">24th Auguſt.</note> and it was late before
the duke of Suffolk, who commanded the Engliſh forces, paſſed over to
Calais. He was attended with the lords Montacute, Herbert, Ferrars, Morney,
Sandys, Berkeley, Powis, and many other noblemen and gentlemen<note n="†" place="bottom">Herbert.</note>. The Engliſh army, reinforced by
ſome troops, drawn from the garriſon of Calais, amounted to about 12,000
men; 
<note place="margin">Invaſion of France.</note> and having joined
an equal number of Flemings under the count of Buren, they prepared for an
invaſion of France. The ſiege of Boulogne was firſt propoſed; but that
enterprize appearing difficult, it was thought more adviſeable to leave this
town behind them. The frontier of Picardy was very ill provided of troops; and
the only defence of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince was the activity of the French officers, who
infeſted the allied army in their march, and threw garriſons, with great
expedition, into every town, which was threatened by them. After coaſting the
Somme, and paſſing Hedin, Montreuil, Dourlens, the Engliſh and Flemings
preſented themſelves before Bray, a place of ſmall force, which commanded
a bridge over the Somme. Here they were reſolved to paſs, and, if
poſſible, to take up winter quarters in France; but Crequi threw himſelf
into the town, and ſeemed determined to defend it. The allies attacked him
with vigour and ſucceſs; and when he retreated over the bridge, they
purſued him ſo hotly, that they allowed him not time to break it down, but
paſſed it along with him, and put him to route. They next advanced to
Montdidier, which they beſieged and took by capitulation. Meeting with no
oppoſition, they proceeded to the river Oiſe, within eleven leagues of
Paris, and threw that city into great conſternation; till the duke of Vendome
haſtened with ſome forces to its relief. The confederates, then, afraid of
being ſurrounded, and reduced to extremities during ſo advanced a
ſeaſon, thought proper to retire. Montdidier was abandoned: And the
Engliſh and Flemings went each into their own country.</p>
               <p>FRANCE defended herſelf from the other invaſions with equal
facility and equal good ſo tune. Twelve thouſand Lanſquenets broke into
Burgundy under the command of the count of Fuſtemberg. The count of Guiſe,
who defended <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0429000101:137"/> that frontier, had nothing to oppoſe to
them but ſome militia, and about nine hundred heavy-armed cavalry. He threw
the militia into the garriſon-towns; and with his cavalry, he kept the field,
and ſo harraſſed the Germans, that they were glad to make their retreat
into Lorraine. Guiſe attacked them as they paſſed the Meuſe, put them
into diſorder, and cut off the greateſt part of their rear.</p>
               <p>THE emperor made great preparations on the ſide of Navarre;
and, tho' that frontier was well guarded by nature, it ſeemed now expoſed
to great danger from this powerful invaſion which threatened it. Charles
beſieged Fontarabia, which had fallen a few years before into Francis's
hands; and when he had drawn thither Lautrec, the French general, he raiſed
the ſiege of a ſudden, and ſat down before Bayonne. Lautrec, aware of
that ſtratagem, made a ſudden march and threw himſelf into Bayonne, which
he defended with ſuch vigour and courage, that the Spaniards were
conſtrained to raiſe the ſiege. The emperor would have been totally
unfortunate on this ſide, had he not turned back upon Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarabia, and,
contrary to the advice of all his generals, ſat down, in the winter
ſeaſon, before that city, well fortified and ſtrongly garriſoned. The
cowardice or miſconduct of the governor ſaved him the ſhame of a new
diſappointment. The place was ſurrendered in a few days; and the emperor,
having finiſhed this enterprize, put his troops into winter quarters.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Italian wars.</note> SO obſtinate was
Francis in proſecuting his Italian expedition, that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
theſe dangerous invaſions, with which his kingdom was menaced on every
ſide, he had determined to lead in perſon a powerful army to the conqueſt
of Milan. The intelligence of Bourbon's revolt and eſcape ſtopped him at
Lyons; and fearing ſome inſurrection in the kingdom from the intrigues of a
man ſo powerful and ſo beloved, he thought it prudent to remain in France;
and to ſend for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his army, under the command of admiral Bonnivet. The
dutchy of Milan had been purpoſely left in a condition ſomewhat
defenceleſs, with a view of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring Francis to attack it; and no ſooner
had Bonnivet paſſed the Teſin, than the army of the league, and even
Proſper Colonna, who commanded it, a very prudent general, were in the
utmoſt confuſion. It is agreed, that if Bonnivet had immediately advanced
to Milan, that great city, on which the whole dutchy depends, would have opened
its gates without reſiſtance: But as he waſted his time in frivolous
enterprizes, Colonna had opporunity to reinforce the garriſon, and to put the
place in a poſture of defence. Bonnivet was now obliged to attempt reducing
the city by blockade and famine; and he took poſſeſſion of all the
poſts, which commanded the paſſages to it. But the army of the league,
mean-while, was not inactive; and they ſo ſtraitened and harraſſed the
quarters of the French, that it ſeemed more likely the latter would
themſelves periſh by famine, than <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0429000101:138"/>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1524</label> reduce the city to that extremity. Sickneſs
and fatigue and want had waſted them to ſuch a degree, that they were ready
to raiſe the blockade; and their only hopes conſiſted in a great body of
Swiſs, which was levied for the ſervice of the French king, and whoſe
arrival was every day expected.</p>
               <p>THE Swiſs had in that age ſo great a ſuperiority in the
field above almoſt every other nation, and had been ſo much courted by all
the great potentates of Europe, that they were become extremely capricious and
haughty, and thought that the fate of kingdoms depended entirely on their
aſſiſtance or oppoſition. Francis had promiſed to this body of
mercenaries, whom he had hired to join Bonnivet, that ſo ſoon as they
arrived in the plains of Piedmont, the duke of Longueville ſhould join them
with four hundred lances, and conduct them to the French camp: But by ſome
accident Longueville's march had been retarded, and the Swiſs had been
obliged to march, without the honour of being eſcorted by him. Offended at
this neglect, as they interpreted it, they no ſooner came within ſight of
the French camp, than they ſtopped, and inſtead of joining Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivet, they
ſent orders to a great body of their countrymen, who then ſerved under him,
immediately to begin their march, and to return home in their company<note n="*" place="bottom">Guicciardini, lib. 15. Memoires du Bellay, liv.
2.</note>.</p>
               <p>AFTER this deſertion of the Swiſs, Bonnivet had no other
choice, than that of making his retreat, as faſt as poſſible, into
France. He accordingly put himſelf in motion for that purpoſe; but the
allies, who foreſaw this meaſure, were ready to fall upon his rear. The
French army, however, after a ſharp action, made good their retreat, tho' not
without conſiderable loſs both in officers and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men. Among the
reſt, fell in this action the brave chevalier Bayard, eſteemed in that age
the model of ſoldiers and men of honour, and denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the <hi>knight
without fear and without reproach.</hi> When this gallant gentleman felt his
wounds to be mortal, and could no longer ſupport himſelf on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
he ordered his attendants to ſet him under a tree, and turn his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the enemy, that he might die in that poſture. The generals of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and among the reſt the duke of Bourbon, came about him, and expreſſed
their concern for his preſent condition. 
<q rend="inline">"Pity not me," cried he to Bourbon; "I die in
the diſcharge of my duty: They are to be pitied alone, who fight againſt
their prince and country<note n="†" place="bottom">Pere Daniel, vol. 3. p.

               </p>
               <p>THE French being thus expelled Italy, the pope, the Venetians,
the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines were ſatisfied with the advantage obtained over them, and
were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to proſecute their victory no farther. All theſe powers,
eſpecially Clement, had entertained a violent jealouſy of the emperor's
ambition; and <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0429000101:139"/> their jealouſy was extremely augmented,
when they ſaw him refuſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture of Milan, a fief of the empire,
to Francis Sforza, whoſe title he had acknowledged, and whoſe defence he
had embraced<note n="*" place="bottom">Guicciardini, lib. 15.</note>. They all
concluded, that he intended to put himſelf in poſſeſſion of that
important dutchy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Italy to ſubjection: Clement in particular,
actuated by this jealouſy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far in oppoſition to the
emperor, that he ſent orders to his nuncio at London to mediate a
reconciliation between France and England. But affairs were not yet fully ripe
for this change. Wolſey, diſguſted with the emperor, but ſtill more
actuated by vain-glory, was determined, that he himſelf ſhould have the
renown of bringing about that great alteration; and he engaged the King to
reject the pope's mediation. A new treaty was even concluded between Henry and
Charles for the invaſion of France. Charles ſtipulated to ſupply the duke
of Bourbon with a powerful army, in order to conquer Provence and Dauphiny:
Henry agreed to pay him a hundred thouſand crowns for the firſt month;
after which, he might either chuſe to continue the ſame monthly pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or invade Picardy with a powerful army. Bourbon was to poſſeſs theſe
provinces with the title of King; but to hold them in fief of Henry as King of
France. The dutchy of Burgundy was to be given to Charles: The reſt of the
Kingdom to Henry.</p>
               <p>THIS chimerical partition immediately failed of execution in the
article, which was moſt eaſily performed: Bourbon refuſed to acknowledge
Henry as King of France. His enterprize, however, againſt Provence ſtill
took place. A nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous army of imperialiſts invaded that country under his
command and that of the marquis of Peſcara. They laid ſiege to
Marſeilles, which, being weakly garriſoned, they expected to carry in a
little time: But the burgeſſes defended themſelves with ſuch valour and
obſtinacy, that Bourbon and Peſcara, who heard of the French King's
approach with a numerous army, found themſelves under a neceſſity of
raiſing the ſiege; and they led their forces, much weakened, baffled, and
diſheartened, into Italy.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS might now have enjoyed in ſafety the glory of
repulſing all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in every attempt which they had hitherto made of
breaking into his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: But as he received intelligence, that the King of
England, diſcouraged with his former fruitleſs enterprizes, and
diſguſted with the emperor, was mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no preparations for the invaſion
of Picardy, his antient ardour ſeized him for the conqueſt of Milan; and,
notwithſtanding the advanced ſeaſon, he was immediately determined,
contrary to the advice of his wiſeſt counſellors, to lead his army into
Italy.</p>

paſſed the Alps at Mount Cenis, and no ſooner appeared in Piedmont, than
he threw the whole Milaneſe into conſternation. There was no army in the
field able to oppoſe him; and Milan itſelf, tho' affectionate to its duke,
was not in the ſame poſture of defence as laſt year, when blockaded by
admiral Bonnivet. It was almoſt wholly deſtitute of inhabitants: Great
numbers had died of the plague; and the reſt had fled into the country for
ſafety. Francis immediately marched to that city, which opened its gates to
receive him. The forces of the emperor and Sforza fled to Lodi; and had Francis
been ſo fortunate as to purſue them, they had abandoned that place, and had
been totally diſſipated<note n="*" place="bottom">Guicciardin, lib. 15. Du
Bellay, lib. 2.</note>. But his ill fate led him to beſiege Pavia, a town of
conſiderable ſtrength, well-garriſoned, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by Leyva, one of
the braveſt officers in the Spaniſh ſervice. Every at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, which the
French king made to gain this important place, proved fruitleſs. He battered
the walls, and made breaches; but by the vigilance of Leyva, new retrenchments
were inſtantly thrown up behind the breaches: He attempted to divert the
courſe of the Teſin, which ran by one ſide of the city, and defended it;
but an inundation of the river deſtroyed in one night all the mounds which
the ſoldiers, during a long time, and with infinite pains, had been erecting.
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue and the bad ſeaſon (for it was now the depth of winter) had
waſted the French army. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1525</label> And the more to
diminiſh its force, Francis, at the pope's ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation, who now
declared, almoſt openly, for him, had detached a conſiderable body, under
the duke of Albany, to invade the kingdom of Naples. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial generals
mean while were not idle. Peſcara and Lannoy, viceroy of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, gathered
forces from all quarters. Bourbon, having pawned his jewels for money, went
into Germany, and by his perſonal intereſt, levied twelve thouſand
Lanſquenets, with which he joined the imperialiſts. This army was advancing
to raiſe the ſiege of Pavia; and the danger to the French became every day
more imminent.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of Europe was ſuch, during that age, that, partly
from the want of commerce and induſtry every where, except in Italy and the
Low Countries, partly from the extenſive privileges ſtill poſſeſſed
by the people in all the great monarchies, and their frugal maxims in granting
money, the revenues of the princes were extremely narrow, and even the ſmall
armies, which they kept on foot, could not be regularly paid by them. The
imperial forces, commanded by Bourbon, Peſcara, and Lannoy, exceeded not
twenty thouſand men; they were the only body of troops maintained by the
emperor (for he had not been able to levy any army for the invaſion of
France, either on the ſide of Spain or <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0429000101:141"/> Flanders). Yet
ſo poor was that mighty monarch, that he could tranſmit no money for the
payment of this army; and it was chiefly the hopes of ſharing the plunder of
the French camp, which had made them advance, and kept them to their
ſtandards. Had Francis raiſed the ſiege before their approach, and
retired to Milan, they muſt immediately have diſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

without danger or bloodſhed. But it was the character of this monarch, to
become obſtinate in proportion to the difficulties which he encountered; and
having once ſaid, that he would take Pavia or periſh before it, he was
reſolved rather to endure the utmoſt extremities than depart from this
reſolution.</p>

ſeveral days, at laſt gave a general aſſault, and broke into the

Almoſt the whole army, full of nobility and brave officers, either periſhed
by the ſword, or were drowned in the river. The few, who eſcaped with their
lives, fell into the hands of the enemy. The imperial generals had ſo little

apprehenſive left the Lanſquenets ſhould ſeize Francis as ſecurity
for the pay due to them, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately removed him from the camp, and ſent him

real, would have done him great honour. Inſtead of rejoicing, he
expreſſed ſympathy with Francis's ill fortune, and diſcovered his

Madrid permiſſion to make any public ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of triumph; and
ſaid that he reſerved all his exultation till he ſhould be able to obtain
ſome victory over the infidels. He ſent orders to his frontier garriſons
to commit to hoſtilities upon France. He ſpoke of concluding immediately a
peace on reaſonable terms. But all this ſeeming equity was only
hypocriſy, ſo much the more dangerous, that it was profound. And his ſole
occupation was <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0429000101:142"/> the forming ſchemes, how, from this
great incident, he might draw the utmoſt advantage, and gratify that
exorbitant ambition, by which, in all his actions, he was wholly governed.</p>
               <p>THE ſame Pennaloſa, in paſſing thro' France, carried
alſo a letter from Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis to his mother, whom he had left regent, and who
then reſided at Lyons. It contained only theſe few words, <hi>Madam, all is
loſt, except our honour.</hi> The princeſs was ſtruck with the
greatneſs of the calamity. She ſaw the kingdom without a ſovereign,
without an army, without generals, without money; ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded on every hand
by implacable and victorious enemies: And her ſole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource, in her
preſent diſtreſſes, was the hope, which ſhe entertained, of peace and
even of aſſiſtance from the King of England.</p>
               <p>HAD the King entered into the war againſt France from any
concerted political views, it is evident, that the victory of Pavia, and the
captivity of Francis, were the moſt fortunate incidents which could have
befallen him, and the only ones which could render his ſchemes effectual.
While the war was carried on in the former feeble manner, without any
deciſive advantage, he might have been able to poſſeſs himſelf of
ſome frontier towns, or perhaps of a ſmall territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which he could not
keep poſſeſſion of, without expending much more than its value. By
ſome great calamity alone, which annihilated the power of France, could he
hope to acquire the dominion of conſiderable provinces, or diſmember that
mighty monarchy, ſo affectionate to its own government and its own
ſovereigns. But as it is probable, that Henry had never before carried his
reflections ſo far; he was ſtartled at this important event, and became
ſenſible of his own danger, as well as that of all Europe, from the loſs
of a proper counterpoiſe to the great power of Charles. 
<note place="margin">Henry em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance of
France.</note> Inſtead of taking advantage, therefore, of the
diſtreſſed condition of France, he was determined to lend her his
aſſiſtance in her preſent calamities; and as the glory of generoſity,
in raiſing a fallen enemy, concurred with his political intereſts, he
heſitated the leſs in embracing theſe new meaſures.</p>
               <p>SOME diſguſts alſo had previouſly taken place between
Charles and Henry, and ſtill more between Charles and Wolſey; and that
powerful miniſter waited only a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opportunity of revenging the
diſappointments, which he had met with. The behaviour of Charles, immediately
after the victory of Pavia, gave him occaſion to revive the King's jealouſy
and ſuſpicions of his ally. The emperor ſupported ſo ill the appearance
of moderation, which he at firſt aſſumed, that he had already changed his
uſual ſtile to Henry; and inſtead of writing to him with his own hand,
and ſubſcribing himſelf <hi>your affectionate ſon and couſin;</hi> he
dictated his letters to his ſecretary, and ſimply ſubſcribed himſelf
<hi>Charles</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Guicciardin, lib. 16.</note>.
Wolſey alſo <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0429000101:143"/> perceived a diminution in the
careſſes and profeſſions, with which the emperor's letters to him were
uſually loaded, and this laſt imprudence, proceeding from the intoxication
of ſucceſs, was probably more dangerous to Charles's intereſts than the
other.</p>
               <p>HENRY, tho' determined to embrace new meaſures, was careful to
ſave appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances in the change; and he cauſed rejoicings to be every where
made on account of the victory of Pavia, and the captivity of Francis. He
publicly diſmiſſed a French envoy, whom he had formerly allowed,
notwithſtanding the war, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide at London<note n="‡" place="bottom">Du Bellay, Liv. 3. Stow. p. 221. Baker, p. 273.</note>: But upon
the regent's ſubmiſſive applications to him, he again opened a
correſpondence with her; and beſides aſſuring her of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and protection, he exacted a promiſe, that ſhe never would conſent to the
diſmembering any province of the monarchy for her ſon's ranſom. With the
emperor, however, he put on the appearance of vigour and enterprize; and in
order to have a pretence for breaking with him, he diſpatched Tonſtal,
biſhop of London, to Madrid, with propoſals for a powerful invaſion of
France. He required, that Charles ſhould immediately enter Guienne at the
head of a great army, in order to put him in poſſeſſion of that
province; and he demanded the payment of large ſums of money, which that
prince had borrowed from him in his laſt viſit at London. He knew, that the
emperor was in no condition of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting either of theſe conditions; and
that he had as little inclination to make him maſter of ſuch conſiderable
territories upon the frontiers of Spain.</p>
               <p>TONSTAL likewiſe informed him, that Charles, on his part,
wanted not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt England; and in particular was diſpleaſed
with Henry, becauſe laſt year he had neither continued his monthly payments
to Bourbon, nor invaded Picardy, according to his ſtipulations; that,
inſtead of expreſſing his intentions to eſpouſe Mary, when ſhe
ſhould be marriageable, he had hearkened to propoſals, for marrying his
niece Iſabella, princeſs of Portugal; and that he had entered into a
ſeparate treaty with Francis, and ſeemed determined to reap alone all the
advantages of the ſucceſs, with which fortune had crowned his arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">30 Auguſt.</note> THE King, influenced by
all theſe motives, concluded at Moore his alliance with the regent, and
engaged to procure Francis his liberty on reaſonable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<note n="*" place="bottom">Du Tillet, Recucil des Traites de Leonard, tom. 2.
Herbert.</note>: The regent alſo, in another treaty, acknowledged the kingdom
to be Henry's debtor for one million eight hundred thouſand crowns, to be
diſcharged in half yearly payments of fifty thouſand crowns: After which,
Henry was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0429000101:144"/> during his own life, a yearly
penſion of a hundred thouſand crowns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his
generoſity, he could not for bear taking advantage of the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous
ſituation of France, in order to exact this lucrative condition from her. A
large preſent of a hundred thouſand crowns was alſo made Wolſey, for
his good offices, but covered under the pretence of arrears due on the
penſion grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for relinquiſhing the adminiſtration of Tournay.</p>
               <p>MEANWHILE, as Henry foreſaw, that this treaty with France
might involve him in a war with the emperor, he was alſo determined to fill
his treaſury by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions upon his own ſubjects; and as the parliament
had diſcovered ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance in complying with his demands, he followed
the advice of Wolſey, and reſolved to make uſe of his prerogative alone
for that purpoſe. He iſſued out commiſſions to all the counties of
England, for levying four ſhillings in the pound from the clergy, three
ſhillings and four pence from the laity; and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable did he deem
his authority, that he took no care to cover, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this arbitrary
exaction, even under the ſlender pretence of a loan. 
<note place="margin">Diſcontents of the Engliſh.</note> But he
ſoon found, that he had preſumed too far on the paſſive
ſubmiſſion of his ſubjects. The people, diſpleaſed with an exaction
beyond what was uſually levied in thoſe days, but ſtill more
diſguſted with the illegal method of impoſing it, broke out in murmurs,
complaints, oppoſition to the commiſſioners; and their refractory
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition even threatened a general inſurrection. Henry had the
prudence to ſtop ſhort, in that dangerous path, into which he had entered.
He ſent letters to all the counties; declaring, that he meant no force by
this laſt impoſition, and that he would take nothing of his ſubjects but
by way of <hi>benevolence.</hi> He flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, that his
condeſcenſion in employing that diſguiſe would ſatisfy the people,
and that no one would dare to render himſelf obnoxious to royal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
by refuſing any payment required of him in this manner. But the ſpirit of
oppoſition was once rouſed, and could not ſo eaſily be quieted at
pleaſure. A lawyer in the city objecting the ſtatute of Richard the third,
by which benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences were for ever aboliſhed, it was replied by the court,
that Richard being an uſurper, and his Parliaments factious aſſemblies,
his ſtatutes could not bind a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and <hi>abſolute</hi> monarch, who
held his crown by hereditary right, and needed not to court the favour of a
licentious populace<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>
                  </note>. The judges even went ſo
far as to affirm poſitively, that the King might exact by commiſſion any
ſum which he pleaſed; and the privy council gave a ready aſſent to this
decree, which anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated the moſt valuable privilege of the people, and
rendered all their other privileges precarious. Armed with ſuch formidable
authority, of royal preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and a pretext of law, Wolſey ſent for the
mayor of London, and deſired to <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0429000101:145"/> know what he was
willing to give for the ſupply of his majeſty's neceſſities. The mayor
ſeemed deſirous, before he ſhould declare himſelf, to conſult the
common council; but the cardinal required, that he and all the aldermen
ſhould ſeparately confer with himſelf about the benevolence; and he
eluded by that means the danger of formed oppoſition. Matter, however, went
not ſo ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the country. An inſurrection was begun in ſome
places; but as the people were not headed by any conſiderable perſon, it
was eaſy for the duke of Suffolk, and the earl of Surrey, now duke of
Norfolk, by employing perſuaſion and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to induce the ringleaders
to lay down their arms, and ſurrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves priſoners. The king,
finding it dangerous to puniſh criminals, engaged in ſo popular a cauſe,
was determined, notwithſtanding his violent, imperious temper, to grant them
a general pardon; and he very prudently imputed their guilt, not to their want
of loyalty or affection, but to their poverty. The offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were brought
before the ſtar-chamber; where, after a ſevere charge laid againſt them
by the King's council, the cardinal ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"That, notwithſtanding their grievous
offences, the King, in conſideration of their neceſſities, had granted
them his gracious pardon, upon condition, that they would give in ſureties
for their future good behaviour."</q> But they replying, that they had no
ſureties, the cardinal firſt, and after him the duke of Norfolk, ſaid,
that they would ſtand bound for them. Upon which they were diſcharged<note n="‡" place="bottom">Herbert, Hall, Stow, 525. Hollinſhed, p.
891.</note>.</p>
               <p>THESE arbitrary impoſitions, being generally imputed to the
cardinal's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, increaſed the general odium, under which he laboured;
and the clemency of the pardon, being aſcribed to the King, was conſidered
as an atonement on his part for the illegality of the meaſure. But Wolſey,
ſupported both by royal and papal authority, proceeded, without ſcruple, to
violate all eccleſiaſtical privileges, which, during that age, were much
more ſacred than civil; and having once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in that unuſual attempt
of ſuppreſſing ſome monaſteries, he kept all the reſt in awe, and
exerciſed over them the moſt arbitrary juriſdiction. By his
commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as legate, he was impowered to viſit them, and reform them,
and chaſtiſe their irregularities; and he employed his uſual agent,
Allen, in the exerciſe of this authority. The religious houſes were obliged
to compound for their guilt, real or pretended, by giving large ſums to the
cardinal or his deputy; and this oppreſſion was carried ſo far, that it
reached at laſt the King's ears, which were not commonly open to complaints
againſt his favourite. He reproved Wolſey in ſevere terms, which rendered
him, if not more innocent, at leaſt more cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the future. That
haughty miniſter had built a ſplendid palace at Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton court, which he
probably intended, as well as that of York place in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, 
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0429000101:146"/> miniſter, for his own uſe; but fearing the
increaſe of envy on account of this magnificence, and deſirous to appeaſe
the King, he made him a preſent of that building, and told him, that, from
the firſt, he had erected it for his ſervice.</p>
               <p>THE abſolute authority, poſſeſſed by the King,
rendered his domeſtic go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, both over his people and his miniſters,
eaſy and expeditious: The conduct of foreign affairs alone required effort
and application; and they were now brought to ſuch a paſs, that it was no
longer ſafe for England to be entirely neutral. The feigned moderation of the
emperor was of very ſhort date; and it was ſoon obvious to all the world,
that his great dominions, far from gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying his ambition, were only regarded
as the means of acquiring an empire more extenſive. The terms, propoſed by
him to his priſoner, were ſuch as muſt have for ever annihilated the
power of France, and deſtroyed the ballance of Europe. He required, that that
monarch ſhould reſtore to him the dutchy of Burgundy, uſurped, as he
pretended, by Lewis the eleventh upon his anceſtors; that he ſhould yield
Provence and Dauphiny to the duke of Bourbon, to be poſſeſſed by him in
full ſovereignty, without fief or homage to the crown of France; that he
ſhould ſatisfy the King of England with regard to the provinces, which that
prince claimed as his inheritance; and that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all title to
Naples, Milan, Genoa, or any territory in Italy<note n="*" place="bottom">Guicciardini, lib. 16.</note>.</p>
               <p>THESE demands were propoſed to Francis, ſoon after the
battle of Pavia, while he was detained in Pizzighitone; and as he had hitherto
truſted ſomewhat to the emperor's generoſity, the diſappointment
excited in his breaſt the moſt lively indignation. He ſaid, that he would
rather live and die a priſoner than agree to diſmember, his kingdom; and
that, even were he ſo baſe as to ſubmit to ſuch terms, his ſubjects
would never permit him to carry them into execution. The offers which he made
for obtaining his liberty, were, that he would renounce all claims in Italy,
that he would aſſiſt the emperor in recovering the territories uſurped
upon the empire by the Venetians, that he ſhould relinquiſh the homage due
by the emperor for Artois and Flanders, that he would marry Eleonora, the
emperor's ſiſter, (for he was now a widower) and acknowledge the dutchy of
Burgundy to be poſſeſſed as her dowry; and to be inherited by her
children<note n="†" place="bottom">De Vera Hiſt. de Charles
V.</note>.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS was encouraged to perſiſt in theſe offers, by the
favourable accounts, which he heard of Henry's diſpoſitions towards him,
and of the alarms which had ſeized all the chief powers in Italy, upon his
defeat and captivity. 
<note place="margin">Francis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to Madrid.</note> He was
uneaſy, however, to be ſo far diſtant from the emperor with whom he
muſt treat; and he deſired to be removed to Madrid, in hopes that a
perſonal interview would operate much in his favour, and that Charles, if not
influenced by his miniſters, <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0429000101:147"/> might be found
poſſeſſed of the ſame frankneſs of diſpoſition; by which he
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was diſtinguiſhed. He was ſoon convinced of his miſtake. The
emperor, under pretence of an aſſembly of the ſtates at Toledo, kept,
during ſome time, at a diſtance from him; and even after they broke up,
delayed his viſit to the captive King; feigning a del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cacy in that particular, as if his company, in the
preſent ſituation of affairs, before any terms were agreed on, would be
regarded as an inſult upon the royal priſoner. Francis, partly from want of
exerciſe, partly from reflections on his preſent melancholy ſituation,
fell into a languiſhing illneſs; which begot apprehenſions in Charles,
left the death of his captive ſhould bereave him of all thoſe advantages,
which he propoſed to extort from him. He then paid him a viſit in the
caſtle of Madrid; and as he approached the bed in which Francis was laid, the
ſick monarch called to him, 
<q rend="inline">"You come, Sir, to viſit your priſoner."</q>

                  <q rend="inline"> "No," replied the emperor, "I come to viſit
my brother, and my friend, who ſhall ſoon obtain his liberty."</q> He
ſoothed his affliction with many ſpeeches of a like nature, which had ſo
good an effect, that the King daily recovered<note n="‡" place="bottom">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

employed himſelf in concert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the miniſters of the emperor, the
terms of his treaty.</p>
               <p>WHILE this negociation advanced ſlowly, fortune threw into the
emperor's hands a new opportunity of aggrandizing his dominions in Italy.
Francis Sforza, impatient that his inveſtiture of Milan ſhould ſo long be
delayed, and that even after it was granted, it ſhould be encumbered with
many exorbitant conditions, had endeavoured to ſeduce Peſcara, the imperial
general, from his fidelity, and to engage him in a conſpiracy againſt his
maſter. Peſcara feigned to enter into the deſign; but having revealed the
whole contrivance, he received orders to take poſſeſſion of the
Milaneſe; and Charles made no ſecret of his intention to try Sforza and
forfeit his fief, on account of the treaſon, which he had committed againſt
his liege-lord and ſovereign<note n="*" place="bottom">Guicciard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ni, lib. 16.</note>. This incident
retained the Italian powers in cloſer union with France; and the emperor, by
graſping too much, found himſelf in danger of loſing all his advantages.
His apprehenſions were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, when he heard, that Francis had ſent a
reſignation of his crown to the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

reduced to the dutchy of Burgundy; and even that territory, Francis had agreed
to yield, but he ſtill inſiſted on firſt recovering his liberty. All

willing to relax of his rigour in this particular; and the treaty of Madrid was
ſigned, by which, it was hoped, an end would be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally put to the
differences between theſe two great monarchs. The principal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was
the reſtoring of Francis's liberty, and the delivery of his two eldeſt
ſons as hoſtages to the emperor for the reſtitution of Burgundy: If any
difficulty ſhould afterwards occur in the execution of this article, with
regard to Burgundy, from the oppoſition of the ſtates, either of France or
of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, Francis ſtipulated, that in ſix weeks time, he ſhould
return to his priſon, and remain there till the full performance of the
treaty. There were many other articles in this famous convention, all of them
rigorous and ſevere to the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree againſt the captive monarch; and
Charles diſcovered evidently his intention of reducing Italy, as well as
France, to ſubjection and dependence.</p>
               <p>MANY of Charles's miniſters foreſaw, that Francis, however
ſolemn the oaths, promiſes, and proteſtations exacted of him, never would
execute a treaty, which was ſo diſadvantageous, or rat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er ruinous and deſtructive, to himſelf, his
poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and his country. By putting Burgundy into the emperor's hands, he
gave his powerful enemy an entrance into the heart of the kingdom: By
ſacrificing his allies in Italy, he deprived himſelf of all foreign
aſſiſtance; and arming his oppreſſor with the whole force and riches
of that opulent country, rendered him abſolutely irreſiſtable. To theſe
great views of intereſt, were added the motives, no leſs cogent, of
paſſion and reſentment; while Francis, a prince, who piqued himſelf on
generoſity, reflected on the rigor with which he had been treated dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his
captivity, and the cruel terms which had been exacted of him for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of his freedom. It was alſo foreſeen, that the emulation and rivalſhip,
which had ſo long ſubſiſted between theſe two monarchs, would make
him feel the ſtrongeſt reluctance on yielding the ſuperiority to an
antagoniſt, who, by the whole tenor of his conduct, he would be apt to think,

prince, was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his people; and that the laws of honour,
which with a private man ought to be abſolutely ſupreme, and ſuperior to
all intereſts, were with a ſovereign ſubordinate to the great duty of
enſuring the ſafety of his country. Nor could it be imagined, that Francis

               <p>SUCH was the reaſoning of ſeveral of Charles's miniſters,
particularly of Gat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinara, his chancellor<note n="*" place="bottom">Guicciardini, lib. 16.</note>, who counſelled him to treat
Francis with more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, and to give him his liberty on ſuch terms,
as would engage him, not by the feeble band of treaties, but by the more
forcible tye of honour, to a ſtrict and faithful performance. But the
emperor's avidity prevented him from following this wiſer and more honourable
council; at the ſame time, that the proſpect of a general combination of
Europe hindered him from detaining Francis in captivity, and taking advantage
of the confuſions, which his abſence muſt neceſſarily oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion in
his kingdom. Still ſuſpicious, however, of the ſincerity of his
priſoner, he took an opportunity, before they parted, of aſking him,
privately and as a friend, whether he ſeriouſly intended to execute the
treaty of Madrid; proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that, in all caſes, he was firmly determined
to reſtore him to his liberty, and that the proſpect of obtaining this
advantage needed no longer engage him to diſſemble. Francis was too well
acquainted with Charles's character to truſt to the ſincerity of this
proteſtation; and therefore renewed his aſſurances of fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and a
ſtrict obſervance of his word. The emperor replied, that Francis was now
his beſt friend and ally; but if he ſhould afterwards break his
engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he could not ſuſpect, he ſhould think himſelf
entitled to reproach him with a conduct ſo baſe and unworthy: And on
theſe terms the two monarchs parted.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Francis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers his liberty.</note> FRANCIS,
on entering into his own dominions, delivered his two eldeſt ſons as
hoſtages into the hands of the Spaniards. He mounted a Turkiſh horſe, and
imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately putting him to the gallop, he waved his hand over his head, and
cried aloud ſeveral times, <hi>I am yet a King.</hi> He ſoon reached
Bayonne, where he was joyfully received by the regent and his whole court. He
immediately wrote to Henry; acknowledging that to his good offices alone he
owed his liberty, and proteſting, that he ſhould be entirely governed by
his councils in all tranſactions with the emperor. When the Spaniſh envoy
demanded his ratification of the treaty of Madrid, now that he had fully
recovered his liberty, he waved the propoſal; under colour, that it was
neceſſary to aſſemble previouſly the States both of France and of
Burgundy, and obtain their conſent. The States of Burgundy ſoon met; and
declaring againſt the clauſe, which contained an engagement of alienating
their province, they expreſſed their reſolution of oppoſing, even by
force of arms, the execution of ſo ruinous and unjuſt an article. The
imperial miniſter then required, that Francis, in conformity to the treaty of
Madrid, <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0429000101:150"/> ſhould now return to his priſon; 
<note place="margin">22d May.</note> but the French monarch,
inſtead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, made public the treaty, which, a little before, he
had ſecretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded at Cognac, againſt the ambitious ſchemes and
uſurpations of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror<note n="*" place="bottom">Guicciardini, lib.
17.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE pope, the Venetians, and other Italian ſtates, who were
deeply intereſted in theſe events, had been held in the moſt anxious
ſuſpence with regard to the reſolutions, which Francis ſhould take,
after the recovery of his liberty; and Clement, who ſuſpected, that that
prince would never execute a treaty ſo hurtful to his intereſts, and even
deſtructive of his independancy, had very frankly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him a
diſpenſation from all his oaths and engagements. Francis remained not in
ſuſpence; but entered immediately into the confederacy propoſed to him.
It was ſtipulated, between that King, the pope, the Venetians, the Swiſs,
the Florentines, the duke of Milan, among other articles, that they would
oblige the emperor to deliver up the two young princes of France on receiving a
ſuitable ſum of money; and that he would reſtore Milan to Sforza, without
farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions or incumbrances. The King of England was invited to accede,
not only as a contracting party, but alſo as protector of the holy league,
ſo it was called: And if Naples ſhould be conquered from the emperor, in
proſecution of this confederacy, it was agreed, that Henry ſhould enjoy a
principality of the yearly revenue of 30,000 ducats: And that cardinal
Wolſey, in conſideration of the ſervices, which he had rendered to
chriſtendom, ſhould alſo, in ſuch an event, be put in
poſſeſſion of a yearly revenue of 10,000 ducats.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS was extremely deſirous, that the appearance of this
great confederacy ſhould engage the emperor to relax ſomewhat of the
extreme rigour of the treaty of Madrid; and while he entertained theſe hopes,
he was the more remiſs in his warlike preparations, nor did he ſend in due
time reinforcements to his allies in Italy. <label type="milestone">

Bourbon had got poſſeſſion of the whole Milaneſe, of which the
emperor intended to grant him the inveſtiture; and having levied a
conſiderable army in Germany, he became formidable to all the Italian
potentates; and not the leſs ſo, that Charles, deſtitute of money, had
not been able to remit any pay to the forces. The general was extremely beloved
by his troops; and in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent thoſe mutinies which were ready to
break out every moment, and which their affection alone for him had hitherto
reſtrained, he led them to Rome, and promiſed to enrich them by the plunder
of that opulent city. 
<note place="margin">6th May.</note> He was himſelf killed, as he
was planting a ladder to ſcale the walls; 
<note place="margin">Sack of Rome.</note> but his ſoldiers,
rather enraged than diſcouraged by his death, mounted to the aſſault with
the utmoſt valour, and entering the city, ſword in hand, exerciſed all
thoſe brutalities, <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0429000101:151"/> which may be expected from ferocity
excited by reſiſtance, and from inſolence which takes place when that
reſiſtance is no more. That renowned city, expoſed by her renown alone to
ſo many calamities, never endured in any age, even from the barbarians, by
whom ſhe was often ſubdued, ſuch indignities as ſhe was now
conſtrained to ſuffer. The unreſtrained maſſacre and pillage, which
continued for ſeveral days, were the leaſt ills, to which the unhappy
Romans were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed<note n="*" place="bottom">Guicciardiani, lib. 18. Bellay.
Stowe, p. 527.</note>. Whatever was reſpectable in modeſty or ſacred in
religion ſeemed but the more to provoke the inſults of the ſoldiery.
Virgins ſuffered violation in the arms of their parents, and upon thoſe
very altars, to which they had fled for protection. Aged prelates, after
enduring every indignity, and even every torture, were thrown into dungeons,
and menaced each moment with the moſt cruel death, in order to engage them to
reveal their ſecret treaſures, or purchaſe liberty by exorbitant
ranſoms. Clement himſelf, who had truſted for protection to the
ſacredneſs of his character, and neglected to make his eſcape in time,
was taken captive, and found that his dignity, which procured him no regard
from the Spaniſh ſoldiers, did but draw on him the inſolent moquery of
the German, who, being generally attached to the Lutheran principles, were
pleaſed to gratify their animoſity by the abaſement of the ſovereign
pontiff.</p>
               <p>WHEN intelligence of this great event was conveyed to the
emperor, that young prince, habituated to hypocriſy, expreſſed the moſt
profound ſorrow for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his arms: He put himſelf and all
his court into mourning: He ſtopped the rejoicings for the birth of his ſon
Philip: And knowing that every artifice, however groſs, is able, when
ſeconded by authority, to impoſe upon the people, he ordered prayers,
during ſeveral months, to be put up in all the churches for the Pope's
liberty; an event, which, all men knew, a letter under his hand could in a
moment have procured.</p>
               <p>THE concern, expreſſed by Henry and Francis for the calamity
of their ally, was much more ſincere. Theſe two monarchs, a few days before
the ſack of Rome, had concluded a treaty<note n="†" place="bottom">30th
April.</note>at Weſtminſter, in which, beſides renewing former alliances,
they agreed to ſend ambaſſadors to Charles, requiring him to accept of
two millions of crowns as the ranſom of the French princes, and to repay the
money, borrowed of Henry; and in caſe of refuſal, the ambaſſadors,
attended with heralds, were to denounce war againſt him. This war, it was
agreed to proſecute in the Low Countries, with an army of thirty thouſand
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry and fifteen hundred men at arms, two thirds to be ſupplied by
Francis, the reſt by Henry. And in order to ſtrengthen the alliance between
the princes, it was ſtipulated, that either Francis or his ſon, the duke of
Orleans, as ſhould <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0429000101:152"/> afterwards be agreed on, ſhould
eſpouſe the princeſs Mary, Henry's daughter. 
<note place="margin">29th May.</note> No ſooner did the monarchs
receive intelligence of Bourbon's enterprize, than they changed, by a new
treaty, the ſcene of the projected war from the Netherlands to Italy; and
hearing of the pope's captivity, they were farther ſtimulated to undertake
the war with vigour for the reſtoring his liberty. Wolſey himſelf
croſſed the ſeas, in order to have an interview with Francis, and to
concert meaſures for that purpoſe; 
<note place="margin">11th July.</note> and he diſplayed all that
grandeur and magnificence, with which he was intoxicated. He was attended with
a train of a thouſand horſe. The cardinal of Lorraine, and the chancellor
Alançon, met him at Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne: Francis himſelf, beſides granting to
that haughty prelate the power of giving in every place, where he came, liberty
to all priſoners, made a journey as far as Amiens to meet him, and even
advanced ſome miles from the town, the more to honour his reception. It was
here ſtipulated, that the duke of Orleans ſhould eſpouſe the princeſs
Mary; and as the emperor ſeemed to be taking ſome ſteps towards
aſſembling a general council, the two monarchs agreed not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it, but, during the interval of the pope's captivity, to govern the churches in
their dominions, each by his own authority. Wolſey made ſome attempts to
get his legantine power extended into France, and even into Germany; but
find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his efforts fruitleſs, he was obliged, tho' with great reluctance,
to deſiſt from theſe ambitious enterprizes<note n="‡" place="bottom">Burnet, book 3. coll. 12, 13.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">18th Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> THE more to cement
the union between theſe princes, a new treaty was, ſome time after,
concluded at London; in which Henry agreed to renounce for ever all claims upon
the crown of France; claims, which might now indeed be eſteemed chimerical,
but which often ſerved as a pretence for exciting the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary Engliſh to
wage war upon the French monarchy. 
<note place="margin">League with France.</note> As a return for
this conceſſion, Francis bound himſelf and his ſucceſſors to pay
for ever fifty thouſand crowns a year to Henry and his ſucceſſors; and
that a greater ſolemnity might be given to this treaty, it was agreed, that
the Parliaments and great nobility of both kingdoms ſhould give their
conſent to it. The mareſchal Montmorency, accompanied with many perſons
of diſtinction, and attended by a pompous equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, was ſent over to
ratify the treaty; and was received at London with all the parade, which
ſuited the ſolemnity of the occaſion. The terror of the emperor's
greatneſs had entirely extinguiſhed the antient animoſity between the
nations; and Spain, during more than a century, became, tho' a more diſtant
power, the chief object of jealouſy to the Engliſh.</p>
               <p>THIS appearance of a cordial union between France and England,
tho' it added influence to the joint embaſſy which they ſent to the
emperor, was not <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0429000101:153"/> able to bend that ambitious monarch to
ſubmit entirely to the conditions inſiſted on by the allies. He departed
indeed from his demand of Burgundy as the ranſom of the French princes; but
he required, previouſly to their recovery of liberty, that Francis ſhould
evacuate Genoa, and all the fortreſſes held by him in Italy: And he
declared his intention of bringing Sforza to a trial, and confiſcating the
dutchy of Milan, on account of his pretended treaſon. The Engliſh and
French he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds, therefore, according to agreement, declared war againſt him,
and ſet him at defiance. Charles anſwered the Engliſh herald with
moderation; but to the French, he reproached his maſter with breach of faith,
remembered him of the private converſation which had paſſed between them
at Madrid before their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and offered to prove by ſingle combat,
that that monarch had acted diſhonourably. Francis retaliated this challenge
by giving Charles the lie; and, after demanding ſecurity of the field, he
offered to maintain his cauſe by ſingle combat. Many meſſages
paſſed to and fro between them; but tho' both the princes were undoubtedly
brave, the intended duel never took place. The French and Spaniards, during
that age, diſputed zealouſly which of the monarchs incurred the blame of
this failure; but all men of moderation every where la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the power of
fortune, that the prince the more candid, generous, and ſincere, ſhould, by
unhappy incidents, have been reduced to that cruel ſituation, that nothing
but the breach of his word could preſerve his people, and that he muſt ever
after, without being able to make a proper reply, bear to be reproached with
this infidelity by a rival, inferior to him both in honour and in virtue.</p>
               <p>BUT tho' this famous challenge between Charles and Francis had
no imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate conſequences with regard to theſe monarchs themſelves, it
produced a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable alteration on the manners of the age. The practice
of challenges and duels, which had been part of the antient barbarous
juriſprudence, which was ſtill preſerved on very ſolemn occaſions,
and which was even countenanced by the civil magiſtrate, began thenceforth to
prevail on the moſt trivial occaſions; and men, on any affront or injury,
thought themſelves entitled, or even required in honour, to take private
revenges on their enemies, by vindicating their right in ſingle combat.
Theſe abſurd, tho' generous maxims, ſhed much of the beſt blood in
chriſtendom during more than two centuries; and notwithſtanding the
ſeverity of law, ſuch is the prevailing force of cuſtom, they are far
from being as yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely exploded.</p>

papal authority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reformation, the marriage of Henry the eighth with
Catherine of Arragon, his brother's widow, had not paſſed, without much
ſcruple and difficulty. The prejudices of the people were in general bent
againſt a conjugal union between ſuch near relations; and the late King,
tho' he had ſolemnized the eſpouſals, when his ſon was but twelve years
of age, gave evident proofs of his intention to take afterwards a proper
opportunity of annulling them<note n="*" place="bottom">Moriſon's Apomaxis, p.
13.</note>. He ordered the young prince, ſo ſoon as he came of age, to
enter a proteſtation againſt the marriage<note n="†" place="bottom">Moriſon, p. 13. Heylin's Queen Mary, p. 2.</note>; and on his
death-bed he charged him, as his laſt injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to finiſh an
alliance, ſo unuſual and expoſed to ſuch inſuperable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.
After the King's acceſſion, ſome members of the Privy Council,
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Warham, the primate, openly declared againſt the reſolution
taken, of compleating the marriage; and tho' Henry's youth and diſſipation
kept him, during ſome time, from entertaining any ſcruples with regard to
the meaſure which he had embraced, there happened incidents, ſufficient to
rouze his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and to inform him of the ſentiments, generally
entertained on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The ſtates of Caſtile had oppoſed the
emperor, Charles's, eſpouſals with Mary, Henry's daughter; and among other
objections, had much inſiſted on the illegitimate birth of the young
princeſs<note n="‡" place="bottom">Lord Herbert, Fiddes's life of
Wolſey.</note>. And when the negotiations were afterwards opened with France,
and mention was made of betrothing her to Francis or the duke of Orleans, the
biſhop of Tarbe, the French ambaſſador, <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0429000101:155"/> revived
the ſame objection<note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer, XIV. 192, 203. Heylin, p.
3.</note>. But tho' theſe events naturally raiſed ſome doubts in Henry's
mind, there concurred other cauſes, which tended much to fortify his
remorſe, and render his conſcience more ſcrupulous.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The King en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into theſe
ſcruples.</note> THE queen was older than the King by no leſs than ſix
years; and the decay of her beauty, together with particular infirmities and
diſeaſes, had contributed, notwithſtanding her blameleſs character and
deportment, to render her perſon unacceptable to him. Tho' ſhe had borne
him ſeveral children, they all died in early infancy, except one daughter;
and he was the more ſtruck with this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, that the curſe of being
childleſs is the very threatening, contained in the Moſaical law againſt
thoſe who eſpouſe their brother's widow. The King was actuated by a
ſtrong deſire of having male iſſue: With a view to that end, it is
believed, more than from deſire towards other gratification, he had, a few
years before this period, made addreſſes to a young lady, Catherine,
daughter of Sir John Blount; and when ſhe bore him a ſon, he expreſſed
the higheſt ſatisfaction, and immediately created him duke of Richmond. The
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the crown too was a conſideration, that occurred to
every one, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the lawfulneſs of Henry's marriage was queſtioned; and
it was apprehended, that, if doubts of Mary's legitimacy concurred with the
weakneſs of her ſex, the King of Scots, the next heir, would certainly
advance his own pretenſions, and throw the kingdom into confuſion. The
evils, as yet recent, of civil wars and convulſions, ariſing from a
diſputed title, made great impreſſion on the minds of men, and rendered
the people univerſally deſirous of any event, which might obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſo
irreparable a calamity. And the King was thus impelled, both by his private
paſſions, and by motives of public intereſt, to ſeek the
diſſolution of his inauſpicious, and, as it was eſteemed, unlawful
marriage with Catherine.</p>
               <p>HENRY afterwards affirmed, that his ſcruples of conſcience
aroſe entirely from private reflection; and that on conſulting his
confeſſor, the biſhop of Lincoln, he found that prelate poſſeſſed
with the ſame doubts and difficulties. The King himſelf, being ſo great a
caſuiſt and a divine, proceeded then to examine the queſtion more
carefully by his own learning and ſtudy; and having had recourſe to Thomas
of Aquine, he obſerved that this celebrated doctor, whoſe authority was
great in the church and abſolute with him, had treated of that very caſe,
and had expreſsly declared againſt the lawfulneſs of ſuch
marriages<note n="†" place="bottom">Burnet, Fiddes.</note>. The
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, ſaid Thomas, contained in Leviticus, and among the reſt,
that of marrying a brother's widow, are moral, eternal, and founded on a divine
ſanction; and tho' the pope may diſpenſe with the rules of the church,
the laws of God cannot be ſet aſide by any authority leſs than that which
enacted them. The <pb n="151" facs="tcp:0429000101:156"/> archbiſhop of Canterbury was next
applied to; and he was required to conſult his brethren: All the prelates of
England, except Fiſher, biſhop of Rocheſter, declared unanimouſly,
under their hand and ſeal, that they deemed the King's marriage unlawful<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. 1. p. 38. Stowe, p. 548.</note>. Wolſey
alſo fortified the King's ſcruples<note n="†" place="bottom">Le Grand,
vol. 3. p. 46, 166, 168. Saunders. Heylin, p. 4.</note>, partly with a view of
promoting a total breach with the emperor, Catherine's nephew, partly
deſirous of connecting the King more cloſely with Francis, by marrying him
to the dutcheſs of Alençon, ſiſter to that monarch; and perhaps
too ſomewhat diſguſted with the queen herſelf, who had reproved him for
certain freedoms, unbefitting his character and ſtation<note n="‡" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. 1. p. 38. Strype, vol. 1. p. 88.</note>. But Henry
was carried forward, tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not at firſt excited, by a motive more
forcible than even the ſuggeſtions of that powerful favourite.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anne Boleyn.</note> ANNE Boleyn, who lately
appeared at court, had been created maid of honour to the queen; and having had
frequent opportunities of being ſeen by the King, and of converſing with
him, ſhe had acquired an entire aſcendant over his affections. This young
lady, whoſe grandeur and misfortunes have rendered her ſo celebrated, was
daughter to Sir Thomas Boleyn, who had been employed by the King in ſeveral
embaſſies, and who was allied to all the principal nobility of the kingdom.
His wife, mother to Anne, was daughter of the duke of Norfolk; his own mother
was daughter of the earl of Ormond; his grandfather Sir Geoffrey Boleyn, who
had been mayor of London, had eſpouſed one of the daughters and co-heirs of
the lord Haſtings<note n="§" place="bottom">Camden's preface to the life
of Elizabeth. Burnet, vol. 1. p. 44.</note>. Anne herſelf, tho' then in very
early youth, had been carried over to Paris by the King's ſiſter, when
ſhe eſpouſed Lewis the twelfth of France; and upon the deceaſe of that
monarch, and the return of his dowager into England, Anne, whoſe
accompliſhments even in her tender years were always much admired, was
retained in the ſervice of Claude, queen of France, ſpouſe to Francis;
and after her death, ſhe paſſed into the family of the dutcheſs of
Alançon, a princeſs of ſingular merit. The exact time, when ſhe
returned to England, is not certainly known; but it was after the King had
entertained doubts with regard to the lawfulneſs of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with
Catherine; if the account is to be credited, which he himſelf after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
gave of that tranſaction. Henry's ſcruples had made him break off all
conjugal commerce with the queen; but as he ſtill ſupported an
intercourſe of civility and freindſhip with her, he had occaſion, in the
viſits, which he paid her, to obſerve the beauty, the youth, the charms of
Anne Boleyn. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the accompliſhments of her mind no way inferior to her
exterior graces, he <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0429000101:157"/> even entertained the deſign of
raiſing her to the throne; and was the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in this reſolution,
when he found that her virtue and modeſty prevented all hopes of gratifying
his paſſion after any other manner. And as every motive of inclination and
policy, ſeemed thus to concur in making the King deſirous of a divorce from
Catherine, and as his proſpect of ſucceſs was inviting, he reſolved to
make applications to Clement, and he ſent Knight, his ſecretary, to Rome
for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Henry applies to the pope for a
divorce.</note> THAT he might not ſhock the haughty claims of the pontiff, it
was reſolved not to found the application on any general doubts of the papal
power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit marriage in the nearer degrees of conſanguinity; but only to
inſiſt on parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular grounds of invalidity in the bull, which Julius had
granted for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Henry and Catherine. It was a maxim in the court
of Rome, that, if the pope be ſurprized into any conceſſion, or grant any
indulgence upon falſe ſuggeſtions, the bull may afterwards be annulled;
and this pretence had uſually been employed, wherever one pope had recalled
any deed, executed by any of his predeceſſors. But Julius's bull, when
examined, afforded plentiful matter of this kind; and any tribunal, favourable
to Henry, needed not want a ſpecious colour for gratifying him in his
applications for a divorce. It was ſaid in the preamble, that the bull had
been granted upon his ſollicitation; tho' it was known, that, at that time,
he was below twelve years of age: It was alſo affirmed, as another motive for
the bull, that the marriage was requiſite, in order to preſerve peace
between the two crowns; tho' it is certain, that there was not then any ground
or appearance of quarrel between them. Theſe falſe premiſes in Julius's
bull, ſeemed to afford Clement a ſufficient reaſon or pretence for
annulling it, and granting Henry a diſpenſation for a ſecond
marriage<note n="‡" place="bottom">Collier, Eccleſ. Hiſt. vol. II. p.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The pope favourable.</note> BUT tho' the
pretext for this indulgence had been leſs plauſible, the pope was in ſuch
a ſituation, that he had the ſtrongeſt motive to embrace every
oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of gratifying the Engliſh monarch. He was then a priſoner in
the hands of the emperor, and had no hopes of recovering his liberty on any
reaſonable terms, unleſs by the efforts of the league, which Henry had
formed with Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis and the Italian powers, in order to oppoſe the
exorbitant ambition of Charles. When the Engliſh Secretary, therefore, made
private applications to him, he received a very favourable anſwer; and a
diſpenſation was forthwith promiſed to be expeded to his maſter<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. I. p. 47.</note>. Soon after, the march of a
French army into Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, under the command of Lautrec, obliged the
imperialiſts to give Clement his liberty; and he retired to Orvietto, where
the Secretary, with Sir Gregory Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſali, the King's reſident at Rome,
renewed their applications to him. They <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0429000101:158"/> found him
ſtill full of high profeſſions of friendſhip, gratitude, and attachment
to the King; but not ſo expeditious in granting his requeſt as they
expected. The emperor, who had got intelligence of Henry's application to Rome,
had exacted a promiſe of the pope, to take no ſteps in that affair before
he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated them to the imperial miniſters; and Clement, confined by
this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and ſtill more overawed by the emperor's forces in Italy,
ſeemed willing to poſtpone thoſe conceſſions deſired of him by
Henry. Importuned, however, by the Engliſh miniſters, he at laſt put into
their hands a <hi>commiſſion</hi> to Wolſey, as legate, in conjunction
with the archbiſhop of Canterbury, or any other Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh prelate, to
examine the validity of the King's marriage, and of Julius's
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation<note n="†" place="bottom">Rymer, XIV. 237.</note>: He
alſo granted them a proviſional <hi>diſpenſation</hi> for the King's
mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with any other perſon; and promiſed ſoon to expede a
<hi>decretal bull,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling the marriage with Catherine. But he
repreſented to them the dangerous conſequences, which muſt enſue to
him, if theſe conceſſions ſhould come to the emperor's knowledge; and
he conjured them not to publiſh thoſe papers, or make any further uſe of
them, till his affairs were in ſuch a ſituation as to ſecure his liberty
and independance. And his ſecret advice was, whenever they ſhould find the
proper time of opening the ſcene, that they ſhould prevent all
oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by proceeding immediately to a concluſion, by declaring the
marriage with Catherine invalid, and by Henry's inſtantly eſpouſing
ſome other perſon. Nor would it be ſo difficult, he ſaid, for himſelf
to confirm theſe proceedings, after they were paſſed, as previouſly to

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1528</label> WHEN Henry received the
commiſſion and diſpenſation from his ambaſſadors, and was informed

aſked their opinion in ſo delicate a ſituation. The Engliſh
counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors conſidered the danger of proceeding in the manner pointed out
to them. Should the pope refuſe to confirm a deed, which he might juſtly
call precipitate and irregular, and ſhould he diſavow the advice which he
gave in ſo clandeſtine a manner, the King would find his ſecond marriage
totally invalidated; any chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which it might bring him, declared

apprehenſions of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, or even probability, of ſuch an
event, were much confirmed, when he reflected on the character and ſituation
of the ſovereign pontiff.</p>
               <p>CLEMENT the ſeventh was a prince of excellent judgment,
whenever his timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, to which he was extremely ſubject, allowed him to
make full uſe of thoſe <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0429000101:159"/> talents, and that
penetration, with which he was endowed<note n="*" place="bottom">Father Paul,
lib. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Guicciardini.</note>. The captivity, and other misfortunes, which
he had undergone, by entering into a league againſt Charles, had ſo
affected his imagination, that he never afterwards exerted himſelf with
vigour in any public meaſures, eſpecially if the intereſts or
inclinations of that potentate ſtood in oppoſition to him. The imperial
forces were, at preſent, powerful in Italy, and might return to the attack of
Rome, which was ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs, and expoſed to the ſame calamities
with which it had already been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed. And beſides theſe dangers,
Clement found or fancied himſelf expoſed to perils, which threatned,
ſtill more immediately, his perſon and dignity.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The emperor threatens him.</note> CHARLES,
apprized of the timid diſpoſition of the holy father, threw out perpetual
menaces of ſummoning a general council; which, he repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as
neceſſary to reform the church, and correct thoſe exorbitant abuſes,
which the ambition and avarice of the court of Rome had introduced into every
branch of eccleſiaſtical adminiſtration. The power of Clement himſelf,
he ſaid, the ſovereign pontiff, required limitation; his conduct called
aloud for amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and even his title to the throne, which he filled, might
juſtly be brought in queſtion. That pope had always paſſed for the
natural ſon of Julian of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici, who was of the ſovereign family of
Florence; and tho' Leo the tenth, his couſin, had declared him legitimate,
upon a pretended promiſe of marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his father and mother, few
perſons believed that declaration to be founded on any juſt reaſon or
authority<note n="†" place="bottom">Father Paul, lib. 1.</note>. The canon
law, indeed, had been entirely ſilent with regard to the promotion of
baſtards to the papal throne; but, what was ſtill dangerous, the people had
entertained a violent prepoſſeſſion, that that ſtain in the birth of
any perſon was ſufficient to incapacitate him for ſo holy an office. And
in another point, the canon law was expreſs and poſitive, that no man,
guilty of ſimony, could attain that dignity. A ſevere bull of Julius the
ſecond had added new ſanctions to this law, by declaring, that a
ſimoniacal elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould not be rendered valid, even by a poſterior
conſent of the cardinals. But unfortunately Clement had given to cardinal
Colonna a billet, containing promiſes of advancing that cardinal, in caſe
he himſelf ſhould attain the papal dignity by his concurrence: And this
billet, Colonna, who was in entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the emperor, threatned every
moment to expoſe to public view<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>
               <p>WHILE Charles terrified the pope with theſe menaces, he alſo
allured him by hopes, which were no leſs prevalent over his affections. At
the time that the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's forces ſacked Rome, and reduced Clement to
captivity, the Florentines, paſſionate for their ancient liberty, had taken
advantage of his diſtreſſes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0429000101:160"/>
againſt the family of Medici, had entirely aboliſhed their authority in
Florence, and re-eſtabliſhed the former democracy. The better to protect
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their freedom, they had entered into the alliance with France,
England, and Venice, againſt the emperor; and Clement found, that, by this
intereſt, the hands of his confederates were tied from aſſiſting him in
the reſtoration of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; the event, which, of all others, he moſt
paſſionately deſired. The empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror alone, he knew, was able to effectuate
this purpoſe; and therefore, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever profeſſions he made of fidelity to
his allies, he was always, on the leaſt glimpſe of hope, ready to embrace
every propoſal of a cordial reconcilement with that monarch<note n="‡" place="bottom">Father Paul.</note>.</p>
               <p>THESE views and intereſts of the pope were well known in
England; and as the oppoſition of the emperor was foreſeen to Henry's
divorce, both on account of the honour and intereſts of Catherine, his aunt,
and the obvious motive of diſtreſſing an enemy, it was eſteemed
dangerous to take any meaſure of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, in expectation of the
ſubſequent concurrence of a man of Clement's character, whoſe behaviour
contained always ſo much duplicity, and who was at preſent ſo little at
his own diſpoſal. The ſafeſt meaſure ſeemed to conſiſt in
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly engaging him ſo far, that he could not afterwards recede, and
in making uſe of his preſent ambiguity and uncertainty, to extort the

him a more ſure and expeditious way of extricating himſelf from his

if a vacancy had then happened, there was a probability of his reaching that
ſummit of his ambition. But the pope recovered his health, tho' after
ſeveral relapſes; and he returned to the ſame train of falſe and
deceitful politics, by which he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto amuſed the Engliſh court. He
ſtill flattered Henry with profeſſions of the moſt cordial attachment,

the reſolution of ſacrificing all his promiſes, and all the intereſts

enemies. The queen herſelf was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally of a firm and reſolute temper;
and was engaged by every motive to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in proteſting againſt the
injuſtice to which ſhe thought herſelf expoſed. The imputation of
inceſt, which was thrown upon her marriage with Henry, ſtruck her with the
higheſt indignation: The illegitimacy of her daughter, which ſeemed a
neceſſary conſequence, gave her the moſt juſt concern: The reluctance
of yielding to a rival, who, ſhe believed, had ſupplanted her in the King's
affections, was a very natural motive. Actuated by all theſe
conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhe never ceaſed ſolliciting her nephew's
aſſiſtance, and earneſtly entreating an avocation of the cauſe to
Rome, where alone, ſhe thought, ſhe could expect juſtice. And the

rendered the more affecting. She told him, that ſhe was a ſtranger in his

expoſed to all the injuſtice, which her enemies were pleaſed to impoſe

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhe was aſſured in them of a ſafeguard againſt every
misfortune: That ſhe had been his wife during twenty years, and would here
appeal to himſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her affectionate ſubmiſſion to his will had
not merited other treatment, than to be thus, after ſo long a time, thrown
from him with ſo much indignity: That ſhe was conſcious—he
himſelf was aſſured—that her virgin honour was yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained,
when he received her into his bed, and that her connections with his brother
had been carried no further than the ceremony of marriage: That their parents,
the Kings of England and Spain, were eſteemed the wiſeſt princes 
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0429000101:163"/> of their time, and had undoubtedly acted by the beſt
council, when they form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the agreement for that marriage, which was now
repreſented as ſo criminal and unnatural: And that ſhe acquieſced in
their judgment, and would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her cauſe to be tried by a court,
whoſe dependance on her enemies was too viſible, ever to allow her any
hopes of obtaining from them an equitable or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial deciſion<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. I. p. 73. Hall. Stow, p. 543.</note>. Having ſpoke
theſe words, ſhe roſe, and making the King a low reverence, ſhe
departed from the court, and never would again appear in it.</p>
               <p>AFTER her departure, the King did her the juſtice to
acknowledge, that ſhe had ever been a dutiful and affectionate wife, and that
the whole tenor of her behaviour had been conformable to the ſtricteſt
rules of probity and honour. He only inſiſted on his own ſcruples, with
regard to the lawfulneſs of their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and he explained the origin, the
progreſs, and the foundation of thoſe doubts, by which he had been ſo
long and ſo violently agitated. He acquitted cardinal Wolſey of having any
hand in encouraging his ſcruples; and he begged a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the court,
conformable to the juſtice of his cauſe.</p>
               <p>THE legates, after citing the queen anew to appear before them,
declared her <hi>contumacious,</hi> notwithſtanding her appeal to Rome; and
then proceeded to the examination of the cauſe. The firſt point which came
before them, was, the proof of prince Arthur's conſummation of his marriage
with Catherine; and it muſt be confeſſed, that no ſtronger arguments
could reaſonably be expected of ſuch a fact after ſo long an interval.
The age of the prince, who had paſſed his fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year, the good ſtate
of his health, the long time that he had cohabited with his ſpouſe, many of
his expreſſions to that very purpoſe; all theſe circumſtances form a
violent preſumption, in favour of the King's aſſertion<note n="†" place="bottom">Herbert.</note>. Henry himſelf, after his brother's death, was
not allowed for ſome time to bear the title of prince of Wales, in
expectation of her pregnancy: The Spaniſh ambaſſador, in order the better
to enſure poſſeſſion of her jointure, had ſent over to Spain,
proofs of the conſummation of her marriage<note n="‡" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. II. p. 35.</note>: Julius's bull itſelf was founded
on the ſuppoſition, that Arthur had <hi>perhaps</hi> had knowledge of the

the former marriage with prince Arthur, is acknowledged on both ſiles<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ryme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

XIII. p. 81.</note>. Theſe particulars were all laid before the court;
accompanied with many reaſonings concerning the extent of the pope's
authority, and his power of granting a diſpenſation to marry within the
prohibited degrees. Campeggio heard theſe doctrines with great impatience;
and notwithſtanding his reſolution to protract the cauſe, he was often
tempted <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0429000101:164"/> to interrupt and ſilence the King's council,
when they inſiſted on ſuch diſagreeable topics. The trial was ſpun
out till the 23d of July; and Campeggio chiefly took on him the part of
conducting it. Wolſey, tho' the elder cardinal, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to act as
preſident of the court; becauſe it was thought, that a trial, managed by an
Italian cardinal, would carry the appearance of greater candour and
impartiality, than if the King's own miniſter and favourite had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided
in it. The buſineſs now ſeemed to be drawing near a period; and the King
was every day in expectation of a ſentence in his favour; when, to his great
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, Campeggio, on a ſudden, without any warning, and upon very
frivolous pretences<note n="‡" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. 1. p. 76,
77.</note>, prorogued the court, till the firſt of October. 
<note place="margin">The cauſe evoked to Rome.</note> The
avocation, which came a few days after from Rome, put an end to all the hopes
of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, which the King had ſo long and ſo anxiouſly
cheriſhed<note n="§" place="bottom">Herbert, p. 254.</note>.</p>
               <p>DURING the time, that the trial was carried on before the
legates at London, the emperor had by his miniſters earneſtly ſollicited
Clement to evoke the cauſe to Rome; and had employed every topic of hope or
terror, which could operate either on the paſſion or timidity of the
pontiff. The Engliſh ambaſſadors, on the other hand, in conjunction with
the French, had been no leſs earneſt in their applications, that the
legates ſhould be allowed to finiſh the trial; but, tho' they employed the
ſame engines of promiſes and menaces, the objects, which they could ſet
before the pope, were not ſo inſtant nor immediate as thoſe which were
held up to him by the emperor<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. 1. p.
75.</note>. The dread of loſing England, and of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Lutherans by
ſo conſiderable an acceſſion, made ſmall impreſſion on Clement's
mind, in compariſon of the anxiety for his own perſonal ſafety, and the
fond deſire of reſtoring the Medici to their dominion in Florence. So
ſoon, therefore, as he had adjuſted all terms with the emperor, he laid
hold of the pretence of juſtice, which required him, he ſaid, to pay regard
to the queen's appeal; and ſuſpending the commiſſion of the legates, he
evoked the cauſe to Rome. The legate, Campeggio, had beforehand received
private orders, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by Campana, to burn the decretal bull, with which he
was entruſted.</p>
               <p>WOLSEY had long foreſeen this meaſure as the ſure
fore-runner of his own ruin. Tho' he had at firſt deſired, that the King
ſhould rather marry a French princeſs than Anne Boleyn, he had employed
himſelf with the utmoſt aſſiduity and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to bring the
affair to an happy iſſue<note n="†" place="bottom">Collier, vol. 2. p.
45. Burnet, vol. 1. p. 53.</note>: He was not therefore to be blamed for the
unproſperous event, which the pope's partiality had produced. But he had
ſufficient experience of the extreme ardour and impatience of Henry's
tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who could bear no contradiction, and who was wont, without examination
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0429000101:165"/> or diſtinction, to make his miniſters anſwerable
for the iſſue of thoſe tranſactions, with which they were entruſted.
Anne Boleyn alſo, who was prepoſſeſſed againſt him, had imputed to
him the failure of her hopes; and as ſhe was newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to court, whence
ſhe had been removed, from a regard to decency, during the trial before the
legates, ſhe had naturally acquired an additional in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on Henry's mind,
and ſhe ſerved much to fortify his prejudices againſt the cardinal<note n="‡" place="bottom">Cavendiſh, p. 40.</note>. Even the queen and her partizans,
judging of Wolſey by the part which he had openly acted, had expreſſed
the higheſt animoſity againſt him; and the moſt oppoſite factions
ſeemed now to combine in the ruin of this haughty miniſter. The high
opinion itſelf, which Henry had entertained of the cardinal's capacity,
tended to haſten his downfal; while he imputed the bad ſucceſs of that
miniſter's undertakings, not to fortune or miſtake, but to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
or infidelity of his intentions. The blow, however, fell not inſtantly on his
head. The King, who probably could not juſtify by any good reaſon his
alienation from his antient favourite, ſeems to have remained ſome time in
ſuſpence; and he received him, if not with all his former kindneſs, at
leaſt with the appearance of truſt and regard.</p>

               <p>WOLSEY was ordered to depart from York Place, a palace which he
had built in London, and which, tho' it really belonged to the ſee of York,
was ſeized by Henry, and became afterwards the reſidence of the Kings of
England, under the title of Whitehall. All his furniture and plate were
converted to the King's uſe. Their riches and ſplendour beſitted rather a
royal than a private fortune. The walls of his palace were covered with cloth
of gold or cloth of ſilver: He had a cupboard of plate of maſſy gold:
There were found a thouſand pieces of ſine holland belonging to him. All
the reſt of his riches and furniture was in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; and his opulence was

world, who had paid him ſuch abject court during his proſperity, now
entirely deſerted him, on this fatal reverſe of all his fortunes. He
himſelf was much dejected with the change; and from the ſame turn of mind,
which had made him be ſo vainly elated with his grandeur, he felt the blow of
adverſity with double rigour<note n="†" place="bottom">Strype, vol. 1.

return to favour threw him into tranſports of joy, unbecoming a man. The King
had ſeemed willing, during ſome time, to intermit the blows, which
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed him. He granted him his protection, and leſt him in
poſſeſſion of the ſees of York and Wincheſter. He even ſent him a
gracious meſſage, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a ring, as a teſtimony of his
affection. Wolſey, who was on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back when the meſſenger met him,
immediately alighted; and throwing himſelf on his knees in the dirt, received
in that humble poſture theſe marks of his majeſty's gracious
diſpoſition towards him<note n="‡" place="bottom">Stowe, p.

               <p>BUT his enemies, who dreaded his return to court, never ceaſed
plying the King with accounts of his ſeveral offences; and Anne Boleyn in
particular, who bore him no kindneſs, contributed her endeavours, in
conjunction with her uncle the duke of Norfolk, to exclude him from all hopes
of ever being reinſtated in his former authority. He diſmiſſed
therefore his numerous retinue; and as he was a kind and beneficent maſter,
the ſeparation paſſed not without a plentiful effuſion of tears on both
ſides<note n="§" place="bottom">Cavendiſh. Stowe, 549.</note>. The
King's heart, notwithſtanding ſome gleams of kindneſs, ſeemed now
totally hardened againſt his old favourite. He ordered him to be indicted in
the Star Chamber, where a ſentence was paſſed upon him. And not contented
with this ſeverity, he abandoned him to all the rigour of the Parliament,
which now, after a long interval, was again aſſembled. 
<note place="margin">3d November.</note> The houſe of lords voted
a long charge againſt Wolſey, conſiſting of forty-four articles; and
accompanied it with an application to the King for his puniſhment, and his

Yet the refutation of the articles by Cromwel, and their being rejected by a

of Wolſey's innocence. Henry was, no doubt, entirely bent on his
deſtruction, when, on his failure by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary impeachment, he
attacked him upon the ſtatute of proviſors, which afforded him ſo little

               <p>WOLSEY'S enemies, finding that either his innocence or his
caution prevented them from having any juſt ground of accuſing him, had
recourſe to a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary expedient. An indictment was lodged
againſt him; that, contrary to a ſtatute of Richard the ſecond, commonly
called the ſtatute of proviſors, he had procured bulls from Rome,
particularly that inveſting him with the legan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine power, which he had
exerciſed with very extenſive authority. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the indictment,
pleaded ignorance of the ſtatute, and threw himſelf on the King's mercy. He
was perhaps within reach of the law; but beſides that this ſtatute was
fallen altogether into diſuſe, nothing could be more rigorous and ſevere
than to impute to him as a crime, what he had openly, during a courſe of ſo
many years, practiſed with the conſent and approbation of the King, and the
acquieſcence of the Parliament and kingdom. Not to mention, what he always
aſſerted<note n="*" place="bottom">Cavendiſh, page 72.</note>, and what we
can ſcarce doubt of, that he had obtained the royal licence in the moſt
formal manner, which, had he not been apprehenſive of the dangers attending
any oppoſition to Henry's lawleſs will, he might have pleaded in his own
defence before the judges. Sentence, however, was pronounced againſt him,

Grey's-Inn, which is of a very ſingular nature, and contains ſuch topics as

inſiſts upon the vaſt variety of theological opinions, which prevailed in

one ſupreme Being, the author of nature; and the neceſſity of good
morals, in order to obtain his favour and protection. Such ſentiments would
be eſteemed latitudinarian, even in our time; and would not be advanced,

               <p>HENRY was not diſpleaſed, that the court of Rome and the
clergy ſhould be ſenſible, that they were entirely dependant on him, and
that his Parliament, if he were willing to ſecond their inclinations, were
ſufficiently diſpoſed to reduce the power and privileges of the
eccleſiaſtics. The commons gratified the King in another particular of
moment: They granted him a diſcharge of all thoſe debts, which he had
contracted ſince the beginning of his reign: And they grounded this bill,
which occaſioned many complaints, on a pretence of the King's great care of
the nation, and of his employing regularly all the money, which he had
borrowed, in the public ſervice. Moſt of the King's creditors conſiſted
of friends to the cardinal, who had been engaged by their patron to contribute
to the ſupply of Henry's demands; and the preſent courtiers were well

                  <note place="margin">Foreign affairs.</note> THE domeſtic
tranſactions of England were at preſent ſo intereſting to the King,
that they chiefly engaged his attention; and he regarded foreign affairs only
in ſubordination to them. He had declared war againſt the emperor; but the
mutual advantages reaped by the commerce between England and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands
had engaged him to ſtipulate a neutrality with thoſe provinces; and except
by money contributed to the Italian wars, he had in effect exerciſed no
hoſtilities againſt any of the imperial dominions. A general peace was this
ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eſtabliſhed in Europe. Margaret of Auſtria and Louiſe of
Savoy met at Cambray, and ſettled the terms of pacification between the
French King and the emperor. Charles accepted of two millions of crowns in lieu
of Burgundy; and he delivered up the two princes of France, whom he had
retained as hoſtages. Henry was ſo generous to his friend and ally Francis,
that he ſent him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital of near 600,000 crowns, which that prince owed
him. Francis's Italian confederates were not ſo well ſatisfied as the King
with the peace of Cambray: They were there almoſt wholly abandoned to the
will of the emperor; and ſeemed to have no other means of ſecurity left,
but his equity and moderation. Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, after a brave reſiſtance, was
ſubdued by the imperial arms, and finally deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over to the dominion of
the family of Medici. The Venetians were better <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0429000101:170"/> treated:
They were only obliged to relinquiſh ſome acquiſitions, which they had
made on the coaſt of Naples. Even Francis S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orza obtained the inveſtiture of Milan, and was pardoned all his
paſt offences. The emperor in perſon paſſed over into Italy with a
magnificent train, and received the imperial crown from the hands of the pope
at Bologna. He was but twenty nine years of age; and having already, by his
vigour and capacity, ſucceeded in every enterprize, and reduced to captivity
the two greateſt potentates in Europe, the one ſpiritual, the other
temporal, he attracted the eyes of all men; and many prognoſtications were
formed of his growing empire.</p>
               <p>BUT tho' Charles ſeemed to be proſperous on every ſide,
and the conqueſt of Mexico and Peru now began to prevent that ſearcity of
money, under which he had hitherto laboured, he found himſelf threatened with
difficulties in Germany; and his deſire of remedying them was the chief
cauſe of his granting ſuch mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate conditions to the powers in Italy.
Sultan Solyman, the greateſt and moſt accompliſhed prince, that ever
ſat on the Ottoman throne, had almoſt entirely ſubdued Hungary, had
beſieged Vienna, and, tho' repulſed, ſtill menaced the hereditary
dominions of the houſe of Auſtria with conqueſt and ſubjection. The
Lutheran princes in the empire, finding, that liberty of conſcience was
denied them, had combined in a league for their own defence at Smalcalde; and
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they proteſted againſt the votes of the imperial diet, they
thenceforth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the appellation of <hi>proteſtants.</hi> Charles had
undertaken to reduce them to obedience; and under pretence of ſecuring the
purity of religion, he had laid a ſcheme of aggrandizing his own family, by
extending its dominions over all Germany.</p>
               <p>THE friendſhip of Henry was one material circumſtance yet
wanting to Charles, in order to render his ambitious projects feaſible; and
the King was ſufficiently acquainted, that the concurrence of that prince
would at once remove all the difficulties, which lay in the way of his divorce;
that point, which had long been the object of his moſt earneſt wiſhes.
But beſides that the intereſts of his kingdom ſeemed to require a
confederacy with France, his haughty ſpirit could not brook a friendſhip
impoſed on him by conſtraint; and as he had ever been accuſtomed to
receive courtſhip, ſubmiſſion, and ſollicitation from the greateſt
potentates, he could ill bear that dependance, to which this unhappy affair
ſeemed to have reduced him. Amidſt the anxieties with which he was
agitated, he was often tempted to break off all connexion with the court of
Rome; and tho' he had been educated in a ſuperſtitious reverence to the
papal authority, it is likely, that his perſonal experience of the duplicity
and ſelfiſh politics of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had ſerved much to open his eyes in
that particular. He found his royal <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0429000101:171"/> prerogative firmly
eſtabliſhed at home: He obſerved that his people were in general much
diſguſted with clerical uſurpations, and diſpoſed to reduce the
powers and privileges of the eccleſiaſtical order: He knew, that they had
cordially taken part with him in his proſecution of a divorce, and highly
reſented that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy treatment, which, after ſo many ſervices and
ſuch devoted attachment, he had received from the court of Rome. Anne Boleyn
alſo could not fail, by her inſinuations, to engage him into extremities
with the pope, both as it was the readieſt way to her attaining royal
dignity, and as her education in the court of the dutcheſs of Alançon,
a princeſs inclined to the reformers, had already diſpoſed her to a
belief of the new doctrines. But notwithſtanding all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements,
Henry had ſtrong motives ſtill to deſire a good agreement with the
ſovereign pontiff. He apprehended the danger of ſuch great innovations: He
dreaded the reproach of hereſy: He abhorred all connexions with the
Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, the chief opponents of papal power: And having once exerted
himſelf with ſuch applauſe, as he imagined, in defence of the Romiſh
communion, he was aſhamed to retract his former opinions, and betray from
paſſion ſuch a palpable inconſiſtency. While he was agitated by
theſe contrary motives, an expedient was propoſed, which, as it promiſed
a ſolution of all difficulties, was embraced by him with the greateſt joy
and ſatisfaction.</p>

                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0429000101:172"/> HAD the queſtion of Henry's marriage
with Catherine been examined by the principles of ſound philoſophy, exempt
from ſuperſtition, it ſeemed not liable to much difficulty. The natural
reaſon, why marriage in certain degrees is prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the civil laws, and
condemned by the moral ſentiments of all nations, is derived from men's care
to preſerve purity of manners; while they reflect, that if a commerce of love
were authorized between the neareſt relations, the frequent opportunities of
intimate converſation, eſpecially during early youth, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce an
univerſal diſſoluteneſs and corruption. But as the cuſtoms of
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries vary conſiderably, and open an intercourſe, more or leſs
reſtrained, between different families, or between the ſeveral members of
the ſame family, ſo we find, that the moral precept, varying with its
cauſe, is ſuſceptible, without any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, of very different
latitude in the ſeveral ages and nations of the world. The extreme delicacy
of the Greeks, permitted no converſe between perſons of the two fexes,
except where they lived under the ſame roof; and even the apartments of a
ſtep-mother, and her daughters, were almoſt as much ſhut up againſt
viſits from the huſband's ſons, as againſt thoſe from any ſtrangers
or more remote relations: Hence in that nation it was lawful for a man to
marry, not only his niece, but his half<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſiſter by the father: A
liberty unknown to the Romans, and other nations, where a more open
intercourſe was authoriſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſexes. Reaſoning from this
principle, it would appear, that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary commerce of life among great
princes, is ſo obſtructed by ceremony, and numerous attendants, that no ill
conſequence would reſult among them, from the marriage of a brother's
widow; eſpecially if the diſpenſation of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign prieſt is
previouſly required, in order to juſtify what may in common caſes be
condemned, and to hinder the precedent from becoming too common and familiar.
And as ſtrong motives of public intereſt and tranquillity may frequently
require ſuch alliances between the ſovereign families, there is leſs
reaſon for extending towards them the full rigour of that rule which has
place among individuals<note n="*" place="bottom">Even judging of this queſtion
by the ſcripture, to which the appeal was every moment made, the arguments
for the King's cauſe appear but lame and imperfect. Marriage in the degree of
affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which had place between Henry and Catherine, is, indeed, prohibited
in Leviticus; but it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to interpret that prohibition as a part of the
Jewiſh ceremonial or municipal law: And tho' it is there ſaid, in the

neareſt degrees of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity: Inſtances of a like nature occur among
the patriarchs: And the marriage of a brother's widow was, in certain caſes,
not only permitted, but even enjoined as a poſitive precept by the
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical law. It is in vain to ſay, that this precept was an exception to
the rule; and an exception con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined merely to the Jewiſh nation. The

conſequences, they feared, would prove ſo fatal to the ancient religion:
Their opinion however, conformable to that of the other univerſities of
Europe, was at laſt procured; and the King, in order to give weight to all
theſe authorities, engaged his nobility to write a letter to the pope,
recommending his cauſe to the holy father, and threatning him with the moſt
dangerous conſequences in caſe of a denial of juſtice<note n="§" place="bottom">Rymer XIV. 405. Burnet, vol. I. p. 95.</note>. The convocations

irregular, and contrary to the law of God, with which no human power had
authority to diſpenſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer XIV. 454, 472.</note>.
But Clement lying ſtill under the influence of the emperor, continued to
ſummon the King to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, either by himſelf or proxy, before his tribunal
at Rome; and the King, who knew that he could expect no fair trial there,
refuſed to ſubmit to ſuch a condition, and would not even admit of any
citation, which he regarded as a high inſult, and a violation of his royal
prerogative. The Father of Anne Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn, created earl of Wiltſhire, carried
to the pope the King's reaſons for not <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0429000101:174"/> appearing by

to kiſs his holineſs's foot, which he very graciouſly held out to him for
that purpoſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. I. p. 94.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE extremities to which Henry was puſhed, both againſt the
pope and the eccleſiaſtical order, were naturally very diſagreeable to
cardinal Wolſey; and as Henry foreſaw his oppoſition, it is the moſt
probable reaſon which can be aſſigned for his continuing to perſecute
with ſo much rigour his ancient favourite. After Wolſey had remained ſome
time at Aſher, he was allowed to remove to Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, a palace which he had
received as a preſent from Henry, in return for Hampton-Court: But the
courtiers, dreading ſtill his near neighbourhood to the King, procured an
order for him to remove to his ſee of York. The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal knew it was vain to
reſiſt: He took up his reſidence at Cawood in York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, where he
rendered himſelf extremely popular to the neighbourhood, by his affability
and hoſpitality<note n="†" place="bottom">Cavendiſh. Stowe, p.
554.</note>: but he was not allowed to remain long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted in this
retreat. The earl of Northumberland received orders, without regard to
Wolſey's eccleſiaſtical character, to arreſt him for high treaſon,
and to conduct him to London, in order to his trial. The cardinal, partly from
the fatigues of the journey, partly from the agitation of his anxious mind, was
ſeized with a diſorder which turned into a dyſentery; and he was able,
with ſome difficulty, to reach Leiceſter-abbey. When the abbot and monks
advanced to receive him with much reſpect and ceremony, he told them, that he
was come to lay his bones among them; and he immediately took his bed, whence
he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver roſe more. 
<note place="margin">28 Novemb.</note> A little before he expired,
he addreſſed himſelf in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words to Sir William Kingſton,
conſtable of the Tower, who had him in cuſtody. 
<q rend="inline">"I pray you, have me heartily recommended unto
his royal majeſty, and beſeech him on my behalf to call to his remembrance
all matters that have paſſed between us from the beginning, eſpecially
with regard to his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with the queen; and then will he know in his
conſcience whether I have offended him. 
<p>"HE is a prince of a moſt royal carriage, and hath a princely

ſometimes three hours together, to perſuade him from his will and appetite;

                  <note place="margin">Wolſey's death.</note> THUS died this
famous cardinal, whoſe character ſeems to have contained as ſingular a
variety as the fortune to which he was expoſed. The obſtinacy and violence
of the King's temper may alleviate much of the blame which ſome of his
favourite's meaſures have undergone; and when we conſider, that the
ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent part of Henry's reign was much more unfortunate and criminal
than that which was directed by Wolſey's councils, we ſhall be inclined to
ſuſpect of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality thoſe hiſtorians, who have endeavoured to load
his memory with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent reproaches. If in foreign politics, he
ſometimes employed his influence over the King for his private purpoſes,
rather than his maſter's intereſt, which, he boaſted, he had ſolely at
heart; we muſt remember, that he had in view the papal throne; a dignity,
which, had he attained it, would have enabled him to make Henry a ſuitable
return for all his favours. The cardinal d'Amboiſe, whoſe memory is
precious in France, always made this apology for his own conduct, which was, in
ſome reſpects, ſimilar to Wolſey's; and we have reaſon to think, that
Henry was well acquainted with the motives by which his miniſter was
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced. He regreted very much his death, when informed of it; and always
ſpoke favourably of his memory: A proof, that humour more than reaſon, or
any diſcovery of treachery, had occaſioned his laſt perſecutions
againſt him.</p>

Parliament was held, together with a convocation; and the King gave ſtrong
proofs of his extenſive authority, as well as of his intention to employ it
to the depreſſion of the Clergy. As an ancient ſtatute, now almoſt
become obſolete, had been made uſe of to ruin Wolſey, and render his
exerciſe of the legantine power criminal, notwithſtanding the King's
permiſſion; the ſame law was now turned againſt the eccleſiaſtics.
It was pretended, that every one who had ſubmitted to the legantine
authority, that is, the whole church, had violated the ſtatute of
proviſors; and the attorney-general brought accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly an indictment
againſt them<note n="*" place="bottom">Antiq Brit. Eccleſ. p. 325. Burnet,

reaſon or equity to the King's arbitrary will, or plead that their ruin would
have been the certain conſequence of not ſubmitting to Wolſey's
commiſſion, which was procured by Henry's conſent, and ſupported by his
authority. They choſe therefore to throw themſelves on the mercy of their
ſovereign; and they agreed to pay 118,840 l. for their pardon<note n="†" place="bottom">Hollingſhed, p. 923.</note>. A confeſſion was
likewiſe extorted from them, that <hi>the King was the protector and the

remiſſion to his lay ſubjects; but met with a repulſe. He told them,
that, if he ever pleaſed to forgive their offence, it would be from his own
goodneſs, not from their application, leſt he ſhould ſeem to be
compelled to it. Some time after, when they deſpaired of obtaining this
conceſſion, he was pleaſed to iſſue a pardon to the laity; and the

<note place="margin">Progreſs of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> A tax
which was impoſed by the court of Rome for granting bulls to the new
prelates, and which was found to amount to conſiderable ſums. Since the
ſecond of Henry the ſeventh, no leſs than one hundred and ſixty
thouſand pounds had been tranſmitted to Rome, on account of this claim;
which the Parliament, therefore, reduced to five per cent. of all the
epiſcopal benefices. The better to keep the pope in awe, the King was
entruſted with a power of regulating theſe payments, and of confirming or
infringing this act at his pleaſure: And it was voted, that any cenſures
which ſhould be paſſed by the court of Rome, on account of that law,
ſhould be entirely diſregarded, and that maſs ſhould be ſaid, and the
ſacraments adminiſtered, as if no ſuch cenſures had been
iſſued.</p>
               <p>THIS ſeſſion the commons preferred to the King, a long
complaint againſt the abuſes and oppreſſions of the eccleſiaſtical
courts; and they were proceeding to enact laws for remedying them, when a
difference aroſe, which put an end to the ſeſſion, before the
Parliament had finiſhed all their buſineſs. It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a cuſtom for
men to make ſuch ſettlements, or truſt deeds, of their land by will, that
they defrauded, not only the King, but all other lords, of their wards,
marriages, and reliefs; and by the ſame artifice the King was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of
his primier ſeiſin, and the profits of the livery, which were no
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable branches of the revenue. Henry made a bill be drawn to
mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, not remedy altogether, this abuſe: He was contented, that every
man <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0429000101:177"/> ſhould have the liberty of diſpoſing in this
manner of the half of his land; and he told the Parliament in plain terms, 
<q rend="inline">"If they would not take a reaſonable thing,
when it was offered, he would ſearch out the extremity of the law; and then
would not offer them ſo much again."</q> The lords came willingly into his
terms; but the commons rejected the bill: A ſingular inſtance, where Henry
might ſee, that his power and authority, tho' extenſive, had yet ſome
boundaries. The commons, however, found reaſon to repent of their victory.
The King made good his threats: He called together the judges and ableſt
law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, who argued the queſtion in chancery; and it was decided, that a man
could not by law bequeath any part of his lands, in prejudice of his heir<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. I. p. 116. Hall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Parliamentary

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">10 April.</note> THE Parliament being again
aſſembled after a ſhort prorogation, the King cauſed the two oaths to
be read to them, that which the biſhops took to the pope, and that to the
King, on their inſtallation; and as a contradiction might be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
between them, while the prelates ſeemed to ſwear allegiance to two
ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns<note n="†" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. I. p. 123,
124.</note>, the Parliament ſhowed their intention of aboliſhing the oath
to the pope, when their proceedings were ſuddenly ſtopped by the breaking
out of the plague at Weſtminſter, which occaſioned a prorogation. It is
remarkable, that one Temſe ventured this ſeſſion to move, that the
Houſe ſhould addreſs the King, to take back the queen, and ſtop the
proſecution of his divorce. This motion occaſioned the King to ſend for
Audley, the Speaker; and to explain to him the ſcruples with which his
conſcience had ſo long been agitated; ſcruples, he ſaid, which had
proceeded from no wanton appetite, which had ariſen after the fervours of
youth were over, and which were confirmed by the concurring ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of
all the learned ſocieties in Europe. Except in Spain and Portugal, he added,
it was never heard of, that any man had eſpouſed two ſiſters; but he
himſelf had the misfortune, he believed, to be the firſt chriſtian man
who had ever married his brother's widow<note n="‡" place="bottom">Herbert. Hall, fol. 205.</note>.</p>
               <p>AFTER the prorogation, Sir Thomas More, the chancellor,
foreſeeing that all the meaſures of the King and Parliament tended to a
breach with the church of Rome, and to an alteration of religion, which his
principles would not permit him to concur with, deſired leave to reſign the
ſeals; and he deſcended from this high ſtation with more joy and alacrity
than he had mounted up to it. The auſterity of this man's virtue, and the
ſanctity of his manners, had no way en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached on the gentleneſs of his
temper, nor even diminiſhed that frolic and gaity to which he was naturally
inclined. He ſported with all the varieties of fortune into which he was
thrown; and neither the pride naturally attending a <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0429000101:178"/> high
ſtation, nor the melancholy incident to poverty and retreat, could ever lay
hold of his ſerene and equal ſpirit. While his family diſcovered
ſymptoms of ſorrow on laying down the grandeur and magnificence to which
they had been accuſtomed, he drew a ſubject of mirth from their
diſtreſſes; and made them aſhamed of loſing even a moment's
chearfulneſs, on account of ſuch trivial miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. The King, who had
entertained a high opinion of his virtue, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his reſignation with
ſome difficulty; and he beſtowed the ſeals ſoon after on Sir Thomas
Audley.</p>
               <p>DURING theſe tranſactions in England, and theſe
invaſions of the papal and eccleſiaſtical authority, the court of Rome
were not without ſolicitude; and they entertained very juſt apprehenſions
of loſing entirely their authority in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; the kingdom, which, of all
others, had long been moſt devoted to the holy ſee, and which had yielded
it the moſt ample revenue. While the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial cardinals puſhed Clement to
proceed to extremities againſt the King, his more moderate and impartial
counſellors repreſented to him the indignity of his proceedings; that a
great monarch, who had ſignalized himſelf, both by his pen and his ſword,
in the pope's cauſe, ſhould be refuſed a favor, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded on
ſuch juſt grounds, and which had ſcarce ever before been denied to any
perſon of his rank and ſtation. Notwithſtanding theſe remonſtrances,
the Queen's appeal was received at Rome; the King was cited to appear; and
ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtories were held, to examine the validity of their
marriage. Henry was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to ſend any proxy to plead his cauſe
before this court: He only diſpatched Sir Edward Karne and Dr. Bonner, in
quality of excuſators, ſo they were called, to carry his apology, for not
paying that deference to the papal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. The prerogative of his crown, he
ſaid, muſt be ſacrificed, if he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of appeals from his own kingdom;
and as the queſtion regarded conſcience, not power or intereſt, no proxy
could ſupply his place, or convey that ſatisfaction which the dictates of
his own mind could alone confer. 
<note place="margin">11 October.</note> In order to ſupport
himſelf in this meaſure, and add greater ſecurity to his defection from
Rome, he procured an interview with Francis at Boulogne and Calais, where he
renewed his perſonal friendſhip, as well as public alliance, with that
monarch, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed all meaſures for their mutual defence. He even
employed arguments, by which, he believed, he had perſuaded Francis to
imitate his example in withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his obedience from the biſhop of Rome,
and adminiſtering eccleſiaſtical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs without having farther
recourſe to that ſee. 
<note place="margin">14 November.</note> And being now fully
determined in his own mind, as well as reſolute to ſtand all
conſequences, he privately cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated his marriage with Anne Boleyn, whom he
had created marchioneſs of Pembroke. Rouland Lee, ſoon after raiſed to
the biſhopric of Coventry, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0429000101:179"/> at the
marriage. The duke of Norfolk, uncle to the new Queen, her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, mother, and

ſteps, by which they looſened their connections with the ſee of Rome, and
repreſſed the uſurpations of the Roman pontiff. An act was made againſt
all appeals to Rome in cauſes of matrimony, divorces, wills, and other
ſuits cognizable in eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical courts; appeals eſteemed

<note place="margin">12 April.</note> The more to ſhew his
diſregard to the pope, Henry, finding the new Queen's pregnancy to advance,
publicly owned his marriage; and in order to remove all doubts with regard to
its lawfulneſs, he prepared meaſures for declaring, by a formal ſentence,
the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity of his former marriage with Catherine: A ſentence which ought

               <p>THE King, notwithſtanding his ſcruples and remorſes on
account of his firſt marriage, had always treated Catherine with reſpect
and diſtinction; and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, by every ſoft and perſuaſive art,
to engage her to depart from her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Rome, and her oppoſition to his
divorce. Finding her obſtinate in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the juſtice of her cauſe,
he had totally forborne all viſits and intercourſe with her; and had
deſired her to make choice of any one of his palaces in which ſhe ſhould
pleaſe to reſide. She had fixed her court for ſome time at Amphill near
Dunſtable; 
<note place="margin">10 May.</note> and it was in this latter town
that Cranmer, now created arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury, on the death of
Warham<note n="‖" place="bottom">Biſhop Burnet has given us an account
of the number of bulls requiſite for Cranmer's inſtallation. By one
bull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> directed to the King, he is, upon the royal nomination, made
archbiſhop of Canterbury. By a ſecond, directed to himſelf, he is made
archbiſhop. By a third, he is abſolved from all cenſures. A fourth, is to
the ſuffragans, requiring them to receive and acknowledge him as
archbiſhop. A fifth to the dean and chapter, to the ſame purpoſe. A
ſixth to the clergy of Canterbury. A ſeventh to all the laity in his ſee.
An eighth to all that held lands of it. By a ninth he was ordained to be
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, taking the oath that was in the pontifical. By a tenth bull the
pall was ſent him. By an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, the archbiſhop of York, and the
biſhop of London, were required to put it on him. Theſe were ſo many
artifices to draw fees to offices, which the popes had erected, and
diſpoſed of for money. It may be worth obſerving, that Cranmer, before he
took the oath to the pope, made a proteſtation, that he did not intend
thereby to reſtrain himſelf from any thing that he was bound to, either by
his duty to God, the King, or the country; and that he renounced every thing in
it that was contrary to any of theſe. This device was the invention of ſome
caſuiſt, and not very compatible with that ſtrict ſincerity, and that
ſcrupulous conſcience, of which Cranmer made profeſſion. Collier, vol.
II. in Coll. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 22. Burnet, vol. I. p. 128, 129.</note>, was appointed to
open his <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0429000101:180"/> court for examining the validity of her
marriage. The near neighbourhood of the place was choſen in order to deprive
her of all plea of ignorance; and as ſhe made no anſwer to the citation,
neither by herſelf nor proxy, ſhe was declared <hi>contumacious;</hi> and
the primate proceeded to the examination of the cauſe. The evidences of
Arthur's conſummation of the marriage were produced; the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the
univerſities were read; together with the judgment pronounced two years
before by the convocations both of Canterbury and York; and after theſe
preparatory ſteps, Cranmer proceeded to a ſentence, and annulled the King's
marriage with Catherine as unlawful and invalid. By a ſubſequent
ſentence, he ratified the marriage with Anne Boleyn, who ſoon after was
publicly crowned Queen, with all the pomp and dignity ſuited to that
ceremony<note n="*" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 6.</note>. 
<note place="margin">7 September.</note> To compleat the King's
ſatisfaction, on the concluſion of this intricate and vexatious affair,
ſhe was ſafely delivered of a daughter, who received the name of Elizabeth,
and who afterwards ſwayed the ſcepter with ſuch renown and felicity.
Henry was ſo much delighted with the birth of this child, that ſoon after
he conferred on her the title of princeſs of Wales<note n="†" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. I. p. 134.</note>; a ſtep ſomewhat irregular, as
ſhe was only preſumptive, not apparent heir of the crown. But he had,
during his former marriage, thought proper to honour his daughter Mary with
that title; and he was determined to beſtow on the offspring of his preſent
marriage, the ſame marks of diſtinction, as well as exclude Mary from all
hopes of the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. His regard for the new Queen ſeemed rather to
increaſe than diminiſh by his marriage; and all men expected to ſee the
entire aſcendant of one who had mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a throne, from which her birth had
ſet her at ſo great a diſtance, and who, by a proper mixture of
ſeverity and indulgence, had long managed ſo intractable a ſpirit as that
of Henry. In order to efface, as much as poſſible, all marks of his firſt
marriage, Lord Mountjoy was ſent to the unfortunate and divorced Queen, to
inform her, that ſhe was henceforth to be treated only as princeſs dowager
of Wales; and all means were employed to make her acquieſce in that
determination. But ſhe continued obſtinate in maintaining the validity of
her marriage; and ſhe would admit of no ſervice from any perſon, who did
not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach her with the accuſtomed ceremonial. Henry, forgetting his
wonted ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity towards her, employed menaces againſt ſuch of her
ſervants as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0429000101:181"/> with her commands in this

               <p>WHEN intelligence was conveyed to Rome of theſe

declare the nullity of Cranmer's ſentence, as well as that of Henry's
ſecond marriage; threatening him with excommunication, if, before the firſt
of November enſuing, he did not replace every thing in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in
which they formerly ſtood<note n="‡" place="bottom">Le Grand, vol. 3. p.
566.</note>. An event had happened, from which the pontiff expected a more
amicable concluſion of the difference, and which hindered him from carrying
matters to extremity againſt the King.</p>
               <p>THE pope had claims upon the dutchy of Ferrara for the
ſovereignty of Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio and Modena<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. 2. p.
133. Guicciardini.</note>; and having ſubmitted his pretenſions to the
arbitration of the emperor, he was ſurprized to find a ſentence pronounced
againſt him. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at this diſappointment, he hearkened to propoſals
of amity from Francis; and when that monarch made overtures of marrying the
duke of Orleans, his ſecond ſon, with Catherine of Medici, niece to the
pope, Clement gladly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced an alliance, by which his family was ſo much
honoured. An interview was even appointed of the pope and French King at
Marſeilles; and Francis, as a common friend, employed his good offices in
mediating an agreement between his new ally and the King of England.</p>
               <p>HAD this connexion of France with the ſee of Rome taken place
a few years ſooner, there had been little difficulty in compoſing the
quarrel with Henry. The King's requeſt was an ordinary one; and the ſame
plenary power of the pope, which had granted a diſpenſation for his
eſpouſing Catherine, could eaſily have annulled the marriage. But in the
progreſs of the quarrel, the ſtate of affairs was much changed on both
ſides. Henry had ſhaken off much of that reverence with which he had been
early imbued for the apoſtolical ſee; and finding, that his ſubjects of
all ranks had taken part with him, and willingly complied with his movements
for breaking foreign dependance, he had taken a reliſh for his ſpiritual
authority, and would ſcarce, it was apprehended, be induced to renew his
ſubmiſſions to the Roman pontiff. The pope, on the other hand, ran now a
manifeſt riſque of infringing his authority by a compliance with the King;
and <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0429000101:182"/> as a ſentence of divorce could no longer be
reſted on nullities in Julius's bull, but would be conſtrued as an
acknowledgment of papa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

uſurpations, it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, that the Lutherans would thence take
occaſion of triumph, and would perſevere more obſtinately in their
preſent principles. But notwithſtanding theſe obſtacles, Francis did
not deſpair of mediating an agreement. He ſtill obſerved that the King
had ſome remains of prejudice in favour of the apoſtolic ſee, and was
apprehenſive of the conſequences, which might onſue from too violent
inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. He ſaw plainly the intereſt, that Clement had in preſerving
the obedience of England, which was one of the richeſt jewels in the papal
crown. And he hoped, that theſe motives on both ſides would facilitate a
mutual agreement, and would forward the effects of his good offices.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS firſt prevailed on the pope to promiſe, that, if the
King would ſend a proxy to Rome, and thereby ſubmit his cauſe to the holy
ſee, he would appoint commiſſioners to meet at Cambray, and form the
proceſs; and he would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately afterwards pronounce the ſentence of
divorce, required of him. Bellay, biſhop of Paris, was next diſpatched to
London, and obtained a promiſe of the King, that he would ſubmit his
cauſe to the Roman conſiſtory, provided the cardinals of the imperial
faction were excluded from it. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1534</label> The prelate
carried this verbal promiſe to Rome; and the pope agreed, that, if the King
would ſign a written agreement to the ſame purpoſe, his demands ſhould
be fully complied with. 
<note place="margin">King's final breach with Rome.</note> A day
was appointed for the return of the meſſengers; and all the world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
this affair, which had threatened a violent rupture between England and the
Romiſh church, as drawing towards an amicable concluſion<note n="*" place="bottom">Father Paul, lib. 1.</note>. But the greateſt affairs often
depend on the moſt frivolous incidents. The courier, who carried the King's
written promiſe, was detained beyond the day appointed: News are brought to
Rome that a libel had been publiſhed in England againſt the court of Rome,
and a farce acted before the King in deriſion of the pope and cardinals<note n="†" place="bottom">Father Paul, lib. 1.</note>. 
<note place="margin">23d March.</note> The pope and cardinals enter
into the conſiſtory enflamed with anger; and by a precipitate ſentence,
the marriage of Henry and Catherine was pronounced valid, and Henry declared to
be excommunicated if he refuſed to adhere to it. Two days after, the courier
arrived; and Clement, who had been hurried from his uſual prudence, found,
that, tho' he repented heartily of this haſty meaſure, it would be
difficult for him to retract it, or replace affairs on the ſame footing as
before.</p>
               <p>IT is not probable, that the pope, had he conducted himſelf
with ever ſo great moderation and temper, could hope, during the life-time of
Henry, to have regained much authority or influence in England. That monarch
was both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0429000101:183"/> and obſtinate in his character;
and having proceeded ſo far in throwing off the papal yoke, he never could
again have been induced tamely to bend his neck to it. 
<note place="margin">15 January.</note> Even at the time, when he
was negotiating a reconcilement with Rome, he either entertained ſo little
hopes of ſucceſs, or was ſo indifferent about the event, that he had
aſſembled a Parliament; 
<note place="margin">A Parliament.</note> and continued to enact
laws totally deſtructive of the papal authority. The people had been prepared
by degrees for this great innovation. Each preceding ſeſſion had
retrenched ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the power and profit of the pontiff. Care had been
taken, during ſome years, to teach the nation, that a general council was
much ſuperior to the pope. But now a biſhop preached every Sunday at Paul's
Croſs, in order to inculcate the doctrine, that the pope was intitled to no
authority at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of his own dioceſe<note n="‡" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. 1. p. 144.</note>. The proceedings of the Parliament
ſhowed that they had entirely adopted this opinion; and there is reaſon to
believe, that the King, after having procured a favourable ſentence from
Rome, which would have removed all the doubts with regard to his ſecond
marriage and the ſucceſſion, might indeed have lived on terms of civility
with the apoſtolic ſee, but never would have ſurrendered to it any
conſiderable ſhare of his aſſumed prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. The nature and
importance of the laws, paſſed this ſeſſion, even before news arrived
of the violent reſolutions taken at Rome, is ſufficient to juſtify this
opinion.</p>
               <p>ALL payments made to the apoſtolic chamber; all proviſions,
bulls, diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were aboliſhed: Monaſteries were ſubjected to
the viſitation and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King alone: The law for puniſhing
heretics was moderated; the ordinary was prohibited to impriſon or try any
perſon upon ſuſpicion alone, without preſentment by two lawful
witneſſes; and it was declared, that to ſpeak againſt the pope's
authority was no hereſy: Biſhops were to be appointed, by a
<hi>congè d'elire</hi> from the crown, or in caſe of the dean and
chapter's refuſal, by letters patent; and no recourſe was to be had to Rome
for palls, bulls, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions: Campeggio and Ghinucci, two Italians, were
deprived of the biſhoprics of Saliſbury and Worceſter, which they had

Ang.</note>: The law which had been formerly made againſt paying annates or
firſt fruits, but which had been left in the King's power to ſuſpend or
inforce, was finally eſtabliſhed: And a ſubmiſſion, which was exacted
two years before from the clergy, and which had been obtained with great
difficulty, received this ſeſſion the ſanction of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament<note n="†" place="bottom">25. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſubmiſſion, the clergy acknowledge, that convocations ought only to be
aſſembled by the King's authority; they promiſe to enact no new canons
without his conſent; and they agree, that he ſhould appoint thirty-two
commiſſioners, in order to examine the old canons, and abrogate ſuch as

prerogative<note n="‡" place="bottom">Collier, vol. 2. p. 69, 70.</note>.
An appeal was alſo allowed from the biſhop's court to the King in
Chancery.</p>
               <p>BUT the moſt important law paſſed this ſeſſion, was
that which regulated the ſucceſſion to the crown: The marriage of the
King with Catherine was declared unlawful, void, and of no effect: The
primate's ſentence, annulling it, was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified: And the marriage with Queen
Anne was eſtabliſhed and confirmed. The crown was appointed to deſcend to
the iſſue of that marriage, and failing them to the King's heirs for ever.
An oath likewiſe was ordered to be taken in favour of this ſucceſſion,
under penalty of impriſonment during the King's pleaſure, and forfeiture of
goods and chattels. And all ſlander againſt the King, Queen, or their
iſſue, was ſubjected to the penalty of miſpriſion of treaſon. After
theſe compliances, the Parliament was prorogued; 
<note place="margin">30th March.</note> and thoſe acts, ſo
contemptuous towards the pope, and ſo deſtructive of his authority, were
paſſed at the very time that Clement pronounced his haſty ſentence
againſt the King. Henry's reſentment againſt Queen Catherine, on account
of her obſtinacy, was the reaſon why he excluded her daughter from all
hopes of ſucceeding to the crown; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his firſt intention, when he
began the ſuit of divorce, and of diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a ſecond
marriage.</p>
               <p>THE King found his eccleſiaſtical ſubjects as compliant as
the laity. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation ordered, that the act againſt appeals to Rome,
together with the King's appeal from the pope to a general council, ſhould be
affixed to the doors of all the churches in the kingdom: And they voted, that
the biſhop of Rome had, by the law of God, no more juriſdiction in England
than any other foreign biſhop; and that the authority, which he and his
predeceſſors had exerciſed there, was only by uſurpation and the
ſufferance of Engliſh princes. Four perſons only oppoſed this vote in
the lower houſe, and one doubted. It paſſed unanimouſly in the upper.
The biſhops went ſo far in their complaiſance, that they took out new
commiſſions from the crown, where all their ſpiritual and epiſcopal
authority was expreſsly affirmed to be derived ultimately from the civil
magiſtrate, and to be entirely dependent on his good pleaſure<note n="†" place="bottom">Collier's Eccl. Hiſt. vol. 2.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE oath regarding the ſucceſſion was generally ſworn
throughout the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Fiſher, biſhop of Rocheſter, and Sir Thomas
More, were the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of note, who entertained ſcruples with regard
to its legality. Fiſher was obnoxious on account of ſome practices, into
which his credulity, rather than any bad intentions, ſeems to have betrayed
him. But More was the perſon of greateſt reputation in the kingdom for
virtue and integrity; and as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0429000101:185"/> that his
authority would have influence on the ſentiments of others, great pains were
taken to convince him of the lawfulneſs of the oath. He declared, that he had
no ſcruple with regard to the ſucceſſion, and thought that the
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had full power to ſettle it: He offered to draw an oath
himſelf, which would aſſure his allegiance to the heir appointed; but he
refuſed the oath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by law; becauſe the preamble of that oath
aſſerted the legality of the King's marriage with Anne, and thereby
implied, that his former marriage with Catherine was unlawful and invalid.
Cranmer, the primate, and Cromwel, now ſecretary of ſtate, who highly loved
and eſteemed More, earneſtly ſollicited him to lay aſide his
ſcruples; and their friendly entreaties ſeemed to weigh more with him, than
all the penalties attending his refuſal<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol.
1. p. 156.</note>. He perſiſted however, in a mild, tho' firm manner, to
maintain his reſolution; and the King, irritated againſt him as well as
Fiſher, ordered them both to be indicted upon the ſlatute, and committed
priſoners to the Tower.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3d Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> THE Parliament, being
again aſſembled, conferred on the King the title of the only ſupreme
<hi>head</hi> on earth of the church of England; as they had already inveſted
him with all the real power belonging to it. In this memorable act, the
Parliament granted him power, or rather acknowledged his inherent power, 
<q rend="inline">"to viſit, and repreſs, redreſs, reform,
order, correct, reſtrain, or amend all errors, hereſies, abuſes,
offences, contempts and enormities, which fell under any ſpiritual authority
or juriſdiction<note n="†" place="bottom">26 H. 8. c. 1.</note>."</q>
They alſo declared it treaſon to attempt, imagine, or ſpeak evil
againſt the King, Queen, or his heirs, or to endeavour the depriving them of
their dignities or titles. They gave him a right to all the annates and tythes
of benefices, which had formerly been paid to the court of Rome. They granted
him a ſubſidy and a fifteenth. They attainted More and Fiſher for
miſpriſion of treaſon. And they united England and Wales together, by
giving to that principality all the benefit of the Engliſh laws.</p>
               <p>THUS the authority of the popes, like all exorbitant power, was
ruined by the exceſs of its acquiſitions, and by ſtretching its
pretenſions beyond what it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any human principles or
prepoſſeſſions to ſuſtain. The right of granting indulgences had in
former ages contributed extremely to enrich the holy ſee; but being openly
abuſed, ſerved to excite the firſt commotions and oppoſitions in
Germany. The prerogative of granting diſpenſations had alſo contributed
much to attach all the ſovereign princes and great families in Europe to the
papal authority; but meeting with an unlucky concurrence of circumſtances,
was now the cauſe, why England ſeparated herſelf from the Romiſh
communion. The acknowledgment of the King's ſupremacy introduced there a
greater ſimplicity into <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0429000101:186"/> the government, by uniting the
ſpiritual with the civil power, and preventing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about limits,
which never could be exactly determined between the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending parties. A way
was alſo prepared for checking the exorbitancy of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and
breaking thoſe ſhakles, by which all human reaſon, policy, and induſtry
had ſo long been incumbered. The prince, it may be ſuppoſed, being head
of the religion, as well as of the temporal juriſdiction of the kingdom, tho'
he might ſometimes employ the former as an engine of government, had no
intereſt, like the Roman pontiff, in nouriſhing its exceſſive growth;
and, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when blinded by ignorance or bigotry, would be ſure to retain it
within tolerable limits, and prevent its abuſes. And on the whole, there
followed from theſe revolutions very beneficial conſequences; tho' perhaps
neither foreſeen nor intended by the perſons who had the chief hand in
conducting them.</p>
               <p>WHILE Henry proceeded with ſo much order and tranquillity in
changing the antient religion, and while his authority ſeemed entirely
ſecure in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he was held in ſome inquietude by the ſtate of
affairs in Ireland and in Scotland.</p>
               <p>THE earl of Kildare was deputy of Ireland, under the duke of
Richmond, the King's natural ſon, who bore the title of lieutenant; and as
Kildare was accuſed of ſome violences againſt the family of Oſſory,
his hereditary enemy, he was called over to anſwer for his conduct. He left
his authority in the hands of his ſon, who hearing that his father was thrown
into priſon, and was in danger of his life, immediately took up arms, and
joining himſelf to Oneale, Ocarrol, and other Iriſh nobility, committed
many ravages, murdered Allen, archbiſhop of Dublin, and laid ſiege to that
city. Old Kildare mean-while died in priſon, and his ſon, perſevering in
his revolt, made applications to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, who promiſed him
aſſiſtance. The King was obliged to ſend over ſome forces to Ireland,
which ſo harraſſed the rebels, that Kildare, finding the emperor backward
in fulfilling his promiſes, was reduced to the neceſſity of
ſurrendering himſelf priſoner to lord Leonard Gray, the new deputy,
brother to the marquis of Dorſet. He was ſent over to England, together
with his five uncles; and after trial and conviction, they were all brought to
public juſtice; tho' two of the uncles, in order to ſave the family, had
pretended to join the King's party.</p>
               <p>THE earl of Angus had acquired the entire aſcendant in
Scotland, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got poſſeſſion of the King's perſon, then in
early youth, he was able, by means of that advantage, and by employing the
power of his own family, to retain the reins of government. The queen dowager,
however, his ſpouſe, bred him great diſturbance: For having ſeparated
herſelf from him, on account of ſome jealouſies and diſguſts, and
having procured a divorce, ſhe had married <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0429000101:187"/> another man
of quality of the name of Stuart; and ſhe joined all the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
nobility, who oppoſed Angus's authority. James himſelf was diſſatisfied
with the ſlavery, to which he was reduced; and by ſecret correſpondence,
he excited firſt Walter Scot, then the earl of Lenox, to attempt, by force of
arms, to free him from the hands of Angus. Both enterprizes failed of
ſucceſs; but James, impatient of reſtraint, found means at laſt of
flying to Stirling, where his mother then reſided; and having ſummoned all
the nobility to attend him, he overturned the authority of the Douglaſſes,
and obliged Angus and his brother to fly into England, where they were
protected by Henry. The King of Scotland, being now arrived at years of
majority, took the government into his own hands; and employed himſelf with
great ſpirit and valour, in repreſſing thoſe feuds, ravages, and
diſorders, which, tho' they diſturbed the courſe of public juſtice,
ſerved to ſupport the martial ſpirit of the Scotch, and contributed, by
that means, to maintain national independancy. He was deſirous of renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the antient league with the French nation; but finding Francis in cloſe union
with England, and on that account ſomewhat cold in hearkening to his
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, he received the more favourably the advances of the emperor, who
hoped, by means of ſuch an ally, to breed diſturbance to England. He
offered the Scotch King the choice of three princeſſes, his near relations,
and all of the name of Mary; his ſiſter the dowager of Hungary, his niece a
daughter of Portugal, or his couſin, the daughter of Henry; whom he pretended
to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of unknown to her father. James was more inclined to the latter
propoſal, had it not, upon reflection, been found impracticable; and his
natural propenſity to France at laſt prevailed over all other
conſiderations. The alliance with Francis neceſſarily engaged James to
agree to terms of peace with England. But tho' invited by his uncle, Henry, to
confer with him at Newcaſtle, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert common meaſures for
repreſſing the eccleſiaſtics in both kingdoms, and ſhaking off the
yoke of Rome, he could not be prevailed with to put himſelf in the King's
power. In order to have a pretext for refuſing the conference, he applied to
the pope, and obtained a brief, forbidding him to engage in any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
negotiations with an enemy of the holy ſee. By theſe meaſures, Henry
eaſily concluded, that he could very little depend on the friendſhip of his
nephew. But thoſe events took not place till ſome time after our preſent
period.</p>

THE antient and almoſt uninterrupted oppoſition of intereſt between the
laity and clergy in England, and between the Engliſh Clergy and the court of
Rome, had ſufficiently prepared the nation for a breach with the Roman
pontiff; and men had penetration enough to diſcover abuſes, which were
plainly calculated for the temporal advantages of the hierarchy, and which they
found deſtructive of their own. Theſe ſubjects ſeemed proportioned to
human under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and even the people, who felt the power of intere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t in their own breaſts, could
perceive the purpoſe of thoſe numerous inventions, which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
ſpirit of the ſovereign pontiff had introduced into religion. But when the
reformers proceeded thence to diſpute concerning the nature of the
ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the operations of grace, the terms of acceptance with the
dei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, men were thrown into
amazement, and were, during ſome time, at a loſs how to chuſe their
party. The profound ignorance, in which both the clergy and laity formerly
lived, and their freedom from theological altercations, had produced a
ſincere, but indolent acquieſcence in received opinions; and the multitude
were neither attached to them by topics of reaſoning, nor by thoſe
prejudices and antipathies againſt opponents, which have ever a more natural
and powerful influence over them. As ſoon as a new opinion therefore was
advanced, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by ſuch an authority as to call up their attention,
they felt their capacity totally unfitted for ſuch diſquiſitions; and
they perpetually fluctuated between the contending parties. Hence the ſudden
and violent movements by which the <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0429000101:189"/> people were agitated,
even in the moſt oppoſite directions: Hence their ſeeming proſtitution
in ſacrificing to preſent power the moſt ſacred principles: And hence
the rapid progreſs during ſome time, and the ſudden as well as entire
check given afterwards to the new doctrines. When men were once ſettled in
their particular ſects, and had fortified themſelves in a habitual
deteſtation againſt thoſe eſteemed heretics, they adhered with more
obſtinacy to the principles of their education; and the limits of the two
religions remained thenceforth fixed and unchangeable.</p>
               <p>NOTHING forwarded more the firſt progreſs of the reformers,
than the offer, which they made, of ſubmitting all religious doctrines to
private judgment, and the ſummons given every one to examine the principles
formerly impoſed upon him. Tho' the multitude were totally unqualified for
this undertaking, they yet were highly pleaſed with it. They fancied that
they were exerciſing their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; while they oppoſed to the prejudices
of ancient authority more powerful prejudices of another kind. The novelty
itſelf of the doctrines; the pleaſure of an imaginary triumph in diſpute;
the fervent zeal of the reformed preachers; their patience, and even alacrity,
in ſuffering perſecution, death, and torments; a diſguſt againſt the
reſtraints of the old religion; an indignation againſt the tyranny and
intereſted ſpirit of the eccleſiaſtics; theſe motives were prevalent
with the people, and by ſuch conſiderations were men ſo generally induced
during that age, to throw off the religion of their anceſtors.</p>
               <p>BUT in proportion as the practice of ſubmitting religion to
private judgment was acceptable to the people, it appeared, in ſome
reſpects, dangerous to the rights of ſovereigns, and ſeemed to deſtroy
that implicit obedience on which the authority of the civil magiſtrate is
chiefly founded. The very precedent of ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an ancient and deep
founded eſtabliſhment as that of the Roman hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy might, it was
apprehended, prepare the way for new innovations. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican ſpirit,
which naturally took place among the reformers, increaſed this jealouſy.
The furious inſurrections of the populace, excited by Muncer and other
anabaptiſts in Germany<note n="*" place="bottom">Sleidan, lib. 4. &amp;
5.</note>, furniſhed a new pretence for decrying the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Nor
ſhould we conclude, becauſe proteſtants in our time prove as dutiful
ſubjects as thoſe of any other religion, that therefore ſuch
apprehenſions were altogether without any appearance or plauſibility. Tho'
the liberty of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate judgment be tendered to the diſciples of the
reformation, it is not in reality accepted of; and men are generally contented
to acquieſce in thoſe eſtabliſhments, however new, into which their
early education has thrown them.</p>

<note place="margin">Of the King.</note> But beſides this
political jealouſy, there was another reaſon which inſpired this
imperious monarch with an averſion to the reformers. He had early declared
his ſentiments againſt Luther; and having entered the liſts in thoſe
ſcholaſtic quarrels, he had received, from his courtiers and theologians,
infinite applauſe for his performance. Elated by this imaginary ſucceſs,
and blinded by a natural arrogance and obſtinacy of temper, he had
entertained the moſt lofty opinion of his own erudition, and he received with
impatience, mixed with contempt, any contradiction to his ſentiments. Luther
alſo had been ſo imprudent, as to treat in a very indecent manner his royal
antagoniſt; and tho' he afterwards made the humbleſt ſubmiſſions to
Henry, and apologized for the vehemence of his former expreſſions, he never
could efface the hatred which the King had conceived againſt him and his
doctrines. The idea of hereſy ſtill appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deteſtable as well as
formidable to that prince; and whilſt his reſentment againſt the ſee of
Rome had removed one conſiderable part of his early prejudices, he had made
it a point of honour never to relinquiſh the reſt. Separate as he ſtood
from the catholic church, and from the Roman pontiff, the head of it, he
ſtill valued himſelf on maintaining the catholic doctrine, and on guarding,
by fire and ſword, the imagined purity of his ſpeculative principles.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> HENRY'S
miniſters and courtiers were of as motley a character as his conduct; and
ſeemed to waver, during this whole reign, between the ancient and the new
religion. The Queen, engaged by intereſt as well as inclination, favoured the
cauſe of the reformers: Cromwel, who was created ſecretary of ſtate, and
who was every day advancing in the King's confidence, had embraced the ſame
views; and as he was a man of prudence and ability, he was able, very
effectually, tho' in a covert manner, to promote the late innovations: Cranmer,
archbiſhop of Canterbury, had ſecretly adopted the proteſtant tenets; and
he had gained Henry's friendſhip by his candour and ſincerity; virtues
which he poſſeſſed in as eminent a degree as thoſe times, equally
diſtracted with faction and oppreſſed with tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, could eaſily
permit. On the other hand, the duke of Norfolk adhered to <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0429000101:191"/> the ancient faith; and by the greatneſs of his rank, as well as by
his talents, both for peace and war, he had great weight in the King's council:
Gardiner, lately created biſhop of Wincheſter, had inliſted himſelf in
the ſame party; and the ſuppleneſs of his character, as well as the
dexterity of his conduct, had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him extremely uſeful to it.</p>
               <p>ALL theſe miniſters, while they ſtood in the moſt
irreconcilable oppoſition of principles, were obliged to diſguiſe their
particular opinions, and to pretend an entire agreement with the ſentiments
of their maſter. Cromwel and Cranmer ſtill carried the appearance of a
conformity to the ancient ſpeculative tenets; but they artfully made uſe of
Henry's reſentment to widen the breach with the ſee of Rome. Norfolk and
Gardiner feigned an aſſent to the King's ſupremacy, and to his
renounciation of the ſovereign pontiff; but they encouraged his paſſion
for the catholic faith, and inſtigated him to puniſh thoſe daring
heretics, who had preſumed to reject his theological principles. Both ſides
hoped, by their unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited compliance, to bring him over to their party: The
King mean while, who held the ballance between the factions, was enabled, by
the courtſhip payed him both by proteſtants and catholics, to aſſume an
immeaſurable authority: And tho' in all theſe meaſures he was really
driven by his ungoverned humour, he caſually held a courſe, which led more
certainly to arbitrary power, than any which the moſt profound politics could
have traced out to him. Artifice, refinement, and hypocriſy, in his
ſituation, would have put both parties on their guard againſt him, and
would have taught them reſerve in complying with a monarch, whom they could
never hope thoroughly to have gained: But while the frankneſs, ſincerity,
and openneſs of Henry's temper were generally known, as well as the dominion
of his furious paſſions; each ſide dreaded to loſe him by the
ſmalleſt oppoſition, and flattered themſelves that a blind compliance
with his will, would throw him, cordially and fully, into their
intereſts.</p>
               <p>THE ambiguity of the King's conduct, tho' it kept the courtiers
in awe, ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to encourage the proteſtant doctrine among his ſubjects,
and promoted that ſpirit of innovation with which the age was generally
ſeized, and which nothing but an entire uniformity, as well as a ſteddy
ſeverity in the adminiſtration, could be able to repreſs. There were
ſome Engliſhmen, Tindal, Joye, Conſtantine, and others, who, dreading the
exertion of the King's authority, had fled to Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp<note n="‡" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. I. p. 159.</note>; where the great privileges

they did not exclude from this appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation the ſocial virtues, it was
ſtill the ſuperſtitions, gainful to the church, which they chiefly
extolled and recommended. The books, compoſed by theſe fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, being
ſtole over to England, began to make converts every where; but it was a
tranſlation of the ſcriptures by Tindal, that was eſteemed moſt
dangerous to the eſtabliſhed faith. The firſt edition of this work,
compoſed with little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy, was found liable to conſiderable
objections; and Tindal, who was poor, and could not afford to loſe a great
part of the impreſſion, was longing for an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of correcting his
errors, of which he had been made ſenſible. Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal, then biſhop of

diſcourage, in the gentleſt manner, theſe innovations, gave private
orders for buying up all the copies, which could be found at Antwerp; and he
burnt them publicly in Cheapſide. By this contrivance, he ſupplied Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
with money, enabled him to print a new and correct edition of his work, and
gave occaſion to great ſcandal and reproach, in thus committing to the
flames the word of God<note n="†" place="bottom">Hall, fol. 186. Fox, vol.

               <p>THE diſciples of the reformation met with little ſeverity
during the miniſtry of Wolſey, who, tho' himſelf a clergyman, bore too
ſmall regard to the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical order, to ſerve as an inſtrument
of their tyranny: It was even an article of impeachment againſt him<note n="‡" place="bottom">Articles of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Herbert. Burnet.</note>,
that by his connivance he had encouraged the growth of hereſy, and that he
had protected and acquitted ſome notorious offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. 
<note place="margin">Sir Thomas More.</note> Sir Thomas More, who
ſucceeded Wolſey as chancellor, is at once an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject deſerving our
compaſſion, and an inſtance of the uſual progreſs of men's
ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents during that age. This man, whoſe elegant genius and familiar
acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the noble ſpirit of antiquity, had given him very enlarged
ſentiments, and who had in his early years advanced principles, which even at
preſent would <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0429000101:193"/> be eſteemed ſomewhat libertine, had,
in the courſe of events, been ſo irritated by polemics, and thrown into
ſuch a ſuperſtitious attachment to the ancient faith, that few
inquiſitors have been guilty of greater violence in their proſecutions of
hereſy. Tho' adorned with the gentleſt manners, and the pureſt integrity,
he carried to the utmoſt height his averſion to heterodoxy; and one James
Bain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, in particular, a gentleman of the temple, experienced from him the
high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſeverity. Bainham, accuſed of favouring the new opinions, was
carried to More's houſe, and having refuſed to diſcover his accomplices,
the chancellor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to be whipt in his preſence, and afterwards
ſent him to the Tower, where he himſelf ſaw him put to the torture. The
unhappy gentleman, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by all theſe ſeverities, abjured his opinions;
but feeling afterwards the deepeſt compunction for this apoſtacy, he openly
returned to his former tenets, and even courted the crown of martyrdom. He was
condemned as an obſtinate and relapſed heretic, and was burned in
Smithfield<note n="*" place="bottom">Fox. Burnet, vol. I. p. 165.</note>.</p>
               <p>MANY were brought into the biſhops courts for offences, which
appear very trivial, but which were regarded as ſymbols of the party: Some
for teaching their children the Lord's prayer in Engliſh; others for reading
the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that language, or for ſpeaking againſt pilgrimages.
To harbour the perſecuted preachers, to neglect the faſts of the church, to
declaim againſt the vices of the clergy, were capital offences. One Thomas
Bilney, a prieſt, who had embraced the new doctrine, had been terrified into
an abjuration; but was ſo haunted by remorſe, that his friends dreaded
ſome fatal effects of his deſpair. At laſt, his mind ſeemed to be more
compoſed; but this appearing calm pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded only from the reſolution which
he had taken, of expiating his paſt offence, by an open confeſſion of the
truth, and by dying a martyr to it. He went thro' Norfolk, teaching every where
the people to beware of idolatry, and of truſting either to pilgrimages, or
to the cowle of St. Francis, to the prayers of the ſaints, or to images. He
was ſoon ſeized, tried in the biſhop's court, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a
relapſe; and the writ was ſent down to burn him. When brought to the
ſtake, he diſcovered ſuch patience, fortitude, and devotion, that the
ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were much affected with the horrors of his puniſhment; and
ſome mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant friars, who were preſent, fearing that his death would be
imputed to them, and make them loſe thoſe alms, which they received from
the charity of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, deſired him publicly to acquit them<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 164.</note>of having any hand in his death.
He very willingly complied; and by this meekneſs gained the more on the
ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shy of the people. Another perſon, ſtill more heroic, being brought
to the ſtake for denying the real preſence, ſeemed almoſt in a
tranſport of joy; and he <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0429000101:194"/> tenderly embraced the
faggots, which were to be the inſtruments of his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the means
of procuring him eternal reſt. In ſhort, the tide turning towards the new
doctrine, thoſe ſevere executions, which, in another diſpoſition of
men's minds, would have ſufficed to ſuppreſs it, now ſerved only the
more to diffuſe it among the people, and to inſpire them with horror
againſt the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting perſecutors.</p>
               <p>BUT tho' Henry neglected not to puniſh the proteſtant
doctrine, which he eſteemed hereſy, his moſt formidable enemies, he knew,
were the zealous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents to the ancient religion, chiefly the monks, who,
having their immediate dependance on the Roman pontiff, apprehended their own
ruin to be the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conſequence of aboliſhing his authority in England.
Peyto, a friar, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the King, had the aſſurance to tell him, 
<q rend="inline">"That many lying prophets had deceived him, but
he, as a true Micajah, warned him, that the dogs would lick his blood, as they
had done Ahab's<note n="‡" place="bottom">Strype, vol. I. p.

preacher to depart in peace. Next Sunday, he employed Dr. Corren to preach
before him; who juſtified the King's proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and gave Peyto the
appellations of a rebel, a ſlanderer, a dog, and a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Elſton,
another friar of the ſame houſe, interrupted the preacher; and told him,
that he was one of the lying prophets, who ſought by adultery to
eſtabliſh the ſucceſſion to the crown; but that he himſelf would
juſtify all that Peyto had ſaid. Henry ſilenced this petulant friar; but
ſhowed no other mark of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than ordering Peyto and him to be
ſummoned before the council, and to be rebuked for their offence<note n="†" place="bottom">Collier, vol. II. p. 86. Burnet, vol. I. p.
151.</note>. He even bore patiently ſome new inſtances of their obſtinacy
and arrogance. For when the earl of Eſſex, a privy counſellor, told them,
that they deſerved for their offence to be thrown into the Thames; Elſton
replied, that the road to heaven lay as near by water as by land<note n="‖" place="bottom">Stow, p. 562.</note>.</p>
               <p>BUT ſeveral monks were detected in a conſpiracy, which, as
it might have proved more dangerous to the King, was attended with more fatal
conſequences to themſelves. 
<note place="margin">The Maid of Kent.</note> Elizabeth Barton, of
Aldington in Kent, commonly called the <hi>holy Maid of Kent,</hi> had been
ſubject to hyſterical fits, which threw her body into unuſual
convulſions; and having produced an equal diſorder in her mind, made her
utter ſtrange ſayings, which, as ſhe was ſcarce conſcious of them
during the time, had ſoon after entirely eſcaped her memory. The ſilly
people in the neighbourhood were ſtruck with theſe appearances, which they
imagined to be ſupernatural; and Richard Maſters, vicar of the pariſh, a
deſigning fellow, <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0429000101:195"/> founded on them a project, by which
he hoped to draw both profit and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himſelf. He went to
Warham, Archbiſhop of Canterbury, who was at that time alive; and having
given him an account of Elizabeth's revelations, he ſo far wrought on that
prudent, but ſuperſtitious prelate, as to receive orders from him to watch
her in her-trances, and to note down carefully all her future ſpeeches. The
regard paid her by a perſon of ſo high a rank, ſoon rendered her ſtill
more the object of attention to the neighbourhood; and it was eaſy for
Maſters to perſuade them, as well as the maid herſelf, that her ravings
were inſpirations of the Holy Ghoſt. Knavery, as is uſual, ſoon after
ſucceeding to illuſion, ſhe learned to counterfeit trances; and ſhe
then uttered, in an unuſual tone of voice, ſuch ſpeeches as were dictated
to her by her ſpiritual director. Maſters aſſociated with him Dr.
Bocking, a canon of Canterbury; and their deſign was to raiſe the credit of
an image of the virgin, which ſtood in a chapel belonging to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and
to draw ſuch pilgrimages to it as uſually frequented the more famous images
and relicts. In proſecution of this deſign, Elizabeth pretended
revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which directed her to have recourſe to that image for a cure;
and being brought before it, in the preſence of a great multitude, ſhe fell
anew into convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and after diſtorting her limbs and countenance
during a competent time, ſhe affected to have obtained a perfect recovery by
the interceſſion of the virgin<note n="*" place="bottom">Stowe, p. 570.
Blanquet's Epitome of chronicles.</note>. This miracle was ſoon bruited
abroad; and the two prieſts, finding the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſucceed beyond
their own expectations, began to extend their views, and to lay the foundation
of more important enterprizes. They taught their peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to declaim againſt
the new doctrines, which ſhe denominated hereſy; againſt innovations in
eccleſiaſtical government; and againſt the King's divorce from Catherine.
She went ſo far as to aſſert, that, if he proſecuted that deſign, and
married another, he would not be a King a month longer, and would not an hour
longer poſſeſs the favour of the Almighty, but ſhould die the death of
a villain. Many monks throughout England, either from folly, or roguery, or
from faction, which is often a complication of both, entered into this
deluſion; and one Deering, a friar, wrote a book of the revelations and
prophecies of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth<note n="†" place="bottom">Strype, vol I. p.
181.</note>. Miracles were daily added, to encreaſe the wonder; and the
pulpit every where reſounded with accounts of the ſanctity and
inſpirations of this new propheteſs. Meſſages were carried from her to
Queen Catherine, by which that princeſs was exhorted to perſiſt in her
oppoſition to the divorce; the pope's am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors gave encouragement to
the popular credulity; and even Fiſher, biſhop of Rocheſter, tho' a man
of ſenſe and learning, was carried away with an opinion 
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0429000101:196"/> ſo favourable to the party, which he had embraced<note n="‡" place="bottom">Collier, vol. II. p. 87.</note>. The King at laſt
began to think the matter worthy of his attention; and having ordered Elizabeth
and her accomplices to be arreſted, he brought them before the
ſtar-chamber, where they freely, without being put to the torture, made
confeſſion of their guilt. The Parliament, in the ſeſſion held the
beginning of this year, paſſed an act of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder againſt ſome who
were engaged in this treaſonable impoſture<note n="*" place="bottom">25 Hen.

herſelf, Maſters, Bocking, Deering, Rich, Riſby, Gold, ſuffered for
their crime. The biſhop of Rocheſter, Abel, Addiſon, Laurence, and ſome
others, were condemned for miſpriſion of treaſon; becauſe they had not
diſcovered ſome cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal ſpeeches which they heard from Elizabeth<note n="†" place="bottom">Godwin's Annals, p. 53.</note>: And they were thrown into
priſon. The better to undeceive the multitude, the forgery of many of the
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſs's miracles was detected; and even the ſcandalous proſtitution
of her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners was laid open to the public. Thoſe paſſions, which ſo
naturally inſinuate themſelves amidſt the warm intimacies maintained by
the devotees of different ſexes, had taken place between Elizabeth and her
confederates; and it was found, that a door to her dormitory, which was ſaid
to have been miraculouſly opened, in order to give her acceſs to the
chapel, for the ſake of frequent converſe with heaven, had been contrived
by Bocking and Maſters for leſs refined purpoſes.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1535</label> THE detection of an
impoſture, attended with ſo many odious circumſtances, hurt much the
credit of the eccleſiaſtics, particularly of the monks, and inſtigated
the King to take vengeance on them. He ſuppreſſed three monaſteries of
the Obſervantine friars; and finding that little clamor was excited by this
act of power, he was the more encouraged to lay his rapacious hands on the
reſt. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, he exerciſed puniſhment on individuals, who were
obnoxious to him. The Parliament had made it treaſon to endeavour the
depriving the King of his dignity or titles: They had lately added to his other
titles, that of ſupreme head of the church: It was inferred, that to deny his
ſupremacy was treaſon; and many priors and eccleſiaſtics loſt their
lives for this new ſpecies of crime. It was certainly a high inſtance of
tyranny to make the mere delivery of a political opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, eſpecially one
that no way affected the King's temporal right, to be a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal offence, tho'
attended with no overt act; and the Parliament, in paſſing this law, had
overlooked all the principles by which a civilized, much more a free people,
ſhould be governed: But the violence of changing ſo ſuddenly the whole
ſyſtem of government, and the making it treaſon to deny what, during many
ages, it had been hereſy to aſſert, is an event which may appear
ſomewhat extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary. Even the ſtern, unrelenting mind of Henry was, at
firſt, ſhocked <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0429000101:197"/> with theſe ſanguinary meaſures;
and he went ſo far as to change his garb and dreſs, pretending ſorrow for
the neceſſity, by which he was puſhed to ſuch extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Still
impelled, however, by his violent temper, and deſirous of ſtriking a terror

violent inclinations. But More could never be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on, contrary to his
principles, to acknowledge the King's ſupremacy; and tho' Henry exacted that
compliance from the whole nation, there was, as yet, no law obliging any one to
take an oath to that purpoſe. Rich, the ſollicitor general, was ſent to
confer with More, then a priſoner, who kept a cautious ſilence with regard
to the ſupremacy: He was only inveigled to ſay, that any queſtion with
regard to the law, which eſtabliſhed that prerogative, was like a two-edged
ſword: If a perſon anſwer one way, it will confound his ſoul; if
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it will deſtroy his body. No more was wanted to found an indictment
of high treaſon againſt the priſoner. His ſilence was called malicious,
and made a part of his crime; and theſe words, which had caſually dropped
from him, <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0429000101:198"/> were interpreted as a denial of the
ſupremacy<note n="*" place="bottom">More's Life of Sir Thomas More. Herbert, p.

ſentence againſt More, who had long expected this fate, and who needed no
preparation to fortify him againſt the terrors of death. Not only his
conſtancy, but even his cheerfulneſs, nay, his uſual face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs,
never forſook him; and he made a ſacrifice of his life to his integrity
with the ſame indifference that he maintained in any ordinary occurrence.

               <p>WHEN the execution of Fiſher and More was reported at Rome,
eſpecially that of the former, who was inveſted with the dignity of
cardinal, every one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the moſt violent rage againſt the King;
and numerous libels were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, by the wits and orators of Italy,
comparing him to Caligula, Nero, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian, and all the moſt unrelenting
tyrants of antiquity. Clement the ſeventh had died about ſix months after
he pronounced ſentence againſt the King; and Paul the third, of the name of
Farneſe, had ſucceeded to the papal throne. This pontiff, who had always
favoured Henry's cauſe while a cardinal, had hoped, that, perſonal
animoſities being buried with his predeceſſors, it might not be
impoſſible to form an agreement with England: And Henry himſelf was ſo
deſirous of accommodating matters, that in a negotiation, which he entered
into with Francis a little before this time, he required, that that monarch
ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate a friendſhip between him and the court of Rome. But
Henry was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to preſcribe, not to receive terms; and even while he
was negotiating peace, his uſual violence often carried him to commit
offences, which rendered the quarrel totally incurable. 
<note place="margin">30th Auguſt.</note> The execution of
Fiſher was regarded by Paul, as ſo capital an injury, that he immediately
paſſed cenſures againſt the King, citing him and all his adherents to
appear in Rome within ninety days, in order to anſwer for their crimes: 
<note place="margin">King excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</note> If they failed,

the nobility to take arms againſt him; freed <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0429000101:199"/> his
ſubjects from all oaths of allegiance; cut off their commerce with foreign
ſtates; and declared it lawful for any one to ſeize them, to make ſlaves
of their perſons, and to convert their effects to their own uſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Sanders, p. 148.</note>. But tho' theſe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were
paſſed, they were not at that time openly denounced: The pope delayed the
publication, till he ſhould find an agreement with England entirely
deſperate; and till the emperor, who was at preſent preſſed by the
Turks and the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant princes in Germany, ſhould be in a condition to
execute the cenſures.</p>
               <p>THE King knew, that he might expect any injury, which it
ſhould be in Charles's power to inflict; and he therefore made it the chief
object of his policy to incapacitate that monarch from wreaking his
reſentment upon him<note n="†" place="bottom">Herbert, p. 350,
351.</note>. He renewed his friendſhip with Francis, and opened negotiations
for marrying his infant-daughter, Elizabeth, with the duke of Angouleme, third
ſon of Francis. Theſe two princes alſo made advances to the proteſtant
league in Germany, who were ever jealous of the emperor's ambition: And Henry,
beſides remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſome money, ſent Fox, biſhop of Hereford, as
Francis did Bellay, lord of Langey, to treat with thoſe princes. But during
the firſt fervours of the reformation, an agreement in theological tenets was
held, as well as an union of intereſt, to be eſſential to a good
correſpondence among ſtates; and tho' both Francis and Henry flattered the
German princes with hopes of their embracing the confeſſion of Auſbourg,
it was looked upon as a bad ſymptom of their ſincerity, that they
exerciſed ſuch extreme rigour againſt all preachers of the reformation in
their reſpective dominions<note n="‡" place="bottom">Sleidan, lib.
10.</note>. Henry carried the feint ſo far, that, while he thought himſelf
the firſt theologian in the world, he yet invited over Melancthon, Bucer,
Sturmius, Draco, and other German divines, in order to confer with him, and to
inſtruct him in the foundation of their tenets. Theſe theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were now
of great importance in the world; and no poet or philoſopher, even in antient
Greece, where they were treated with moſt reſpect, had ever reached equal
applauſe and admiration with theſe wretched compoſers of meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical
polemics. The German princes told the King, that they could not ſpare their
divines; and as Henry had no hopes of agreement with ſuch zealous
diſputants, and knew that in Germany the followers of Luther would not
aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate with the diſciples of Zuinglius, becauſe, tho' they agreed
in every thing elſe, they differed in ſome particulars with regard to the
euchariſt, he was the more indifferent on account of this refuſal. He could

Francis <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0429000101:200"/> and that monarch was ſo inveterate, that he

incident happened in England, which promiſed a more amicable concluſion of

told him, that as the hour of her death was now approaching, ſhe laid hold of
this laſt opportunity to inculcate on him the importance of his religious
duty, and the comparative emptineſs of all human grandeur and enjoyment: That
tho' his fondneſs towards theſe periſhing advantages had thrown her into

forgave him all paſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and hoped that this pardon would be ratified

               <p>THE emperor thought, that as the deceaſe of his aunt had
removed all foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for perſonal animoſity between him and Henry, it
might not now be impoſſible to detach him from the alliance of France, and
renew that confederacy with England from which he had formerly reaped ſo much
advantage. He ſent Henry propoſals for a return to ancient amity, upon
theſe conditions<note n="‡" place="bottom">Du Bellay, liv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.
Herbert. Burnet, vol. 3. in Coll. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 50.</note>; that he ſhould be
reconciled to the pope, that he ſhould aſſiſt him in his war with the
Turk, and that he ſhould take party with him againſt Francis, who now
threatened the dutchy of Milan. The King replied, that he was willing to be on
good terms with the emperor, provided he would acknowledge, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
breach of friendſhip came entirely from himſelf: As to the conditions
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; the proceedings againſt the biſhop of Rome were ſo juſt,
and ſo fully ratified by the Parliament of England, that they could not now
be revoked; when chriſtian princes ſhould have ſettled peace among
themſelves, he would <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0429000101:201"/> not fail exert that vigour, which
became him, againſt the enemies of the faith; and after amity with the
emperor was once fully reſtored, he would then be in a ſituation, as a
common friend both to him and Francis, either to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate an agreement between
them, or to aſſiſt the injured party.</p>
               <p>WHAT rendered Henry more indifferent to the advances made by the
emperor, was his experience of the uſual duplicity and inſincerity of that
monarch, and the intelligence which he received of the preſent tranſactions
in Europe. Francis Sforza, duke of Milan, was dead without iſſue; and the
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror maintained, that the dutchy, being a fief of the empire, was devolved
to him, as the head of the Germanic body: Not to give umbrage, however, to the
ſtates of Italy, he profeſſed his intention of beſtowing that
principality on ſome prince, who ſhould be obnoxious to no party, and he
even made offer of it to the duke of Angouleme, third ſon to Francis. The
French monarch, who pretended that his own right to Milan was now revived upon
Sforza's death, was contented to ſubſtitute his ſecond ſon, the duke of
Orleans, in his place; and the emperor pretended to cloſe with this
propoſal. But his ſole intention in that liberal conceſſion was to gain
time, till he ſhould put himſelf in a warlike poſture, and be able to
carry an invaſion into Francis's dominions. The antient enmity between
theſe princes broke out anew in bravadoes, and in perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults on
each other, not becoming perſons of their rank, and ſtill leſs ſuitable
to men of ſuch unqueſtioned bravery. Charles ſoon after invaded Provence
in perſon, with an army of fifty thouſand men; but met with no ſucceſs.
His army periſhed with ſickneſs, fatigue, famine, and other
diſaſters; and he was obliged to raiſe the ſiege of Marſeilles, and
retire into Italy with the broken re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of his forces. An army of
imperialiſts, near 30,000 ſtrong, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded France on the ſide of
the Netherlands, and laid ſiege to Peronne, made no greater progreſs, but
retired upon the approach of a French army. And Henry had thus the
ſatisfaction to find, both that his ally, Francis, was likely to ſupport
himſelf without foreign aſſiſtance, and that his own tranquillity was
fully enſured by theſe violent wars and animoſities on the continent.</p>
               <p>IF any inquietude remained with the Engliſh court, it was
ſolely occaſioned by the ſtate of affairs in Scotland. James, hearing of
the diſtreſſed ſituation of his ally, Francis, very generouſly levied
ſome forces; and embarking them on board veſſels, which he had hired for
that purpoſe, landed them ſafely in France. He even came over in perſon;
and making haſte to join the French King's camp, which then lay in Provence,
and to partake of his danger, he met that prince at Lyons, who, having
repulſed the emperor's invaſion, was now return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his capital.
Recommended by ſo agreeable and ſeaſonable an inſtance of 
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0429000101:202"/> friendſhip, the King of Scots made ſuit to Magdalen,
daughter to the French monarch, who had no other ſcruple in agreeing to the
match, than what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the infirm ſtate of his daughter's health,
which ſeemed to threaten her with an approaching end. But James having gained
the affections of the princeſs, and obtained her conſent, the father would
no longer oppoſe the united deſires of his daughter and friend; and they
were accordingly married, and ſoon after ſet ſail for Scotland, where the
young Queen, as was foreſeen, died in a little time after her arrival.
Francis, however, was afraid, leſt his ally, Henry, whom he likewiſe looked
on as his friend, and who lived with him on a more cordial footing than is
uſual among great princes, ſhould be diſpleaſed that this cloſe
confederacy between France and Scotland was concluded without his
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation. He therefore diſpatched Pommeraye to London, in order to
apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize for this meaſure; but Henry, with his uſual openneſs and
freedom, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſuch diſpleaſure, that he refuſed even to
confer with the ambaſſador; and Francis was apprehenſive of a rupture
with a prince, who regulated his meaſures more by humour and paſſion than
by the rules of political prudence. But Henry was ſo fettered by the
oppoſition, in which he was engaged againſt the pope and the emperor, that
he purſued no farther this diſguſt againſt Francis; and in the end
every thing remained in tranquillity both on the ſide of France and
Scotland.</p>
               <p>THE domeſtic peace of England ſeemed to be expoſed to more
hazard, by the violent innovations in religion; and it may be affirmed, that,
in this dangerous conjuncture, nothing enſured public tranquillity ſo much
as the deciſive authority acquired by the King, and his great aſcendant
over all his ſubjects. Not only the devotion paid the crown, was profound
during that age: The perſonal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, inſpired by Henry, was
conſiderable; and even the terrors, with which he over-awed every one, were
not attended with any conſiderable degree of hatred. His frankneſs, his
ſincerity, his magnificence, his generoſity, were vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which
counterballanced his violence, cruelty, and impetuoſity. And the important
rank, which his vigour, more than addreſs, acquired him in all foreign
negotiations, flattered the vanity of Engliſhmen, and made them the more
willingly endure thoſe domeſtic hardſhips, to which they were expoſed.
The King, conſcious of his advantages, was now proceeding to the moſt
dangerous trial of his authority; and after paving the way for that meaſure
by ſeveral expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, he was at laſt determined to ſuppreſs the
monaſteries, and to put himſelf in poſſeſſion of their ample
revenues.</p>
               <p>THE great encreaſe of monaſteries, if matters be
conſidered merely in a politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal light, will appear the radical
inconvenience of the catholic religion; and every <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0429000101:203"/> other
diſadvantage, attending that communion, ſeems to have an inſeparable
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with theſe religious inſtitutions. Papal uſurpations, the
tyranny of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, the multiplication of holidays; all theſe
letters on liberty and induſtry, were ultimately derived from the authority
and inſinuation of monks, who being ſcattered every where, proved ſo many
colonies of ſuperſtition and of folly. This order of men were extremely
enraged againſt Henry; and regarded the abolition of the papal authority in
England, as the removal of the ſole protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they enjoyed againſt
the rapacity of the crown and of the courtiers. They were now ſubjected to
the King's viſitation; the ſuppoſed ſacredneſs of their bulls from
Rome was rejected; the progreſs of the reformation abroad, which had every
where been attended with the abolition of the monaſtic ſtate, gave them
reaſon to expect like conſequences in England; and tho' the King ſtill
maintained the ancient doctrine of purgatory, to which moſt of the convents
owed their origin and ſupport, it was foreſeen, that, in the progreſs of
the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, he would every day be led to depart wider from antient
inſtitutions, and be drawn nearer the tenets of the reformers, with whom his
political intereſts natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally induced him to ally himſelf. Moved by
theſe conſiderations, the friars made uſe of all their influence to
enflame the people againſt the King's government; and Henry, finding their
ſafety irreconcilable with his own, was determined to ſeize the preſent
opportunity, and utterly deſtroy his declared enemies.</p>
               <p>CROMWEL, ſecretary of ſtate, had been appointed
vicar-general, or vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, a new office, by which the King's ſupremacy,
or the abſolute, uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able power aſſumed over the church, was
delegated to him. He employed Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, London, Price, Gage, Petre, Bellaſis,
and others, as commiſſioners, who carried on, every where, a rigorous
enquiry with regard to the conduct and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of all the friars. During
times of faction, eſpecially of the religious kind, no equity is to be
expected from adverſaries; and as it was known, that the King's intention in
this viſitation, was to find a pretence for aboliſhing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, we
may naturally conclude, that the reports of the commiſſioners are very
little to be relied on. Friars were encouraged to bring in informations
againſt their brethren; the ſlighteſt evidence was credited; and even the
calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſpread abroad by the friends to the reformation, were regarded as
grounds of proof. Monſtrous diſorders are therefore ſaid to have been
found in many of the religious houſes: Whole convents of women abandoned to
lewdneſs: Signs of abortions procured, of infants murdered, of unnatural
luſts between perſons of the ſame ſex. It is indeed probable, that the
blind ſubmiſſion of the people, during thoſe ages, would render the
friars and nuns more unguarded, and more diſſolute, than they are in any
roman catholic country at preſent: But ſtill, the <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0429000101:204"/>
reproaches, which it is ſafeſt to credit, are ſuch as point at vices,
naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the very inſtitution of convents, and with the
monaſtic life. The cruel and inveterate factions and quarrels therefore which
the commiſſioners mentioned, are very credible, among men, who, being
confined together within the ſame walls, never can forget their mutual
animoſities, and who, being cut off from all the moſt endearing connections
of nature, are commonly curſed with hearts more ſelfiſh, and tempers more
unrelenting, than fall to the ſhare of other men. The pious frauds,
practiſed to increaſe the devotion and liberality of the people, may be
regarded as certain, in an order founded on illuſions, lies, and
ſuperſtition. The ſupine idleneſs, alſo, and its attendant, profound
ignorance, with which the convents were reproached, admit of no queſtion; and
tho' monks were the true preſervers, as well as inventors, of the dreaming
and captious philoſophy of the ſchools, no manly or elegant knowledge could
be expected among men, whoſe life, condemned to a tedious uniformity, and
deprived of all emulation, afforded nothing to raiſe the mind, or cultivate
the genius.</p>
               <p>SOME few monaſteries, terrified with this rigorous
inquiſition carried on by Cromwel and his commiſſioners, ſurrendered
their revenues into the King's hands; and the monks received ſmall penſions
as the reward of their obſequiouſneſs. Orders were given to diſmiſs
ſuch nuns and friars as were below four and twenty, and whoſe vows were, on
that account, ſuppoſed not to be binding. The doors of the convents were
opened, even to ſuch as were above that age; and all thoſe recovered their
liberty who deſired it. But as all theſe expedients did not fully anſwer
the King's purpoſe, he had recourſe to his uſual inſtrument of power,
the Parliament; and in order to prepare men for the innovations projected, the
report of the viſitors was publiſhed, and a general horror was endeavoured
to be excited in the nation againſt inſtitutions which, to their
anceſtors, had been the objects of the moſt profound veneration.</p>

univerſal ſalvation, had publiſhed that ſalutary doctrine to all
nations: That if this practice was not very abſurd, the artifice at leaſt
was very barefaced, and proved a conſciouſneſs, that the gloſſes and
traditions of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ſtood in direct oppoſition to the original text,
dictated by Supreme Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: That it was now neceſſary for the
people, ſo long abuſed by intereſted pretenſions, to ſee with their
own eyes, and to examine whether the claims of the eccleſiaſtics were
founded on that charter, which was on all hands acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be derived
from heaven: And that as a ſpirit of reſearch and curioſity was happily
revived, and men were now obliged to make a choice among the pretenſions of
different ſects, the proper materials for deciſion, and above all, the holy
ſcriptures, ſhould be ſet before them, and the revealed will of God,
which the change of language had ſomewhat obſcured, be again, by their
means, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to mankind.</p>
               <p>THE favourers of the ancient religion maintained, on the other
hand, that the pretence of making the people ſee with their own eyes, was a
mere cheat, and was itſelf a very barefaced artifice, by which the new
preachers hoped to obtain the guidance of them, and ſeduce them from thoſe
paſtors, whom the laws, whom ancient eſtabliſhments, whom heaven itſelf
had appointed for their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual direction: That the people were, by their
ignorance, their ſtupidity, their neceſſary avocations, totally
unqualified to chooſe their own principles, and it was a mocquery to ſet
materials before them, of which they could not poſſibly make any proper
uſe: That even in the affairs of common life, and in their temporal concerns,
which lay more within the compaſs of human reaſon, the laws had, in a great
meaſure, deprived them of the right of private judgment, and had, happily,
for their own and the public intereſt, regulated their conduct and behaviour:
That theological queſtions were placed much beyond the ſphere of vulgar
comprehenſion; and eccleſiaſtics themſelves, tho' aſſiſted by all
the advantages of education, erudition, and an aſſiduous ſtudy of the
ſcience, could not be fully aſſured of a juſt deciſion; except by the
promiſe made them in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that God would be ever preſent with his
church, and that the gates of hell ſhould not prevail againſt her: That the
groſs errors adopted by the wiſeſt heathens, proved how unfit men were to
grope their own way, thro' this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found darkneſs; nor would the
ſcriptures, if truſted to every man's judgment, be able to remedy; on the
contrary, they would much augment, theſe fatal illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: That ſacred
writ itſelf was involved in ſo much obſcurity, was expoſed to ſo many
difficulties, contained ſo many appearing contradictions, that it was the
moſt dangerous weapon which could be intruſted into the hands of the
ignorant <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0429000101:207"/> and giddy multitude: That the poetical
ſpirit, in which a great part of it was compoſed, at the ſame time that
it occaſioned uncertainty in the ſenſe, by its multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied tropes and
figures, was ſufficient to kindle the zeal of fanaticiſm, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
throw civil ſociety into the moſt furious combuſtion: That a thouſand
ſects muſt ariſe, which would pretend, each of them, to derive its tenets
from the ſcripture; and would be able, by ſpecious arguments, or even
without ſpecious arguments, to ſeduce ſilly women, and ignorant
mechanics, into a belief of the moſt monſtrous principles: And that if ever
this diſorder, dangerous to the magiſtrate himſelf, received a remedy, it
muſt be from the tacit acquieſcence of the people in ſome new authority;
and it was evidently better, without farther conteſt or enquiry, to adhere
peaceably to ancient, and therefore the more ſecure eſtabliſhments.</p>
               <p>THESE latter arguments being more agreeable to
eccleſiaſtical government, would probably have prevailed in the
convocation, had it not been for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Cranmer, Latimer, and ſome
other biſhops, who were ſuppoſed to ſpeak the King's ſenſe of the
matter. A vote was paſſed for publiſhing a new tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the
ſcriptures; and in three years time this great work was finiſhed, and
printed at Paris. This was deemed a great point gained by the reformers; and a
conſiderable advancement of their cauſe. Farther progreſs was ſoon
expected, after ſuch important ſucceſſes.</p>
               <p>BUT while the retainers to the new religion were triumphing in
their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they met with a mortification, which ſeemed to blaſt
all their hopes: 
<note place="margin">Diſgrace of Q. Anne.</note> Their
patroneſs, Anne Boleyn, loſt the King's favour, and ſoon after her life,
from the rage of that furious monarch. Henry had perſevered conſtantly in
his love to this lady, during ſix years that his proſecution of the divorce
laſted; and the more obſtacles he met with to the gratification of his
paſſion, the more deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined zeal did he exert in purſuing his
purpoſe. But the affection which had ſubſiſted ſo long under
difficulties, had no ſooner attained ſecure poſſeſſion of its
object, than it languiſhed from ſatiety; and the King's heart was
apparently ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated from his conſort. Anne's enemies ſoon perceived this
fatal change; and they were very forward to widen the breach, when they found
that they incurred no danger by interpoſing in thoſe delicate concerns. She
had brought forth a dead ſon; and Henry's extreme fondneſs for male
iſſue being thus, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, diſappointed, his temper, equally
violent and ſuperſtitious, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to make the innocent mother
anſwerable for this misfortune<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol I. p.

                     </gap>.</note>. But the chief means
which Anne's enemies employed to enflame the King againſt her, was his
jealouſy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0429000101:208"/> ANNE, tho' ſhe appears to have been
entirely innocent, and even virtuous, in her conduct, had a certain gaiety, if
not levity, of character, which threw her off her guard, and made her leſs
circumſpect than her ſituation required. Her education in France rendered
her the more prone to theſe freedoms; and it was with difficulty ſhe
conformed herſelf to that ſtrict ceremonial which was practiſed in the
court of England. More vain than haughty, ſhe was pleaſed to ſee the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of her beauty on all around her, and ſhe indulged herſelf in an
eaſy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with perſons, who were formerly her equals, and who might
then have pretended to her friendſhip and good graces. Henry's dignity was
offended with theſe popular manners; and tho' the lover had been entirely
blind, the huſband poſſeſſed but too quick diſcernment and
penetration. Wicked inſtruments interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and put a malignant
interpretation on the harmleſs liberties of the Queen: The viſcounteſs of
Rocheford, in particular, who was married to the Queen's brother, but who lived
on bad terms with her ſiſter-in-law, inſinuated the moſt cruel
ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions into the King's mind; and as ſhe was a woman of a very
profligate cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, ſhe paid no regard either to truth or humanity in
thoſe calumnies which ſhe ſuggeſted. She pretended, that her own
huſband was engaged in a criminal correſpondence with his ſiſter; and
not contented with this imputation, ſhe poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned every action of the
Queen, and repreſented each inſtance of favour which ſhe conferred on any
one, as a token of affection. Henry Norris, groom of the ſtole, Weſton, and
Brereton, gentlemen of the King's chamber, together with Mark Smeton, groom of
the chamber, were obſerved to poſſeſs much of the Queen's friendſhip;
and they ſerved her with a zeal and attachment which, tho' chiefly derived
from gratitude, might not improbably be ſeaſoned with ſome mixture of
tenderneſs for ſo amiable a princeſs. The King's jealouſy laid hold of
the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt circumſtance; and finding no particular object on which it
could faſten, it vented itſelf equally on every one who came within the
verge of its fury.</p>
               <p>HAD Henry's jealouſy been derived from love, tho' it might on
a ſudden have proceeded to the moſt violent extremities, it would have been
ſubject to many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſes and contrarieties; and might at laſt have
ſerved only to augment that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, on which it was founded. But it was a
more ſtern jealouſy, foſtered en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely by pride: His love was wholly
transferred to another object. Jane Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, daughter of Sir John Seymour, and
maid of honour to the Queen, a young lady of ſingular beauty and merit, had
obtained an entire aſcendant over him; and he was determined to ſacrifice
every thing to the gratification of this new appetite. Unlike to moſt
monarchs, who judge lightly of the crime of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, and who deem the young
damſels of their court rather honoured than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced by their
paſſion, he never thought of any other attachment than that of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; 
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0429000101:209"/> and in order to attain this end, he underwent more
difficulties and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted greater crimes than thoſe which he ſought to
avoid by forming that legal connexion. And having thus entertained the deſign
of raiſing his new miſtreſs to his bed and throne, he more willingly
hearkened to every ſuggeſtion, which threw any imputation of guilt on the
unfortunate Anne Boleyn.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1ſt May.</note> THE King's jealouſy
firſt appeared openly in a tilting at Greenwich, where the Queen happened to
drop her handkerchief; an incident probably ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, but interpreted by him
as an inſtance of gallantry to ſome of her para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. 1. p. 198.</note>. He immediately retired from the
place; ſent orders to confine her to her chamber; arreſted Norris,
Brereton, Weſton, and Smeton, together with her brother, Rocheford; and threw
them into priſon. The Queen, aſtoniſhed at theſe inſtances of his
fury, thought that he meant only to try her; but finding him in earneſt,
ſhe reflected on his obſtinate unrelenting ſpirit, and ſhe prepared
herſelf for that melancholy doom, which was awaiting her. Next day, ſhe was
ſent to the Tower; and on her way thither, ſhe was informed of her
ſuppoſed offences, of which ſhe had been hitherto ignorant: She made
earneſt proteſtations of her innocence; and when ſhe entered the
priſon, ſhe fell on her knees, and prayed God ſo to help her, as ſhe
was not guilty of the crime imputed to her. Her ſurprize and confuſion
threw her into hiſterical diſorders; and in that ſituation, ſhe thought
that the beſt proof of innocence was to make an entire confeſſion, and
ſhe diſcovered ſome indiſcretions and levities, which her ſimplicity
had equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed her to commit and to avow. She owned, that ſhe had once
rallied Norris on his delaying his marriage, and had told him, that he probably
expected her, when ſhe ſhould be a widow: She had reproved Weſton, ſhe
ſaid, for his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to a kinſwoman of hers, and his indifference
towards his wife: But he told her, that ſhe had miſtaken the object of his
affection, for it was herſelf: Upon which, ſhe defied him<note n="†" place="bottom">Strype, vol. 1. p. 281.</note>. She affirmed, that Smeton had
never been in her chamber but twice when he played on the harpſicord: But
ſhe acknowledged, that he had once had the boldneſs to tell her, that a
look ſufficed him. The King, inſtead of being ſatisfied with the candour
and ſincerity of her confeſſion, regarded theſe indiſcretions only as
preludes to greater and more criminal intimacies.</p>
               <p>OF all thoſe multitudes, whom the beneficence of the Queen's
temper had obliged, during her proſperous fortune, no one durſt interpoſe
between her and the King's fury; and the perſon, whoſe advancement every
breath had favoured, and every countenance had ſmiled upon, was now left
neglected and abandoned. Even her uncle the duke of Norfolk, preferring the
connexions of party to the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

blood, was become her moſt dangerous enemy; and all the retainers to the 
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0429000101:210"/> catholic religion hoped, that her death would terminate
the King's quarrel with Rome, and leave him again to his natural and early
bent, which had inclined him to ſupport the moſt intimate connexions with
the apoſtolic <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ee. Cranmer alone,
of all the Queen's adherents, ſtill retained his friendſhip for her; and,
as far as the King's impetuoſity permitted him, he endeavoured to moderate
the violent prejudices, entertained againſt her.</p>
               <p>THE Queen herſelf wrote Henry a letter from the Tower, full of
the moſt tender expoſtulations, and of the warmeſt proteſtations of
innocence. It contains ſo much nature and even elegance, as to deſerve to
be tranſmitted to poſterity, without any alteration of the expreſſion.
It is as follows.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <p>SIR, your grace's diſpleaſure, and my impriſonment are
things ſo ſtrange unto me, as what to write, or what to excuſe, I am
altogether ignorant. Whereas you ſend unto me (willing me to confeſs a
truth, and ſo obtain your favour) by ſuch an one, whom you know to be mine
antient profeſſed enemy, I no ſooner received this meſſage by him,
than I rightly conceived your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and, if, as you ſay, confeſſing a
truth indeed may procure my ſafety, I ſhall with all willingneſs and duty
perform your command.</p>
                     <p>BUT let not your grace ever imagine, that your poor wife will
ever be brought to acknowledge a fault, where not ſo much as a thought
thereof pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded. And to ſpeak a truth, never prince had wife more loyal in
all duty, and in all true affection, than you have ever found in Anne Boleyn:
With which name and place I could willingly have contented myſelf, if God and
your grace's pleaſure had been ſo pleaſed. Neither did I at any time ſo
far forget myſelf in my exaltation or received queenſhip, but that I always
looked for ſuch an alteration as I now find; for the ground of my preferment
being on no ſurer foundation than your grace's fancy, the leaſt alteration
I knew was fit and ſufficient to draw that fancy to ſome other object. You
have choſen me from a low eſtate to be your Queen and companion, far beyond
my deſert or deſire. If then you found me worthy of ſuch honour, good
your grace let not any light fancy, or bad counſel of mine enemies, withdraw
your princely favour from me; neither let that ſtain, that unworthy ſtain,
of a diſloyal heart towards your good grace, ever caſt ſo foul a blot on
your moſt dutiful wife, and the infant princeſs your daughter. Try me, good
King, but let me have a lawful trial, and let not my ſworn enemies ſit as
my accuſers and judges; yea let me receive an open trial, for my truth
ſhall fear no open ſhame; then ſhall you ſee either mine innocence
cleared, your ſuſpicion and <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0429000101:211"/> conſcience
ſatisfied, the ignominy and ſlander of the world ſtopped, or my guilt
openly declared. So that whatſoever God or you may determine of me, your
grace may be freed from an open cenſure, and mine offence being ſo
law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully proved, your grace is at liberty, both before God and man, not only
to execute worthy puniſhment on me as an unlawful wife, but to follow your
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, already ſettled on that party, for whoſe ſake I am now as I
am, whoſe name I could ſome good while ſince have pointed unto, your
grace not being ignorant of my ſuſpicion therein.</p>
                     <p>BUT if you have already determined of me, and that not only my
death, but an infamous ſlander muſt bring you the enjoying of your
deſired happineſs; then I deſire of God, that he will pardon your great
ſin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and likewiſe mine enemies, the inſtruments thereof, and
that he will not call you to a ſtrict account for your unprincely and cruel
uſage of me, at his general judgment-ſeat, where both you and myſelf
muſt ſhortly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and in whoſe judgment I doubt not (whatſoever the
world may think of me) mine innocence ſhall be openly known, and
ſufficiently cleared.</p>
                     <p>MY laſt and only requeſt ſhall be, that myſelf may
only bear the burden of your grace's diſpleaſure, and that it may not touch
the innocent ſouls of thoſe poor gentlemen, who (as I underſtand) are
likewiſe in ſtrait impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for my ſake. If ever I have found
favour in your ſight, if ever the name of Anne Boleyn hath been pleaſing in
your ears, then let me obtain this requeſt, and I will ſo leave to trouble
your grace any further, with mine earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt prayers to the Trinity to have
your grace in his good keeping, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you in all your actions. From my
doleful priſon in the Tower, this ſixth of May;</p>

                  <note place="margin">Her trial.</note> THIS letter had no
influence on the unrelenting mind of Henry, who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to pave the way
for his new marriage by the death of Anne Boleyn. Norris, Weſton, Brereton,
and Smeton, were tried; but no legal evidence was produced againſt them. The
chief proof of their guilt conſiſted in a hear-ſay report from one lady
Wingfield, who was dead. Smeton was prevailed on, by the vain hope of life, to
confeſs a criminal correſpondence with the Queen<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. I. p. 202.</note>; but even her enemies expected
little advantage from this confeſſion: For they never dared to confront him
with her; and he was immediately executed; as were <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0429000101:212"/>
alſo Brereton and Weſton. Norris had been much in the King's favour; and an
offer was made him of life, if he would confeſs his crime, and accuſe the
Queen: But he generouſly rejected that propoſal; and ſaid, that in his
conſcience he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved her entirely guiltleſs: But, for his part, he could
accuſe her of nothing, and he would die a thouſand deaths rather than
calumniate an innocent perſon.</p>
               <p>THE Queen and her brother were tried by a jury of peers,
conſiſting of the duke of Suffolk, the Marquis of Exeter, the earl of
Arundel, and twenty-three more: Their uncle, the duke of Norfolk, preſided as
lord high ſteward. Upon what proof or pretext the crime of inceſt was
imputed to them is unknown: The chief evidence, it is ſaid, amounted to no
more than that Rocheford had been ſeen to lean on her bed before ſome
company. Part of the charge againſt her was, that ſhe had affirmed to her
minions, that the King never had her heart; and had ſaid to each of them
apart, that ſhe loved him better than any perſon whatſoever: <hi>Which
was to the ſlander of the iſſue begot between the King and her:</hi> By
this ſtrained interpretation, her guilt was brought under the ſtatute of
the 25th of this reign; in which it was declared criminal to throw any
ſlander upon the King, Queen, or their iſſue. Such palpable abſurdities
were, at that time, admitted, and they were regarded by the peers of England as
a ſufficient reaſon for ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing an innocent Queen to the cruelty of
their tyrant. Tho' unaſſiſted by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, ſhe defended herſelf
with great judgment and preſence of mind; and the ſpectators could not
forbear pronouncing her entirely innocent. Judgment, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was given by the
court, both againſt the Queen and lord Rocheford; and her verdict contained,
that ſhe ſhould be burned or beheaded at the King's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. When this
dreadful ſentence was pronounced, ſhe was not terrified, but lifting up her
hands to heaven, ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"O! Father, O! Creator, thou who art the way,
the truth, and the life, thou knoweſt that I have not deſerved this
death."</q> And then turning to the judges, made the moſt pathetic
decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of her innocence.</p>
               <p>HENRY, not ſatisfied with this cruel vengeance, was reſolved
entirely to annul his marriage with Anne Boleyn, and to declare her iſſue
illegitimate: He recalled to his memory, that, a little after her appearance in
the Engliſh court, ſome attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been acknowledged between her and
the earl of Northumberland, then lord Piercy; and he now queſtioned the
nobleman with regard to theſe engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Northumberland took an oath
before the two archbiſhops, that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract nor promiſe of marriage had
ever paſſed between them: He received the ſacrament upon it, before the
duke of Norfolk and others of the privy council; and this ſolemn act he
accompanied with the moſt ſolemn proteſtations of his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity.

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Herbert, page 384.</note>. The
Queen, however, was ſhaken by menaces of executing the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt
her in its greateſt rigour, and was prevailed on to confeſs in court,
ſome lawful impediment to her marriage with the King<note n="†" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 94.</note>. The afflicted primate, who ſat as judge,
thought himſelf obliged by this confeſſion, to pronounce the marriage
null and invalid. Henry, in the tranſports of his fury, did not perceive that
his proceedings were totally inconſiſtent, and that if her marriage was,
from the beginning, invalid, ſhe could not poſſibly be guilty of
adultery.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">And execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> THE Queen now prepared
for ſuffering that death to which ſhe was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced. She ſent her
laſt meſſage to the King, and acknowledged the obligations which ſhe
owed him, in continuing thus uniformly his endeavours for her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement:
From a private gentlewoman, ſhe ſaid, he had firſt made her a
marchioneſs, then a queen, and now, ſince he could raiſe her no higher in
this world, he was ſending her to be a ſaint in heaven: She then renewed
the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of her innocence, and recommended her daughter to his
care. Before the lieutenant of the Tower, and all who approached her, ſhe
made the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations; and continued to behave herſelf with her uſual
ſerenity, and even with chearfulneſs. 
<q rend="inline">"The executioner," ſhe ſaid to the
lieutenant, "is, I hear, very expert; and my neck is very ſlender:"</q> 
                  <note place="margin">29th May.</note> Upon which ſhe graſped it
in her hand, and laughed heartily. When brought, however, to the ſcaffold,
ſhe ſoftened her tone a little with regard to her proteſtations of
innocence. She reflected, that the obſtinacy of Queen Catherine, and her
reſiſtance to the King's will, had much alienated him from the lady Mary;
and her maternal concern, therefore, for Elizabeth, prevailed in theſe laſt
moments over that indignation, which the unjuſt ſentence, by which ſhe
ſuffered, naturally excited in her. She ſaid, that ſhe was come to die,
as ſhe was ſentenced, by the law: She would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe none, nor ſay any
thing of the ground upon which ſhe was judged. She prayed heartily for the
King; and called him a moſt merciful and gentle prince, and acknowledged,
that he had always been to her a good and gracious ſovereign; and if any one
ſhould think proper to canvaſs her cauſe, ſhe deſired him to judge
the beſt<note n="‡" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. I. p. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

executioner of Calais, who was brought over as more expert than any in England.
Her body was negligently thrown into a common cheſt of elm-tree, made to hold
arrows; and was buried in the Tower.</p>
               <p>THE innocence of this unfortunate Queen cannot reaſonably be
called in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Henry himſelf, in the violence of his rage, knew not
whom to accuſe as her lover; and tho' he imputed guilt to her brother, and
four perſons more, he <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0429000101:214"/> was able to bring proof
againſt none of them. The whole tenour of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct forbids us to
aſcribe to her an abandoned character, ſuch as is implied in the King's
accuſation; and had ſhe been ſo loſt to all prudence and ſenſe of
ſhame; ſhe muſt have expoſed herſelf to detection, and afforded her
enemies the cleareſt evidence againſt her. But the King made the moſt
effectual apology for her, by marrying Jane Seymour the very day after her
execution<note n="‖" place="bottom">Burnet vol I. p. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

this new paſſion, cauſed him to forget all regard to decency; and his
cruel heart was not ſoftened a moment by the bloody cataſtrophe of a

               <p>THE lady Mary thought the death of her ſtep-mother a proper
opportunity for reconciling herſelf with the King, who, beſides other
cauſes of diſguſt, had been offended with her, on account of the part
which ſhe had taken in her mother's quarrel. Her advances were not at firſt
received; and Henry exacted from her ſome further proofs of ſubmiſſion
and obedience: He required this young prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, then about twenty years of
age, to adopt his theological tenets; to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his ſupremacy; to
renounce the pope; and to own her mother's marriage to be inceſtuous and
unlawful. Theſe points were of hard digeſtion with the princeſs; but
after ſome delays, and even refuſals, ſhe was at laſt prevailed with to
write a letter to her father<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid.

of Queen Anne, and the ſubſequent events, made it neceſſary for the
King to ſummon a new Parliament; and he here, in his ſpeech, made a merit
to his people, that, notwithſtanding his misfortunes in his two former
marriages, he had been induced, for their good, to venture on a third. The
ſpeaker received this profeſſion with a ſuitable gratitude; and he took
thence oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to praiſe the King for his wonderful gifts of grace and
nature: He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared him, for juſtice and prudence, to Solomon; for
ſtrength and fortitude to Sampſon; and for beauty and comelineſs to
Abſalom. The King very humbly replied, by the mouth of his chancellor, that
he diſavowed theſe praiſes; ſince, if he was really poſſeſſed
of ſuch virtues, they were the gifts of Almighty God only. Henry found that

attainted; the iſſue of both the two former marriages were declared
illegitimate, and it was even made treaſon to aſſert the legitimacy of
either of them; to throw any ſlander upon the preſent King, Queen, or their
iſſue, was ſubjected to the ſame penalty; the crown was ſettled on
the King's iſſue by Jane Seymour, or any ſubſequent wife; and in caſe
he ſhould die without children, he was impowered by his will, or letters

be guilty of treaſon; and by this clauſe a ſpecies of political
inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was eſtabliſhed in the kingdom, as well as the accuſations
of treaſon multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to an unreaſonable degree. The King was alſo
empowered to confer on any one, by his will, or letters patent, any caſtles,
honours, liberties, or franchiſes; words which might have been extended to
the diſmembring the kingdom, by the erection of principalities and
independant juriſdictions. It was alſo, by another act, made treaſon to
marry, without the King's conſent, any princeſs related in the firſt
degree to the crown. This act was occaſioned by the diſcovery of a
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, formed by Thomas Howard, brother to the duke of Norfolk, to
eſpouſe the lady Margaret Douglas, niece to the King by his ſiſter the
Queen of Scots and the earl of Angus. Howard, as well as the young lady, was

the crown: The King or any of his ſucceſſors was empowered to repeal or
annul, by letters patent, whatever acts of parliament had been paſſed
before he was four and twenty years of age. Whoever maintained the authority of
the biſhop of Rome, by word or writ, or endeavoured in any manner to
reſtore it in England, was ſubjected to the penalty of a premunire; that
is, his goods were forfeited, and he was put out of the protection of the laws.

ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0429000101:216"/> to Henry: But this was the reception he
met with. Henry was now become abſolutely indifferent with regard to papal
cenſures; and finding a great increaſe of authority, as well as revenue, to
accrue from his quarrel with Rome, he was determined to perſevere in his
preſent meaſures. This Parliament alſo, even more than any foregoing,
convinced him how much he commanded the reſpect of his ſubjects, and what
confidence he might repoſe in them. Tho' the elections had been made of a

                  <note place="margin">A convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> THE extreme
complaiſance of the convocation, which ſat at the ſame time with the
Parliament, encouraged him in his reſolution of breaking entirely with the
court of Rome. There was a diviſion of ſentiments in the minds of this
aſſembly; and as the zeal of the reformers had been augmented by ſ me
late ſucceſſes, the reſentment of the catholics was no leſs excited
by their fears and loſſes: But the authority of the King kept every thing
ſubmiſſive and ſilent; and the new aſſumed prerogative, the
ſupremacy, whoſe limits no one was fully acquainted with, reſtrained even
the moſt furious movements of theological ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. Cromwel ſat as
vicar-general; and tho' the catholic party expected, that, on the fall of Queen
Anne, his authority would receive a great check, they were ſurprized to find
him ſtill maintain equal credit as before. With the vicar-general concurred
Cranmer the primate, Latimer biſhop of Worceſter, Shaxton of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſbury,
Hilſey of Rocheſter, Fox of Hereford, Barlow of St. David's. The oppoſite
party were led by Lee archbiſhop of York, Stokeſley biſhop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Tonſtal of Durham, Gardiner of Wincheſter, Longland of Lincoln, Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
of Chicheſter, Nix of Norwich, and Kite of Carliſle. The former party, by
their oppoſition to the pope, ſeconded the King's ambition and love of
power: The latter party, by maintaining the ancient theological tenets, were
more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his ſpeculative principles: And both of them had
alternately the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of gaining on his humour, by which he was more
governed than by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe motives.</p>
               <p>THE church in general was averſe to the reformation; and the
lower houſe framed a liſt of opinions, in the whole ſixty ſeven, which
they pronounced er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, and which was a collection of principles, ſome
held by the ancient Lol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards, others by the modern proteſtants, or
Goſpellers, as they were ſometimes called. This catalogue they ſent to
the upper houſe to be cenſured; but in the preamble of their
repreſentation, they diſcovered the ſervile ſpirit by which they were
governed. They ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"that they intended not to do or ſpeak any
thing <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0429000101:217"/> which might be unpleaſant to the King, whom they
acknowledge their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme head, and whoſe commands they were reſolved to
obey; renouncing the pope's uſurped authority, with all his laws and

Almighty God and his laws, and unto the King and the laws made within this
kingdom<note n="*" place="bottom">Collier, vol. II p. 119.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE convocation came at laſt, after ſome debate, to decide
articles of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and their tenets were of as compounded a nature as the
aſſembly itſelf, or rather as the King's ſyſtem of theology, by which
they were reſolved entirely to ſquare their principles. They determined the
ſtandard of faith to conſiſt in the ſcriptures and the three creeds,
the Apoſtolic, the Nicene, and the Athanaſian; and this article was a
ſignal victory to the reformers: Auricular confeſſion and pennance were
admitted, a doctrine agreeable to the catholics: No mention was made of
marriage, extreme unction, confirmation, or holy orders, as ſacraments; and
in this omiſſion the influence of the proteſtants appeared. The real
preſence was aſſerted, conformable to the ancient doctrine: The terms of
acceptance were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed to be the merits of Chriſt, and the mercy
and good pleaſure of God, ſuitable to the new principles.</p>
               <p>SO far the two ſects ſeem to have made a fair partition, by
ſharing alternately the ſeveral clauſes. In framing the ſubſequent
articles, each of them ſeems to have thrown in their ingredient. The
catholics prevailed in aſſerting, that the uſe of images was warranted by
ſcripture; the proteſtants, in warning the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt idolatry, and
the abuſe of theſe ſenſible repreſentations. The ancient faith was
adopted in maintaining the expediency of praying to ſaints; the late
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations in rejecting the peculiar patronage of ſaints to any trade,
profeſſion, or courſe of action. The former rites of worſhip, the uſe
of holy water, the ceremonies practiſed on Aſh-wedneſday, Palm-ſunday,
and Good-friday, &amp;c. were ſtill maintained; but the new reſinements
were alſo adopted, which made light of theſe inſtitutions, by the
convocation's denying that they had any imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate power of remitting ſin,
and by its aſſerting that their ſole merit conſiſted in promoting
pious and devout diſpoſitions in the mind.</p>
               <p>BUT the article with regard to purgatory, contains the moſt
curious jargon, ambiguity, and heſitation, ariſing from the mixture of
oppoſite tenets. It was to this purpoſe: 
<q rend="inline">"Since according to due order of charity, and
the book of Maccabees, and divers ancient authors, it is a very good and
charitable deed to pray for ſouls departed; and ſince ſuch a practice has
been maintained in the church from the beginning; all biſhops and teachers
ſhould inſtruct the people not to be grieved for the continuance of the
ſame. But ſince the place <pb n="213" facs="tcp:0429000101:218"/> where departed ſouls are
retained, before they reach Paradiſe, as well as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their pains,
is left uncertain by ſcripture; all ſuch queſtions are to be ſubmitted
to God, to whoſe mercy it is meet and convenient to commend the deceaſed,
truſting that he accepteth our prayers for them."</q>

               </p>
               <p>THESE articles, when framed by the convocation, and corrected by
the King, were ſubſcribed by every member of that aſſembly; while,
perhaps, neither there nor throughout the whole kingdom, could one man be
found, except the King himſelf, who had adopted preciſely theſe very
doctrines and opinions. For tho' there be not any contradiction in the tenets
here advanced, it had happened in England, as in all other ſtates where
factious diviſions have place; a certain creed was embraced by each party;
few neutrals were to be found; and theſe conſiſted only of ſpeculative
or whimſical people, of whom two perſons could ſcarce be brought to an
agreement in the ſame dogmas. The proteſtants, all of them, carried their
oppoſition to Rome farther than theſe articles: None of the catholics went
ſo far: And the King, by being able to retain the nation in ſuch a delicate
medium, diſplayed the utmoſt power of an imperious deſpotiſm, of which
any hiſtory furniſhes an example. To change the religion of a country, even
when ſeconded by a party, is one of the moſt perilous enterprizes, which
any ſovereign can attempt, and often proves the moſt deſtructive to royal
authority. But Henry was able to ſet that furious machine in movement, and
yet regulate and even ſtop its career: He could ſay to it, thus far ſhalt
thou go and no farther: And he made every vote of his parliament and
convocation ſubſervient, not only to his intereſts and paſſions, but
even to his ſmalleſt caprices; nay, to his moſt refined and moſt
ſcholaſtic ſubtilties.</p>
               <p>THE concurrence of theſe two national aſſemblies ſerved,
no doubt, to increaſe the King's power among the people, and raiſed him to
an authority more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, than any prince, in a ſimple monarchy, even by
means of military force, is ever able to attain. But there are certain bounds,
beyond which the moſt ſlaviſh ſubmiſſion cannot be extended. All

               <p>THE Earl of Shrewſbury, moved by his zeal for the King's

King's couſin-german, obeyed orders from court, and levied troops. The earls
of Huntingdon, Derby, and Rutland, imitated his example. The rebels, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
prevailed in taking both Hull and York: They laid ſiege to Pomfret caſtle,
into which the archbiſhop of York and lord Darcy had thrown themſelves. It
was ſoon ſurrendered to them; and the prelate and nobleman, who ſecretly
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the cauſe, ſeemed to yield to the force impoſed on them, and
joined the rebels.</p>
               <p>THE duke of Norfolk was named general in chief of the King's
forces againſt the northern inſurgents; and as he headed the party, which
ſupported the antient religion, he was alſo ſuſpected of bearing ſome
favour to the cauſe, which he was ſent to oppoſe. His prudent conduct,
however, ſeems to acquit him of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. He encamped at Doncaſter,
together with the earl of Shrewſbury; and as his army was ſmall, ſcarce
exceeding five thouſand men, he made choice of a poſt, where he had the
river in front, the ford of which he propoſed to deſend againſt the
rebels. They had intended to attack him in the morning; but dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the night,
there fell ſuch violent rains as rendered the river utterly impaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and Norfolk very wiſely laid hold of the opportunity to enter into treaty
with them. In order to open the door for negotiation, he ſent them a herald;
whom Aſke, their leader, received with great ceremony; he himſelf ſitting
in a chair of ſtate, with the archbiſhop of York on one hand, and lord
Darcy on the other. It was agreed that two gentlemen ſhould be diſpatched
to the King with propoſals from the inſurgents; and Henry protracted giving
an anſwer, and allured them with hopes of entire ſatisfaction, in
expectation that neceſſity would ſoon oblige them to diſperſe
themſelves. Being informed, that his artifice had in a great meaſure
ſucceeded, he required them inſtantly to lay down their arms and ſubmit
to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

all except ſix whom he named, and <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0429000101:222"/> four whom he
reſerved to himſelf the power of naming. But tho' the greateſt part of
the rebels had gone home for want of ſubſiſtance, they had entered into
the moſt ſolemn engagements to return to their ſtandards, in caſe the
King's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſhould not prove ſatisfactory. Norfolk, therefore, ſoon
found himſelf in the ſame difficulty as before; and he opened again a
negotiation with the leaders of the multitude. He engaged them to ſend three
hundred perſons to Doncaſter, with propoſals for an accommodation; and he
hoped to be able, by intrigue and ſeparate intereſts, to throw
diſſenſion among ſo great a number. Aſke himſelf had propoſed to
be one of the deputies, and he required a hoſtage for his ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: But
the King, when conſulted, replied, that he knew no gentleman or other, whom
he eſteemed ſo little as to put him in pledge for ſuch a villain. The
demands of the inſurgents were ſo exorbitant, that Norfolk rejected them;
and they prepared again to decide the conteſt by force of arms. They were as
formidable as ever both by their numbers and ſpirit; and notwithſtanding a
ſmall river, which lay between them and the royal army, Norfolk had great
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to dread the effects of their fury. But while they were preparing to
paſs the ford, rain fell a ſecond time in ſuch abundance, as made it
impracticable for them to execute their deſign; and the populace, partly
reduced to neceſſity by the want of proviſions, partly ſtruck with
ſuperſtition at being thus again diſappointed by the ſame accident,
ſuddenly diſperſed themſelves. The duke of Norfolk, who had received
powers for that end, forwarded the diſperſion, by the promiſe of a
general amneſty; and the King ratified this act of clemency. 
<note place="margin">9th of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</note> He publiſhed,
how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, a manifeſto againſt the rebels, and an anſwer to their
complaints; where he employed a very lofty ſtyle, ſuited to ſo haughty a
monarch. He told them, that they ought no more to pretend giving a judgment
with regard to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than a blind man with regard to colours: 
<q rend="inline">"And we," he added, "with our whole council

likely to be of long continuance, Norfolk was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to keep his army
together, and to go into the northern parts, in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act a general
ſubmiſſion. Lord Darcy as well as Aſke were ſent for to court; and
the former, upon his refuſal or delay to appear, was thrown into priſon.
Every place was full of jealouſy and complaints. A new inſurrection broke
out, headed by Muſgrave and Tilby; and the rebels beſieged Carliſle with
8000 men. Being repulſed by that town, they were encountered in their retreat
by Norfolk, who put them to flight; and having made priſoners of all their
officers, except <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0429000101:223"/> Muſgrave, who eſcaped, he
inſtantly put them to death by martial law, to the number of ſeventy
perſons. An attempt made by Sir Francis Bigot and Halam to ſurprize Hull,
met with no better ſucceſs; and ſeveral other riſings were
ſuppreſſed by the vigilance of Norfolk. The King, enraged by theſe
multiplied revolts, was determined not to adhere to the general pardon, which
he had granted; and from a movement of his uſual violence, he made the
innocent ſuffer for the guilty. Norfolk, by command from his maſter,
ſpread the royal banner, and, wherever he thought proper, executed martial
law in the puniſhment of offenders. Beſides Aſke, leader of the firſt
inſurrection, Sir Robert Conſtable, Sir John Bulmer, Sir Thomas Piercy, Sir
Stephen Hamilton, Nicholas Tempeſt, William Lumley, and many others, were
thrown into priſon; and moſt of them were condemned and executed. Lord
Huffey was found guilty as an accomplice in the inſurrection of
Lincolnſhire, and was executed at Lincoln. Lord Darcy, tho' he pleaded
compulſion, and appealed to a long life, paſſed in the ſervice of the
crown, was beheaded on Tower-hill. Before his execution, he accuſed Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk
of having ſecretly encouraged the rebels; but Henry, either ſenſible of
that nobleman's great ſervices and convinced of his fidelity, or afraid to
offend one of ſuch extenſive power and great capacity, rejected the
information. Being now ſatiated with puniſhing the rebels, he publiſhed
anew a general pardon, to which he faithfully adhered<note n="*" place="bottom">Herbert, p. 428.</note>; and he erected by patent a court of
juſtice at York, for deciding lawſuits to the northern counties: A demand

rebels and the birth of a ſon, as they confirmed Henry's authority at home,
encreaſed his conſideration among foreign princes, and made 
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0429000101:224"/> his alliance be courted by all parties. He maintained,
however, a neutrality in the wars, which were carried on, with various
ſucceſs, and without any deciſive event, between Charles and Francis; and
tho' inclined more to favour the latter, he was determined not to incur,
without neceſſity, either hazard or expence in his behalf. A truce,
concluded about this time, between theſe potentates, and which was afterwards
prolonged for ten years, freed him from all anxiety on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his ally,
and re-eſtabliſhed the tranquillity of Europe.</p>
               <p>HENRY was very deſirous of cementing an union with the German
proteſtants; and for that purpoſe, he ſent Chriſtopher Mount to a
congreſs which they held at Brunſwick; but that miniſter made no great
progreſs in his negotiations. The princes deſired to know, what were the
articles in their confeſſion which Henry diſliked; and they ſent new
ambaſſadors to him, who had orders both to negotiate and to diſpute. They
endeavoured to convince the King, that he was guilty of a miſtake, in
adminiſtering the euchariſt in one kind only, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of private
maſſes, and in requiring the celibacy of the clergy<note n="*" place="bottom">Collier, vol. ii. p. 145. from the Cott. Lib. Cleopatra, E. 5.
fol. 173.</note>. Henry would by no means acknowlege any error in theſe
particulars; and was offended that they ſhould pretend to preſcribe rules
to ſo great a monarch and theologian. He found arguments and ſyllogiſms
enough to defend his cauſe; and he diſmiſſed the ambaſſadors
without coming to any concluſion. Jealous alſo leſt his own ſubjects
ſhould become ſuch theologians as to queſtion his tenets, he uſed great
precautions in publiſhing that tranſlation of the ſcripture, which was
finiſhed this year. He would only allow a copy of it to be depoſited in
each pariſh church, where it was fixed by a chain: And he took care to inform
the people by proclamation, 
<q rend="inline">"That this indulgence was not the effect of his
duty, but of his goodneſs and his liberality to them; who therefore ſhould
uſe it mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, for the encreaſe of virtue, not of ſtrife: And he
ordered that no man ſhould read the Bible aloud, ſo as to diſturb the
prieſt, while he ſang maſs, nor preſume to expound doubtful places,
without advice from the learned."</q> In this meaſure, as in the reſt, he
ſtill halted half way between the catholics and the proteſtants.</p>
               <p>THERE was only one particular, in which Henry was quite
deciſive, becauſe he was there impelled by his avarice, or more properly
ſpeaking, his rapacity, occaſioned by profuſeneſs: This meaſure was
the entire deſtruction of the mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. 
<note place="margin">Suppreſſion of the greater
monaſteries.</note> The preſent opportunity ſeemed favourable for that
great enterprize; while the ſuppreſſion of the late rebellion fortified
and encreaſed the royal authority; and as ſome of the abbots were
ſuſpected of having encouraged the inſurrection, and of correſponding
with the rebels, the King's reſentment was farther incited 
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0429000101:225"/> by that motive. A new viſitation was appointed of all
the monaſteries in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and a pretence only being wanted for their
ſuppreſſion, it was eaſy for a prince, poſſeſſed of ſuch
exorbitant power, and ſeconding the preſent humour of a great part of the
nation, to find or feign one. The abbots and monks knew the danger, to which
they were expoſed; and having learned, by the example of the leſſer
monaſteries, that nothing could withſtand the King's will, they were moſt
of them induced, in expectation of better treatment, to make a voluntary
reſignation of their houſes. Where promiſes failed of effect, menaces and
even extreme violence were employed; and as ſeveral of the abbots, ſince
the breach with Rome, had been named by the court, with a view to this event,
the King's intentions were the more eaſily effectuated. Some alſo, having
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly embraced the doctrine of the reformation, were glad to be freed
from their vows; and on the whole, the deſign was conducted with ſuch
ſucceſs, that, in leſs than two years, the King had got
poſſeſſion of all the monaſtic revenues.</p>
               <p>IN ſeveral places, particularly in the county of Oxford, great
intereſt was made to preſerve ſome convents of women, who, as they lived
in the moſt irreproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner, juſtly merited, it was thought, that
their houſes ſhould be ſaved from the general deſtruction<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. i. p. 328.</note>. There appeared alſo great
difference between the caſe of nuns and friars; and the one inſtitution
might be very laudable, while the other was expoſed to much blame. The males
of all ranks, if endowed with induſtry, might be of ſervice to the public;
and none of them could want em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, ſuited to his ſtation and
capacity. But a woman of family, who failed of a ſettlement in the married
ſtate, an accident to which ſuch perſons were more liable than women of
lower ſtation, had really no rank which ſhe properly filled; and a convent
was a retreat both honourable and agreeable, from the inutility and often want,
which attended her ſituation. But the King was determined to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
monaſteries of every denomination; and probably thought, that theſe antient
eſtabliſhments would be the ſooner forgot, that no remains of them, of
any kind, were allowed to ſubſiſt in the kingdom.</p>
               <p>THE better to reconcile the people to this great innovation,
ſtories were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed of the deteſtable lives of the friars in many of
the convents; and great care was taken to defame thoſe whom the court was
determined to ruin. The relicts alſo, and ſuperſtitions, which had ſo
long been the object of the people's venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were expoſed to their
ridicule; and the religious ſpirit, now leſs bent on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
obſervances and ſenſible objects, was encouraged in this new direction.
It is needleſs to be particular in ſuch an enumeration: Proteſtant
hiſtorians mention on this occaſion with great triumph the ſacred
repoſitories of convents; the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0429000101:226"/> of St. Edmond's
toes; ſome of the coals that roaſted St. Laurence; the girdle of the Virgin
ſhown in eleven ſeveral places; two or three heads of St. Urſula; the
felt of St. Thomas of Lancaſter, an infallible cure for the headach; part of
St. Thomas of Canterbury's ſhirt, much reverenced by big bellied wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
ſome relicts, an excellent preventive againſt rain; others, a remedy to
weeds in corn. But ſuch fooleries, as they are to be found in all ages and
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world, and even took place during the moſt refined periods of
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, form no peculiar nor violent reproach on the catholic religion.</p>
               <p>THERE were alſo diſcovered in the monaſteries ſome
impoſtures of a more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial nature. At Hales, in the county of
Glouceſter, had been ſhown, during ſeveral ages, the blood of Chriſt
brought from Jeruſalem; and it is eaſy to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the veneration, with
which ſuch a relict was regarded. A miraculous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance alſo
attended this miraculous relict; the ſacred blood was not viſible to any
one in mortal ſin, even when ſet before him; and till he had performed good
works ſufficient for his abſolution, it would not deign to diſcover
itſelf to him. At the diſſolution of the monaſtery, the whole
contrivance was diſcovered. Two of the monks, who were let into the ſecret,
had taken the blood of a duck, which they renewed every week: They put it into
a phial, one ſide of which conſiſted of thin and tranſparent
chryſtal, the other of thick and obſcure. When any rich pilgrim arrived,
they were ſure to ſhow him the dark ſide of the phial, till maſſes
and offerings had expiated his offences; and then finding his money, or
patience, or faith, near exhauſted, they made him happy by turning the
phial<note n="*" place="bottom">Herbert, p. 431, 432. Stowe, p. 575.</note>.</p>

the pawn, people made themſelves very merry with the poor creditor, on
account of his ſecurity.</p>
               <p>BUT of all the inſtruments of antient ſuperſtition, no-one
was ſo zealouſly deſtroyed as the ſhrine of Thomas a Becket, commonly
called St. Thomas of <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0429000101:227"/> Canterbury. This ſaint owed his
canonization to the zealous defence, which he had made for the apoſtolic
ſee; and on that account alſo, the monks had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely encouraged the
devotion of pilgrimages towards his tomb, and number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs were the miracles,
which, they pretended, his relicts wrought on his devout votaries. They
raiſed his body once a year; and the day, on which this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was
performed, which was called the day of his tranſlation, was a general
holyday: Every fiftieth year there was celebrated a jubilee to his honour,
which laſted fifteen days: Plenary indulgences were then granted to all that
viſited his tomb; and a hundred thouſand pilgrims have been regiſtered at
a time in Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury. The devotion towards him had quite effaced in that town
the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Deity; nay, even that of the Virgin. At God's altar, for
inſtance, there was offered in one year three pounds two ſhillings and
ſix-pence; at the Virgin's, ſixty three pounds five ſhillings and
ſix-pence; at St. Thomas's, eight hundred and thirty two pounds twelve
ſhillings and three-pence. But next year, the diſproportion was ſtill
greater: There was not a penny offered at God's altar; the Virgin's gained only
four pounds one ſhilling and eight-pence; but St. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas had got for his
ſhare nine hundred and fifty four pounds ſix ſhillings and
three-pence<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. i. p. 244.</note>. Lewis the
ſeventh of France had made a pilgrimage to this miraculous tomb, and had
beſtowed on the ſhrine a jewel, which was eſteemed the richeſt in
Chriſtendom. It is obvious, how obnoxious to Henry a ſaint of this
character muſt appear, and how much contrary to all his projects for
degrading the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the court of Rome. He not only pillaged the rich
ſhrine, dedicated to St. Thomas: He made the ſaint himſelf be cited to
appear in court, and be tried and condemned as a traitor: He ordered his name
to be ſtruck out of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender; the office for his feſtival to be
expunged from all breviaries; and his bones to be burned, and the aſhes to be
diſſipated.</p>
               <p>ON the whole, the King, at different times, ſuppreſſed
ſix hundred and forty five monaſteries: Of which twenty eight had abbots,
who enjoyed a ſeat in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Ninety colleges were demoliſhed in
ſeveral counties; two thouſand three hundred and ſeventy four chantries
and free chappels: A hundred and ten hoſpitals. The whole revenue of theſe
eſtabliſhments amounted to one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty one thouſand one
hundred pounds<note n="†" place="bottom">Lord Herbert, Camden,
Speed.</note>. It is worthy of obſervation, that the whole lands and
poſſeſſions of England had, a little before this period, been rated at
three millions a year; ſo that the revenues of the monaſteries did not
really much exceed the twentieth part of the national income: A ſum vaſtly
inferior to what is commonly apprehended. The lands belonging to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0429000101:228"/> were commonly let at very low leaſes; and the farmers,
who regarded themſelves as a ſpecies of proprietors, took always care to
renew their leaſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they expired.</p>
               <p>GREAT murmurs were every where excited againſt theſe
violences; and men much queſtioned, whether priors and monks, who were only
truſtees or tenants for life, could by any deed, however voluntary, transfer
to the King the entire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of their eſtates. In order to reconcile the
people to ſuch mighty inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, they were told, that the King would never
henceforth have occaſion to levy taxes, but would be able, from the abbey
lands alone, to bear, during war as well as peace, the whole charges of the
government<note n="*" place="bottom">Coke's 4th Inſt. fol. 44.</note>. While
ſuch topics were employed to pacify the populace, the King took an effectual
method of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging the nobility and gentry to take part with his
meaſures<note n="†" place="bottom">Dugdale's Warwickſhire, p.
800.</note>: He either made a gift of the revenues of convents to his
favourites and courtiers, or ſold them at low prices, or exchanged them for
other lands on very diſadvantageous terms. He was ſo profuſe in theſe
liberalities, that he is ſaid to have given a woman the whole revenues of a
convent, as a reward for making a pudding, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to gratify his
palate<note n="‡" place="bottom">Fuller.</note>. He alſo ſettled
ſallaries on the abbots and priors, proportioned to their former revenues or
to their merits; and gave each monk a yearly penſion of eight marks: He
erected ſix new biſhoprics, Weſtminſter, Oxford, Peterborow, Briſtol,
Cheſter, and Glouceſter; of which the laſt five ſubſiſt at this
day: And by all theſe means of expence and diſſipation, the profit which
the King reaped by the ſeizure of church lands, fell much ſhort of vulgar
opinion. As the ruin of convents had been foreſeen ſome years ere it
hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, the monks had taken care to diſſipate beforehand moſt of their
ſtock, furniture, and plate; ſo that the ſpoils of the great
monaſteries bore not, in theſe reſpects, any proportion to thoſe of the
leſſer.</p>
               <p>BESIDE the lands, poſſeſſed by the monaſteries, the
regular clergy enjoyed a conſiderable part of the benefices of England, and
of the tythes, annexed to them; and theſe were alſo at this time
transferred to the crown, and by that means came into the hands of laymen: An
abuſe which many zealous churchmen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard as the moſt criminal
ſacrilege. The monks were formerly much at their eaſe in England, and
enjoyed revenues, which much exceeded the regular and ſtated expence of the
houſe. We read of the abbey of Chertſey in Surrey, which poſſeſt 744
pounds a year, tho' it contained only fourteen monks: That of Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in
the county of Lincoln, was valued at 960 pounds a year, and contained but
thirty monks<note n="§" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. i. p. 237.</note>. In
order to diſſipate their revenues, and ſupport popularity, the
monaſteries lived in a very hoſpitable manner; and beſides the poor,
main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0429000101:229"/> from their offals, there were many decayed
gentlemen, who paſſed their lives in travelling from convent to convent,
and were entirely ſubſiſted at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the friars. By this
hoſpitality, as much as by their own inactivity, did the convents prove
nurſeries of idleneſs; but the King, not to give offence by too ſudden an
innovation, bound the new proprietors of abbey lands, to ſupport the ancient
hoſpitality. But this engagement was fulfilled in very few places, and for a
very ſhort time.</p>
               <p>IT is eaſy to imagine the indignation with which intelligence
of all theſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences was received at Rome; and how much the
eccleſiaſtics of that court, who had ſo long kept the world in
ſubjection by big ſounding epithets, and by holy execrations, would now
vent their rhetoric againſt the character and conduct of Henry. The pope was
provoked at laſt to publiſh the bull, which he had paſſed againſt
that monarch; and in a public manner delivered over his ſoul to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and his dominions to the firſt invader. Libels were diſperſed, where he
was compared to the moſt furious perſecutors in antiquity; and the
preference was even given on their ſide: He had declared war with the dead,
whom the pagans themſelves reſpected; was at open enmity with heaven; and
had engaged in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed hoſtility with the whole hoſt of ſaints and
angels. Above all, he was often reproached with his reſemblance to the
emperor Julian, whom, it was ſaid, he imitated in his apoſtacy and
learning, tho' he fell ſhort of him in his morals. Henry could
diſtinguiſh in many of theſe libels the ſtile and animoſity of his
kinſman, Pole; and he was thence anew incited to vent his rage, by every
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible expedient, on that famous cardinal.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cardinal Pole.</note> REGINALD de la Pole, or
Reginald Pole, was deſcended of the royal family, being fourth ſon of the
counteſs of Saliſbury, daughter of the duke of Clarence. He diſcovered in
very early youth evident ſymptoms of that fine genius, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
diſpoſition, by which, during his whole life, he was ſo much
diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and Henry having conceived great friendſhip for him,
propoſed to raiſe him to the higheſt eccleſiaſtical dignities; and,
as a pledge of future favours, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him the deanry of Exeter<note n="†" place="bottom">Goodwin's Annals.</note>, in order to help him to bear the
expences of his education. Pole was carrying on his ſtudies in Paris, at the
time when the King ſollicited the ſuffrages of that univerſity in favour
of his divorce; but tho' applied to by the Engliſh agent, he declined taking
any part in that affair. Henry bore this neglect with more temper than was
natural to him; and he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unwilling, on that account, to renounce
friendſhip with a perſon, whoſe virtues and talents, he hoped, would
prove uſeful, as well as ornamental, to his court and kingdom. He allowed him
ſtill to poſſeſs his deanry, and gave him <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0429000101:230"/>
permiſſion to finiſh his ſtudies at Padua: He even paid him ſome
court, in order to bring him into his meaſures; and wrote to him, while in
Italy, deſiring him to give his opinion freely, with regard to the late
meaſures taken in England, for aboliſhing the papal authority. Pole had now
entered into an intimate friendſhip with whatever was eminent for dignity or
merit in Italy; Sadolet, Bembo, and other revivers of true taſte and
learning; and he was moved by theſe connections, as well as by religious
zeal, to forget, in ſome reſpect, the duty which he owed to Henry, his
benefactor, and his ſovereign. He replied, by writing a treatiſe of <hi>the
unity of the church,</hi> where he inveighed againſt the King's ſupremacy,
his divorce, his ſecond marriage; and even exhorted the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to revenge
on him the injury done to his family, and to the catholic cauſe. Henry, tho'
provoked beyond meaſure at this outrage, diſſembled his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and ſent a meſſage to Pole, deſiring him to return to England, in order
to explain certain paſſages in his book, which he found ſomewhat
obſcure and difficult: But Pole was on his guard againſt this inſidious
invitation; and was determined to remain in Italy, where he was extremely
beloved and eſteemed by all the world.</p>
               <p>THE pope and emperor thought themſelves obliged to provide for
a man of Pole's eminence and dignity, who, in ſupport of their cauſe, had
ſacrificed all his pretenſions to fortune in his own country. He was
created a cardinal; and tho' he never took higher orders than thoſe of a
deacon, he was ſent legate into Flanders about the year 1536<note n="*" place="bottom">Herbert.</note>. Henry was ſenſible, that Pole's chief
intention in chooſing that employment, was to foment the mutinous
diſpoſition of the Engliſh catholics; and he therefore remonſtrated in
ſuch a vigorous manner with the queen of Hungary, regent of the Low
Countries, that ſhe diſmiſſed the legate, without allowing him to
exerciſe his commiſſion. The enmity which he bore Pole, was now open, as
well as violent; and the cardinal, on his part, kept no farther meaſures in
his intrigues againſt Henry. He is even ſuſpected of aſpiring to the
crown, by means of a marriage with the lady Mary; and the King was every day
alarmed by informations, which he received, of the correſpondence maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in England by that fugitive. Courtney, marquis of Exeter, had entered into a
conſpiracy with him; Sir Edward Nevil, brother to the lord Abergavenny, Sir
Nicholas Carew, maſter of horſe, and knight of the garter; Henry de la
Pole, lord Montacute, and Sir Geoffrey de la Pole, brothers to the cardinal.
Theſe perſons were indicted, and tried, and convicted, before lord Audley,
who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in the trial, as lord high ſteward. They were all executed,
except Sir Geoffrey de la Pole, who was pardoned; and he owed this grace to his
having <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0429000101:231"/> firſt carried to the King ſecret intelligence

preſume, that ſufficient evidence was produced againſt the marquis of

               </argument>
               <p>THE rough hand of Henry ſeemed well adapted for rending
aſunder thoſe bands, by which the ancient ſuperſtition had faſtened
itſelf on the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and tho', after renouncing the pope's ſupremacy,
and ſuppreſſing monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, moſt of the political ends of a
reformation were already attained, few people expected, that he would ſtop at
thoſe innovations. The ſpirit of oppoſition, it was thought, would carry
him to the utmoſt extremity againſt the church of Rome; and lead him to
declare war againſt the whole doctrine and worſhip, as well as
diſcipline, of that mighty hierarchy. He had formerly appealed from the pope
to a general council; but now, that a general council was ſummoned to meet at
Mantua, he previouſly renounced all ſubmiſſion to it, as being
ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the pope, and lying entirely under ſubjection to that
ſpiritual uſurper. He engaged his clergy to make a declaration to the like
purpoſe; and he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to them many other alterations on ancient
tenets and practices. Cranmer took advantage of every opportunity to carry him
on in this courſe; and while Queen Jane lived, who favoured the reformers, he
had, by means of her inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and addreſs, been very ſucceſsful in
his endeavours. After her death, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0429000101:232"/> who was
returned from his embaſſy to France, kept the King more in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence;
and by feigning an unlimited ſubmiſſion to his will, he was frequently
able to guide him to his own purpoſes. Fox, biſhop of Hereford, had
ſupported Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in his ſchemes for a more entire reformation; but his
death had made way for the promotion of Bonner, who, tho' he had hitherto
ſeemed a furious enemy to the ſee of Rome, was determined to ſacrifice
every thing to preſent intereſt, and had joined the confederacy of Gardiner
and the partizans of the old religion. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner himſelf, it was believed,
had ſecretly entered into meaſures with the pope, and even with the
emperor; and in concert with theſe powers, he endeavoured to preſerve, as
much as poſſible, the ancient faith and worſhip.</p>
               <p>HENRY was ſo much governed by paſſion, that nothing could
have retarded his animoſity and oppoſition againſt Rome, but ſome other
paſſion, which ſtopped his career, and raiſed him new ſubjects of
animoſity. Tho' he had gradually, ſince he came to years of maturity, been
changing the tenets of that theological ſyſtem, in which he had been
educated, he was equally poſitive and dogmatical in the few articles which
remained to him, as if the whole fabric had continued entire and unſhaken:
And tho' he ſtood alone in his opinion, the flattery of courtiers had ſo
enflamed his tyrannical arrogance, that he thought himſelf enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to
regulate, by his own particular ſtandard, the religious faith of the whole
nation. The point, where he chiefly placed his orthodoxy, happened to be the
real preſence; that very doctrine, in which, among the numberleſs victories
of ſuperſtition over common ſenſe, her triumph is the moſt ſignal
and egregious. All departure from this principle he held to be heretical and
deteſtable; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he thought, would be more honourable for him, than,
while he broke off all connections with the Roman pontiff, to maintain, in this
eſſential article, the purity of the catholic faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Diſputation with Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</note> THERE was
one Lambert<note n="*" place="bottom">Fox, vol. II. p. 396.</note>, a
ſchool-maſter in London, who had been queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for unſound opinions
by archbiſhop Warham; but, upon the death of that prelate, and the changing
of councils at court, he had been releaſed. Not terrified with the danger
which he had incurred, he ſtill continued to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgate his tenets; and
having heard Dr. Taylor, afterwards biſhop of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln, defend in a ſermon
the corporal preſence, he could not forbear expreſſing to Taylor his
diſſent from that doctrine; and he drew up his objections under ten
ſeveral head. Taylor carried the paper to Dr. Barnes, who happened to be a
Lutheran, and who maintained, that, tho' the ſubſtance of bread and wine
remained in the ſacrament, yet the real body and blood of Chriſt were there
alſo, and were, in a certain myſterious manner, incorporated with the
material ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <pb n="228" facs="tcp:0429000101:233"/> By the preſent laws and practice,
Barnes was no leſs expoſed to the ſtake than Lambert; yet ſuch was the
perſecuting rage which prevailed, that he was determined to bring this man to
condign puniſhment; becauſe, in their common departure from the ancient
faith, he had dared to go one ſtep farther than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He engaged Taylor
to delate Lambert to Cranmer and Latimer, who, whatever their private opinion
might be on theſe points, were obliged to conform themſelves to the
ſtandard of orthodoxy, eſtabliſhed by Henry. When Lambert was cited
before theſe prelates, they endeavoured to bend him to a recantation; and
they were ſurprized, when, inſtead of compliance, he ventured to appeal to
the King.</p>
               <p>THE King, not diſpleaſed with an opportunity, where he could
at once exert his ſupremacy, and diſplay his learning, accepted the appeal;
and was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to mix, in a very unfair manner, the diſputant with the
judge. Public notice was given, that he intended to enter the liſts with this
ſchool-maſter: Scaffolds were erected in Weſtminſter-hall, for the
accommodation of the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Henry appeared on his throne, accompanied with
all the enſigns of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty: The prelates were placed on his right hand:
The temporal peers on his left. The judges and moſt eminent lawyers had a
place aſſigned them behind the biſhops: The courtiers of greateſt
diſtinction behind the peers: And in the midſt of this ſplendid
aſſembly was produced the unhappy Lambert, and he was required to defend
his opinions againſt his royal antagoniſt<note n="†" place="bottom">Fox, vol. II. p. 426.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE biſhop of Chicheſter opened the conference, by ſaying,
that Lambert, being charged with heretical pravity, had appealed from his
biſhop to the King; as if he expected more favour from this application, and
as if the King could ever be induced to protect a heretic: That tho' his
majeſty had thrown off the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of the ſee of Rome; had
diſincorporated ſome idle monks, who lived like drones in a beehive; had
remedied the idolatrous worſhip of images; had publiſhed the bible in
Engliſh, for the inſtruction of all his ſubjects; and had made ſome
leſſer alterations, which every one muſt approve of; yet was he
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to maintain the purity of the catholic faith, and to puniſh with
the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſeverity all departure from it: And that he had taken the
preſent opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, before ſo learned and grave an auditory, of
convincing Lambert of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; but if he ſtill perſevered obſtinately
in them, he muſt expect the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign puniſhment<note n="‡" place="bottom">Goodwin's Annals.</note>.</p>
               <p>AFTER this preamble, which was not very encouraging, the King
aſked Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, with a ſtern countenance, what his opinion was of
Chriſt's corporal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the ſacrament of the altar; and when
Lambert began his diſcourſe with <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0429000101:234"/> ſome compliment
to his majeſty, he rejected the praiſe with diſdain and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He
afterwards preſſed Lambert with ſome arguments, drawn from ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and the ſchoolmen: The audience applauded the force of his reaſoning, and
the extent of his erudition: Cranmer ſeconded his proofs by ſome new
topics: Gardiner entered the liſts as a ſupport to Cranmer: Tonſtal took
up the argument after Gardiner: Stokeſley brought freſh aid to Tonſtal:
Six biſhops more appeared ſucceſſively in the field after Stockeſley.
And the diſputation, if it deſerves the name, was prolonged for five hours;
till Lambert, fatigued, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, brow-beaten, and abaſhed, was at laſt
reduced to ſilence. The King then, returning to the charge, aſked him
whether he was convinced; and he propoſed, as a concluding argument, this
intereſting queſtion, whether he was reſolved to live or die? Lambert,
who poſſeſſed that courage which conſiſts in obſtinacy, replied,
that he caſt himſelf wholly on his majeſty's clemency: The King told him,
that he would be no protector of heretics; and therefore, if that was his final
anſwer, he muſt expect to be committed to the flames. Cromwel, as
vicegerent, read the ſentence againſt him<note n="*" place="bottom">Collier,

<q rend="inline">"The King's majeſty," ſays Cromwel, "for

hall, and there preſided at the diſputation, proceſs and judgment of a

exerciſed there the very office of ſupreme head of the church of England.
How benignly his grace eſſayed to convert the miſerable man: How ſtrong
and manifeſt reaſons his highneſs alledged againſt him. I wiſh the
princes and potentates of Chriſtendom to have had a meet place to have ſeen
it. Undoubtedly they ſhould have much marvelled at his majeſty's moſt
high wiſdom and judgment, and reputed him no other wiſe after the ſame,
than in a manner the mirror and light of all other Kings and princes in
Chriſtendom."</q> It was by ſuch flatteries, that Henry was engaged to make
his ſentiments the ſtandard to all mankind; and was determined to enforce,
by the ſevereſt penalties, his <hi>ſtrong and manifeſt</hi> reaſons
for tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</note>.</p>
               <p>LAMBERT, whoſe vanity had probably incited him the more to
perſevere on account of the greatneſs of this public appearance, was not
daunted by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of that puniſhment, to which he was condemned. His
executioners took care to make the ſufferings of a man who had perſonally
oppoſed the King, as cruel as poſſible: He was burned at a ſlow fire;
his legs and thighs were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to the ſtumps; and when there appeared
no end of his tortures, ſome of the guards, more merciful than the reſt,
lifted him on their halberts, and threw him into the flames, where he was
conſumed. While they were employed in this <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0429000101:235"/> friendly
office, he cried aloud ſeveral times, <hi>None but Chriſt, none but
Chriſt,</hi> and theſe words were in his mouth when he expired<note n="†" place="bottom">Fox's acts and monuments, p. 427. Burnet.</note>.</p>
               <p>SOME few days before this execution, four Dutch anabaptiſts,
three men and a woman, had faggots tied to their backs at Paul's croſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

of the Engliſh, during that age, that when they laboured under any grievance,
they had not the ſatisfaction of expecting redreſs from Parliament: On the
contrary, they had reaſon to dread each meeting of that aſſembly, and
were then ſure of having tyranny converted into law, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated,
perhaps, with ſome circumſtance, which the arbitrary prince and his

<note place="margin">A Parliament.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">28th April.</note> This abject ſervility
never more eminently appeared than in a new Parliament, which the King now
aſſembled, and which, if he had ſo pleaſed, might have been the laſt
that ever ſat in England. But he found them too uſeful inſtruments of
dominion ever to entertain thoughts of giving them a total excluſion.</p>
               <p>THE chancellor opened the Parliament by informing the houſe of
Lords, that it was his majeſty's earneſt deſire, to extirpate from his
kingdom all diverſity of opinions with regard to religion; and as this
enterprize was difficult and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, he deſired them to chuſe a
committee among themſelves, who might frame certain articles, and communicate
them afterwards to the Parliament. The lords named the vicar-general, Cromwel,
now created a peer, the archbiſhops of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury and York, the biſhops of
Durham, Carliſle, Worceſter, Bath and Wells, Bangor, and Ely. The houſe
might have ſeen what a hopeful taſk they were undertaking: This ſmall
committee itſelf was agitated with ſuch diverſity of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that it
could come to no concluſion. The duke of Norfolk then moved in the houſe,
that, ſince there were no hopes of having a report from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, the
articles of faith, propoſed to be eſtabliſhed, ſhould be reduced to
ſix; and new committees be appointed to frame an act with regard to them. As
this peer was underſtood to ſpeak the King's mind, his motion was
immediately aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to; and, after a ſhort prorogation, the bill of the
<hi>ſix articles,</hi> or the bloody bill, as the proteſtants juſtly
termed it, was introduced, and having paſſed the two houſes, had the
King's aſſent affixed to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Law of the ſix articles.</note> IN this
law, the real preſence was eſtabliſhed, the communion in one kind, the
perpetual obligation of vows of chaſtity, the utility of private maſſes,
the <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0429000101:236"/> celibacy of the clergy, the neceſſity of
auricular confeſſion. The denial of the firſt article, with regard to the
real preſence, ſubjected the perſon to death by fire, and to the ſame

the other five articles, even tho' recanted, was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable by the
forfeiture of goods and chattels, and impriſonment during the King's
pleaſure: An obſtinate adherence to error, or a relapſe, was adjudged to
be felony, and puniſhable with death. The marriage of prieſts was
ſubjected to the ſame puniſhment: Their commerce with women, for the
firſt offence, was forfeiture and impriſonment; for the ſecond, death.
Abſtaining from confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and from receiving the euchariſt at the
accuſtomed times, ſubjected the perſon to fine and impriſonment, during
the King's pleaſure; and if the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal perſevered after conviction, he
was puniſhable by death and forſeiture, as in caſes of felony<note n="*" place="bottom">31 Hen. VIII. c. 14. Herbert in Kennet, p. 219.</note>.
Commiſſioners were to be appointed by the King, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into theſe
hereſies and irregular practices, and the criminals were to be tried by a
jury.</p>
               <p>THE King, in framing this law, laid his oppreſſive hand on
both parties; and even the catholics had reaſon to complain, that the friars
and nuns, tho' diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed their convent, ſhould be capriciouſly
reſtrained to the practice of celibacy<note n="†" place="bottom">There
is a ſtory, that the duke of Norfolk, meeting, ſoon after this act was
paſſed, one of his chaplains, who was ſuſpected of favouring the
reformation, ſaid to him, 
<q rend="inline">"Now, Sir, what think you of the law to hinder
prieſts from having wives?"</q> 
                     <q rend="inline">"Yes, my lord," replies the chaplain, "you

                  </note>: But as the proteſtants were chiefly expoſed
to the ſeverity of the act, the miſery of adverſaries, according to the
uſual maxims of party, was regarded by the adherents to the ancient religion,
as their own proſperity and triumph. Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer had the courage to oppoſe
this bill in the houſe; and tho' the King deſired him to abſent

being convinced of the general rectitude of his intentions, gave him an
unuſual indulgence in that particular, and never allowed even a whiſper

ſtatute, to diſmiſs his wife, the niece of Oſiander, a famous divine of
Nuremburg<note n="‖" place="bottom">Herbert in Kennet, p. 210</note>; and
Henry, ſatisfied with this proof of ſubmiſſion, ſhowed him his former

Parliament having thus reſigned all their eccleſiaſtical liberties,
proceeded to an entire ſurrender of their civil; and without ſcruple or
deliberation they made by one act a total ſubverſion of the Engliſh
conſtitution. They gave to the King's proclamations the ſame force as to a
ſtatute enacted by Parliament; and to render the matter worſe, if
poſſible, they framed this law as if it were only declarative, and were
intended to explain the natural extent of the regal authority. The preamble
contains, that the King had formerly ſet forth ſeveral proclamations, which
froward perſons had wilfully contemned, not conſidering what a King by his

               <p>WHAT ſhows either a ſtupid or wilful blindneſs of the
Parliament; they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, even after this ſtatute, to maintain ſome
limitations in the government; and they enacted, that no proclamation ſhould
deprive any perſon of his lawful poſſeſſions, liberties,
inheritances, privileges, franchiſes; nor yet infringe any common law or
laudable cuſtom of the realm. They conſidered not, that no pains could be
inflicted on the diſobedience of proclamations, without invading ſome
liberty or property of the ſubject; and that the power of enacting new laws,
joined to the diſpenſing power, then exerciſed by the crown, amounted to
a full legiſlative authority. It is true, the Kings of England had been
always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, from their own authority, to iſſue proclamations, and
to exact obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them; and this prerogative was, no doubt, a ſtrong
ſymptom of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute government: But ſtill there was a difference between
a power, which was exerciſed on a particular emergence, and which muſt be
juſtified by the preſent expediency or neceſſity; and an authority
conferred by a poſitive ſtatute, which could no longer admit of controul or
limitation.</p>

COULD any act be more oppoſite to the ſpirit of liberty than this law, it
would have been another of the ſame parliament. They paſſed attainders,
not only <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0429000101:238"/> againſt the Marqueſs of Exeter, the Lords
Montacute, Darcy, Huſſey, and others, who had been legally tried and
condemned; but alſo againſt ſome perſons, of the higheſt quality, who
had never been accuſed, or examined, or convicted. The violent hatred, which
Henry bore to cardinal Pole, had extended itſelf to all his friends and
relations; and his mother in particular, the counteſs of Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, had,
on that account, become extremely obnoxious to him. She was alſo accuſed of
having employed her authority with her tenants, to hinder them from peruſing
the new tranſlation of the Bible; of having procured bulls from Rome, which,
'tis ſaid, were found at Coudray, her country ſeat; of having kept a
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with her ſon, the cardinal: But Henry found, either that
theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences could not be proved, or that they would not by law be
ſubject to ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere puniſhment as he deſired to inflict upon her.
He reſolved, therefore, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt her in a more ſummary and
more tyrannical manner; and for that purpoſe, he ſent Cromwel, who was but
too obſequious to his will, to demand of the judges, whether the Parliament
could attaint a perſon, who was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, without giving him any trial,
or citing him to appear before them<note n="*" place="bottom">Coke's 4th Inſt.
p. 37, 38.</note>. The judges replied, that it was a dangerous queſtion, and
that the high court of Parliament ought to give examples to inferior courts of
proceeding according to juſtice: No inferior court could act in that
arbitrary manner, and they thought that the parliament never would. Being
preſſed to give a more explicite anſwer, they replied, that, if a
perſon were attainted in that manner, the attainder could never after be
brought in queſtion, but muſt remain good in law. Henry learned by this
deciſion, that ſuch a method of proceeding, tho' directly contrary to all
the principles of equity, was yet practicable; and this being all he was
anxious to know, he reſolved to employ it againſt the counteſs of
Saliſbury. Cromwel ſhowed to the houſe of peers a banner, on which was
embroidered the five wounds of Chriſt, the ſymbol, choſen by the northern
rebels; and this banner, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, was found in the Counteſs's
houſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Rymer xiv. 652.</note>. No other proof
ſeems to have been produced, in order to aſcertain her guilt: The
Parliament, without farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, paſſed a bill of attainder againſt
her; and they involved in the ſame act, without any better proof, as far as
appears, Gertrude Marchioneſs of Exeter, Sir Adrian Forteſcue, and Sir
Thomas Dingley. Theſe two gentlemen were executed: The marchioneſs was
pardoned, and ſurvived the King; the counteſs received a reprieve.</p>
               <p>THE only beneficial act, paſſed this ſeſſion, was that
by which the parliament confirmed the ſurrender of the monaſteries; and yet
even this act contains much falſhood, much tyranny, and were it not that all
private rights muſt ſubmit to <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0429000101:239"/> public intereſt,
much injuſtice and iniquity. The ſcheme of engaging the abbots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
make a ſurrender of their monaſteries had been conducted, as may eaſily
be imagined, with many invidious circumſtances: Arts of all kinds had been
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed upon them; every motive, that could work on the frailty of human
nature, had been ſet before them; and it was with great difficulty that
theſe dignified con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventuals were brought to a conceſſion, which moſt
of them regarded as deſtructive of their intereſts, as well as ſacr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>legious and criminal in itſelf<note n="*" place="bottom">Collier,
vol. ii. p. 158. &amp; ſeq.</note>. Three abbots had ſhown more conſtancy
than the reſt, the abbot of Colcheſter, of Reading, and of Glaſſenbury;
and in order to puniſh them for their oppoſition, and make them an example
to others, means had been found to convict them of treaſon; they had
periſhed by the hands of the executioner, and the revenues of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
had been forfeited<note n="†" place="bottom">31 II. VIII. c. 10.</note>.
Beſides, tho' none of theſe violences had had place, the King knew, that a
ſurrender made by men, who were only tenants for life, would not bear
examination; and he was therefore reſolved to make all ſure by his uſual
expedient, an act of parliament. In the preamble to this act, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
aſſerts, that all the ſurrenders, made by the abbots, had been, 
<q rend="inline">"without conſtraint, of their own accord, and
according to the due courſe of common law."</q> And in conſequence, the
parliament confirms the ſurrenders, and aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the property of the
abbey lands to the King and his ſucceſſors for ever<note n="‡" place="bottom">31 H. VIII. c. 13.</note>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is remarkable, that all the
mitred abbots ſtill ſat in the houſe of peers; and that none of them made
any proteſtation againſt this ſtatute.</p>
               <p>IN this ſeſſion, the rank of all the great officers of
ſtate was fixed: Cromwel, as vicegerent, had the precedency aſſigned him
above all of them. It was thought ſingular, that a black-ſmith's ſon, for
he was no other, ſhould have precedence next the royal family; and that a man
poſſeſſed of no manner of literature, ſhould be placed at the head of
the church.</p>
               <p>AS ſoon as the act of the ſix articles had paſſed, the
catholics were extremely vigilant to inform againſt offenders; and no leſs
than five hundred perſons were in a little time thrown into priſon. But
Cromwel, who had not had intereſt enough to prevent that act, was able, for
the preſent, to elude its execution. Seconded by the Duke of Suffolk, and
lord chancellor Audley, as well as Cranmer, he remonſtrated againſt the
cruelty of puniſhing ſo many delinquents; and he obtained permiſſion to
ſet them at liberty. The uncertainty of the King's humour gave each party an
opportunity of triumphing in its turn. No ſooner had Henry paſſed this
law, which ſeemed to give ſo deep a wound to the reformers, than he granted
a general permiſſion, for every one to have the new tranſlation of the 
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0429000101:240"/> Bible in his family: A conceſſion regarded by that
party, as a moſt important victory.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Henry's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> BUT as
Henry was obſerved to be much governed by his wives, while he retained his
fondneſs for them, the final prevalence of either party, ſeemed to depend
much on the choice of the future Queen. Immediately after the death of Jane
Seymour, the moſt beloved of all his wives, he began to think of a new
marriage. He firſt caſt his eye on the dutcheſs dowager of Milan, niece
to the Emperor; and he made propoſals for obtaining that alliance. But
meeting with difficulties in this deſign, he was carried, by his friendſhip
for Francis, rather to think of a French princeſs. He demanded the dutcheſs
dowager of Longueville, daughter of the Duke of Guiſe, a prince of the
houſe of Lorraine; but Francis told him, that that lady was already betrothed
to the King of Scotland. The King, however, would not take a repulſe: He had
ſet his heart extremely on the match: The information, which he had received,
of the dutcheſs's accompliſhments and beauty, had prepoſſeſſed him
in her favour; and having privately ſent over Meautys to examine her
perſon, and get certain intelligence of her conduct, the accounts, which that
agent brought him, ſerved farther to inflame his deſires. He learned, that
ſhe was big made; and he thought her, on that account, the more proper match
for him, who was now become ſomewhat corpulent. The pleaſure too of
mortifying his nephew, whom he did not love, was a farther incitement to his
proſecution of this match; and he inſiſted, that Francis ſhould give
him the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the King of Scots. But Francis, tho' ſenſible that
the alliance of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was of much greater importance to his intereſt,
would not affront his friend and ally; and to prevent farther ſollicitation,
he immediately ſent the Princeſs to Scotland. Not to ſhock, however,
Henry's humour, Francis made him an offer of Mary of Bourbon, daughter of the
Duke of Vendome; but as the King was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that James had formerly
rejected this Princeſs, he would not hear any farther of ſuch a propoſal.
The French monarch then offered him the choice of the two younger ſiſters
of the new Queen of Scots; and he aſſured him, that they were no way
inferior either in merit or ſize to their elder ſiſter, and that one of
them was even ſuperior in beauty. The King was as ſcrupulous with regard to
the perſon of his wives, as if his heart had been really ſuſceptible of a
deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate paſſion; and he was unwilling to truſt any relations, or even
pictures, with regard to this important particular. He propoſed to Francis,
that they ſhould have a conference at Calais on pretence of buſineſs; and
that that monarch ſhould bring along with h m the two Princeſſes of
Guiſe, together with the fineſt ladies of quality in France, that he might
make a choice among them. But the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lante ſpirit of Francis was ſhocked
with this propoſal; and he was impreſſed with <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0429000101:241"/> too
much regard for the fair ſex, to carry ladies of the firſt quality, like
geldings, to a market, there to be choſen or rejected by the humour of the
merchant<note n="*" place="bottom">Le Grand, vol. iii. p. 638.</note>. Henry
would hearken to none of theſe niceties, but ſtill inſiſted on his
propoſal; which, however, notwithſtanding Francis's earneſt deſire of
continuing a good correſpondence with him, was at laſt finally
rejected.</p>
               <p>THE King began then to turn his thoughts towards a German
alliance; and as the princes of the Smalcaldic league were extremely
diſguſted againſt the Emperor on account of the perſecution of their
religion, he hoped, by matching himſelf into one of their families, to renew
an amity, which he regarded as ſo uſeful to him. Cromwel joyfully
ſeconded this intention; and propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed to him Anne of Cleves, whoſe father, the duke of that name,
had great intereſt among the Lutheran prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and whoſe ſiſter,
Sibylla, was married to the elector of Saxony, the head of the proteſtant
alliance. 
<note place="margin">He marries Anne of Cleves.</note> A flattering
picture, drawn for the Princeſs by Hans Holben, determined Henry to apply to
her father; and after ſome negotiations, the marriage, notwithſtanding the
oppoſition of the elector of Saxony, was at laſt concluded; and the
Princeſs was ſent over into England. The King, impatient to be ſatisfied
with regard to the perſon of his bride, came privately to Rocheſter, and
got a ſight of her. He found her big, indeed, and tall, as he could wiſh;
but utterly devoid both of beauty and grace; very unlike the pictures and
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations, which he had received: He ſwore ſhe was a great
Flanders-mare; and declared, that he never could poſſibly bear her any
affection. 
<note place="margin">Diſlikes her.</note> The matter was worſe,
when he found, that ſhe could ſpeak no language but Dutch, of which he was
entirely ignorant; and that the charms of her converſation were not likely to
compenſate for the homelineſs of her perſon. He returned to Greenwich
very melancholy; and much lamented his hard fate to Cromwel, as well as to Lord
Ruſſel, Sir Anthony Brown, and Sir Anthony Denny. This laſt gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
in order to give him comfort, told him, that his misfortune was common to
Kings, who could not, like private perſons, chooſe for themſelves; but
muſt receive their wives from the judgment and fancy of others.</p>
               <p>IT was the ſubject of debate among the King's counſellors,
whether the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage could not yet be broke; and the Princeſs be ſent back
to her own country. Henry's ſituation ſeemed at that time very critical.
After the ten years truce, concluded between the Emperor and the king of
France, a good underſtanding ſeemed to have taken place between theſe
rival monarchs; and ſuch marks of union appeared, as gave great jealouſy to
the court of England. The Emperor, who knew the generous nature of Francis,
even put a confidence in him, which is rare, to that degree, among great
princes. An inſurrection had been raiſed in the Low <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0429000101:242"/>
Countries by the inhabitants of Ghent, and ſeemed to threaten the moſt
danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſequences. Charles, who reſided at that time in Spain,
reſolved to go in perſon to Flanders, in order to appeaſe theſe
diſorders; but he found great difficulties in contriving the manner of his
paſſage thither. The road by Italy and Germany was tedious: The voyage
thro' the Channel dangerous, by reaſon of the Engliſh naval power: He
aſked Francis's permiſſion to paſs thro' his dominions; and he
entruſted himſelf into the hands of a rival, whom he had ſo mortally
offended. The French monarch received him at Paris, with great magnificence and
cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy; and tho' prompted both by revenge and intereſt, as well as by
the advice of his miſtreſs and favourites, to make advantage of the
preſent opportunity, he conducted the Emperor ſafely out of his dominions;
and would not ſo much as ſpeak to him of buſineſs during his abode in
France, leſt his demands ſhould bear the air of violence upon his royal
gueſt.</p>
               <p>HENRY, who was informed of all theſe particulars, believed
that an entire and cordial union had taken place between theſe two great
monarchs; and that their religious zeal might prompt them to fall with combined
arms upon Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<note n="*" place="bottom">Stowe, p. 579.</note>. An alliance
with the German princes ſeemed now, more than ever, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for his
intereſt and ſafety; and he knew, that, if he ſent back the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of Cleves, ſuch an affront would be highly reſented by her friends and
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. <label type="milestone">

notwithſtanding his averſion to her, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the marriage; and he told
Cromwel, that, ſince matters had gone ſo far, he muſt put his neck into
the yoke. Cromwel, who knew how much his own intereſt was concerned in this
affair, was very anxious to learn from the King, next morning after the
marriage, whether he now liked his ſpouſe any better. The King told him,
that he hated her worſe than ever; and that her perſon was more lothſome
on a near approach: He was reſolved never to meddle with her; and even
ſuſpected her not to be a true maid: A point, about which he had
entertained an extreme delicacy. He continued however to be civil to Anne; he
even ſeemed to repoſe his uſual confidence in Cromwel; but tho' he
exerted this command over his temper, a diſcontent lay lurking in his
breaſt, and was ready to burſt out on the firſt opportunity.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A Parliament.</note> A ſeſſion of
Parliament was held; and none of the abbots were now allowed a place in the
houſe of peers. The King, by the mouth of the chancellor, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the
Parliament of the great diverſity of religions, which ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
among his ſubjects: A grievance, he ſaid, which ought the leſs to be
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured; becauſe the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>riptures were now publiſhed in Engliſh, and ought
uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally to be the ſtandard of belief to all mankind. But he had
appointed, he <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0429000101:243"/> ſaid, ſome biſhops and divines to
draw up a liſt of tenets, to which his people were to aſſent; and he was
determined, that Chriſt, the doctrine of Chriſt, and the truth ſhould
have the victory. The King ſeems to have expected more effect in
aſcertaining truth, from this new book of his doctors, than had enſued from
the publication of the ſcriptures. Cromwel, as vicar general, made alſo in
the King's name a ſpeech to the upper houſe; and the peers, in return,
beſtowed ſuch flattery on him, that they ſaid he was worthy, by his
deſert, to be vicar ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the univerſe. That miniſter ſeemed to
be no leſs in his maſter's good graces: He received, ſoon after the
ſitting of the Parliament, the title of Earl of Eſſex, and was
inſtalled knight of the garter.</p>
               <p>THERE remained only one religious order in England; the knights
of St. John of Jeruſalem, or the knights of Malta, as they are commonly
called. This or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, partly eccleſiaſtical, partly military, had, by their
valour, done great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Chriſtendom; and had very much retarded, at
Jeruſalem, Rhodes, and Malta, the rapid progreſs of the barbarians. During
the general ſurrender of the religious houſes in England, they had exerted
their ſpirit, and had obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately refuſed to yield up their revenues to
the King; and Henry, who would endure no ſociety that profeſſed obedience
to the pope, was obliged to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Parliament for the
diſſolution of this order. Their revenues were large; and formed an
addition no way contemptible to the many acquiſitions, which the King had
already made. But he had very ill huſbanded the great revenue obtained by the
plunder of the church: His profuſe generoſity diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated faſter than
this rapacity could ſupply; and the Parliament were ſurprized this
ſeſſion to find a new demand made upon them of four tenths and a
ſubſidy of one ſhil ing in the pound during two years: So ill were the
people's expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations anſwered, that the crown was never more to require any
ſupply from the people. The commons, tho' laviſh of their liberty, and of
the blood of their fellow ſubjects, were extremely frugal of their money; and
it was not without difficulty that that grant could be obtained by this
abſolute and dreaded monarch. The convocation gave the King four ſhillings
in the pound to be levied in two years. The pretext for theſe grants was the
great expence, which Henry had been put to for the defence of the nation, in
building forts along the ſea coaſt, and in equipping a navy. As he had at
preſent no ally on the Continent, in whom he repoſed much confidence, he
relied only on his domeſtic ſtrength, and was on that account obliged to be
more expenſive in his preparations againſt the dangers of an
invaſion.</p>
               <p>THE King's favour to Cromwel, and his acquieſcence in the
marriage of Anne of Cleves, were b th of them deceitful appearances: His
averſion to the Queen ſecretly encreaſed every day; and having at laſt
broke all reſtraint, it prompted <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0429000101:244"/> him at once to ſeek
the diſſolution of a marriage ſo odious to him, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve his
miniſter in ruin, who had been the author of it. 
<note place="margin">Fall of Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</note> The fall of Cromwel
was haſtened by other cauſes. All the nobility hated a man, who, being of
ſuch baſe extraction, had not only mounted above them by his ſtation of
vicar ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but had engroſſed many of the other conſiderable offices
of the kingdom: Beſides that commiſſion, which gave him a high, and
almoſt abſolute authority over the clergy, and even over the laity, he was
Lord privy ſeal, Lord cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, and Maſter of the wards: He had alſo
obtained the order of the garter, a dignity which had ever been conferred only
on the moſt illuſtrious families, and which ſeemed to be profaned by its
being communicated to ſo mean a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The people were averſe to him,
as the ſuppoſed author of the violences on the monaſteries;
eſtabliſhments, which were ſtill revered and beloved by the commonalty.
The catholics regarded him as the concealed enemy of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: The
proteſtants, obſerving his exterior concurrence with all the
perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions exerciſed againſt them, were inclined to bear him as little
favour; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him with the timidity, if not treachery, of his
conduct. And the King, who found, that great clamours had on all hands arifen
againſt the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was not diſpleaſed to throw on Cromwel the
load of public hatred, and he hoped, by ſo eaſy a ſacriſice, to regain
the affections of his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>BUT there was another cauſe, which ſuddenly ſet all
theſe motives in action, and brought about an unexpected revolution in the
miniſtry. The King had fixed his affection on Catherine Howard, niece to the
Duke of Norfolk; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing determined to gratify this new paſſion, he
could find no other expedient but by procuring a divorce from his preſent
conſort, to raiſe Catherine to his bed and throne. The Duke, who had long
been engaged in enmity with Cromwel, made the ſame uſe of her
inſinuations, to ruin that miniſter, that he had formerly done of Anne
Boleyn's againſt Wolſey: And when all engines were prepared, he obtained a
commiſſion from the King, to arreſt Cromwel at the council-board on the
accuſation of high treaſon, and to commit him to the Tower. Immediately
after, a bill of attainder was framed againſt him; and the houſe of peers
thought proper, without trial, examination, or evidence, to condemn to death a
man, whom, a few days before, they had declared worthy to be vicar general of
the univerſe. The houſe of commons paſſed the bill, tho' not without
ſome oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Cromwel was accuſed of hereſy and treaſon; but the
inſtances of his treaſonable practices are utterly improbable, or even
abſolutely ridiculous<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. i. p. 278.</note>.
The only circumſtance of his conduct, by which he ſeems to have merited
this fate, <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0429000101:245"/> was his being the inſtrument of the King's
tyranny, in conducting like iniquitous bills, in the former ſeſſion,
againſt the counteſs of Saliſbury and others.</p>
               <p>CROMWEL endeavoured to ſoften the King by the moſt humble

purpoſe: It was not the practice of that Prince to ruin his miniſters and
favourites by halves; and tho' the unhappy priſoner wrote once in ſo moving
a ſtrain as even to draw tears from his eyes, he hardened himſelf againſt
all move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of pity, and refuſed his pardon. The concluſion of Cromwel's
letter ran in theſe words. 
<q rend="inline">"I a moſt woful priſoner, am ready to

would reſent on his ſon theſe ſymptoms of oppoſition to his will, and
that his death alone would not terminate that monarch's vengeance. He was a man
of prudence, induſtry, and ability; worthy of a better maſter and of a
better fate. Tho' raiſed to the ſummit of power from a very low origin, he
betrayed no inſolence or contempt of his inferiors; and was careful to
remember all the obligations, which, during his lower fortune, he had owed to
any one. He had ſerved as a private ſentinel in the Italian wars, where he
received ſome good office from a Lucqueſe merchant, who had entirely forgot
his perſon, as well as the ſervice, which he had rendered him. Cromwel, in

THE meaſures for divorcing the King from Anne of Cleves, were carried on at
the ſame time with the bill of attainder againſt Cromwel. The houſe of
peers, in conjunction with the commons, applied to him by petition, deſiring
that he would allow his marriage to be examined; and orders were immediately
given to lay the matter before the convocation. Anne had been formerly
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by her father to the Duke of Lorrain; but ſhe, as well as the
Duke, were at that time under age, and the contract had been afterwards
annulled by the conſent of both parties. The King, however, pleaded this
contract as a ground of divorce; and he added two reaſons more, which may
ſeem a little extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; that, when he eſpouſed Anne, he had not
inwardly given his conſent, <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0429000101:246"/> and that he had not
conſummated the marriage. The convocation were ſatisfied with theſe
reaſons, and ſolemnly annulled the marriage between the King and Queen: The
Parliament ratified the deciſion of the clergy<note n="‡" place="bottom">To ſhow how much Henry ſported with law and common ſenſe;
how ſervilely the Parliament followed all his caprices; and how much both of
them were loſt to all ſentiment of ſhame; an act was paſſed this
ſeſſion, declaring, that a precontract ſhould be no ground of annulling
a marriage; as if that pretext had not been made uſe of both in the caſe of
Anne Boleyn and Anne of Cleves. But the King's intention in this law is ſaid
to be a deſign of reſtoring the princeſs Elizabeth to her right of
le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimacy; and it was his character never to look farther than the preſent
object, without regarding the inconſiſtency of his conduct. The Parliament
made it high treaſon to deny the diſſolution of Henry's marriage with
Anne of Cleves. Herbert.</note>; and the ſentence was ſoon after notified
to that princeſs.</p>
               <p>ANNE was bleſt with a happy inſenſibility of temper, even
in the points which the moſt nearly affect her ſex; and the King's
averſion towards her, as well as his proſecution of the divorce, had never
given her the leaſt uneaſineſs. She willingly hearkened to terms of
compoſition with him; and when he offered to adopt her as his ſiſter, to
give her place next the Queen, and his own daughter, and to make a ſettlement
of three thouſand pounds a year upon her; ſhe accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the conditions, and
gave her conſent to the divorce<note n="*" place="bottom">Herbert, p. 458,
459.</note>. She even wrote to her brother, (for her father was dead) that
ſhe had been very well uſed in England, and deſired him to live on good
terms with the King. The only inſtance of pride which ſhe betrayed was,
that ſhe refuſed to return into her own country after the affront which
ſhe had received; and ſhe lived and died in England.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING Anne's moderation, this incident produced a
great cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between the King and the German princes; but as the
ſituation of Europe was now much altered, Henry was the more indifferent to
their reſentment. The cloſe intimacy which had taken place between Francis
and Charles, had ſubſiſted during a very ſhort time: The
diſſimilarity of their characters ſoon renewed, with greater violence
than ever, their former jealouſy and hatred. While Charles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at
Paris, Francis had been imprudently engaged, by his open temper, and by that
ſatisfaction which a noble mind naturally feels in performing generous
actions, to make ſome very dangerous confidences to that intereſted
monarch; and having now loſt all ſuſpicion of his rival, he hoped, that
the emperor and he, ſupporting each other, might neglect every other
alliance. He not only communicated to his gueſt the ſtate of his
negociations with Sultan Solyman and the Venetians: He alſo laid open the

confederacy againſt him<note n="*" place="bottom">Pere Daniel, Du

ſhewed himſelf unworthy of the friendly reception which he had met with. He
flatly refuſed to execute his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and put the duke of Orleans in
poſſeſſion of the Milaneſe: He informed So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman, and the ſenate of
Venice, of the treatment which they had received from their ally: And he took
care that Henry ſhould not be ignorant how willingly Francis had abandoned
his ancient friend, to whom he owed ſuch important ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, and had
ſacrificed him to a new confederate: He even poiſoned and
miſrepreſented many things, which the unſuſpecting heart of the French
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch had diſcloſed to him. Had Henry poſſeſſed true judgment
and generoſity, this incident alone had been ſufficient to guide him in the
choice of his allies. But his domineering pride carried him immediately to
renounce the friendſhip of Francis, who had ſo unexpectedly given the
emperor the preference: And as Charles invited him to a renewal of ancient
amity, he willingly accepted the offer; and thinking himſelf ſecure in this
alliance, he neglected the friendſhip both of France and of the German
princes.</p>

had taken with regard to foreign affairs, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely agreeable to his

their antagoniſts. 
<note place="margin">His marriage with Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Howard.</note>
The marriage of the King with Catherine Howard, which followed ſoon after his
divorce from Anne of Cleves, was alſo regarded as a very favourable incident
to their cauſe; and the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent events correſponded perfectly to
their expectations. The King's councils being now directed by Norfolk and
Gardiner, a ſurious perſecution commenced againſt the proteſtants; and
the law of the ſix articles was executed with rigour. Dr. Barnes, who had
been the cauſe of Lambert's execution, felt, in his turn, the ſeverity of
the perſecuting ſpirit; and, by a bill which paſſed in parliament,
without trial, he was condemned to the flames, together with Jerome and
Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard. He diſcuſſed theological queſtions even at the ſtake; and
as the debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the ſheriff, turned upon the invocation of
ſaints, he ſaid, that he doubted whether the ſaints could pray for us;
but if they could, he hoped in half an hour, to be praying for the ſheriff

this tyrannical equity and impartiality, which reduced both parties to
ſubjection, and infuſed terror into every breaſt. Barnes, Gerrard, and
Jerome had been carried to the place of execution on three hurdles; and along
with them there was placed on each hurdle a catholic, who was alſo exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for his religion. Theſe catholics were Abel, Fetherſtone, and Powel, who
declared, that the moſt grievous part of their puniſhment was the being
coupled to ſuch heretical miſcreants as ſuffered with them<note n="‖" place="bottom">Saunders de ſchiſm. Angl.</note>.</p>
               <p>THO' the ſpirit of the Engliſh ſeemed to be totally ſunk
under the deſpotic power of Henry, there appeared ſome ſymptoms of
diſcontent: An incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable inſurrection broke out in Yorkſhire,
headed by Sir John Nevil; but it was ſoon ſuppreſſed, and Nevil, with
the other ringleaders, was executed. The rebels were ſuppoſed to have been
inſtigated by the intrigues of cardinal Pole; and the King was inſtantly
determined to make the counteſs of Saliſbury ſuffer for her ſon's
offences.

it the beſt way he could: And thus ſhaking her venerable grey locks, ſhe
ran about the ſcaffold; and the executioner followed her with his ax, aiming
many fruitleſs blows at her neck, before he was able to give her the fatal
ſtroke. Thus periſhed the laſt of the line of Plantagenet, which, with
great glory, but ſtill greater crimes and misfortunes, had governed England
for the ſpace of three hundred years. The lord Leonard Grey, a man who had
formerly rendered great ſervice to the crown, was alſo beheaded for
treaſon, ſoon after the counteſs of Saliſbury. We know little of the
grounds of his proſecution.</p>
               <p>THE inſurrection in the North engaged Henry to make a

them to his government, and to aboliſh the ancient ſuperſtitions, to

fears, and perſecutions. About the year 1527, Patrick Hamilton, a young man
of a noble family, having been created abbot of Ferne, was ſent abroad for
his education; but had fallen into company with ſome reformers, and he
returned into his own country very ill diſpoſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that church, of
which his birth and his merit entitled him to attain the higheſt honours. The
fervour of youth, and his zeal for novelty, made it impoſſible for him to
conceal his ſentiments; and Campbel, prior of the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans, who, under
colour of friendſhip, and a ſympathy in opinion, had inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
himſelf into his confidence, delated him to Beaton, archbiſhop of St.

nature, the conference ended with their condemning Hamilton to be burnt for his
errors. The young man, who had been deaf to the inſinuations of ambition, was
leſs likely to be ſhaken with the fears of death, while he propoſed to
himſelf both the glory of bearing teſtimony to the truth, and the immediate
reward at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his martyrdom. The people, who compaſſionated his youth,
his virtue, and his noble birth, were much moved with the conſtancy of his
end; and the event ſtill more confirmed them in their favourable ſentiments
towards him. He cited Campbel, who ſtill inſulted him at the ſtake, to
anſwer before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat of Chriſt; and as that perſecutor,
either aſtoniſhed with theſe events, or overcome with remorſe, or,

               <p>AMONG the diſciples converted by Hamilton, was one friar

               <p>THE clergy were at that time reduced to great difficulties, not
only in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but all over Europe. As the reformers aimed at a total
ſubverſion of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent eſtabliſhments, which they repreſented as
idolatrous, impious, deteſtable, the prieſts, who found both their honours
and properties at ſtake, thought that they had a right to reſiſt, by
every extremity, theſe dangerous invaders, and that the ſame ſimple
principles of equity, which juſtified a man in killing a pyrate or a robber,
would acquit them for the execution of ſuch heretics. A toleration, tho' it
is never acceptable to ecclefiaſtics, might, they ſaid, be admitted in
other caſes; but ſeemed an abſurdity where fundamentals were ſhaken,
and where the poſſeſſions, and even the ſubſiſtence of the
eſtabliſhed clergy were brought in danger. But tho' the church was thus
carried by policy, as well as inclination, to kindle the fires of
perſecution, they found the ſucceſs of this remedy very precarious, and
obſerved, that the enthuſiaſtic zeal of the reformers, inflamed by
puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was apt to prove very contagious on the compaſſionate minds
of the ſpectators. The new doctrine, amidſt all the dangers to which it was
expoſed, ſpread itſelf ſecretly every where; and the minds of men were
gradually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to a revolution in religion.</p>
               <p>BUT the moſt dangerous ſymptom for the clergy in Scotland
was, that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, moved by the example of England, had caſt a
wiſtful eye on the church revenues, and hoped, if a reformation took place,
to enrich themſelves by the plunder of the eccleſiaſtics. James
himſelf, who was very poor, and was ſomewhat inclined to magnificence,
particularly in building, had been ſwayed by like motives; and began to
threaten the clergy with the ſame fate which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them in the
neighbouring country. Henry alſo, never ceaſed exhorting his nephew to
imitate his example; and being moved both by the pride of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proſelytes,
and the proſpect of ſecurity, if Scotland ſhould embrace a cloſe union
with him, he ſollicited the King of Scots to meet him at York; and he
obtained a promiſe to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>THE eccleſiaſtics were extremely alarmed with this
reſolution of James; and they employed every expedient, in order to prevent
it. They repreſented the dangers of innovation; the pernicious conſequences
of aggrandizing the nobility, already too powerful; the hazard of putting
himſelf into the hands of the Engliſh, his hereditary enemies; the
dependance which muſt enſue upon loſing the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of France, and
all foreign potentates. To theſe conſiderations, they added the proſpect
of preſent intereſt, by which they found the King to be much go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned: 
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0429000101:251"/> They offered him a preſent gratuity of fifty
thouſand pounds Scots: They promiſed him, that the church ſhould always
be ready to contribute to his ſupply: And they pointed out to him, the
confiſcations of heretics, as the means of filling his exchequer, and of
adding a hundred thouſand pounds a year to the crown revenues<note n="*" place="bottom">Buchanan, lib. XIV. Drummond in Ja. 5. Pitſcoti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>HENRY, vexed with the diſappointment, and enraged at the
affront, vowed vengeance againſt his nephew; and he began, by permitting
pyracies at ſea, and incurſions at land, to put his threats in execution.
But he received ſoon after, in his own family, an affront to which he was
much more ſenſible, and which touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in a point where he had always
ſhewn an extreme delicacy. He had thought himſelf very happy in his new
marriage: The youth, beauty, and agreeable diſpoſition of Catherine, had
entirely captivated his affections; and he made no ſecret of his devoted
attachment to her. He had even put up a prayer in his chappel, returning thanks
to heaven for the felicity which the conjugal ſtate afforded him; and he
deſired the biſhop of Lincoln to compoſe a form of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving for
that purpoſe. 
<note place="margin">Diſcovery of the Queen's crimes.</note> But
the Queen very little merited this tenderneſs which he bore her: She had
abandoned herſelf to lewdneſs. One Laſcelles brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of her

ſervant in the old dutcheſs of Norfolk's family, with whom Catherine was

ſervants of the dutcheſs, had been admitted to her bed; and ſhe had even
taken little care to conceal her ſhame from the other ſervants of the
family. The primate, ſtruck with this intelligence, which it was equally
dangerous to conceal or to diſcover, communicated the matter to the earl of
Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford and to the chancellor. They agreed, that the matter ſhould by no
means be buried in ſilence; and the archbiſhop himſelf ſeemed the
moſt proper perſon to diſcloſe it to the King. Cranmer, unwilling to
ſpeak on ſo delicate a ſubject, wrote a narrative of the whole, and
conveyed it to Henry, who was infinitely aſtoniſhed at the intelligence. So
confident was he of the fidelity of his conſort, that he gave at firſt no
credit to the information; and he ſaid to the lord privy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeal, to lord
Ruſſel, high admiral, Sir Anthony Brown, and Wriotheſley, that he
regarded the whole as a forgery. Cranmer was now in a very perilous
ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and had not full proofs been found, certain and inevitable
deſtruction hung <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0429000101:252"/> over him. The King's impatience,
however, and jealouſy prompted him to ſearch the matter to the bottom: The
privy-ſeal was ordered to examine Laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles, who perſiſted in the
information he had given; and ſtill appealed to his ſiſter's teſtimony.
That nobleman made next a pretence of hunting, and went to Suſſex, where
the woman at that time reſided: He found her both conſtant in her former
intelligence, and particular as to the facts; and the whole bore but too much
the face of probability. Mannoc and Derham, who were arreſted at the ſame
time, and examined by the chancellor, made the Queen's guilt entirely certain
by their confeſſion; and diſcovered other particulars, which redounded
ſtill more to her diſhonour. Three ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

them had even paſt the night in bed with her and her lovers. All the
examinations were laid before the King, who was ſo deeply affected, that he
remained a long time ſpeechleſs, and at laſt burſt into tears. The
Queen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now queſtioned, denied her guilt; but when informed, that a full
diſcovery was made, ſhe confeſſed, that ſhe had been criminal before
her marriage; and only inſiſted, that ſhe had never been falſe to the
King's bed. But as there was evidence, that one Colepeper had paſſed the
night with her alone ſince her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and as it appeared, that ſhe had
taken Derham, her old paramour, into her ſervice; ſhe ſeemed to deſerve

not ſo fully or expeditiouſly ſatiate his vengeance on all theſe
criminals as by aſſembling a Parliament, the uſual inſtrument of his
tyranny. The two houſes, having received the Queen's confeſſion, began by
an addreſs to the King; which conſiſted of ſeveral particulars. They
entreated him not to be vexed with this untoward accident, to which all men
were ſubject; but to conſider the frailty of human nature, and the
mutability of human affairs; and from theſe views to derive a ſubject of
conſolation. They deſired leave to frame a bill of attainder againſt the
Queen and her accomplices; and they begg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to give his aſſent to this
bill, not in perſon, which would renew his vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and might endanger his
health, but by commiſſioners appointed for that purpoſe. And as there was
a law in force, making it treaſon to ſpeak ill of the Queen, as well as

toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the counteſs of Bridgewater, and nine perſons more;
becauſe they knew the Queen's vicious life before her marriage, and yet
concealed it. This was an effect of Henry's uſual extravagance, to expect
that parents ſhould ſo far forget the ties of natural affection, and the
ſentiments of ſhame and decency, as to reveal to him the moſt ſecret
diſorders of their family. He himſelf ſeems to have been ſenſible of
the cruelty of this ſentence: For he pardoned the dutcheſs of Norfolk, and
moſt of the others, condemned for miſpriſion of treaſon.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, to ſecure himſelf for the future, as well as his
ſucceſſors, from this fatal accident, he engaged the Parliament to frame
a law, equally full of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance. It was enacted, that any one, who knew,
or vehemently preſumed any guilt in the Queen, and did not, within twenty
days, diſcloſe it to the King or council, ſhould be guilty of treaſon;
prohibiting every one, at the ſame time, from ſpreading the matter abroad,
or even privately whiſpering it to others. It was alſo enacted, that if the
King married any woman, who had been incontinent, taking her for a true maid,
ſhe ſhould be guilty of treaſon, in caſe ſhe did not previouſly
reveal her guilt to him. The people made merry with this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
clauſe, and ſaid, that the King muſt henceforth look out for a widow; for
no reputed maid would ever be perſwaded to incur the penalty of the
ſtatute<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. I. p. 314.</note>. After all
theſe laws were paſſed, the Queen was beheaded on Tower-hill, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the lady Rocheford. They behaved in a manner ſuitable to their
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute life; and as the lady Rocheford was known to be the chief
inſtrument, who had brought Anne Boleyn to her end, ſhe died unpitied; and
men were farther confirmed, by the diſcovery of this woman's guilt, in the
favourable ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents which they had entertained of that unfortunate
Queen.</p>
               <p>THE King made no demand of any ſubſidies from this
Parliament; but he found means of enriching his exchequer from another quarter:
He took far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſteps towards the diſſolution of colleges, hoſpitals,
and other foundations of that nature. The courtiers had been practiſing on
the preſidents and governors, to make a ſurrender of their revenues to the
King; and they had been ſucceſsful with eight of them. But there was an
obſtacle to their farther progreſs: It had been provided, by the local
ſtatutes of moſt of theſe foundations, that no preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, nor any
fellows, could make ſuch a deed without the unanimous vote of all the
fellows; and this conſent was not eaſily obtained. All ſuch ſtatutes
were now annulled by Parliament; and the revenues of theſe houſes, ſo
uſeful to the <pb n="249" facs="tcp:0429000101:254"/>

public, were now laid open to the rapacity of the King and his favourites<note n="*" place="bottom">It was enacted by this Parliament, that there ſhould be
trial of treaſon in any country where the King ſhould appoint by
commiſſion. The ſtatutes of treaſon had been extremely multiplied in
this reign; and ſuch an expedient ſaved trouble and charges in trying that
crime. The ſame Parliament erected Ireland into a kingdom; and Henry
henceforth annexed the title of King of Ireland to his other titles. This
ſeſſion, the commons firſt began the practice of freeing any of their
members, who were arreſted, by a writ iſſued by the ſpeaker. Formerly
it was uſual for them to apply for a writ from chancery to that purpoſe.
This precedent encreaſed the authority of the commons, and had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
conſiderable conſequences. Hollingſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

had been ſo long their prey, that nobody was ſurprized at any new inroads
made upon it. From the regular, Henry now proceeded to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtations on
the ſecular clergy. He extorted from many of the biſhops a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of
chapter lands; and by this deviſe he pillaged the ſees of Canterbury, York,
and London, and enriched his greedy paraſites and flatterers with their
ſpoils.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Eccleſiaſtical affairs.</note> THE clergy
have been commonly ſo fortunate as to make a concern for their temporal
intereſts go hand in hand with a jealouſy for orthodoxy; and both theſe
paſſions be regarded, by the people, ignorant and ſuperſtitious, as a
zeal for religion: But the violent and headſtrong character of Henry now
disjoined theſe objects. His rapacity was gratified by plundering the church;
his bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry and arrogance by perſecuting heretics. Tho' he engaged the
Parliament to mitigate the penalties of the ſix articles, ſo far as regards
the marriage of prieſts, which was now only ſubjected to a forfeiture of
goods, chattles, and lands during life; he was ſtill equally bent on
maintaining a rigid purity in ſpeculative principles. He had appointed a
commiſſion, conſiſting of the two archbiſhops and ſeveral biſhops
of both provinces, together with a conſiderable number of doctors of
divinity; and by virtue of his eccleſiaſtical ſupremacy he had given them
in charge to chooſe a religion for his people. Before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
had made any progreſs in this arduous undertaking, the Parliament, in 1541,
had paſſed a law, by which they ratified all the tenets, which theſe
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſhould eſtabliſh with the King's conſent: And they were not
aſhamed of expreſsly declaring that they took their religion upon truſt,
and had no other rule, in religious as well as temporal concerns, than the
arbitrary will of their maſter. There is only one clauſe of the ſtatute,
which may ſeem to ſavour ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the ſpirit of liberty: It was
enacted, that the eccleſiaſtical commiſſioners ſhould eſtabliſh
nothing repugnant to the laws and ſtatutes of the realm. But in reality this
proviſo was inſerted by the King, to ſerve his own purpoſes. By
introducing a confuſion and contradiction into the laws, he became more the 
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0429000101:255"/> maſter of every one's life and property. And as the
antient independance of the church ſtill gave him jealouſy, he was well
pleaſed, under cover of ſuch a clauſe, to introduce appeals from the
ſpiritual to the civil courts. It was for a like reaſon, he would never
promulgate a body of canon law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and encouraged the judges on all
occaſions to interpoſe in eccleſiaſtical cauſes wherever they thought
the law or royal prerogative concerned. A happy innovation; tho' at firſt
invented for arbitrary purpoſes!</p>
               <p>THE King, armed by the authority of Parliament, or rather by
their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legement of that ſpiritual ſupremacy, which he believed
inherent in him, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his commiſſioners to ſelect a ſyſtem of
tenets for the aſſent and belief of the nation. A ſmall volume was ſoon
after publiſhed, called, the <hi>Inſtitution of a Chriſtian Man,</hi>
which was received by the convocation, and voted to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
ſtandard of orthodoxy. All the delicate points of juſtification, faith,
free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, good works, and grace, are there defined, with a leaning towards the
opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the reformers: The ſacraments, which a few years before were only
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be three, are now encreaſed to the number of ſeven, conformable
to the ſentiments of the catholics. The King's caprice is diſcernible thro'
the whole; and the book is in reality to be regarded as his compoſition. For
Henry, while he made his opinion a rule for the nation, would tye his own hands
by no canon or authority, not even by any which he himſelf had formerly
eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>THE people had occaſion ſoon after to ſee a farther
inſtance of the King's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy. He was not long ſatisfied with his
Inſtitution of a Chriſtian Man: He ordered a new book to be compoſed,
called, the <hi>Erudition of a Chriſtian Man;</hi> and without aſking the
aſſent of the convocation, he publiſhed, by his own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and that
of the Parliament, this new model of orthodoxy. It differs from the
inſtitution<note n="*" place="bottom">Collier, vol. ii. p. 190.</note>; but the
King was no leſs poſitive in his new creed than he had been in the old; and
he required the belief of the nation to veer about at his ſignal. In both
theſe books, he was particularly careful to inculcate the doctrine of
paſſive obedience; and he was no leſs careful to retain the nation in the
practice.</p>
               <p>WHILE the King was ſpreading his own books among the people,
he ſeems to have been extremely perplexed, as well as the clergy, what
courſe to take with the ſcriptures. A review had been made by the
eccleſiaſtical ſynod of the new tranſlation of the Bible; and Gardiner
had propoſed, that, inſtead of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying Engliſh expreſſions
throughout, ſeveral Latin words ſhould ſtill be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, becauſe
they contained, as he pretended, ſuch peculiar energy and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficance,
that they had no correſpondent terms in the vulgar tongue<note n="†" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. i. p. 315.</note>. Among theſe were <hi>ecleſia,
paenitentia, pontifex, contritus, holocauſta, ſacramentum, elementa,</hi> 
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:0429000101:256"/> 
                  <hi>ceremonia, muſterium, preſbyter, ſacrificium,
humilitas, ſatisfactio, peccatum, gratia, hoſtia, charitas,</hi> &amp;c.
But as this mixture would have appeared extremely bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, and was plainly
calculated for no other purpoſe than to retain the people in their antient
ignorance, the propoſal was rejected. The knowledge of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, however,
at leaſt their diſputative turn, ſeemed to be an inconvenience ſtill
more dangerous; and the King and Parliament<note n="‡" place="bottom">Which met on the 22d of January, 1543.</note>, ſoon after the
publication of the ſcriptures, retracted the conceſſion, which they had
formerly made; and prohibited all but gentlemen and merchants to peruſe
them<note n="‖" place="bottom">33 Hen. VIII. c. 1.</note>. Even that
liberty was not granted, without an apparent heſitation, and a dread of the
conſequences: Theſe perſons were allowed to read, <hi>ſo it be done
quietly and with good order.</hi> And the preamble to the act ſets forth, 
<q rend="inline">"that many ſeditious and ignorant perſons
had abuſed the liberty granted them for reading the Bible, and that great
diverſity of opinions, animoſities, tumults, and ſchiſms had been
occaſioned by perverting the ſenſe of the ſcriptures."</q> It ſeemed
very difficult to reconcile the King's model for uniformity, with the
permiſſion of free enquiry.</p>
               <p>THE maſs book alſo paſſed under the King's cognizance;
and little alteration was as yet made in it: Some doubtful or fictitious
ſaints only were ſtruck out; and the name of the pope was erazed. This
latter precaution was likewiſe uſed with regard to every new book, that was
printed, or even old book that was ſold. The word, Pope, was carefully
omitted or blotted out<note n="§" place="bottom">Parliamentary Hiſtory,
vol. iii. p. 113.</note>; as if that precaution could aboliſh the term from
the language, or as if ſuch a perſecution of it did not rather imprint it
more ſtrongly in the memory of the people.</p>
               <p>THE King took care about this time to clear the churches of
another abuſe, which had crept into them. Plays, interludes, and farces were
there often acted in deriſion of the former ſuperſtitions; and the
reverence of the multitude for their antient principles and modes of worſhip,
was thereby gradually effaced<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. i. p.
318.</note>. We do not hear, that the catholics attempted to retaliate by
employing this powerful engine againſt their adverſaries, or endeavoured by
like arts to expoſe that fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſpirit, by which, it appears, the
reformers were often actuated. Perhaps the people were not diſpoſed to
reliſh a jeſt on that ſide: Perhaps the greater ſimplicity and the more
ſpiritual abſtract worſhip of the proteſtants, gave leſs hold to
ridicule, which is commonly founded on ſenſible repreſentations. It was,
therefore, a very agreeable conceſſion, which Henry made the catholic
party, to ſuppreſs entirely theſe religious comedies.</p>
               <p>THUS Henry laboured inceſſantly, by arguments, creeds, and
penal ſtatutes, to bring his ſubjects to an uniformity in their religious
ſentiments: But as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0429000101:257"/> himſelf, with the
greateſt earneſtneſs, into all theſe ſcholaſtic reaſonings, he
encouraged the people, by his example, to apply themſelves to the ſtudy of
theology; and it was in vain afterwards to expect, however preſent fear might
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain their tongues or pens, that they would cordially agree in any ſet
of tenets or opinions preſcribed to them.</p>

determined to avenge himſelf of the King of Scots for flighting the advances,
which he made for his friendſhip, would gladly have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a ſupply from
the Parliament, to enable him to proſecute that enterprize; but as he did not
think it prudent to diſcover his intentions, the Parliament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to
their frugal maxims, would underſtand no hints; and the King was
diſappointed in his expectations. He continued, however, to make preparations
for war; and ſo ſoon as he thought himſelf in a condition to invade
Scotland, he publiſhed a manifeſto, by which he endeavoured to juſtify
his hoſtilities. He complained of James's diſappointing him in the
promiſed interview; which was the real ground of the quarrel<note n="*" place="bottom">Buchanan, lib. 14. Drummond in James the fifth.</note>: But
in order to give a more ſpecious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring to the enterprize, he mentioned
other injuries; that his nephew had given protection to ſome Engliſh rebels
and fugitives, and had detained ſome territory, which, Henry pretended,
belonged to England. He even revived the old claim of the dependance of the
crown of Scotland, and he ſummoned James to do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to him as his liege
lord and ſuperior. He employed the duke of Norfolk, whom he called the
ſcourage of the Scots, to command in the war; and tho' James ſent the
biſhop of Aberdeen, and Sir James Learmont of Darſay, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe his
uncle, he would hearken to no terms of accommodation. While Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk was
aſſembling his army at Newcaſtle, Sir Robert Bowes, attended with 
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0429000101:258"/> Sir Ralph Sadler, Sir Ralph Evers, Sir Brian Latoun, and
others, made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion into Scotland, and advanced towards Jedburgh, with
an intention of pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laging and deſtroying that town. The earl of Angus, and
George Douglas, his brother, who had been ſo many years baniſhed their
country, and had ſubſiſted by Henry's bounty, joined the Engliſh army
in this incurſion; and the forces, commanded by Bowes, exceeded four
thouſand men. James had not been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent in his preparations for defence,
and had poſted a conſiderable body, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of the earl of
Huntley, for the protection of the borders. Lord Hume, at the head of his
clients, was haſtening to join Huntley, when he met with the Engliſh army;
and a battle immediately enſued. 
<note place="margin">24th Auguſt.</note> While they were engaged,
the forces under Huntley began to appear; and the Engliſh, afraid of being
overpowered and ſurrounded, took to flight, and were purſued by the enemy.
Evers, Latoun, and ſome other perſons of diſtinction, were taken
pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. A few only of ſmall note fell in this ſkirmiſh<note n="*" place="bottom">Buchanan, lib. 14.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE duke of Norfolk, mean while, began to move from his camp at
New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle; and being attended by the earls of Shrewſbury, Derby,
Cumberland, Surrey, Hertford, Rutland, with many others of the nobility, he
advanced to the borders. His army amounted to above twenty thouſand men; and
it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the utmoſt efforts of Scotland to reſiſt ſuch formidable
preparations. James had aſſembled his whole military force at Fala and
Sautrey, and was ready to advance ſo ſoon as he ſhould be informed of
Norfolk's invading his kingdom. The Engliſh paſſed the Tweed at Berwic,
and advanced along the banks of the river as far as Kelſo; but hearing that
James had gathered together near thirty thouſand men, they repaſſed the
river at that village, and retreated into their own country<note n="†" place="bottom">Buchanan, lib. 14.</note>. The King of Scots, inflamed with a
deſire of military glory, and of revenge on his invaders, gave the ſignal
for purſuing them, and carrying the war into England. He was ſurprized to
find, that his nobility, who were generally diſaffected on account of the
preference, which he had given the clergy, oppoſed this reſolution, and
refuſed to attend him in his projected enterprize. Enraged at this defection,
he reproached them with cowardice, and threatened vengeance; but ſtill
reſolved, with the forces which adhered to him, to make an impreſſion on
the enemy's country. He ſent ten thouſand men to the weſtern borders, who
entered England at Solway firth; and he himſelf followed them at a ſmall
diſtance, ready to join them upon occaſion. Diſguſted, however, with
the refractory diſpoſition of his nobles, he ſent a meſſenger to the
army, depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lord Maxwel, their general, of his commiſſion, and
conferring the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand on Oliver Sinclair, a private gentleman, who was his
favourite. The <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0429000101:259"/> army were extremely diſpleaſed with
this alteration, and were ready to diſband; 
<note place="margin">24 November. Victory at Solway.</note> when a
ſmall body of Engliſh appeared, not exceeding 500 men, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Dacres and Muſgrave. A panic ſeized the Scotch, who immediately took to
flight, and were purſued by the enemy. Few were killed in this rout; for it
was no action; but a great many were taken priſoners, and ſome of the
prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal nobility. Among theſe were the earls of Caſſilis and
Glencairn; the lords Maxwel, Fleming, Sommerville, Oliphant, Grey, who were all
ſent to London, and given in cuſtody to different noblemen.</p>
               <p>THE King of Scots, hearing of this diſaſter, was confounded
to the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; and being naturally of a melancholy diſpoſition, as
well as endowed with a high ſpirit, he loſt all command of his temper on
this diſmal occaſion. Rage againſt his nobility, who, he believed, had
betrayed him; ſhame for a defeat by ſuch unequal numbers; regret of the
paſt, fear of the future; all theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo wrought upon him,
that he would admit of no conſolation, but aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned himſelf wholly to
deſpair. His body was waſted by ſympathy with his anxious mind; and even
his life began to be thought in danger. He had no child living; and hearing
that his Queen was ſafely delivered, he aſked whether ſhe had brought him
a male or female? Being told, the latter; he turned about in his bed: 
<q rend="inline">"The crown came with a woman," ſaid he, "and

princes were carried, proceeded entirely from the ſituation of affairs,
during that age, which rendered it impoſſible for them to act with greater
temper or moderation, after they had embraced the reſolution of ſupporting

Beaton's forgery, with the acceſſion of the noblemen, who had been
priſoners in England, aſſiſted too by ſome money, ſent from London,
was able to turn the ballance in his favour. The earl of Angus, and his
brother, having taken the preſent opportunity of returning into their own
country, oppoſed the cardinal with all the force of that powerful family; and
the majority of the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had now embraced oppoſite intereſts to
thoſe which formerly prevailed. Arran was declared governor; the cardinal was
committed to cuſtody under the care of lord Seton; and a negotiation was
commenced with Sir Ralph Sadler, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ambaſſador, for the
marriage of the infant Queen with the Prince of Wales. 
<note place="margin">Treaty with Scotland.</note> The following
conditions were quickly agreed on; that the Queen ſhould remain in Scotland
till ſhe was ten years of age; that ſhe ſhould then be ſent to England
to be educated; that three Scotch nobles ſhould immediately be delivered as
hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to Henry; and that the kingdom, notwithſtanding its union with
Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſhould ſtill preſerve its laws and privileges<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir Ralph Sadler's Letters.</note>. By means of theſe equitable
conditions, the war between the nations, which had threatened Scotland with
ſuch diſmal calamities, ſeemed to be fully compoſed, and to be changed
into perpetual concord and unanimity.</p>
               <p>BUT the cardinal-primate, having prevailed on Seton to reſtore
him to his liberty, was able, by his intrigues, to confound all theſe
meaſures, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be ſo well concerted. He aſſembled the
moſt conſiderable eccleſiaſtics; and having repreſented to them the
imminent danger, to which their revenues and privileges were expoſed, he
perſwaded them to collect privately from the clergy a large ſum of money,
by which, if entruſted to his management, he promiſed to overturn the
ſchemes of their enemies<note n="†" place="bottom">Buchanan, lib.
15.</note>. Beſides the partizans, whom he acquired by pecuniary motives, he
rouzed up the zeal of thoſe, who were attached to the catholic worſhip; and
he repreſented the union with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land as the ſure forerunner of ruin to
the church and the antient religion. The national antipathy of the Scotch
againſt the Engliſh nation, was alſo an infallible engine, by which the
cardinal wrought upon the people; and tho' the terror of Henry's arms, and
their inability to make reſiſtance, had procured a temporary aſſent to
the alliance and marriage propoſed, the ſettled habits of the nation
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced an extreme averſion to thoſe meaſures. The Engliſh
ambaſſador and his train received many inſults from perſons whom the
cardinal had incited to commit thoſe indignities, in hopes of bringing on a
rupture. But Sadler very prudently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0429000101:262"/> the
matter, and waited patiently till the day appointed for the delivery of the
hoſtages. He then demanded of the regent the performance of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
article; but received for anſwer, that his authority was very precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that the nation had now taken a different impreſſion, and that it was not
in his power to compel any of the nobility to deliver themſelves as
hoſtages to the Engliſh. Sadler, foreſeeing the conſequence of this
refuſal, ſent a ſummons to all thoſe who had been priſoners in
England, and required them to fulfil the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which they had given of
returning into cuſtody. None of them ſhowed ſo much ſentiment of
honour, as to perform their engagements, except Gilbert Kennedy, earl of
Caſſilis. Henry was ſo well pleaſed with the behaviour of this
nobleman, that he not only received him graciouſly, but honoured him with
preſents, gave him his liberty, and ſent him back to Scotland, with his two
brothers, whom he had left as hoſtages<note n="*" place="bottom">Buchanan, lib.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">New rupture.</note> THIS behaviour of the
Scotch nobles, tho' it reflected diſhonour on the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was not
unacceptable to the cardinal, who foreſaw, that all theſe perſons would
now be deeply intereſted to maintain their enmity and oppoſition to the
Engliſh. And as a war was ſoon expected with that kingdom, he found it
neceſſary immediately to apply to France, and to crave the aſſiſtance
of that ancient ally, during the preſent diſtreſſes of the Scotch
nation. Tho' Francis was fully ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his intereſt in ſupporting
Scotland, a demand of aid could not have been made on him at a more
unſeaſonable juncture. His pretenſions on the Milaneſe, and his
reſentment againſt Charles, had engaged him in a war with that potentate;
and having made very great, tho' fruit'eſs efforts during the preceding
campaign, he was the more diſabled at preſent from defending his own
dominions, much more from granting any ſuccour to the Scotch. Mathew Stuart,
earl of Lenox, a young nobleman of a great family, was at that time in the
French court; and Francis, being informed, that he was engaged in ancient and
hereditary enmity with the Hamiltons, who had murdered his father, ſent him
over to his native country, as a ſupport to the cardinal and the Queen
mother: And he promiſed, that a ſupply of money, and, if neceſſary,
even military ſuccours, ſhould ſoon be diſpatched after him. Arran, the
governor, ſeeing all theſe preparations againſt him, aſſembled his
friends, and made an attempt to get the perſon of the infant Queen into his
cuſtody; but being repulſed, he was obliged to come to an accommodation
with his enemies, and to entruſt that precious charge to four neutral
perſons, the heads of potent families, the Grahams, Areſkines, Lindſeys,
and Leviſtons. The arrival of Lenox, in the midſt of theſe
tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0429000101:263"/> ſerved to render the victory of the
French party over the Engliſh ſtill more undiſputable<note n="‡" place="bottom">Buchanan, lib. XV. Drummond.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Rupture with France.</note> THE oppoſition
which Henry met with in Scotland from the French intrigues, excited his
reſentment, and farther confirmed the reſolution which he had before taken,
of breaking with France, and of uniting his arms with thoſe of the emperor.
He had other grounds of complaint againſt the French King; which, tho' they
were not of great importance, yet being recent, were able to overballance
thoſe great injuries which he had formerly received from Charles. He
pretended, that Francis had engaged to imitate his example in ſeparating
himſelf entirely from the ſee of Rome, and that he had broke his promiſe
in that particular. He was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, that James, his nephew, had been
allowed to marry, firſt Magdalene of France, then a princeſs of the houſe
of Guiſe; and he conſidered theſe alliances as pledges which Francis gave
of his intentions to ſupport the Scotch againſt the power of England<note n="*" place="bottom">Pere Daniel.</note>. He had been informed of ſome railleries,
which the French King had thrown out againſt his conduct with regard to his
wives. He was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted, that Francis, after ſo many obligations which
he owed him, had ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed him to the emperor; and, in the confidence of
friendſhip, had raſhly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his ſecrets to that ſubtle and
intereſted monarch. And he complained, that regular payments were never made
of the ſums due to him by France, and of the penſion which had been
promiſed. Impelled by all theſe motives, he alienated himſelf from his
ancient friend and confederate, and formed a league with the emperor, who very
earneſtly courted his alliance. This league, beſides ſtipulations for
mutual defence, contained a plan for invading France; and the two monarchs
agreed to enter Francis's dominions with an army, each of twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five
thouſand men; and to require that prince to pay Henry all the ſums which he
owed him, and to conſign Boulogne, Montreuil, Terouenne, and Ardres, as a
ſecurity for the regular payment of his penſion for the future: In caſe
theſe conditions were rejected, the confederate princes agreed, to challenge,
for Henry, the crown of France, and the dutchies of Normandy, Aquitaine, and
Guienne; for Charles, the dutchy of Burgundy, and ſome other territories<note n="†" place="bottom">Rymer, XIV. p. 768. XV. 2.</note>. That they might
have a pretence for enforcing theſe claims, they ſent a meſſage to
Francis, requiring him to renounce his alliance with Sultan Solyman, and to
make repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for all the prejudice which Chriſtendom had ſuffered from
that unnatural confederacy. Upon the French King's refuſal, war was declared
againſt him by the confederates. It may be proper to obſerve, that the
partizans of France object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Charles his alliance with the heretical King
of England, as no leſs odious <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0429000101:264"/> than that which Francis
had contracted with Solyman: And they obſerved, that this league was a breach
of that ſolemn promiſe which he had given to Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſeventh, never
to make peace or alliance with England.</p>

                  <note place="margin">22 January.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">A Parliament.</note> WHILE the treaty with the
emperor was negociating, the King ſummoned a new ſeſſion of Parliament,
in order to obtain ſupplies for his projected war with France. The Parliament
granted him a ſubſidy to be paid in three years: It was levied in a
peculiar manner; but exceeded not three ſhillings in the pound upon any
individual<note n="‡" place="bottom">They who were worth in goods twenty
ſhillings and upwards to five pounds, paid four pence of every pound; from
five pounds to ten pounds, eight pence; from ten pounds to twenty pounds,
ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pence; from twenty and upwards, two ſhillings. Lands, fees, and
annuities, paid eight pence in the pound from twenty ſhillings to five
pounds; from five pounds to ten pounds, ſixteen pence; from ten pounds to
twenty pounds, two ſhillings; from twenty pounds and upwards, three
ſhillings.</note>. The convocation gave the King ſix ſhillings in the
pound, to be levied in three years. Greater ſums were always, even during the
eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the catholic religion, exacted from the clergy than the
laity: Which made the emperor Charles ſay, when Henry diſſolved the
monaſteries, and ſold their revenues, or beſtowed them on his nobility
and courtiers, that he had killed the hen which brought him the golden
eggs<note n="*" place="bottom">Collier, vol. II. p. 176.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE Parliament alſo facilitated the execution of the former
law, by which the King's proclamations were made equal to ſtatutes: They
appointed, that any nine counſellors ſhould form a legal court for
puniſhing all diſobedience to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations. The total abolition of juries
in criminal cauſes, as well as of all Parliaments, ſeemed, if the King had
ſo pleaſed, the neceſſary conſequence of this enormous law. He might
iſſue proclamations, for the execution of any penal ſtatutes, and
afterwards try the criminals, not for breach of the law, but for diſobedience
to his proclamation. It is remarkable, that the lord Mountjoy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a
proteſt againſt this ſtatute; and it is equally remarkable, that that
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt is the only one which was entered againſt any public bill during
this whole reign<note n="†" place="bottom">Burnet, p. 322.</note>.</p>
               <p>WE have taken notice, in the end of the former chapter, of
ſome laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding religion, which the Parliament paſſed this
ſeſſion, in order to gratify the King's humour. It was farther
enacted<note n="‖" place="bottom">34 &amp; 35 Hen. VIII. c. 1</note>, that
every ſpiritual perſon, who preached or taught contrary to the doctrine
contained in the King's book, the <hi>Erudition of a chriſtian man,</hi> or

admitted on the firſt conviction to renounce his errors; on the ſecond, he
was required to carry a faggot; which if he refuſed to do, or fell into a

that the act of the ſix articles was ſtill in force. But in order to make
the King more entirely maſter of his people, it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, that he might
hereafter, at his pleaſure, change this act, or any proviſion in it. By
this clauſe, both parties were retained in ſubjection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo far as
regarded religion, the King was inveſted, in the fulleſt manner, with the
ſole legiſlative autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in his kingdom; and all his ſubjects were,

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">12th July.</note> THE reformers began to
entertain hopes, that this exorbitant power would be employed in their favour.
The King married Catherine Par, widow to Nevil lord Latimer; a woman of virtue,
and ſomewhat inclined to the new doctrine. By this marriage, Henry made good
what had formerly been foretold in jeſt, that he would be obliged to
eſpouſe a widow. The King's league with the emperor, ſeemed to be a
circumſtance no leſs favourable to the catholic party; and thus matters
remained ſtill nearly ballanced between the factions.</p>
               <p>THE advantages gained by this powerful confederacy between Henry
and Charles, were very inconſiderable, during the preſent year. The
campaign was opened with a victory, gained by the duke of Cleves, Francis's
ally, over the forces of the emperor<note n="‖" place="bottom">Memoires du
Bellay, lib. X.</note>: Francis, in perſon, took the field early; and made
himſelf maſter, without reſiſtance, of the whole dutchy of Luxembourg:
He afterwards took Landrecy, and added ſome fortifications to it. Charles,
having at laſt aſſembled a powerful army, appeared in the Low Countries;
and after taking almoſt every fortreſs in the dutchy of Cleves, he reduced
the duke to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the terms which he was pleaſed to preſcribe to
him. Being then joined by a body of ſix thouſand Engliſh, he ſat down
before Landrecy, and covered the ſiege with an army of above forty thouſand
men. Francis advanced at the head of an army not much inferior; as if he
intended to give the emperor battle, or oblige him to abandon the ſiege: But
while theſe two rival monarchs were facing each other, and all the world
ſtood in expectation of ſome great event; the French found means to throw
ſuccours into Landrecy, and having thus ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected their purpoſe, they
ſkilfully made a retreat. Charles, finding the ſeaſon far advanced,
deſpaired of ſucceſs in his enterprize, and found it neceſſary to
raiſe the ſiege.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0429000101:266"/> 
                  <note place="margin">Affairs of Scotland.</note> THE vanity of
Henry was flattered, by the figure which he made in the great tranſactions on
the continent: But the intereſts of his kingdom were much more deeply
concerned in the event of affairs in Scotland. Arran, the governor, was of ſo
indolent and unambitious a character, that had he not been ſtimulated by his
friends and dependants, he never had aſpired to any ſhare in the
adminiſtration; and when he found himſelf overpowered by the party of the
Queen dowager, the cardinal, and the earl of Lenox, he was glad to accept of
any terms of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, however diſhonourable. He even gave them a
ſure pledge of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, by renouncing the principles of the
reformers, and reconciling himſelf to the Romiſh communion in the
Franciſcan church at Stirling. By this weakneſs and levity he loſt his
credit with the whole nation, and rendered the proteſtants, who were hitherto
the chief ſupport of his power, his moſt mortal enemies. The cardinal
acquired the entire aſcendant in the kingdom: The Queen dowager put implicit
confidence in him: The governor was obliged to yield to him in every
pretenſion: Lenox alone was become an obſtacle to his meaſures, and
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to ſome difficulty.</p>
               <p>THE inveterate enmity which had taken place between the families
of Lenox and Arran, made the intereſts of theſe two noblemen entirely
incompatible; and as the cardinal and the French party, in order to engage
Lenox the more in their cauſe, had flattered him with the hopes of
ſucceeding to the crown after their infant ſovereign, this rivalſhip had
tended ſtill farther to rouze the animoſity of the Hamiltons. Lenox too had
been encouraged to aſpire to the marriage of the Queen dowager, which would
have given him ſome pretenſions to the regency; and as he was become
aſſuming, on account of the ſervices which he had render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the party,
the cardinal found, that, ſince he muſt chooſe between the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of Lenox and Arran, the latter nobleman, who was more eaſily governed, and
who was inveſted with preſent authority, was in every reſpect preferable.
In order to remove the former, after the eaſieſt and leaſt obnoxious
manner, he wrote to Francis, with whom he had entire credit, by means of the
duke of Guiſe, father to the Queen dowager; and after praiſing Lenox for
his paſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, he repreſented the preſent difficulties and
obſtructions, which he occaſioned in the adminiſtration, and deſired
that he might be recalled to France, where he enjoyed great credit and large
poſſeſſions. But the impatience of Lenox to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his purpoſes,
allowed not this political artifice leiſure to operate. Finding that he was
not likely to ſucceed in his pretenſions to the Queen dowager, and that
Arran prevailed in every conteſt, he retired to Dunbarton, the governor of
which was entirely in his intereſts; he entered into a ſecret negociation
with the <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0429000101:267"/> Engliſh court; and he ſummoned his clients
and par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

thoſe who were inclined to the proteſtant religion, or were on any account
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with the cardinal's adminiſtration, now regarded Lenox as the
head of their party, and they readily made him a tender of their ſervices. In
a little time, he had collected an army of ten thouſand men, and he threatned
his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with immediate deſtruction. The cardinal had no equal force to
oppoſe to him; but as he was a prudent man, he foreſaw that Lenox could not
long ſubſiſt ſo great an army, and he endeavoured to protract time, by
opening a negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him. He ſeduced his followers, by various
artifices; he engaged the Douglaſſes in his intereſts; he repreſented
to the whole nation the danger of civil wars and commotions. And Lenox, finding
himſelf engaged in an unequal conteſt, was at laſt obliged to lay down
his arms, and to accept of terms of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation with the governor and the
cardinal. Preſent peace was reſtored; but no confidence took place between
the parties. Lenox, fortifying his caſtles, and putting himſelf in a
poſture of defence, waited the ſuccours of the Engliſh, from whoſe
aſſiſtance alone he expected to obtain the ſuperiority over his
ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>

reſtrained Henry from military operations, he ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned a new Parliament;
where a law was paſſed, ſuch as he was pleaſed to dictate, with regard

Wales, or any of the King's male iſſue, were firſt and immediate heirs to

Elizabeth, to their right of ſucceſſion. This ſeemed a reaſonable
piece of juſtice, and corrected what the King's former violence had thrown
into confuſion; but it was impoſſible for Henry to do any thing, however
laudable, without betraying, in ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, his uſual caprice
and extravagance: Tho' he opened the way for theſe two princeſſes to
mount the throne, he would not allow the act to be reverſed which had
declared them both illegitimate; he made the Parliament con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

them, if they refuſed to ſubmit to any conditions which he ſhould be
pleaſed to impoſe; and he required them to enact, that, in default of his
own iſſue, he might diſpoſe of the crown, as he pleaſed, by will or
letters patent. He did not probably foreſee, that in proportion as he
degraded the Parliament, by rendering them the paſſive inſtrument of his
variable and violent inclinations, he taught the people to regard all their
acts as invalid, and thereby defeated even the purpoſes which he was ſo
bent to attain.</p>
               <p>AN act was paſſed, that the King's uſual ſtile ſhould
be 
<q rend="inline">"King of England, France, and Ireland, defender
of the faith, and on earth the ſupreme head <pb n="263" facs="tcp:0429000101:268"/> of the

to retain the title of defender of the faith, which the ſee of Rome had
conferred on him for maintaining its cauſe againſt Luther; and yet
ſubjoin his eccleſiaſtical ſupremacy, in oppoſition to the claims of
that ſee.</p>
               <p>AN act was alſo paſſed, for the remiſſion of a loan of
money, which the King had lately raiſed. It will eaſily be believed, that,
after the former act of this kind, the loan was not entirely voluntary<note n="*" place="bottom">35 Hen. VIII. c. 12.</note>. But there was a peculiar
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance attending the preſent ſtatute, which none but Henry would
have thought of: That thoſe who had already got payment, either in whole or
in part, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fund the ſums to the exchequer.</p>
               <p>THE oaths which Henry eſtabliſhed for the ſecurity of his
eccleſiaſtical model, were not more reaſonable than his other meaſures.
All his ſubjects of any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction had already been obliged to renounce
the pope's ſupremacy; but as the clauſes which they ſwore to, had not
been eſteemed entirely ſatisfactory, another oath was impoſed, and it was
added, that all thoſe who had taken the former oaths, ſhould be
underſtood to have taken the new one<note n="†" place="bottom">35 Hen.

by an oath which they had never conſented to take.</p>
               <p>THE moſt commendable act to which the Parliament gave their
ſanction, was that by which they mitigated the law of the ſix articles, and
ordained, that no perſon ſhould be put to his trial upon any accuſation
concerning any of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences comprized in that ſanguinary ſtatute,
except on the oath of twelve per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before commiſſioners authorized for
that purpoſe; and that no perſon ſhould be arreſted or committed to
ward for any ſuch offence before he was indicted. Any preacher, accuſed of
ſpeaking in his ſermon contrary to theſe articles, muſt be indicted
within forty days.</p>
               <p>THE King always experienced the limits of his exorbitant
authority whenever he demanded ſubſidies, however moderate, from the
Parliament; and, therefore, not to hazard a refuſal, he made no mention this
ſeſſion of a ſupply: But as his wars both with France and Scotland, as
well as his uſual prodigality, had involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in great expence, he had
recourſe to other methods of filling his treaſury: Notwithſtanding the

And he enhanced gold from forty-five ſhillings to forty-eight an ounce; and
ſilver from three ſhillings and nine pence to four ſhillings. His

the perſon and property of every individual.</p>
               <p>EARLY this year the King ſent a fleet and army to invade
Scotland. The fleet conſiſted of near two hundred veſſels, and carried
on board ten thouſand men. Dudley lord Liſle commanded the ſea forces;
the earl of Hertford the land. The troops were diſembarked near Leith; and
after diſſipating a ſmall body which oppoſed them, they took that town
without reſiſtance, and then marched to Edinburgh. The gates were ſoon
beat down (for little or no reſiſtance was made); and the Engliſh firſt
pillaged, and then ſet fire to the city. The regent and cardinal were not
prepared to oppoſe ſo great a force, and they fled to Stirling. 
<note place="margin">18th May.</note> Hertford marched eaſtward;
and being joined by a new body under Evers, warden of the eaſt marches, he
laid waſte the whole country, burned and deſtroyed Hadington and Dunbar,
and then retired into England; having loſt only forty men in the whole
expedition. The earl of Arran collected ſome forces; but finding that the
Engliſh were already departed, he turned them againſt Lenox, who was
juſtly ſuſpected of a correſpondence with the enemy. That nobleman,
after making ſome reſiſtance, was obliged to fly into England; where
Henry ſettled a penſion on him, and even gave him his niece, the lady
Margaret Douglas, in marriage. In return, Lenox ſtipulated conditions, by
which, had he been able to execute them, he muſt have reduced his country to
a total ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude<note n="†" place="bottom">Rymer, XV. 23,

               <p>HENRY'S policy was blamed in this ſudden and violent
incurſion; by which he inflamed the paſſion of the Scotch, without

have involved the ſubjection of England. Theſe two princes had agreed to
invade France with forces amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to above a hundred thouſand men: Henry
engaged to ſet out from Calais; Charles from the Low Countries: They were to
enter on no ſiege, but leaving all the frontier towns behind them, to march
directly to Paris, where they were to join their forces, and thence to proceed
to the entire conqueſt of the kingdom. Francis could not oppoſe to theſe
formidable preparations, much above forty thouſand men.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">14th July. Campaign in France.</note> HENRY,
having appointed the Queen regent during his abſence, paſſed over to
Calais with thirty thouſand men, accompanied with the dukes of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk and
Suffolk, Fitzalan earl of Arundel, Vere earl of Oxford, the earl of Surrey,
Paulet lord St. John, lord Ferrers of Chartley, lord Mountjoy, lord Grey of
Wilton, Sir Anthony Brown, Sir Francis Bryan, and the moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nobility and gentry of his kingdom. The Engliſh army was ſoon joined by the
count de Buren, admiral of Flanders, with ten thouſand foot, and four
thouſand horſe; and the whole compoſed an army, which nothing on that
frontier was able to reſiſt. The chief force of the French army was drawn
to the ſide of Champagne, in order to oppoſe the imperialiſts.</p>
               <p>THE emperor, with an army of near ſixty thouſand men, had
taken the field much earlier than Henry; and not to loſe time, while he
waited for the march of his confederate, he ſat down before Luxembourg, which
he took: He thence proceeded to Commercy on the Meuſe, which was
ſurrendered to him: Ligny met with the ſame fate: He next laid ſiege to
St. Diſier on the Marne, which, tho' a weak place, made a brave
reſiſtance, under the count of Sancerre the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and the ſiege was
protracted beyond expectation.</p>
               <p>THE emperor was employed before this town at the time the
Engliſh forces were aſſembled in Picardy. Henry, either tempted by the
defenceleſs condition of the French frontiers, or thinking that the emperor
had firſt broke engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by forming ſieges, or, perhaps, foreſeeing
the dangerous conſequences of deſtroying entirely the French power,
inſtead of marching forward to Paris, ſat down before Montreuil and
Boulog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

commanded the army before Montreuil: The King himſelf that before Boulogne.
Vervin was governor of Boulogne, and under him Philip Corſe, a brave old
ſoldier, who encouraged the garriſon to defend themſelves to the laſt
extremity againſt the Engliſh.

Henry by the cowardice of Vervin; who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards beheaded for this
diſhonourable capitulation.</p>
               <p>DURING the courſe of this ſiege, Charles had taken St.
Diſier; and finding the ſeaſon much advanced, he began to hearken to a
treaty of peace with France, ſince all his ſchemes for ſubduing that
kingdom were likely to prove abortive. In order to have a pretence for
deſerting his ally, he ſent a meſſenger to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh camp,
requiring Henry immediately to fulfil his engagements, and to meet him with his
army before Paris. Henry replied, that he was too far engaged in the ſiege of
Boulogne to raiſe it with honour, and that the emperor himſelf had firſt
broke the concert by forming ſieges. 
<note place="margin">18th Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> This anſwer ſerved
Charles as a ſufficient reaſon for concluding a peace with Francis at
Crepy, where no mention was made of the Engliſh. He ſtipulated to give
Flanders as a dowry to his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whom he agreed to marry to the duke of
Orleans, Francis's ſecond ſon; and Francis, in return, withdrew his troops
from Piemont and Savoy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all claim to Milan, Naples, and other
territories in Italy. This peace, ſo advantageous to Francis, was procured
partly by the deciſive victory obtained in the beginning of the campaign by
the count of Anguyen over the imperialiſts at Ceriſolles in Piemont, partly
by the emperor's great deſire to turn his arms againſt the proteſtant
princes in Germany. Charles ordered his troops to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the
Engliſh in Picardy; 
<note place="margin">30th Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> and Henry, finding
himſelf obliged to raiſe the ſiege of Montreuil, returned into England.
This campaign ſerved, to the populace, as matter of great triumph; but all
men of ſenſe concluded, that the King had, as in all his former military
enterprizes, made, at an infinite charge, an acquiſition which was of no
manner of conſequence.</p>
               <p>THE war with Scotland, meanwhile, was conducted feebly, and with
various ſucceſs. Sir Ralph Evers, now lord Evers, and Sir Bryan Latoun,
made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road into that kingdom; and having laid waſte the counties of
Tiviotdale and the Merſe, they proceeded to the abbey of Coldingham, which
they took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of, and fortified. The regent aſſembled an
army of eight thouſand men, in order to diſlodge them from this poſt; but
he had no ſooner opened his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries before the place, than a ſudden
panic ſeized him, and he fled to Dunbar. He complained of the mutinies of his
army, and pretended to be afraid leſt they ſhould deliver him into the
hands of the Engliſh: But his own unwarlike ſpirit was generally believed
to have been the motive of this diſhonourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. The Scotch army, upon
the departure of their general, immediately fell into confuſion; and had not
Angus, with a few of his retainers, brought off the cannon, and protected their
rear, the Engliſh might have gained great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages over them. Evers,
elated with this ſucceſs, boaſted to Henry, that he <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0429000101:272"/> had conquered all Scotland to the Forth; and he claimed a reward for
this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſervice. The duke of Norfolk, who knew with what difficulty
ſuch acquiſitions would be maintained againſt a warlike people, adviſed
the King to grant him, as his reward, the conqueſts of which he ſo highly
boaſted. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1545</label> The next inroad made by the
Engliſh, ſhewed the vanity of Evers's hopes. This gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral led about five
thouſand men into Tiviotdale, and was employed in ravaging that country; when
intelligence was brought him, that ſome Scotch forces ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared near the
abbey of Melroſs. Angus had excited the regent to more acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; and a
proclamation being iſſued for aſſembling the troops of the neighbouring
counties, a conſiderable body had repaired to his ſtandard. Norman Leſly,
ſon to the Earl of Rothes, had alſo joined the army with ſome volunteers
from Fife; and he inſpired courage into the whole, as well by this
acceſſion of force, as by his perſonal bravery and intrepidity. In order
to bring their troops to the neceſſity of a ſteddy defence, the Scotch
leaders ordered all their cavalry to diſmount; and they reſolved to wait,
on ſome high grounds at Ancram, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault of the Engliſh. 
<note place="margin">17th of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary.</note> The Engliſh,
whoſe paſt ſucceſſes had taught them too much to deſpiſe the
enemy, thought, when they ſaw the Scotch horſes led off the field, that the
whole army was retiring; and they haſtened to attack them. The Scotch
received them in good order; and being favoured by the advantage of the ground,
as well as by the ſurprize of the Engliſh, who expected no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
they ſoon put them to flight, and purſued them with a conſiderable
flaughter. Evers and Latoun were both killed, and above a thouſand men were
made priſoners. In order to ſupport the Scotch in this war, Francis, ſome
time after, ſent over a body of auxiliaries, to the number of three
thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, under the command of Montgomery, lord of
Lorges<note n="*" place="bottom">Buchanan, lib. XV. Drummond.</note>. Reinforced
by theſe ſuccours, the regent aſſembled an army of fifteen thouſand
men at Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, and marched thence to ravage the eaſt borders of England.
They laid all waſte wherever they came; and having met with no conſiderable
reſiſtance, they retired into their own country, and diſperſed
themſelves. The earl of Hertford, in revenge, committed ravages on the middle
and weſt marches; and the war on both ſides was ſignalized rather by the
ills inflicted on the enemy, than by any conſiderable advantage gained by
either party.</p>
               <p>THE war likewiſe between France and England was not
diſtinguiſhed this year by any memorable events. Francis had equipped a
fleet of above two hundred fail, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides gallies; and having embarked ſome
land forces on board, he ſent them to make a deſcent in England<note n="†" place="bottom">Beleair. Memoires du Bellay.</note>. They failed to
the Iſle of Wight, where they found the <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0429000101:273"/> Engliſh
fleet lying at anchor in St. Helens. It conſiſted not of above an hundred
fail; and the admiral thought it moſt adviſeable to remain in that road, in
hopes of drawing the French into the narrow paſſages and rocks, which were
unknown to them. The two fleets cannonaded one another for two days; and except
the ſinking of the Mary Roſe, one of the largeſt ſhips of the
Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh fleet, the damage on both ſides was inconſiderable. The French
landed troops in the Iſle of Wight, and committed ravages; but being
repulſed by the militia of the country, they retired to their ſhips, which
ſoon after ſet ſail for France. They were again driven by the wind on the
coaſt of England, where they met with the Engliſh fleet; and a new
cannonading enſued, which proved no more deciſive than the foregoing. It
was indeed ſcarce poſſible, that a fleet at that time could, without
boarding, gain any conſiderable advantage over the enemy. The cannon were
commonly ſo ill ſerved, that a French writer of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs<note n="†" place="bottom">De Langey.</note>obſerves, as a circumſtance ſome what
ſingular, that each of theſe nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fleets in a two hours engagement,
fired full three hundred ſhot. One large ſhip in our time could, without
difficulty, do as much.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS'S chief intention, in equipping ſo great a fleet, was
to prevent the Engliſh from throwing ſuccours into Boulogne, which he
intended to beſiege; and for that purpoſe, he ordered a fort to be built,
by which he propoſed to block up the harbour. After a conſiderable loſs
of money and time, the fort was found ſo ill conſtructed, that he was
obliged to abandon it; and tho' he had brought together, on that frontier, an
army of near forty thouſand men, he was not able to effect any conſiderable
enterprize. He broke into the territory of Oye, an extent of country which lies
near Calais, and which ſerved commonly to ſupply the garriſon with
proviſions; and he laid it entirely waſte by fire and ſword. Several
ſkirmiſhes enſued between the French and Engliſh, in one of which the
duke of Aumale received a remarkable wound. A lance was run into his head
between his eye and noſe; and notwithſtanding that the lance broke and the
head of it remained in the wound, he was not diſmounted by ſo violent a
ſhock, and the head of the lance being extracted by a ſkilful ſurgeon, he
afterwards recovered, and rendered himſelf extremely famous by the name of
the duke of Guiſe. Henry, in order to defend his dominions in France, had
levied fourteen thouſand Germans; who, having marched to Fleurines in the
biſhopric of Liege, found they could advance no farther. The Emperor would
not allow them a paſſage through his dominions: They received intelligence
of a ſuperior army on the ſide of France ready to intercept them:
Idleneſs and want of pay ſoon bred a mutiny among them: And having ſeized
the Engliſh <pb n="269" facs="tcp:0429000101:274"/> commiſſaries as a ſecurity for
arrears, they retreated into their own country. There ſeems to have been
ſome want of foreſight and contrivance in this expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive armament.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A Parliament.</note> THE great expence of
theſe two wars, maintained by Henry, obliged him to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a new
Parliament. The commons granted him a ſubſidy, payable in two years, of two

apprehenſive leſt more demands ſhould be made upon them, thought to
ſave themſelves by a very extraordinary libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of other people's
property; and by one vote they beſtowed on the King the whole revenues of the
univerſities, as well as of the chauntries, free chappels<note n="§" place="bottom">A chauntry was a little church, chappel, or particular altar in

Henry was pleaſed with this conceſſion, as it encreaſed his power; but
he had no intention of deſpoiling learning of all her endowments; and he
ſoon took care to inform the univerſities, that he meant not to touch their
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues. Thus theſe antient and celebrated eſtabliſhments owed their
ſubſiſtance to the generoſity of the King, not to the protection of

a ſpeech to the Parliament on proroguing them; where, after thanking them for
their loving attachment to him, which, he ſaid, equalled what was ever paid
by their anceſtors to any King of England, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of their

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0429000101:275"/> that the ſeveral pulpits were become a kind of
batteries againſt each other; and that one preacher called another heretic
and anabaptiſt, which was retaliated by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probious terms of papiſt and
hypocrite: That he had permitted his people the uſe of the ſcriptures, not
in order to furniſh them materials for diſpute and railing, but that he
might enable them to inform their conſciences and inſtruct their children
and families: That it grieved his heart to find how that precious jewel was
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, by being introduced into the converſation of every alehouſe
and tavern, and employed as a pretence for decrying the ſpiritual and legal
paſtors: And that he was ſorry to obſerve, that the word of God, while it
was the object of ſo much anxious ſpeculation, had very little influence on
their practice; and that tho' an imaginary knowlege ſo much abounded, charity
was daily going to decay<note n="*" place="bottom">Hall, fol 261. Herbert, p.

thouſand men, two thirds of which conſiſted of foreigners. Some
ſkirmiſhes enſued of ſmall conſequence; and no hopes of any
conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs could be entertained by either ſide. Henry,
whoſe animoſity againſt Francis was not violent, had given ſufficient
vent to his humour by this ſhort war; and finding, that from his great
encreaſe in corpulence and decay in ſtrength, he could not hope for much
longer life, he was deſirous of ending a quarrel, which might prove dangerous
to his kingdom during a minority. Francis likewiſe, on his part, was not
averſe to peace with England; becauſe, having lately loſt his ſon, the
duke of Orleans, he revived his antient claim upon Milan, and foreſaw, that
hoſtilities muſt ſoon, on that account, break out between him and the

This debt was ſettled at two millions of livres, beſides a claim of 500,000

Scotland in the treaty. Thus all that Henry obtained by a war, which coſt him

foreign wars, had leiſure to give his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to domeſtic affairs; and
particularly to the eſtabliſhment of uniformity of opinion, on which he was
ſo intent. Tho' he allowed an Engliſh tranſlation of the Bible, he had
hitherto been very careful to keep the maſs in Latin; but he was at laſt
prevailed with to permit, that the Litany, a conſiderable part of the public
wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſhould be celebrated in the vulgar tongue; and by this
innovation, he excited anew the hopes of the reformers, who had been ſomewhat
diſcouraged by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the ſtatute of the ſix articles. One
petition of the new Litany was a prayer to ſave us <hi>from the tyranny of

was employing his authority to engage Henry to farther inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and he
took advantage of Gardiner's abſence, who was employed in an embaſſy to
the emperor; but Gardiner, having wrote to the King, that, if he carried his
oppoſition againſt the catholic religion to greater extremities, Charles
threatened to break off all commerce with him, the ſucceſs of Cranmer's
projects was for the time retarded. Cranmer loſt this year the moſt
ſincere and moſt powerful friend, whom he poſſeſſed at court;
Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk: The Queen dowager of France, ſpouſe to
Suffolk, had died ſome years before. This nobleman is one inſtance, that
Henry was not altogether incapable of a cordial and ſteady friendſhip; and
Suffolk ſeems to have been entirely worthy of that favour, which, from his
earlieſt youth, he had enjoyed with him. The King was ſitting in council
when informed of Suffolk's death; and he took that occaſion both to expreſs
his own ſorrow for the loſs, and to celebrate the merits of the deceaſed.
He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that, during the whole courſe of their correſpondence, he had
not made any attempt to injure an adverſary, and had never whiſpered a word
to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of any one. 
<q rend="inline">"Is there any of you, my lords, who can ſay as

               <p>CRANMER himſelf, when bereaved of this ſupport, was the more
expoſed to thoſe cabals of the courtiers, which the oppoſition of party
and religion, joined to the uſual motives of intereſt, rendered ſo eager
among Henry's miniſters and counſellors. The catholics took advantage of
the King's paſſion for orthodoxy; and they repreſented to him, that, if
his laudable zeal for inforcing the truth met with no greater ſucceſs, it
was owing altogether to the primate, whoſe example and encouragement were, in
reality, the ſecret ſupports of hereſy. Henry, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the point to
which they tended, feigned a compliance, and deſired the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to make
enquiry into Cranmer's conduct; promiſing that, if he was found guilty, he
ſhould ſend him to the Tower, and bring him to condign puniſhment. 
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0429000101:277"/> All the world now gave the primate for loſt; and his
old friends, from merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary views, as well as the oppoſite party, from
animoſity, began to ſhow him marks of neglect and diſregard. He was
obliged to ſtand ſeveral hours among the lacqueys at the door of the
council-chamber, before he could be admitted; and when he was at laſt called
in, he was told, that they had determined to ſend him to the Tower. Cranmer
ſaid, that he appealed to the King himſelf; and finding his appeal
diſregarded, he produced a ring, which Henry had given him as a pledge of
favour and protection. The council were confounded; and when they came before
the King, he reproved them in the ſevereſt terms, and told them, that he
was well acquainted with Cranmer's merit, as well as with their malignity and
envy: But he was determined to cruſh all their cabals, and to teach them, by
the ſevereſt diſcipline, ſince gentle methods were vain, a more dutiful
concurrence in promoting his ſervice. Norfolk, who was Cranmer's capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
enemy, apologized for their conduct, by ſaying, that their only intention was
to ſet the primate's innocence in a full light by bringing him to an open
trial: And Henry obliged them all to embrace him, as a ſign of their cordial
reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The mild temper of Cranmer rendered this reconcilement more
ſincere on his part, than is uſual in ſuch forced compliances<note n="†" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. i. p.

delicate article; and Henry, inſtead of having indulgence to the weakneſs
of her ſex and age, was but the more provoked, that a woman ſhould dare to
oppoſe his theological ſentiments. She was prevailed on by Bonner's
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces to make a ſeeming recantation; but ſhe qualified it with ſome
reſerves, which did not ſatisfy that zealous prelate. She was thrown into
priſon, and there employed herſelf in compoſing prayers and
diſcourſes, by which ſhe forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied her reſolution to endure the
utmoſt extremity rather than relinquiſh her reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious principles. She even
wrote to the King, and told him, that as to the Lord's Supper, ſhe believed
as much as Chriſt himſelf had ſaid of it, and as much of his divine
doctrine as the catholic church had required: But while ſhe could not be
brought to acknowlege an aſſent to the King's explications, this
declaration availed her nothing, and was rather regarded as a freſh inſult.
The chancellor, Wriotheſely, who had ſucceeded Audley, and who was much
attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0429000101:278"/> to the catholic party, was ſent to examine
her with regard to her patrons at court, and the great ladies who were in
correſpondence with her: But ſhe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a very laudible fidelity to
her friends, and would confeſs nothing. She was put to the torture in the
moſt cruel manner, and continued ſtill reſolute in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
ſecrecy. Some authors<note n="†" place="bottom">Fox, vol. ii. p. 578.

cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance: Fox, however, tranſcribes her own paper, where ſhe relates
it. I muſt add, in juſtice to the King, that he diſapproved of
Wriotheſely's conduct, and commended the lieutenant.</note>add a very
extraordinary circumſtance: That the chancellor, who ſtood by, ordered the
lieutenant of the Tower to ſtretch the rack farther; but the lieutenant
refuſed compliance with that cruelty: The chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor menaced him; but met
with a new refuſal: Upon which that magiſtrate, who was otherwiſe a
perſon of merit, but intoxicated with religious zeal, put his own hand to the
rack, and drew it ſo violently that he almoſt tore her body aſunder. Her
conſtancy ſtill ſurpaſſed the barbarity of her perſecutors, and
they found all their efforts to be baffled. She was then condemned to be burned
alive; and being ſo diſlocated by the rack, that ſhe could not ſtand,
ſhe was carried to the ſtake in a chair. Together with her, were brought
Nicholas Belenian, a prieſt, John Laſſels of the King's family, and John
Adams a taylor, who had been condemned for the ſame crime to the ſame
puniſhment. They were all tied to the ſtake; and in that dreadful
ſituation, the chancellor ſent to inform them, that their pardon was ready
drawn and ſigned, and ſhould inſtantly be given them, if they would merit
it by a recantation. They only regarded this offer as a new ornament to their
crown of martyrdom; and they ſaw with tranquillity the executioner kindle the
flames which conſumed them. Wriotheſely did not conſider, that this
public and noted ſituation intereſted their honour the more to maintain a
ſteady perſeverance.</p>
               <p>BUT tho' the ſecrecy and fidelity of Anne Aſcue ſaved the
Queen from this peril, ſhe ſoon after fell into a new danger, from which
ſhe very narrowly eſcaped. There was an ulcer broke out in the King's leg,
which, joined to his extreme corpulency and his bad habit of body, began both
to threaten his life, and to render him, even more than uſual, peeviſh and
paſſionate. The Queen, during this time, attended him with the moſt
tender and dutiful care, and endeavoured, by every ſoothing art and
compliance, to allay thoſe guſts of humour, to which he was become ſo
ſubject. His favourite topic of converſation was theology; and Catherine,
whoſe good ſenſe made her capable of diſcourſing on any ſubject,
was frequently engaged into the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and being ſecretly inclined to the
principles of the reformers, ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily diſcovered too much of her mind
on theſe occaſions. Henry, highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked <pb n="274" facs="tcp:0429000101:279"/> that
ſhe ſhould preſume to differ from him, made complaints of her
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy to Gardiner, who gladly laid hold of the opportunity to inflame
the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. He praiſed the King's anxious care of preſerving the
orthodoxy of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and repreſented, that the more elevated the
perſon was who was chaſtiſed, and the more near to his perſon, the
greater terror would the example ſtrike into every one, and the more glorious
would the ſacrifice appear to all poſterity. The chancellor, being
conſulted, was engaged by religious zeal to ſecond theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics; and
Henry, hurried by his own impetuous temper, and encouraged by his
counſellors, went ſo far as to order articles of impeachment to be drawn up
againſt his conſort. Wriotheſely executed his commands; and ſoon after
brought the paper to him to be ſigned: For as it was high treaſon to throw
ſlander upon the Queen, he might otherwiſe have been queſtioned for his
temerity. In going home, he chanced to drop this important paper from his
pocket; and as ſome perſon of the Queen's party found it, it was
immediately carried to her. She was ſenſible of the extreme danger to which
ſhe was expoſed; but did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of being able, by her prudence and
addreſs, ſtill to elude the efforts of her enemies. She paid her uſual
viſit to the King, and found him in a more ſerene diſpoſition than
ſhe had reaſon to expect. He entered on the ſubject which was ſo
familiar to him, and he ſeemed to challenge her to an argument in divinity.
She gently declined the converſation, and obſerved, that ſuch profound
ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ill ſuited to the natural imbecillity of her ſex.
Women, ſhe ſaid, by their firſt creation, were made ſubject to men: The
male was created after the image of God; the female after the image of the
male: It belonged to the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to chooſe principles for his wife; the
wife's duty was, in all caſes, to adopt implicitely the ſentiments of her
huſband: And as to herſelf, it was doubly her duty, being bleſt with a
huſband, who was qualified, by his judgment and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not only to
chooſe principles for his own family, but for the moſt wiſe and knowing
of every nation. 
<q rend="inline">"Not ſo! by St. Mary," replied the King, "you
are now become a doctor, Kate; and better fitted to give than receive
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions."</q> She meekly replied, that ſhe was ſenſible how
little ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to theſe praiſes; that tho' ſhe uſually
declined not any converſation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſublime, when propoſed by his
majeſty, ſhe well knew, that her concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions could ſerve to no other
purpoſe than to give him a little momentary amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that ſhe found
the converſation apt to languiſh when not revived by ſome oppoſition,
and had ventured ſometimes to feign a contrariety of ſentiments, in order
to give him the pleaſure of refuting her; and that ſhe alſo propoſed,
by this innocent artifice, to engage him into topics, whence, ſhe had
obſerved, by her frequent experience, that ſhe reaped profit and
inſtruction. 
<q rend="inline">"And is it ſo, <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0429000101:280"/>
ſweet-heart?" replied the King, "then are we perfect friends again."</q> He
embraced her with great affection, and ſent her away with aſſurances of
his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and kindneſs. Her enemies, who knew nothing of this turn,
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared next day to convey her to the Tower, purſuant to the King's
warrant. Henry and Catherine were converſing amicably in the garden, when the
chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor appeared with forty of the purſuivants. The King ſpoke to him
at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from her; and ſeemed to expoſtulate with him in the
ſevereſt manner: She even overheard the terms of <hi>knave, fool,</hi> and
<hi>beaſt,</hi> which he very liberally beſtowed upon that magiſtrate;
and then ordered him to depart his preſence. She afterwards interpoſed to
mitigate his anger: He ſaid to her, 
<q rend="inline">"Poor ſoul! you know not how little intitled
this man is to your good offices."</q> From thenceforth, the Queen, having
narrowly eſcaped ſo great a danger, was careful not to offend Henry's
humour by any contradiction; and Gardiner, whoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice had endeavoured to
widen the breach, could never afterwards recover his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and good
opinion<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. i. p. 344. Herbert, p. 560. Speed,

               <p>BUT Henry's tyrannical diſpoſition, ſoured by ill health,
burſt out ſoon after to the deſtruction of a man, who poſſeſſed a
much ſuperior rank to Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The duke of Norfolk and his father, during
this whole reign, and even a great part of the foregoing, had been regarded as
the greateſt ſubjects in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and had rendered very conſiderable
ſervices to the crown. The duke himſelf had in his youth diſtinguiſhed
himſelf by naval enterprizes: He had much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the victory over
the Scotch at Flouden: He had ſuppreſſed a dangerous rebellion in the
North: And he had always done his part with honour in all the expeditions
againſt France. Fortune ſeemed to conſpire with his own induſtry, in
raiſing him to the higheſt elevation. By the favours heaped on him from the
crown, he had acquired an immenſe eſtate: The King had ſucceſſively
been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to two of his nieces; and the King's ſon, the duke of Richmond,
had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his daughter: Beſides his deſcent from the antient family of
the Moubrays, by which he was allied to the throne, he had eſpouſed a
daughter of the duke of Buckingham, who was deſcended by a female from Edward
the third: And as he was believed ſtill to adhere ſecretly to the antient
religion, he was regarded, abroad and at home, as the head of the catholic
party. But all theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in proportion as they exalted the
duke, provoked the jealouſy of Henry; and he ſoreſaw danger, during his
ſon's minority, both to the public tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and to the new
eccleſiaſtical ſyſtem, from the attempts of ſo potent a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
But nothing tended more to expoſe Norfolk to the King's vengeance, 
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0429000101:281"/> than the prejudices, which Henry had entertained
againſt the earl of Surrey, ſon to that nobleman.</p>
               <p>SURREY was a young man of the moſt promiſing hopes, and had
diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf by every accompliſhment, which became a
ſcholar, a courtier, and a ſoldier. He excelled in all the military
exerciſes, which were then in requeſt: He encouraged the fine arts by his
patronage and example: He had made ſome ſucceſsful attempts in poetry;
and being ſmit with the romantic gallantry of that age, he celebrated his
miſtreſs's praiſe by his pen and his lance, in every maſque and
tournament. His ſpirit and ambition were equal to his talents and his
quality; and he did not always regulate his conduct by that caution and
reſerve, which his ſituation required. He had been left governor of
Boulogne, when that town was taken by Henry; but tho' his perſonal bravery
was unqueſtioned, he had been unfortunate in ſome rencounters with the
French. The King, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſpleaſed with his conduct, had ſent over
Hertford to command in his place; and Surrey was ſo imprudent as to drop
ſome menacing expreſſions againſt the miniſters, on account of this
affront, which was put upon him. And as he had refuſed to marry Hertford's
daughter, and even waved every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of marriage, which were made him;
Henry imagined, that he had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained views of eſpouſing the lady Mary;
and he was inſtantly determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, by the moſt ſevere
expedients, ſo dangerous an ambition.</p>
               <p>ACTUATED by all theſe motives, and perhaps too influenced by
that old diſguſt, with which the ill conduct of Catherine Howard had
inſpired him againſt all her family, he gave private orders to arreſt
Norfolk and Surrey; and they were on the ſame day confined to the Tower.

His <pb n="277" facs="tcp:0429000101:282"/> dutcheſs, with whom he lived on bad terms, had

his accuſers diſcovered no greater crime, than that he had once ſaid,
that the King was ſickly, and could not hold out long, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was
likely to fall into diſorders, thro' the diverſity of religious opinions.
He wrote a m ſt pathetic letter to the King, pleading his paſt ſervices,

he ſent a meſſage to the commons, by which he deſired them to haſten

and it was neceſſary to appoint another, who might officiate at the
enſuing ceremony of inſtalling his ſon, prince of Wales. The obſequious
commons obeyed his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, tho' founded on ſo frivolous a pretence; and
the King, having affixed the royal aſſent to the bill by commiſſioners,
iſſued orders for the execution of Norfolk on the morning of the twenty
ninth of January. But news being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Tower, that the King himſelf
had expired that night, the lieutenant deferred the execution of the warrant,
and it was not thought adviſable by the council, to begin a new reign by the
death of the greateſt nobleman in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who had been condemned by a
ſentence ſo unjuſt and tyrannical.</p>
               <p>THE King's health had been long in a very declining condition;
but for ſeveral days all thoſe near him plainly ſaw his death
approaching. He was become ſo froward, that no one durſt inform him of his
condition; and as ſome perſons, during this reign, had been puniſhed as
traitors for foretelling the King's death<note n="†" place="bottom">Lanquet's Epitome of chronicles in the year 1541.</note>, every
one was afraid, left, in the tranſports of his fury, he might, on this

At laſt, Sir Anthony Denny ventured to diſcloſe to him the fatal
ſecret, and exhorted him to prepare for the fate which was awaiting him. He
expreſſed his reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0429000101:283"/> and deſired that
Cranmer might be ſent for: But before that prelate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, he was

               <p>THE King had made his will near a month before his deceaſe;
where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the deſtination of Parliament, in leaving the crown
firſt to prince Edward, then to the lady Mary, next to the lady Elizabeth:
The two princeſſes he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, under the penalty of forfeiting their title
to the crown, not to marry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of the council, which he
appointed for the government of his minor ſon. After his own children, he
ſettled the ſucceſſion on Frances Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, marchioneſs of Dorſet,
eldeſt daughter to his ſiſter, the French Queen; then on Eleonor,
counteſs of Cumberland, the ſecond daughter. In paſſing over the
poſterity of the Queen of Scots, his eldeſt ſiſter, he made uſe of
the power obtained from Parliament; but as he ſubjoined, that after the
failure of the French Queen's poſterity, the crown ſhould deſcend to the
next lawful heir, it afterwards became a queſtion, whether theſe words
could be applied to the Scottiſh line. It was thought, that theſe princes
were not the next heirs after the houſe of Suffolk, but before that houſe,
and that Henry, by expreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this manner, meant entirely to
exclude them. The late injuries which he had received from the Scotch, had
irritated him extremely againſt that nation; and he maintained to the laſt
the character of violence and caprice, by which his life had been ſo much
diſtinguiſhed. Another circumſtance of his will may ſuggeſt the
ſame reflection with regard to the ſtrange contrarieties of his temper and
conduct: He left money for maſſes to be ſaid for delivering his ſoul
from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory; and tho' he deſtroyed all thoſe inſtitutions,
eſtabliſhed by his anceſtors, and others, for the benefit of
<hi>their</hi> ſouls, and had even left the doctrine of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory doubtful
in all the articles of faith which he publiſhed during his latter years, he
was yet determined, when matters came to the laſt, to take care, at leaſt,
of his own future repoſe, and to adhere to the ſafer ſide of the
queſtion<note n="†" place="bottom">See his will in Fuller, Heylin, and
Rymer, p. 110. There is no reaſonable ground to ſuſpect its
authenticity.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His character.</note> IT is difficult to give
a juſt ſummary of this prince's qualities: He was ſo different from
himſelf in different parts of his reign, that, as is well remarked by lord
Herbert, his hiſtory is his beſt character and deſcription. The
abſolute, uncontrouled authority which he maintained at home, and the regard
which he acquired among foreign nations, are circumſtances which entitle him
to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of a <hi>great</hi> prince; while his tyranny, and cruelty,
ſeem to exclude him <pb n="279" facs="tcp:0429000101:284"/> from the character of a
<hi>good</hi> one. He poſſeſſed, indeed, great vigour of mind, which
qualified him for exerciſing dominion over men; courage, intrepidity,
vigilance, inflexibility: And tho' theſe qualities lay not always under the
guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a regular and folid judgment, they were accompanied with good
parts, and an extenſive capacity; and every one dreaded a conteſt with a
man who was known never to yield, or to forgive, and who, in every
controverſy, was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, either to ruin himſelf or his antagoniſt. A
catalogue of his vices would comprehend many of the worſt qualities incident
to human nature: Violence, cruelty, profuſion, rapacity, injuſtice,
obſtinacy, arrogance, bigotry, preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, caprice: But neither was he
ſubject to all theſe vices in the moſt extreme degree, nor was he, at
intervals, altogether devoid of virtues: He was ſincere, open, gallant,
liberal, and capable at leaſt of a temporary friendſhip and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In
this reſpect he was unfortunate, that the incidents of his times ſerved to
diſplay his faults in their full light: The treatment which he met with from
the court of Rome, provoked him to violence; the danger of a revolt from his
ſuperſtitious ſubjects, ſeemed to require the moſt extreme
ſeverity. But it muſt, at the ſame time, be acknowledged, that his
ſituation tended to throw an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal luſtre on what was great and
magnanimous in his character: The emulation between the emperor and the French
King, rendered his alliance, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his impolitic conduct, of great
importance in Europe: The extenſive powers of his prerogative, and the
ſubmiſſive, not to ſay ſlaviſh, diſpoſition of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
made it the more eaſy for him to aſſume and maintain that entire
domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by which his reign is ſo much diſtinguiſhed in the Engliſh
hiſtory.</p>
               <p>IT may ſeem a little extraordinary, that notwithſtanding his
cruelty, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, his violence, his arbitrary adminiſtration, this
prince not only acquired the regard of his ſubjects; but never was the object
of their hatred: He ſeems even in ſome degree to have poſſeſſed, to
the laſt, their love and affection<note n="‡" place="bottom">Strype, vol
I. p. 389.</note>. His exterior qualities were advantageous, and fit to
captivate the multitude: His magnificence and perſonal bravery rendered him
illuſtrious in vulgar eyes: And it may be ſaid, with truth, that the
Engliſh in that age, were ſo thoroughly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, that, like eaſtern
ſlaves, they were inclined to admire even thoſe acts of violence and
tyranny, which were exerciſed over themſelves, and at their own

               <p>WITH regard to foreign ſtates, Henry appears long to have
ſupported an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of friendſhip with Francis, more ſincere and
diſintereſted than uſually takes place between neighbouring princes.
Their common jealouſy of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Charles, and ſome reſemblance in
their characters, (tho' the compariſon is <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0429000101:285"/> extremely to
the advantage of the French monarch) ſerved as the cement of their mutual
amity. Francis is ſaid to have been affected with the King's death, and to
have expreſſed much regret for the loſs. His own health began to decline:
He foretold, that he would not long ſurvive his friend<note n="*" place="bottom">Le Thou.</note>: And he died in about two months after him.</p>
               <p>THERE were ten Parliaments ſummoned by Henry the eighth, and
twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>three ſeſſions held. The whole time in which theſe Parliaments
ſat during this long reign, exceeded not three years and a half. It amounted
not to a year dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt twenty years. The innovations in religion
obliged him afterwards to call theſe aſſemblies more frequently: But tho'
theſe were the moſt important tranſactions that ever fell under the
cognizance of Parliament, their devoted at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to Henry's will, joined to
their earneſt deſire of returning ſoon to their country ſeats, produced
a very quick diſpatch of the bills, and made the ſeſſions of ſhort
duration. All the King's caprices were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indeed, blindly complied with, and
no regard was payed to the ſafety or liberty of the ſubject. Beſides the
vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent proſecution of whatever he was pleaſed to call hereſy, the laws
of treaſon were multiplied beyond all former precedent. Even words to the
diſparagement of the King, Queen, or royal iſſue, were ſubjected to
that penalty; and ſo little care was taken in framing theſe rigorous
ſtatutes, that they contain obvious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions; inſomuch, that, had
they been ſtrictly executed, every man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, muſt have
fallen under the penalty of treaſon. By one ſtatute<note n="†" place="bottom">28 Hen. VIII. c. 7.</note>, for inſtance, it was
declared treaſon to aſſert the validity of the King's marriage, either
with Catherine of Arragon, or Anne Bo'eyn: By another<note n="‡" place="bottom">34, 35 Hen. VIII. c 1.</note>, it was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay any
thing to the diſparagement or ſlander of the princeſſes, Mary and
Elizabeth; and to call them ſpurious would, no doubt, be conſtrued to their
ſlander. Nor would even a profound ſilence with regard to theſe delicate
points, be able to ſave a perſon from ſuch penalties. For by the former
ſtatute, whoever refuſed to anſwer upon oath to any point contained in
that act, was ſubjected to the pains of treaſon. The King, therefore,
needed only to propoſe to any one a queſtion with regard to the legality of
either of his firſt marriages: If the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was ſilent, he was a
traytor by law: If he anſwered, either in the negative or in the affirmative,
he was no leſs a traytor. So monſtrous were the inconſiſtencies, which
aroſe from the furious paſſions of the King, and the ſlaviſh
obedience of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments. It is hard to ſay, whether theſe
contradictions were owing to Henry's precipitancy, or to a formed deſign of
tyranny.</p>

recapitulate whatever is memorable in the ſtatutes of this reign, whether
with regard to police or commerce: Nothing can better <pb n="281" facs="tcp:0429000101:286"/>
ſhow the genius of the age than ſuch a review of the laws. The abolition of
the ancient religion contributed much to the regular execution of juſtice.
While the catholic ſuperſtition ſubſiſted, there was no
poſſibility of puniſhing any crimes in the clergy: The church would not
allow the magiſtrate to try the offences of her members, and ſhe could not
herſelf inflict any civil penalties upon them. But Henry reſtrained theſe
pernicious exemptions: The privilege of clergy was aboliſhed for the crimes
of petty treaſon, murder, and felony, to all under the degree of a
ſubdeacon<note n="‡" place="bottom">23 Hen. VIII. c. 1.</note>. But the
former ſuperſtition not only protected crimes in the clergy: It exempted
alſo the laity from puniſhment, by affording them ſhelter in the churches
and ſanctuaries. The Parliament reſtrained theſe abuſes. It was firſt
declared, that no fanctuaries were allowed in caſes of high treaſon<note n="‖" place="bottom">26 Hen. VIII. c. 13.</note>; next, in thoſe of
murder, felony, rapes, burglary, and petty-treaſon<note n="§" place="bottom">32 Hen. VIII. c. 12.</note>: And it limited them in other
particulars<note n="**" place="bottom">22 Hen. VIII. c. 14.</note>. The only
expedient employed to ſupport the military ſpirit during this age, was the
reviving and extending ſome old laws, enacted for the encouragement of
archery, on which the defence of the kingdom was ſuppoſed very much to
depend. Every man was ordered to have a bow<note n="††" place="bottom">3 Hen. VIII. c. 3.</note>: Buts were ordered to be erected in
every pariſh<note n="‡‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>: And every
bowyer was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, for each bow of yew which he made, to make two of elm or
wich, for the ſervice of the common people<note n="‖‖" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The uſe of croſs-bows and hand-guns was alſo
prohibited<note n="§§" place="bottom">3 Hen. VIII. c. 13.</note>. What
rendered the Engliſh bowmen more formidable was, that they carried halberts
with them, by which they were enabled, upon occaſion, to engage in cloſe
fight with the enemy<note n="¶" place="bottom">Herbert.</note>. Frequent
muſters or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rays were alſo made of the people, even during time of peace;
and all men of ſubſtance were obliged to have a compleat ſuit of armour
or harneſs, as it was called<note n="*" place="bottom">Hall, fol. 234. Stowe,
p. 515. Hollingſhed, p. 947.</note>. The martial ſpirit of the Engliſh,
during that age, rendered this precaution, it was thought, ſufficient for the
defence of the nation; and as the King had then an abſolute power of
commanding the ſervice of all his ſubjects, he could preſently, in caſe
of danger, appoint new officers, and levy regiments, and collect an army as
numerous as he pleaſed. Where no faction or diviſion prevailed among the
people, there was no foreign power that ever dared to think of invading
England. There is a ſaying of Francis the firſt, which ſhows the
eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in which the nation was held in Europe. That magnanimous prince
boaſted, that, notwithſtanding the combination of Charles and Henry
againſt him, in the year 1524, he would be able to defend himſelf. Spain,
ſays he, has no money; the Low Countries have no ſoldiers: And as to
England, my fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0429000101:287"/> is ſtrong on that ſide<note n="†" place="bottom">P. Daniel.</note>. The city of London alone could

men<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hall, fol. 235. Hollingſhed, p. 547.

theſe troops; tho' the garriſon of Calais was a nurſery of officers; and
Tournay firſt<note n="‖" place="bottom">Hall, fol. 68.</note>,
Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lougne afterwards, ſerved to increaſe the number, Every one, who
ſerved abroad, was allowed to alienate his lands without paying any fees<note n="†" place="bottom">14 and 15 Hen. VIII. c. 15.</note>. A general
permission was granted to diſpoſe of land by will<note n="**" place="bottom">34 and 35 Hen. VIII. c. 5.</note>. The Parliament were ſo little
jealous of their privileges, (which indeed were ſcarce worth preſerving)
that there is an inſtance of one Strode, who, becauſe he introduced into
the lower houſe ſome bill regarding tin, was very ſeverely treated by the
Stannery courts of Cornwal: Heavy fines were impoſed on him; and upon his
refuſal to pay, he was thrown into a dungeon, loaded with irons, and uſed
in ſuch a manner as brought his life in danger: Yet all the notice which the
Parliament took of this enormity, even in ſuch an inferior court, was to
enact, that no man could be queſtioned afterwards for his conduct in
Parliament<note n="††" place="bottom">4 Hen. VIII. c. 8.</note>.
This prohibition, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, muſt only be extended to the inferior courts: For
as to the King and privy council, and ſtar-chamber, they were ſcarce bound
by any law. There is a bill of tonnage and poundage, which ſhows what
uncertain ideas the Parliament had formed both of their own privileges and of
the rights of the ſovereign<note n="‡‡" place="bottom">6 Hen.
VIII. c. 14.</note>. This duty had been voted to every King ſince Edward the
fourth, during the term of his own life: Yet Henry had already been allowed to
levy it ſix years without any law; and tho' there had been four Parliaments
aſſembled, no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention had been given either to grant it to him
regularly, or reſtrain him from levying it. At laſt, they reſolved to
give him that ſupply; but even in this conceſſion, they ſhow
themſelves plainly at a loſs to determine whether they grant it, or whether
he has a right of himſelf to levy it. They ſay, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was
made to endure during the natural life of the late King, and no longer: They
yet blame the merchants who had not paid to the preſent King that duty: They
obſerve, that the law for tonnage and poundage was expired; yet make no
ſcruple to call that impoſition the King's due: They affirm, that he had
ſuſtained great and manifold loſſes by thoſe who had defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him
of this duty: And to provide a remedy, they vote him that ſupply dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his
life, and no longer. It is remarkable, that notwithſtanding this laſt
clauſe, all his ſucceſſors, for more than a century, continued in the
like irregular practice: If a practice may deſerve that epithet, which all
the world acquieſced in, and which gave no offence. But when Charles the
firſt attempted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0429000101:288"/> in the ſame courſe,
which had now received the ſanction of many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo much were the
opinions of men altered, that a furious tempeſt was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by it, and
hiſtorians, partial or ignorant, ſtill repreſent that meaſure as a
moſt violent and unprecedented enormity in that unhappy prince.</p>
               <p>THE foreign commerce of England, during this age, was moſtly
confined to the Netherlands. The inhabitants of the Low Countries bought the
Engliſh commodities, and diſtributed them into the other parts of Europe.
Hence the mutual dependance of theſe countries on each other; and the great
loſs ſuſtained by both, in caſe of a rupture. During all the variations
of politics, the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns always avoided the coming to this extremity; and
tho' the King bore a much greater friendſhip to Francis, the propenſity of
the nation always lay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the emperor.</p>
               <p>IN 1528, hoſtilities commenced between England and the Low
Countries; but were ſoon ſtopt by mutual agreement. While the Flemiſh
were not allowed to purchaſe cloth in England, the Engliſh merchants could
not buy it of the cloathiers, and the cloathiers were obliged to diſmiſs
their workmen, who began to be tumultuous for want of bread. The cardinal, to
appeaſe them, ſent for the merchants, and ordered them to buy cloth as
uſual: They told him, that they could not diſpoſe of it as uſual; and
notwithſtanding all his menaces, he could get no other anſwer from
them<note n="*" place="bottom">Hall, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>olio 174.</note>. An agreement was at laſt made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the
commerce between the ſtates, even during war.</p>
               <p>THE foreign artificers much ſurpaſſed the Engliſh in
dexterity, induſtry, and frugality; and hence the violent animoſity, which
the latter, on many occaſions, expreſſed againſt any of the former who
were ſettled in England. They had the aſſurance to complain, that all
their cuſtomers went to foreign tradeſmen; and in the year 1517, being
moved by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>editious ſermons of
one Dr. Bele, and the intrigues of Lincoln, a broker, they raiſed an
inſurrection. The appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, and others of the poorer ſort, in London,
began by breaking up the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, where ſome perſons were confined for
inſulting foreigners. They next pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the houſe of Meutas, a
Frenchman, much hated by them; where they committed great diſorders; killed
ſome of his ſervants, and plundered his goods. The mayor could not
appeaſe them; nor Sir Thomas Moore, late under ſheriff, tho' extremely
reſpected in the city. They alſo threatned cardinal Wolſey with ſome
inſult; and he thought it neceſſary to fortify his houſe, and put
himſelf on his guard. Tired at laſt with theſe diſorders, they
diſperſed themſelves; and the earls of Shrewſbury and Surrey ſeized
ſome of them. A proclamation was <pb n="284" facs="tcp:0429000101:289"/> iſſued, that
women ſhould not meet together to babble and talk, and that all men ſhould
keep their wives in their houſes. Next day the duke of Norfolk came into the
city, at the head of thirteen hundred armed men, and made enquiry into the
tumult. Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Lincoln, and thirteen more were executed. The other perſons, to the number of
four hundred, were brought before the King with ropes about their necks, fell
on their knees, and cried for mercy. Henry knew at that time to pardon; he
diſmiſſed them all without further puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="*" place="bottom">Stowe, 505. Hollingſhed, 840.</note>.</p>
               <p>SO great was the number of foreign artizans in the city, that at
leaſt fifteen thouſand Flemiſh alone were at one time obliged to leave
it, by an order from the council, when Henry became jealous of their favour for
Queen Catherine<note n="†" place="bottom">Le Grand, vol. III. p.
232.</note>. Henry himſelf confeſſes, in an edict of the ſtar-chamber,
printed among the ſtatutes, that the foreigners ſtarved the natives; and
obliged them from idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to have recourſe to theft, murder, and other
enormities<note n="‡" place="bottom">21 Hen. VIII.</note>. He alſo
aſſerts, that the vaſt multitudes of the foreigners raiſed the price of
grain and bread<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. And to prevent the
increaſe of the evil, all foreign artificers were prohibited to have above
two foreigners in their houſe, either journeymen or apprentices. A like
jealoufy aroſe againſt the foreign merchants; and to comply with it, a law
was enacted obliging all denizons to pay the duties impoſed upon aliens<note n="§" place="bottom">22 Hen. VIII. c. 8.</note>. The Parliament had done
better to have encouraged foreign merchants and artizans to come over to
England; which might have excited the emulation of the natives, and improved
their ſkill. The priſoners in the kingdom, for debts and crimes, are
aſſerted, in an act of parliament, to be ſixty thouſand perſons and
above<note n="**" place="bottom">3 Hen. VIII. c. 15.</note>.</p>
               <p>THERE is a remarkable clauſe in a ſtatute paſſed near
the beginning of this reign<note n="††" place="bottom">3 Hen. VIII.
c. 8.</note>, by which we might be induced to believe, that England was
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely decayed from the flouriſhing condition which it had attained in
former times. It had been enacted in the reign of Edward the ſecond, that no
magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in town or borough, who by his office ought to keep aſſize,
ſhould, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the continuance of his magiſtracy, fell either in
wholeſale or retail, any wine or victuals. This law ſeemed very equitable,
in order to prevent fraud or bye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends in fixing the aſſize: Yet the law is
repealed in this reign. The reaſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned is, that 
<q rend="inline">"ſince the making of that ſtatute and
ordinance, many and the moſt part of all the cities, boroughs, and towns
corporate, within the realm of England, are fallen in ruin and decay, and are
not inhabited by merchants, <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0429000101:290"/> and men of ſuch
ſubſtance as at the time of making that ſtatute: For at this day, the
dwellers and inhabitants of the ſame cities and boroughs are commonly bakers,
vintners, fiſhmongers, and other victualers, and there remain few others to
bear the offices."</q> Men have ſuch a propenſity to exalt paſt times
beyond the preſent, that it ſeems dangerous to credit this reaſoning of
the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without further evidence to ſupport it. So different are the
views in which the ſame object appears, that ſome may be inclined to draw
an oppoſite inference from this fact. A more regular police was establiſhed
in the reign of Henry the eighth, and a ſtricter adminiſtration of
juſtice; and advantage which induced the men of property to leave the
provincial towns, and to retire into the country. Cardinal Wolſey, in a
ſpeech to the Parliament, repreſented it as a proof of the increaſe of
riches, that the cuſtoms had increaſed beyond what they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly<note n="*" place="bottom">Hall, folio 110.</note>.</p>
               <p>BUT if there was really a decay of commerce and induſtry, and
population in England, the ſtatutes of this reign, except by aboliſhing
monaſteries, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching holidays, a circumſtance of conſiderable
moment, were not in other reſpects well calculated to revive them. The fixing
the wages of artificers was attempted<note n="†" place="bottom">6 Hen.
VIII. c. 3.</note>: Luxury in apparel was prohibited, by repeated
ſtatutes<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Hen. VIII. c. 14. 6 Hen. VIII. c.
1. 7 Hen. VIII. c. 7.</note>; and probably without ſucceſs. The chancellor
and other miniſters were empowered to fix the price of poultry, cheeſe, and
butter<note n="‖" place="bottom">25 Hen. VIII. c. 2.</note>. A ſtatute
was even paſſed to fix the price of beef, pork, mutton, and veal<note n="§" place="bottom">24 Hen. VIII. c. 3.</note>. Beef and pork were ordered
to be ſold at a halfpenny a pound: Mutton and veal at a halfpenny half a
far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The preamble of the ſtatute ſays, that theſe four ſpecies of
butcher's meat were the food of the poorer ſort. This act was afterwards
repealed<note n="**" place="bottom">33 Hen. VIII. c. 11.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE practice of depopulating the country, by abandoning tillage,
and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lands into paſturage, ſtill continued<note n="††" place="bottom">Strype, vol. I. p. 392.</note>; as appears by
the new laws which were enacted againſt that practice. The King was entitled
to half the rents of the land, where any farm houſes were allowed to go to
decay<note n="‡‡" place="bottom">6 Hen. VIII. c. 5. 7 Hen. VIII. c.
1.</note>. The unſkilful huſbandry was probably the cauſe why the
proprietors found no profit in tillage. The number of ſheep allowed to be
kept in one flock, was reſtrained to two thouſand<note n="‖‖" place="bottom">25 Hen. VIII. c. 13.</note>. Sometimes, ſays the ſtatute, one
proprietor or farmer would keep a flock of twenty-four thouſand. It is
remarkable, that the Parliament aſcribes the increaſing price of ſheep
and mutton, to this increaſe of ſheep: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſay they, the
commodity being got into few hands, the price of it is raiſed 
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0429000101:291"/> at pleaſure<note n="§§" place="bottom">25 Hen.
VIII. c. 13.</note>. It is probable, that the effect proceeded from the daily
increaſe of money: For it is impoſſible, that ſuch a commodity could be
monopolized. Intereſt was fixed during this reign at ten per cent<note n="*" place="bottom">37 Hen. VIII. c 9.</note>.</p>
               <p>SOME laws were made with regard to beggars and vagabonds<note n="†" place="bottom">22 Hen. VIII. c. 12. 22 Hen. VIII. c. 5.</note>; one
of the circumſtances in government, which humanity would moſt powerfully
recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to a benevolent legiſlator; which ſeems, at firſt fight, the
moſt eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted; and which is yet the moſt difficult to ſettle
in ſuch a manner, as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the end without deſtroying induſtry. The
convents formerly were a ſupport to the poor; but at the ſame
time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>tended to encourage idleneſs and beggary.</p>
               <p>HENRY, as he poſſeſſed himſelf ſome talents for
letters, was an encourager of them in others. He founded Trinity college in
Cambridge, and gave it very ample endowments. Wolſey founded Chriſt Church
in Oxford, and intended to call it Cardinal college: But upon his fall, which
happened before he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely finiſhed his ſcheme, the King ſeized all
the revenues; and this violence, above all the other misfortunes of that great
miniſter, is ſaid to have given him the greateſt anxiety and concern<note n="‡" place="bottom">Strype, vol. I. p. 117.</note>. But Henry afterwards
reſtored the revenues of the college, and only changed the name. The cardinal
founded in Oxford the firſt chair for teaching Greek; and this novelty rent
that univerſity into the moſt violent factions, which frequently came to
blows. The whole ſtudents di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided themſelves into parties, which bore the
names of Greeks and Trojans, and ſometimes fought with as great animoſity
as was formerly exerciſed by thoſe hoſtile nations. The riſe of the
Greek language in Oxford, excited the emulation of Cambridge<note n="‖" place="bottom">Wood's hiſt. &amp; ant. Oxon. lib. I. p. 245.</note>. Wolſey
intended to have enriched the library of his college at Oxford, with copies of
all the manuſcripts that were in the Vatican<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. 249.</note>. The counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance given to letters by this King
and his miniſters, contributed to render learning faſhionable in England;
and Eraſmus ſpeaks with great ſatisfaction of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral regard paid by
the nobility and gentry of that kingdom to men of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<note n="**" place="bottom">Epiſt. ad Baniſium Alſo epiſt. p. 368.</note>. It is
needleſs to be particular in mentioning the writers of this reign, or of the
preceding. There is no man in that age, who had the leaſt pretenſion to be
ranked among our claſſics. Sir Thomas More, tho' he wrote in Latin, ſeems
to come the neareſt to that character.</p>

by the regulations, which he impoſed on the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his infant ſon,
as well as by the limitations of the ſucceſſion, had projected to reign
even after his deceaſe; and he imagined, that his miniſters, who had always
been ſo obſequious to him during his life-time, would never afterwards
depart from the plan, which he had traced out to them. He fixed the majority of
the Prince at the completion of his eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year; and as Edward was at
preſent only a few months paſt nine, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſixteen executors; to
whom, during the minority, he entruſted the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0429000101:293"/> of the King and kingdom. Their names were, Cranmer, archbiſhop of
Canterbury; lord Wriotheſley, chancellor; lord St. John, great maſter; lord
Ruſſel, privy ſeal; the earl of Hertford, chamberlain; viſcount
Liſle, admiral; Tonſtal, biſhop of Durham; Sir Anthony Brown, maſter of
horſe; Sir William Paget, ſecretary of ſtate; Sir Edward North,
chancellor of the court of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations; Sir Edward Montague, chief juſtice
of the common pleas; judge Bromley, Sir Anthony Denny, and Sir William Herbert,
chief gentlemen of the privy chamber; Sir Edward Wotton, treaſurer of Calais;
Dr. Wotton, dean of Canterbury. To theſe ſixteen executors, with whom was
entruſted the whole regal authority, were added twelve counſellors, who
poſſeſſed no immediate power, and could only aſſiſt with their
advice, when any affair was laid before them. The council was compoſed of the
earls of Arundel and Eſſex; Sir Thomas Cheyney, treaſurer of the

The uſual caprice of Henry appears ſomewhat in this nomination; while he
appointed ſeveral perſons of inferior ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among his executors, and
gave only the place of counſellor to a perſon of ſuch high rank as the
earl of Arundel, and to Sir Thomas Seymour, the King's uncle.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Innovations in the regency.</note> BUT the
firſt act of the executors and counſellors was to depart from the
deſtination of the late King in a material article. No ſooner were they
met, than it was ſuggeſted, that the government would loſe its dignity,
for want of ſome head, who might repreſent the royal majeſty, who might
receive addreſſes from foreign ambaſſadors, to whom diſpatches from
Engliſh miniſters abroad might be carried, and whoſe name might be
employed in all orders and proclamations: And as the King's will ſeemed to
contain a defect in this particular, it was concluded ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to
ſupply it, by chooſing a protector; who, tho' he ſhould poſſeſs all
the exterior ſymbols of royal dignity, ſhould yet be bound, in every
exerciſe of power, to follow the opinion of the executors<note n="†" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 5.</note>. This propoſal was very
diſagreeable to chancellor Wriotheſely. That magiſtrate, a man of an
active ſpirit and high ambition, found himſelf, by his office, entitled to
the firſt rank in the regency after the primate; and as he knew, that that
prelate had no talent nor inclination for ſtate affairs, he hoped, that the
direction of public buſineſs would of courſe devolve in a great meaſure
upon himſelf. He oppoſed, therefore, this propoſal of chooſing a
protector; and repreſented that innovation as an infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King's
will, which, being corroborated by act of parliament, ought 
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0429000101:294"/> in every thing to be a law to them, and could not be
altered but by the ſame authority, which had eſtabliſhed it. The
executors and counſellors were moſtly courtiers, who had been raiſed by
Henry's favour, not men of high birth or great dependances; and as they had
been ſufficiently accuſtomed to ſubmiſſion during the reign of the
late monarch, and had no pretenſions to govern the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by their own
authority, they acquieſced the more willingly in a propoſal, which ſeemed
calculated for preſerving public peace and tranquillity. 
<note place="margin">Somerſet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector.</note> It being
therefore agreed to name a protector, the choice fell of courſe on the earl
of Hartford, who, as he was the King's maternal uncle, was ſtrongly
intereſted in his ſafety; and having no pretenſions to inherit the crown,
could never have any ſeparate intereſt, which might engage him to endanger
Edward's perſon or his authority<note n="*" place="bottom">Heylin, Hiſt. Ref.
Edw. VI.</note>. The public were informed by proclamation of this change in the
adminiſtration; and diſpatches were ſent to all foreign courts to give
them intimation of it. All thoſe poſſeſſed of any office reſigned
their former commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and took out new ones in the name of the young
King. The biſhops themſelves were conſtrained to make a like
ſubmiſſion. Care was taken to inſert in their new commiſſions, that
they held their office during pleaſure<note n="†" place="bottom">Collier, vol. ii. p. 218. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 6. Strype's Mem. of

originally derived from the crown<note n="‡" place="bottom">Strype's
Memor. of Cranm. p. 141.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE executors ſhowed, in their next meaſure, a more
ſubmiſſive deference to Henry's will; becauſe many of them found their
own account in it. The late King had intended, before his death, to make a new
creation of nobility, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſupply the place of thoſe who had fallen
by former attainders, or the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure of iſſue; and that he might enable
the perſons to ſupport their new dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he had reſolved either to
beſtow eſtates on them, or advance them to higher offices. He had even gone
ſo far as to inform them of this reſolution; and in his will, he charged
his executors to make good all his promiſes<note n="§" place="bottom">Fuller, Heylin, and Rymer.</note>. That they might aſcertain his
intentions in the moſt authentic manner, Sir William Paget, Sir Anthony
Denny, and Sir William Herbert, with whom Henry had always converſed in a
familiar manner, were called before the board of regency; and having given
evidence of what they knew concerning the King's promiſes, their teſtimony
was relied on, and the executors proceeded to the fulfilling theſe
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements. Hartford was created duke of Somerſet, marſchal and lord
trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer; 
<note place="margin">17th of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary.</note> Wriotheſely, earl

Edward Sheffield, accepted the title of baron<note n="*" place="bottom">Stow's
Annals, p. 594.</note>: Several, to whom the ſame dignity was offered,
refuſed it; becauſe the other part of the King's promiſe, the beſtowing
eſtates on theſe new noblemen, was deferred till a more convenient
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. Some of them, however, particularly Somerſet the protector,
were, in the mean time, endowed with ſpiritual preferments, deanories and
preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries. For among many other invaſions of eccleſiaſtical
privileges and properties, this irregular practice, of beſtowing ſpiritual
benefices on laymen, began now to prevail.</p>
               <p>THE earl of Southampton had always been engaged in an oppoſite
party to Somerſet; and it was not likely that factions, which had ſecretly
prevailed, even during the arbitrary reign of Henry, ſhould be
ſuppreſſed in the weak adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which uſually attends a
minority. The former nobleman, that he might have the greater leiſure for
attending to ſtate-affairs, had, of himſelf and from his own authority, put
the great ſeal in commiſſion, and had empowered four lawyers, Southwel,
Tregonel, Oliver, and Bellaſis, to execute in his abſence the office of
chancellor. This meaſure ſeems very exceptionable; and the more ſo, that
two of the commiſſioners being canoniſts, the lawyers ſuſpected,
that, by this nomination, the chancellor had intended to diſcredit the common
law. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were made to the council; who, influenced by the protector,
gladly laid hold of this opportunity to depreſs Southampton. They conſulted
the judges with regard to ſo unuſual a caſe, and received for anſwer,
that the commiſſion was illegal, and that the chancellor, by his
preſumption in granting it, had juſtly forfeited the ſeals, and was even
liable to puniſhment. The council ſummoned him to appear before them; and
tho' he maintained, that he held his office by the late King's will, founded on
an act of parliament, and could not loſe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a trial before the
Parliament; that if the commiſſion, which he had granted, was found
illegal, it might be declared null and void, and all the ill conſequences of
it be eaſily remedied; and that the depriving him of the ſeals for an error
of this nature, was a precedent by which any other innovation might be
authorized; the council, notwithſtanding all theſe topics of defence,
declared that he had forfeited his office; that a fine ſhould be impoſed
upon him; and that he ſhould be confined to his own houſe during
pleaſure<note n="†" place="bottom">Hollingſhed, p. 979.</note>.</p>
               <p>THO' the removal of Southampton encreaſed the protector's
authority, and tended to ſuppreſs factions in the regency; yet was not
Somerſet contented with this advantage: His ambition carried him to ſeek
ſtill farther acquiſitions. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence, that the vote of the
executors, chooſing him protector, was not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient 
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0429000101:296"/> foundation for his authority, he procured a patent from
the young King, by which he entirely overturned the will of Harry the eighth,
produced a total revolution in the government, and may ſeem even to have
ſubverted all the laws of the kingdom. 
<note place="margin">12 March.</note> He named himſelf protector
with full regal power, and appointed a council, conſiſting of all the
former counſellors, and all the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors except Southampton: He reſerved
a power of naming any other counſellors at pleaſure: And he was bound to
conſult with ſuch only as he thought proper. The protector and his council
were likewiſe empowered to act at diſcretion, and to execute whatever they
thought ſerviceable to the government, without incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any penalty or
forfeiture from any law, ſtatute, proclamation, or ordinance
whatſoever<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. ii. Records, No. 6.</note>.
Even had this patent been leſs exorbitant in its conceſſions, and had it
been drawn by directions from the executors appointed by Henry, its le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
might juſtly be queſtioned; ſince it ſeems eſſential to a truſt
of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be exerciſed by the perſons entruſted, nor can it be
delegated to others: But as the patent, by its very tenor, where the executors
are not ſo much as mentioned, appears to have been ſurreptitiouſly
obtained from a minor King, the protectorſhip of Somerſet was a plain
uſurpation, which it is impoſſible by any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to juſtify. The
connivance, however, of the executors, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent acquieſcence in
the new eſtabliſhment, made it be univerſally ſubmitted to; and as the
young King diſcovered an extreme attachment to his uncle, who was alſo in
the main a man of moderation and probity, no objections were made to his power
and title. All men of ſenſe, likewiſe, as they ſaw the nation divided
by the religious zeal of the oppoſite ſects, thought it the more
neceſſary to entruſt the government to one perſon, who might check the
exorbitancies of party, and enſure the public tranquillity. And tho' ſome
clauſes of the patent ſeemed to imply a formal ſubverſion of all
liberty or limited government, ſo little jealouſy was then uſually
entertained on that head, that no exception was ever taken at bare claims or
pretenſions of this nature, advanced by any perſon, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of
ſovereign power. The actual exerciſe alone of arbitrary adminiſtration,
and that in many and great and flagrant and unpopular inſtances, was able
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to give ſome umbrage to the nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reformation compleated.</note> THE
extenſive authority and imperious character of Henry, had retained the
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans of both religions in ſubjection; but upon his deceaſe, the hopes
of the proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants and the fears of the catholics began to revive, and the
zeal of theſe parties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced every where diſputes and animoſities, the
uſual preludes of more fatal diviſions. The protector had long been
regarded as the ſecret partizan of the reformers; and being now freed from
reſtraint, he ſcrupled not to expreſs his intention of 
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0429000101:297"/> correcting all the abuſes of the antient religion, and
of adopting ſtill more of the proteſtant innovations. He took care, that
all the perſons, to whom he entruſted the King's education, ſhould be
attached to the ſame principles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as the young Prince diſcovered a
zeal for every kind of literature, eſpecially the theological, far beyond his
tender years, all men foreſaw, in the courſe of his reign, the total
abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the catholic faith; and they early began to declare themſelves
in favour of thoſe tenets, which were likely to become in the end entirely
prevalent. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Southampton's fall, few members of the council ſeemed to
retain any attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Romiſh communion; and moſt of the
counſellors appeared even ſanguine in forwarding the progreſs of the
reformation. The riches which moſt of them had acquired from the ſpoils of
the clergy, induced them to widen the breach between England and Rome; and by
eſtabliſhing a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſpeculative tenets, as well as of
diſcipline and worſhip, to render a coali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the mother church
altogether impracticable<note n="*" place="bottom">Goodwin's Annals,
Heylin.</note>. Their rapacity alſo, the chief ſource of their reforming
ſpirit, was excited by the proſpect of pillaging the ſecular, as they had
already done the regular clergy; and they knew, that, while any ſhare of the
old principles remained, or any regard to the eccleſiaſtics, they never
could hope to ſucceed in their pretenſions.</p>
               <p>THE numerous and burthenſome ſuperſtitions, with which the
Romiſh church was loaded, had thrown many of the reformers, by the ſpirit
of oppoſition, into an enthuſiaſtic ſtrain of devotion; and all rites,
ceremonies, pomp, order, and exterior obſervances were zealouſly
aboliſhed by them, as hindrances of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual contemplation, and
obſtructions to their immediate converſe with heaven. Many circumſtances
concurred to enflame this daring ſpirit; the novelty itſelf of their
doctrines, the triumph of making proſelytes, the furious perſecutions to
which they were expoſed, their animoſity againſt the antient tenets and
practices, and the neceſſity of procuring the concurrence of the laity, by
depreſſing the hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy, and by tendering to them the plunder of the
eccleſiaſtics. Wherever the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation prevailed over the oppoſition of
civil authority, this genius of religion appeared in its full extent, and was
attended with conſequences, which, tho' leſs durable, were, for ſome
time, no leſs dangerous than thoſe which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the antient
ſuperſtition. But as the magiſtrate took the lead in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the
tranſition was more gradual; much of the antient religion was ſtill
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and a reaſonable degree of ſubordination was retained in
diſcipline, as well as ſome pomp, order, and ceremony in public
worſhip.</p>
               <p>THE protector, in his ſchemes for advancing the reformation,
had always recourſe to the councils of Cranmer, who, being a man of
moderation and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0429000101:298"/> was averſe to all violent
changes, and was determined to bring over the people, by inſenſible
innovations, to that ſyſtem of doctrine and diſcipline, which he
eſteemed the moſt pure and perfect. He probably alſo foreſaw, that a
ſyſtem, which carefully avoided the extremes of reformation, was likely to
be moſt laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that a devotion, merely ſpiritual, was fitted only
for the firſt fervours of a new ſect, and upon the relaxation of theſe
naturally gave place to the inroads of ſuperſtition. He ſeems therefore
to have intended the eſtabliſhment of a hierarchy, which, being ſuited to
a great and ſettled government, might ſtand as a perpetual barrier
againſt Rome, and might retain the reverence of the people, even after their
enthuſiaſtic zeal was diminiſhed or entirely evaporated.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Gardiner's oppoſition.</note> THE perſon,
who oppoſed, with greateſt authority, any farther advances towards
reformation, was Gardiner, biſhop of Wincheſter; who, tho' he had not
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a place in the counſel of regency, on account of ſome late
diſguſts, which he had given to Henry, was entitled, by his age,
experience, and capacity, to the higheſt truſt and confidence of his party.
This prelate continued ſtill to magnify the great wiſdom and learning of
the late King, which were generally and ſincerely admired by the nation; and
he inſiſted on the prudence of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, at leaſt till the young
King's majority, in the eccleſiaſtical model, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by that
great monarch. He defended the uſe of images, which were now very openly
attacked by the proteſtants; and he repreſented them as ſerviceable in
maintaining a ſenſe of religion among the illiterate multitude<note n="*" place="bottom">Fox, vol. ii. p. 712.</note>. He even deigned to write an apology
for <hi>holy water,</hi> which biſhop Ridley had decried in a ſermon; and
he maintained, that, by the power of the Almighty, it might be rendered an
inſtrument of doing good; as much as the ſhadow of St. Peter, the hem of
our Saviour's garment, or the ſpittle and clay laid upon the eyes of the
blind<note n="†" place="bottom">Fox, vol. ii. p. 724.</note>. Above all,
he inſiſted, that the laws ought to be obſerved, that the conſtitution
ought to be preſerved inviolate, and that it was dangerous to follow the will
of the ſovereign, in oppoſition to an act of parliament<note n="‡" place="bottom">Collier, vol. ii. p. 228. Fox, vol. ii.</note>.</p>
               <p>BUT tho' there remained at that time in England an idea of laws
and a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, ſufficient at leaſt to furniſh a topic of argument
to ſuch as were diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the preſent exerciſe of authority;
this plea could ſcarcely, in the preſent caſe, be maintained with any
plauſibility by Gardiner. An act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had inveſted the crown with
a legiſlative power; and royal proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even during a minority, were
armed with the force and authority of laws. The protector, finding himſelf
ſupported by this ſtatute, was determined to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his influence in
favour of the reformers; and having ſuſpended, during the interval, the
authority of the biſhops, he appointed a general viſitation to be 
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0429000101:299"/> made in all the dioceſes of England<note n="*" place="bottom">Mem. Cranm. p. 146, 147, &amp;c.</note>. The viſitors
conſiſted of a mixture of clergy and laity, and had ſix circuits
aſſigned them. The chief purpoſe of their inſtructions was, beſides
correcting immoralities and irregularities in the clergy, to aboliſh the
antient ſuperſtitions, and to bring the diſcipline and worſhip
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what nearer the practice of the reformed churches. The moderation of
Somerſet and Cranmer is apparent in the conduct of this delicate affair. The
viſitors were enjoined to retain for the preſent all images which had not
been abuſed to idolatry; and to inſtruct the people not to deſpiſe
ſuch ceremonies as were not yet abrogated, but only to beware of ſome
particular ſuperſtitions, ſuch as the ſprinkling their beds with holy
water, the ringing of bells, or uſing of bleſſed candles, in order to
drive away the devil<note n="†" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. ii. p.
28.</note>.</p>
               <p>BUT nothing required more the correcting hand of authority, than
the abuſe of preaching, which was now generally employed, throughout England,
in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the antient practices and ſuperſtitions. The court of
augmentations, in order to eaſe the King of the annuities paid to monks, had
commonly placed them in the vacant churches; and theſe men were led by
intereſt, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, to ſupport thoſe principles, which had
been invented for the profit of the clergy. Orders therefore were given to
reſtrain the topics of their ſermons: Twelve homilies were publiſhed,
which they were enjoined to read to the people: And all of them were
prohibited, without expreſs permiſſion, to preach any where but in their
pariſh churches. The deſign of this injunction was to throw a reſtraint
on the catholic divines; while the proteſtant, by the grant of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
licences, ſhould be allowed unbounded liberty.</p>
               <p>BONNER made ſome oppoſition to theſe meaſures; but
ſoon after retracted and acquieſced. Gardiner was more high-ſpirited and
more ſteddy. He repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the peril of perpetual innovations, and the
neceſſity of adhering to ſome ſyſtem. 
<q rend="inline">"'Tis a dangerous thing," ſaid he, "to uſe
too much freedom, in reſearches of this kind. If you cut the old canal, the
water is apt to run fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than you have a mind to. If you indulge the humour
of novelty, you cannot put a ſtop to people's demands, nor govern their
indiſcretions at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For my part," ſaid he, on another occaſion,
"my ſole concern is to manage the third and laſt act of my life with
decency, and to make a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome exit off the ſtage. Provided this point is
ſecured, I am not ſollicitous about the reſt. I am already by nature
condemned to death: No man can give me a pardon from this ſentence; nor ſo
much as procure me a reprieve. To ſpeak my mind, and to act as my
conſcience directs, are two branches of liberty, which I can never part with.
Sincerity in ſpeech, and integrity in <pb n="295" facs="tcp:0429000101:300"/> action, are
entertaining qualities: They will ſtick by a man, when every thing elſe
takes its leave; and I muſt not reſign them upon any conſideration. The
beſt on it is, if I do not throw them away myſelf, no man can force them
from me: But if I give them up, then am I ruined by myſelf, and deſerve to
loſe all my preferments<note n="*" place="bottom">Collier, vol. II. p. 228. ex
MS. Col. C. C. Cantab. Bibliothica Brittanica, article Gardiner.</note>.</q>
This oppoſition of Gardiner drew on him the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the council; and
he was ſent to the Fleet, where he was uſed with ſome harſhneſs and
ſeverity.</p>
               <p>ONE of the chief objections, urged by Gardiner againſt the new
homilies, was that they defined with the moſt metaphyſical preciſion the
doctrine of grace, and of juſtification by faith; points, he thought, which
it was ſuperfluous for any man to know exactly, and which certainly exceeded
much the comprehenſion of the vulgar. A famous martyrologiſt calls
Gardiner, on account of this opinion, 
<q rend="inline">"an inſenſible aſs, and one that had no
feeling of God's ſpirit in the matter of juſtification<note n="†" place="bottom">Fox, vol. II.</note>."</q> The meaneſt proteſtant imagined at
that time, that he had a full comprehenſion of all thoſe myſterious
doctrines, and he heartily deſpiſed the moſt learned and knowing perſon
of the antient religion. It is indeed certain, that the reformers were very
fortunate in their doctrine of juſtification, and might venture to promiſe
on its ſucceſs, in oppoſition to all the ceremonies, ſhows, and
ſuperſtitions of popery. By exalting Chriſt and his ſufferings, and
renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all claim to independent merit in ourſelves, it was calculated to
become po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, and coincided with thoſe principles of panegyric and of
ſelf-abaſement, which generally have place in religion.</p>
               <p>TONSTAL, biſhop of Durham, having, as well as Gardiner, made
ſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the new regulations, was diſmiſſed the
council-board; but no farther ſeverity was, for the preſent, exerciſed
againſt him. He was a man of perfect moderation, and of the moſt
unexceptionable character in the kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Foreign af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</note> THE ſame religious
zeal which engaged Somerſet to promote the reformation at home, led him to
carry his attention to foreign countries; where the intereſts of the
proteſtants were now expoſed to the moſt imminent danger. The Roman
pontiff, with much reluctance and after long delays, had at laſt ſummoned a
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral council, which was aſſembled at Trent, and was employed in
correcting the abuſes of the church, and in aſcertaining her doctrines. The
emperor, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to repreſs the power of the court of Rome, as well as
gain over the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, promoted the former object of the council; the
pope, who found his own greatneſs ſo deeply intereſted, deſired rather
to employ them in the latter. He <pb n="296" facs="tcp:0429000101:301"/> gave inſtructions to
his legates, who preſided in the council, to protract the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and to
engage the theologians in altercations, and arguments, and diſputes
concerning the nice points of faith, canvaſſed before them: A policy, which
was ſo eaſy to be executed, that the legates found it rather neceſſary
to interpoſe, in order to appeaſe the animoſity of the divines, and bring
them at laſt to ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion<note n="‡" place="bottom">Father
Paul, lib. 2.</note>. The more difficult taſk for the legates was to moderate
or divert the zeal of the council for reformation, and to repreſs the
ambition of the prelates, who deſired to exalt the epiſcopal authority on
the ruins of the ſovereign pontiff. Finding this humour become intractable,
the legates, under pretence that the plague had broke out at Trent, transferred
of a ſudden the council to Bologna, where, they hoped, it would be more under
the direction of his holineſs.</p>
               <p>THE emperor, no leſs than the pope, had learned to make
religion ſubſervient to his ambition and policy. He was reſolved to
employ the imputation of hereſy as a pretence for ſubduing the proteſtant
princes, and oppreſſing the liberties of Germany; but found it requiſite
to cover his intentions under a deep artifice, and to prevent the combination
of his adverſaries. He ſeparated the Palatine and the elector of
Brandenburgh from the proteſtant confederacy: He took arms againſt the
elector of Saxony, and the landgrave of Heſſe: By the fortune of war he
made the former priſoner: He employed treachery and prevarication againſt
the latter, and detained him captive, by breaking a ſafe-conduct which he had
granted him. He ſeemed to have reached the ſummit of his ambition; and the
German princes, who were aſtoniſhed with his ſucceſs, were farther
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the intelligence, which they had received, of the death
firſt of Henry the eighth, then of Francis the firſt, their uſual
reſources in every ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity<note n="*" place="bottom">Sleidan.</note>.</p>
               <p>HENRY the ſecond, who ſucceeded to the crown of France, was
a prince of vigour and ability; but leſs prompt in his reſolutions than
Francis, and leſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with rivalſhip and animoſity againſt the
emperor, Charles. Tho' he ſent ambaſſadors to the princes of the

Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> THE hatred between the two factions, the partizans of the
antient and thoſe of the new religion, became every day more violent in
Scotland; and the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, which the cardinal primate had taken to employ
the moſt rigorous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt the reformers, brought matters to
a quick deciſion. There was one Wiſhart, a gentleman by birth, who employed
himſelf with great zeal in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the antient
ſuperſtitions, and began to give alarm to the clergy, who were juſtly
terrified with the danger of ſome fatal revolution in religion. This man was
much celebrated for the purity of his morals, and for his extenſive learning:
But theſe praiſes cannot be much depended on; becauſe, we know, that,
among the reformers, ſeverity of manners ſtood in place of many virtues;
and the age was in general ſo ignorant, that moſt of the prieſts in
Scotland imagined the New Teſtament to be a compoſition of Luther's, and
aſſerted that the Old alone was the word of God<note n="*" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 75. The ſame author, p. 92, tells us a ſtory,
which confirms this character of the popiſh clergy in Scotland. It became a
great diſpute in the univerſity of St. Andrews, whether the <hi>pater</hi>
ſhould be ſaid to God or the ſaints. The friars, who knew in general that
the reformers neglected the ſaints, were determined to maintain their honour
with great obſtinacy, but they knew not upon what topics to found their
doctrine. Some held that the <hi>pater</hi> was ſaid to God
<hi>formaliter,</hi> and to ſaints <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiter;</hi> others, to God
<hi>principaliter,</hi> and to ſaints <hi>minus principaliter;</hi> others
would have it <hi>ultimate</hi> and <hi>non ultimate:</hi> But the majority
ſeemed to hold, that the <hi>pater</hi> was ſaid to God <hi>capiendo
ſtricte,</hi> and to ſaints <hi>capiendo large.</hi> A ſimple fellow, who
ſerved the ſub-prior, thinking there was ſome great matter in hand, that
made the doctors hold ſo many conferences together, aſked him one day what
the matter was; the ſub-prior anſwering, <hi>Tom,</hi> that was the
fellow's name, <hi>we cannot agree to whom the pater-noſter ſhould be

<hi>that he had given a wiſer deciſion than all the doctors had done with
all their diſtinctions.</hi>
                  </note>. But however the caſe may have been
with regard to thoſe eſtimable qualities aſcribed to Wiſhart, he was
ſtrongly poſſeſſed with a deſire of innovation; and he enjoyed
thoſe talents, which qualified him for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a popular preacher, and for
ſeizing the attention and affections of the multitude. The magiſtrates of
Dundee, where he exerciſed his miſſion, were alarmed with his progreſs;
and being unable or unwilling to treat him with rigour, they contented
themſelves with denying him the liberty of preaching, and with
diſmiſſing him the bounds of their juriſdiction. Wiſhart, moved with
indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that they had dared to reject the word of God, menaced them, in
imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the antient prophets, with ſome imminent calamity; and he
withdrew to the weſt country, where he daily increaſed the number of his
proſelytes. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, a plague broke out in Dundee; and all men exclaimed,
that the town had drawn down the vengeance of Heaven by baniſhing the pious
preacher, and that the peſtilence would never ceaſe till they had made him
attonement for their <pb n="298" facs="tcp:0429000101:303"/> offence againſt him. No ſooner
did Wiſhart hear of this change in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, than he returned
to them, and made them a new tender of his doctrine: But leſt he ſhould
ſpread the contagion by bringing multitudes together, he erected his pulpit
on the top of a gate: The infected ſtood within; the others without. And the

               <p>THE aſſiduity and ſucceſs of Wiſhart became an object
of attention to cardinal Beaton; and he reſolved, by the puniſhment of ſo
celebrated a preacher, to ſtrike a terror into all other innovators. He
engaged the earl of Bothwel to arreſt him in his retirement; and to deliver
him into his hands, contrary to a promiſe given by Bothwel to that unhappy
man: And being poſſeſſed of his prey, he conducted him to St. Andrew's
where, after a trial, he condemned him to the flames for hereſy. Arran, the
regent, was very irreſolute in his temper; and the cardinal, tho' he had
gained him to his party, found, that he would not concur in the condemnation
and execution of Wiſhart. He was therefore determined, without the
aſſiſtance of the ſecular arm, to bring that heretic to puniſhment;
and he himſelf beheld from his windows the diſmal ſpectacle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Wiſhart ſuffered with the uſual patience; but could not forbear remarking
the triumph of his inſulting enemy. He foretold, that in a few days he would
in the very ſame place lie as low, as now he was exalted aloft, in
oppoſition to true piety and religion<note n="‡" place="bottom">Spotſwood, Buchanan.</note>.</p>
               <p>THIS propheſy was probably the immediate cauſe of the event

formed a conſpiracy againſt the cardinal; and having aſſociated to them
Norman Leſly, who was diſguſted on account of ſome private quarrel,
they conducted their enterprize with great ſecrecy and ſucceſs. Early in
the morning they entered the cardinal's palace, which he had ſtrongly
fortified; and though they were not above ſixteen perſons, they thruſt
out an hundred tradeſmen and fifty ſervants, whom they ſeized
ſeparately, before any ſuſpicion aroſe of their intentions; and having
ſhut the gates, they proceeded very deliberately to execute their purpoſe
on the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal. That prelate had been alarmed with the noiſe which he heard
in the caſtle; and had barricadoe'd the door of his chamber: But finding that
they had brought fire in order to force their way, and having obtained, as is
believed, a promiſe of life, he opened the door; and reminding them, that he
was a prieſt, be conjured them to ſpare him. Two of the aſſaſſins
ruſhed upon him with drawn ſwords; but a third, James Melvil, more calm and
more conſiderate in <pb n="299" facs="tcp:0429000101:304"/> villany, ſtopped their carreer,
and reminded them, that this ſacrifice was the work and judgment of God, and
ought to be executed with the utmoſt reflection and gravity. Then turning the
point of his ſword towards Beaton, he called to him, 
<q rend="inline">"Repent thee, thou wicked cardinal, of all thy
ſins and iniquities, but eſpecially of the murder of Wiſhart, that
inſtrument of God for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of theſe lands: It is his death,
which now cries vengeance upon thee: We are ſent by God to inflict the
deſerved puniſhment. For here, before the Almighty, I proteſt, that it is
neither hatred of thy perſon, nor love of thy riches, nor fear of thy power,
which moves me to ſeek thy death: But only becauſe thou haſt been, and
ſtill remaineſt, an obſtinate enemy to Chriſt Jeſus, and his holy
goſpel."</q> Having ſpoke theſe words, without giving him leiſure to
finiſh that repentance, to which he exhorted him, he thruſt him thro' the

the 28th of May 1546. The aſſaſſins being reinforced by their friends
to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of an hundred and forty perſons, prepared themſelves for the
defence of the caſtle, and ſent a meſſenger to London, craving
aſſiſtance from Henry. That prince, tho' Scotland was comprehended in his
peace with France, would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject this opportunity of diſturbing the
government of that kingdom; and he agreed to take them under his
protection.</p>
               <p>IT was the peculiar misfortune of Scotland, that five ſhort
reigns had been ſucceſſively followed by as many long minorities; and the
execution of juſtice, which the prince was beginning to introduce, had been
continually interrupted by the cabals, factions, and animoſities of the
great. But beſides theſe invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and antient evils, a new ſource of
diſorder had ariſen, the diſputes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of theology, which
were ſufficient to diſturb the moſt ſettled govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the death
of the cardinal, who was poſſeſſed of ability and vigour, ſeemed much
to weaken the hands of the adminiſtration. But the Queen dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager was a woman
of uncommon talents and virtues; and ſhe did as much to ſupport the
government, and ſupply the weakneſs of Arran, the governor, as could be
expected in her ſituation. A ſtipulation was made with the garriſon of
St. Andrews, that they ſhould ſurrender the caſtle upon receiving a
pardon, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with an abſolution from the pope; and that they ſhould
never afterwards <pb n="300" facs="tcp:0429000101:305"/> be called in queſtion for Beaton's
aſſaſſination. Meanwhile, till the pope's abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution ſhould
arrive, ſhe applied to France for ſuccours; and Henry ſent her ſome
gallies, with a train of artillery, commanded by Strozzi, prior of Capua.
Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſiege of St. Andrews was opened, the abſolution was ſent to
the garriſon, and they were required to ſurrender; but becauſe the pope,
among other exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the cardinal's murder, had ſaid, that he
pardoned an unpardonable crime, the garriſon, fearing that this
expreſſion was employed in order to enſnare them, refuſed to open their
gates<note n="†" place="bottom">Knox, p. 75. Spotſwood,

                  <note place="margin">Conduct of the war with Scotland.</note> THE
protector of England, ſo ſoon as the government was brought to ſome
compoſure, made preparations for the attack of Scotland; and he was
determined to execute, if poſſible, that project, of uniting the two
kingdoms by marriage, on which the late King had been ſo intent, and which he
had recommended with his dying breath to his executors. He raiſed an army of
18000 men, and equipped a fleet of ſixty ſail, one half of which were
ſhips of war, the other loaded with proviſions and ammunition. He gave the
command of the fleet to lord Clinton: He himſelf marched at the head of the
army, attended by the earl of Warwic. Theſe hoſtile meaſures were covered
with a pretence of revenging ſome depredations committed by the borderers;
but beſides, that the protector revived the antient claim of the
ſuperiority of the Engliſh crown over that of Scotland, he refuſed to
enter into negotiation on any other conditions than the marriage of the young
Queen with Edward.</p>
               <p>THE protector publiſhed a manifeſto, in which he inforced
all the arguments for that meaſure. He ſaid, that nature ſeemed
originally to have intended this iſland for one empire; and having cut it off
from all communication with foreign ſtates, and guarded it by the ocean,
ſhe had pointed out to the inhabitants the road to happineſs and
ſecurity: That the education and cuſtoms of the people concurred with
nature; and by giving them the ſame language, and laws, and manners, had
invited them to a thorough union and coalition: That fortune had at laſt
removed all obſtacles, and had prepared an expedient, by which they might
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one people, without leaving any place for that jealouſy either of
honour or of intereſt, to which rival nations are naturally ſo much
expoſed: That the crown of Scotland had devolved to a female; that of England
to a male; and happily the two ſovereigns, as of a rank, ſo were they
alſo of an age, the moſt ſuitable <pb n="301" facs="tcp:0429000101:306"/> to each other:
That the hoſtile diſpoſition, which prevailed between the nations, and
which aroſe from paſt injuries, would ſoon be extinguiſhed, after a
long and ſecure peace had eſtabliſhed confidence between them: That the
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of former miſeries, which at preſent enflamed their mutual
animoſity, would then ſerve only to make them cheriſh, with more
paſſion, a ſtate of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and tranquillity, ſo long unknown to
their anceſtors: That when hoſtilities had ceaſed between the kingdoms,
the Scotch nobility, who were at preſent obliged to remain perpetually in a
warlike poſture, would learn to cultivate the arts of peace, and would
ſoften their minds to a love of domeſtic order and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: That as this
ſituation was deſirable to both kingdoms, ſo particularly to Scotland,
which had been expoſed to the greateſt miſeries from inteſtine and
fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign wars, and ſaw herſelf every moment in danger of loſing her
independency, by the efforts of a richer and more powerful people: That tho'
England had claims of ſuperiority, ſhe was willing to reſign every
pretenſion for the ſake of future peace, and deſired an union, which
would be the more ſecure, as it would be concluded on terms entirely equal:
And that beſides all theſe motives, poſitive engagements had been taken
for the compleating this alliance, and the honour and good faith of the nation
were pledged to fulfil what her intereſt and ſafety ſo loudly
demanded<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir John Hayward in Kenneth, p. 279. Heylin,
p. 42.</note>.</p>
               <p>SOMERSET ſoon found, that theſe remonſtrances would have
no influence; and that the Queen dowager's attachments to France and to the
catholic religion would render ineffectual all negotiations for the intended
marriage. He found himſelf therefore obliged to try the force of arms, and to
conſtrain the Scotch by neceſſity to ſubmit to a meaſure, for which
they ſeemed to have entertained the moſt incurable averſion. 
<note place="margin">2d September.</note> He paſſed the borders
at Berwic, and advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Edinburgh, without meeting any reſiſtance
for ſome days, except from ſome ſmall caſtles, which were conſtrained
to ſurrender at diſcretion. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector intended to have puniſhed the
governor and garriſon of one of thoſe caſtles for their temerity in
reſiſting ſuch unequal force: But they eluded his anger by aſking only
a few hours reſpite till they ſhould prepare themſelves for death; after
which they found his ears more open to their applications for mercy<note n="†" place="bottom">Hayward, Patten.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE governor of Scotland had ſummoned together the whole force
of the kingdom; and his army, double the number of the Engliſh, had taken
poſt on very advantageous ground, guarded by the banks of the Eſke, about
four miles from Edinburgh. The Engliſh came within ſight of them at
Faſide; and after a ſkirmiſh between the horſe, where the Scotch were
worſted, and lord Hume dangerouſly wounded, Somerſet prepared himſelf
for a more deciſive action. But <pb n="302" facs="tcp:0429000101:307"/> having taken a view of
the Scotch camp with the earl of Warwic, he found it difficult to make any
attempt upon it with a probability of ſucceſs. He wrote therefore another
letter to Arran; and offered to retire out of the kingdom, as well as to repair
all damages which he had committed, provided that the Scotch would ſtipulate
not to contract the Queen to any foreign prince, but to keep her at home, till
ſhe reached the age of chooſing a huſband for herſelf. Such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
terms were rejected by the Scotch merely on account of their moderation; and
begot an opinion, that the protector muſt either be reduced to great
diſtreſs or be influenced by fear, that he was now contented to abate ſo
much of his former pretenſions. Actuated alſo by their prieſts, who had
come to the camp in great numbers, they believed, that the Engliſh were
deteſtable heretics, abhorred of God, and expoſed to divine vengeance; and
that no ſucceſs could ever crown their arms. They were confirmed in this
fond conceit, when they ſaw the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector change his ground, and move
towards the ſea; nor did they any longer doubt that he intended to embark his
army, and make his eſcape on board the ſhips, which at that very time moved
into the bay, oppoſite to him<note n="*" place="bottom">Hollingſhed, p.
985.</note>. Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined therefore to cut off his retreat, they quitted their
camp; 
<note place="margin">10th Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> and paſſing the
river Eſke, advanced into the plain. They were divided into three bodies:
Angus commanded the vanguard; Arran the main body; Huntley the rear: Their
cavalry conſiſted only of light horſe, which were placed on their left
flank, ſtrengthened by ſome Iriſh archers, whom Argyle had brought over
for this ſervice.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The battle of Pinkey.</note> SOMERSET was
pleaſed when he ſaw this movement of the Scotch army; and as the Engliſh
had uſually been ſuperior in pitched battles, he conceived great hopes of
ſucceſs. He arranged his van on his left, fartheſt from the ſea; and
ordered them to remain on the high grounds on which he placed them, till the
enemy ſhould approach: He placed his main battle and his rear towards the
right; and beyond the van he poſted lord Gray at the head of the men at arms,
and ordered him to take the Scotch van in ſlank, but not till they ſhould
be engaged in cloſe fight with the van of the Engliſh.</p>
               <p>WHILE the Scotch were advancing on the plain, they were galled
with the artillery from the Engliſh ſhips: The maſter of Graham was
killed: The Iriſh archers were thrown into diſorder: and even the other
troops began to ſtagger: When the lord Gray, perceiving their ſituation,
neglected his orders, left his ground, and at the head of his heavy-armed
horſe made an attack on the Scotch infantry, in hopes of gaining all the
honour of the victory. On advancing, he <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0429000101:308"/> found a ſlough
and ditch in his way; and behind were ranged the Scotch infantry armed with
ſpears, and the field, on which they ſtood, was fallow ground, broken with
ridges, which lay croſs their front, and diſordered the movements of the
Engliſh cavalry. From all theſe accidents, the ſhock of this body of
horſe was feeble and irregular; and as they were received on the points of
the Scottiſh ſpears, which were longer than the lances of the Engliſh
horſemen, they were in a moment pierced, overthrown, and diſcomfited. Gray
himſelf was dangerouſly wounded: Lord Edward Seymour, ſon to the
protector, loſt his horſe: The ſtandard was near being taken: And had the
Scotch poſſeſſed any good body of cavalry, who might have purſued the
advantage, the whole Engliſh army had been expoſed to great danger<note n="*" place="bottom">Patten, Hollingſhed, p. 986.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE protector mean-while, aſſiſted by Sir Ralph Sadler and
Sir Ralph Vane, employed himſelf with diligence and ſucceſs, in rallying
the cavalry. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wic ſhowed great preſence of mind in maintaining the ranks
of the foot, on which the horſe had recoiled: He made Sir Peter Meutas
advance, captain of the foot hackbutters, and Sir Peter Gamboa, captain of
ſome Italian and Spaniſh hackbutters, on horſeback; and ordered them to
ply the Scotch infantry with their ſhot. They marched to the ſlough, and
diſcharged their pieces full in the face of the enemy: The ſhips galled
them from the flank: The artillery, planted on a height, infeſted them from
the front: The Engliſh archers poured in a ſhower of arrows upon them: And
the vanguard, deſcending from the hill, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, leiſurely and orderly,
towards them. Diſmayed with all theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the Scotch van
began to retreat: The retreat ſoon changed into a flight; which was begun by
the Iriſh archers. The panic of the van communicated itſelf to the main
body, and paſſing thence to the rear, rendered the whole field a ſcene of
confuſion, terror, flight and conſternation. The Engliſh army per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the heights the condition of the Scotch, and began the purſuit with loud
ſhouts and acclamations, which added ſtill more to the diſmay of the
van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed. The horſe in particular, eager to revenge the affront, which
they had received in the beginning of the day, committed the moſt bloody
execution on the flying enemy; and from the field of battle to Edinburgh, for
the ſpace of five miles, the whole ground was ſtrowed with dead bodies. The
prieſts above all, and the monks received no quarter; and the Engliſh made
ſport of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering men, who, from their extreme zeal and animoſity,
had engaged in an enterprize ſo ill ſuited to their profeſſion. Few
victories have been more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive, or gained with ſmaller loſs to the
conquerors. There fell not two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the Engliſh; and according to the
moſt moderate computation, there <pb n="304" facs="tcp:0429000101:309"/> periſhed above ten
thouſand of the Scotch. About fifteen hundred were taken priſoners. This
action was called the Battle of Pinkey, from a nobleman's ſeat of that name
in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>THE Queen dowager and Arran fled to Stirling, and were ſcarce
able to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſuch a body of forces as could check the incurſions of
ſmall parties of the Engliſh. About the ſame time, the earl of Lenox and
lord Wharton entered the Weſt Marches, at the head of five thouſand men,
and after taking and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Annan, they ſpread devaſtation over all
the neighbouring counties<note n="*" place="bottom">Hollingſhed, p.

what terms he pleaſed on the Scotch nation: But he was impatient to return to
England, where he heard, ſome counſellors, and even his own brother, the
admiral, were carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on cabals againſt his authority. Having taken the

               <p>A REPEAL alſo paſſed of that law, the deſtruction of all
laws, by which the King's proclamation was made of equal force with a
ſtatute<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Edw. VI. c.

likewiſe mitigated, by which the King was empowered to annul all laws
paſſed before the four and twentieth year of his age: He could prevent
their future execution; but could not recall any paſt effects, which had
enſued from them<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>
               <p>SOME ſtatutes too were paſſed which were of the utmoſt
importance, becauſe they promoted the principles and practices of the
reformers, tho' they may not, all of them, appear to be attended with any
material conſequences to civil ſociety. The cup was reſtored to the
laity; private maſſes were aboliſhed; the King was empowered to create
biſhops by letters patent, without any ſham elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the chapter; the
biſhops were ordered to iſſue their writs, and hold their courts in the
King's name<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>; vagabonds were adjudged to be

               <p>THE chantries and free chappels had been given by act of

poſſeſſion of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues; but as they had not proceeded far in the
execution of their office, it was found neceſſary to make a renewal of the
grant. The preamble to the ſtatute promiſes, that theſe funds ſhould be
employed to good and godly uſes, in erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grammar ſchools, in farther
augmenting the univerſities, and in making better proviſion for the poor

courtiers had already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the prey in their imaginations; and it was not
long before it was ſhared out among them.</p>
               <p>IT was alſo enacted, that all who denied the King's
ſupremacy, or aſſerted the pope's, ſhould, for the firſt offence,
forfeit their goods and chattels, and ſuffer impriſonment during
pleaſure; for the ſecond offence, ſhould incur the pain of
<hi>praemunire;</hi> and for the third offence be attainted of treaſon. But
if any, after the firſt of March next, endeavoured, by writing, printing, or
any overt act or deed, to deprive the King of his eſtate or titles,
particularly of his ſupremacy, or to confer them on any other, he was to be
adjudged guilty of treaſon. If any of the heirs of the crown ſhould uſurp
upon another, or endeavour to break the <pb n="306" facs="tcp:0429000101:311"/> order of
ſucceſſion, it was declared treaſon in them, their aiders and abetters.
Theſe were the moſt conſiderable acts paſſed during this
ſeſſion. The members diſcovered a very paſſive diſpoſition with
regard to religion: Some few appeared zealous for the reformation: Others
harboured ſecretly a ſtrong inclination to the catholic faith: But the
greateſt part appeared willing to take any impreſſion which they ſhould
receive from intereſt, authority, or the reigning faſhion<note n="‡" place="bottom">Heylin. p 48.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE convocation met at the ſame time with the Parliament; and
as it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that their debates were at firſt cramped by the rigour of
the ſtatute of the ſix articles, the King granted them a diſpenſation
from that law, before it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed by Parliament<note n="‖" place="bottom">Antiq. Britan. p. 339.</note>. The lower houſe of convocation
applied to have liberty of ſitting with the commons in Parliament; or if this
privilege was refuſed them, which they claimed as their ancient right, they
deſired that no law regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing religion, might paſs in Parliament without
their conſent and approbation. But the principles which now prevailed, were
more advantageous to the civil than the eccleſiaſtical power; and tho'
there is reaſon to think, that the lower clergy ſent, during ſome time,
repreſentatives to the houſe of commons<note n="*" place="bottom">See
Atterbury's Rights, &amp;c. of an Engliſh convocation, p. 73.</note>; yet
that practice had been aboliſhed for above two centuries; and the preſent
juncture was very little favourable for attempting to revive it.</p>

the repeal of that law, which gave to the King's proclamations the authority of
ſtatutes; but he did not intend to renounce that arbitrary or diſcretionary
exerciſe of power, which had ever been aſſumed by the crown, and which it
is difficult to diſtinguiſh exactly from the power of making laws. He even
continued to exert this authority in ſome particulars, which were regarded as
the moſt momentuous.

Orders were iſſued by council, that candles ſhould no longer be carried

ceremonies, which belonged to the ancient religion<note n="‡" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. II.</note>.</p>
               <p>AN order was alſo iſſued by the council for the removal of
all images from the churches: An innovation which was much deſired by all the
reformers, and which alone, with regard to the populace, amounted almoſt to a
total change of the eſtabliſhed religion<note n="‖" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. II. p. 60. Collier, vol. II. p. 241.

to ſeparate the uſe of images <pb n="307" facs="tcp:0429000101:312"/> from their abuſe,
the reverence from the worſhip of them; but the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this deſign
was found, upon trial, very difficult, if not wholly imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable.</p>
               <p>AS private maſſes were aboliſhed by law, it became
neceſſary to frame a new communion-office; and the council went ſo far,
in the preface which they had prefixed to this work, as to leave the practice
of auricular confeſſion wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different<note n="§" place="bottom">Burnet, vol I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>. This was a prelude to the entire abolition of that
invention, one of the moſt powerful engines that ever was contrived for
degrading the laity, and giving their ſpiritual guides an entire aſcendant
over them. And it may juſtly be ſaid, that tho' the prieſt's
abſolution, which attends confeſſion, ſerves ſomewhat to eaſe weak
minds from the immediate agonies of ſuperſtitious terror, it operates only
by ſtrongly enforcing ſuperſtition itſelf, and thereby preparing the
mind for a more violent relapſe into the ſame diſorders.</p>
               <p>THE people were at that time extremely diſtracted, by the
oppoſite opinions of their preachers; and as they were totally incapable to
judge of the reaſons ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced on either ſide, and naturally regarded every
thing which they heard at church, as of equal authority, a great confuſion
and fluctuation reſulted from this uncertainty. The council firſt
endeavoured to remedy that inconvenience, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome reſtraints on
preaching; but finding this expedient ineffectual, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a total
ſilence on the preachers, and thus put an end at once to all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemics of
the pulpit<note n="*" place="bottom">Fuller, Heylin, Burnet.</note>. By the
nature of things, this reſtraint could only be temporary. For in proportion
as the ceremonies of public worſhip, its ſhows and exterior obſervances,
were retrenched by the reformers, the people were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to contract a
ſtronger attachment to ſermons, whence alone they received any occupation
or amuſement. The ancient religion, by giving its votaries ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to
do, freed them from the trouble of knowing: Sermons were only deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the
principal churches, and at ſome particular faſts and feſtivals: And the
practice of haranguing the populace, which, if abuſed, is ſo powerful an
incitement to faction and ſedition, had much leſs ſcope and influence
during thoſe ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Affair of Scotland.</note> THE greater
progreſs was made towards a reformation in England, the further did the
protector find himſelf from all proſpect of compleating the union with
Scotland; and the Queen-dowager, as well as the clergy, became the more
averſe to all alliance with a nation which had departed ſo far from all
ancient principles. Somerſet, having taken the town of Haddington, had
ordered it to be ſtrongly garriſoned and fortified, by lord Gray: He alſo
erected ſome ſortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <pb n="308" facs="tcp:0429000101:313"/> at Lauder: And he
hoped, that theſe two places, together with Broughty and ſome ſmaller
for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reſſes, which were in the
hands of the Engliſh, would ſerve as a curb to Scotland; and would give him
acceſs into the heart of the country.</p>
               <p>ARRAN, being diſappointed in ſome attempts on Broughty,
relied chiefly on the ſuceours expected from France, for the recovery of
theſe places; and they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at laſt in the Firth, to the number of
ſix thouſand men; one half of whom were Germans. They were commanded by
Deſſé, and under him by Andelot, Strozzi, Meilleraye, count
Rhingrave. The Scotch were at that time ſo ſunk by their misfortunes, that
five hundred Engliſh horſe were able to ravage the whole country without
reſiſtance; and make inroads to the gates of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital<note n="†" place="bottom">Beagué, hiſt. of the Campagnes, 1548 and 1549, p.
6.</note>: But on the appearance of the French ſuccours, they collected more
courage; and having joined Deſſé with a conſiderable
reinforcement, they laid ſiege to Haddington<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hollingſhed, p. 993.</note>. This was an undertaking for which
they were themſelves totally unfit; being only practiſed in a kind of
deſultory war, where they ſerved without pay, and with a few weeks
proviſions, which they brought along with them. Even with the
aſſiſtance of the French, they placed their chief hopes of ſucceſs in
ſtarving the garriſon; and after ſome vain attempts to take the place by
a regular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iege, the blockade of
Haddington was formed. The garriſon were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed with loſs in ſeveral
ſallies which they made upon the beſiegers.</p>
               <p>THE hoſtile attempts which the late King and the protector had
made againſt Scotland, not being ſteedy, regular, nor puſhed to the
laſt extremity, had ſerved only to irritate the nation, and to inſpire
them with the ſtrongeſt averſion to that confederacy which was courted in
ſo violent a manner. Even thoſe who were inclined to the Engliſh
alliance, were diſpleaſed to have it impoſed on them by force of arms;
and the earl of Huntley in particular, ſaid pleaſantly, that he diſliked
not the match, but he hated the manner of wooing<note n="‖" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 46. Patten.</note>. The Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowager, finding theſe
ſentiments to prevail, called a Parliament, in an abbey near Haddington; and
it was there propoſed, that the young Queen, for her greater ſecurity,
ſhould be ſent to France, and be committed to the protection of that
ancient ally. Some objected, that this meaſure was deſperate, allowed no
reſource in caſe of miſcarriage, expoſed the Scotch to be ſubjected
by foreigners, involved them in perpetual war with England, and left them no
expedient by which they could conciliate the friendſhip of that powerful
nation. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, on the other hand, that the Queen's preſence was
the very cauſe of war with England; that that nation would deſiſt when
they found that their views <pb n="309" facs="tcp:0429000101:314"/> of forcing a marriage had
become altogether impracticable; and that Henry, being engaged by ſo high a
mark of confidence, would take their ſovereign un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his guardianſhip, and
uſe his utmoſt efforts to defend the kingdom. Theſe arguments were aided
by French gold, which was plentifully diſtributed among the nobles. The
governor had a penſion conferred on him of twelve thouſand livres a year,
received the title of duke of Chatelrault, and obtained for his ſon the
command of an hundred men at arms<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. II. p.
83. Buchan. lib. XV. Keith, p. 55. Thuanus, lib. V. c. 15.</note>. And as all
the clergy dreaded the conſequences of the Engliſh alliance, they
ſeconded this meaſure with all the zeal and induſtry which either
principles or intereſt could inſpire. 
<note place="margin">Young Queen of Scots ſent into
France.</note> It was accordingly determined to ſend the Queen to France; and
what was underſtood to be the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence, to marry her to
the dauphin. Villegaignon, commander of four French gallies lying in the Firth
of Forth, ſet ſail as if he intended to return home; but when he reached
the open ſea, he turned northwards, paſſed by the Orkneys, and came in on
the weſt coaſt at Dunbarton: A very extraordinary voyage for ſhips of
that fabric<note n="†" place="bottom">Thuanus, lib. V. c. 15.</note>. The
young Queen was there committed to him; and being attended with the lords

ſafely at Breſt, whence ſhe was conducted to Paris, and ſoon after
ſhe was betrothed to the dauphin.</p>
               <p>SOMERSET, preſſed by many difficulties at home, and
deſpairing of ſucceſs in his enterprize againſt Scotland, was
deſirous of compoſing the differences with that kingdom, and he offered the
Scotch a ten years truce; but as they inſiſted on his reſtoring all the
places which he had taken, the propoſal came to nothing. The Scotch took the
fortreſſes of Hume and Faſt-caſtle, by ſurprize, and put the
garriſon to the ſword: They repulſed, with loſs, the Engliſh, who,
under the command of lord Seymour, made a deſcent, firſt in Fife, and then
at Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe: In the former action, James Stuart, natural brother to the
Queen, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired great honour; in the ſecond action, Areſkine of Dun. An
attempt was made by Sir Robert Bowes and Sir Thomas Palmer, at the head of a
conſiderable body, to throw relief into Haddington; but theſe troops
falling into an ambuſcade, were almoſt wholly cut in pieces<note n="‡" place="bottom">Stowe, p. 595. Hollingſhed, p. 994.</note>. And
tho' a ſmall body of two hundred men eſcaped all the vigilance of the
French, and arrived ſafely in Haddington, with ſome ammunition and
proviſions, the garriſon was reduced to ſuch difficulties, that the
protector found it neceſſary to provide more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for their relief.
He raiſed an army of eighteen thouſand men, and adding three thouſand
Germans, who, on the diſſolution of the proteſtant alliance, had offered 
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0429000101:315"/> their ſervice to England, he gave the command of the
whole to the earl of Shrewſbury<note n="‖" place="bottom">Hayward, p.
201.</note>. D'Eſſé raiſed the ſiege on the approach of the
Engliſh; and with great difficulty made good his retreat to Edinburgh, where
he poſted himſelf advantageouſly. Shrewſbury, who had loſt the
opportunity of attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him on his march, durſt not give him battle in his
preſent ſituation; and contenting himſelf with the advantage already
gained of ſupplying Haddington, he retired into England.</p>
               <p>DURING the abode of the French troops many complaints had
ariſen between them and the Scotch; and a ſmall accident<note n="*" place="bottom">Beaagué, p. 68. Knox, p. 81.</note>having excited a tumult
in Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, the provoſt and his ſon were unfortunately killed by the
French ſoldiers. This event increaſed the animoſity between the two
nations: But D'Eſſe, in order to make atonement for that act of violence,
led his troops haſtily to Haddington, and in the night-time attempted to
ſurprize the town. He found the garriſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared to reſiſt him; and
had already entered the outer court: But a French deſerter firing a cannon,
which pointed towards the gates, the ſhot fell among the thickeſt of the
enemy, and made ſuch havoc as threw the whole into confuſion, and enabled
the Engliſh to repulſe them. It is pretended, that no leſs than a hundred
perſons fell by this ſingle ſhot.</p>
               <p>THE French general was a man of ability and experience; but as
he had not the good fortune to be acceptable to the Scotch nation, it was
thought proper to recall him, and to ſend over De Thermes in his place.
D'Eſſé, before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, fortified Leith, which, from a
ſmall village, ſoon became a conſiderable town, by the concourſe of
inhabitants, who found there a ſecurity, which they could no where elſe
enjoy in Scotland. He alſo attacked an Engliſh garriſon in Inch-keith, an
iſland oppoſite to that harbour, and made them priſoners. After theſe
exploits, he reſigned his command to De Thermes, who brought over with him
Monluc, biſhop of Valence, a man celebrated for wiſdom and capacity. This
prelate was named chancellor of the kingdom; and it was probably intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by
his means, to inſpire the nation with ſome greater attachment to the
prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of law and equity: But the Scotch, impatient of reſtraint, and
jealous of a foreigner, expreſſed ſuch diſcontent, that it was thought
more prudent ſoon after to recall him<note n="†" place="bottom">Burnet,

               <p>THO' the protection of France was of great conſequence to the
Scotch, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them againſt the invaſions of England, they reaped
ſtill more benefit from the diſtractions and diviſions which had crept
into the councils of that latter <pb n="311" facs="tcp:0429000101:316"/> kingdom. Even the two
brothers, the protector and admiral, not contented with the high ſtations
which they ſeverally enjoyed, and the great eminence to which they had
riſen, had entertained the moſt violent jealouſy of each other's
authority; 
<note place="margin">Cabals of lord Seymour.</note> and they
divided the whole court and kingdom, by their oppoſite cabals and
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions. Lord Seymour was a man of inſatiable ambition, arrogant,
aſſuming, implacable; and tho' eſteemed of ſuperior capacity to the
protector, he poſſeſſed not to the ſame degree the confidence and
regard of the people. By his flattery and addreſs, he had ſo inſinuated
himſelf into the good graces of the Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowager, that, forgetting her
uſual prudence and decency, ſhe married him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the deceaſe
of the late King: Inſomuch, that, had ſhe ſoon proved pregnant, it might
have been doubtful to which huſband the child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed. The credit and
riches of this alliance ſupported the ambition of the admiral; but gave
umbrage to the dutcheſs of Somerſet, who, uneaſy that the younger
brother's wife ſhould have the precedency, employed all her intereſt with
her huſband, which was too great, firſt to create, and then to widen a
breach between the two brothers<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hayward, p. 301.

               <p>THE firſt ſymptoms of this miſunderſtanding appeared
when the protector commanded the army in Scotland. The ſecretary, Paget, a
man entirely devoted to Somerſet, remarked, that Seymour was forming
ſeparate intrigues among the counſellors; was corrupting, by preſents,
the King's ſervants; and even endeavouring, by improper indulgencies and
liberalities, to captivate the affections of the young monarch. Paget
repreſented to him the danger of this conduct; deſired him to reflect on
the numerous enemies whom the ſudden elevation of their family had created;
and warned him that any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion between him and the protector, would
be greedily laid hold of, to draw on the ruin of both. Finding his
remonſtrances ineffectual, he convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed intelligence of the danger to
Somerſet, and engaged him to leave the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize againſt Scotland
unfiniſhed, in order to guard againſt the attempts of his domeſtic
enemies. In the enſuing Parliament, the admiral's projects appeared ſtill
more hazardous to public tranquillity; and as he had acquired many partizans
and retainers, he made a direct attack upon his brother's autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. He
repreſented to his friends, that formerly, during a minority, the office of
protector of the kingdom had been kept ſeparate from that of governor of the
king's perſon; and that the preſent union of theſe two important
truſts, conſerred on Somerſet an authority which could not ſafely be
lodged in any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject<note n="‖" place="bottom">Haynes, p. 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, 90.</note>. He even prevailed on the
young King, to write a letter to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <pb n="312" facs="tcp:0429000101:317"/>
deſiring that Seymour might be appointed his governor; and he had formed a
party in the two houſes, by which he hoped to have effected his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
The deſign was diſcovered before its execution; and ſome common friends
were ſent to remonſtrate with him, but had ſo little influence, that he
threw out many menacing expreſſions, and raſhly threatened, that, if he
was thwarted in his attempt, he would make this Parliament the blackeſt that
ever was in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<note n="*" place="bottom">Haynes, p. 75.</note>. The council
ſent for him, to anſwer for his conduct; but he refuſed to attend: They
then began to threaten in their turn, and informed him, that the King's letter,
inſtead of availing him any thing to the execution of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, would
be imputed to him as a criminal enterprize, and be conſtrued a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to
diſturb the government, by forming a ſeparate intereſt with a child and
minor. They even let fall ſome menaces of ſending him to the Tower for his
temerity; and the admiral finding himſelf prevented in his deſign, was
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſubmit, and to deſire a reconcilement with his brother.</p>
               <p>THE mild and moderate temper of Somerſet made him willing to
forget theſe enterprizes of the admiral; but the ambition of that turbulent
ſpirit could not be ſo eaſily appeaſed. His ſpouſe, the
Queen-dowager, died in child-bed; but ſo far from regarding this event as a
check to his aſpiring views, he founded on it the ſcheme of a more
extraordinary elevation. He made his addreſſes to the lady Elizabeth, then
in the ſixteenth year of her age; and that princeſs, whom even the hurry of

of ſucceſſion, if they married without the conſent of his executors,
which Seymour could never hope to obtain; it was concluded, that he propoſed
to effectuate his purpoſe by expedients ſtill more raſh and more
criminal. All the other meaſures of the admiral tended to confirm this
ſuſpicion. He continued to attack, by preſents, the fidelity of all
thoſe who had more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate acceſs to the King's perſon: He endeavoured
to ſeduce that young prince into his intereſt: He found means of holding a
private correſpondence with him: He publicly decried his brother's
adminiſtration; and aſſerted, that by enliſting Germans, and other
foreigners, he intended to form a mercenary army, which endangered the King's
aughority, and the liberty of the people: By promiſes and perſuaſion he
brought over to his party many of the principal nobility; and had diſtributed
his intereſt all over England: He neglected not even the moſt 
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0429000101:318"/> popular perſons of inferior rank; and had computed,
that he could, on occaſion, command the ſervice of ten thouſand men,
among his ſervants, tenants, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers<note n="‡" place="bottom">Haynes, p. 105, 106.</note>: He had already provided arms for
their uſe; and having engaged in his intereſts Sir John Sharington, a very
corrupt man, maſter of the mint at Briſtol, he flattered himſelf that
money would not be wanting. Somerſet was well informed of all theſe
alarming circumſtances, and endeavoured by the moſt friendly expedients, by
intreaty, reaſon, and even by heaping new favours upon him, to make him
depart from his precipitant councils: But finding all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
ineffectual, he began to think of more ſevere remedies. The earl of Warwic
was an ill inſtrument between the brothers; and had formed the deſign, by
inflaming the quarrel, to raiſe his own fortune on both their ruins.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Dudley, earl of Warwic.</note> DUDLEY, earl
of Warwic, was the ſon of that Dudley, miniſter to Henry the ſeventh, who
having, by rapine, extortion, and perverſion of law, incurred the hatred of
the public, had been ſacrificed to popular animoſity, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of
the ſubſequent reign. The late King, ſenſible of the iniquity, at
leaſt illegality of the ſentence, had afterwards reſtored young Dudley's
blood by act of parliament; and finding him endowed with ability, induſtry,
and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, he had entruſted him with many important commands, and had
ever found him ſucceſsful in all his undertakings. He raiſed him to the
dignity of viſcount Liſle, conferred on him the office of admiral, and gave
him by his will a place among his executors. Dudley made ſtill farther
progreſs during the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority; and having obtained the title of earl of
Warwic, and undermined the credit of Southampton, he bore the firſt rank
among the protector's counſellors. The victory, gained at Pinkey, was much
aſcribed to his courage and conduct; and he was univerſally regarded as a
man equally endowed with the talents of peace and war. But all theſe virtues
were obſcured by ſtill greater vices; an exorbitant ambition, an
inſatiable avarice, a neglect of decency, a contempt of juſtice: And as he
found, that lord Seymour, whoſe ability and enterprize he chiefly dreaded,
was involving himſelf in ruin, by his raſh councils, he was determined to
puſh him to the precipice; and thereby remove the chief obſtacle to his own
projected greatneſs.</p>
               <p>WHEN Somerſet found that the public peace was expoſed by his
brother's ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, if not rebellious, ſchemes, he was the more eaſily
perſuaded, by Warwic, to employ the extent of royal authority againſt him;
and after depriving him of the office of admiral, he ſigned a warrant for
committing him to the Tower. Some of his accomplices were alſo taken into
cuſtody; and three privy counſellors, being ſent to examine them, made a
report, that they had met with very full <pb n="314" facs="tcp:0429000101:319"/> and important
diſcoveries. Yet ſtill the protector ſuſpended the blow, and ſhowed a
reluctance to ruin his brother. He offered to depart from the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if Seymour would promiſe him a cordial reconcilement; and relinquiſhing all
ambitious hopes, be contented with a private life, and retire into the country.
But as Seymour made no other anſwer to theſe friendly offers than menaces
and defiances, he ordered a charge to be drawn up againſt him, conſiſting
of thirty-three articles<note n="‖" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. II. Coll.
31. 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. c. 18.</note>; and the whole to be laid before the
privy-council. It is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that every particular was ſo inconteſtibly
proved, both by witneſſes and his own hand-writing, that there was no room
for doubt; yet did the council think proper to go in a body to the Tower, in
order more fully to examine the priſoner. He was not daunted by the
appearance; but boldly demanded a fair trial; required to be confronted with
the witneſſes; deſired that the charge might be left with him, in order
to be conſidered; and refuſed to anſwer any interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, by which he
might enſnare himſelf.</p>
               <p>IT is apparent, that notwithſtanding what is pretended, there
muſt have been ſome deficiency in the evidence againſt Seymour, when
ſuch demands, founded on the plaineſt principles of law and equity, were
abſolutely rejected. We ſhall indeed conclude, if we carefully examine the
charge, that many of the articles were general, and ſcarce capable of any
proof; many of them, if true, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of a more favourable
interpretation; and that, tho' on the whole, Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour appears to have been a
very dangerous ſubject, yet he had not advanced far in thoſe treaſonable
projects imputed to him. The chief part of his guilt ſeems to have
conſiſted in ſome unwarrantable practices in the admiralty, by which
pyrates were protected, and illegal impoſitions laid upon the merchants.</p>
               <p>BUT the adminiſtration had, at that time, an eaſy
inſtrument of vengeance, to wit, the Parliament; and needed not give
themſelves any concern with regard either to the guilt of the perſons whom
they proſecuted, or the evidence which could be produced againſt them.

                  <note place="margin">4 Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> A ſeſſion of

<label type="milestone">

priſoner was beheaded on Tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill. The warrant was ſigned by Somerſet,
who was expoſed to much blame, on account of the violence of theſe
proceedings. The attempts of the admiral ſeemed chiefly to be levelled
againſt his brother's uſurped authority; and tho' his ambitious,
enterprizing character, encouraged by a marriage with the lady Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,
might have proved dangerous to public tranquillity, the prudence of
foreſeeing dangers at ſuch a diſtance, was eſteemed too great, and the
remedy was plainly illegal. It could only be ſaid, that this bill of
attainder was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more tolerable than the preceding ones, to which the
nation had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed. For here, at leaſt, ſome ſhadow of
evidence was produced.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Eccleſiaſtical affairs.</note> ALL the
other conſiderable buſineſs tranſacted this ſeſſion, beſides
the attainder of lord Seymour, regarded eccleſiaſtical matters; which were
now the chief concern of the nation. A committee of biſhops and divines had
been appointed by the council, to frame a liturgy for the ſervice of the
church; and they had executed the work committed to them. They proceeded with
great moderation in this delicate undertaking: They retained as much of the
ancient maſs as the principles of the reformers would permit: They indulged
nothing to the ſpirit of contradiction, which ſo naturally takes place in
all great innovations: And they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lattered themſelves, that they had framed a ſervice, in which
every denomination of Chriſtians might, without ſcruple, concur. The maſs
had been always celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Latin; a practice which might have been
eſteemed abſurd, had it not been found uſeful to the clergy, by
impreſſing the people with an idea of ſome myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious unknown virtue
in thoſe rites, and by checking all their pretenſions to be familiarly
acquainted with their religion. But as the reformers pretended in ſome few
particulars to encourage private judgment in the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ity, the tranſlation of the
liturgy, as well as of the ſcriptures, into the vulgar tongue, ſeemed more
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the genius of their ſect; and this innovation, with the
retrenchment of prayers to ſaints, and of ſome ſuperſtitious
ceremonies, was the chief differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <pb n="316" facs="tcp:0429000101:321"/> between the old
maſs and the new liturgy. The Parliament eſtabliſhed this form of
worſhip in all the churches, and ordered an uniformity to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in
all the rites and ceremonies<note n="†" place="bottom">2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI.
cap. 1.</note>.</p>
               <p>THERE was another very material act, which paſſed this
ſeſſion. The former canons had eſtabliſhed the celibacy of the
clergy; and though this practice be uſually aſcribed to the policy of the
court of Rome, who thought, that the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics would be more devoted
to their ſpiritual head, and leſs dependant on the civil magiſtrate, when
freed from the powerful tyes of wives and children; yet was this inſtitution
much forwarded by the principles of ſuperſtition inherent in human nature.
Theſe principles had rendered the panegyrics of an inviolate chaſtity ſo
frequent among the antient fathers, long before the eſtabliſhment of
celibacy. And even the Engliſh parliament, though they framed a law,
permitting the marriages of prieſts, yet confeſs, in the preamble, 
<q rend="inline">"that it were better for prieſts and the
miniſters of the church to live chaſte and without marriage, and it were
much to be wiſhed they would of themſelves abſtain."</q> The
inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which had ariſen from compelling chaſtity and prohibiting
marriage, are the reaſon aſſigned for indulging a liberty in this
particular<note n="‡" place="bottom">2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 21.</note>.
The ideas of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance alſo were ſo much retained in other particulars,
that an act of parliament paſſed, prohibiting the uſe of fleſh, during
Lent and the other times of abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                     <p>2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 19. Another act, paſſed this
ſeſſion, takes notice in the preamble, that the city of York, formerly
well inhabited, was now much decayed: Inſomuch that many of the cures could
not afford a competent maintenance to the incumbents. To remedy this
inconvenience, the magiſtrates were empowered to unite as many pariſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> as they thought proper. An
eccleſiaſtical hiſtorian, Collier, vol. ii. p. 230, thinks, that this
decay of York is chiefly to be aſcribed to the diſſolution of
monaſteries, by which the revenues fell into the hands of perſons who lived
at a diſtance.</p> 
                     <p>A very grievous tax was impoſed this ſeſſion upon
the whole ſtock and monied intereſt of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and even upon its
induſtry. It was a ſhilling in the pound yearly, during three years, on
every perſon worth ten pounds or upwards: The double on aliens and denizons.
Theſe laſt, if above twelve years of age, and if worth leſs than twenty
ſhillings, were to pay eight pence yearly. Every wether was to pay two pence
yearly; every ewe three pence. The woolen manufacturers were to pay eight pence
a pound on the value of all the cloth they made. Theſe exorbitant taxes on
money are a proof, that few people lived on the money lent out at intereſt:
For this tax amounts to the half of the yearly income of all money-holders,
during three years, eſtimating their intereſt at the rate allowed by law;
and was too grievous to be born, if many perſons had been affected by it. It
is remarkable, that no tax at all was laid upon land this ſeſſion. The
profits of merchandiſe were commonly ſo high, that it was ſuppoſed it
could bear this impoſition. The moſt abſurd part of the law ſeems to be
the tax upon the woolen manufacture. See 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 36. The
ſubſequent Parliament repealed the tax on ſheep and woolen cloth. 3 &amp;
4 Edw. VI. cap. 23. But they continued the other tax a year longer. Ibid.</p> 
                     <p>The clergy taxed themſelves at ſix ſhillings in the
pound to be paid in three years. This taxation was ratified in Parliament,
which had been the common practice ſince the reformation, as if the clergy
had no legiſlative power, even over themſelves. See 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap.

                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:0429000101:322"/> THE principal tenets and practices of the
catholic religion were now aboliſhed, and the reformation, ſuch as we enjoy
it at preſent, was almoſt entirely compleated in England. But the doctrine
of the real preſence, though tacitly condemned by the new communion-ſervice
and by the prohibition of many antient rites, ſtill retained ſome hold of
the minds of men; and it was the laſt doctrine of popery, which was wholly
abandoned by the people<note n="†" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. II. cap.
104.</note>. The extreme attachment of the late King to that tenet might be
ſome ground for this obſtinacy; but the chief cauſe was really the
extreme abſurdity of the principle itſelf, and the profound vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which of courſe it impreſſed on the underſtanding. The prieſts
likewiſe were much inclined to favour an opinion, which attributed to them
ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a power; and the people, who believed that they participated
of the very body and blood of their Saviour, were loth to renounce ſo
extraordinary, and as they imagined, ſo ſalutary a privilege. The general
attachment to this dogma was ſo violent, that the Lutherans,
notwithſtanding their ſeparation from Rome, had thought proper, under
another name, ſtill to retain it: And the catholic preachers, in England,
when reſtrained in every other particular, could not forbear, on every
occaſion, from inculcating that tenet. Bonner, for this offence among others,
had been tried by the council, had been deprived of his ſee, and had been
committed to cuſtody. Gardiner alſo, who had recovered his liberty,
appeared anew refractory to the authority, which eſtabliſhed the late
innovations; and he ſeemed willing to countenance that opinion, much favoured
by all the Engliſh catholics, that the King was indeed ſupreme head of the
church, but not the council, during a minority. Having declined giving full
ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction on this head, he was ſent to the Tower, and threatened with
farther effects of the council's diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>THESE ſeverities, being exerciſed againſt men,
poſſeſſed of office and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſeemed a neceſſary policy, in
order to inforce an uniformity in public worſhip and diſcipline: But there
were other inſtances of perſecution, which were derived from no other
origin than the bigotry of theologians; a malady, which ſeems almoſt
incurable. Tho' the proteſtant divines had ventured to renounce opinions,
deemed certain during ſo many centuries, they regarded, in their turn, the
new ſyſtem as ſo certain, that they could bear no contradiction 
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0429000101:323"/> with regard to it; and they were ready to burn in the
ſame flames, from which they themſelves had ſo narrowly eſcaped, every
one who had the aſſurance to oppoſe them. A commiſſion by act of
council was granted to the primate and ſome others, to examine and ſearch
after all anabaptiſts, heretics, or contemners of the book of common
prayer<note n="*" place="bottom">

poſſible; to impoſe pennance on them; and to give them abſolution: Or
if they were obſtinate, to excommunicate and impriſon them, and to deliver
them over to the ſecular arm: And in the execution of this charge, the
commiſſioners were not bound to obſerve the ordinary methods of trial;
the forms of law were diſpenſed with, and if any ſtatutes happened to
interfere with the powers in the commiſſion, they were over-ruled and
abrogated by the council. Some tradeſmen in London were brought before
theſe commiſſioners, and were accuſed of maintaining, among other
opinions, that a man regenerate could not ſin, and that though the outward
man might offend, the inward was incapable of all guilt. They were prevailed on
to abjure and were diſmiſſed. But there was a woman accuſed of
heretical pravity, called Joan Bocher, or Joan of Kent, who was ſo extremely
obſtinate, that the commiſſioners could gain nothing upon her. Her
doctrine was, 
<q rend="inline">"that Chriſt was not truly incarnate of the
virgin, whoſe fleſh, being the outward man, was ſinfully begotten and
born in ſin; and conſequently, he could take none of it: But the word, by

would ſeem, is not orthodox; and there was a neceſſity for delivering the
woman to the flames for maintaining it. But the young King, tho' in ſuch
tender years, had more ſenſe than all his counſellors and preceptors; and
he long refuſed to ſign the warrant for her execution. Cranmer was employed
to perſwade him to compliance; and he ſaid, that there was a great
difference between errors in other points of divinity, and thoſe which were
directly contradictory to the Apoſtles creed: Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe latter were impieties againſt God, which the
prince, being God's deputy, ought to repreſs; in like manner, as the King's
deputies were bound to puniſh offences againſt the King's perſon. Edward,
overcome by importunity more than reaſon, at laſt ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, tho' with
tears in his eyes; and he told Cranmer, that, if any wrong was done, the guilt
ſhould lie entirely on his head. The primate, after making a new effort to
reclaim the woman from her errors, and finding her obſtinate againſt all
his arguments, at laſt committed her to the flames. Some time after, a
Dutchman, called Van Paris, accuſed of the hereſy which has received the
name of Arianiſm, was condemned to the ſame puniſhment. He 
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0429000101:324"/> ſuffered with ſo much ſatisfaction, that he hugged
and careſſed the faggots, which were conſuming him; a ſpecies of frenzy

               <p>THESE rigorous methods of proceeding ſoon brought the whole
nation to a conformity with the new doctrine and the new liturgy. The lady Mary

no abuſe ſo great, in civil ſociety, as not to be attended with a great
variety of beneficial conſequences; and in the beginnings of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
the loſs of theſe advantages is always felt very ſenſibly, while the
benefit, reſulting from the change, is the ſlow effect of time, and is
ſeldom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the bulk of a nation. Scarce any inſtitution can be
imagined leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, in the main, to the intereſts of mankind than
that of monks and friars; yet was it followed by many good effects, which,
having ceaſed by the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of monaſteries, were very much
regreted by the people of England. The monks, reſiding always in their
convents, in the heart of their eſtates, ſpent their money in the provinces
and among their tenants, afforded a ready market for commodities, were a ſure
reſource to the poor and indigent; and though their hoſpitality and charity
gave but too much encouragement to idleneſs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the encreaſe of
public riches, yet did it provide to many a remedy againſt 
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0429000101:325"/> the extreme preſſures of want and neceſſity. It
is alſo obſervable, that, as the friars were limited by the rules of their
inſtitution, to a certain train of life, they had not equal motives for
avarice with other men; and they were acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have been in England, as
they ſtill are in Roman catholic countries, the beſt and moſt indulgent
landlords. The abbots and priors were allowed to give leaſes at an
under-value, and to receive, in return, a large preſent from the tenant; in
the ſame manner as is ſtill practiſed by the biſhops and colleges. But
when the abbey-lands were diſtributed among the great nobility and courtiers,
they fell under a different management: The rents of farms were raiſed, while
the tenants found not the ſame facility in diſpoſing of the produce; the
money was ſpent in the capital; and the farmers, living at a diſtance, were
expoſed to all the oppreſſions of their new maſters, or to the ſtill
greater rapacity of the ſtewards.</p>
               <p>THESE complaints of the common people were at that time
heightened by other cauſes. The arts of manufacture were much more advanced
in other Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean countries than in England; and even in England theſe arts
had made greater progreſs than the knowledge of agriculture; a
profeſſion, which of all mechanical employments, requires the moſt
reflection and experience. A great demand aroſe for wool both abroad and at
home: Paſturage was found more profitable than unſkilful tillage: Whole
eſtates were laid waſte by incloſures: The tenants, regarded as a
uſeleſs burthen, were expelled their habitations: Even the cottagers,
deprived of the commons, on which they fed their cattle, were reduced to
miſery: And a great decay of people, as well as diminution of the former
plenty, was remarked in the kingdom<note n="*" place="bottom">Strype, vol. II.
Repoſitory Q.</note>. This grievance was now of an old date; and Sir Thomas
More, alluding to it, obſerves in his Utopia, that a ſheep had become in
England a more rapacious animal than a lion or wolf, and devoured whole
villages, cities, and provinces.</p>
               <p>THE general encreaſe alſo of gold and ſilver in Europe,
after the diſcovery of the Weſt Indies, had a tendency to inflame theſe
complaints. The growing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, in the more commercial countries, had
heightened every where the price of commodities, which could eaſily be
tranſported thither; but in England, the labour of men, who could not ſo
eaſily change their habitation, ſtill remained nearly at the antient rates;
and the poor people complained that they could no longer gain a
ſubſiſtence by their induſtry. It was by an addition alone of toil and
application they were enabled to provide a maintenance; and tho' this
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of induſtry was at laſt the effect of the preſent
ſituation, and an effect <pb n="321" facs="tcp:0429000101:326"/> very beneficial to ſociety,
yet was it difficult for the people to ſhake off their former habits of
indolence; and nothing but neceſſity could compel them to that exertion of
their faculties.</p>
               <p>IT muſt alſo be remarked, that the profuſion of Henry the
eighth, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him, notwithſtanding his rapacity, to ſuch
difficulties, that he had been obliged to remedy a preſent neceſſity, by
the pernicious expedient of debaſing the coin; and the wars, in which the
protector had been involved, had induced him to carry ſtill farther the
ſame abuſe. The uſual conſequences enſued: The good coin was hoarded
or exported; baſe metal was coined at home or imported from abroad in great
abudance; the common people, who received their wages in it, could not
purchaſe commodities at the uſual rates; an univerſal diffidence and
ſtagnation of commerce took place; and loud complaints were heard in every
part of England.</p>
               <p>THE protector, who loved popularity, and compaſſionated the
condition of the people, encouraged theſe complaints by his endeavours to
remedy them. He appointed a commiſſion for making enquiry concerning
incloſures; and iſſued a proclamation, ordering all late incloſures to
be laid open by a day aſſigned. The populace, meeting with ſuch
countenance from the government, began to riſe in ſeveral places, and to
commit diſorders; but were quieted by remonſtrances and perſuaſion. In
order to give them greater ſatisfaction, Somerſet appointed new
commiſſioners, whom he ſent every where, with an unlimited power to hear
and determine all cauſes about incloſures, high-ways, and cottages<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. II. p. 115. Strype, vol. II. p. 171.</note>. As
the object of this commiſſion was very diſagreeable to the gentry and
nobility, they called the commiſſion arbitrary and illegal; and the common
people, fearing it would be eluded, and being impatient for immediate
redreſs, could no longer contain their ſury, but ſought for a remedy by
force of arms. 
<note place="margin">Inſurrections.</note> The riſing began at
once in ſeveral parts of England, as if an univerſal conſpiracy had been
formed by the commonalty. The inſurgents in Wiltſhire were diſperſed by
Sir William Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert: Thoſe in the neighbouring counties, Oxford and
Gloceſter, by lord Gray of Wilton. Many of the rioters were killed in the
field: Others were executed by martial law. The commotions in Hampſhire,
Suſſex, Kent, and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, were quieted by gentler methods; but the
diſorders in Devonſhire and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk threatened the moſt fatal
conſequences.</p>
               <p>THE commonalty in Devonſhire began with the uſual pretence
of incloſures and of oppreſſions from the gentry; but the pariſh
prieſt of Sampford-Courtenay, had the addreſs to give their diſcontents a
direction towards religion; and the delicacy of this ſubject, in the
preſent emergence, made the inſurrection imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately <pb n="322" facs="tcp:0429000101:327"/> appear dangerous. In other counties, the gentry had kept cloſely
united with the government; but here many of them took part with the populace;
among others, Humphrey Arundel, governor of St. Michael's Mount. The rioters
were brought to the form of a regular army, and amounted to the number of
10,000 men. Lord Ruſſel had been ſent againſt them at the head of a
ſmall force; but finding himſelf too weak to encounter them in the field,
he kept at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and began to treat and negotiate with them; in hopes
of eluding their fury by delay, and of diſperſing them by the difficulty of
their ſubſiſting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Their demands were, that the maſs ſhould
be reſtored, half of the abbey-lands reſumed, the law of the ſix articles
executed, holy water and holy bread reſpected, and all other particular
grievances redreſſed<note n="*" place="bottom">Hayward, p. 292.
Hollingſhed, p. 1003. Fox, vol. II. p. 666. Mem. Cranm. p. 186.</note>. The
council, to whom Ruſſel tranſmitted theſe demands, ſent a haughty
anſwer; exhorted the rebels to diſperſe; and promiſed them pardon upon
their immediate ſubmiſſion. Enraged at this diſappointment, they
marched to Exeter; carrying before them croſſes, banners, holy water,
candleſticks, and other implements of the antient ſuperſtition; together
with the hoſte, which they covered with a canopy<note n="†" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 76.</note>. The inhabitants of Exeter ſhut their
gates; and the inſurgents, as they had no can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, endeavoured to take the
place, firſt by ſcalade, then by mining, but were repulſed in all their
attempts. Ruſſel meanwhile lay at Honiton, till reinforced by Sir William
Herbert, and lord Gray, with ſome German horſe, and ſome Italian
arquebuſiers under Battiſta Spinola. He then reſolved to attempt the
relief of Exeter, which was now reduced to extremities. He attacked the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, drove them from all their poſts, committed great ſlaughter upon
them both in the action and purſuit<note n="‡" place="bottom">Stow's
Annals, p. 597. Hayward, p. 295.</note>, and took many priſoners. Arundel and
the other leaders were ſent to London, tried and executed. Many of the
inferior ſort were put to death by martial law<note n="§" place="bottom">Hayward, p. 295, 296.</note>: The vicar of St. Thomas, one of the
principal incendiaries, was hanged on the top of his own tower, arrayed in his
popiſh weeds, with his beads at his girdle<note n="‖" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 76. Hollingſhed, p. 1026.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE inſurrection in Norfolk roſe ſtill to a greater
height, and was attended with greater violences. The populace were at firſt
excited, as in other places, by the complaints againſt incloſures; but
finding their numbers amount to twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, they grew inſolent on
their force, and proceeded to more exorbitant pretenſions. They required the
ſuppreſſion of the gentry, the placing new coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors about the King,
and the re-eſtabliſhment of the antient rites. One Ket, a tanner, had
aſſumed the government of them; and he exerciſed his authority 
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0429000101:328"/> with the utmoſt inſolence and outrage. Having taken
poſſeſſion of Mouſhold-Hill near Norwich, he erected his tribunal
under an old oak, thence called the oak of reformation; and ſummoning the
gentry to appear before him, he gave ſuch decrees as might be expected from
his character and ſituation. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of Northampton was firſt ordered
againſt him; but met with a repulſe, in an action, where lord Sheffield was
killed<note n="*" place="bottom">Stowe, p. 597. Hollingſhed, 1030-31.

protector affected popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, and cared not to appear in perſon againſt
the inſurgents: He therefore ſent next the earl of Warwic at the head of
6000 men, levied for the wars againſt Scotland; and he thereby afforded his
mortal enemy an opportunity of augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reputation and character.
Warwic, having tried ſome ſkirmiſhes with the rebels, at laſt made a
general attack upon them, and put them to flight. Two thouſand of them fell
in the fight and purſuit: Ket was hanged at Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich caſtle; nine of his
followers on the boughs of the oak of reformation; and the inſurrection was
entirely ſuppreſſed. Some rebels in Yorkſhire, hearing of the fate of
their companions, accepted the offers of pardon, and threw down their arms. A
general indemnity was ſoon after publiſhed by the protector<note n="†" place="bottom">Hayward, p. 297, 298, 299.</note>.</p>

tho' the inſurrections were thus quickly ſuppreſſed in England, and no
traces of them ſeemed to remain, they were attended with very bad
conſequences with regard to the foreign intereſts of the nation. The forces
of the earl of Warwic, which might have made a great impreſſion on
Scotland, were diverted from that enterprize; and De Thermes had leizure to
reduce that country to ſome ſettlement and compoſure. He took the
fortreſs of Broughty, and put the garriſon to the ſword. He ſtraitened
the Engliſh at Haddington; and though lord Dacres found means to throw relief
into the place, and to reinforce the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, it was found very
expenſive, and even impracticable to keep poſſeſſion of that
fortreſs. The whole country in the neighbourhood was laid waſte by the
inroads both of the Scotch and Engliſh, and could afford no ſupply to the
gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon: The place lay above thirty miles from the borders; ſo that a
regular army was neceſſary to eſcort thither any proviſions: And as the
plague had broke out among the troops, they periſhed daily, and were reduced
to a ſtate of great weakneſs. For theſe reaſons, orders were given to
diſmantle Haddington, and to convoy the artillery and garriſon to Berwic;
and the earl of Rutland, now created warden of the eaſt marches, executed the
orders.</p>

attempted to ſurprize Boulenberg, and was repulſed; but the garriſon, not
thinking the place tenable after the loſs of the other fortreſſes,
deſtroyed the works, and retired to Boulogne. The rains, which fell in great
abundance during the autumn, and a peſtilential diſtemper, which broke out
in the French camp, depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Henry of all hopes of ſucceſs againſt
Boulogne itſelf; and he retired to Paris<note n="†" place="bottom">Hayward, p. 300.</note>. He left the command of the army to
Gaſpar de Coligny, lord of Chatillon, ſo famous afterwards under the name
of admiral Coligny; and he gave him orders to form the ſiege early in the

               <p>STROZZI, who commanded the French fleet and galleys, endeavoured

hiſtorians of the two nations differ ſo widely in their accounts of the
event<note n="‡" place="bottom">Le Thou, King Edward's Journal, Stow, p.

               <p>AS ſoon as the French war broke out, the protector endeavoured
to fortify himſelf with the alliance of the emperor; and he ſent over
ſecretary Paget to Bruſſels, where Charles then reſided, in order to
aſſiſt Sir Philip Hobby, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ambaſſador, in this
negotiation. But that prince had formed a deſign of extending his dominions
by acting the part of champion to the catholic religion; and tho' extremely
deſirous of fortifying himſelf by the Engliſh alliance againſt France,
his capital enemy, he thought it unſuitable to his other pretenſions to
enter into ſtrict confederacy with a nation, which had broke off all
connexions with the church of Rome. He therefore declined all advances of
friendſhip from England; and eluded the applications of the ambaſſadors.
An exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is preſerved of this negotiation in a letter of Hobby; and
it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the emperor, in a converſation with the Engliſh
miniſters, aſſerted, that the prerogatives of a King of England were more
extenſive than thoſe of a King of France<note n="§" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. II. p. 132, 175.</note>. Burnet, who preſerves this
letter, ſubjoins, as a parallel inſtance, that one objection which the
Scotch made to marrying their Queen with Edward, was that all their privileges
would be ſwallowed up by the great prerogative of the Kings of England<note n="‖" place="bottom">Id. p. 133.</note>.</p>
               <p>SOMERSET, finding no aſſiſtance from the emperor, was
inclined to conclude a peace with France and Scotland; and beſides that he
was not in a condition to maintain ſuch ruinous wars, he thought, that there
no longer remained any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <pb n="325" facs="tcp:0429000101:330"/> of hoſtilities. The
Scotch had ſent away their Queen; and could not, if ever ſo much inclined,
compleat the marriage contracted with Edward: And as Henry the eighth had
ſtipulated to reſtore Boulogne in 1554, it ſeemed a matter of ſmall
conſequence to anticipate a few years, the term of the treaty. But when he
propoſed theſe reaſons to the council, he met with ſtrong oppoſition
from his enemies, who, ſeeing him unable to ſupport the war, were
determined, for that very reaſon, to oppoſe all propoſals for a
pacification. The factions ran very high in the court of England; and matters
were drawing to an iſſue, fatal to the authority of the protector.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Factions in the council.</note>AFTER
Somerſet obtained the patent, inveſting him with regal authority, he no
longer paid any attention to the opinion of the other counſellors; and being
elated with his high dignity, as well as with his victory at Pinkey, he
thought, that every one ought, in every thing, to yield to his ſentiments.
All thoſe who were not entirely devoted to him, were ſure to be neglected;
whoever oppoſed his will received marks of anger or contempt<note n="*" place="bottom">Strype, vol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> II. p. 181.</note>; and while he ſhowed
a reſolution to govern every thing, his capacity appeared not, in any
reſpect, proportioned to his ambition. Warwic, more ſubtle and artificial,
covered more exorbitant views under fairer appearances; and having
aſſociated himſelf with Southampton, who had been readmitted into the
council, he formed a ſtrong party, who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to free themſelves
from the ſlavery, impoſed on them by the protector.</p>
               <p>THE malecontent counſellors found the diſpoſition of the
nation very favourable to their deſigns. The nobility and gentry were in
general diſpleaſed with the preference, which Somerſet ſeemed to have
given the people; and as they aſcribed all the inſults to which they had
been lately expoſed, to his procraſtination, and to the encouragement given
the multitude, ſo they apprehended a renewal of the ſame diſorders from
his preſent affectation of popularity. He had erected a court of requeſts
in his own houſe for the relief of the people<note n="†" place="bottom">

and he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with the judges in their behalf; a meaſure which might
be denominated illegal, if any exertion of prerogative, at that time, could
with certainty deſerve that appellation. And this attempt, which was a
ſtretch of power, ſeemed the more unpolitic, that it diſguſted the
nobility, the ſureſt ſupport of monarchical authority.</p>
               <p>BUT tho' Somerſet courted the people, the intereſt, which he
had formed with them, was in no degree anſwerable to his expectations. The
catholic party, who retained influence with the multitude, were his declared
enemies; and took ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of every opportunity to decry his conduct. The
attainder and execution of his brother bore an odious aſpect: The
introduction of foreign troops into the <pb n="326" facs="tcp:0429000101:331"/> kingdom, was
repreſented in very invidious colours: The great eſtate which he had
ſuddenly acquired, at the expence of the church and of the crown, rendered
him obnoxious: And the palace which he was building in the Strand, ſerved, by
its magnificence, and ſtill more by other circumſtances which attended it,
to expoſe him to the cenſures of the public. The pariſh church of St.
Mary, with three biſhops houſes, were pulled down, to furniſh ground and
materials for this ſtructure: Not contented with that ſacrilege, an attempt
was made to demoliſh St. Margaret's, Weſtminſter, and to employ the
ſtones to the ſame purpoſe; but the pariſhioners roſe in a tumult,
and chaced away the protector's tradeſmen. He then laid his hands on a chapel
in St. Paul's Church-yard, with a cloiſter, and charnel-houſe belonging to
it; and theſe edifices, together with a church of St. John of Jeruſalem,
were made uſe of to raiſe his palace. To render the matter more odious to
the people, the tombs, and other monuments of the dead were defaced; and the
bones carried away, and buried in unconſecrated ground<note n="†" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 72, 73. Stowe's Survey of London. Hayward, p. 30<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

theſe imprudences were remarked by Somerſet's enemies, who reſolved to
take advantage of them. The lord St. John, preſident of the council, the
earls of Warwic, Southampton, and Arundel, with five counſellors more, met at
Ely-houſe; and aſſuming to themſelves the whole power of the council,
began to act independent of the protector, whom they repreſented as the
author of every public grievance and misfortune. They wrote letters to the
chief nobility and gentry in England, informing them of the preſent

aldermen of London, and enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to obey their orders, without regard to
any contrary orders which they ſhould receive from the duke of Somerſet.
They laid the ſame injunctions on the lieutenant of the tower, who
expreſſed his reſolution to comply with them. Next day, Rich, lord
chancellor, the marquis of Northampton, the earl of Shrewſbury, Sir Thomas
Cheney, Sir John Gage, Sir Ralph Sadler, and the lord chief juſtice Montague,
joined the malecontent counſellors; and every thing bore a bad aſpect for
the protector's authority. Secretary Petre, whom he had ſent to treat with
the council, choſe rather to remain with them; and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon council of the

               <p>THE protector had no ſooner heard of the defection of the
counſellors, than he removed the King from Hampton-court, where he then
reſided, to the caſtle <pb n="327" facs="tcp:0429000101:332"/> of Windſor; and, arming his
friends and ſervants, ſeemed reſolute to defend himſelf againſt all
his enemies. But finding, that no man of rank, except Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Paget,
adhered to him, that the people did not riſe at his ſummons, that the City
and Tower had declared againſt him, that even his beſt friends and
confidents had deſerted him, he loſt all hopes of ſucceſs, and began to
apply to his enemies for pardon and forgiveneſs. No ſooner was this
deſpondency known, than lord Ruſſel, Sir John Baker, ſpeaker of the
houſe of commons, and three counſellors more, who had hitherto remained
neuters, joined Warwic's party, whom every body now regarded as maſters. The
council informed the public, by proclamation, of their actions and intentions;
they wrote to the princeſſes Mary and Elizabeth, to the ſame purpoſe;
they made addreſſes to the King, in which, after the humbleſt
proteſtations of duty and obedience, they informed him, that they were the
council appointed by his father, for the government of the kingdom during his
minority; that they had choſen the duke of Somerſet protector, with the
expreſs condition that he ſhould guide himſelf by their advice and
direction; that he had uſurped the whole authority to himſelf, and had
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, and even in every thing oppoſed, their advice; that he had
proceeded to that height of preſumption, as to levy forces againſt them,
and place theſe forces about his majeſty's perſon: They therefore begged,
that they might be admitted to his royal preſence, that he would be pleaſed
to reſtore them to his confidence, and that Somerſet's ſervants might be
diſmiſſed. 
<note place="margin">Somerſet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns the

capitulated only for gentle treatment, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him. He was,
however, ſent to the Tower<note n="*" place="bottom">Stowe, p. 600.</note>,
with ſome of his friends and partizans, among whom was Cecil, who was

chief, at leaſt the beſt founded, is his uſurpation of the government,
and his taking into his own hands the whole adminiſtration of affairs. The
clauſe of his patent, which inveſted him with abſolute power, unlimited
by any law, was never objected to him; plainly, becauſe, according to the
ſentiments of thoſe times, that power was, in ſome degree, involved in
the very idea of regal authority.</p>
               <p>THE catholics were extremely elevated with this revolution; and
as they had aſcribed all the late innovations to Somerſet's councils, they
hoped, that his fall would prepare the way for the return of the ancient
religion. But Warwic, who now bore chief ſway in the council, was entirely
indifferent with regard to all theſe points of controverſy; and finding,
that the principles of the reformation <pb n="328" facs="tcp:0429000101:333"/> had ſunk deeper
into the young prince's mind than to be eaſily eradicated, he was determined
to comply with his inclinations, and not to hazard his new acquired power by
any hazardous councils. He took care very early to expreſs his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of
ſupporting the reformation; and he threw ſuch diſcouragements on
Southampton, who ſtood at the head of the Romaniſts, and whom he
conſidered as a dangerous rival, that the high-ſpirited nobleman retired
from the council, and ſoon after died of vexation and diſappointment. The
other counſellors, who had concurred in bringing about the revolution,
received their reward, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions and new honours. Ruſſel was created
earl of Bedford: The marquis of Northampton obtained the office of great

ſooner was peace concluded with France, than a project was entertained of a

               <p>THE intention of marrying the King to a daughter of Henry, who
was a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perſecutor of the proteſtants, was no wiſe acceptable to
that party in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: But, in all other reſpects, the council was very
ſteady in promoting the reformation, and in enforcing the laws againſt the
Romaniſts. Many of the prelates were ſtill addicted to that communion; and
tho' they made ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances, in order to ſave their biſhoprics, they
retarded, as much as they ſafely could, the execution of the new laws, and
gave countenance to ſuch as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent or refractory. A reſolution was
therefore taken to ſeek pretences for depriving them; and the execution of
this intention was the more eaſy, that they had all of them been obliged to
take commiſſions, in which it was declared, that they held their ſees
only during the King's pleaſure. It was thought proper to<note place="margin">Proſecution of Gardiner.</note>begin with Gardiner, in order to
ſtrike a terror into the reſt. The method of proceeding againſt him was
extremely violent, and had ſcarce any colour of law or juſtice. It had been
preſcribed him, to inculcate in a ſermon, the duty of obedience to a King
even during his minority; and becauſe he had neglected this topic, he had
been thrown into priſon, and had been there detained during two years,
without being accuſed of any crime, except diſobedience to this arbitrary
command. The duke of Somerſet, ſecretary Petre, and ſome others of the
council, were now ſent, in order to try his temper, and endeavour to find
ſome <pb n="331" facs="tcp:0429000101:336"/> ground for depriving him: He profeſſed to
them his intention of conforming to the government, of ſupporting the King's
laws, and of officiating by the new liturgy. This was not the diſpoſition
which they expected or deſired<note n="‖" place="bottom">Heylin, p.
90.</note>: A new deputation was therefore ſent, who carried him ſeveral
articles to ſubſcribe. He was to acknowlege his former miſbehaviour, and
confeſs the juſtice of his confinement: He was likewiſe to own, that the
King was ſupreme head of the church; that the power of making and
diſpenſing with holidays, was part of the prerogative; that the
common-prayer book was a godly and commendable form; that the King was a
compleat ſovereign in his minority; that the act of the ſix articles was
juſtly repealed; and that the King had full authority to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and reform
what was amiſs in eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, government, or doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.
The biſhop was willing to put his hand to all the articles except the
firſt: He maintained his conduct to have been inoffenſive; and declared,
that he would not own himſelf guilty of faults which he had never
committed<note n="*" place="bottom">Collier, vol. II. p. 305. from the council
books. Heylin, p. 99.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE council, finding that he had gone ſuch lengths, were
determined to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his full compliance, by multiplying the difficulties
upon him, and ſending him new articles to ſubſcribe. A liſt was
ſelected of ſuch points as they thought would be moſt hard of
digeſtion; and not content with theſe, they inſiſted ſtill on his
ſubmiſſion, and an acknowlegement of paſt errors. To make this
ſubſcription more mortifying, they required a promiſe, that he would
recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and publiſh all theſe articles from the pulpit: But Gardiner,
who ſaw, that they intended either to ruin or diſhonour him, or perhaps
both, was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to gratify his enemies by any farther compliances: He
ſtill inſiſted on his innocence; deſired a fair trial; and refuſed to
ſubſcribe more articles, till he ſhould recover his liberty. For this
pretended offence his biſhopric was put under ſequeſtration for three
months; and as he then appeared no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant than at firſt, a
commiſſion was appointed to try, or, more properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to condemn
him. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1551</label> The commiſſioners were, the primate,
the biſhops of London, Ely, and Lin oln, ſecretary Petre, Sir James Hales,
and ſome other lawyers. Gardiner objected to the legality of the
commiſſion, which was not founded on any ſtatute or precedent; and he
appealed from the commiſſioners to the King. His appeal was not regarded:
Sentence was pronounced againſt him: He was deprived of his biſhopric: And
committed to cloſe cuſtody: His books and papers were ſeized: All company
was denied him; and it was not allowed him either to ſend or receive any

had agreed to hold his office during the King's pleaſure: But the council,
unwilling to make uſe of a conceſſion which had been ſo illegally and
arbitrarily exacted, choſe rather to employ ſome forms of juſtice; a
reſolution, which led them to commit ſtill greater iniquities and
ſeverities. But the violence of the reformers did not ſtop there. Day,
bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Chicheſter, Heathe of Worceſter, and Voiſey of Exeter, were
deprived of their biſhoprics, under pretence of diſobedience. Even Kitchen
of Landaff, Capon of Saliſbury, and Sampſon of Coventry, tho' they had
complied in every thing, yet not being ſuppoſed cordial or hearty in their
obedience, were obliged to ſeek protection, by ſacrificing the moſt
conſiderable revenues of their ſee, to the rapacious courtiers<note n="*" place="bottom">Goodwin de praeſul. Angl. Heylin, p. 100.</note>.</p>
               <p>THESE plunderers of the church neglected not even ſmaller
profits. An or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was iſſued by council, for purging the library of
Weſtminſter of all miſſals, legends, and other ſuperſtitious
volumes, and delivering their garniture to Sir Anthony Aucher<note n="†" place="bottom">Collier, vol. II. p. 307. from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil books.</note>. Many of
theſe books were plaited with gold and ſilver, and curiouſly
emboſſed; and this finery was probably the ſuperſtition that
deſtroyed them. Great havoc was likewiſe made on the libraries of Oxford.
Books and manuſcripts were deſtroyed without diſtinction: The volumes of
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity ſuffered for their rich binding: Thoſe of literature were
condemned as uſeleſs: Thoſe of geometry and aſtronomy were ſuppoſed
to contain nothing but necromancy<note n="‖" place="bottom">Wood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

had not power to oppoſe theſe barbarous vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences: They were in danger of

the earl of Warwic and his aſſociates.</p>
               <p>THO' every thing yielded to the authority of the council, the
lady Mary could never be brought to compliance; and ſhe ſtill continued to
adhere to the maſs, and to reject the new liturgy. Her behaviour was, during
ſome time, connived at; but, at laſt, her two chaplains, Mallet and
Berkeley, were thrown into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<note n="§" place="bottom">Strype, vol.

diſobedience. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil wrote her a letter, where they endeavoured to make
her change her ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to perſuade her, that her religious faith
was very ill grounded. They aſked her, what warrant there was in ſcripture
for prayers in an unknown tongue, the uſe of images, or offering up the
ſacrament for the dead; and they deſired her to peruſe St. Auſtin, and
the other ancient doctors, who would convince her of the errors of the Romiſh
ſuperſtition, and prove that it was founded merely on falſe miracles and
lying ſtories<note n="‡" place="bottom">Fox, vol. II<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Collier,

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0429000101:338"/> all this advice, and proteſted herſelf willing to
endure death rather than relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh her religion: She only feared, ſhe
ſaid, that ſhe was not worthy to ſuffer in ſo holy a cauſe: And as

hoped never to read any of them. Dreading farther violence, ſhe endeavoured
to make her eſcape to her kinſman Charles; but her deſign was
diſcovered and prevented<note n="*" place="bottom">Heyward, p. 315.</note>. The
emperor remonſtrated in her behalf, and even threatned hoſtilities, if
liberty of conſcience was refuſed her: But tho' the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, ſenſible
that the kingdom was in no condition to ſupport, with honour, ſuch a war,
was deſirous to comply; they found great difficulty to overcome the
ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the young King. He had been educated in ſuch a violent
abhorrence of the maſs, and other popiſh rites, which he regarded as
impious and idolatrous, that he ſhould participate, he thought, in the ſin,
if he allowed its commiſſion: And when at laſt the imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

his ſiſter's obſtinacy, and bewailing his own fate, that he muſt
ſuffer her to continue in ſuch an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable mode of worſhip.</p>
               <p>THE great object, at this time, of antipathy among the
proteſtant ſects, was popery, or, more properly ſpeaking, the papiſts.
Theſe they regarded as the common enemy, who threatened every moment to
overwhelm the evangelical faith, and deſtroy its partizans by fire and
ſword: They had not as yet had lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to attend to the other minute
diviſions among themſelves, which afterwards became the object of ſuch
furious quarrels and animoſities, and threw the whole kingdom into
confuſion. Several Lutheran divines, who had reputation in thoſe days,
Bucer, Peter Martyr, and others, were engaged to take ſhelter in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
from the perſecutions which the emperor exerciſed in Germany; and they
received protection and encouragement. John A-laſco, a nobleman, uncle to the
King of Poland<note n="†" place="bottom">Fox, vol. III. p. 40.</note>,
being expelled his country by the rigours of the catholics, ſettled, during
ſome time, at Embden in Eaſt-Friezland, where he became preacher to a
congregation of the reformed. Foreſeeing the perſecutions which enſued,
he removed to England, and brought his congregation along with him. The
council, who regarded them as induſtrious, uſeful people, and deſired to
invite over others of the ſame character, not only gave them Auguſtine
friars church for the exerciſe of their religion, but granted them a charter,
by which they were erected into a corporation, conſiſting of a
ſuper-intendant and four aſſiſting miniſters. This eccleſiaſtical
eſtabliſhment was quite independant of the church of England, and differed
from it in ſome rites and ceremonies<note n="‖" place="bottom">Mem.

were matter of triumph to the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, who inſiſted, that the moment men
departed from the authority of the church, they loſt all criterion of truth
and falſehood in matters of religion, and muſt be carried away by every
wind of doctrine. The continual variations of every ſect of proteſtants,
afforded them the ſame topic of reaſoning. The book of common prayer
ſuffered in England a new reviſal, and ſome rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which
had given offence, were omitted<note n="*" place="bottom">Mem. Cranm. p.

were alſo fixed in forty two articles. Theſe articles were intended to
obviate further diviſions and variations; and the framing them had been
poſtponed till the eſtabliſhment of the liturgy, which was regarded as a

               <p>THE theological zeal of the council, tho' ſeemingly fervent,
went not ſo far as to make them neglect their own temporal concerns, which
ſeem to have been ever uppermoſt in their thoughts: They even found
leiſure to attend to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic intereſt; nay, to the commerce of the
nation, which was, at that time, very little the object of general ſtudy or
attention. The trade of England had anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently been carried on altogether by
foreigners, chiefly the inhabitants of the Hanſe-towns, or Eaſterlings, as
they were called; and in order to encourage theſe merchants to ſettle in
England, they had been erected into a corporation by Henry the third, had
obtained a patent, were endowed with privileges, and were exempted from
ſeveral heavy duties paid by aliens. So ignorant were the Engliſh of
commerce, that this company, commonly denominated the merchants of the
Steel-yard, engroſſed almoſt the who'e foreign trade of the kingdom; and
as they naturally employed the ſhipping of their own country, the naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of England was alſo in a very languiſhing condition. It was therefore
thought proper by the council to find pretences for annulling the privileges of
this corporation, privileges which put them nearly on an equal footing with
Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen in the duties which they paid; and as ſuch patents were, during
that are granted by the abſolute power of the King, men were the leſs

innovation, by Lubec, Hamburgh, and other Hanſe towns; but the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
perſevered in their reſolution, and the good effects of it became ſoon
viſible to the nation. The Engliſh, by their very ſituation as na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0429000101:340"/> above foreigners in the purchaſe of cloth, wool, and

their induſtry, or engage them to become rivals to this opulent company: But

not contented with the ſtation which he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, carried farther his
pretenſions, and had gained to himſelf partizans who were diſpoſed to
ſecond him in every enterprize. The laſt earl of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land died
without iſſue; and as Sir Thomas Piercy, his brother, had been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
on account of the ſhare which he had in the Yorkſhire inſurrection during
the late reign, the title was at preſent extinct, and the eſtate was
veſted in the crown. Warwic now procured to himſelf a grant of thoſe
ample poſſeſſions, which lay chiefly in the North, the moſt warlike
part of the kingdom; and he was dignified with the title of duke of
Northumberland. His friend, Paulet, lord St. John, the treaſurer, was created
firſt earl of Wiltſhire, then marqueſs of Wincheſter; Sir William
Herbert was made earl of Pembroke.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His ambition.</note> BUT the ambition of
Northumberland made him regard all increaſe of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions and
titles, either to himſelf or partizans, as ſteps only to further
acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. Finding that Somerſet, tho' degraded from his dignity, and
even leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened in the public opinion by his ſpiritleſs conduct, ſtill
enjoyed a conſiderable ſhare of popularity, he was determined to ruin a man
whom he regarded as the chief obſtacle to the attainment of his hopes. The
alliance which had been formed between the families had produced no cordial
union, and only enabled Northumberland to compaſs with more certainty the
deſtruction of his rival. He ſecretly gained many of the friends and
ſervants of that unhappy nobleman: <pb n="336" facs="tcp:0429000101:341"/> He ſometimes
terrified him by the appearance of danger: Sometimes provoked him by ill
uſage. The unguarded Somerſet often broke out into menacing
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions againſt Northumberland: At other times, he formed raſh
projects, which he immediately abandoned: His treacherous confidents carried to
his enemy every paſſionate word which dropped from him: They revealed the
ſchemes, which they themſelves had firſt ſuggeſted<note n="*" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 112.</note>: And Northumberland, thinking that the
proper ſeaſon was now come, began to act in an open manner againſt
him.</p>

of Somerſet, the lord Grey, David and John Seymour, Hammond and Neudigate,
two of the duke's ſervants, Sir Ralph Vane and Sir Thomas Palmer were
arreſted and committed to cuſtody. Next day, the dutcheſs of Somerſet,
with her favourites, Crane and his wife, Sir Miles Partridge, Sir Michael
Stanhope, Banniſter, and others were thrown into priſon. Sir Thomas Palmer,
who had all along acted the part of a ſpy upon Somerſet, accuſed him of
having formed a deſign to raiſe an inſurrection in the north, to attack
the gens d'armes on a muſter-day, to ſecure the Tower, and to excite a
rebellion in London: But what was the only probable accuſation, he
aſſerted, that Somerſet had once laid a project for murdering
Northumberland, Northampton, and Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke at a banquet, which was to be given
them by lord Paget. Crane and his wife confirmed Palmer's teſtimony with
regard to this laſt deſign; and it appears that ſome raſh ſcheme of
that nature had been mentioned; tho' no regular conſpiracy had been formed,
nor means prepared for its execution. Hammond confeſſed, that the duke had
armed men to guard him one night in his houſe at Greenwich.</p>

brought to his trial before the marquis of Wincheſter, who acted as high
ſteward. Twenty-ſeven peers ſat as the jury, among whom were
Northumberland, Pembroke, and Northampton, whom decency ſhould have hindered
from acting as judges in the trial of a man, who appeared to be their capital

               <p>WE have a very imperfect account of all ſtate trials during

ſome more regularity was obſerved in the management of this proſecution

(circumſtances required by the ſtrict principles of equity) their

lame with <pb n="337" facs="tcp:0429000101:342"/> regard to the treaſonable part of the
charge; and Somerſet's defence was ſo ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, that the peers
gave verdict in his favour: The intention alone of aſſaulting the privy
counſellors was ſupported by any tolerable evidence; and the jury brought
him in guilty of felony. The priſoner himſelf confeſſed, that he had
mentioned the deſign of murdering Northumberland and the other lords; but had
not formed any reſolution on that head: And when he received ſentence, he
aſked pardon of thoſe peers for the deſigns which he had hearkened to
againſt them. The people, by whom Somerſet was beloved, hearing the firſt

Somerſet indeed, tho' many actions of his life were very exceptionable,
ſeems, in general, to have merited a better fate; and the faults, which he
committed, were owing to weakneſs, not to any bad intentions. His virtues
were better calculated for private than for public life; and by his want of
penetration and firmneſs, he was ill-fitted to extricate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from
thoſe cabals and violences to which that age was ſo much addicted. Sir
Thomas Arundel, Sir Michael Stanhope, Sir Miles Partridge, and Sir Ralph Vane,
all of them Somerſet's friends, were brought to their trial, condemned and
executed: Great injuſtice ſeems to have been uſed in their proſecution.
Lord Paget, chancellor of the dutchy, was, on ſome pretence, tried in the
Star-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and condemned in a fine of 6000 pounds, with the loſs of his

reformers, it appears, whatever ſcope they had given to their own private
judgment, in diſputing the tenets of the antient religion, were reſolved
not to allow the ſame privilege to others; and the practice, nay the very
doctrine of toleration, was, at that time, equally unknown to all ſects and
parties. To diſſent from the religion of the magiſtrate was univerſally
conceived to be as criminal as to queſtion his title, or rebel againſt his
authority.</p>
               <p>A LAW was enacted againſt uſury; that is, againſt taking
any intereſt for money<note n="†" place="bottom">Ib

effect of antient ſuperſtitions; but being found ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely iniquitous in
itſelf, as well as prejudicial to commerce, it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repealed in

               <p>A BILL was introduced by the miniſtry into the houſe of
lords, renewing thoſe rigorous ſtatutes of treaſons, which had been
abrogated in the beginning of this reign; and tho' the peers, by their high
ſtation, ſtood moſt expoſed to theſe tempeſts of ſtate, yet had
they ſo little regard to public authority, or even to their own true
intereſts, that they paſſed the bill with only one diſſenting
voice<note n="§" place="bottom">Paliamentary Hiſt. vol. III p. 258.

But the commons rejected it, and prepared a new bill, that paſſed into a
law, by which it was enacted, that whoever ſhould call the King or any of his
heirs, named in the ſtatute of the 35th of the laſt reign, heretic,
ſchiſmatic, tyrant, infidel, or uſurper of the crown, ſhould forfeit,
for the firſt offence, their goods and chattels, and be impriſoned during
pleaſure; for the ſecond, ſhould be in a <hi>praemunire;</hi> for the
third, ſhould be attainted of treaſon. But if any ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly
advance ſuch a ſlander in writing, printing, painting, carving or grav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he was, for the firſt offence, to be held a traitor<note n="‖" place="bottom">5 &amp; 6 Edw. VI. cap. 2.</note>. It may be worthy of notice,
that the King and his next heir, the lady Mary, were profeſſedly of
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent religions; and religions, which threw on each other the imputation
of hereſy, ſchiſm, idolatry, prophaneneſs, blaſphemy, wickedneſs,
and all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious epithets, that religious zeal has invented. It was
almoſt impoſſible, therefore, for the people, if they ſpoke on theſe
ſubjects at all, not to fall into the crime, ſo ſeverely puniſhed by
this ſtatute; and the jealouſy of the commons <pb n="339" facs="tcp:0429000101:344"/> for
liberty, tho' it led them to diſſent from the lords, appears not to have
been very active, vigilant or clear-ſighted.</p>
               <p>THE commons annexed to this bill a clauſe which was of much
more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance than the bill itſelf, that no one ſhould be convicted of
any kind of treaſon, unleſs the crime was proved by the oaths of two
witneſſes, who were confronted with the priſoner. The lords ſcrupled to
paſs this clauſe; tho' required by the moſt obvious principles of equity,
and tho' their own intereſt was fully as much concerned as that of the
commons. But the members of that houſe truſted for protection to their
preſent perſonal intereſt and power, and neglected the nobleſt and
moſt permanent ſecurity, that of the laws.</p>
               <p>A BILL was introduced into the houſe of peers for making a
proviſion for the poor; but the commons, not chuſing that a money-bill
ſhould begin in the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, framed a new bill to the ſame purpoſe.
By this bill, the church-wardens were empowered to collect charitable
contributions for the poor, and if any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to contribute, or
diſſwaded others from that charity, the biſhop of the dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe was
empowered to proceed againſt them. Such a large diſcretionary power,
entruſted to the prelates, ſeems as proper an object of jealouſy as the
authority aſſumed by the peers<note n="*" place="bottom">5 &amp; 6 Edw.

               <p>THERE was another occaſion in which the Parliament repoſed
an unuſual confidence in the biſhops. They empowered them to proceed
againſt ſuch as neglected the Sundays and holydays<note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. cap. 3.</note>. But theſe were unguarded conceſſions
granted to the church: The general humour of the times led men to bereave the
eccleſiaſtics of all their power, and even to pillage them of all their
property: Many clergymen were obliged for a ſubſiſtance to turn
carpenters or taylors, and ſome kept alehouſes<note n="‡" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. II. p.

                     </gap>.</note>. The biſhops
themſelves were generally reduced to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and held both their revenues
and ſpiritual office by a very precarious and uncertain tenure.</p>
               <p>TONSTAL, biſhop of Durham, was one of the moſt eminent
prelates of that age, ſtill leſs for the dignity of his ſee, than for his
own perſonal merit, his learning, moderation, humanity, and beneſicence. He
had oppoſed, by his vote and authority, all the innovations in religion; but
ſo ſoon as they were enacted, he had always ſubmitted, and had paid
conformity to each ſyſtem of religion, which was eſtabliſhed. The known
probity of his mind had made this compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance be aſcribed, not to an
intereſted or time ſerving ſpirit, but to a ſenſe of duty, which led
him to think that all private opinions ought to be ſacrificed to the great
concerns of public peace and tranquillity. That general regard which 
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0429000101:345"/> was paid his character, had preſerved him from any
ſevere treatment during the protectorſhip of Somerſet; but when
Northumberland gained the aſcendant, he was thrown into priſon; and as that
rapacious nobleman had formed a deſign of appropriating the revenues of the
ſee of Durham, and of forming to himſelf a principality in the northern
counties, he was reſolved, in order to effectuate his purpoſe, to deprive
Tonſtal of his biſhopric. A bill of attainder, therefore, under pretence of
miſpriſion of treaſon, was introduced into the houſe of peers againſt
that prelate; and it paſſed with the oppoſition only of lord Stourt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, a zealous catholic, and of Cranmer,
who always bore a cordial and ſincere friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the biſhop of
Durham. But when the bill was ſent down to the commons, they required that
witneſſes ſhould be examined, that Tonſtal ſhould be allowed to
defend himſelf, and that he ſhould be confronted with his accuſers: And
when theſe demands were refuſed, they rejected the bill.</p>
               <p>THIS equity, ſo unuſual in the Parliament during that age,
was aſcribed by Northumberland and his partizans, not to any regard for
liberty and juſtice, but to the prevalence of Somerſet's faction in a
houſe of commons, which, being choſen during the adminiſtration of that
nobleman, had been almoſt entirely filled with his creatures. They were
confirmed in this opinion, when they ſound, that a bill confirming the
attainder of Somerſet and his complices was alſo rejected by the commons,
tho' it had paſſed the upper houſe. A reſolution was<note place="margin">15th April.</note>therefore taken to diſſolve the Parliament,
which had ſat during this whole reign; and ſoon after to ſummon a new
one.</p>

his will, ventured on an expedient which could not have been practiſed, or
even thought of, in an age, when there was any idea or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of
liberty. He engaged the King to write circular letters to all the ſheriffs,
in which he enjoined them to inform the freeholders and voters, that they were
required to chooſe men of knowledge and experience for their
repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives. After this general exhortation, the King continued in
theſe words. 
<q rend="inline">"And yet, nevertheleſs, our pleaſure is,
that where our privy council, or any of them ſhall, in our behalf, recommend,
within their juriſdiction, men of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wiſdom; in ſuch caſes,

Several letters were ſent from the King, recommending members to particular
counties, Sir Richard Cotton for Hampſhire; Sir William Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>williams and Sir
Henry Neville for Berkſhire; Sir William Drury and Sir Henry 
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0429000101:346"/> Benningfield for Suffolk, &amp;c. But tho' ſome
counties only received this ſpecies of <hi>congé d'elire</hi> from the
King; the recommendations from the privy council and the councellors, we may
fairly preſume, would extend to the greateſt part, if not to the whole, of
the kingdom.</p>
               <p>IT is remarkable, that this attempt was made during the reign of
a minor King, when the royal authority is uſually weakeſt; that it was
patiently ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to; and that it gave ſo little umbrage as ſcarce to
be taken notice of by any hiſtorian. The painful and laborious collector

Northumberland's expectations. As Tonſtal had in the interval been deprived

                  <note place="margin">Succeſſion changed.</note> THAT nobleman
repreſented to the prince, whom youth and an infirm ſtate of health made
ſuſceptible of every impreſſion, that his two ſiſters, Mary and
Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, had both been declared illegitimate by act of Parliament, and tho'
Henry by his will had reſtored them to a place in the ſucceſſion, the
nation would never bear to ſee the throne of England filled by a baſtard:
That they were only the King's ſiſters by the half-blood; and even if they
were legitimate, could not enjoy the crown as his heirs and ſucceſſors:
That the Queen of Scots ſtood excluded by the king's will; and being an
alien, loſt all right of inheriting by the law; not to mention, that, as
ſhe was betrothed to the dauphin, ſhe would, by her ſucceſſion,
render England, as ſhe had already done Scotland, a province to France: That
the certain conſequence of his ſiſter Mary's ſucceſſion, or that of
the Queen of Scots, was the abolition of the proteſtant religion, the repeal
of thoſe laws enacted in favour of the reformation, and the
re-eſtabliſhment of the uſurpations and idolatry of the church of Rome:
That fortunately for England, the ſame order of ſucceſſion, which
juſtice required, was alſo the moſt conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to public intereſt;
and there was not on any ſide any juſt ground for doubt or deliberation:
That when theſe three princeſſes were excluded by ſuch ſolid
reaſons, the ſucceſſion devolved to the marchioneſs of Dorſet,
eldeſt daughter to the French Queen and the duke of Suffolk: That the next
heir of the marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was the lady Jane Gray, a lady of the moſt amiable
virtue, accompliſhed by the beſt education, both for literature and for
religion; and every way worthy of a throne: And that even, if her title by
blood ſhould be doubtful, which there was no juſt reaſon to pretend, the
King was poſſeſſed of the ſame power, which his father enjoyed; and
might leave her the crown by letters patent. Theſe reaſonings made
impreſſion on the young prince; and above all, his zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous affection for
the proteſtant religion made him apprehend the conſequences, if ſo
bigotted a catholic as his ſiſter Mary ſhould ſucceed to the throne.
And tho' he bore a tender affection to the lady Elizabeth, who was liable to no
ſuch objection, means were found to perſwade him, that he could not exclude
the one ſiſter, on account of illegitimacy, without alſo giving an
excluſion to the other.</p>
               <p>NORTHUMBERLAND, finding that his arguments were likely to
operate on the King, began to prepare the other parts of that political fabric,
which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to raiſe. Two ſons of the duke of Suffolk by a ſecond
venter having died, this ſeaſon, of the ſweating ſickneſs, that title
was extinct; and Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland engaged the King to beſtow it on the marquis
of Dorſet. By means of <pb n="343" facs="tcp:0429000101:348"/> this favour and of others,
which he conferred upon him, he perſuaded the new duke of Suffolk and the
dutcheſs, to give their daughter, the lady Jane, in marriage to his fourth
ſon, the lord Guilford Dudley. In order to fortify himſelf by farther
alliances, he negotiated a marriage between the lady Catherine Gray, ſecond
daughter to Suffolk, and lord Herbert, eldeſt ſon to the earl of Pembroke.
He alſo married his own daughter to lord Haſtings, eldeſt ſon to the
earl of Huntingdon<note n="*" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 109. Stowe, 609.</note>.
Theſe marriages were ſolemnized with great pomp and feſtivity; and the
people, who hated Northumberland, could not forbear expreſſing their
indignation at ſeeing theſe public demonſtrations of joy, during the
languiſhing ſtate of the young prince's health.</p>
               <p>EDWARD had been ſeized in the foregoing year, firſt with the
meaſles, then with the ſmall pox; but having perfectly recovered both
theſe diſtempers, the nation entertained hopes, that they would only
ſerve to confirm his health; and he had afterwards made a progreſs thro'
ſome parts of the kingdom. It was ſuſpected, that he had there
over-heated himſelf in exerciſes: He was ſeized with a cough,<note place="margin">The King's ſicknets.</note>which proved obſtinate, and gave
way neither to regimen nor medicines: Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fatal ſymptoms of a
conſumption appeared; and tho' it was hoped, that, as the ſeaſon of the
year advanced, his youth and temperance might get the better of the malady, men
ſaw with great concern his bloom and vigour inſenſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay. The
general attachment to the young prince, joined to the hatred borne the Dudleys,
made it be remarked, that Edward had every moment declined in health, from the
time that lord Robert Dudley had been put about him, in the quality of
gentleman of the bedchamber.</p>
               <p>THE languiſhing ſtate of Edward's health made Northumberland
the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent on the execution of his project. He removed all, except his
own emiſſaries, from about the King: He himſelf attended him with the
greateſt aſſiduity: He pretended the moſt anxious concern for his
health and welfare: And by all theſe artifices, he prevailed on him to give
his final conſent to the ſettlement projected. Sir Edward Montague, chief
juſtice of the Common Pleas, Sir John Baker and Sir Thomas Bromley, two
judges, with the attorney and ſollicitor general were ſent for to the
council; where, after the minutes of the intended deed were

                  </gap> them up in the form of
letters patent. They heſitated in obeying this order; and deſired time to
conſider of it. The more they reflected, the greater dang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> they ſound in compliance. The
ſettlement of the crown by Henry the eighth had been made in conſequence of
an art of Parliament; and by another act, paſſed in the beginning of this
reign, it was declared treaſon in any of the heirs, their aiders or abettors,
to attempt on the <pb n="344" facs="tcp:0429000101:349"/> right of another, or change the order
of ſucceſſion. The judges pleaded theſe reaſons before the council.
They urged, that ſuch a patent as was intended would be entirely invalid;
that it would ſubject, not only the judges who drew it, but every
counſellor who ſigned it, to the pains of treaſon; and that the only
proper expedient, both to give force to the new ſettlement, and free its
partizans from danger, was to ſummon a Parliament, and obtain the conſent
and ſanction of that aſſembly. The King ſaid, that he intended
afterwards to follow that method, and would call a Parliament, in which he
propoſed to have his ſettlement ratified; but in the mean time, he required
the judges, on their allegiance, to draw the patent in the form required. The
council told the judges, that their refuſal would ſubject them all to the
pains of treaſon. Northumberland gave to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague the appellation of
traitor; and ſaid that he would fight in his ſhirt with any man in ſo
juſt a quarrel as that of the lady Jane's ſucceſſion. The judges were
reduced to great difficulties between the dangers of the law, and thoſe
ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the violence of preſent power and authority<note n="*" place="bottom">Fuller, book VIII. p. 2.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE arguments were canvaſſed in ſeveral different meetings
between the council and the judges; and no ſolution could be found of the
preſent difficulties. At laſt, Montague propoſed an expedient, which
ſatisfied both his brethren and the counſellors. He deſired, that a
ſpecial commiſſion ſhould be paſſed by the King and council,
requiring the judges to draw a patent for the new ſettlement of the crown;
and that a pardon ſhould immediately after be granted them for any offence
which they might have committed by their compliance. When the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was drawn
and brought to the biſhop of Ely, chancellor, in order to paſs the great
ſeal, that prelate required, that all the judges ſhould ſign it.
Goſnald at firſt refuſed; and it was with much difficulty, that he was
prevailed on, by the violent menaces of Northumberland, to comply; but the
conſtancy of Sir James Hales, who, tho' a zealous proteſtant, preferred
juſtice on this occaſion to the prejudices of his party, could not be
ſhaken by any expedient. The chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor next required, for his greater
ſecurity, that all the privy councellors ſhould ſet their hands to the
patent: The intrigues of Northumberland or the fears of his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence<note place="margin">21ſt June.</note>were ſo prevalent, that the counſellors
complied with this demand. Cranmer alone heſitated during ſome time, but
yielded at laſt to the earneſt and pathetic entreaties of the King<note n="†" place="bottom">C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that time ſecretary of ſtate, pretended alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that he only ſigned
as a witneſs to the King's ſubſcription. And thus, by the King's letters
patent, the two princeſſes, Mary and Elizabeth, were ſet aſide; and the
crown was ſettled on the heirs of the dutcheſs of Suffolk: For the
dutcheſs herſelf was content to be poſtponed to her daughters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:0429000101:350"/> AFTER this ſettlement was made, with
ſo many inauſpicious circumſtances, Edward declined viſibly every day
in his health; and ſmall hopes were entertained of his recovery. To make the
matter worſe, his phyſicians were diſmiſſed by Northumberland's
advice and by an order of council; and he was put into the hands of an ignorant
woman, who undertook, in a little time, to reſtore him to his former ſtate
of health. After the uſe of her medicines, all the bad ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
encreaſed to the moſt violent degree: He felt a difficulty of ſpeech and
breathing; his pulſe failed, his legs ſwelled, his colour became livid; and
many<note place="margin">And death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6th July.</note>other ſymptoms
appeared of his approaching end. He expired at Greenwich in the ſixteenth
year of his age, and the ſeventh of his reign.</p>
               <p>ALL the Engliſh hiſtorians dwell with pleaſure on the
excellencies of this young prince; whom the flattering promiſes of hope,
joined to many real virtues, had made an object of the moſt tender affections
of the public. He poſſeſſed mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diſpoſition, application
to ſtudy and buſineſs, a capacity to learn and judge, and an attachment
to equity and juſtice. He ſeems only to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from his education
and from the age in which he lived, too much of a narrow prepoſſeſſion
in matters of religion, which made him incline ſomewhat to bigotry and
perſecution: But as the bigotry of proteſtants, leſs governed by
prieſts, lies under more reſtraints than that of catholics, the effects of
this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant quality were the leſs to be apprehended, if a longer life had

               </argument>
               <p>THE title of the princeſs Mary to the crown, after the
deceaſe of her brother, was not liable to any conſiderable difficulty; and
the objections ſtarted by the lady Jane's partizans, were new and unheard-of
by the nation. Tho' all the proteſtants, and even many of the catholics,
believed the marriage of Henry the eighth with Catherine of Arragon to be
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and invalid; yet as it had been contracted by the parties without any
criminal intention, had been avowed by their parents, recognized by the nation,
and ſeemed ſounded on thoſe principles of law and religion, which then
prevailed, very few imagined, that their iſſue ought on that account to be
regarded as ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate. A declaration to that purpoſe had indeed been
extorted from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament by the uſual violence and caprice of Henry; but
as that monarch had afterwards been induced to reſtore his daughter to the
right of ſucceſſion, her <pb n="348" facs="tcp:0429000101:352"/> title was now become as
legal and parliamentary as it was ever eſteemed juſt and natural. The
public had been long familiarized to theſe ſentiments: During all the reign
of Edward, the princeſs was conſidered as his lawful ſucceſſor: And
tho' the proteſtants dreaded the effects of her prejudices, the extreme
hatred, univerſally entertained againſt the Dudleys<note n="*" place="bottom">Sleidan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lib. 25.</note>, who, men foreſaw, would, under
the name of Jane, be the real ſovereigns, was more than ſufficient to
counterbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, even with that party, the attachment to religion. This laſt
attempt, to violate the order of ſucceſſion, had diſplayed
Northumberland's ambition and injuſtice in a full light; and when the people
reflected on the long train of fraud, iniquity and cruelty, by which that
project had been conducted; that the lives of the two Seymours, as well as the
title of the princeſſes, had been ſacrificed to it; they were moved by
indignation to exert themſelves in oppoſition to ſuch criminal
enterprizes. The general veneration alſo, paid to the memory of Henry the
eighth, prompted the nation to defend the rights of his poſterity; and the
miſeries of the antient civil wars were not ſo entirely forgotten, that men
were willing, by a departure from the lawful heir, to incur the danger of the
like blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and confuſion.</p>
               <p>NORTHUMBERLAND, ſenſible of the oppoſition he muſt
expect, had carefully concealed the deſtination made by the King; and in
order to bring the two princeſſes into his power, he had had the precaution
to engage the council, before Edward's death, to write to them in that prince's
name, deſiring their attendance, under pretext, that his infirm ſtate of
health required the aſſiſtance of their counſel and the conſolation
of their company<note n="†" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 154.</note>. Edward
expired before their arrival; but Northumberland, in order to make the
princeſſes fall into the ſhare, kept the King's death ſtill ſecret;
and the lady Mary had already reached Hoddeſden, within half a day's journey
of the court. Happily, the earl of Arundel ſent her private intelligence,
both of her brother's death and of the conſpiracy formed againſt her<note n="‡" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. II. p. 233.</note>: She immediately made haſte to
retire; and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived by quick journeys, firſt at Kenning-hall in Norfolk,
then at Framlingham in Suffolk; where ſhe propoſed to embark and retire to
Flanders, in caſe ſhe ſhould find it impoſſible to defend her right
of ſucceſſion. She wrote letters to the nobility and moſt
conſiderable gentry in every county of England; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to
aſſiſt her in the defence of her crown and perſon. And ſhe
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a meſſage to the council; by which ſhe notified to them,
that her brother's death was no longer a ſecret to her, promiſed them
pardon for paſt offences, and required them immediately to give orders for
proclaiming her title in London<note n="§" place="bottom">Fox, vol. III. p.

                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:0429000101:353"/> NORTHUMBERLAND found that farther
diſſimulation was vain: He went to Sion-houſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Thuanus, lib. xiii. c. 2.</note>, accompanied with the duke of
Suffolk, the earl of Pembroke, and others of the nobility; and he approached
the lady Jane, who reſided there, with all the reſpect uſually paid to
the ſovereign. Jane was, in a great meaſure,<note place="margin">Lady Jane
Gray pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Queen.</note>ignorant of all theſe tranſactions; and it
was with equal grief and ſurprize, that ſhe received intelligence of
them<note n="†" place="bottom">Godwin in Kennet, p. 329. Heylin, p. 149.
Burnet, vol. II. p. 234.</note>. She was a lady of the moſt amiable perſon,
the moſt engaging diſpoſition, the moſt accompliſhed parts; and being
of an equal age with the late King, ſhe had received all her education with
him, and ſeemed even to poſſeſs a greater facility in acquiring every
part of manly and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite literature. She had attained a knowlege of the Roman
and Greek languages, beſide modern tongues; had paſſed moſt of her time
in an application to learning; and expreſſed a great indifference for other
occupations and amuſements uſual with her ſex and ſtation. Roger
Aſcham, tutor to the lady Elizabeth, having at one time paid her a viſit,
found her employed in the reading of Plato, while the reſt of the family were
engaged in a party of hunting in the park; and upon his admiring the
ſingularity of her choice, ſhe told him, that ſhe received more
pleaſure from that author than the others could reap from all their ſport
and gaity. Her heart, full of this paſſion for literature and the elegant
arts, and of tenderneſs towards her huſband, who was deſerving of her
affection, had never opened itſelf to the flattering allurements of ambition;
and the information of her advancement to the throne was by no means agreeable
to her. She even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to accept the preſent; pleaded the preferable
right of the two princeſſes; expreſſed her dread of the conſequences
attending an enterprize ſo dangerous, not to ſay ſo criminal; and
deſired to remain in that private ſtation in which ſhe was born. Overcome
at laſt with the entreaties, rather than reaſons, of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and
father-in-law, and above all of her huſband, ſhe ſubmitted to their will,
and was prevailed on to relinquiſh her own judgment. It was then uſual for
the Kings of England, after their acceſſion, to paſs the firſt days in
the Tower; and Northumberland immediately conveyed thither the new
ſovereign<note n="‡" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 159.</note>. All the

priſoners in the hands of Northumberland, whoſe will they were

               <p>NORTHUMBERLAND, who had hitherto been blinded by ambition, ſaw
at laſt the danger gather round him, and knew not to what hand to turn
himſelf. He had levied forces, which were aſſembled at London; but
dreading the cabals of the courtiers and counſellors, whoſe compliance, he
knew, had been entirely the reſult of fear or artifice, he was reſolved to
keep near the perſon of the lady Jane, and ſend Suffolk to command the

ſhaking off his uſurped tyranny. Arundel began the conference, by
repreſenting the injuſtice and cruelty of Northumberland, the exorbitancy
of his ambition, the criminal enterprize which he had projected, and the guilt
in which he had involved the whole council; and he aſſerted, that the only
method of making atonement for their paſt offence, was by a prompt return to
the duty which they owed their lawful ſovereign<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 331, 332. Thuanus, lib. xiii.</note>. This motion was

the lady Jane Gray, and lord Guilford Dudley. But Mary was deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in the
beginning of her reign, to acquire popularity by the appearance of clemency;
and becauſe the counſellors pleaded conſtraint, as an excuſe for their
treaſon, ſhe extended her pardon to moſt of them. Suffolk himſelf
recovered his liberty; and he owed this indulgence, in a great meaſure, to
the contempt entertained of his capacity. But the guilt of Northumberland was
too great, as well as his ambition and courage too dangerous, to permit him to
entertain any reaſonable hopes of life. When brought to his trial, he only
deſired permiſſion to aſk two queſtions of the peers who were
appointed to ſit on his jury; whether a man could be guilty of treaſon who
obeyed orders given him by the council under the great ſeal? and whether
thoſe who were involved in the ſame guilt with himſelf, could act as his

Sir Thomas Palmer, and Sir John Gates, ſuffered with him; and this was all
the blood ſpilt on account of ſo dangerous and criminal an enterprize

notwithſtanding that it had paſſed in Parliament, was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as
null and invalid; becauſe, among other informalities, no ſpecial matter had
been alleged againſt him, except wearing a coat of arms, which he and his
anceſtors, without giving any offence, had always made uſe of in the face
of the court and of the whole nation. Courtney received the title of earl of
Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire; and tho' educated in ſuch cloſe confinement, that he was
altogether unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the world, he ſoon acquired all the
accompliſhments of a courtier and a gentleman, and made a conſiderable
figure during the few years which he lived after he recovered his liberty.
Beſides performing all thoſe popular acts, which, tho' they only regarded
individuals, were very acceptable to the nation, the Queen endeavoured to
ingratiate herſelf with the public, by granting a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pardon, tho' with

               <p>THE joy ariſing from the ſucceſſion of the lawful heir,
and from the gracious demeanour of the ſovereign, hindered not the people
from being agitated with great anxiety concerning the ſtate of religion; and
as the bulk of the nation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the proteſtant communion,
apprehenſions were generally entertained of the principles and prejudices of
the new Queen. The legitimacy of Mary's birth had appeared to be ſomewhat
connected with the papal authority; and as that princeſs was educated with
her mother, ſhe had imbibed the ſtrongeſt attachment to the catholic
communion, and the higheſt averſion to thoſe new tenets, whence, ſhe
believed, all the misfortunes of her family had originally ſprung. The
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements which ſhe lay under from her father, tho' at laſt they
brought her to comply with his will, tended ſtill more to increaſe her
diſguſt to the reformers; and the vexations which the protector and the
council gave her, during Edward's reign, had no other effect than to confirm
her farther in her prejudices. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a four and obſtinate temper, and

the active part which he bore in promoting her mother's divorce, as well as in

ſtill remained ſuch numbers devoted, by opinion or affection, 
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0429000101:360"/> to many principles of the ancient religion, that the
authority of the crown was able to give ſuch candidates the prevalence in
moſt elections; and all thoſe who ſcrupled compliance with the court
religion, rather declined taking a ſeat in the houſe, which, while it
rendered them obnoxious to the Queen, could afterwards afford them no
protection againſt the violence of prerogative. It ſoon appeared,
therefore, that a majority of the commons would be obſequious to Mary's
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; and as the peers were moſtly attached to the court, from
intereſt or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, little oppoſition was expected from that
quarter.</p>
               <p>IN opening the Parliament, the court ſhowed a very ſignal
contempt of the laws, by celebrating, before the two houſes, a maſs of the
Holy Ghoſt, in the Latin tongue, attended with all the ancient rites and
ceremonies, tho' aboliſhed by act of parliament<note n="*" place="bottom">Fox,

at this ſervice, was very ſeverely handled, and was violently thruſt out

The Queen, however, ſtill retained the title of ſupreme head of the church
of England; and it was generally pretended, that the intention of the court was
only to reſtore religion to the ſame condition in which it had been left by
Henry; but that the other abuſes of popery, which were chiefly grievous to
the nation, would never be revived.</p>
               <p>THE firſt bill paſſed by the Parliament, was of a very
popular nature, and aboliſhed every ſpecies of treaſon which was not
contained in the ſtatute of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the third, and every ſpecies of felony
which did not ſubſiſt before the firſt of Henry the eighth<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mariae, ſeſſ. 1. c. 1. By this repeal, tho' it
was in general popular, the clauſe of 5 and 6 Edw. VI. c. 11. was loſt,
which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the confronting two witneſſes, in order to prove any

ratified the marriage of Henry with Catherine of Arragon, and annulled the
divorce pronounced by Cranmer<note n="‖" place="bottom">Mariae,
ſeſſ. 2. c. 1.</note>, whom they greatly blamed on that account. No
mention, however, is made of the pope's authority, as any ground of the
marriage. The ſtatutes of King Edward with regard to religion, were repealed
by one vote<note n="§" place="bottom">1 Mariae, ſeſſ. 2. c.
12.</note>; and thereby the national religion was replaced on the ſame
foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on which it ſtood at the death of Henry. The attainder of the duke
of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk was reverſed; and this act of juſtice was much more
reaſonable than the declaring that attainder invalid, without farther
authority. Moſt of the clauſes of the riot act, paſſed in the late
reign, were revived: A ſtep which eluded, in a great meaſure, the popular
ſtatute enacted at the firſt meeting of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the compliance of the two houſes with the
Queen's will, they had ſtill a reſerve in certain articles; and her choice
of a huſband was, in <pb n="357" facs="tcp:0429000101:361"/> particular, of ſuch importance
to national intereſt, that they were determined not to ſubmit tamely, in
that reſpect, to her will and inclination. There were three marriages<note n="*" place="bottom">Thuan. lib. ii. c. 3.</note>, concerning which it was
ſuppoſed that Mary deliberated after her acceſſion to the crown. The
firſt perſon propoſed to her, was Courtney, earl of Devonſhire, who,
being an Engliſhman, nearly allied to the crown, could not fail to be
acceptable to the nation; and as he was of an engaging perſon and addreſs,
he had gained viſibly on the Queen's affections, and hints were dropt him of
her favourable diſpoſitions towards him<note n="†" place="bottom">Godwin, p. 339.</note>. But that nobleman ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected theſe
overtures; and ſeemed rather to attach himſelf to the lady Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,
whoſe youth, and agreeable converſation, he preferred to all the power and
grandeur of her ſiſter. This choice occaſioned a great coldneſs of Mary
towards Devonſhire; and made her break out in a declared animoſity
againſt Elizabeth. The ancient quarrel between their mothers had ſunk deep
into the malignant heart of the Queen; and after the declaration made by
Parliament in favour of Catherine's marriage, ſhe wanted not a pretence for
repreſenting the birth of her ſiſter as illegitimate. The attachment of
Elizabeth to the reformed religion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Mary's bigotry; and as the young
princeſs had made ſome difficulty of diſguiſing her ſentiments, very
violent menaces had been employed to bring her to compliance. But when the
Queen found that Elizabeth had obſtructed her views in a point, which,
perhaps, touched her ſtill more nearly, her reſentment, excited by pride,
knew no longer any bounds; and the princeſs was viſibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the

               <p>CARDINAL Pole, who had never taken any but deacon's orders, was
another party propoſed to the Queen; and there appeared many reaſons to
induce her to make choice of this prelate. The high character of Pole for
virtue and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity; the great regard paid him by the catholic church, of
which he had near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reached the higheſt dignity on the death of Paul the
third<note n="‖" place="bottom">Father Paul, book iii.</note>; the Queen's
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for the counteſs of Saliſbury, his mother, who had once been her
gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the violent animoſity to which he had been expoſed on account
of his attachment to the Romiſh communion; all theſe conſiderations had a
pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful influence on Mary. But the cardinal was now in the decline of life;
and having contracted habits of ſtudy and retirement, he was repreſented as
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified for the buſtle of a court, and the hurry of buſineſs<note n="§" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 31.</note>. The Queen, therefore, dropt all
views of that alliance: But as ſhe entertained a great regard for Pole's
wiſdom and virtue, ſhe ſtill propoſed to reap the benefit of his advice
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0429000101:362"/> in the adminiſtration of her government. She
ſecretly entered into a negociation with Commendone, an agent of cardinal
Dandino, legate at Bruſſels; ſhe ſent aſſurances to the pope, then
Julius the third, of her earneſt deſire to reconcile herſelf and her
kingdoms to the holy ſee; and ſhe deſired that Pole might be appointed
legate for the performance of that pious office<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet,

               <p>THESE two marriages being rejected, the Queen caſt her eye
towards the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's family, from which her mother was deſcended, and
which, during her greateſt diſtreſſes, had always afforded her
countenance and protection. Charles the fifth, who a few years before was
almoſt abſolute maſter of Germany, had exerciſed his power in ſuch an
arbitrary manner, that he gave extreme diſguſt to the nation, who
apprehended the total extinction of their liberties and privileges from the
encroachments of that monarch<note n="†" place="bottom">Thuanus, lib. iv.
c. 17.</note>. Religion had ſerved him as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for his uſurpations;
and from the ſame principle he met with that oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which overthrew
his grandeur, and daſhed all his ambitious hopes. Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, elector of
Saxony, enraged that the landgrave of Heſſe, who, by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and on
his aſſurances, had put himſelf into the emperor's hands, ſhould be
unjuſtly detained priſoner, formed a ſecret conſpiracy among the
proteſtant princes; and covering his intentions with the moſt artificial
diſguiſes, he ſuddenly march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his forces againſt Charles, and
narrowly miſſed becoming maſter of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The proteſtants flew
to arms in every quarter; and their inſurrection, aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an invaſion
from France, reduced the emperor to ſuch extremity, that he was obliged to
ſubmit to articles of peace, which enſured the independency of Germany. To
retrieve his honour, he made an attack on France; and laying ſiege to Metz,
with an army of an hundred thouſand men, he conducted the enterprize in
perſon, and ſeemed determined, at all hazards, to ſucceed in an
undertaking which had attracted the attention of all Europe. But the duke of

vigilance, conduct, and valour, that the ſiege was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to the depth

retired with the remains of his army, into the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, much dejected

and tho' he was only twenty-ſeven years of age, eleven years younger than the
Queen, this objection, it was thought, might eaſily be overlooked, and there
was no reaſon to deſpair of her having ſtill a numerous iſſue. The
emperor, therefore, immediately ſent over an agent to ſignify his
intentions to Mary, who, pleaſed with the ſupport of ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an
alliance, and glad to unite herſelf more cloſely with her mother's fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to which ſhe was ever ſtrongly attached, readily embraced the propoſal.
Norfolk, Arundel, and Paget, gave their advice for the match: And Gardiner, who
was become prime miniſter, and who had been promoted to the office of
chancellor, finding how Mary's inclinations lay, ſeconded the project of the
Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh alliance; and repreſented, both to her and the emperor, the
neceſſity of ſtopping all farther innovations in religion, till the
completion of the marriage. He obſerved, that the Parliament, amidſt all
their compliances, had diſcovered evident ſymptoms of jealouſy, and
ſeemed at preſent determined, to grant no further conceſſions in favour
of the catholic religion: That tho' they might make a ſacrifice to their
ſovereign of ſome ſpeculative principles, which they did not well
comprehend, or of ſome rites, which ſeemed not of any immediate
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, they had imbibed ſuch ſtrong prejudices againſt the
pretended uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and exactions of the court of Rome, that they would
with great difficulty be again brought to ſubmit to its authority: That the
danger of making a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the abbey lands, would alarm the nobility
and gentry, and induce them to encourage the prepoſſeſſions which were
but too general among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, againſt the doctrine and worſhip of the
catholic church: That much pains had been taken to prejudice the nation
againſt the Spaniſh alliance; and if that point was urged, at the ſame
time with further changes in religion, it would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard a general revolt and
inſurrection: That the marriage, being once compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would give authority
to the Queen's meaſures, and enable her afterwards to forward that pious
work, in which ſhe was engaged: And that it was even ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
previouſly to reconcile the people to the marriage, by rendering the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions extremely favourable to the Engliſh, and ſuch as would ſeem
to enſure to them their independency, and the entire poſſeſſion of

               <p>THE emperor, well acquainted with the prudence and experience of
Gardiner, aſſented to all theſe reaſons; and he endeavoured to temper
the zeal of Mary, by repreſenting the neceſſity of proceeding gradually
in the great work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the nation. Hearing that cardinal Pole, more
ſincere in his religious opinions, and leſs guided by the maxims of civil
policy, after having ſent oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite <pb n="360" facs="tcp:0429000101:364"/> advice to the
Queen, had ſet out on his journey to England, where he was to exerciſe his
legantine commiſſion; he thought proper to ſtop him at Dilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen, a
town on the Danube; and he afterwards obtained Mary's conſent for this
detention. The negociation for the marriage mean-while proceeded apace; and
Mary's intentions to eſpouſe Philip became generally known to the nation.
The commons, who hoped that they had gained the Queen by the conceſſions
which they had already made, were alarmed to hear, that ſhe was reſolved to
contract a<note place="margin">6th of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</note>foreign alliance; and they
ſent a committee to remonſtrate againſt that dangerous meaſure. To
prevent farther applications of the ſame kind, ſhe thought proper to
diſſolve them.</p>
               <p>A CONVOCATION had been ſummoned at the ſame time with the
Parliament; and the majority here alſo appeared to be of the court religion.
An offer was very frankly made by the Romaniſts, to diſpute concerning the
points controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the two communions; and as tranſubſtantiation
was the article which, of all others, they eſteemed the cleareſt, and
founded on the moſt irreſiſtible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, they choſe to try their
ſtrength by defending it. The proteſtants puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diſpute as far as
the clamour and noiſe of their antagoniſts would permit; and they fondly
imagined, that they had obtained ſome advantage, when, in the courſe of the
debate, they obliged the catholics to avow, that, according to their doctrine,
Chriſt had, in his laſt ſupper, held himſelf in his hand, and had
ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and eat himſelf<note n="*" place="bottom">Collier, vol. II. p.
356. Fox, vol. III. p. 22.</note>. This triumph, however, was confined only to
their own party: The Romaniſts maintained, that their champions had clearly
the better of the day; that their adverſaries were blind and obſtinate
heretics; that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the moſt extreme depravity of heart could induce
men to diſpute ſuch ſelf-evident principles; and that the ſevereſt
puniſhments were due to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe wickedneſs. So pleaſed were
they with their ſuperiority in this favorite point, that they ſoon after
renewed the diſpute at Oxford; and to ſhow, that they feared no force of
learning or capacity, where reaſon was ſo evidently on their ſide, they
ſent thither Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley, under a guard, to try whether
theſe renowned controverſialiſts could find any appearance of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to defend their baffled principles<note n="†" place="bottom">Mem. of

diffuſed univerſal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions for the liberty and independance of the
nation. To obviate all cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, the articles of marriage were drawn as
favourable as poſſible for the intereſt and ſecurity, and even grandeur
of England. It was agreed, that tho' Philip ſhould have the title of King,
the adminiſtration ſhould be entirely in the Queen; that no foreigner
ſhould be capable of enjoying any office in the kingdom; that no innovation
ſhould be made in the Engliſh laws, cuſtoms and privileges; that Philip
ſhould not carry the Queen abroad without her conſent, nor any of her
children without the conſent of the nobility; that ſixty thouſand pounds
a year ſhould be ſettled on her as her jointure; that the male iſſue of
this marriage ſhould inherit, together with England, both Burgundy and the
Low Countries; and that, if Don Carlos, Philip's ſon by his former marriage,
ſhould die and his line be extinct, the Queen's iſſue, whether male or

<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0429000101:366"/> conditions which he granted, the more certainly might it
be concluded, that he had no ſerious intention of obſerving them: That the
uſual fraud and ambition of that monarch might aſſure the nation of
ſuch a conduct; and his ſon Philip, while he inherited theſe vices from
his father, added to them tyranny, ſullenneſs, pride, and barbarity, more
dangerous vices of his own: That England would become a province, and a
province to a kingdom which uſually exerciſed the moſt violent authority
over all her dependant dominions: That the Netherlands, Milan, Sicily, Naples
groaned under the burthen of Spaniſh tyranny; and throughout all the new
conqueſts in America there had been diſplayed ſcenes of unrelenting
cruelty, hitherto unknown in the hiſtory of mankind: That the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
was a tribunal invented by that tyrannical nation; and would infallibly, with
all their other laws and inſtitutions, be introduced into England: And that
the divided ſentiments of the people with regard to religion would ſubject
mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes to this iniquitous tribunal, and would reduce the whole nation to
the moſt abject ſervitude<note n="*" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 32. Burnet,

               <p>THESE complaints, being diffuſed thro' the whole people,
prepared the nation for a rebellion; and had any foreign power given them
encouragement, or any great man appeared to head them; the conſequences might
have proved fatal to the Queen's authority. But the King of France, tho'
engaged in hoſtilities with the emperor, refuſed to concur in any
propoſal for an inſurrection; leſt he ſhould afford Mary a pretence for
declaring war againſt him. And the more prudent part of the nobility thought,
that, as the evils of the Spaniſh alliance were only dreaded at a diſtance,
matters were not yet fully prepared for a general revolt. Some perſons,
however, more turbulent than the reſt, believed, that it would be ſafer to
prevent than to redreſs grievances; and they framed a conſpiracy to
riſe<note place="margin">Wiat's inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</note>in arms, and declare
againſt the Queen's marriage with Philip. Sir Thomas Wiat propoſed to
raiſe Kent, Sir Peter Carew, Devonſhire; and they engaged the duke of
Suffolk, by the hopes of recovering the crown for the lady Jane, to attempt
raiſing the midland counties<note n="†" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 33.
Godwin, p. 340.</note>. Carew's impatience or apprehenſions engaged him to
break the concert, and to riſe in arms before the day appointed: He was
ſoon ſuppreſſed by the earl of Bedford, and obliged to fly into France.
On this intelligence, Suffolk, dreading an arreſt, ſuddenly left the town,
with his brothers, the lord Thomas, and lord Leonard Gray; and endeavoured to
raiſe the people in the counties of Warwic and Leiceſter; where his
intereſt lay: But he was ſo cloſely followed by the earl of Huntingdon,
at the head of 300 horſe, that he was obliged to diſperſe his retainers,
and being diſcovered in his retreat, he was <pb n="363" facs="tcp:0429000101:367"/> led
priſoner to London<note n="‡" place="bottom">Fox, vol. III. p.
30.</note>. Wiat was at firſt more ſucceſsful in his attempt; and having
publiſhed a declaration at Maidſtone in Kent, againſt the Queen's evil
counſellors and againſt the Spaniſh match, without any mention of
religion, the people began to gather under his ſtandard. The duke of Norfolk
with Sir Henry Jernegan was ſent againſt him, at the head of the guards and
ſome other troops, reinforced with 500 Londoners commanded by Bret: And he
came within ſight of the rebels at Rocheſter, where they had fixed their
head quarters. Sir George Harper here pretended to deſert from them; but
having ſecretly gained Bret, theſe two perſons ſo wrought on the
Londoners, that that whole body deſerted to Wiat, and declared that they
would not contribute to enſlave their native country. Norfolk, dreading the
contagion of this example, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately retreated with his troops and took
ſhelter in London<note n="*" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 33. Godwin, p. 341.

               <p>AFTER this proof of the diſpoſitions of the people,
eſpecially of the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners, who were moſtly proteſtants, Wiat was
encouraged to proceed; and he led his forces to Southwark, where he required of
the Queen, that ſhe ſhould put the Tower into his hands, ſhould deliver

nation, immediately marry an Engliſhman. Finding that the bridge was

Kingſton, where he paſſed the river with 4000 men; and returning towards
London, hoped to encourage his partizans, who had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to declare for him.

Wiat was condemned and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; and as it had been reported, that, at his

he took care on the ſcaffold, before the whole people, fully to acquit them

               <p>THE lady Elizabeth had been, during ſome time, treated with
great harſhneſs by her ſiſter; and many ſtudies inſtances of
diſcouragement and diſreſpect had been practiſed againſt her. She was
ordered to take place at court after the counteſs of L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

legitimate, of the <pb n="364" facs="tcp:0429000101:368"/> royal blood: Her friends were
diſcountenanced on every occaſion: And while her virtues, which were now
become very eminent, drew to her the attendance of all the young nobility, and
rendered her the favourite of the nation, the malevolence of the Queen ſtill
diſcovered itſelf every day by freſh ſymptoms, and obliged the
princeſs to retire into the country. Mary ſeized the opportunity of this
rebellion; and hoping to involve her ſiſter in ſome appearance of guilt,
ſent for her under a ſtrong guard, committed her to the Tower, and ordered
her to be very ſtrictly examined by the council. But the public declaration
made by Wiat rendered it impracticable to employ againſt her any falſe
evidence, which might have offered; and the princeſs made ſo good a
defence, that the Queen found herſelf under a neceſſity of
diſmiſſing her<note n="*" place="bottom">Godwin, p. 343. Burnet, vol. II.

order to ſend her out of the kingdom, a marriage was propoſed to her with
the duke of Savoy; and when ſhe declined giving her conſent, ſhe was
committed to cuſtody, under a very ſtrong guard, at Wodeſtoke. The earl
of Devonſhire, tho' equally inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, was confined in Fortheringay
caſtle.</p>
               <p>BUT this rebellion proved ſtill more fatal to the lady Jane
Gray, as well as to her huſband: The duke of Suffolk's guilt was imputed to
her; and tho' the inſurgents and malecontents ſeemed chiefly to reſt
their hopes on the lady Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth and the earl of Devonſhire, the Queen,
incapable of generoſity or clemency, was determined to remove every perſon,
from whom the leaſt danger could be apprehended. Warning was given the lady
Jane to prepare for death; a doom which ſhe had long expected, and which the
innocence of her life, as well as the misfortunes to which ſhe had been
expoſed, rendered no unwelcome news to her. The Queen's bigotted zeal, under
colour of tender mercy to the priſoner's ſoul, induced her to ſend
divines, who moleſted her with perpetual diſputation; and even a reprieve
of three days was granted her, in hopes that ſhe would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded,
during that time, to pay, by a timely converſion, ſome regard to her
eternal welfare. The lady Jane had preſence of mind, in thoſe melancholy
cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, not only to deſend her religion by all the topics then in
uſe, but alſo to write a letter to her ſiſter<note n="†" place="bottom">Fox, vol. III. p. 35. Heylin, p. 166.</note>in the Greek language;
in which, beſides ſending her a copy of the ſcriptures in that tongue,
ſhe exhorted her to maintain, in every<note place="margin">12th
February</note>fortune, a like ſteddy perſeverance. On the day of her
execution, her huſband, the lord Guilford, deſired permiſſion to ſee
her; but ſhe refuſed her conſent, and ſent him word, that the
tenderneſs of their parting would overcome the fortitude of both, and would
too much unbend their minds from that conſtancy, which their approaching end
required of them: Their ſeparation, ſhe ſaid, would be 
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0429000101:369"/> only for a moment; and they would ſoon rejoin each
other in a ſcene, where their affections would be for ever united, and where

               <p>IT had been intended to execute the lady Jane and lord Guilford

heard of the conſtancy of his end, than ſhaken by ſo tender and
melancholy a ſpectacle. Sir John Gage, conſtable of the Tower, when he led
her to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, deſired her to beſtow on him ſome ſmall preſent,
which he might keep as a perpetual memorial of her: She gave him her
table-book, where ſhe had juſt wrote three ſentences on ſeeing her
huſband's dead body; one in Greek, another in Latin, a third in
Engliſh<note n="*" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 167.</note>. The purport of them
was, that human juſtice was againſt his body, but the divine mercy would be
favourable to his ſoul; and that if her fault deſerved puniſhment, her
youth at leaſt, and her imprudence were worthy of excuſe; and that God and
poſterity, ſhe truſted, would ſhow her favour. On the ſcaffold, ſhe
made a ſpeech to the bye-ſtanders, where the mildneſs of her
diſpoſition led her to take the blame entirely on herſelf, without
uttering one complaint againſt the ſeverity, with which ſhe had been
treated. She ſaid, that her offence was not the having laid her hand upon the
crown, but the not rejecting it with ſufficient conſtancy: That ſhe had
leſs erred thro' am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition than thro' reverence to her parents, whom ſhe
had been taught to reſpect and obey: That ſhe willingly received death, as
the only ſatisfaction which ſhe could now make to the injured ſtate; and
tho' her infringement of the laws had been conſtrained, ſhe would ſhow,
by her voluntary ſubmiſſion to their ſentence, that ſhe was
deſirous to attone for that diſobedience, into which too much ſilial
piety had betrayed her: That ſhe had juſtly deſerved this puniſhment
for being made the inſtrument, tho' the unwilling inſtrument, of the
ambition of others: And that the ſtory of her life, ſhe hoped, might at
leaſt be uſeful, by proving that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence excuſes not great miſdeeds,
if they tend any way to the deſtruction of the commonwealth. After uttering
theſe words, ſhe cauſed herſelf to be diſrobed by her women; and with

Gray loſt his life for the ſame crime. Sir Nicholas Throcmorton was tried

was able, by making an admirable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to obtain a verdict of the jury in
his favour. The Queen was ſo enraged at this diſappointment, that,
inſtead of releaſing him as the law required, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>committed him to the
Tower, and kept him in cloſe confinement during ſome years. But her

ſeveral, among others to Sir John Throcmorton, brother to Sir Nicholas, who

ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of her ſuſpicion. And finding, that ſhe was become extremely
odious to the nation, ſhe was reſolved to diſable them from
reſiſtance, by ordering general muſters, and directing the
commiſſioners to ſeize their arms, and lay them up in forts and
caſtles.</p>
               <p>THO' the government laboured under ſo general an odium, the
Queen's autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity had received ſuch an increaſe from the ſuppreſſion
of Wiat's rebellion, that the miniſtry hoped to find a very compliant
diſpoſition in the new Parliament, which was ſummoned to aſſemble.
The emperor alſo, in order to facilitate the<note place="margin">A Parliament.
5th April.</note>ſame end, had borrowed no leſs a ſum than 400,000 pounds
which he had ſent over to England, to be diſtributed in bribes and
penſions among the members: A pernicious practice, of which there had not
hitherto been any inſtance in England. And not to give the public any alarm
with regard to the church lands, the Queen, notwithſtanding her bigotry,
reſumed her legal title of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme head of the church, which ſhe had
dropped three months before. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, the chancellor, opened the
ſeſſion by a ſpeech; in which he aſſerted the Queen's hereditary
title to the crown; maintained her right to chooſe a huſband for herſelf;
he obſerved how proper an uſe ſhe had made of that right, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
an old ally, deſcended from the houſe of Burgundy; and remarked the failure
of Henry the eighth's poſterity, of whom there now remained none but the
Queen and the lady Elizabeth. He added, that, in order to obviate the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, <pb n="367" facs="tcp:0429000101:371"/> conveniences, which might ariſe from
different pretenders, it was neceſſary to inveſt the Queen, by law, with
a power of diſpoſing of the crown, and of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing her ſucceſſor:
A power, he ſaid, which was not to be regarded as a new thing in England,
ſince it had formerly been conferred on Henry the eighth<note n="†" place="bottom">Carte, vol. III. p. 310, from Ambaſſ. de

               <p>THE Parliament were much diſpoſed to gratify the Queen in
all her deſires; but when the liberty, independency, and very being of the
nation were brought into ſuch viſible danger, they could not by any means
be brought to compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. They knew both the inveterate hatred which ſhe
bore the lady Elizabeth, and her devoted attachment to the houſe of
Auſtria: They were acquainted with her extreme bigotry, which would lead her
to poſtpone all conſiderations of juſtice or national intereſt to the
eſtabliſhment of the catholic religion: They remarked, that Gardiner had
carefully avoided, in his ſpeech, the giving to Elizabeth the appellation of
the Queen's ſiſter; and they thence concluded, that a deſign was formed
of excluding her as illegitimate: They expected, that Mary, if inveſted with
ſuch a power as ſhe required, would make a will in her huſband's favour,
and thereby render England for ever a province of the Spaniſh monarchy: And
they were the more alarmed with theſe projects, when they heard, that
Philip's deſcent from the houſe of Lancaſter was carefully inſiſted
on, and that he was publickly repreſented as the true and only heir by right
of inheritance.</p>
               <p>THE Parliament, therefore, aware of their danger, were
determined to keep at a diſtance from the precipice, which lay before them.
They could not avoid ratifying the articles of marriage<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Mar. P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

favourable for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but they declined paſſing any ſuch law as the
chancellor pointed out to them: They would not ſo much as declare it
treaſon to imagine or attempt the death of the Queen's huſband, while ſhe
was alive; and a bill introduced for that purpoſe was laid aſide after the
firſt reading. The more effectually to cut off Philip's hopes of exerting any
authority in England, they paſſed a law, where they declared, 
<q rend="inline">"that her majeſty as their only Queen,
ſhould ſolely and as a ſole Queen, enjoy the crown and ſovereignty of
her realms, with all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminences, dignities, and rights thereto

exertion of her abſolute power, put Tonſtal in poſſeſſion of that
ſee: But tho' it was uſual at that time for the crown to aſſume
authority which might ſeem entirely legiſlative, it was always eſteemed
more ſafe and ſatisfactory to procure the ſanction of Parliament. Bills
were introduced for ſuppreſſing erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous opinions contained in books,
and for reviving the law of the ſix articles, together with thoſe againſt
the Lollards, againſt hereſy and erroneous preaching: But none of theſe
laws could paſs the two houſes. A proof, that the Parliament had reſerves
even in their conceſſions with regard to religion; about which they ſeem
to have been leſs ſcrupulous. The Queen, therefore, finding that they<note place="margin">5th May.</note>would not ſerve all her purpoſes, finiſhed
the ſeſſion by diſſolving them.</p>
               <p>MARY'S thoughts were now entirely employed about receiving Don
Philip, whoſe arrival ſhe hourly expected. This princeſs, who had lived
ſo many years in a very reſerved and private manner, without any proſpect
or hopes of a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, was ſo ſmit with affection for her young
ſpouſe, whom ſhe had never ſeen, that ſhe waited with the utmoſt
impatience for the completion of the marriage; and every obſtacle was to her
a ſource of anxiety and diſcontent<note n="*" place="bottom">Strype, vol.
III. p. 125.</note>. She com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of Philip's delays as affected; and ſhe
could not conceal her vexation, that, tho' ſhe brought him a kingdom for a
dowry, he treated her with ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, that he had never yet favoured her
with a ſingle letter. Her fondneſs was but the more encreaſed by this
ſupercilious treatment; and when ſhe found that her ſubjects had
entertained the greateſt averſion for the event, to which ſhe directed
her fondeſt wiſhes, ſhe made the whole Engliſh nation the object of her
reſentment. A ſquadron, under the command of lord Effingham, had been
fitted out to convoy Philip from Spain, where he then reſided; but the
admiral informing her, that the diſcontents ran very high among the ſeamen,
and that it was not ſafe for Philip to entruſt himſelf into their hands,
ſhe gave orders to diſmiſs them. She then dreaded, that the French fleet,
being maſters of the ſea, might intercept her huſband; and every rumour
of danger, every blaſt of wind, threw her into panics and convulſions. Her
health, and even her underſtanding, were viſibly impaired by this extreme
impatience; and ſhe was ſtruck with a new apprehenſion, left her
perſon, impaired by time, and blaſted by ſickneſs, ſhould render her
leſs acceptable to her future ſpouſe. Her glaſs diſcovered to her how
hagard ſhe was become, and when ſhe remarked the decay of her perſon,
ſhe knew not whether ſhe ought more to deſire or apprehend the arrival of
Philip.</p>

               <p>THE Queen ſoon found, that Philip's ruling paſſion was

her people were conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſmall moment, in compariſon of her
obtaining this favourite point. She ſummoned a new Parliament, in hopes of
finding them entirely compliant; and that ſhe might acquire the greater

to procure ſubſidies from the commons, in order to ſupport the emperor in

jealouſy of the Engliſh againſt that kingdom, ſeemed to have given
place, for the preſent, to like paſſions againſt Spain. Philip,
ſenſible of the prepoſſeſſions entertained againſt him,
endeavoured to acquire popularity, by procuring the releaſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

nothing was more agreeable to the nation than his protection of the lady

               <p>THE Queen's extreme deſire of having iſſue, had made her
fondly give credit to any appearance of her pregnancy; and when the legate was
introduced to her, ſhe fancied, that ſhe felt the embryo ſtir in her
womb. Her flatterers compared this motion of the infant to that of John the

the nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſtill ſomewhat incredulous; and men were perſuaded,
that the Queen laboured under infirmities, which rendered her incapable of
having children. Her infant proved only the commencement of a dropſy, which
the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſtate of her health had brought upon her. The belief,
however, of her pregnancy was ſtill maintained with all poſſible care;

               </argument>
               <p>THE ſucceſs which Gardiner, from his cautious and prudent
conduct, had met with in governing the Parliament, and engaging them both to
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the Spaniſh alliance, and the re-eſtabliſhment of the ancient
religion, two points, to which, it was believed, they bore an extreme
averſion, had ſo raiſed his character for wiſdom and policy, that his
opinion was received as an oracle in the Queen's councils; and his authority,
as it was always great in his own party, no longer ſuffered any oppoſition
or controul. Cardinal Pole himſelf, tho' more beloved on account of his
virtue and candour, and tho' ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in birth and ſtation, had not equal
weight in public deliberations; and while his learning, piety, and humanity
were extremely reſpected, he was repreſented more as a good man than a
great miniſter. A very important queſtion was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently debated, before
the Queen and council, by theſe two eccleſiaſtics; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the laws
lately revived againſt heretics ſhould be put in execution, or ſhould
only be employed to reſtrain, by terror, the bold attempts of theſe
zealots. Pole was very ſincere in his religious principles; and tho' his
moderation had made <pb n="374" facs="tcp:0429000101:378"/> him be ſuſpected at Rome of a
tendency towards Lutheraniſm; he was ſeriouſly perſuaded of the
catholic doctrines, and thought that no conſideration of human policy ought
ever to come in competition with ſuch important intereſts. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, on
the contrary, had always made his religion ſubſervient to his ſchemes of
ſafety or advancement; and by his unlimited complaiſance to Henry, he had
ſhown, that had he not been puſhed to extremity under the late minority, he
was ſufficiently diſpoſed to make a ſacrifice of his principles to the
eſtabliſhed theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. This was the well-known character of theſe two
great counſellors; yet ſuch is the prevalence of temper above ſyſtem,
that the benevolent diſpoſition of Pole led him to adviſe a toleration of
the heretical tenets which he highly blamed; while the ſevere manners of
Gardiner inclined him to ſupport, by perſecution, that religion which, at
the bottom, he regarded with great indifference<note n="*" place="bottom">

of public conduct was of the higheſt importance; and from being the object of
deliberation in the council, it ſoon became the ſubject of diſcourſe
throughout the nation. We ſhall repreſent, in a few words, the topics by
which each ſide ſupported, or might have ſupported, their ſcheme of
policy; and ſhall diſplay the oppoſite reaſons which have been
employed, with regard to an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that ever has been, and ever will be ſo

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons for and againſt
toleration.</note> THE practice of perſecution, ſaid the defenders of
Pole's opinion, is the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of all religion; and the theological
animoſity, ſo fierce and violent, far from being an argument of men's
conviction in their oppoſite tenets, is a certain proof, that they have never
reached any ſerious perſuaſion with regard to theſe remote and
ſublime ſubjects. Even thoſe who are the moſt impatient of
contradiction in other controverſies, are mild and moderate in compariſon
of polemical divines; and wherever a man's knowlege and experience give him a
perfect aſſurance of his own opinion, he regards with contempt, rather than
anger, the oppoſition and miſtakes of others. But while men zealouſly
maintain what they neither clearly comprehend, nor entirely believe, they are
ſhaken in their imagined ſaith, by the oppoſite perſuaſion, or even
doubts of other men; and vent on their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſts that impatience which is
the natural reſult of ſo diſagreeable a ſtate of the underſtanding.

are leaſt ſubjected to <pb n="375" facs="tcp:0429000101:379"/> the criterion of human

religious ſubjects, can only be owing at firſt to the ſtupid igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and barbariſm of the people, who never indulge themſelves in any

ineffectual to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe intended; and ſerves only to make men more

maxim of toleration, it will only be where a theology altogether new, no way
connected with the ancient religion of the ſtate, is imported from foreign
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and may eaſily, at one blow, be eradicated, without leaving the
ſeeds of future innovations. But as this inſtance would involve ſome
apology for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient pagan perſecutions, or for the extirpation of
Chriſtianity in China and Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan; it ought ſurely, on account of this
deteſted conſequence, to be rather bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in eternal ſilence and
oblivion.</p>
               <p>THO' theſe arguments appear entirely ſatisfactory, yet
ſuch is the ſubtilty of human wit, that Gardiner, and the other enemies to
toleration, were not reduced to ſilence, and they ſtill found topics on
which to ſupport the controverſy. The doctrine, ſaid they, of liberty of
conſcience is founded on the moſt flagrant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, and ſuppoſes
ſuch an indifference among all religions, ſuch an obſcurity in
theological doctrines, as to render the church and magiſtrate incapable of
diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, with certainty, the dictates of Heaven from the mere
fictions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man imagination. If the Divinity reveals principles to mankind,
he will ſurely give a criterion by which they may be aſcertained; and a
prince, who knowingly allows theſe principles to be perverted, or
adulterated, is infinitely more criminal than if he gave permiſſion for the
vending of poiſon, under the ſhape of bread, to all his ſubjects.
Perſecution may, indeed, ſeem better calculated to make hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites than
converts; but experience teaches us, that the habits of hypocriſy often turn
into reality; and the children at leaſt, ignorant of their parents
diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, may happily be educated in more orthodox tenets. It is
abſurd, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to conſiderations of ſuch unſpeakable
importance, to plead the temporal and frivolous intereſts of civil ſociety;
and if matters be thoroughly examined, even that topic will not appear ſo
certain and univerſal in favour of toleration as by ſome i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

perſecutors began with Rogers, who was prebendary of St. Paul's, and a man
eminent in his party for virtue as well as for learning. Gardiner's plan was
firſt to attack men of that character, whom, he hoped, terror would bend to
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and whoſe example, either of puniſhment or recantation,
would natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have influence on the multitude: But he found a perſeverance
and courage in Rogers, which it may ſeem ſtrange to find in human nature,
and of which all ages, and all ſects, do notwithſtanding furniſh many
examples. Rogers, beſide the care of his own preſervation, lay under other
very powerful temptations to compliance: He had a wife, whom he tenderly loved,
and ten children; yet ſuch was his ſerenity after his condemnation, that
the jailors, it is ſaid, waked him from a ſound ſleep, when the hour of
his execution approached. He had deſired to ſee his wiſe before he died;
but Gardiner told him, that he was a prieſt; he could not poſſibly have a
wife: Thus joining inſult to cruelty. Rogers was burnt in Smithfield<note n="†" place="bottom">Fox, vol. III. p. 119. Burnet, vol. II. p.

               <p>HOOPER, biſhop of Gloceſter, had been tried at the ſame
time with Rogers; but was ſent to his own dioceſe to be executed. This
circumſtance was contrived to <pb n="378" facs="tcp:0429000101:382"/> ſtrike a greater
terror into his flock; but it was a ſource of ſatisfaction to Hooper, who
rejoiced in giving teſtimony, by his death, to that doctrine which he had
formerly taught them. When he was tied to the ſtake, a ſtool was ſet
before him, and the Queen's pardon laid upon it, which it was ſtill in his
power to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by his recantation: But he ordered it to be removed; and
chearfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared himſelf for that dreadful puniſhment to which he was
condemned. He ſuffered it in its full ſeverity: The wind, which was
vehement, blew the flame of the reeds from his body: The faggots were green,
and did not kindle eaſily: All his lower parts were conſumed before his
vitals were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked: One of his hands dropt off: With the other he continued
to beat his breaſt: He was heard to pray and exhort the people, till his
tongue, ſwoln with the violence of the agony, could no longer permit him
utterance. He was three quarters of an hour in torture, which he bore with
inflexible conſtancy<note n="‡" place="bottom">Fox, vol. III. p. 145,

               <p>SANDERS was burned at Coventry: A pardon was alſo offered him;
but he rejected it, and embraced the ſtake, ſaying, 
<q rend="inline">"Welcome the croſs of Chriſt; welcome
everlaſting life."</q> Taylor, parſon of Hadley, was conſumed by flames
in that place, amidſt his ancient friends and pariſhioners. When tied to
the ſtake, he repeated a pſalm in Engliſh: One of his guards ſtruck him
on the mouth, and bid him ſpeak Latin: Another, in a rage, gave him a blow on
the head with his halbert, which happily put an end to his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>torments.</p>
               <p>THERE was one Philpot, archdeacon of Wincheſter,
poſſeſſed of ſuch zeal for orthodoxy, that having been engaged in a
diſpute with an Arian, he ſpit in his adverſary's face, to ſhow the
great deteſtation which he had entertained againſt that hereſy. He
afterwards wrote a treatiſe to juſtify this unmannerly expreſſion of
zeal; and he ſaid, that he was led to it, in order to relieve the ſorrow
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from ſuch horrid blaſphemy, and to ſignify how unworthy ſuch
a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant was of being admitted into the company of any chriſtian<note n="‖" place="bottom">Strype, vol. III. p. 261. and Coll. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 58.</note>. Philpot was a
proteſtant; and falling now into the hands of people as zealous as himſelf,
but more powerful, he was condemned to the flames, and ſuffered at
Smithfield.</p>
               <p>THE article upon which almoſt all the proteſtants were
condemned, was, their refuſal to acknowlege the real preſence. Gardiner,
who had vainly expected, that a few examples would ſtrike a terror into the
reformers, finding the work daily multiply upon him, devolved the invidious
office on others, chiefly on Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, a man of profligate manners, and of a
brutal character, who ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the torments of the unhappy
ſufferers<note n="*" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 47, 48.</note>. He ſometimes
whipped the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners <pb n="379" facs="tcp:0429000101:383"/> ſoners with his own hands,
till he was tired with the violence of the exerciſe: He tore out the beard of

               <p>IT is needleſs to be particular in enumerating all the horrid
cruelties practiſed in England during the courſe of three years that
theſe perſecutions laſted: The ſavage barbarity on the one hand, and
the patient conſtancy on the other, are ſo ſimilar in all theſe
martyrdoms, that the narration, very little agreeable in itſelf, would never
be relieved by any variety. Human nature appears not, on any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, ſo
deteſtable, and at the ſame time ſo abſurd, as in theſe religious
perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which ſink men below infernal ſpirits in wickedneſs, and
below the beaſts in folly. A few inſtances only may be worth preſerving,
in order, if poſſible, to warn zealous bigots, for ever to avoid ſuch
odious and ſuch fruitleſs barbarity.</p>
               <p>FERRAR, biſhop of St. David's, was burned in his own
dioceſe; and his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to cardinal Pole was not attended to<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 216.</note>. Ridley, biſhop of London, and
Latimer, formerly biſhop of Worceſter, two prelates celebrated for learning
and virtue, periſhed together in the ſame flames at Oxford, and ſupported
each other's conſtancy by their mutual exhortations. Latimer, when tied to
the ſtake, called to his companion, 
<q rend="inline">"Be of good comfort, brother, we ſhall this
day kindle ſuch a torch in England, as, I truſt in God, ſhall never be
extinguiſhed."</q> The executioners had been ſo merciful (for that clemency
may more naturally be aſcribed to them than to the religious zealots) as to
tye bags of gunpowder about theſe prelates, in order to put a ſpeedy period
to their tortures: The exploſion imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately killed Latimer, who was in an
extreme old age: Ridley continued alive during ſome time in the midſt of
the flames<note n="‖" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. II. p. 318. Heylin, p.

               <p>ONE Hunter, a young man of nineteen, an apprentice, having been
ſeduced by a prieſt into a diſpute, had unwarily denied the real
preſence. Senſible of his danger, he immediately concealed himſelf; and
Bonner laying hold of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, threatened him with the greateſt
ſeve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ties, if he did not produce
the young man to ſtand his tryal. Hunter, hearing the vexations to which his
father was expoſed, voluntarily delivered himſelf to Bonner, and was
condemned to the flames by that barbarous prelate.</p>
               <p>THOMAS Haukes, when conducted to the ſtake, agreed with his
friends, that if he found the torture tolerable, he would make them a ſignal
to that purpoſe in the midſt of the flames. His zeal for the cauſe in
which he ſuffered, ſo ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that he ſtretched out his arms,
the ſignal agreed on; and in that poſture <pb n="380" facs="tcp:0429000101:384"/> he
expired<note n="*" place="bottom">Fox, vol. III. p. 265.</note>. This example,
with many others of like conſtancy, encouraged multitudes, not only to
ſuffer, but even to aſpire to martyrdom.</p>
               <p>THE tender ſex itſelf, as they have commonly a greater
propenſity to religion, produced many inſtances of the moſt inflexible
courage in ſupporting the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, againſt all the fury of
the perſecutors. One execution in particular was attended with
circumſtances which, even at that time, excited aſtoniſhment, by reaſon
of their unuſual barbarity. A woman in Guernſey, being near the time of her
labour when brought to the ſtake, was thrown into ſuch agitation by the
torture, that her belly burſt, and ſhe was delivered in the midſt of the
flames. One of the guards immediately ſnatched the infant from the fire, and
attempted to ſave it: But a magiſtrate who ſtood by, ordered it to be
thrown back; being determined, he ſaid, that nothing ſhould ſurvive which
ſprung from ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and heretical parent<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 747. Heylin, p 57. Burnet, vol. II. p. 337.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE perſons condemned to theſe puniſhments were not
convicted for teaching, or dogmatizing, contrary to the eſtabliſhed
religion: They were ſeized merely on ſuſpicion; and articles being
offered them to ſubſcribe, they were immediately, upon their refuſal,
condemned to the flames<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 306.</note>.
Thoſe inſtances of barbarity, ſo unuſual in the nation, excited horror;
the conſtancy of the martyrs was the object of admiration; and as men have a
principle of equity engraven in their minds, which even falſe religion is not
able totally to obliterate, they were ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee perſons of probity,
of honour, of pious diſpoſitions, expoſed to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments more ſevere
than were inflicted on the greateſt ruffians, for crimes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of
civil ſociety. To exterminate the whole proteſtant party, was known to be
impoſſible; and nothing could appear more iniquitous, than to ſubject to
torture, the moſt conſcientious and courageous among them; and allow the
cowards and hypocrites to eſcape. Each martyrdom, therefore, was equivalent
to a hundred ſermons againſt popery; and men either avoided ſuch horrid
ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles, or returned from them full of a violent, tho' ſecret,
indignation againſt the perſecutors. Repeated orders were ſent from the
council, to quicken the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the magiſtrates in ſearching after
heretics; and, in ſome places, the gentry were obliged to countenance, by
their preſence, theſe barbarous executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The violences tended only to
render the Spaniſh government daily more odious; and Philip, ſenſible of
the hatred which he incurred, endeavoured to remove the reproach from himſelf
by a very groſs artifice: He ordered his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Spaniſh friar<note n="‖" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 56.</note>. But the
court, finding that Bonner, however ſhameleſs and ſavage, would not bear
alone the whole infamy, ſoon threw off the maſk; and the unrelenting temper
of the Queen, as well as of the King, appeared without controul. A bold ſtep
was even taken towards the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the inquiſition into England. As
the biſhops' courts, tho' extremely arbitrary, and not bound by any ordinary
forms of law, appeared not to be inveſted with ſufficient power, a
commiſſion was appointed by authority of the Queen's prerogative, more
effectually to extirpate hereſy. Twenty-one perſons were named; but any
three were armed with the powers of the whole. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion runs in
theſe terms; 
<q rend="inline">"That ſince many falſe rumours were
publiſhed among the ſubjects, and many heretical opinions were alſo
ſpread among them, therefore they were to enquire into thoſe, either by
preſentments by witneſſes, or any other political way they could

the readers of all heretical books: They were to examine and puniſh all
miſbehaviours or negligences, in any church or chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and to try all
prieſts that did not preach the ſacrament of the altar; all perſons that
did not hear maſs, or come to their pariſh church to ſervice, that would
not go in proceſſions, or did not take holy bread or holy water: And if
they found any that did obſtinately perſiſt in ſuch hereſies, they
were to put them into the hands of their ordinaries, to be puniſhed according
to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual laws: Giving the commiſſioners full power to proceed,
as their diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and conſciences ſhould direct them, and to uſe
all ſuch means as they would invent for the ſearching of the premiſes;
empowering them alſo to call before them ſuch witneſſes as they
pleaſed, and to force them to make oath of ſuch things as might diſcover
what they ſought after<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. II. Coll.

puniſh vagabonds and quarrelſome perſons.</p>
               <p>TO bring the methods of proceeding in England nearer the

this tyrannical edict even exceeded the oppreſſion of the inquiſition; by
introducing into every part of government, the ſame iniquities which that
tribunal practiſes only for the extirpation of hereſy, and which are, in
ſome meaſure, neceſſary, wherever that end is earneſtly
purſued.</p>
               <p>BUT the court had deviſed a more expeditious and ſummary
method of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing hereſy than even the inquiſition itſelf.
They iſſued a proclamation againſt books of hereſy, treaſon, and
ſedition; and declared, 
<q rend="inline">"That whoſoever had any of theſe books, and
did not preſently burn them, without reading them, or ſhewing them to any
other perſon, ſhould be eſteemed rebels; and without any farther delay,
be executed by martial law<note n="‖" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. II. p.

during that period, it is not ſo much the illegality of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
as their violence and their pernicious tendency, which ought to be the object
of our cenſure.</p>
               <p>WE have thrown together almoſt the whole tranſactions
againſt heretics, tho' carried on during a courſe of three years; that we
may be obliged, as little as poſſible, to return to ſuch ſhocking
violences and barbarities. It is computed, that in that time two hundred and
ſeventy-ſeven perſons ſuffered by fire; beſides thoſe puniſhed by

biſhops, twenty-one clergymen, eight lay gentlemen, eighty-four tradeſmen,
one hundred huſbandmen, ſervants, and labourers, fifty-five women, and four
children. This perſevering cruelty appears aſtoniſhing; yet is it much
inferior to what has been practiſed in other countries. A great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor<note n="*" place="bottom">Father Paul, lib<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.</note>computes, that in the Low
Countries alone, from the time that the edict of Charles the fifth was
promulgated againſt the reformers, there had been fifty thouſand perſons
hanged, beheaded, buried alive, or burnt, on account of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; 
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0429000101:387"/> and that in France the number had alſo been
conſiderable. Yet in both countries, as the ſame author ſubjoins, the
progreſs of the new opinions, inſtead of being checked, was rather
forwarded by theſe perſecutions.</p>
               <p>THE burning of heretics was a very natural method of reconciling
the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the church of Rome, and little ſollicitation was requiſite
to engage the pope to receive the ſtrayed flock, from which he reaped ſuch
profit: Yet was there a ſolemn embaſſy ſent to Rome, conſiſting of
Sir Anthony Brown, created viſcount Montacute, the biſhop of Ely, and Sir
Edward Carne; in order to carry the ſubmiſſion of England, and beg to be
readmitted into the boſom of the catholic church<note n="*" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 45.</note>. Paul the fourth, after a ſhort interval,
now filled the papal chair; the moſt haughty pontiff, that during ſeveral
ages had been elevated to that dignity. He was offended, that Mary ſtill
retained among her titles, that of Queen of Ireland; and he affirmed that it
belonged to him alone, as he ſaw proper, either to erect new kingdoms or
aboliſh the old: But to avoid all diſpute with the new converts, he thought
proper to erect Ireland into a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and then admitted the title, as if it
had been his own conceſſion. This was an uſual artifice of the popes to
give allowance to what they could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent<note n="†" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 45. Father Paul, lib. 5.</note>, and then pretend, that
perſons, while they exerciſed their own power, were only acting by
authority from the papacy. And tho' Paul had at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to oblige
Mary formally to recede from this title, before he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it upon her;
he found it wiſer to proceed in a more political, and leſs haughty
manner<note n="‡" place="bottom">Father Paul, lib 5</note>.</p>
               <p>THE other point of diſcuſſion between the pope and the
Engliſh ambaſſadors was not ſo eaſily terminated. Paul inſiſted,
that the property and poſſeſſions of the church ſhould be reſtored
even to the uttermoſt farthing: That whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to God, could never
by any law be converted to profane uſes, and every perſon who detained
ſuch poſſeſſions was in a ſtate of eternal damnation: That he would
willingly, in conſideration of the humble ſubmiſſions of England, make
them a preſent of theſe eccleſiaſtical revenues; but ſuch a
conceſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his power, and the people might be certain that ſo
great a profanation of holy things would be a perpetual anathema upon them, and
would blaſt all their future felicity: That if they would truly ſhow their
filial piety, they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore all the privileges and emoluments of the
Roman church, and Peter's pence among the reſt; nor could they expect, that
that apoſtle would open to them the gates of Paradiſe, while they detained
from them his poſſeſſions on earth<note n="§" place="bottom">Father
Paul, lib. 5. Heylin, p. 45.</note>. <pb n="384" facs="tcp:0429000101:388"/> Theſe earneſt
remonſtrances being tranſmitted to England, tho' they had little influence
on the nation, operated powerfully on the Queen; and ſhe was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, in
order to eaſe her conſcience, to reſtore all the church lands which were
ſtill in the poſſeſſion of the crown; and the more to expreſs her
zeal, ſhe erected anew ſome convents and monaſteries, notwithſtanding
the low condition of the public revenues. When this meaſure was debated in
council, ſome members objected, that if ſuch a conſiderable part of the
revenue was diſmembered, the dignity of the crown would fall to decay: But
the Queen replied, that ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the ſalvation of her ſoul to ten
ſuch kingdoms as England<note n="†" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 53, 65.

would not probably have taken place ſo eaſily, had it not been for the
death of Gardiner, which happened about this time: The ſeals were given to
Heathe, archbiſhop of York; that an eccleſiaſtic might ſtill be

Parliament rejected a bill for obliging the exiles to return under certain
penalties, and another for incapacitating ſuch as were remiſs in the
proſecution of hereſy from being juſtices of peace. The Queen
finding<note place="margin">9th Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note>the intractable humour of the

               <p>THE ſpirit of oppoſition, which began to prevail in
Parliament, was likely to be the more vexatious to Mary, as ſhe was
otherwiſe in very bad humour on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her huſband's abſence, who,
tired of her importunate love and jealouſy, and finding his authority
extremely limited in England, had laid hold of the firſt opportunity to leave
her, and had gone over laſt ſummer to the emperor in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The
indifference and neglect of her huſband, added to the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in
her imagined pregnancy, threw her into a deep melancholy; and ſhe 
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0429000101:389"/> gave vent to her ſpleen by enforcing daily the
perſecutions againſt the proteſtants, and even by expreſſions of rage
againſt all her ſubjects, by whom ſhe knew her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be hated, and
whoſe oppoſition, in refuſing an entire compliance with Philip, was the
cauſe, ſhe believed, why he had alienated his affections from her, and
afforded her ſo little of his company. The leſs return her love met with,
the more it increaſed; and ſhe paſſed moſt of her time in ſolitude,
where ſhe gave vent to her paſſion, either in tears, or in writing fond
epiſtles to Philip, who ſeldom returned her any anſwer, and ſcarce
deigned to counterfeit any ſentiment of love or even of gratitude towards
her. The chief part of government, to<note place="margin">The Queen's
extortions.</note>which ſhe attended, was the extorting money from her
people, in order to ſatisfy his demands; and as the Parliament had granted
her but a ſmall ſupply, ſhe had recourſe to expedients the moſt
violent and moſt irregular. She levied a loan of 60,000 pounds upon a
thouſand perſons, of whoſe compliance, either on account of their riches
or their affections to her, ſhe held herſelf beſt aſſured: But that
ſum not ſufficing, ſhe exacted a general loan of an hundred pounds
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece on every one who poſſeſſed twenty pounds a year. This grievous
impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition lay very heavy on the gentry, who were obliged, many of them, to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench their expences, and diſmiſs their ſervants, in order to enable
them to comply with her commands: And as theſe ſervants, accuſtomed to
idleneſs, and having no means of ſubſiſtance, betook themſelves very
commonly to theft and robbery, the Queen publiſhed a proclamation, by which
ſhe obliged their former maſters to take them back to their ſervice. She
levied 60,000 marks from 7000 yeomen, who had not contributed to the former
loan; and ſhe exacted 36,000 pounds more from the merchants. In order to
engage ſome Londoners to comply the more willingly with her multiplied
extortions, ſhe paſſed an edict, prohibiting, for four months, the
exporting any Engliſh cloths or kerſeys for Flande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

as had already ſent any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of cloth thither. Her rapaciouſneſs
engaged her to give endleſs diſturbance and interruption to commerce. The

               <p>PHILIP was now become maſter of all the wealth of the Indies,
and of the richeſt and moſt extenſive dominions in Europe, by the
voluntary reſignation of<note place="margin">The emperor reſigns his
crown.</note>the emperor, Charles the fifth, who, tho' ſtill in the vigour of
his age, had taken a diſguſt to the world, and was determined to ſeek, in
the tranquillity of retreat, for that happineſs, which he had in vain
purſued, amidſt the tumults of war,<note place="margin">25th
October.</note>and the reſtleſs projects of ambition. He ſummoned the
ſtates of the Low Countries; and ſeating himſelf on the throne for the
laſt time, explained to his ſubjects the reaſons of his reſignation,
abſolved them from all oaths of allegiance, and devolving his authority on
Philip, told him, that his paternal tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made him weep, when he
reflected on the burthen which he impoſed upon him<note n="†" place="bottom">Thuan. lib. XVI. c. 20.</note>. He inculcated to him the great and
only duty of a prince, the ſtudy of his people's happineſs; and
repreſented how much preferable it was to govern, by affection rather than
fear, the nations ſubjected to his dominion. The cool reflections of age now
diſcovered to him the emptineſs of his former purſuits; and he found,
that the vain ſchemes of extending his empire had been the ſource of
endleſs oppoſition and diſappointment, had kept himſelf, his
neighbours, and his ſubjects in perpetual inquietude, and had fruſtrated
the ſole end of government, the felicity of the nations committed to his
care; an object which meets with no oppoſition, and which, if ſteddily
purſued, can alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey a laſting and ſolid ſatisfaction.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1556</label> A FEW months after, he
reſigned to Philip his other dominions; and embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on board a fleet,
ſailed to Spain, and took his journey to St. Juſt, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery in
Eſtramedura, which, being ſituated in a happy climate, and amidſt the
greateſt beauties of nature, he had choſen for the place of his retreat. 
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0429000101:391"/> When he arrived at Burgos, he found, by the thinneſs
of his court, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent attendance of the Spaniſh grandees, that he
was no longer emperor; and tho' this obſervation might convince him ſtill
more of the vanity of the world, and make him more heartily deſpiſe what he
had renounced, he ſighed to find that all the former adulation and
obeiſance had been paid to his fortune, not to his perſon. With better
reaſon, was he ſtruck with the ingratitude of his ſon Philip, who allowed
him to wait a long time for the payment of the ſmall penſion which he had
reſerved; and this diſappointment in his domeſtic enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments gave him a
very ſenſible concern. He purſued however his reſolution with
inflexible conſtancy; and ſhutting himſelf up in his retreat, he exerted
ſuch ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>command, that he reſtrained even his curioſity from any
enquiry concerning the tranſactions of the world, which he had entirely
abandoned. The fencing againſt the pains and infirmities under which he
laboured, occupied a great part of his time; and during the intervals, he
employed his leiſure either in examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the controverſies of theology,
with which his age had been ſo much agitated, and which he had hitherto
conſidered only in a political light, or in imitating the works of renowned
artiſts, particularly in mechanics, of which he had always been a great
admirer and encourager. He is ſaid to have here diſcovered a propenſity
to the new doctrines; and to have frequently dropped hints of this unexpected
alteration in his ſentiments. Having amuſed himſelf with the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of clocks and watches, he thence remarked how impracticable the
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was, in which he had ſo much employed himſelf during his grandeur;
and how impoſſible that he, who never could frame two machines that would
go exactly alike, could ever be able to make all mankind concur in the ſame
belief and opinion. He ſurvived his retreat two years.</p>
               <p>THE emperor Charles had very early, in the beginning of his
reign, found the difficulty of governing ſuch diſtant dominions; and he had
made his brother Ferdinand be elected King of the Romans; with a view of his
ſucceeding to the imperial dignity, as well as to his German dominions. But
having afterwards enlarged his views, and formed plans of aggrandizing his
family, he regreted, that he muſt diſmember ſuch conſiderable ſtates;
and he endeavoured to engage Ferdinand, by the moſt tempting offers, and
moſt earneſt ſollicitations, to yield up his pretenſions in favour of
Philip. Finding his attempts fruitleſs, he had reſigned the imperial crown
with his other dignities; and Ferdinand, according to common form, applied to
the pope for his coronation. The arrogant pontiff refuſed the demand; and
pretended, that, tho', on the death of an emperor, he was obliged to crown the
prince elected, yet in the caſe of a reſignation, the right devolved to the
holy ſee, and it belonged to the pope alone to appoint an 
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0429000101:392"/> emperor. The conduct of Paul was in every thing
conformable to theſe lofty pretenſions. He thundered always in the ears of
all ambaſſadors, that he ſtood in no need of the aſſiſtance of any
prince, that he was above all pote tates of the earth, that he would not
accuſtom monarchs to pretend to a familiarity or equality with him, that it
belonged to him to alter and regulate kingdoms, that he was ſucceſſor of
thoſe who had depoſed kings and emperors, and that, rather than ſubmit to
any thing below his dignity, he would ſet fire to the four corners of the
world. He went ſo far, that at table, in the preſence of many perſons,
and even openly, in a public conſiſtory, he ſaid, that he would not admit
any Kings for his companions; they were all his ſubjects, and he would hold
them under theſe feet: So ſaying, he ſtamped the ground with his old and
infirm limbs: For he was now paſt fourſcore years of age<note n="*" place="bottom">Father Paul, lib. 5.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE world could not forbear making a compariſon between
Charles the fifth, a prince, who, tho' educated amidſt wars and intrigues of
ſtate, had prevented the decline of age, and had deſcended from the throne,
in order to ſet apart an interval for thought and reflection, and a prieſt,
who in the extremity of old age exulted in his dominion, and from reſtleſs
ambition and revenge was throwing all nations into combuſtion. Paul had
entertained the moſt inveterate animoſity againſt the houſe of
Auſtria; and tho' a truce of five years had been concluded between France and
Spain, he excited Henry by his ſollicitations to break it, and promiſed to
aſſiſt him in recovering Naples and the dominions to which he laid claim
in Italy; a project which had ever proved fatal to his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. He
himſelf engaged in hoſtilities with the duke of Alva, viceroy of Naples;
and the duke of Guiſe being ſent with forces to ſupport him, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal
of war between the two crowns ſeemed almoſt inevitable. Philip, tho' leſs
warlike than his father, was no leſs ambitious; and he truſted, that by the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of the cabinet, where, he believed, his caution and ſecrecy and
prudence gave him the ſuperiority, he ſhould be able to ſubdue all his
enemies, and extend his authority and dominion. For this reaſon, as well as
from the deſire of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling his new empire, he was deſirous to maintain
peace with France; but when he found, that, without ſacrificing his honour,
it was impoſſible for him to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the hoſtile attempts of Henry, he
prepared for war with great induſtry. In order to give himſelf the more
advantage, he was deſirous to embark England in the quarrel; and tho' the
Queen was of herſelf extremely averſe to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he hoped, that the
devoted fondneſs, which, notwithſtanding repeated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his
indifference, ſhe ſtill bore him, would effectually ſecond his
applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Had the matter indeed depended ſolely on her, ſhe was
incapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting <pb n="389" facs="tcp:0429000101:393"/> her huſband's commands;
but ſhe had little weight with her council, ſtill leſs with her people;
and her government, which was every day becoming more odious, ſeemed unable
to ſupport itſelf even during the moſt profound tranquillity, much more
if a war was kindled with France, and what ſeemed an inevitable
conſequence, with Scotland, ſupported by that powerful kingdom.</p>
               <p>AN act of barbarity was this year exerciſed in England, which,
added to many other inſtances of the ſame kind, tended to render the
government extremely unpopular. Cranmer had long been detained a priſoner;
but the Queen was now<note place="margin">Execution of Cranmer.</note>determined
to bring him to puniſhment; and in order the more fully to ſatiate her
vengeance, ſhe reſolved to puniſh him for hereſy, rather than for
treaſon. He was cited by the pope to ſtand his trial at Rome; and tho' he
was known to be kept in cloſe cuſtody at Oxford, he was, upon his not
appearing, condemned as contumacious. Bonner, biſhop of London, and Thirleby
of Ely, were ſent down to Oxford to degrade him; and the former executed that
melancholy ceremony with all the joy and exultation, which ſuited his
ſavage nature<note n="*" place="bottom">Mem. of Cranm p.

Queen, not ſatisfied with the eternal damnation of Cranmer, which ſhe
believed inevitable, and with the execution of that dreadful ſentence to
which he was condemned, prompted her alſo to ſeek the ruin of his honour,
and the infamy of his name. Perſons were employed to attack him, not in the
way of diſputation, againſt which he was ſufficiently armed; but by
flattery, inſinuation and addreſs; by repreſenting the dignities to which
his character ſtill entitled him, if he would merit them by a recantation; by
giving hopes of long enjoying thoſe powerful friends, whom his beneficent
diſpoſition had attached to him during the courſe of his
proſperity<note n="†" place="bottom">Heylin, p

proſpect of thoſe tortures which awaited him; he allowed, in an unguarded
hour, the ſentiments of nature to prevail over his reſolution, and he
agreed to ſign a paper, in which he acknowledged the doctrines of the papal
ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and of the real preſence. The court, equally perſidious and
cruel, were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, that this recantation ſhould avail him nothing; and
they ſent orders, that he ſhould be required to acknowledge his errors in

to execution. Cranmer, whether, that he had received a ſecret intimation of

audience by a contrary declaration. He ſaid, that he was well apprized of the
obedience which he owed his sovereign and the laws, but this duty extended no
farther than to ſubmit patiently to their commands, and to bear without
reſiſtance whatever hardſhips they ſhould impoſe upon him: That a
ſuperior duty, the duly which he owed his Maker, obliged him to ſpeak 
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0429000101:394"/> truth on all occaſions, and not to relinquiſh, by a
baſe denial, the holy doctrine which the ſupreme being had revealed to
mankind: That there was one miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in his life, of which, above all
others, he ſeverely repented; the inſincere declaration of faith to which
he had the weakneſs to conſent, and which the fear of death alone had
extorted from him: That he took this opportunity of attoning for his error, by
a ſincere and open recantation; and was willing to ſeal with his blood that
doctrine which he firmly believed to be communicated from heaven: And that as
his hand had erred by betraying his heart, it ſhould firſt be puniſhed,
by a ſevere but juſt doom, and ſhould firſt pay the forfeit of its
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. He was thence led to the ſtake amidſt the inſults of the
catholics; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now ſummoned up all the force of his mind, he bore
their ſcorn as well as the torture of his puniſhment with ſingular
fortitude. He ſtretched out his hand, and without betraying, either by his
countenance or motions, the leaſt ſign of weakneſs or even of feeling, he
held it in the flames till it was entirely conſumed. His thoughts ſeemed
entirely occupied with reflections on his former fault; and he called aloud
ſeveral times, <hi>This hand has offended.</hi> Satisfied with that
attonement, he then diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a ſerenity in his countenance; and when the
fire attacked his body, he ſeemed to be wholly inſenſible of his outward
ſufferings, and by the force of hope and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to have collected his
mind altogether within itſelf, and to repel the fury of the flames. It is
pretended, that, after his body was conſumed, his heart was found entire and
untouched among the aſhes; an event, which, as it was the emblem of his
conſtancy, was fondly believed by the zealous proteſtants. He was
undoubtedly a man of merit; poſſeſſed of learning and capacity; and
adorned with candour, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and beneficence, and all thoſe virtues,
which were fitted to render him uſeful and amiable in ſociety. His moral
qualities procured him univerſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; and the courage of his
martyrdom, tho' he fell ſhort of the rigid inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility obſerved in many,
made him the hero of the proteſtant party<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet,

               <p>AFTER Cranmer's death, cardinal Pole, who had now taken

and as Paul, the reigning pope, was a furious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor and his perſonal

was to engage the nation in the war, which was kindled between France and
Spain; and cardinal Pole, with many other counſellors, very openly and
zealouſly oppoſed this meaſure. Beſides inſiſting on the marriage
articles, which provided againſt ſuch an attempt, they repreſented the
violence of the domeſtic factions in England, and the diſordered ſtate of
the finances; and they foreboded, that the tendency of all theſe meaſures
was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the kingdom to a total dependance on Spaniſh councils. Philip
had come to London in order to ſupport his partizans; and he told the Queen,
that, if he was not gratified in ſo reaſonable a requeſt, he never more
would ſet foot in England. This declaration heightened extremely her zeal for
promoting his intereſts, and overcoming the inflexibility of her council.
After employing other menaces of a more violent nature, ſhe threatened to
diſmiſs them all from the board, and to appoint counſellors more
obſequious; yet could ſhe not procure a vote for declaring war with France.

make this act of hoſtility, with others of a like ſecret and doubtful

ſupplies could ſcarce be expected from Parliament, conſidering the
preſent diſpoſition of the nation; and as the war would ſenſibly
diminiſh the branch of the cuſtoms, the finances, it was foreſeen, would
fall ſhort even of the ordinary charges of the government; much more, prove
unequal to the vaſt expences of war. But tho' the Queen owed great arrears to
all her ſervants, beſides the loans extorted from her ſubjects; theſe
conſiderations had no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on her, and ſhe continued to levy money in
the ſame arbitrary and violent manner, which ſhe had formerly practiſed.
She obliged the city of London to ſupply her with 60,000 pounds on her
huſband's entry; ſhe levied before the legal time the ſecond year's
ſubſidy voted by Parliament; ſhe iſſued anew many privy ſeals, by
which ſhe procured loans from her people; and having equiped 
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0429000101:396"/> a fleet, which ſhe could not victual by reaſon of
the dearneſs of proviſions, ſhe ſeized all the corn ſhe could find in
Suffolk and Norfolk, without paying any price to the owners. By all theſe
expedients, aſſiſted by the power of preſſing, ſhe levied an army
of ten thouſand men, which ſhe ſent over to the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, under the
command of the earl of Pembroke. Meanwhile, in order to prevent any
diſturbance at home, many of the moſt conſiderable gentry were thrown
into the Tower; and leſt they ſhould be known, the Spaniſh practice was
followed: They were either carried thither in the night-time, or were
hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winked and muffled by the guards who conducted them<note n="‖" place="bottom">Strype's Eccleſ. Memorials, vol. III. p. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>THE King of Spain had aſſembled together an army, which,
after the junction of the Engliſh, amounted to above ſixty thouſand
ſtrong, commanded by Philibert, duke of Savoy, one of the greateſt captains
of the age. The conſtable, Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, who commanded the French army, had
not half the number to oppoſe him. The duke of Savoy, after menacing
Mariembourg and Rocroy, ſat down ſuddenly before St. Quintin; and as the
place was weak, and ill provided of a garriſon, he expected in a few days to
become maſter of it. But the admiral Coligny, governor of the province,
thinking his honour intereſted to ſave ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a fortreſs, threw
himſelf into St. Quintin, with ſome troops of French and Scotch
genſdarmes; and by his exhortation and example animated the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to a
vigorous defence. He diſpatched a meſſenger to his uncle, the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, deſiring a ſupply of men; and that general approached the
place with his<note place="margin">10th Auguſt.</note>whole army, in order to
facilitate the entry of theſe ſuccours. But the duke of Savoy falling on
the reinforcement, committed ſuch ſlaughter upon them, that<note place="margin">Battle of St. Quintin.</note>not above five hundred men got into
the place. He next made an attack on the French army, and put them to a total
rout, killing four thouſand men, and diſperſing the reſt. In this
unfortunate action many of the chief nobility of France were either ſlain or
taken priſoners: Among the latter was the old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable himſelf, who
fighting valiantly, and reſolute to die rather than ſurvive his defeat, was
ſurrounded by the enemy, and thus fell alive into their hands. The whole
kingdom of France was thrown into conſternation. Paris was attempted to be
fortified in a hurry: And had the Spaniards preſently marched thither, it
could not fail to have fallen into their hands. But Philip was very little
enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing in his character; and he was determined firſt to take St.
Quintin, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſecure a communication with his own dominions. A very
little time, it was expected, would finiſh this enterprize; but the bravery
of Coligny ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed the ſiege ſeventeen days, which proved the
ſafety of France. Some <pb n="393" facs="tcp:0429000101:397"/> troops were levied and
aſſembled. Couriers were ſent to call the duke of Guiſe and his army
from Italy: And the French having recovered from their firſt alarm, put
themſelves in a poſture of defence. Philip, after taking Ham and
Caſtelet, found the ſeaſon ſo far advanced, that he could attempt no
farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, and he broke up his camp and retired to winter
quarters.</p>
               <p>BUT the vigilant activity of Guiſe, not ſatisfied with
ſecuring the frontiers, prompted him, in the depth of winter, to attempt an
enterprize which France, during her greateſt ſucceſſes, had always
regarded as impoſſible, and had never thought of undertaking. Calais was,
in that age, eſteemed an impregnable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; and as it was known to be
the favourite of the Engliſh nation, by whom it could eaſily be
ſuccoured, the recovery of that place by France, was conſidered as totally
deſperate. But Coligny had remarked, that, as the town of Calais was
ſurrounded with marſhes, which, during the winter, were impaſſable,
except<note place="margin">Calais taken by the French.</note>over a dyke guarded
by two caſtles, St. Agatha and Newnam bridge, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh were of late
accuſtomed, on account of the lowneſs of their finances, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs a
great part of the garriſon at the end of autumn, and to recall them in the
ſpring, at which time alone they judged their attendance neceſſary. On
this circumſtance he had founded his deſign of making a ſudden attack on
the place; he had cauſed it to be ſecretly ſurveyed by ſome engineers;
and a plan of the whole enterprize being found among his papers, it ſerved,
tho' he himſelf was made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner on the taking of St. Quintin, to
ſuggeſt the project of that undertaking, and to direct the conduct of the
duke of Guiſe.</p>

defiled towards the frontiers under various pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; and the whole being
ſuddenly aſſembled, formed an army with which the duke of Guiſe made an
unexpected march towards Calais. At the ſame time a great number of French
ſhips, being ordered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into the channel, under colour of cruizing on the
Engliſh, compoſed a fleet which made an attack by ſea on the
fortifications. The French aſſaulted St. Agatha with three thouſand
harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers; and tho' the garriſon made a vigorous defence, they were
ſoon obliged to abandon the place, and retreat towards Newnam bridge. The
ſiege of this latter place was immediately undertaken, and at the ſame time
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>leet battered the riſbank,
which guarded the entry of the harbour; and both theſe caſtles ſeemed
expoſed to imminent danger. The governor, lord Wentworth, was a brave
officer, but finding that the greater part of his weak garriſon was
encloſed in Newnam or the riſbank, he ordered them to capitulate, and to
join him in Calais, which, without their aſſiſtance, he was utterly
unable to defend. The garriſon of Newnam bridge were ſo happy as to
effectuate this purpoſe; but that of the riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank <pb n="394" facs="tcp:0429000101:398"/>
could not obtain ſuch favourable conditions, and were obliged to ſurrender
themſelves priſoners.</p>
               <p>THE duke of Guiſe, now holding the place blockaded by ſea
and land, thought himſelf ſecure of ſucceeding in his enterprize; but in
order to prevent all acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, he delayed not a moment the attack of the
place. He pointed his batteries towards the caſtle, where he made a large
breach; and having ordered Andelot, Coligny's brother, to drain the
foſſée, he commanded an aſſault, which ſucceeded, and the
French made a lodgment in the caſtle. On the night following Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth
attempted to recover this poſt; but having loſt two hundred men in a
fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious attack which he made upon it<note n="*" place="bottom">Thuan, lib. xx.
c. 2.</note>, he found his garriſon ſo weak, that he was obliged to
capitulate. Ham, and Guiſnes fell ſoon after; and thus the duke of Guiſe,
in eight days, during the depth of winter, recovered this important place, that
had coſt Edward the third a ſiege of eleven months, at the head of a
numerous army, which had that very campaign been victorious in the battle of
Creſſy. The Engliſh had held it above two hundred years; and as it gave
them, whenever they pleaſed, an entry into France, it was regarded as the
moſt important poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion belonging to the crown. The joy of the
French was extreme, as well as the glory acquired by the duke of Guiſe, who,
at the time that all Europe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined France to be ſunk by the unfortunate
battle of St. Quintin, had, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Engliſh, and their allies
the Spaniards, acquired poſſeſſion of a place which no former King of
France, even during the diſtractions of the civil wars between the houſes
of York and Lancaſter, had ever ventured to attempt. The Engliſh, on the
other hand, bereaved of this valuable fortreſs, murmured loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt
the imprudence of the Queen and her council; who, after engaging in a
fruitleſs war, for the ſake of foreign intereſts, had thus expoſed the
nation to ſo ſevere a diſgrace. A treaſury exhauſted by expences, and
burthened with debts; a people divided and dejected; a ſovereign negligent of
her people's welfare; were circumſtances which, notwithſtanding the fair
offers made by Philip, gave them ſmall hopes of recovering Calais. And as the
Scotch, inſtigated by French councils, began to move on the borders, they
were now neceſſitated rather to look to their defence at home, than to
think of foreign conqueſts.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Affairs of Scotland.</note> AFTER the peace,
which, in conſequence of King Edward's treaty with Henry, took place between
Scotland and England, the Queen-dowager, under pretence of viſiting her

with her the earls of Huntley, Sutherland, Mariſchal, and many of the
principal nobility. Her ſecret deſign was to take meaſures for engaging

and the duke d'Aumale, had uncontrouled authority in the court of France, ſhe
eaſily perſuaded Henry, and by his means the Scotch nobles, to enter into
her meaſures. Having alſo gained over Carnegy of Kinnaird, Panter, biſhop
of Roſs, and Gavin Hamilton, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendator of Kilwinning, three creatures of
the governor's, ſhe perſuaded him, by their means, to conſent to this

and when every thing was thus prepared for her purpoſe, ſhe took her
journey to Scotland, and paſſed thro' England in her way thither. Edward
received her with great reſpect and civility; tho' he could not forbear
attempting a renewal of the old treaty for his marriage with her daughter: A
marriage, he ſaid, ſo happily calculated for the tranquillity, intereſt,
and ſecurity of both kingdoms, and the only means of enſuring a durable
peace between them. For his part, he added, he never could entertain a cordial
amity for any other huſband whom ſhe ſhould chooſe; nor was it eaſy
for him to forgive a man, who, at the ſame time that he diſappointed ſo
natural an alliance, had bereaved him of a bride, to whom his affections, from
his earlieſt infancy, had been entirely engaged. The Queen eluded theſe
applications, by telling him, that if any meaſures had been taken
diſagreeable to him, they were entirely owing to the imprudence of the duke
of Somerſet, who, inſtead of employing courteſy, careſſes, and gentle
offices, the proper means of gaining a young princeſs, had had recourſe to
arms and violence, and had conſtrained the Scotch nobility to ſend their
ſovereign into France, in order to intereſt that kingdom in protecting
their liberty and independance<note n="‡" place="bottom">

               <p>WHEN the Queen-dowager arrived in Scotland, ſhe found the

many delays that he could be perſuaded to reſign his authority. But finding
that the majority of the young princeſs was approaching, and that the
Queen-dowager had gained the affections of all the principal nobility, he
thought it more prudent to ſubmit; and having ſtipulated, that he ſhould

calculated for the adminiſtration of kingdoms. D'Oiſel, a Frenchman,

aſſiſt her with his counſels in ſo delicate an undertaking as the
govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Scotland; and this man had formed a ſcheme for laying a
general tax on the kingdom, in order to ſupport a ſtanding military force,
which might at once repulſe the inroads of foreign enemies, and check the
turbulence of the Scotch nobility. But tho' ſome of the courtiers were gained
over to this project, it gave great and general diſcontent to the nation; and
the Queen-regent, after ingenuouſly confeſſing, that it would prove
pernicious to the kingdom, had the prudence to deſiſt from it, and to
truſt entirely for her ſecurity to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will and affections of her
ſubjects<note n="†" place="bottom">Keith, p. 70. Buchan. lib.
xvi.</note>.</p>
               <p>THIS laudable purpoſe ſeemed to be the chief object of her
adminiſtration; yet was ſhe ſometimes drawn from it by her connections
with France, and by the influence which her brothers had acquired over her.
When Mary declared war againſt that kingdom, Henry required the Queen-regent
to take part in the quarrel; and ſhe ſummoned a convention of ſtates at
Newbottle, and requeſted them to concur in a declaration of war againſt
England. The Scotch nobles, who were as jealous of French as the Engliſh were
of Spaniſh influence, refuſed their aſſent; and the Queen was obliged
to have recourſe to artifice, in order to effectuate her purpoſe. She
ordered d'Oiſel to begin ſome fortifications at Eymouth, a place which had
been diſmantled by the laſt treaty with Edward; and when the garriſon of
Berwic, as ſhe foreſaw, made an inroad to prevent the undertaking, ſhe
effectually employed this pretence to inflame the Scotch nation, and to engage
them in hoſtilities againſt England<note n="‡" place="bottom">Buchan.
lib. xvi. Thuan. lib. xix. c. 7.</note>. The enterprize, however, of the Scotch
proceeded no farther than ſome inroads on the borders; and when d'Oiſel, of

he was recalled, and very ſharply rebuked by the council<note n="‖" place="bottom">Knox, p. 93.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Marriage of the dauphin and the Queen of
Scots.</note> IN order to connect Scotland more cloſely with France, and to
increaſe the influence of the latter kingdom, it was thought proper by Henry
to compleat the marriage between the young Queen and the dauphin; and a
deputation was ſent by the Scotch Parliament, to aſſiſt at this
ceremony, and to ſettle the terms of the contract. This deputation
conſiſted of the archbiſhop of Glaſgow, the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Roſs and
the Orkneys, the earls of Rothes, and Caſſilis, the lords Fleming and
Seton, James Stuart, prior of St. Andrews, natural brother to the Queen, and
Erſkine of Dun. The principal conditions recommended to theſe
commiſſioners, was to obtain a ſolemn engagement from the Queen and
dauphin, that they would preſerve the laws and privileges of Scotland, and to
procure a renewal of the French King's promiſe, to ſupport, in caſe of
the Queen's death, <pb n="397" facs="tcp:0429000101:401"/> the ſucceſſion of the earl of
Arran, now created duke of Chatolraut. Both theſe conditions were eaſily
obtained; but the court of France took a very perfidious ſtep, directly
contrary to theſe ſtipulations: They ſecretly engaged the young Queen to
ſign three papers; by one of which ſhe made over the kingdom of Scotland in
gift to the King of France, in caſe of her deceaſe without children; by
another ſhe mortgaged it to him for a million of crowns of gold, or ſuch
greater ſum as he ſhould have expended for her maintenance and ſupport;
and by a third ſhe declared, that whatever deed ſhe had been obliged, or
ſhould hereafter be obliged to perform, relative to the ſucceſſion of
the crown, it ſhould be entirely invalid, and that her real ſenſe and
intention was contained in the firſt paper. The marriage was
ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized<note place="margin">24 April.</note>at Paris: The
commiſſioners, in the name of the ſtates of Scotland, ſwore allegiance
to the Queen, and, during the continuance of the marriage, to the King-dauphin,
ſo he was called: And every thing ſeemed to proceed with great unanimity
and concord. But the commiſſioners being required to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up the crown,
and other enſigns of royalty, made anſwer, that they had received no
authority for that purpoſe; and they ſoon after ſet out on their journey
for Scotland. It is remarkable, that before they embarked, four of the
commiſſioners died, within a few days of each other; and a violent, tho'
abſurd ſuſpicion prevailed, that they had been poiſoned by orders from
the family of Guiſe, on account of this refuſal<note n="*" place="bottom">Buchan. lib. xvi. Keith, p. 75. Spotſwood, p. 95.</note>. It was
not conſidered, that that accident, however rare, might have happened by the
courſe of nature; and that the preſent ſeaſon, tho' not attended with
any peſtilential diſorder, was, to a ſingular degree, unhealthy all over
Europe.</p>
               <p>THE cloſe alliance between France and Scotland threatned very
nearly the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and ſecurity of England; and it was foreſeen, that,
tho' the factions and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which might naturally be expected in the
Scotch government during the abſence of their ſovereign, made its power
leſs formidable, that kingdom would at leaſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to the French a means
of invading England. The Queen, therefore, found it<note place="margin">20th
January<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>neceſſary to ſummon a Parliament, and to demand of
them ſome ſupplies to her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted<note place="margin">A
Parliament.</note>exchequer. As ſuch an emergency uſually gives great
advantage to the people, and as the Parliaments, during this reign, had
ſhewn, that, where the liberty and independency of the kingdom were menaced
with imminent danger, they were not entirely overawed by the court; we ſhall
naturally expect, that the late arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary methods of extorting money ſhould,
at leaſt, be cenſured, and, perhaps, ſome remedy be for the future
provided againſt them. But ſuch an exorbitant prerogative was at this time
acknowleged to belong to the crown, that, tho' men might complain of its
preſent abuſes, all attempts to retrench it would have been 
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0429000101:402"/> regarded as the moſt criminal enterprize; and as that
prerogative involved a large diſcretionary power, any parliamentary enquiry
into its exerciſe, would have paſſed for inſolent and preſumptuous.
The commons, therefore, without making any reflections on the paſt, voted,
beſides a fifteenth, a ſubſidy of four ſhillings in the pound on land,
and two ſhillings and eight pence on goods. The clergy granted eight
ſhillings in the pound, payable in four years by equal portions.</p>
               <p>THE Parliament alſo paſſed an act, confirming all the
ſales and grants of crown lands, which were either made already by the Queen,
or ſhould be made during the ſeven enſuing years. It was eaſy to
foreſee, that, in the Queen's preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and ſituation,
this power would be followed by a great alienation of the crown lands; and
nothing could be more contrary to the principles of good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, than a
prince armed with very extenſive authority, and yet reduced to beggary. This
act met with oppoſition in the houſe of commons. One Copley expreſſed
his fears leſt the Queen, under colour of the power there granted, might
alienate the crown from the lawful heir: But his words were thought
<hi>irreverent</hi> to her majeſty: He was committed to the cuſtody of the
ſerjeant at arms; and tho' he expreſſed ſorrow for his offence, he was
not releaſed till the Queen was applied to for his forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p>THE Engliſh nation, during this whole reign, were in continual
apprehenſions with regard not only to the ſucceſſion, but the life of
the lady Elizabeth. The violent hatred which the Queen bore her, broke out on
every occaſion; and it required all the authority of Philip, as well as her
own great prudence, to prevent the fatal effects of it. The princeſs retired
into the country; and knowing that ſhe was ſurrounded with ſpies, ſhe
paſt her time wholly in reading and ſtudy, intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in no
buſineſs, and ſaw very little company. While ſhe remained in this
ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was for the preſent very melancholy, but which prepared
her mind for thoſe great actions by which her life was afterwards ſo much
diſtinguiſhed; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of marriage were made her by the Swediſh
ambaſſador, in his maſter's name. As her firſt queſtion was, whether
the Queen had been informed of this propoſal; the ambaſſador told her,
that his maſter thought, as he was a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, it was his duty firſt to
make his addreſſes to herſelf; and having obtained her conſent, he
would next, as a King, apply to her ſiſter. But the princeſs would allow
him to proceed no further; and the Queen, after thanking her for this
inſtance of duty, deſired to know how ſhe ſtood affected to the
Swediſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. Elizabeth, tho' expoſed to many preſent dangers and
mortifications, had the magnanimity to reſerve herſelf to better fortune;
and ſhe covered her refuſal with profeſſions of a paſſionate

like prudence in concealing her ſentiments of religion, in complying with the

                     <p>The common net at that time, ſays Sir Richard Baker, for
catching of proteſtants, was the real preſence; and this net was uſed to
catch the lady Elizabeth: For being aſked one time what ſhe thought of the
words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my body,</hi> whether ſhe thought it the true
body of Chriſt that was in the ſacrament; it is ſaid, that, after ſome
pauſing, ſhe thus anſwered: 
<q> 
                           <l>Chriſt was the word that ſpake it;</l> 
                           <l>He took the bread and brake it;</l> 
                           <l>And what the word did make it,</l> 
                           <l>That I believe and take it.</l> 
                        </q> Which, tho' it may
ſeem but a ſlight expreſſion, yet hath it more ſolidneſs than at
firſt ſight appears; at leaſt it ſerved her turn at that time, to
eſcape the net, which by direct anſwer ſhe could not have done. Baker's
Chronicle, p. 320.</p>

               <p>THE money granted by Parliament, enabled the Queen to fit out a
fleet of a hundred and forty ſail, which, being joined by thirty Flemiſh
ſhips, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſix thouſand land forces on board, was ſent to
make an attempt on the coaſt of Brittany. The fleet was commanded by lord
Clinton; the land forces by the earls of Huntingdon and Rutland. But the
equipment of the fleet and army was ſo dilatory, that the French got
intelligence of the deſign, and were prepared to receive them. The Engliſh
found Breſt too well guarded to make an attempt on that place; but landing at
Conquet, they plundered and burnt the town with ſome adjoining villages, and
were proceeding to commit greater diſorders, when Kerſimon, a Breton
gentleman, at the head of ſome militia, fell upon them, put them to rout, and
drove them to their ſhips with conſiderable loſs. But a ſmall
ſquadron of ten Engliſh ſhips, had an opportunity of amply revenging this
diſgrace upon the French. The Mareſchal de Thermes, governor of Calais, had
made an irruption into Flanders, with an army of fourteen thouſand men; and
having forced a paſſage over the river Aa, had taken Dunkirk, and Berg St.
Winoc, and had advanced as far as Newport. But count Egmont coming ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
upon him, with ſuperior forces, he was obliged to retire; and being
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the Spaniards near Gravelines, he choſe very ſkilfully his
ground for the engagement. He fortified his left wing with all the precautions
poſſible; and poſted his right along the river Aa, which, he reaſonably
thought, gave him a full ſecurity from that quarter. But the Engliſh
ſhips, which were accidentally on the coaſt, being drawn by the noiſe of
the firing, ſailed up the river, and flanking the French, 
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0429000101:404"/> did ſuch execution by their artillery, that they put
them to flight; and the Spaniards gained a compleat victory<note n="‡" place="bottom">Holingſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 1150.</note>.</p>
               <p>MEANWHILE the principal army of France, under the duke of
Guiſe, and that of Spain, under the duke of Savoy, approached very near each
other on the frontiers of Picardy; and as the two Kings had come into their
reſpective camps, attended by the flower of their nobility, men expected that
ſome great and important event would follow, from the emulation of theſe
warlike nations. But Philip, tho' actuated by the ambition, poſſeſſed
not the enterprize, of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror; and he was willing, notwithſtanding the
ſuperiority of his numbers, and the two great victories which he had gained
at St. Quintin and Gravelines, to put a period to the war by a treaty.
Negociations were entered into for that purpoſe; and as the terms offered by
the two monarchs were ſomewhat wide of each other, the armies were put into
winter quarters, till the princes could come to better agreement. Among other
conditions, Henry demanded the reſtitution of Navarre to its lawful owner;
Philip that of Calais and its territory to England: But in the midſt of
theſe negociations and debates, news arrived of the death of Queen Mary; and
Philip, no longer connected with England, began to relax in his inſtances on
that capital article. This was the only circumſtance which could have made
the death of that princeſs a loſs to the kingdom.</p>
               <p>MARY had been long in a very declining ſtate of health; and
having miſtaken her dropſy for a pregnancy, ſhe had made uſe of an
improper regimen, and her malady daily augmented. Every reflection now
tormented her: The conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of being hated by her ſubjects, the
proſpect of Elizabeth's ſucceſſion, apprehenſions of the danger to
which the catholic religion ſtood expoſed, dejection for the loſs of
Calais<note n="‖" place="bottom">The loſs of Calais ſo much affected
her, that ſhe ſaid to her attendant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, that when ſhe was dead, they would find Calais at her
heart.</note>, concern for the ill ſtate of her affairs, and, above all,
anxiety for the abſence of her huſband, who, ſhe knew, intended ſoon to
depart for Spain, and to ſettle there during the reſt of his life: All
theſe melancholy circumſtances preyed upon her mind, and threw her into a
lingering fever, of<note place="margin">Death of the Queen.</note>which ſhe
died, after a ſhort and unfortunate reign of five years, four months,<note place="margin">17 November.</note>and eleven days.</p>
               <p>IT is not neceſſary to employ many words in drawing the
character of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. She poſſeſſed few qualities, either
eſtimable or amiable; and her perſon was as little engaging as her
behaviour and addreſs. Obſtinacy, bigotry, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, cruelty, malignity,
revenge, tyranny; every circumſtance of her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter took a tincture from
her bad temper and narrow underſtanding. And <pb n="401" facs="tcp:0429000101:405"/> amidſt
that complication of vices, which entered into her compoſition, we ſhall
ſcarce find any virtue but ſincerity; a quality, which ſhe ſeems to
have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained throughout her whole life; except in the beginning of her
reign, when the neceſſity of her affairs obliged her to make ſome
promiſes to the proteſtants, which ſhe certainly never intended to
perform. But in theſe caſes a weak bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted woman, under the government of
prieſts, eaſily finds caſuiſtry ſufficient to juſtify to herſelf
the violation of an engagement. She appears alſo, as well as her father, to
have been ſuſceptible of ſome attachments of friendſhip; and that
without the caprice and inconſtancy which were ſo remarkable in the conduct
of that monarch. To which we may add, that, in many circumſtances of her
life, ſhe gave indications of reſolution and vigour of mind; a quality,
which ſeems to have been inherent in her family.</p>
               <p>CARDINAL Pole had been long in a declining ſtate of health
from an intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fever; and he died the ſame day with the Queen, about
ſixteen hours after her. The benign character of this prelate, the modeſty
and humanity of his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made him be univerſally beloved; inſomuch
that in a nation, where the moſt furious perſecution was carried on, and
the moſt violent religious factions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, entire juſtice, even by
moſt of the reformers, has been done to his merit. The haughty pontiff, Paul
the fourth, had entertained ſome prejudices againſt him; and when England
declared war againſt Henry, the ally of that pope, he ſeized the
opportunity of revenge, and revoking Pole's legantine commiſſion, appointed
in his room cardinal Peyto, an obſervantine friar and confeſſor to the
Queen. But Mary would never permit the new legate to exerciſe his power; and
Paul was afterwards obliged to reſtore cardinal Pole to his authority.</p>
               <p>THERE occur few general remarks, beſides what have been taken
notice of in the courſe of our narration, with regard to the general ſtate
of the kingdom during this reign. The naval power of England was then ſo
inconſiderable, that fourteen thouſand pounds being ordered to be applied
to the fleet by the treaſurer and admiral, both for repairing and victualling
it, they computed, that, when that money was expended, ten thouſand pounds a
year would afterwards anſwer a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

queſtion this exerciſe of the prerogative. The hiſtorians are entirely
ſilent with regard to it; and it is only by the collection of public papers
that it is handed down to us.</p>
               <p>AN abſurd law had been made in the preceding reign, by which
every one was prohibited from making cloth unleſs he had ſerved an
apprenticeſhip for ſeven years. This law was repealed in the firſt year
of the Queen's reign; and this plain reaſon given, that it had occaſioned
the decay of the woolen manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and had ruined ſeveral towns<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Mar. Parl. 2. cap. 7.</note>. It is ſtrange that
Edward's law ſhould have been revived during the reign of Elizabeth; and
ſtill more ſtrange, that it ſhould ſtill ſubſiſt.</p>
               <p>A PASSAGE to Archangel, by the north of Nova Zembla, had been
diſcovered by the Engliſh during the laſt reign; and a beneficial trade
with Muſcovy had been eſtabliſhed. A ſolemn embaſſy was ſent by
the Czar to Queen Mary. The ambaſſadors were ſhipwrecked on the coaſt
of Scotland; but being hoſpitably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained there, they proceeded on their
journey, and were received at London with great pomp and ſolemnity<note n="*" place="bottom">Hollingſhed, p. 732. Heylin, p. 71.</note>. This ſeems to have
been the firſt intercourſe, which that empire had with any of the weſtern
potentates of Europe.</p>
               <p>A LAW was paſſed in this reign<note n="‖" place="bottom">4 &amp; 5 Phil. &amp; Mar. cap. 2.</note>, by which the number of
horſes, arms, and furniture, was eſtabliſhed, which each perſon,
according to the extent of his property, ſhould be provided of for the
defence of the kingdom. A man of a thouſand pounds a year, for inſtance,
was obliged to maintain at his own charges ſix horſes fit for demi-lances,
of which three at leaſt to be furniſhed with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient harneſſes,
ſteel ſaddles, and weapons proper for the demi-lances; and ten light
horſes fit for light horſemen, with furniture and weapons requiſite for
them: He was alſo obliged to have forty corſlets furniſhed; fifty almain
rivets, or inſtead of them, forty coats of plate, corſlets or brigandines
furniſhed; forty pikes, thirty long bows, thirty ſheafs of arrows, thirty
ſteel caps or ſkulls, twenty black bills or halberts, twenty haquebuts, and
twenty morions or ſallets. We may remark, that a man of a thouſand merks of
ſtock was rated equal to one of two hundred pounds a year: A proof that few
or none at that time lived on their ſtock in money, and that great profits
were made by the merchants in the courſe of their trade. There is no claſs
above a thouſand pounds a year.</p>
