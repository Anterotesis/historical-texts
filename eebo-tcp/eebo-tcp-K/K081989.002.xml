            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſuch a Neglect of writing, as can hardly be <hi>excuſed</hi> on any
<hi>other</hi> Score. I cannot, indeed, lay Claim to what the Doctors call an
<hi>acute Diſeaſe:</hi> but <hi>Dizzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Head,</hi> and
<hi>Depreſſion of Spirits</hi> are at <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1173200202:11"/> beſt no
<hi>trivial</hi> Maladies, and great <hi>Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to writing.
There is a lethargic State of <hi>Mind</hi> that deſerves your Pity, not your
Anger; though it may require the <hi>Hellebore</hi> of ſharp Reproof. Why
then did you not apply this pungent Remedy, before the Diſeaſe was gone
ſo far? But ſeriouſly, I paſs too much of that Sort of Time, wherein I
am neither <hi>well</hi> nor <hi>ill</hi>; and being unable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
myſelf at large, am averſe to do ſo by Halves. From the ſtrange
Laconiciſm of your Letter, I am really in Doubt, whether you are not angry at
me; and yet had rather this were owing to <hi>Anger</hi> that <hi>may</hi>
ſubſide, than to any perſevering <hi>Fondneſs</hi> you may have for
ſuch unuſual Brevity. Should the latter become habitual, I ſhall ſee
the Letters of a Genius dwindle to 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>per firſt will adviſe the
Needful.</hi>"</q> God forbid ſuch a Transformation!</p>
            <p>Your <hi>former</hi> Letter, to my great Confuſion, was dated
<hi>Sept.</hi> 18. Let me ſpeak firſt to ſome few Parts of it—The
Lampreys arrived ſafe, and were as good as I ever taſted; but every Time I
taſted them, I wanted <hi>you</hi>; and you are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1173200202:12"/> if you imagine, I can half reliſh ſuch Cates
<hi>alone:</hi> however, I return you Thanks.</p>
            <p>You gave me no Account how far the <hi>Bath</hi> Waters,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> were judged expedient for you. A <hi>charitable</hi> Action
called you up to Town; and you, in the Benevolence of your Heart, preſume,
that this <hi>accounts for</hi> the Neglect of every Advantage that concerned
<hi>yourſelf.</hi> Pray let me know whether the Bath was proper for you at
the ſame Time inform me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you were able to ſerve Mrs. H—. I
ſhall be ſorry for <hi>you,</hi> as well as <hi>her,</hi> if you ſhould
miſs the Gratification you would derive from the Succeſs of ſuch an
Endeavour.</p>
            <p>Were I rich, I would erect a Temple to <hi>Simplicity</hi> and
<hi>Grace</hi>; or, as the latter Word would be <hi>equivocal,</hi> to
<hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Elegance.</hi> I am glad to hear that Mr. W— 
has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to deify the <hi>former</hi>; as he will produce better
<hi>Grounds</hi> for ſuch a <hi>Conſecration</hi> than was ever done by
Pagans, or by Papiſts, on any <hi>ſuch</hi> Occaſion. By the Way, I take
that God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs to be a remarkable Friend to Eaſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence. There is
another well-deſerving Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1173200202:13"/> 
               <hi>Delicacy,</hi>
whoſe Cauſe has been ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerted, by either Mr. MELMOTH, or Dr.
LANCASTER.</p>
            <p>Will it make better for me, or worſe, to ſay, I've not yet
written to Mr. GRAVES? But I will poſitively write, within this Week, if it
coſt me a Doſe of Salts to clear my Brain. As to what he ſays about my
printing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, he <hi>may</hi> be <hi>right,</hi> and I am
<hi>ſure</hi> he is <hi>friendly:</hi> but more of this in a little Time.</p>
            <p>Since the Receipt of your laſt Letter, Mr. PERCY and his Wife came
and ſpent a good Part of the Week here; and <hi>he,</hi> alſo, would needs
write a Deſcription of the <hi>Leaſowes.</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the latter Part of
his Circuit, my Friend JAGO and I accompanied him; and what was produced on
that Occaſion, you will go near to know in a little Time. Mean while I am
more and more convinced, that no Deſcription of this Place can make any
Figure in Print, unleſs ſome <hi>Strictures</hi> upon <hi>Gardening,</hi>
and <hi>other</hi> Embelliſhments be ſuperadded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1173200202:14"/>Mr. JAGO has been with me twice, having written a
Poem in blank Verſe, which he leaves here for my Reviſal. 'Tis a
deſcriptive Poem, called <hi>Edge-Hill,</hi> and admits an Account of the
Battle fought there, together with many legendary Tales and Epiſodes.</p>
            <p>About a Week ago, I paid a Viſit of two or three Days, which I had
long promiſed, to Lord FOLEY. His Table, for a Conſtancy, is the moſt
magnificent of any I ever ſaw: eighteen or twenty elegant Diſhes; a
continual Succeſſion of Company; his Behaviour, perfectly hoſpitable, and
his Converſation really entertaining. I moſt readily own myſelf to have
been under a Miſtake, with Regard to his <hi>companionable</hi> Character. My
Reception was as agreeable as it could poſſibly be. As to the reſt, he
has a moſt admirable Houſe and Furniture; but without any Room or Utenſil
that would ſtand the Teſt of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern</hi> Criticiſm. The Views around
him, wild and great; and the Park capable of being rendered <hi>fine;
twice</hi> as ſtriking as it is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, if he would fell ſome Oaks,
under the Value of a Crown, and ſome Hawthorns, under <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1173200202:15"/> the
Value of a Half-penny: but 'tis poſſible, at his Time of Life,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> nothing of this Sort will be undertaken. The two Things at
preſent remarkable are, his <hi>Lodge</hi> and his <hi>Chapel.</hi> The
Portico of the former, (deſigned by FLEET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CROFT) affords three different and
ſtriking Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. The Chapel is ſo very ſuperb and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, that
Mrs. GATAKER has nothing to do but ſend you and me <hi>thither,</hi> to ſay
our Prayers in it. In reality, it is perfect Luxury; as I truly thought it,
laſt <hi>Sunday</hi> Se'en-night; <hi>his Pew</hi> is a <hi>Room</hi> with an
handſome Fire-place; the Ceiling carved, painted in Compartments, and the
Remainder enriched with gilt Stucco-Ornaments; the Walls enriched in the ſame
Manner; the beſt painted Windows I ever ſaw; the Monument to his Father,
Mother, and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, coſt, he ſaid, 2000<hi>l.</hi> the middle Aiſle
rendered comfortable by Iron Stoves, in the Shape of Urns; the Organ perfectly
neat, and good, in Proportion to its Size: and to this Chapel you are led
through a Gallery of Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings ſeventy Feet long—And what would you
more? You'll ſay, a good Sermon—I really think his Parſon is able to
preach one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1173200202:16"/>And now I come, laſtly, to ſpeak of your
Letter I received on Monday. What an uncommon Man you are! to take ſo much
Thought for <hi>thoſe,</hi> who never took <hi>any</hi> for

a very clever and a very riſing Lawyer; to whom I am the more obliged for
mentioning me, as I fear I have not the Honour of being the leaſt known to
him.</p>
            <p>Pray write to me as ſoon as poſſible, and I will make you
Amends (if <hi>Writing</hi> will make Amends) for the ſcandalous
<hi>Omiſſions</hi> of which I have been guilty. I have ſomewhat to tell

            </opener>
            <p>I DID indeed give you up for loſt, as a Correſpondent, and find
by your Letter that I am to expect very few future ones. I will endeavour all I
can, to avoid any Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of your Indifference for my own Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
but I don't know for certain, that I ſhall be able, unleſs you aſſiſt
my Endeavours, like my good Genius, by a Courſe of ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Epiſtles, at
certain Diſtances. I myſelf correſpond but very little now, ſo you will
meet with the more Indulgence. I don't find by your Letter that you have much
more Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy than me. I can't tell, indeed, what the Situation of your
Houſe is; I own, mine gives me Offence on no other Conſideration, than that
it does not receive a ſufficient Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of polite Friends, or that it is not
fit to receive them, were they ſo diſpoſed; I would <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1173200202:18"/>
elſe cultivate an Acquaintance with about three or four in my Neighbourhood,
that are of a Degree of Elegance and Station ſuperior to the common run. But
I make it a certain Rule,

with whom 'tis in vain that your Mind is furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if the Walls are naked;

Converſe with ſuch as judge of Merit by Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet I am
now and then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the ſocial Paſſion to ſit half an Hour in my
Kitchen.</p>
            <p>I was all along an Admirer of Sir THOMAS HEAD's Humour and Wit, and
I beg you will repreſent me in that Light, if Occaſion happens. 'Tis not
impoſſible that I may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate this Winter as far as your Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Mr. JAGO,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THOUGH I have not yet troubled you with a Letter, I have not been
void of all Enquiry, or Information concerning your Situation and Mr. HARDY's
Health; indeed, it is now many Weeks ſince I collected ſome Particulars
from your Brother, and I am now impatient for ſome further Intelligence. As
to the Particulars of our friendly Reception at <hi>Wroxhall,</hi> Mr. JOHN
JAGO has very probably acquainted you; he would, however, perſuade me to give
you a diſtinct Account; being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, he ſays, it muſt be a good
Subject for Drollery. I don't know how far this would be proper: but I think,
when I write again to my Friend W—, to give <hi>him</hi> a Sketch of his
own Character, juſt as it appeared du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Time of our Viſit. I do not
mean to give Offence, ſo I ſhall intermix many <pb n="13" facs="tcp:1173200202:22"/> good
Parts of his Character, together with his Oddities. I believe the whole will
take up a Sheet of Paper, for I have already conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. He has
Good-Senſe, and Good-Nature at the Bottom; pity he ſhould diſguiſe the
former by one continued Air of Buffoonry, and the latter by a total Neglect of
common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum.</p>
            <p>Since I came home, I have done little elſe but plant Buſhes,
Hazel, Hawthorn, Crab-Tree, Elder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together with ſome few
flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Shrubs that I have had given me. I think nothing remarkable has
occurred; only one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable tempeſtuous Day, I had the Earl of STAMFORD
called to ſee my Walks, together with Mr. DOVEY, of <hi>Birmingham,</hi> and
two other Gentlemen. My Lord promiſed to come again in Summer, and invited me
to <hi>Enville.</hi> By the Way, he is now building a Gothic
<hi>Green-Houſe,</hi> by Mr. M—'s Direction; and by all Accounts, the
Place is worth your ſeeing, when you come into this Country; 'tis but about
ſix Miles diſtant from hence. Pray do not you embroil me with Mr. M—,
in Regard to the Obſervations I made in his <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1173200202:23"/> Walks.
Remember there were not a few Things with which I was greatly delighted; and if
there were a few that I leſs appeared to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, it was owing to a
Conſciouſneſs, that I was amongſt Friends only, and that I thought it
fooliſh to regulate my Expreſſions by the ſame Rules of Complaiſance,
which I ought to obſerve in different Places. I ſay, <hi>ought,</hi> for he
has been exceeding favourable to me, in his Repreſentations of the
<hi>Leaſowes.</hi> I hope to ſee Mr. FANCOURT with you here this Spring,
and why not your Brother? He can ſpend half a Week now and then at
<hi>Wroxall.</hi> The Duke of S— was treated with Cruelty by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
till he was ſixty-five, and afterwards ſcarce ſurvived him, to enjoy one
Year's Profit of the Eſtate. Such is the Tenure by which we hold our earthly
Tenements!</p>

               <salute>Dear Mr. WHISTLER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS is the firſt Evening I have had to myſelf ſince I left
<hi>Cheltenham</hi>; and as one wants ſome very favourite Subject to
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs one's Thoughts a little, after a long Diſſipation, I could think
of nothing more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual than a Letter to one who has ſo large a Share in
them; beſide, they have given me your Letter from <hi>Bradfield,</hi> and I
am in Pain till I have acknowledged ſo affectionate and polite a Preſent.
People, whoſe very Foibles are ſo many Elegancies, can ſcarce write any
Thing more agreeable than a plain, unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Account of them. I remember, I
uſed to think this a Kind of Diſtinction between Mr. GRAVES and you; that
the one had the Knack of making his Virtues unenvied, and the other of
rendering (what I perhaps unjuſtly termed) his Weakneſſes enviable. I am
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <pb n="16" facs="tcp:1173200202:25"/> afraid of inſerting this, leſt it ſhould
ſeem to injure the ſuperlative Eſteem I have of you: but I muſt add,
that I conſider a Mixture of Weakneſſes, and an ingenuous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of them, as the moſt engaging and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable Part of any Character; if I did
not, I could not allot them you, whoſe Manner is ſo diſtinguiſhedly
amiable.</p>
            <p>Since I left <hi>Cheltenham,</hi> I have been at Mr. B—'s, in
<hi>Biſhop's-Caſtle.</hi> I rode one Morning with him about three Miles,
that I might ſay, I had been in <hi>Wales,</hi> and ſeen <hi>Brecon,
Caderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> and <hi>Plinlimmon,</hi> with an extenſive Chain of other
Mountains. I called at a ſmall Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, where the People lived all the
Winter without any Glaſs in their Windows. I was wondering how they could
live ſo, in a more cold Country than you have, perhaps, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced. The
Wife ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"True it was, ſhe could like Glaſs very
well."</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Yes,"</q> ſays the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, 
<q rend="inline">"Glaſs is very genteel, that it is."</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Nay,</q> ſays the Wife, 
<q rend="inline">"not for the Gentleelneſs nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though it is
very genteel, that's the Truth on't."</q> This Circumſtance ſtruck me a
good deal, that they ſhould diſcover the genteelneſs <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1173200202:26"/>
of Glazing, and never once think of its <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency.</hi> Mr. B— is a
Man you would like upon Acquaintance, though, as I remember, you had ſome
Objection to the Superfluity of his Wit. We ſhall, in all Probability, have
frequent Interviews with him at <hi>Bath, London, &amp;c.</hi> He would fain
have ſeduced me to have travelled into <hi>Portugal, &amp;c.</hi> with
himſelf, and one Mr. MOORE, his Neighbour; an agreeable, modeſt Man, and
late Member for <hi>Biſhop's-Caſtle.</hi> I declined it for two Reaſons;
firſt, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Expence, and ſecondly, that I could not think of
ſpending two Years in <hi>this</hi> Part of my Life abroad; dead to one's own
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and procuring, at beſt, very periſhable, and uſeleſs
Friendſhips in another. If I could have ſtaid, I was to have gone with him
to a <hi>Welſh</hi> Seſſions, fraught with Iraſcibility. He is a
Juſtice of Peace there.</p>
            <p>As to good Acquaintance, though I much deſire it, I have as
literally a Genius for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as any one ever had for procuring it. I
cannot approach within fifty Yards of Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for fear of it.</p>
            <p>

Converſation, I ſhould not, perhaps, have been very forward to expreſs my

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I promiſed you ſome Poetry for Mr. S—, I am afraid
that, through my Deſire of recommending myſelf to his Family, my Tongue
out-run my Wit. If I laid any Sort of <hi>Streſs</hi> upon what I was to
ſend, I am very ſure it did ſo; and when you have read the Trifles
encloſed, you will be of the ſame Opinion.</p>
            <p>It is probable, however, that I had an Eye to a larger Ode of mine,
upon the Subject of rural Elegance, which I have not now Time either to correct
or to tranſcribe; but which I will not fail to communicate to them upon
ſome future Occaſion.</p>
            <p>Or if my Promiſe regarded a Tranſlation of the Mottos
<hi>here,</hi> I ſhall have the beſt Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of performing it, when I
take the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms <pb n="21" facs="tcp:1173200202:30"/> you have allowed me, with your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite
Deſcription of my Farm.</p>
            <p>Am I wrong in detaining that Paper?—For poſitively, theſe
laſt few Days I have found myſelf a good deal feveriſh, and my Head has
been ſo much confuſed, that I was almoſt tempted to omit this
Meſſage. In this Caſe, I think your Good-nature would have acquitted me
of <hi>Diſreſpect:</hi> but I could not ſuffer you to leave the Country
with ſo bad an Opinion of my punctuality.</p>
            <p>It remains, that I preſent my beſt Reſpects to Dr. TURTON and
his Lady, and that I wiſh you an agreeable Journey to <hi>Oxford.</hi> I
purpoſe, in a few Weeks, that you ſhall be enabled to ſay ſomething
more particular, in Regard to M—'s Poetry; in the mean Time, I deſire
that he would accept my Compliments, and my Thanks for the Pleaſure his
Verſes have afforded me. Above all Things, aſſure Mr. ARNOLD of my moſt
unfeigned Eſteem; and if he diſcovers any Partiality for my Place or me,
encourage it, that it may induce him, on a proper Occaſion, to favour me once
more <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1173200202:31"/> with his Company. You ſee, I am availing myſelf
of <hi>your</hi> Intereſt, to make all your Friends my own; and to attone for
this Piece of Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhneſs, it ſhall not be my Fault, if every Friend I
have be not yours, at leaſt, with ſome Share of that Regard with which I
am,</p>

            <p>I Received your agreeable Letter; read all the fine Things your (I
fear prejudiced) Good-nature made you ſay; at firſt diſtruſted them:
but when I reflected on the Perſon who ſaid them, I found a ſtrong
Inclination riſe in me to believe them; but how to be convinced I was ſtill
at a Loſs; for I know it is in your Power, either to make Flattery paſs for
Sincerity, or Sincerity (ſo juſtly dreaded from <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1173200202:32"/> the
Unſkilful) pleaſing. But be it as it will, I ſhall be a Gainer by it; for
if 'tis Flattery, it will give me a fair Reputation, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved, with
all who hear it; but if 'tis true, it will aſſure me, I deſerve one from
all who can like you beſtow one.</p>
            <p>You enquired after Mr. D—. He, and his Lady, and Miſs
B—s, have drank Tea with me twice within this Fortnight. We went to
<hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> Prayers together, from thence, arrayed in Gold and
Silver, we ruſhed into <hi>St. John's-Chapel,</hi> where we ſtood, knelt
and ſate, (I won't ſay prayed) the whole Service-Time; for you know it is
uſual there for Strangers to ſit in the Choir, which we did, to the great
Advantage both of the Fan and the Snuff-Box, which were neither of them long
unemployed, during Divine Service. You know they are great Helps to Devotion:
Snuff cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly compoſes, and a Fan may waft a Soul to Heaven before it is
aware.</p>
            <p>Mrs. L— ſtill perſeveres. She gave it out before ſhe had
ſeen her, that Miſs B— was like a Cat, which when ſhe found Miſs
B— <pb n="24" facs="tcp:1173200202:33"/> had heard, ſhe wrote a Letter to excuſe
her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and concluded moſt emphatically with theſe Words, 
<q rend="inline">"No, Madam, I am not quite ſo unbred; it was not
I, but Common-Fame, ſaid you were like a Cat."</q> I really think here, that
Mrs. L— topt Mrs. L—'s Part. Mr. G— is ſtill a Prude; I
ſee him ſometimes, but ſhould be glad to ſee him of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener. I know no
one Circumſtance, but Breach of Sincerity, that can ever be a Reaſon with
me to ſlight my Friends. If a Friend of mine had broke all Laws, both human
and divine, yet had conſpicuouſly preſerved his Integrity to me, I
ſhould only think myſelf the more obliged to him, and though I pitied him,
would never forſake him firſt; I ſhould think he had a higher Notion of
Friendſhip, and that that was the only Tie which he dared not violate, for
which Reaſon I would not dare to be a greater Villain than he. I don't know
how this Thought came into my Head, but you ſee I was willing to ſpin it to
its full Length; if I have gone too far, you muſt impute it to that Rapture
of Friendſhip with which I am yours eternally,</p>

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE waited thus long upon a dilatory Lawyer, called, I
ſuppoſe, in <hi>Hebrew, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi>; at leaſt, I am confident, Lawyer
is but a ſynonimous Term for the Devil. I have ſtayed, and muſt ſtay,
to ſign ſome Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which cannot be done without me; and his Delay
has cauſed mine, in not anſwering your kind Letter before. I muſt
likewiſe go to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> on the ſame Buſineſs, ſo that,
to put you out of a diſagreeable Expectation, I pluck up Reſolution to tell
you, I am afraid I cannot wait upon you this Summer; at once to reſiſt your
Kindneſs, and my own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, in my Opinion, is a great Act of
Reſolution, at leaſt would be ſo, if I had any Degree of Choice left me:
but as it is, I think the enduring my Diſappointment a great Trial of my
Patience. Mr. GRAVES will witneſs the <pb n="26" facs="tcp:1173200202:35"/> Truth of my
Misfortune, who has been at <hi>Whitchurch</hi> lately, and who intended to
ſee you ſoon. I ſuppoſe he told you his Errand into theſe Parts, a
providential Thing for me, and one of the happieſt Revolutions in my Life, if
it ſucceed, as I hope it will. My Spirits are quite grown ruſty, with long
and fruitleſs Expectations of Happineſs, and no Tools are fine enough to
poliſh, or, as the Artiſts ſay, to touch them, but yourſelf or Mr.
GRAVES. I knew nothing of his coming till I ſaw him, for which Reaſon I
looked upon him as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Manna or Food from Heaven.</p>
            <p>I lament very much that you don't deſign to be in <hi>London</hi>
next Winter: I ſhall be there for about ſix Weeks, towards the Middle of
it. The Winter we met there, I thought a pleaſant one, and enough to
encourage a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Meeting in the ſame Place—The only Place for
Whims, practicable there without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, or falling from that Dignity which
'tis neceſſary for a Gentleman to maintain in the Country. I ſhould like
mightily to indulge my Fancy in ſome innocent, private, romantic 
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1173200202:36"/> Expeditions; I know not what—But all Things as I
ſaid, are poſſible there.</p>
            <p>Mr. GRAVES tells me you are a great Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomiſt. If ſo, I hope
<hi>London</hi> will be the richer for it, and you the finer, as
<hi>Luxury</hi> is the Daughter of <hi>Induſtry,</hi> and <hi>Induſtry</hi>
again the Mother of <hi>Luxury,</hi> each reigning by Turns, and ſo the World
goes on. If you ſhould go to <hi>London</hi> this Winter, you'll call at
<hi>Whitchurch</hi> by the Way, and we'll go together, which will prevent any
Diſappointment. You will always be received here, with Acknowledgment of the
Favour you do us; ſo ſay we all, and preſent our Compliments in one
Garland to you, which I beg you will accept, though it is but coarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put
together, and you will oblige</p>

            <p>I Received your kind Letter, and, in Spite of all you have ſaid, I
muſt ſtill think that the Obligation is entirely on my Side, and you have
only, in my Opinion, laid a greater Streſs upon it by ſo generouſly
diſclaiming it. I am reſolved to be pleaſed with every Thing you ſay or
do, and if I were not, you are reſolved I ſhall. I am very glad you intend
me a Viſit; but am likewiſe very ſorry, I muſt beg you to defer it for
ſome Time; our Family talk of going to <hi>Briſtol</hi> very ſoon, and as
I have no where elſe to go, muſt go with them. If it was in my Power to
defer the Journey, I would gladly do it, to wait on Mr. SHEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STONE, at
<hi>Whitchurch</hi>; or if I could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Houſe in their Abſence,
their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and his Preſence would be to me a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Happineſs. But
as it is, I muſt, at preſent, <pb n="29" facs="tcp:1173200202:38"/> be without a Pleaſure,
which I hope will not always thus fly from me; I hope the lat-End of this
Summer, and Mr. SHENSTONE, will be both more favourable to me, and if ſo, I
ſhall reckon that the Spring of the Year is yet to come; I, who place the
Seaſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in my own Fancy.</p>
            <p>I forgot to tell you in my laſt, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs AMELIA did
us the Honour of a Viſit at <hi>Whitchurch,</hi> though we were obliged to
the Stag for it, who ſeemed to fly from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhe deſigned him, and
had not Ambition enough (as LEE ſays) to meet the Blow half Way, or be
pleaſed with Death, though in the Royal Preſence. It was a terrible Day,
and the Princeſs was wet through; ſhe had rode thirty Miles when I ſaw
her, and ſhe rode thirty Miles after that, which was ſix o'Clock at Night,
in her wet Cloaths, and appeared at the Drawing-Room at St. <hi>James</hi>'s,
the next Day, which was a Birth-Day.</p>
            <p>The Princeſs (with Submiſſion be it ſpoke) gave me no
Satisfaction, not through any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in her Demeanour—but from the
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied <pb n="30" facs="tcp:1173200202:39"/> State of Mind. I could be contented with
nothing leſs than you; and I hope you will be ſo good, as not to let this
Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which I aſſure you is a great Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to me,

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE not received your Letter above a Week ago, being but lately
come to Town, which is the true Reaſon why I have not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered it. Few
Reaſons, and none but good ones ſhall ever prevent me from preſenting my
Heart to you: but my Journey hither has been prevented, partly by ill Health,
and partly by little, ill-natured, impertinent Accidents—This
Suſpenſe had had an equal Effect on my writing to you. I here end my moſt
ſincere Apology.</p>
            <p>Now for News—I am in <hi>London</hi>; for which Reaſon, I
ſuppoſe I muſt not be excuſed; tho' I hate it, remember very little,
and am moſt likely to blunder in the Recital of that little. The Houſe of
Commons have addreſſed the King to try MATTHEWS and LESTOCK, and ſix
Captains, by a Court-Martial, and it is <pb n="32" facs="tcp:1173200202:41"/> thought, ſome of
them will be condemned.—Poor GARRICK has been dangerouſly ill of a
Fever this Week: but now, to my great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, there are Hopes of his
Recovery; nay, it is noticed in the <hi>Daily Advertiſer,</hi> that he will
perform a Part next <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Night.</p>
            <p>I have been to wait on Lord D—. He was very civil, and would
fain have kept me till he had opened his Heart with a Bottle of Wine; at
leaſt, I imagined his forwarding the Bottle was with that Deſign; but I was
engaged. I am to call upon him to go to <hi>Ranelagh</hi>—a Lord would be
a pretty Noſegay in one's Hand, if he had the leaſt Variety of Colours;
nay, if he reſembled any one Flower of a ſingle Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, except the
<hi>Fuſtus.</hi> Mr. F— I ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, but he is not very
attractive. I always did envy you the Power of Laughing at a Fool by
yourſelf: but you are a World within yourſelf. Mr. P—K, I ſpent an
Evening with lately very agreeably: but he lives ſo far off, at the Court-End
of the Town, as ſeparates us very much. Mr. P—N I often ſee, and find
him a very uſeful Perſon. But if you were here, both agreeable and uſeful
would <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1173200202:42"/> vaniſh, and a far ſuperior Enjoyment take Place.
Mr. GRAVES promiſed to be in <hi>London</hi> for a Week, but his little
Politics are, you know, very uncertain. I have ſtruck a bold Stroke ſince I
have been in Town; I mean a laced Coat, for really Waiſtcoats coſt as much,
and are no Mark of Diſtinction after all. Sir T. HEAD comes to Town this
Week; but I believe, I ſhall not ſtay above a Week longer, ſo would have
you direct to me at <hi>Whitchurch.</hi> I deſign to go to Court one Night. I
muſt, as you ſee, write ſhort, my Paper drawing to an End. It is with
Pleaſure I hear, that old People confeſs a Play is now worth ſeeing, and
that GARRICK excels BETTERTON, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the Diverſity of his
Genius, he muſt far exceed him; when we ſee him alternately in a
<hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> and <hi>Scrub,</hi> in a <hi>Lear,</hi> and <hi>Abel
Drugger,</hi> he is truly aſtoniſhing. This Excellence of our dramatic
Repreſentations is another Reaſon to wiſh you here. CAMPIONI is a
charming new Dancer. The <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was performed laſt Night, but I
could not go.—But I muſt write no more Tattle. I have juſt been with
Mr. SHUGBO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROUGH, and gave him your Orders about the Pamphlets, and have picked
out ſome myſelf, <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1173200202:43"/> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> the Odes, the new Play,
and the Poem on <hi>Sickneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wiſh there had been any better Prints to have encloſed in this
Letter; I ſhould have been glad to have ſent them. The Pamphlets I have
ordered to be ſent immediately, directed to be left at Mr. AUDLEY's, in
<hi>Birmingham.</hi> The Regret I always feel for your Abſence will ever
inſtruct me how to value you, that is beyond what the elaborate Concluſion
of a Letter can expreſs; therefore I will not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſay how much,
but in an unlimited Manner be fond to remain</p>

ſhort the Caſe is this: I ſhall be at <hi>Oxford</hi> in about three

Hours, I make this Requeſt, that you would ſtamp the laſt Impreſſion

your Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which I ſhall eſteem a greater Honour than all the
Degrees the formal Convocation can beſtow; and I think of you, as JUBA does

            <p>I lately wrote you a long Letter, as you were ſo kind to deſire;
and in ſo very lazy unintellectual a Manner, that I am ſure half the
Mortals, who only underſtand with their Eyes and by the Grammar, could never
have comprehended: but I would converſe with you Soul to Soul, have a Hint
underſtood by you, and not be obliged to a tedious Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to communicate a

            <p>YOUR laſt kind Letter has for a long Time upbraided me with
Negligence, Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Stupidity. To the laſt Part of the Accuſation,
I plead guilty; for I think I never found myſelf more ſtupid than I have
been for this Month paſt, and what I write now, proceeds, not from any Flow
of Fancy, but merely from Reſpect and Eſteem. I have <pb n="41" facs="tcp:1173200202:50"/>
been very much taken up of late, by our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily being at Home: but that
Excuſe I lay no Streſs upon; for I ſhall never let any, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Buſineſs or Pleaſure hurry you from my Thoughts. Ill Health can be my
only juſt Apology; and though I cannot ſay I have been ſick, I can
aſſure you, I have not been well for ſome Time paſt. Put my Condition
in the beſt Light, I am very much in the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, and ſo much, as that you
or Mr. GRAVES alone can cure me: a Letter from you will go a great deal towards
it; though I long for one, I can hardly go on with this Letter, which is the
Means to procure it; like one ſinking into a fainting Fit, who can't collect
Strength of Mind or Body, to reach ſo much as the Hartſhorn to his Noſe,
which ſtands at his Elbow. I ſhall be at <hi>Oxford</hi> in a ſhort Time,
and ſpend as many Days there as I can paſs agreeably, and then take my
Leave of it. If the Town be healthy, I ſhall go to <hi>London</hi> the
Beginning of the Winter, and ſtay there juſt as long as it ſmiles on me.
But all Things ſeem to frown in the Abſence of my Friends, and I wiſh I
don't think the Smiles of the Town impertinent without them. 
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1173200202:51"/> I wiſh I could be ſometimes pleaſed with leſs than

            <p>IF you remember, in your laſt Letter but one, you adviſed me to
read Hiſtory: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, as I am always proud to follow your Advice, I

               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:1173200202:52"/> 
               <hi>of his own
Times.</hi> I was over Head and Ears engaged in the Diſputes between
Cavaliers, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſters, Reſolutioners, and God knows who, when I received
your laſt. Though BURNET values himſelf particularly on private
Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, I had a greater Curioſity, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained far greater Hopes
of Pleaſure, in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open your Letter; nor was I at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: I
think you wrote, if poſſible, more agreeably than uſual; it raiſed my
Spirits, and at the ſame Time did more than all King CHARLES's Stateſmen
could do: ſet up an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Monarchy in my Breaſt in a Moment, and made
you Sovereign there.</p>
            <p>Mr. POWYS had a Child chriſtened yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; it was attended to
Church by half a Dozen Coaches. The great Mr. POINTZ was one of the Godfathers,
and Mrs. TOWNSHEND, now an Inhabitant of your Parts, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, by Proxy.
Mrs. POWYS went out on Pleaſure to the laſt, and if her Horſes had not
been good, and her Coachman dexterous to ply them with the Whip, ſhe had been
brought to Bed in her Coach, as once before ſhe had like to have been at the
Play-Houſe.

            </opener>
            <p>I Received you Pacquet, fraught with every Thing that could delight
me. I believe more Wit was never conveyed under the Title of a Peer before; not
even excepting your own, which, indeed, you generally export by wholeſale in
the ſame Method. Your Letter led me through an Elyſian Scene, which
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted me ſo, that I muſt beg Leave to take another Turn with you at
preſent therein. There is no Subject I can treat of with ſo much
Pleaſure, and, of Conſequence, with ſo much Advantage to myſelf. In the
firſt Place, Dick J—, in the Point of Light you ſet him, diverts me;
yet Humanity teaches me to feel a Kind of Pity, as for an Animal that ſings
and hops about the Cage that has juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of his Liberty. Lady
LUXBOROUGH I have ſeen, but not in her Sanctuary, where <pb n="47" facs="tcp:1173200202:56"/>
ſhe delivers her Oracles, and diſplays her Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and Elegancies at
full. This is what my Soul is a-thirſt after; the holy Land of a future
Pilgrimage. You have raiſed a Devotion in me towards her; for we always judge
of the Divinity by the Merits of the Prieſt. By your Deſcription of Mr.
THOMSON, I admire him, and rejoice in your Acquaintance with him. I beg you
would cultivate it, for it ſeems like the Dawning of your Fame, whoſe Merit
the ſtupid World only wants to be awakened to ſee. If ever you get your due
Share of Fame, I inſiſt that you be not a Niggard of it, as many are, but
do your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Endeavour to communicate it to your Friends—You ſee I
ſpeak in Time.</p>
            <p>As for Mr. L—N's Civility, I have no great Faith in it; I fear
he has only ſome private End to ſerve, as an Election or ſo: but,
how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I would have you nouriſh it, for it may breed ſomething by
Chance—It will be a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to you at worſt—Chance often promotes
Lingerers at Court, who have otherwiſe very little Hope. It may fall out,
that by ſerving <pb n="48" facs="tcp:1173200202:57"/> you, he may ſerve himſelf. I
ſhould like to have ſeen Signor OUTING, poor Man.</p>
            <p>I think the <hi>Leaſowes</hi> a charming Place in itſelf; but
not knowing how in my Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at any Time to ſeparate the Work from the
Architect, I believe I give the former infinitely more Adoration than its due,
even with all its Improvements. You would often ſee me gliding acroſs the
Glades, if the Soul was viſible. You, indeed, have contrived to make your
Soul, as it were, viſible; and a very beautiful Soul it is; particularly in
its laſt Dreſs, which became it exceedingly, I mean Elegy—It was
mighty well fancied, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed a tender, languiſhing Air, its higheſt
Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: I am much indebted to it for this ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Viſit; ſpendid I
mean in Beauty. The two old Songs likewiſe were very agreeable to me: but
chiefly <hi>Giles Collins.</hi> As for the Song of the <hi>Cat,</hi> I am much
obliged to you for it: but I think the Author ſunk quite beneath himſelf
towards the End. The Concluſion was too ſudden, and not worked up enough,
and beſides was exceeding dirty; however, it was improved by your
Alterations: upon the whole, I <pb n="49" facs="tcp:1173200202:58"/> like it, and out of my
Devotion for the five firſt Stanzas, I have added ſix more, which I
ſubmit to your Judgment, whether I have ſupported the true Spirit of the
Fragment. Pray excuſe that I have preſumed to omit any of your Alterations;
becauſe I thought in this new Scheme the Context required it.</p>
            <p>I live in Hopes of ſeeing you at <hi>Whitchurch</hi> this Winter,
and of hearing the happy Tidings when; I beg you will let me know ſome Time
before you come, that I may get your Bed in order; I have but one; (it was
given me, and is none of the largeſt; indeed, ſmall, which at preſent I
lament) otherwiſe I ſhould now give more Invitations; I can entertain but
one Friend at a Time: but all my Friends will be ſincerely welcome
ſeverally. Again I ſay, I lament the Unſociableneſs of this Scheme, but
it is not in my Power to alter it. Mr. G—'s Affair goes on, I am afraid,
unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. As for my own Situation, I ſhall ſay lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but leave you to
take a Survey of it, which I hope you will do ſoon. I think it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
for Happineſs, if a Perſon of the leaſt <hi>Delicateſſe</hi> can be
ſo. I rejoice in all you have <pb n="50" facs="tcp:1173200202:59"/> rejoiced in, and pray for

            <p>I AM very much obliged to you for your laſt kind Letter, and
received your Abſolution with a very contrite Heart, though I aſſure you
my Sin was not wilful; however, it was ſuch as <pb n="51" facs="tcp:1173200202:60"/> I
ſincerely lamented, even in the Commiſſion; I ſhould rather ſay
Omiſſion. I am exceeding ſorry to find you have ſo great a Quarrel with
<hi>London.</hi> I ſpeak ſincerely, when I ſay, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe little
Pleaſure there without you. I ſaid in my laſt Letter, we might contrive
to meet there, as hitherto; I think we have contrived not to do it, and if we
were to meet, I can't but fancy we might make it agreeable to each other. I
ſhall go thither immediately after <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and ſhould be glad
to wait on you at <hi>Whitchurch,</hi> and from thence to <hi>London.</hi> You
certainly conclude me happy, in having Mr. GRAVES ſo near me, and with
Reaſon. I ſhould think my Scheme of Friendſhip com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, if you was as
near; but without that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, it is far from being ſo. Sir T. HEAD
and Mr. GRAVES ſpent three Days with me laſt Week to my great
Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>I have had a Swelling in my Foot, which they tell me is the
Gout—God forbid!—but 'tis certainly like it. I intend to go into a
Milk Diet immediately, for I am terribly alarmed. If it ſhould prove ſo, I
ſhall think it a very hard Fate, having been no Drinker, and even 
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1173200202:61"/> Multitudes of thoſe eſcape it: but Fortune fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
the Brutes.</p>
            <p>It was not our Mr. POWYS's Landau, for he was at Home, and beſides
has never a one. I believe Mr. GRAVES and I ſhall return Sir G—'s
Favour ſoon, and ſpend about a Week with him. How ſhall we all wiſh for
you to be with us! That I ſhall, I can be upon my <hi>Bible Oath</hi>; and
for the reſt, I think I can anſwer in the affirmative. My Brother is at
<hi>Whitchurch</hi> at preſent, who is a conſtant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to me while he
ſtays, but I fear that will not be long: but Mr. GRAVES I deſign to ſee
often, both for Health and Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>What with going to <hi>London</hi> this Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and
<hi>Briſtol</hi> in the Summer, as I have laid my Scheme for the future, I

the Thought of waiting upon you, both in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> and at the

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE been extremely buſy of late in new modelling my little
Habitation; and the more ſo, to bring it to ſome Kind of Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in
Order to receive you. I have been building up, pulling down, planting, rooting
up, turning Round to Square, and Square to Round. In ſhort, I don't know, but
ſome <pb n="54" facs="tcp:1173200202:63"/> prudent People would ſay, I have been playing the
Devil. Indeed, (as in other Things in Life) my Fancy is ſo confined by the
Smallneſs of my Poſſeſſions, that my Scheme is not very expenſive:
'tis all in the <hi>Lilliputian</hi> Stile, and muſt be ſo. Though I have
tried to give it what Air of Magnificence it is capable of, I ſuppoſe it
will ſtrut like many of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Heroes who happen not to be four
Feet and a Half high.</p>
            <p>Did Lady LUXBOROUGH approve my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of enjoying Things beſt
by Reflection? I ſtill maintain my Opinion, and endeavour to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify it
thus: What we enjoy by Reflection we have pure, nay, heightened by our own
Fancy, at the ſame Time no Inconvenience attends it; on the contrary, the
Pleaſure is more poignant by the Contraſt. The Thought of an Ice-Houſe in
the Summer is refreſhing, and the Imagination of <hi>July</hi> is a Cordial
in Froſt and Snow; beſides, you well know Hope is the very Hartſhorn of
Life, that enlivens every Thing, and particularly attends imaginary
Pleaſures, but vaniſhes whenever they become real—By Reflection, I
mean Imagination in general.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:1173200202:64"/>I have ſent you Stanzas on Flowers. If Lady
LUXBOROUGH likes them, I ſhall be proud of hitting the Pallate of a Lady of
ſo high a Taſte. I have likewiſe encloſed another Copy of
Verſes—though I am in Doubt, whether I did not ſend them to you
laſt Summer; they were done then. I know you don't love Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but
I have nothing new beſides. I ſet about them merely as an Exerciſe one
Night, when I was dull and alone, not intending any Thing but tearing them
afterwards, for I knew it was a worn-out Subject—But a fatherly
Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection took Place, and I did not care for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it, though it was a
Baſtard produced unawares.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N. B.</hi> I beg that nothing of mine may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Print.</p>
            <p>I admire thoſe two Lines of Lady WORTLEY's very much. It is a
natural yet uncommon and agreeable Thought. I am pleaſed with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
you make me, in ſaying you always wiſh me with you to partake any
Pleaſure, and imagine how any Thing extraordinary would <pb n="56" facs="tcp:1173200202:65"/>
ſtrike me: I like it, becauſe I know it is a natural, and thereby, a
ſincere Thought by my own Heart. I am ſo far gone that Way, that I can
hardly enjoy any Thing extraordinary, without my Friends are with me,
eſpecially thoſe whom I know it would particularly ſtrike: but next to
gratifying a Friend, is the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, how new and extraordinary Objects
work upon a natural Genius; I'll ſuppoſe it a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius; I think it is one of
the higheſt Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments in Life; when I can meet with ſuch, and have an
Opportunity, I love to read a Play to them, though I know I run the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of
being laughed at for my Pains; but I don't care, the Pleaſure pays me for all
the malicious fooliſh People can ſay, and you know the natural Criticiſms
of Sir ROGER DE COVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEY were not thought unworthy the Notice of the
<hi>Britiſh Spectator.</hi> For my Part, I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thought that it is one
of the Amuſements of the Supreme Being, who planted firſt the Paſſions
in us, to obſerve the Workings and Effects of them. A public Audience gives
me Pleaſure upon Truſt, for though I know no one there, I always conclude
there are ſome Geniuſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:1173200202:66"/>I am of your Opinion, with Regard to Mrs.
—, at preſent, for I think, if her Heart be really engaged, which I
very much doubt, Diſhonour in Love is the blackeſt of all diſhoneſt
Actions, and of the worſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence—But his precurſive Steps
were the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Folly, conducted with the Extremity of Folly; but he may
be happy (and I wiſh he may be happy) in any State of Life. I think our
Viſits to DICK J— are fatal; his own Mother lay a dying when we were at
<hi>Henley.</hi> I am very glad to hear you have had ſo many Amuſements. It
is always agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to me, whenever I hear you have met with a flowery Meadow
in your ſublunary Walk. If I have any Taſte, your <hi>Hercules</hi> is an
elegant and truly poetical Poem, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to L—'s: if it is not, I
reſign my Taſte, for I'll pin it upon your Poem. I don't pretend to
Criticiſm; but my Paſſion for SHAKESPEARE, MILTON, POPE, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
has made me believe, that I have ſome natural Taſte for Beauty. I am much
obliged to you for the two genteel Copies of Verſes; they are very pretty,
and much to my Fancy. As for Odes, <pb n="58" facs="tcp:1173200202:67"/> you have expreſſed
my Senſe of them all on that of Dr. AKENSIDE; they perplex and fret one more
than they pleaſe, and may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Title of one of
SHAKESPEARE's Plays, <hi>viz. Much Ado about Nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have no News to ſend you from hence, that will be in the leaſt
entertaining to you. I am in Hopes Mr. GRAVES will ſettle at
<hi>Whitchurch</hi> about <hi>Whitſuntide.</hi> I have been much out of Order
for this Week, by a Cold that I caught in attending my Works; and my Foot gives
me ugly Apprehenſions at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. I continually pleaſe myſelf with the
Thoughts of ſeeing you at <hi>Whitchurch</hi>; but would never have you make
an Inconvenience of what I would have be a Pleaſure to you—I'd have you
chooſe your own Time, that you may be quite unembarraſſed: for my Part, I
think the ſooner the better; only I would beg the Favour of one Line to
prevent all ill Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents. I think 'tis a Method which ſhould ever be
uſed; and I wonder at my own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, and my own Good Fortune laſt Time
I came to the <hi>Leaſowes.</hi> I long to ſee you, and ſhall be all this

               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:1173200202:68"/> ready to receive you.
Indeed, if I ſhould have the Gout, as I ſomething fear it, I would let you
know, for that would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt all our Pleaſure. I beg my Compliments to Mr.

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU ſee that I am as eager to anſwer your Letter as you was to
anſwer mine, and if my Letter gave you Pain, I aſſure you, that yours has
equally perplexed me. I am <pb n="60" facs="tcp:1173200202:69"/> in great Hopes, you have
miſinterpreted my Senſe, in Regard to Mr. G—; and by as much as I can
recollect, I believe you have. He always ſpeaks of you with the utmoſt
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in your Abſence, and is much leſs ſevere even upon what he
calls your little Faults, than when you are preſent: all that I hinted at,
was ſome little Shyneſs he lately ſhewed to me, on the Account which you
and I have often mentioned. I have heard you ſay, you have experienced the
ſame from him on the like Score. But you could not poſſibly be now
included, being abſent; no, I aſſure you, I only ſpoke of myſelf; and
his Fault towards me would have been imperceptible, but to the Delicacy of
Friendſhip; nor been have worth communicating, but to one whom my Love would
animate againſt the like Failing. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to you, the Sentence which
included Mr. G—'s Name, was the only one which regarded him; what
followed, though I confeſs that gave Riſe to it, was only to ſhew my
different Sentiments, and I own my Eſteem for Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip carried me a
great Length. I have been very particular to ſatisfy you, as well as to
juſtify Mr. G—, and by that Means to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify <pb n="61" facs="tcp:1173200202:70"/>
myſelf. I ſhould have never have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given myſelf, if I had been the
Cauſe, though inadvertently, of dividing ſo much Worth as I have always
diſcovered in you both, and which though ſeparated, it might ſtill
continue to bleſs me, yet when united, like moſt other Things, it has a
more powerful Effect. I would not have Mr. G— know a Word of this, for
the moſt trifling Reflection, when told again, is offenſive; nor ſhould I
have ſaid what I did, but to a common Friend; in Truth, it is not every-body
who poſſibly might feel it ſo acutely as myſelf; but you know my
Diſpoſition. I have a Senſibility in my Friendſhips, that ariſes even
to a <hi>Soreneſs,</hi> and the ſlighteſt Air of Coolneſs makes me
wince. This, though in its Conſequences ſometimes it may render me
unpleaſing to my Intimates, certainly has its Source in a Merit, namely, in
the <hi>Ardour</hi> of my Attachments; and therefore I ſhould hope is
eaſily pardonable. You remember the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Line in COTTON's beautiful
Viſion of Friendſhip; 
<q>"Cold is the only Ill they fear."</q>

had rather an Air of Compliment than Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; if it had, I aſſure you,
it was only the <hi>Air,</hi> and what the Good-humour, I am always in when I
write to you, might inſpire me with. You ſee the Eſteem I have for you,
by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Critic on myſelf in your Behalf. I am now going to mention, what
there is no Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at all to ſay, but Friendſhip is the moſt
incontinent Thing in the World; I have long been ſenſible of your Worth;
that is, ever ſince I knew you; but I muſt ſay, I think it was our laſt
Meeting which entirely united me to you; every Letter of yours ſince has
heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened my Affection for you. I look upon this as my firſt Abſence from
you; your Letters are now neceſſary to ſupply your Preſence; you
yourſelf taught me this Taſte of Luxury, therefore it is but reaſonable
you ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Expence. In ſhort, I beg you would write ſoon.

            <p>I Fancy I've been condemned a Thouſand Times, on Account of not
ſending the Tunes. One of them was lent out, and I had not an Opportunity of
fetching it till laſt Week. I don't know whether this Reaſon will prove
ſufficient, but I aſſure you it was the real one. I tore them out of my
Book, and on that Account you have ſome others with them. I was willing you
ſhould have them in the beſt Shape poſſible, and dare ſay, you'll
improve as much upon them, as I have dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from them.</p>
            <p>I want exceedingly to hear from you; but you will ſcarce think it
conſiſtent with a rural Reputation to write yourſelf. 'Tis, indeed,
ſcarce worth while to hazard it, to give me <pb n="64" facs="tcp:1173200202:73"/> ever ſo
great a Pleaſure, but I could wiſh you would here remember the Character of
a Town-Lady.—Lord! How does Miſs UTY? I did not wonder you ſhould
mutually envy each other, ſince you are both ſo great Objects of Envy: more
particularly, as Modeſty has taught you to think your own Merit ſmall in
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with that of others. <hi>Voilà la ſeule Source de toute
Envie!</hi>—I'm ſurely vaſtly impertinent, for I'm not poſitive you

agreeable Gaiety ſince I left you, whilſt I have been wandering about
<hi>Harborough</hi>'s gloomy Walks and Pools, like a Shepherd 
<q rend="inline">"deſpairing beſide a clear

our Society in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as of our Country in general, it is, and may be
lawful to admit, without the uſual Number of Members being preſent at the

               <salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Promiſed to give you ſome Account what became of
<hi>Cheltenham,</hi> after Mr. A— had pillaged it of all that was moſt
valuable. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly before this Time, you may have forgot both my Promiſe
and me, and it may not be extremely political to renew your Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a
Perſon who has been ſo long ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly neglectful. The Truth is, I can no
more bear to be forgot by thoſe I eſteem, than I <pb n="66" facs="tcp:1173200202:75"/> can
be cenſured of Forgetfulneſs with Regard to them, and I know no Way but
Writing, by which I can evade both.</p>
            <p>Some Sort of Apology I ought to make, that I did not write before;
you will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pleaſe to obſerve, that I am but juſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at
Home, though I left <hi>Cheltenham</hi> the Day after you. I ſtayed, indeed,
to hear Mr. B— preach a Morning Sermon; for which I find Mrs. C— 
has allotted him the Hat, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferably to Mr. C—. Perhaps you may not
remember, nor did I hear till very lately, that there is a Hat given annually
at <hi>Cheltenham,</hi> for the Uſe of the beſt foreign Preacher, of which
the Diſpoſal is aſſigned to Mrs. C—, to her and her Heirs for
ever. I remember (tho' I knew nothing of this whilſt I was upon the Place) I
uſed to be a little miſdeemful, that all who preached there had ſome
ſuch Premium in their Eye. This Hat, 'tis true, is not quite ſo valuable as
that of a <hi>Cardinal,</hi> but while it is made a Retribution for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
in ſo (if properly conſidered) ſublime a Function, it is an Object for a
Preacher in any Degree. I am ſorry, at the ſame Time, <pb n="67" facs="tcp:1173200202:76"/>
to ſay, that as a <hi>common Hat,</hi> merely for its <hi>Uſes,</hi> it
would be an Object to too many <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Curates,</hi> whoſe Situations
and ſlender In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes too often excite our Bluſhes, as well as
Compaſſion. There ſhould be no ſuch Thing as a <hi>Journeyman
Parſon</hi>; it is beneath the Dignity of the Profeſſion. If we had fewer
<hi>Pluralities</hi> in the Church, this Indecorum might, in a great Meaſure,
be aboliſhed.</p>
            <p>Mr. N— (<hi>Squire</hi> N—) I hear is fitting up his
Caſtle at <hi>L—</hi> for the Reception of the little Widow; and the
Mercer at <hi>Cheltenham</hi> has completed his grand Arcade, for the better
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his Crapes and Callimancos.</p>
            <p>I am an ill Relater of Matters of Fact, and as I ſaid before, did
not continue above four and twenty Hours and ſome odd Minutes upon the Place
longer than you that enquire after it: but I ſurvived long enough to hear
very frequent Mention of Mrs. A—, Miſs CARTER, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
ſuch Mention, as has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed me in an Opinion, that Perſons of real

            <p>PERHAPS you may remember to have ſeen an odd Kind of Fellow when
you were at <hi>Cheltenham,</hi> who threatened you with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and who is

lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <pb n="69" facs="tcp:1173200202:78"/> Partiality on his Behalf, having delayed the
Execution of his Menaces for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Time, and even now promiſing
to ſay as few Things in your Favour as the real Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of his Heart will
admit of.</p>
            <p>But Peace to Buffoonery.—After I part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from you, Mr.
M—N, with great Simplicity, endeavoured to keep up my Spirits, by
ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Praiſe of the Family we had left, as though that was not the
ready Method to aggravate the Senſe of one's Loſs; and yet to aggravate it
was utterly impoſſible in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a Perſon already ſo
ſenſible of it. But he mentioned one Article which was more
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, and that was a Propoſal to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me to <hi>Stoke,</hi>
and to let me know when it ſuited his Convenience.</p>
            <p>When I came to <hi>Cheltenham,</hi> I was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of that
ſolemn Vow that I had made, not to ſurvive your Family there a ſingle
Hour: but I found it near five o'Clock, and my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſaid, that as I
had made it ſo late, by my Attendance upon you, though I did ſtay another
Night, I hoped I might be excuſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:1173200202:79"/>I have been, ſince leaving this Town, at Mr.
BROWN's, who lives upon the Borders of <hi>Wales.</hi>—Poor Man! He has
been the moſt obliging Perſon in the World to the moſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid of
Companions. 'Tis hardly poſſible to determine which was greater, the Zeal
with which he ſhewed me his Foſſils, Plants, Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or
the ſtupid Inattention with which I obſerved them. He commends you and Mrs.
AUBREY highly; ſo, indeed, do all I know, or I would ſoon forget that I had
ever ſeen their Faces. He had found out a Method at laſt of ſeducing me
to talk, by frequent Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Merits, and it was a good While before I
diſcovered his Artifice; and even when I had diſcovered it, I was ill able
to elude the Force of it.</p>
            <p>I am now juſt returned Home, which is my Apology for not writing
to you about <hi>Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham</hi> as I promiſed. I really ſcarce recollect
any Circumſtance belonging to it, except that you and Mrs. AUBREY were there
the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, agreeable, and praiſe-worthy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:1173200202:80"/>What, does Mr. M— boaſt of the glorious

Moment of parting, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was little wonderful, in Compariſon of
thoſe I have ſince committed; beſides, his Horſe had a Spot or two of
Brown on him, and was therefore eaſily miſtaken at ſuch a Time for one
that was Sorrel all over.</p>
            <p>After all, you are a very wicked Lady—you defrauded me of the

If you come into <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi> this Summer, I hope you will fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour me

Perhaps you have heard Mr. WHISTLER mention Miſs B—: ſhe died at
<hi>C—</hi> about three Months ſince, after a ſhort Illneſs of two
Days; which added ſo much to the melancholy Situation here, that we were
obliged to fly to Town for Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I came down ten Days ſince, and
ſhall return again to-morrow, for about a Week longer. May I hope, dear Sir,
to find a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here from you? I am ſure the reading of it will give me
more real Pleaſure than any Company or Diverſion I can propoſe to find in
<hi>London.</hi> I am ſorry to ſend you any News that will give you
Concern; but can't help <pb n="76" facs="tcp:1173200202:85"/> telling you, that I hear poor Mr.
R. G— is dangerouſly ill of a Fever in Town. Mr. WHISTLER has left
<hi>Oxford,</hi> on Account of the Small-Pox, which is very much there, and at

            <p>Notwithſtanding this unſeaſonable Weather, I muſt beg leave
to put you in Mind of your Promiſe, and enquire when it is you deſign us

            <p>My beſt, and I think I may ſay, my only dear Lord, Lord

ſlighted a Lady's Favours, you will not neglect a ſincere Friend, who
admires and eſteems you more than (from what I think I have heard you ſay
of her Ladyſhip) <hi>ſhe could.</hi> But to wave this, and leave you to

I not depended on your Promiſe in it, I ſhould have again trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled you

            </opener>
            <p>I MAKE no Doubt, but you will be much ſurpriſed at the Receipt
of this, and like wiſe greatly concerned at the melancholy Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it.
As the Friendſhip ſubſiſting between you and my Brother has been of
ſo long ſtanding, I ſhould be glad to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate its Contents to you
more gently by ſome other Hand; but for Want of a Friend in your
Neighbourhood, who has the Honour of your Acquaintance, muſt do it myſelf
in the leaſt affecting Manner I am capable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:1173200202:91"/>The Beginning of this Month, my Brother was
taken ill of a ſore Throat, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome Days, without any
apparent Symptoms of Danger; indeed, towards the laſt it was judged the
Diſorder was throwing it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf off: but to the great Surpriſe of every
one, a Mortification in his Inſide was then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and came on ſo faſt,
that it was out of the Power of Art, to ſtop it, of which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired the
10th. In <hi>April,</hi> I had the Pleaſure of his Company at
<hi>Briſtol</hi> for a few Days, with my Father, when amongſt other
agreeable Schemes for this Summer's Amuſement, he propoſed to himſelf
very great Pleaſure, from paying Mr. SHENSTONE a Viſit—But Man
propoſes and God diſpoſes. I have loſt a very good kind Brother;
therefore hope thoſe who were his Friends will continue their Friendſhip to
me for his Sake, which I ſhall always endeavour to deſerve. To give you
this melancholy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is a painful Duty; but it is what I am compelled
to pay. I can, in ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, conceive the many afflicting Recollections
which will ariſe in your humane Mind, on this Event! Your Friendſhip and
Correſpondence <pb n="83" facs="tcp:1173200202:92"/> ſubſiſted a conſiderable Time,
and with recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Satisfaction. He was unqueſtionably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with
natural good Senſe, well improved by Education and Reading, of a lively
plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Fancy, and a benevolent Heart. He was, in ſhort, what your Pen
might moſt exquiſitely deſcribe, but what mine is unequal to.</p>
            <p>I beg your Acceptance of a Ring, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him, which
ſhall be conveyed to <hi>Birmingham</hi> the firſt Opportunity. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

written in the Year 1754; that being the Year which deprived him of ſo
valuable a Brother, and Mr. SHENSTONE of ſuch an amiable Friend and
Correſpondent. According to this Calculation, theſe Letters of Mr. WHISTLER
ſhould have come earlier in this Collection, but they did not come Time

               <salute>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</salute>

            <p>I Should with Pleaſure have obeyed your kind Command, and troubled
you with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before this, but that I waited to give you ſome Account of
your Friends here. I ſaw Mr. DODSLEY ſoon after I came to Town; he ſeems
a very good Sort of Man, and I like him much; I believe he is quite ſatisfied
with the Succeſs of his Play, for he is in good Health and Spirits.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Tragedy of <hi>Cleone,</hi> produced at
<hi>Covent-Garden</hi> Theatre.</note> Mr. WREN I could not meet with, till
<hi>Friday</hi> laſt, when I found him very buſy with half a Dozen young
Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts, (for ſuch I preſume they were) and Pen, Ink, and a Ream of
Paper before them; had I been free enough with your Friend, I ſhould
certainly have enquired, what weighty Diſcoveries they had been engaged in,
for they all looked prodigious wiſe when I entered the Room; but I was ſoon
left <hi>Tête-à-Tête</hi> with <pb n="85" facs="tcp:1173200202:94"/> Mr.
W—, and then Subjects of ſtill greater Importance, ſuch as Plays,
Operas, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> were to be diſcuſſed. Without a
Compliment, I think our Friend improves upon Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance much; but I wiſh
him, as you tell him, leſs volatile: to ſay the Truth, when you brought him
to <hi>W—</hi> with K—, he was ſo very alert, that I was not (but
that he came with you) much prejudiced in his Favour; however, I find he has
more Merit than thoſe over-lively young Gentlemen gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have; and I
doubt not, but when you have pruned the Luxuriancy of his Sprightli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he
will make a very good Figure.</p>
            <p>I am ſincerely ſorry, my Congratulations on your having a Place
under Government were premature; but I cannot ſay, I wiſh you, as your
Friend GRIFFITH terms it, <hi>Polaury,</hi> though I know it could not have the
Effect on you, it ſo evidently has had on —: but what any one could
think due to CIBBER's Merit, Mr. SHENSTONE ought to think beneath him.</p>
            <p>I have not the Book you enquired for in yours, nor any one that I
can recollect, from <pb n="86" facs="tcp:1173200202:95"/> you. The Letters you were ſo good as
to ſend me, are ſafe locked up in my Bureau, and ſhall be returned when
we meet; I took the Liberty of keeping them, as I had no Opportunity of
ſending to the <hi>Leaſowes</hi> before I ſet out for <hi>London:</hi> if
you have any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands here, I hope you will oblige me with them, and when you
are at Leiſure, let me hear from you: but DODSLEY tells me, you are
re-peruſing your Elegies, (he hopes for the Preſs) and I would not
interrupt you from ſuch Engagements for the World, as you have too long
deprived the Learned and Taſteful the Pleaſure of admiring them.</p>

Happineſs, even in <hi>London, ought</hi> (I ſhrewdly ſuſpect) to be
that he can call you, and one more <hi>worthy</hi> Man, (you know who I mean)
his Friends. The Pleaſures of <hi>London,</hi> I think I may ſay, the
innocent ones, loſe much of their Power to pleaſe, unleſs participated
with thoſe who have refined Senſe enough to enjoy and partake thoſe
delicate Feelings with a Friend—few ſuch are ever to be found here, and
without ſuch, where's the Society? Diſſipation, my Friend, is the
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <pb n="88" facs="tcp:1173200202:97"/> or chief Amuſement of this Town, to the
Generality of People; and though it abounds with Amuſements and Pleaſures
truly rational, yet by a too frequent, if not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Uſe, theſe very
Pleaſures become irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional; ſuch they are to the Generality of my
Acquaintance, and though I hope I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be wiſer than they, yet
I cannot feel a Pleaſure in going with them to Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the

to draw off the Attention of others, to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion or ſelf; for this

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU make me very happy, by the kind Turn you give to the
unfaſhionable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve I told you in my laſt I labour under. I am
ſincerely deſirous of being dear to you; and if the 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>eadem velle atque eadem nolle</hi>"</q> is a
good Omen of a laſting Friendſhip, I have good Reaſons to hope, that the
Names of W. SHENSTONE and A. B— will ever be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually eſteemed by each
other; for without meaning a Compliment, but to my own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I really
think, to know what you like or diſlike, ſome <hi>few</hi> Perſons
excepted, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make me do the ſame: but I beg for the future,
when you mention the Valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles <hi>London</hi> robs the Country of, at this
Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, you will not immediately add, that Lord P— is juſt ſet out
from <hi>N—</hi> on his Way here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:1173200202:103"/>
               <hi>A-propos!</hi> You tell me you are buſy
in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating your Library; will not you laugh at me, if I draw a
Compariſon, and tell you that I am engaged at preſent in a ſimilar
Affair? Regulating the Friends I henceforward deſign admitting into my
Heart's inmoſt Receſs. You, I dare ſay, even in <hi>your</hi> Library
have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome Rubbiſh, you will now throw out; how much then muſt
I, who from a very Child have been a Kind of Enthuſiaſt in Friendſhip,
have to cleanſe from my Eſteem? Indeed, I find upon Examination, I have
been much out in my Collection, and have ranked many <hi>fuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Pamphlets,</hi> as JOHNSON calls them, as Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Authors; but I ſhall
make a total Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and hope, for the future, my Taſte will be more
refined; indeed, I do not fear it, for I have choſen your Worſhip ſole
Librarian of the Place; and to ſay the Truth, I find you ſo delicate a
Gentleman, that you have routed every other living Soul, (my own
<hi>neareſt</hi> Relations excepted) nor can I find that you will admit any
one elſe to enter the poor Cell you have the Charge of but Lord D—:
well, well, you are quite right; I ſhall have enough <pb n="95" facs="tcp:1173200202:104"/> to
do to value you two as I ought; you <hi>two</hi> ſhall be my Study, and if I
don't improve enough from reading you, it will be my Fault: for the Pamphlets,
I ſhall dip into them oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, at an idle Hour, unleſs a female one
demands my cloſer Application; but I promiſe you, I ſhall be very
cautious in my Choice of her.</p>
            <p>I am much obliged to you, for offering to introduce me to the
Acquaintance of Dr. G—. I ſhould eagerly lay hold of the Favour, but
that I purpoſe leaving <hi>London</hi> on <hi>Monday</hi> the 26th of this
Month, and ſhall not have Time to pay him the Attention I owe every Friend of
Mr. SHENSTONE's.</p>
            <p>I have from your Recommendation read the Hiſtory of <hi>La
Pompadour,</hi> and like it very well; it ſeems authentic, though not much to
the Honour of the <hi>Dame</hi> or <hi>Louis le Grand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall expect two Letters from your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in anſwer to my
laſt Nonſenſe and <hi>this,</hi> and pray, good Sir, do be not ſo very
conciſe. Mr. SHENSTONE, believe me, is worſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany <pb n="96" facs="tcp:1173200202:105"/>
than any Man, when <hi>he</hi> is ſilent; moſt People know how agreeable
every Word he ſays is, and when he is pleaſed to be mute, cannot but be
uneaſy. According to this, you'll ſay, your Friend wiſhes you to kill
yourſelf with talking; not ſo—but he refers the Whole to your better
Judgment, who knows beſt (when your modeſt Humility does not too much
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere) how to do every Thing with the beſt Grace.</p>
            <p>If you have by you your <hi>Ode on Autumn,</hi> or <hi>Damon's
Bower,</hi> and care to truſt them by the Bearer, you will do me a great
Favour in ſending them. If you can venture out of your agreeable
<hi>Shell</hi> at the <hi>Leaſowes,</hi> and (provided you are preparing your
Elegies for the Preſs) will bring them with you, not letting the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour you
do us delay the Pleaſure you will give the polite World in publiſhing them,
we ſhall think ourſelves happy in accommodating you with a warm Room, Pen,
Ink and Paper, in this Part of the World.</p>
            <p>I return the Ducheſs of SOMERSET's Letters, which I have peruſed
with great Pleaſure, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <pb n="97" facs="tcp:1173200202:106"/> thoſe which give

<hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> the Sheets you have ſo obligingly ſent me, puts me
ſo much in Mind of MOLIERE's reading his Plays to his old Woman, before he

my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though I am but juſt turned twenty-ſeven, and have a good Pair
of Mr. DEHENNIC's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite <hi>Lambſkin</hi> Breeches on, that I am not of

you my Opinion freely, (which you will find firſt interſperſed on little
Bits of Paper, among your Proof-Sheets) and I deſire you will not eſteem it
in any other Light. I am vain enough of the Friendſhip you have
diſtinguiſhed me with, and I deſire you will not let your kind Partiality
make me more unworthy of it than I am, by adding to my Vanity. As a Poet I
admire, and as a Friend I love you: but you muſt not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to me, for what I
am not able, with any Credit to myſelf, to oblige you in. I am glad you
ſent DODSLEY's fourth Volume, as I parted with my Set of his Poems this
Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to a Friend, who begged them of me. Am much obliged to you, for the

            <p>I Am very ſorry you have been ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed ſince I
left you. Bleeding, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, Purging, the Doctor, and the Diſeaſe, are
too many Enemies for a Man to ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with at once; and I heartily wiſh
you Joy of your Victory againſt ſuch apparent Odds. I am ſure, I have
very little Reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, you make Sickneſs a Plea for

Fame as you do to theirs, and the World will be obliged to you.</p>
            <p>I received a Letter from Mr. EAVES; he tells me, the Fables are

you in his firſt Letter, and alſo by a Line from Miſs H—: but by a

I received ſome Hopes of your Recovery, tho' not enough to encourage me to

that you are better, and when you are able to write yourſelf, I ſhall be

            </opener>
            <p>I AM ſorry I hurried my Eſſay out of your Hands, before you
had done with it; but if I think of publiſhing my Fables next
<hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober</hi> or <hi>November,</hi> it is high Time I ſhould put both to
Preſs now, that the Printer may have good Weather to print in, and that the
Work may have Time to dry, after it is finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before the Books are bound.
But as it <pb n="104" facs="tcp:1173200202:113"/> happens, I cannot begin till the latter End of
this Month, as the Printer is not at Leiſure; however, I have put my Plates
in Hand, and they are going on as faſt as poſſible. I never received Mr.
ALCOCK's Drawings; ſo I have got two others executed, of ſomewhat a
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Deſign. I will not put the Eſſay in Hand till the laſt,
which may, perhaps, be about <hi>July,</hi> as I ſhall be very deſirous of
its having the Advantage of your Corrections. But am I not to hope for a new
Fable or two from you? You ſee how I dwindle in my Expectations: but pray
don't let me be <hi>quite</hi> diſappointed. I propoſe, if poſſible, to
finiſh the Printing of my Fables before I ſet out on my northern
Expedition. Mr. M—, and his Lady, will be at <hi>Nottingham</hi> about
the latter End of <hi>Auguſt</hi>; they have wiſhed I would meet them
there, and in their Return to Town, bring them round by the
<hi>Leaſowes.</hi> Mr. BURKE<note n="*" place="bottom">Author of <hi>the
Sublime and Beautiful.</hi>
               </note> has alſo a ſtrong Inclination to meet us
there; ſo that poſſibly we may be happy enough to ſpend a Day with you;
another muſt be ſpent at Lord LYTTELTON's, (as they are both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted 
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1173200202:114"/> with him) and a third at <hi>Birmingham.</hi> I ſhall
hate the Name of D— as long as I live: he is crooked in all his Ways; but
the Devil will ſet ſtrait with him one Day or other. I have not ſeen a
Page of Mr. PERCY's Novel, and therefore cannot at all explain it to you; but I
ſuppoſe he makes no Secret of it. I wiſh Mr. GRAVES would finiſh
his.—And will you really conſent to an Exchange of Pictures? Upon my
Word, you make but a ſorry Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for yourſelf: however, to give you as
little Reaſon as may be to regret your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, I will ſit to one of
our beſt Artiſts; and to ſupply the Want of Merit in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, will
endeavour to give as much as I can to the Copy. If you have any Thing to
ſuggeſt on this Subject, (as you ſeem to hint) you will be ſo good as
to let me have a Line, becauſe, as ſoon as I am able to get abroad, which I
hope will be in a few Days, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to conſult with REYNOLDS<note n="*" place="bottom">The preſent Sir JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</note> about it. Ay, I forgot
to tell you, that I have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined this Month with the Gout; every Man has

Likeneſs is a ſtrong one; and I think the Attitude, you are drawn in, is a
good one: pray, is that the Picture you intend for me? The Writer of
<hi>Triſtram Shandy</hi> is a Mr. STERNE, one of the Prebendaries of
<hi>York.</hi> As to Mr. BASKERVILLE's <hi>Bible,</hi> he will eaſily be
diſſuaded from the marginal Ornaments; but the Title-Page is a Favourite,
and for my Part, I have not much Objection to it. Mr. WEBB's Book, on
<hi>Painting and Painters,</hi> is reckoned ingenious, and if you like the
Subject, will be worth your Peruſal. <hi>Antient and Modern Rome,</hi> I

            <p>I WAS yeſterday ſearching for Figures for your two
Niches—I have found three Pair, the Figures good, that will do as to
Size, <hi>viz.</hi> the ANTINOUS I mentioned, and the APOLLO with his Arm over
his Head; a FLORA and a CERES; and a HOMER and VIRGIL. The ANTINOUS and APOLLO
are two Feet high, FLORA and CERES twenty-three Inches, and HOMER and VIRGIL
twenty-one. Theſe laſt are each of them leaning upon a Pedeſtal; on one
of which, in <hi>Baſſo Relievo,</hi> is <hi>Troy</hi> in Flames; on the
other, ROMULUS and REMUS ſucking a Wolf. Theſe are both pretty Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures;
and don't you think them better Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments for a Library, and more ſuitable
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions for SAPPHO, than either of the others? A Line by the Return of the

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1173200202:117"/> finiſhed, and ſent to you, before I ſet off for
<hi>Nottingham,</hi> for I find I muſt go thither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the

my Friend Mr. M—, by the laſt Poſt, who is at <hi>Nottingham,</hi>
and I find him wavering in his Reſolutions, about coming by the
<hi>Leaſowes.</hi> I am glad you like my Deſign for the Picture: and how
agreeably you have contrived to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me about it! But ſay what you will,
I ſhall have a Picture of Mr. SHENSTONE; you will have one only of DODSLEY;
and a SHEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STONE by ALCOCK, will certainly be more valuable than a DODSLEY even
by REYNOLDS. I read to him that Part of your Letter which related to him; he
deſires his Compliments, and would be glad, if you came to Town, that you
ſate to him. I hope I ſhall be able to ſend the Picture to you, before I

            <p>HOW much am I obliged to you for the Pains you have taken in
tranſlating LA MOTTE's Diſcourſe on Fable! and though I fancy you will
find, upon comparing the two, that I have made a good Deal of Uſe of it, I
ſhall be very glad to have more of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven, if you ſhall think I
have not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently extracted the Eſſence of it. I muſt muſt own,
my Pride (or call it my Folly, if you pleaſe) would rather chooſe to prefix
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of my own on that Subject, than ſervilely adopt the Thoughts of a
<hi>Frenchman,</hi> though I acknowledge them to be very ingenious. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
I have had the Hardineſs to differ with him in ſome Reſpects, which makes
it ſtill more improper to take his whole Diſcourſe. Proceed, therefore,
if you pleaſe, in correcting my Eſſay; and interweave with it as much 
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1173200202:119"/> more of LA MOTTE as you may think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. If you defer
this till I come down, which I wiſh you would not, pray in the mean Time
think of half a Dozen new Fables, that we may not have too much to embarraſs
us when together. My Face is quite finiſhed, and I believe very like. I fancy
I ſhall ſend it, together with the Figures, on <hi>Monday</hi> Se'en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night;
but I ſhall not be able to ſet out myſelf till <hi>Monday</hi> Fortnight,
and ſtaying a Week or ten Days at <hi>Nottingham</hi> and <hi>Mansfield,</hi>
will detain me from the <hi>Leaſowes</hi> till the latter End of next Month.
If the Picture ſhould be turned yellowiſh, by being packed up, Mr. REYNOLDS
adviſes, that it be ſet in the Sun for two Hours, which will quite recover
it. Why did you leave the Choice of your two Figures to me? How could you put
me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a Difficulty? If I have done wrong, you will ſuffer for it;
and ſay what you will, I have not ſufficient Firmneſs of Taſte to
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me right; beſides, I do not exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Niches: it is
therefore your Fault to truſt me; and if I have erred, your Duty to forgive
me. I have ordered the HOMER and VIRGIL to be bronzed: they are very pretty 
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1173200202:120"/> Figures; and if you have, as you ſay, no other
Objection to them, but the Want of two or three Inches more of Height, I hope
ſome Means may be found to obviate ſo ſmall a Deficiency. I ſhould not,
however, have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to ſend them, but that you ſeemed, at laſt, to
acquieſce in their being ſent. I think, however, I have been ſomewhat
happy in my Urns; and I am not without Hopes, that you will approve the whole
Cargo. The Folio-VIRGIL will come in the ſame Package. I feel myſelf very
happy in the Thoughts of ſeeing you ſoon, and will haſten the Day as much
as is in my Power. I hope Mr. BAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KERVILLE will be quite ready for me; I
ſhall ſend him the Paper in a Fortnight. I am</p>

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR Picture really affords me many plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Reflections, and I
have ordered the Frame to be full gilt, whilſt I am out of Town, that it may
not give you any unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ones. I am going to <hi>Derby</hi> and
<hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham</hi> for three Weeks or a Month: I can't ſtay longer, as I
muſt attend to the Preſs, having put my Fables in Hand for a new Edition. I
have laſt <hi>Monday</hi> ſent you PERCY's Novel; I ſent it unbound, as
we had not Time to bind it: it will not be publiſhed till the Beginning of
next Winter. I have ſent you the <hi>Fables,</hi> bound in <hi>Morocco,</hi>
and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Edition in Boards, for your future Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections: but I would
not have you begin till you ſee the next Edition, as I hope you will find it
altered ſomewhat for the better; I will ſend you one of them as ſoon as
it is printed. <pb n="113" facs="tcp:1173200202:122"/> You will find, likewiſe, in the Parcel,
SOAME JENNYNS's Works, and a Pamphlet or two; alſo the Fables, with your
Drawings in them, many of which I like extremely; that at the Head of the
ſecond I approve the leaſt: but thoſe that are placed in the Life, I
think ſhould be transferred to the Head and Tail-Pieces of the
Fables—but there will be Time enough to talk of this hereafter. As to
Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, I believe I ſhall ſteer a middle Courſe, and make Uſe only of
a few. I ſend you a Liſt of ſome Statues, about the ſame Size with that
Pair you have; 
<list>
                  <item>DEMOSTHENES and CICERO,</item>
                  <item>LOCKE and NEWTON,</item>
                  <item>CHAUCER and SPENCER,</item>
                  <item>SHAKESPEARE and MILTON.</item>
               </list> When you have fixed upon which Pair you will have, you will
let me know whether you will have them white or bronzed, and what Kind of a
Bronze.</p>
            <p>I really don't know how to appeaſe Mr. W—. I told him, I was
very ſorry I had pretended to meddle with his Ode, and begged 
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1173200202:123"/> his Pardon. He is ſtill unappeaſed, writes me
another angry Letter, and deſires me to give him my Reaſons for every
Alteration; this it is impoſſible for me to do, as I have forgot how it
originally was; and I really think it of very little Conſequence, as no Name
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to it.</p>
            <p>Mr. STUART is juſt now with me, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires his Compliments. He
thinks of ſeeing your Place the latter End of the Summer, and believes the
Attorney-General, Mr. PRATT, will be with him. I have juſt been ſtruck with
the bad News, that Mr. — has loſt his Wife. You will perceive I write
in a Hurry; Mr. STUART ſits by me.</p>

            <head>LETTER XXXVI. W. SHENSTONE, Eſq. to Mr. HULL, at
<hi>Birmingham.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I DESIRE my Compliments to Mr. HULL and Miſs MORRISON, with many
Thanks for the Pleaſure I received from laſt Night's Play.<note n="*" place="bottom">A haſty and imperfect Compilation of ſome Scenes, on the
Subject of ROSAMOND, which, however, laid the Ground-Work of the preſent
Tragedy, acted at <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> Theatre. The Public may eaſily
diſcern how fully the Author has availed himſelf of the kind and judicious
Hints contained in the Letter before us.</note> It was, indeed, acted with
great Spirit, and as far as I could judge, afforded the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience no ſmall
Satisfaction—not, perhaps, equal to what they derived from the Appearance
of the Dun Cow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Introduced in a
Pantomime performed the ſame Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> for that is hardly to be
expected.</p>
            <p>I think the Play has now ſo much <hi>good</hi> in it, that it may
be worth Mr. HULL's while <pb n="116" facs="tcp:1173200202:125"/> to give it a few more
finiſhing Touches. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Confeſſor or Friar, either out of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
to the Queen, view to his own Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Motive
(which he might explain in a ſhort Soliloquy) perſuaded ROSA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOND to
aſpire to the Throne, and to urge the King to a Divorce; that ROSAMOND
ſhould avow her Abhorrence of ſuch Injuſtice to the Queen, intimating,
that her Love had no other Object than the King's Perſon and heroic Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;
that this Refuſal ſhould affront the Friar, who in Revenge ſhould inform
the Queen, that ROSAMOND actually <hi>had</hi> thoſe very Intentions with
which he had been endeavouring to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This would
throw more Plot into the Play, (which it wants) would more ſufficiently
account for the Queen's ſudden Change from a mild Character to a revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
one, and, as Mr. HULL thinks the Play too ſhort, would add two new Scenes.
Some further Improvements I would recommend in the Cloſe, and a few more
Places; but Mr. HULL's further <hi>Attention</hi> to the Play, will render it
need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to point them out to him.</p>
            <p>If you ſhould ever complete this Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your Liking, and
produce the Piece <pb n="117" facs="tcp:1173200202:126"/> on a <hi>London</hi>-Stage, I would
recommend, that you ſhould by all Means give it a double Title in the printed
Bills; namely, HENRY <hi>the Second, or the Fall of</hi> ROSAMOND.</p>
            <p>I ſhould eſteem it as a Favour, if Mr. HULL would ſend me down
a Copy of the Prologue and Epilogue as they were ſpoken; which I will not
communicate without his Permiſſion. Either his or Miſs MORRISON's Muſe
ſeems to favour them at a Minute's Warning.</p>
            <p>Mr. HODGETTS, with whom I am at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, would be glad that Mr.
HULL would dine here, about two; and ſo ſhould I, if it be no way
inconvenient to him.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgot to thank you for the Stanzas you left at the
<hi>Leaſowes,</hi> when I was on a Viſit to <hi>Hagley.</hi> They are well

Senſibility, warmed with honeſt Indignation.</p>

               <salute>Dear Mr. HULL,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF I recollect aright, both you and NED ALCOCK were here this laſt
Autumn, on the Evening when my Fiſh-Ponds had been robbed, and the Fiſh
deſtroyed. You were an Eye-Witneſs of the Circumſtances, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot but retain them in your Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I find I have been arraigned of
<hi>Lenity,</hi> by ſeveral conſcientiouſly-upright Neighbours. 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>I have ſcreened a Robber from
Juſtice</hi>;"—"<hi>I have given Encouragement to future Thefts,</hi>"
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Such are the Aſperſions wherewith I have 
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1173200202:130"/> been loaded. I make a material Diſtinction between a
<hi>Robber</hi> and a <hi>Pilferer</hi>; nor can I aſſign the former
Appellation to a poor Wretch, who, in his Hunger, has taken two or three
<hi>Fiſhes,</hi> or as many <hi>Loaves.</hi> It is true, I would rather have
given more than the Value of them, to have prevented my <hi>finny Friends</hi>
being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed in, or taken away, from their elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Habitation; it is
alſo as true, that, in my firſt Warmth, on the Report that the Fellow had
bruiſed the poor Creatures to Death againſt the Stumps and Roots of Trees,
I could not only have delivered him over to Juſtice, but have been almoſt
induced to become myſelf his Puniſher; but when that Warmth ſubmitted to
cool Reflection, <hi>I felt it impoſſible</hi> to reſiſt his Argument,
of having a Wife with five Children at Home, and not a Doit to procure them a
Meal. I verily believe too he ſpoke the Truth. Poverty and Affliction
ſeemed to work and plead within him, and his Words were the Words of
Nature.</p>
            <p>I cannot be ſo ſevere againſt theſe petty Miſdemeanours as
many are; nor can I, though I revere the Call of Juſtice, be a rigorous 
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1173200202:131"/> Supporter of its Claims, except in atrocious Caſes.
Beſide, what had it availed me, to have conſigned the Offender to the Power
of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate? Rather ſay, what Pain and Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience ſhould I not
have entailed on myſelf? I ſhould have had the Trouble of attending the
Examination; have had the Fellow impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned many Days; and the additional
Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of travelling, perhaps to <hi>Warwick,</hi> or
<hi>Worceſter,</hi> in order to convict him. And after all, no Reſtitution
is made for my Loſs, though it were ten Times more valuable than a whole
<hi>Draught of Fiſhes.</hi> There is ſurely ſomething deficient in our
Laws, concerning the <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum</hi>; the Perſon robbed not only
abides the Loſs without Amends, but is even put to Expence, as well as
Inconvenience, to get the Robber puniſhed.</p>
            <p>Then again, the Wife and five Children!—The poor Fellow
ſubſiſts, chief Part of the Year, only by carrying News-Papers round the
Country. Had He been ſhut up, what was to have ſupported the ragged Family
meanwhile? I am beſide inclined to think, that half a Crown, and a little
wholeſome Admonition, <pb n="123" facs="tcp:1173200202:132"/> that is, if he be not a
practiſed and ſtubborn Offender, might go as far towards amending his
Morals, as an Acquaintance with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of a Priſon, and the
Converſation of ſuch Aſſociates as he might find there.</p>
            <p>I have ſuffered myſelf ſometimes to doubt the Excellence of
our Laws, relative to Life and Death, notwithſtanding I know it has been
aſſerted by many People, that they are wiſer than thoſe of any other
Nation. What then? Is the Man who takes a few Guineas from you on the Highway,
on a Level with him who commits a deliberate Murder? And is there no
Puniſhment to be found more ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the firſt Tranſgreſſion,
than taking away the Life? Surely, one Example made by a viſible Brand, a
Mark of Diſgrace, which could never be waſhed away, would more avail
towards the Prevention of future Crimes, than half the Executions in the
Kingdom, which have now, from two great Frequency, loſt the chief Part of
their Purpoſe and Terror. The Puniſhment which was inflicted by a Regent in
ſome Part of the Eaſt, (I think the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is related in the
<hi>Arabian Nights Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments)</hi>

               <salute>Dear Mr. HULL,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I ESTEEM myſelf beholden to you, for having made me acquainted
with the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the two Writers, Dr. LANCASTER and HENRY. I have admired
them both in their Pages, but knew only their Names. In fact, when I firſt
read the <hi>Eſſay on Delicacy,</hi> I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined the Name of LANCASTER to
be ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and that the Work might be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Author of
<hi>Sir Thomas Fitz-Oſhorne's Letters.</hi> There is great Spirit, fine
Sentiment, and true Elegance of Style through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and my Friend DODSLEY's
preſerving it in his <hi>Fugitive Pieces</hi> is truly meritorious. It well
deſerves to be reſcued from Oblivion. But what a Pity that your Uncle does
not make a more frequent Uſe of his Pen! the World does not abound too much
in ſuch Writers. <pb n="133" facs="tcp:1173200202:142"/> How much likewiſe is it to be
lamented, that a Man of ſuch Abilities ſhould lie concealed in an obſcure
Part of <hi>Eſſex!</hi> He ſhould have remained in the World—that
is, I mean, for the Sake of the World; to his own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, probably,
Retirement was moſt condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive. It is moſt certain, that no Men are fit for
Solitude, but thoſe who find the Source of Amuſement and Employment in
themſelves. Fancy, Reflection, and a Love of Reading, are indiſpenſably
neceſſary for ſuch a Situation. It is downright Lunacy for a Man who has
paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Life in a Compting-Houſe, or a Shop; who poſſeſſes,
poſſibly, but a moderate Share of natural Underſtanding, that
Underſtanding too not cultivated by Education, and who has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known what
it is was to look into a Book—It is, I repeat, downright Lunacy, for
ſuch a Man to think of <hi>retiring.</hi> He knows not, the Fatigue he is
going to encounter: he will want Employment for his Hours; moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
may ſhorten his Exiſtence, and while he retains it, it will be one
continued State of Apathy, if not Diſorder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:1173200202:143"/>HENRY, you ſay, is a Mr. GRIFFITH, of the
County of <hi>Kilkenny</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> A Friend brought me over the
Letters of HENRY and FRANCES, when they were firſt publiſhed in
<hi>Dublin</hi>; they are moſt admirably clever and comprehenſive; I have
enjoyed and re-enjoyed them; and while I have admired the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, have loved
the Writers. In the private Character you have given me of this amiable
<hi>Pair,</hi> I feel as if I were acquainted with them. Before the Information
received from you, I have ſometimes ſuffered myſelf to think, and even
communicated to an intimate Friend or two, that there was a Similitude of
Diſpoſition between HENRY and myſelf; but when I look on your
Deſcription of him, I entertain much Doubt. In the active Parts of his
Philoſophy, his Perſeverance, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, I fear I am far behind
him. He is a Man qualified for any State or Situation; Buſineſs or
Amuſement, Solitude or a Crowd.—And you have ſpent Months with him at
<hi>Kilkenny!</hi>—I give you Joy of ſuch an Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM greatly obliged both to you and Miſs MORRISON, for the
Ballads you were ſo good as to incloſe to me. The Speed you have uſed in
ſending them, teſtifies the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of that Delight you ſeemed to
expreſs at the <hi>Leaſowes,</hi> when I firſt communicated my Friend Dr.
PERCY's Deſign. I ſent them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly <pb n="136" facs="tcp:1173200202:145"/> to him; he has
begun to print off his venerable Collection,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Antient Poetry,</hi> now publiſhed in three Volumes; the
univerſal Eſtimation and Encouragement of which Work, ſufficiently
teſtifies its Excellence.</note> with an Eye to the Publication of it
ſometime next Winter. One of your Ballads is truly beautily and extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proper for his Purpoſe. It has that <hi>Nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veté,</hi> which is ſo
very eſſential in Ballads of all Kind; and which requires no more than,
that <hi>ſublime,</hi> or <hi>elegant,</hi> or <hi>tender</hi> Sentiments be
expreſſed in a ſimple and unaffected Manner—<hi>Sentimental</hi>
Language would be no ill Term for it; or, perhaps, the Eſſay before
DODSLEY's <hi>Fables</hi> does not improperly ſtile it, the <hi>Voice</hi> of
Sentiment, in Oppoſition to the <hi>Language</hi> of Reflection.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>other,</hi> Miſs M— well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes,
that the Merit of it is almoſt wholly confined to the Sentiment at laſt.
This is both <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>tender</hi>; and would <hi>ſhe</hi>
take the Pains to new-write the <hi>whole</hi> on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, (for even this
Sentiment is not <hi>expreſſed</hi> ſo very ſimply as one could wiſh
it) I dare ſay it is in her Power to render it very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. 
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1173200202:146"/> I know not how far I am <hi>ſingular</hi>; but as I
love to avail myſelf of different Words, to bundle up Ideas in different
Parcels, it is become habitual to me, to call <hi>that</hi> a <hi>Ballad</hi>
which deſcribes or implies ſome <hi>Action</hi>; on the other Hand, I term
that a <hi>Song,</hi> which contains only an Expreſſion of
<hi>Sentiment.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Account, I believe one of your Pieces
would appear a <hi>Ballad,</hi> and the other a <hi>Song.</hi>

thoſe who chuſe to compound the Matter betwixt <hi>Indolence</hi> and
<hi>Curioſity.</hi> Mr. GARRICK has given a very genteel Turn to this Taſte
among the Citizens, in his Epilogue to the new Play.<note n="*" place="bottom">Epilogue to the Tragedy of <hi>Hecuba,</hi> produced that Year at
<hi>Drury-Lane</hi> Theatre.</note> I have not <hi>yet</hi> ſeen this
Performance; and ſhould be glad if you would give me ſome Account of its
Appearance on the Stage. Why does not <hi>your</hi> Dr. LANCAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER 
<note n="†" place="bottom">The Editor's Uncle.</note> compleat
his <hi>Eſſay upon Delicacy?</hi> I read it, ſince I wrote laſt, in
DODSLEY's <hi>Fugitive</hi>

               <hi>Pieces,</hi> and think
it mighty well deſerves the Labour neceſſary to its Continuation.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that Specimens of Wit or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour have been diſpenſed
this Winter but ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly from the Preſs; and even there in
<hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical</hi> Pamphlets, where I am leaſt inclined to ſeek them. But
we muſt ſwim with the Tide, if we would collect the Shells and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals that
it leaves behind; accordingly I have read two or three of theſe Pamphlets
which have anſwered my Expectations. Should any other appear that ſtrikes
you, be ſo good as to encloſe it to me in a Frank. As to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinia,</hi>
or other dramatic Schemes, I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them till I ſee you again at the
<hi>Leaſowes,</hi> which whenever it happens, will afford me Pleaſure,

            <opener>
               <dateline>The <hi>Leaſowes,</hi> 
                  <date>
                     <hi>Dec.</hi> 8, 1761.</date>
               </dateline> 
               <salute>Dear Miſs M—,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I OUGHT to have returned Thanks for your agreeable Account of the
Excurſion to <hi>Chepſtow,</hi> ſome Time ago; but theſe are Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which I do not always perform ſo ſoon as I ought—you know I
don't—Neither will I waſte my Time and Paper in apologizing for a
Failing which you are ſo ready to forgive, <pb n="144" facs="tcp:1173200202:153"/> convinced
that I am not leſs grateful on that Account.</p>
            <p>I have great Joy in reading theſe little pleaſurable Travels, in
a private Letter, related, as yours are, without Formality, deſcribing, with
Eaſe and Simplicity, every little Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as it falls out. I can journey
with you in Imagination, and partake every trivial Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and every
Delight. <hi>You</hi> are fond of theſe little <hi>Parties of
Pleaſure,</hi> as they are called, and in you it is, by no Means, reprovable;
but in general, they are very dangerous to young Folks. <hi>You</hi> have Means
and Time, at your own Diſpoſal; your Party is ſmall and ſelect, both in
Point of Reputation and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; you likewiſe turn your Excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to ſome Advantage; you make Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on all you ſee, form nice
Diſtinctions between different Places, Points, and Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and draw
juſt Concluſions from them—But, as I ſaid before, theſe Parties
too often are hazardous; the Mind once indulged in them, is apt to covet them
too often; they are ſometimes the Means of drawing a Female into improper
Company; they encroach on <pb n="145" facs="tcp:1173200202:154"/> Means and Time, neither of
which, probably, can with Propriety be beſtowed; they have their Source in
Diſſipation, are continually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Hazard, and too often end in
the Worſt of Miſchiefs. In ſhort, I would wiſh all young Folks, who
have neither Leiſure nor Money at Command, to ſhut their Ears againſt the
very Name of <hi>a Party of Pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More than once in my Life, I have been ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by Friends to
viſit foreign Climes. I had an Invitation of this Kind lately; but it is now
too late; at leaſt, I think ſo—Beſides, why ſhould a Man go ſo
far for Objects of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, who has ſeen too little of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?
Many Parts of <hi>England, Wales</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> equally (I
ſhould think) deſerve our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and we need not riſque Winds and
Waves, to which I feel <hi>ſome</hi> Objection. Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our travelling
Gentry peregrinate too early in Life, before the Mind is ſufficiently formed
to make proper Obſervations on what they ſee and hear.</p>
            <p>A Friend once related an Anecdote, which is appoſite to my
Subject. A very young <pb n="146" facs="tcp:1173200202:155"/> Man, of good natural
Underſtanding, and Heir to an affluent Fortune, would needs be one of theſe
inconſiderate Travellers. In the Courſe of his Adventures, he fell into
Company, in <hi>Naples,</hi> with ſome well-travelled, and well-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Foreigners. They were converſing on what they had ſeen in <hi>England</hi>;
and ſome little Difference in Opinion ariſing about the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture of
<hi>Windſor</hi>-Caſtle, they naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred themſelves to the young
<hi>Engliſhman</hi> for Deciſion. With much Confuſion and Heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he was compelled to confeſs, he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen the Building in Queſtion.
The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, with true foreign Politeneſs, only teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their
Admiration in a ſilent Smile—but the Reflection inſtantly ſtruck,
and pained the young Gentleman. The Reſult was, that he returned for
<hi>England</hi> within two Days, rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined to inſtruct
himſelf in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his own Country, before he pryed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe
afar off. His Reflection and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination did equal Credit to his
Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Our Friend HULL has, as uſual, been amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us with as good a
Drama, as our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Town can give Encouragement to; 
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1173200202:156"/> but ſays, he returns no more. I know many who will be
ſorry on this Account. He has not departed, however, without having excited
Curioſity in a very peculiar Way; on a ſmall Plan, indeed, but to a very
commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Purpoſe. He enticed with him his two principal Actreſſes,
Miſs MORRISON and Miſs IBBOT, (both poſſeſſed of great Merit in
their Profeſſion) ſome few of his Band, two Voices, and gave an Evening's
Entertainment of <hi>Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Reading,</hi> at the little Town of
<hi>Stour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> ſome few Miles off; the Profits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the
Aſſiſtance of a Tradeſman, who had ſuffered under repeated
Misfortunes. The Succeſs, I hear, more than anſwered his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations; the
little Aſſembly-Room was croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with much good Company. A ſlight
Cold made me fearful of being out late, but the Particulars were given me by a
neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Clergyman who was preſent. The Pieces ſelected for Reading
were well-choſen. I do not remember the whole Number, but I recollect that
<hi>Miſs</hi> CARTER<hi>'s Ode to Wiſdom,</hi> PRIOR<hi>'s Henry and
Emma,</hi> and GRAY's <hi>Elegy in a Country Church-Yard</hi> were amongſt
them. The latter gave particular Satisfaction, my <pb n="148" facs="tcp:1173200202:157"/> Friend
told me, to the Gentlemen of the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, of whom he counted ſeven. The whole
was received with great Approbation. You are to obſerve that HULL and his
Party, ſo far from propoſing any Emolument to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, declined even
to be re-imburſed the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences they were at in going, and the Maſter of
the Aſſembly-Room <hi>gave</hi> the Uſe of it. From this confined
Inſtance of ſuch a Scheme, I am apt to think an Union of Poetry and
Muſic, executed on a larger Plan, would be an admirable
Two-Hours-Entertainment, either in a public Room or private Family.</p>
            <p>I encloſe a Piece of Writing, which a Friend of mine ſent me in
a Frank laſt Week. I think the Subject calculated for your Liking. It was
planned, and partly written, in Mr. HOARE's lovely Grounds, at
<hi>Stourton</hi> in <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>; and the Thought ſuggeſted by
ſurvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from an Eminence there, a woody Vale, wherein ALFRED is reported
to have once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed himſelf from the <hi>Danes.</hi> Send it back, when
you have done with it.</p>

            <p>IT gives me the greateſt Pleaſure, that I have an Opportunity of
conveying to a Perſon of your Taſte, the incloſed Fragments of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient

But Thanks to the Taſte and Care of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Tranſlator, that we have
not to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the utter Loſs of thoſe Pieces, which reflect ſo much
Luſtre on the Memory of the original Bards. Here we ſee Poets framed by the
Hand of Nature; their Manners rude and <pb n="168" facs="tcp:1173200202:177"/> uncultivated, as
the Wilds they inhabited; unacquainted with ARISTOTLE and HORACE, but pouring
the (I had almoſt ſaid) involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Effuſions of Minds filled with true
poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Fire, deeply intereſted in the Themes they ſung, devoid of all
Rules, they attach and warm the Heart, by an amazing though ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Power,
the conſtant Effect of copying Nature, but copying her juſtly; to which the
languid Efforts of Art bear ſcarce ſo inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting a Proportion, as the
Shadow to the Subſtance.</p>
            <p>From the general Structure of the Poetry, from the Names of the
Perſons celebrated in it, and the Hints of the <hi>Coſtume</hi> ſcattered
here and there, it would appear, that theſe Poems were compoſed about the
Time that the antient Bards of <hi>Iceland,</hi> and the other northern
Countries, made ſo great a Figure in Poetry; or, perhaps, their Date may
reach back beyond the Time of Chriſtianity being preached in our Iſlands;
hence it will follow, that our Anceſtors were riſing by ſurpriſing
Efforts to catch the faireſt Flowers of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus,</hi> while the
polite Regions of <hi>Europe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded <pb n="169" facs="tcp:1173200202:178"/> with
polemic Theology and monkiſh Nonſenſe: this becomes the more probable,
when we reflect, that ſcarce any Trace of Chriſtianity is to be found in
theſe Pieces, and no Trace of the Names that prevailed after the ninth
Century, inſtead of which, the Names appear entirely Pagan; and numberleſs
Hints are taken from the predatory Life our Anceſtors (particularly thoſe
of the Iſlands and north-weſt Coaſts of <hi>Scotland)</hi> led before,
and at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel among them. A critical Examination
of the original Language would help to throw ſome Light on this Conjecture,
as well as the Publication of Pieces of greater Length, which may follow
theſe firſt Specimens. It is not, however, to be doubted, that the many
Fragments ſtill preſerved amongſt our Highlanders of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Poetry, may be of great Uſe in ſettling the Hiſtory, and aſcertaining
the Meaning of ſeveral Antiquities diſperſed over the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous Parts
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> while the Man of Taſte muſt be agreeably
ſurpriſed to find a Beauty and Force of Diction, a Warmth of Fancy, a
chaſte and truly noble Simplicy united, where hitherto no Perſon has ever
looked for it. <pb n="170" facs="tcp:1173200202:179"/> If theſe Specimens are well received by
the Public, and if ſuitable Encouragement were given to the ingenious
Tranſlator, he would oblige the World with the Tranſlation of the Epic Poem
mentioned in the Preface, which conſiſts of upwards of nine thouſand
Lines: but the dependant Situation of a Tutor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afford him Leiſure to
undertake ſo great a Work.</p>
            <p>Your Friends in this Corner of the World were much diſappointed,
in not having the Happineſs of ſeeing you laſt Summer along with Lord
LYTTELTON; and without Flattery I can aſſure, that the Number of your
Friends in <hi>Scotland</hi> is greater than, perhaps, you think of, and every
one of them would be happy to have an Opportunity of ſeeing and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
you. Lord ALEMOOR, Dr. ROEBUCK and his Spouſe deſire to be remembered; and
I ſhall take it as a particular Favour, that you would, at a leiſure Hour,
write me your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the incloſed Specimens, and allow me to be with
Eſteem, truly, dear Sir,</p>

            <p>I KNOW no Way ſo good of making up for my long Silence to you, as
ſending you the encloſed Poem, which if it gives you as much Pleaſure as
it did me, you will give me no ſmall Thanks for: it is tranſlated from an
old Highland Poem, by one Mr. M' PHER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON, a Miniſter in the Highlands. There
are great Numbers of theſe Elegies all over the Highlands, which they ſing
to mournful Tunes in the Evening over their Fires. Mr. M' PHER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON has, I hear,
tranſlated ten more of them, which I fancy will ſoon be publiſhed; if
they are not, I ſhall endeavour to get them, and ſend them to you. It will
be needleſs to ſay <pb n="172" facs="tcp:1173200202:181"/> any Thing in Praiſe of the
Poem, as I think it can ſufficiently recommend itſelf. The Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
has a great deal of Merit; I think it is one of the beſt I ever ſaw. I
fancy SHEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STONE will be much pleaſed with the Poem, which I ſhall be
obliged to you if you will preſent to him with my Compliments.</p>

rooting up the Poſts, the paving and lighting of <hi>Oxford-Road, Holborn,
Monmouth-Street,</hi> and <hi>St. Giles</hi>'s, the conſtructing of
<hi>Black-Friars-Bridge, &amp;c.</hi> that I cannot recollect any other Remark
I made worth mentioning, at preſent, except the introducing of Aſſes in
the City, for the Uſe of Milkmen, Fruiterers, Hawkers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:1173200202:193"/>This I thought a great Improvement, as it
ſerves to leſſen the Number of Barrows that uſed to interrupt Walkers
on the broad Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but this Conſideration was damped again at ſeeing
the barbarous Treatment theſe poor Animals often ſuffer from their brutal
Guides or Riders. I often thought of STERNE upon theſe Occaſions.<note n="*" place="bottom">See a Paſſage about an Aſs in his <hi>Sentimental
Journey.</hi>
               </note> An Aſs is a dull, ſlow Creature, that will not mend
its Pace for Whip or Spur—This theſe Wretches call
<hi>Obſtinacy,</hi> and ſo puniſh it for a Defect of Nature, as they
would for a moral Vice: for if they reaſon at all, you may be ſure they
reaſon thus, becauſe it is wrong.</p>
            <p>This has renewed a Reflection in my Mind, that has often occurred to
me before, upon the unaccountable Diſpoſition towards Cruelty exerciſed
againſt the Brute-Creation, which is too frequently obſerved among the
general Claſſes of Mankind, who have not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by natural
Sentiment, or refined by a liberal Education.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:1173200202:194"/>If Sympathy, as modern Philoſophers
aſſert, be the ultimate Cauſe of our being affected for others, that of
Pain, one would think, ſhould be the ſtrongeſt. All Men do not feel
Misfortunes, or ſuffer Grief, alike. One Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may reſent a
Mortification, or a Loſs, to Madneſs; while his more temperate Friend can
afford his Pity or Compaſſion no higher or further than his own
Paſſions or Sentiments would have extended in the ſame Circumſtances.
Here Sympathy is at an End. But all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Animals too are alike
ſenſible of Pain—<hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
            <p>We have from hence Reaſon to conclude, that 'tis more from Want of
Thought, than of Humanity, that the contrary is ſo apparent; and this
Argument, I think, is fully proved by the Obſervation, that Children and
Fools are the moſt guilty of it.</p>
            <p>Beſides which, there is a great deal in Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, that may take
off from the natural Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Compaſſion, with Regard to the
Brute-Creation, among Numbers of People, ſuch as <pb n="186" facs="tcp:1173200202:195"/>
Butchers, Surgeons, Soldiers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman being reprehended
for the Barbarity of fleaing Eels alive, anſwered, that it was no Cruelty,
<hi>as they were ſo much uſed to it</hi>; which was plainly transferring
the Inſenſibility ſhe had herſelf acquired, through Habit, to the poor
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Reptile. This puts me in Mind of the Blunder of an
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Parliament once, that framed an Act to puniſh Forgery with
the Loſs of both Ears, and ſo <hi>toties quoties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is alſo, I apprehend, a Sort of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſting in
uninſtructed Minds, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality has nothing to do with our Actions
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Brutes, any more than it has with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to inanimate Nature; ſo
that many Folks, from ſuch a ſtrange Miſconception, torture an Animal
with as little Remorſe as they would lop off the Branch of a Tree. Such
People muſt never have read the Sentence of SOLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON, that <hi>a good Man is
merciful to his Beaſt</hi>; nor that of SHAKESPEARE, 
<q> 
                  <l>"The poor Beetle that we tread upon,</l> 
                  <l>"In corp'ral Suff'rance feels a Pang as great</l> 
                  <l>"As when a Giant dies."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:1173200202:196"/>I remember I was once ſitting with a Friend,
and ſeeing his Son tormenting a poor Dog, by making him ſuffer great Pain,
I ſpake to the Father, to reprove him for it; to which he coolly anſwered,
that as he deſigned the Boy for the Army, he did not care to inſpire him
with too tender Feelings. 
<q rend="inline">"Your Idea might not be much amiſs,"</q> I
replied, 
<q rend="inline">"if you meant to breed him a Butcher, or a
Hangman."</q> What a Gothic Notion, that Bravery and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity were
incompatible!</p>
            <p>OVID ſeems to have been of my Opinion in the above Reproof, by
making Prieſts, who were the firſt Butchers, or Sacrificers, to have led
the Way to Cruelty and Slaughter—
<q> 
                  <l>Primoque a caede Ferarum</l> 
                  <l>Incaluiſſe putem maculatum ſanguine Ferrum.</l>
               </q> I will
not ſay, however, that this may be the Reaſon why Parſons and Butchers
are equally excluded from being on Juries of Life and Death, becauſe there
would be a Sort of <hi>pert Dulneſs</hi> in the Remark—Aſking Pardon
for the <pb n="188" facs="tcp:1173200202:197"/> Tautology—No; the true Reaſon for
theſe Excluſions is, that the latter are rendered cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, from being too
familiar with Slaughter; and with Regard to the former, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Peace ſhould keep clear of Blood.</p>
            <p>A Thought has juſt occurred to me. I have not Leiſure both to
examine and to write it too, ſo I ſhall only ſport it for the preſent.
Perhaps, the Injunction in the Levitical Law, to abſtain from Blood, might
not have been meant in Derogation of <hi>Black-Puddings</hi> in the leaſt,
but only as a figurative Manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the Sixth Commandment, 
<q rend="inline">"Thou ſhalt do no Murder."</q>
            </p>
            <p>A Comment upon the Inhibition of PYTHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GORAS, <hi>Abſtine à
Fabis,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Abſtain from Beans.</note> has hinted
this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to me; for the learned BACON, which Name, you know, accords very
well with <hi>Beans,</hi> ſays, that what the Sage intended by the
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition was, to forbid meddling with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and Strife of
Electioneering, where the Votes or Suffrages were given, <hi>pro</hi> and

            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:1173200202:198"/>And this Interpretation ought certainly to
appear the true Senſe of the Precept, from this Conſideration; for as that
Philoſopher had before reſtricted his Diſciples from the Uſe of all
animal Food, on Account of the tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratory Notions he had picked up in
<hi>India,</hi> he could not poſſibly have been ſo unconſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as
to have laid any Manner of Reſtraint on the vegetable Product of the
Earth.</p>

            <p>THE great Reſpect you, Sir, have ſhewn to Mr. SHENSTONE, in
dedicating your Tragedy of ROSAMOND to his Memory, added to the Pleaſure I
have received from ſome of your other Publications, will, I truſt, plead an
Excuſe for an Intruſion from a Stranger, and eſpecially as it is to beg
your Acceptance of the encloſed Poem; it was written by that Friend whoſe
Death you ſo feelingly lament; it has been in my Poſſeſſion ever
ſince, or before that Period: of its Merits I am no Judge; but from its
Author, ſhould imagine it not deſtitute, and have long regretted its
remaining in Hands ſo little capable of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it appear as it ought. The
ſincere Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I received, in ſeeing Mr. SHENSTONE's Name ſo
reſpectfully and publickly revived, induced me to wiſh to make the Author
ſome Acknowledgment, and this appears to be the <pb n="191" facs="tcp:1173200202:200"/> only
Way; for ſhould not the <hi>Diamond</hi> have Brilliancy enough for the
Public, yet it may not be an unwelcome Amuſement to a private Friend, to
remove the Dimneſs.</p>
            <p>I ſhould much ſooner have made this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, but from a
Diffidence of its being accepted; however, I hope the beſt, and that you will
be kind enough to accept it as it is meant. Should it prove worthy of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
and acceptable to ſo partial a Friend, I ſhall hope, (as I have no Copy) to
receive your Opinion; and muſt requeſt it as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Favour, that to
any Friend you chuſe to ſhew it, my Name may not be mentioned; on that
Account I decline ſaying any Thing of myſelf. My Addreſs is,

more capable of introducing it proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the public Inſpection; ſuch I
imagine is your Intention, and I moſt willingly receive the Favour you offer,
of letting me know your Determination; for why may I not look upon the Friend
of a Gentleman, whoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory I eſteem, in the Number of my own? Give me

               <p>P. S. I thank you for the two Inſcriptions to the Memory of our
amiable Friend. They would have been agreeable Companions to ſome of the
ſame Turn already printed at the End of his Works, by Mr. DODSLEY. That which
was wrote by CUNNINGHAM is poſſeſſed of genuine Elegance and
Senſibility. I dare ſay you think ſo. Thoſe you have ſent, affect me
in the ſame Manner; particularly the <hi>Proſe</hi>-Tribute, which you tell
me came from a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Pen. I think I can gueſs the Writer, and would, when
next I ſee her, challenge a Confeſſion, were I ſure I could do it
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wounding her Delicacy of Feeling.</p>
               <p>The Elegy I alſo admire much. The Thoughts of the Author are
equally tender and benevolent with thoſe of the Friend, whoſe Memory he
ſo pathetically laments. The laſt Lines of the ſecond Stanza particularly
pleaſe me.</p>

            <head>LETTER LVI. R. G—, Eſq. to Mr. HULL.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Received your Letter, and it has aſtoniſhed me, that you can
be in the leaſt Degree hurt by the Opinion of narrow Minds. With Regard to
the Grievance you complain of; let it be always a Matter of Conſolation to
you, that the illiberal Treatment Actors may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meet with, on Account
of their Profeſſion, can never proceed from any but illiberal Minds; 'tis
the Cenſurers themſelves who become Objects of Contempt, when they would
render you ſo, <hi>from that Conſideration merely:</hi> and this
Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought therefore to make you as indifferent to ſuch Inſtances of
Ignorance and Ill-breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <pb n="219" facs="tcp:1173200202:226"/> as you would be to a
<hi>Billingſgate</hi> Scold, or a St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Abuſe.</p>
            <p>An Actor is a reſpectable Character, while he properly
conſiders, and endeavours to preſerve the original Deſign of his
Profeſſion; and I have ever been of Opinion, and am convinced of the Truth
of the Maxim, that acting ſhould unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably be accepted among the
Liberal Arts, even with this Advantage over Poetry and Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that it
ſuperadds Example to Document and Delight. 'Tis the <hi>living Moral,</hi>
while the others are but the <hi>dead Letter.</hi> The Stage is a School, and
may be an uſeful one too—As ſuch it was patronized and cheriſhed by
the wiſeſt and moſt virtuous States of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi>;
and it has been the Fault of Managers, not of Actors, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Theatres have
ceaſed to afford either Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or Example.</p>
            <p>There are ſo many Requiſites of Talents, Aſſiduity, and
Perſon, to form a complete Actor, that even a moderate Degree of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
ſhould be deemed ſufficient Merit to entitle a Performer to the public
Favour and Indulgence: to which, if an honeſt, decent <pb n="220" facs="tcp:1173200202:227"/>
and unexceptionable Repute be joined, I can ſee no Sort of Reaſon, in the
Nature or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Things, why the <hi>Sock and Buſkin</hi> ſhould
not be admitted <hi>ad eundem</hi> with the <hi>Goif and Cowl</hi>; ſo that
it muſt be the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal</hi> Character, and not the <hi>Dramatis
Perſonae,</hi> that can ever debaſe your Profeſſion; in which
Predicament, both the Parſon and the Lawyer ſtand equally with you.</p>
            <p>But, indeed, the World, that illiberal Part of it which you hint at,
are apt to conſider us Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, alſo, in the ſame inferior Light they do
Actors. I remember a Friend of mine, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ago, was caſt off by his
Father, for having publiſhed a very ingenious Poem, while he was a Student at
the Temple; and another Acquaintance was ſeverely reproved by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
for having married a Lady, every other Way worthy of his Choice, <hi>becauſe
ſhe had written a Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such curious Cenſors, I ſuppoſe, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the
Meanneſs of my Spirit now, if I ſhould declare to them, that I would rather
have been HOMER or VIRGIL, than ALEX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANDER <pb n="221" facs="tcp:1173200202:228"/> or AUGUSTUS;
and ROSCIUS the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, than the Tribune of the ſame Name; though the latter
was a Sort of Manager, as may be proved by his having framed the <hi>Lex
Roſcia,</hi> for the Regulation of the Theatre at <hi>Rome.</hi> But it might
poſſibly reconcile them to me again, if I ſhould confeſs this common
Foible of human Nature, at the ſame Time, that fond as I am of Fame, I would
yet rather be even what I am myſelf <hi>now,</hi> than the beſt of them all
<hi>then.</hi> This is ſome Sort of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification to the former
Sentiment.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here conclude my Letter to you, with intreating, that you
will continue to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the Malice of ſuch ignorant Cenſors, by an uniform
Attention to the Spirit and Utility of that <hi>Walk</hi> in Life, which either
Fortune, or your own Choice, has led you into. Elevate your Creſt; take

accordingly begin my Taſk, and am very happy to have an Opportunity of
writing to you a good long Letter, without the Expence of Poſtage, which I
have not the Vanity to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my Epiſtles deſerve; I ſend this by a
pretty Sort of Man, whoſe Name is —, and who, I ſhould ſuppoſe,
has ſome ſtrong Attachment in your County, which induces him to take ſo
long a Journey at this rude Seaſon of the Year.</p>
            <p>We were very fortunate in Weather, and found the Roads as good as
the Nature of the <pb n="224" facs="tcp:1173200202:231"/> Country will allow them to be. Some
Parts of <hi>Savoy</hi> is frightfully wild and dreary, other Parts very
romantic and beautiful. I was vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amuſed with the Manner of
croſſing Mount <hi>Cenis:</hi> the Chair we are carried in, or rather
<hi>on,</hi> reſemble a good deal a <hi>Chineſe</hi> Palanquin, only they
want a Canopy over them; the Chairmen are certainly the beſt in the World, or
it would be both dangerous and frightful; it ſeems to me, that they have the
Strength of Mules, and the Agility of Goats, for they run down the Precipices,
and bound from Rock to Rock, in a moſt aſtoniſhing Manner. The Aſcent
of the Mountain is three Miles, on the Side of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Plain on the
Top, ſix Miles in Length, and the Deſcent on the <hi>Turin</hi> Side, ſix
Miles more; we had four Men to each of the Ladies' Chairs, and ſix to the
Gentlemen's, and after carrying us theſe fifteen dreadful Miles, they were
quite delighted that our Party took them on from <hi>Novaleſe</hi> (a ſmall
Town at the Foot of Mount <hi>Cenis)</hi> to <hi>Suſa,</hi> which is nine
Miles further, and they carried us the laſt three Leagues in an Hour and a
Half, laughing and jeſting with each other all the Way, as if they had been
doing a Thing <pb n="225" facs="tcp:1173200202:232"/> merely for Sport and Amuſement; ſo you
ſee, my dear Sir, how viſible the Goodneſs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is to all
Creatures; theſe poor Souls, who ſpend all their Lives in the utmoſt
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence, and inhabit a Country that ſeems only fit for Savages, if they
are denied the Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Life, are amply repaid, in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a
double Portion of Health and Strength.</p>
            <p>We ſtopped a few Days at <hi>Lyons, Turin, Milan</hi> and
<hi>Verona,</hi> and ſaw every Thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a Stranger's Curioſity, in
each of theſe fine Cities; nothing amuſed me more, than ſeeing a Parcel
of <hi>Angels</hi> walking about the Streets of <hi>Milan,</hi> they were fine
Cherry-cheek'd Boys, ready dreſſed for a grand Proceſſion that was
preparing for the Day following, in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi>'s
Birth-Day. <hi>Venice</hi> is a very magnificent Place, and poſſeſſes
the Charm of Novelty in a much higher Degree than any of the other Places I
have named; 'tis impoſſible to give a ſtronger Idea of it, 'tis in a
Stile ſo peculiar to itſelf. The Maſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is begun, which is extremely
entertaining: I ſhould be exceſſively happy to pop in amongſt 
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1173200202:233"/> your dear Society ſome Day, when you are all
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled; I aſſure you, it would be no ſmall Surprize to ſee me
in a <hi>Venetian</hi> Dreſs; it conſiſts of a long black ſilk Cloak,
called here a <hi>Tabora,</hi> a <hi>Baouta,</hi> which is made of black Lace,
three Quarters of a Yard long, and five Times as wide, and hangs about the
Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders like a Petticoat; it has a Hood to it, which, when you chooſe to
be concealed, covers the bottom Part of the Face to the upper Lip, the reſt
is hid by a white Maſk, and the Women wear on their Heads a Man's Hat
ſmartly cocked; the <hi>Venetian</hi> Women, who are rather maſculine in
their Manner, look ſtill more ſo in this Dreſs.</p>
            <p>We have had the Prince of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> here for ten Days,
which made the Town all alive. I will deſcribe to you one of the
Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made for him, and that will ſerve as a Specimen of all the
Reſt. Our Reſident had not got then into his Palace, (as it is juſtly
called, for it is indeed a noble one) ſo that he could not make any
Entertainments for the Prince, but he gave him ſome excellent Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic one
Morning in a private Manner, which <pb n="227" facs="tcp:1173200202:234" rendition="simple:additions"/> he ſeemed to
enjoy the more for being ſo. The Night after his Highneſs's Arrival, Count
DURAZZO, the Imperial Ambaſſador, invited all the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the
foreign Nobility that don't belong to <hi>Venice,</hi> and all the foreign
Miniſters, to meet the Prince at Supper. The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs received her
Gueſts with mingled Grace and Dignity, ſhe is really a fine Woman, and her
Beauty was heightened by all the Elegance of Dreſs; ſoon after the Company
were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, a moſt delightful Serenade began upon the Water, which
was not only delightful to the Ear, but formed a very beautiful Object to the
Sight, for the Muſicians were placed in a large open Barge finely
illuminated; the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony drew around them an infinite Number of Gondolas
belonging to the noble Venetians, who could no otherwiſe partake of this
Feaſt; for by their Laws they are ſecluded from all Commerce with Strangers
that are in a public Character. At proper Intervals of the Muſic, all Sorts
of Refreſhments, of Ices, Fruits, Sweat-meats, Lemonades, <hi>&amp;c.
&amp;c.</hi> were preſented to the Company, who, when they had liſtened to
the Serenade for ſome Time, changed the Scene, either ſat down to Cards, or
formed little chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <pb n="228" facs="tcp:1173200202:235"/> Parties. When the Card-Tables
broke up, a very elegant Concert, compoſed of a few choice Pieces of Muſic,
performed by the very beſt Hands, agreeably filled up Time, till a moſt
magnificent Supper was ſerved. When the Company roſe from Table, Coffee was
brought, which is the Cuſtom here after Supper, as well as after Dinner; when
this was over, a ſuperb Barge attended, in which the Prince, and all the
Ladies, and a ſuitable Number of Gentlemen were placed, and rowed to St.
<hi>Mark's</hi> (which is the only public Place here for walking) followed by
the Muſic, the reſt of the Company in their Gondolas, and thoſe of the
noble <hi>Venetians</hi> which the Harmony had attracted. After walking for
ſome Time to enjoy the cool Air, the Company retired to a very elegant
Apartment, which the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadreſs has on the Place of St. <hi>Mark,</hi>
where ſhe receives her Company, when ſhe chuſes to be in private. When we
had chatted here for Half an Hour, it was found to be a proper Time to retire,
as it was three o'Clock in the Morning; and ſo ended this agreeable Even,
every Part of which was employed in ſome innocent Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without any
Thing being hurried or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. <pb n="229" facs="tcp:1173200202:236"/> I have been the more
particular in this Account, that you may ſee, my good Friend, that Taſte
and Elegance is no more wanting in <hi>Venice,</hi> than it is in the gay
Metropolis of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope you will ſoon indulge me with a Letter, and that it will
bring me a good Account of yourſelf, and every worthy Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual of our
Friends in Friendſhip aſſembled; ſend it in a Frank to Mr. L—, in
— Street, <hi>London,</hi> and he will put it in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency's
Packet: it muſt be but a ſingle Letter, but I hope it will contain a good
deal. I long to hear that your good Mother is well re-eſtabliſhed in her
Health, ſhe is a worthy Soul, and one cannot help wiſhing ſuch People to
live for ever; I hope, my dear Friend, though ſuch a cruel Diſtance divides
us, that I am not eſteemed the leſs a Member of the friendly Society, than
if I was with you; I find the ſame Warmth of Affection towards the happy
Circle, as if I was not an <hi>Abſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,</hi> therefore beg you will give my
beſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to all the happy Members.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:1173200202:237"/>I went the other Day to ſee the Ceremony of
a Nun taking the laſt Veil, and 'tis very awful and melancholy, and, to
ſpeak honeſtly and unprudiſhly, does not inſpire me with the leaſt
Deſire to be a Nun: firſt, the divine Service is performed with very fine
Muſic, both vocal and inſtrumental, in the Church of the Convent; then a
little Door is opened in the Grate of the private Chapel, before which the Nun
is ſeated on a Chair of State under a Canopy, with a Prayer-Book in her Hand,
till the Service is finiſhed; ſhe then comes forward, and kneeling at the
Grate, repeats to a Prieſt the Vows of the Order, and promiſes Obedience to
the Abbeſs; ſhe then riſes, and the Nuns take off her white Veil, and put
on a black one, after which ſhe kneels and ſays ſome Prayers: then ſix
of the Siſters advance, and hold over her a purple Pall, whilſt Part of the
Funeral-Service is read, during which Time ſhe is ſuppoſed to be
<hi>dead</hi>; they then take away the purple Cloth, and the Abbeſs places on
her Head a Crown richly ornamented with Jewels, to ſignify that ſhe dies to
the World and riſes again to Glory; ſhe then receives <pb n="231" facs="tcp:1173200202:238"/> from the Prieſt a Tablet, with the Rules of the Order, which ſhe
reads over and kiſſes; then, with the Tablet in one Hand, and a long wax
Taper, ornamented with Wreaths of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in the other, ſhe walks ſlowly
round the Chapel, followed by the reſt of the Nuns, and depoſits the Tablet
on the Altar. Thus ends the melancholy Ceremony. This young Lady was very
pretty, and not above ſeventeen; we all thought ſhe had an Appearance of
great Conſtraint in her Chearfulneſs, but we were aſſured, it was
entirely her Choice, that ſhe had a large Fortune, had buried her Father, and
was Miſtreſs of herſelf; perhaps it may be the Taſte of the Family, for
another Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter profeſſed laſt Year in the ſame Convent.</p>
            <p>As we are but juſt got to our new Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, you will eaſily
ſuppoſe nobody is idle the Houſe, however I was determined I would not
loſe ſo fair an Opportunity of writing to you, ſo hope you will excuſe
ſo vile a Scrawl, and believe me, when I aſſure you, there is nothing
more true, than that I am, my good Sir, ever moſt ſincerely and
affectionately yours and the Society's,</p>

            <p>MAY every Bleſſing of this chearful Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon await you, and
every Individual of the happy Family and Friends you are with! May your
Pleaſures be unmixed with Pain, and your Years numerous and
happy!—Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe fervent Wiſhes of an exiled Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of your
worthy Society, and be aſſured, that though you are all Abſent from my
Sight, you are ever preſent to my Mind. I wrote you a long Letter, near three
Months ago, by an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentleman, who aſſured me, he ſhould
be in your Part of the World as ſoon as the Poſt; when lo, and behold!
three Weeks ago I heard of him at <hi>Sienna,</hi> where, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he
will ſtay the Winter; therefore, as I am quite in the Dark, in Regard to the
Fate of my unfortunate Epiſtle, I could not be eaſy till I had again ſet
Pen to Paper, <pb n="233" facs="tcp:1173200202:240"/> to requeſt you will all continue to love
me as I do you, which I aſſure you, my dear Sir, is with undiminiſhed
Truth. I believe I told you in my laſt, how to forward a Letter to me, but
for fear you have never received it, I will repeat it; if you can ſend it to
any Friend in <hi>London,</hi> and get them to forward it by the Penny Poſt
to Mr. L—, in — Street, he will encloſe it in the Secretary of
State's Packet, by which Means, I ſhall be more certain of getting it ſafe,
than by the Poſt, as well as that I ſhall receive it free.</p>
            <p>I have a great Favour, my dear Sir, to beg of you, which is, that
you will procure me a Piece of Information for the Uſe of our Reſident, in
Regard to a young Gentleman who has been at <hi>Venice</hi> for ſome Time,
and ſeems in no Hurry to leave it, owing, as we imagine, to an Attachment to
a fair <hi>Venetian</hi> Lady; his Name is —, his Family, he ſays, is
ſettled near <hi>F—</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi>; he makes a
genteel Appearance in Point of Fortune, and ſeems to be a modeſt, pretty
behaved young Man, upon which Account, his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency wiſhes to ſhew him
any Civility in his <pb n="234" facs="tcp:1173200202:241"/> Power; but, at the ſame Time,
would be glad to be rightly informed, as to his Character and Family, before he
receives him in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Manner. I thought it was very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, Mr.
D— might know his Father. I have ſome Notion, I have heard the Name
mentioned at Mr. B—'s; if, my dear Sir, you can procure me a particular
Account of this young Hero, I ſhall eſteem it as a great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>I am become wonderfully fond of the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quing Dreſs, and am
told, I wear it juſt as well as a <hi>Venetian</hi>; 'tis the moſt
comfortable, warm, Walking-Dreſs that can be conceived; I have kept Houſe
theſe laſt nine Days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was prohibited, but to-morrow
Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quing begins again, and continues till Lent. I am told we had an
Earthquake, but, thank God, I did not perceive it: ſince that, there had been
very tempeſtuous Weather, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Snow and Rain, which, added to a high
Tide, overflowed all the Canals, and I can't but ſay, at that Time
<hi>Venice</hi> gave me a ſtrong Idea of the univerſal Deluge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:1173200202:242"/>There have been five Theatres open till within
theſe nine Days, and I am told, in the Carnival there will be no leſs than
ſeven. The comic Opera was very pleaſing, in Point of Muſic, and always
crouded; but the ſerious Opera nobody could bear, though MANZOLI ſung in
it, and TIBALDI, who is reckoned one of the beſt tenor Voices, if not the
very beſt, now living. By this you will perceive how the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
and <hi>Italian</hi> Taſte for Muſic differs; though I muſt ſay, I
believe the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Admirers of MANZOLI would allow he is much altered for
the worſe; for my own Part, had I not remembered his Perſon, I ſhould not
have had the leaſt Recollection of him from his Voice. The Theatre, he
performed at, was entirely fitted up with Glaſs, both the Stage and all the
Boxes, which, when well lighted, had a fine Effect. There was a Change of the
Scenes for one of the Dances, that was, I think one of the moſt beautiful
Things I ever beheld.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> Comedy does not delight me much, for I do not
underſtand the Language <pb n="236" facs="tcp:1173200202:243"/> well enough yet, to be
amuſed with the <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mots</hi> of HARLEQUIN, and to laugh at him becauſe
he has a black Face, and at PAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TALOON, merely for having a long Beard; it is
not what I feel myſelf much diſpoſed to do. I underſtand the
<hi>Italian</hi> Tragedies better than the Comedies, but I find the Actors
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely below ours. I intend to be very ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and when all the
Family are gadding to the Opera and the Play, I ſhall ſit at home and
drudge at the <hi>Italian,</hi> and this for many good Reaſons, but chiefly
to acquit my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of my chief Promiſe to you.</p>
            <p>We have, at preſent, a ſecond Edition of the Prince of
<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> who has been at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> a Week, but on
<hi>Monday</hi> next he leaves us entirely. This Time he has ſpent moſt of
his leiſure Hours with our Reſident, and expreſſes great Pleaſure in
being received on an intimate and eaſy Footing; he is really a very
ſenſible and agreeable Man, and as far as can be judged from outward
Appearance, is very amiable: he has with him two young <hi>German</hi> Barons,
who are alſo very pretty Kind <pb n="237" facs="tcp:1173200202:244"/> of Men, and ſpeak
<hi>Engliſh</hi> ſo well, that it is a Comfort to hear them.</p>
            <p>My Brother deſires me to preſent his beſt Reſpects to you,
and I hope my dear nominal Uncle will always be mindful to ſay for me to the
dear Society every Thing that is kind, grateful, and affectionate.</p>
            <p>My Vanity will not ſuffer me to paſs over in Silence a
Conqueſt that I am told I have certainly made, of an <hi>Italian</hi> Count,
who is here in a public Character; he is not quite ſixty, his Figure and
Complexion exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles a very bad, long, thin Tallow-Candle; he is
much bedaubed with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Snuff, and on meagre Days ſo overcomes
one with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that it is dreadful; except theſe little Accidents, he is
a moſt agreeable Companion, for he is very ſenſible, very religious, very
philoſophic, extremely polite, and his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is both inſtructive
and amuſing. Now, my good Friend, from the Picture I have drawn, would you
not think I was in ſome Danger of loſing my Heart, but that luckily 
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1173200202:245"/> my amiable Count is a bigotted Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic, and I an
obſtinate <hi>Heretick?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may give ourſelves what Airs we pleaſe about our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberty, but for the <hi>Ladies, Italy</hi> is undoubtedly
the Land of perfect Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; to all public Places, they conſtantly go in
Pairs, with their <hi>Cavalier Serventes,</hi> and put me much in Mind of the
<hi>clean</hi> and <hi>unclean</hi> Beaſts going into the Ark. What would
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the Reputation of a miſerable <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman, if ſhe
was to go to the Play with a Man <hi>tête-à-tête?</hi> And
yet that is conſtantly done here without Imputation of Wrong—In
ſhort, if a Woman has any Mind to be wicked, <hi>Venice</hi> ſeems to be
the laſt Place in the World to give her better Sentiments.</p>
            <p>How delighted ſhould I be to ſurprize the dear Society, ſome
Night or other, when you are over your ſober Game of Quadrille, in my white
Maſque and Man's Hat; you have no Notion with what an Air I have learnt to
put it over my right Eye. I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair but that we may again meet
happily under that hoſpitable Roof, where for ſome <pb n="239" facs="tcp:1173200202:246"/>
Weeks, in the Enjoyment of ſuch friendly Converſation, I taſted more real
Happineſs and Peace than I ever experienced <hi>before</hi> or
<hi>ſince</hi> in my whole Life. I did not know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had the melancholy
Experience of it, how very irkſome and painful a Feel it is, to be ſo very
far from thoſe we truly regard. Adieu! my dear Friends, may Heaven ſhower
upon you all its choiceſt Bleſſings, is the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and conſtant
Prayer of your ever faithful and affectionate</p>

of my Promiſe with Courage; well knowing, from the Candour of your

gratify your laudable Curioſity, in Lieu of greater Abilities for ſuch an
Undertaking.</p>
            <p>I am not ſurpriſed, that a Perſon of your ſpeculative Turn
ſhould feel an earneſt Deſire to be made acquainted with ſome
Particulars relative to the wiſe and complicated Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Republic
of <hi>Venice</hi>; it juſtly merits the Attention of the ſenſible and
curious Part of Mankind, were it only to diſcover by what Means it has been
preſerved nearly in the ſame State, for ſuch a Number of Ages; but it is
hardly poſſible to arrive with Certainty at this Knowledge; for there is no
Subject the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> are ſo tenacious of converſing upon as
Politicks, profound Secrecy being the great Engine on which this very
ſingular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment turns. I find <hi>one muſt</hi> not depend too much on
the Accounts of thoſe who have written upon the Subject, for after allowing 
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:1173200202:248"/> the utmoſt to their Integrity and Induſtry, they
muſt have been often liable to Miſinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, beſides the unavoidable
Change that Time naturally produces in all ſublunary Things. I have now lying
before me a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Republic, by AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAI, one by ST.
DISDIER, and another by the ABBÉE LANGIER, of a much later Date; and I
ſhall freely tranſcribe from theſe Authors, in as ſuccinct a Manner as
poſſible, all ſuch Paſſages as coincide with the preſent State of
Things: but the moſt pleaſing Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant I promiſe myſelf is, Mr.
SMITH, who has been ſettled in this City a great Number of Years, and was
formerly the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul; he is now retired from Buſineſs,
and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votes his Time to the Study and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the polite Arts, of
which he is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Protector; he is, at preſent, appointed
<hi>Chargé d'Affaires,</hi> by our Court, till the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of Sir JAMES
WRIGHT, who ſucceeds the preſent Ambaſſador at
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the Reſidentſhip of <hi>Venice.</hi> I am
ſorry the new Miniſter is not expected during my Stay here, for, as I am
told, he has ſpent ſome Time in this Capital, when upon his Travels in a
pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <pb n="242" facs="tcp:1173200202:249"/> Character. Under his Auſpices, I might,
perhaps, with more Eaſe, have purſued my Reſearches. Mr. SMITH is an
intelligent, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Man, and preſerves, in a very advanced Age, a
Degree of Politeneſs, Vivacity and Good-Humour, rarely to be met with, which
renders his Converſation as pleaſing as it is inſtructive. This Gentleman
is married to the Siſter of Mr. MURRAY, the late Reſident, a very amiable
Woman; their Houſe is open every Evening to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in the
moſt eaſy, agreeable Manner, where I have infinite Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in talking

prophane my favourite Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, by introducing it with the dry one, your
Curioſity has led me to.</p>
            <p>As ST. DISDIER is my favourite Writer on the State of
<hi>Venice,</hi> I ſhall begin with his Account of the Origin of this City,
but muſt firſt endeavour to make you acquainted with the <hi>Lagunes,</hi>
(or Lakes) which I look upon to be the great Sources of Health and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as well as the Means <pb n="243" facs="tcp:1173200202:250"/> by which
all their Wants are ſupplied; nothing can be more delicious, than the Airings
the Nobility take on theſe Lakes during the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Seaſon, ſometimes
attended with a Barge filled with Muſicians, and often
<hi>tête-à-tête</hi> with their <hi>Ciciſbeo,</hi> in a
Gondola, which is an eaſy and luxurious Conveyance. The <hi>Lagunes</hi> are
formed by a ſtrong Bank of Sand, at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Gulph, which extends
from South to Weſt about thirty-ſix Miles, and is about ſix Hundred Feet
in Breadth; the Sea, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving broke through the Bank in ſix different Places,
has covered with Water all the low Land for ſeven or eight Miles, leaving a
Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſmall Iſlands, upon which are built the Towns of the
<hi>Lagunes.</hi> The ſix Paſſages above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, are the only Ports by
which Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels can approach to <hi>Venice.</hi> Firſt, that of
<hi>Brondolo,</hi> to the South; ſecondly, <hi>Chioſa,</hi> (an epiſcopal
City;) thirdly, <hi>Malamocco</hi>; fourthly, <hi>Lido,</hi> (oppoſite to the
Eaſt Point of <hi>Venice;)</hi> fifthly, <hi>St. Eraſmus,</hi> and
ſixthly, the three Ports; by this laſt, only the ſmall fiſhing Barks
can paſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:1173200202:251"/>In the Year 407, the <hi>Goths,</hi> under the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of RADAGAISUS, having broke like a Torrent into <hi>Italy,</hi> put
all the Inhabitants to the Sword, who attempted to oppoſe their Fury; the
People who were ſituated near the <hi>Lagunes</hi> (I have above deſcribed)
found no Aſylum ſo ſecure as thoſe maritime Iſles, the moſt Part of
which were only inhabited by Fiſhermen: here the Fugitives remained in
Safety, until the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, ſent by the Emperor HONORIUS, (having defeated
the Barbarians) left the affrighted Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers at Liberty to return to the
<hi>Terra Firma.</hi> In the Year 413, the horrible Ravages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the
<hi>Viſigoths,</hi> under ALARICK, made the ſame People a ſecond Time
ſeek their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Retreat; and as theſe Invaders ſtaid longer in
<hi>Italy</hi> than thoſe led by RADAGAISUS, the Fugitives began to build
themſelves comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Habitations on theſe Iſlands. The
<hi>Paduans,</hi> to whom theſe Iſles belonged, had a Port at that of
<hi>Rialto,</hi> (now called <hi>Venice)</hi> and the Senate having reſolved
to make it a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Place, not only by Way of Aſylum for their
Subjects, but alſo to ſecure their Trade by Sea, ſent, in the Year 441,
three Conſuls, who proclaimed it a free Port, ſo that in a 
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1173200202:252"/> ſhort Time it was peopled, not only by thoſe who
retired to the Iſlands for Safety, but by many Perſons of all Ranks, who
left the <hi>Terra Firma</hi> to ſettle there. The third Undertaking of the
Barbarians, under ATTILA, King of the <hi>Huns,</hi> threatened <hi>Italy</hi>
with total Deſolation; that Scourge of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> as he was
juſtly denominated, having cauſed <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and
<hi>Italy,</hi> to be laid Waſte, returned in the Year 453 a ſecond Time
into the laſt-named Country, and deſtroyed <hi>Pavia, Milan, Padua,
Aquilea,</hi> and many other great Towns, the miſerable Remains of whoſe
Inhabitants finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Peopling not only of <hi>Rialto,</hi> but all the
other Iſles of the <hi>Lagunes</hi>; and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Hope of returning
to their ruined Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they cauſed to be tranſported from the <hi>Terra
Firma,</hi> Marble, and other Materials of their demoliſhed Palaces; ſo
that, in the Space of about fifty Years, not only the People of Rank, but even
the Artizans, were conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently lodged. <hi>Padua</hi> being at length
re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and ſeeing <hi>Rialto</hi> become conſiderable, by the
Number of its Inhabitants, the Senate thought proper to ſend Conſuls to
govern the People, with ſome Appearance of Authority; <pb n="246" facs="tcp:1173200202:253"/>
but in Time the richeſt and moſt powerful of the Inhabitants of theſe
Iſles got themſelves declared Protectors of the People, with the Title of
Tribunes. In the Year 709, the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the twelve moſt conſiderable
Iſlands of the <hi>Lagunes,</hi> judging it neceſſary to have a better
Form of Government, reſolved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Republic, and to elect a proper
Perſon from among themſelves to be their Chief or Prince; but as they knew
they had no Right to take this Step againſt the Will of the
<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duans,</hi> to whom they were indebted for the Place of their
Reſidence, they ſent an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to the Emperor LEO, who was Sovereign
of the whole Country, and to Pope JOHN the Fifth, to obtain their
Permiſſion to elect a Prince, to whom they gave the Title of Doge. PAOLO
LUCE ANAFESTE, the firſt Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> was elected 288 Years after
<hi>Rialto</hi> was proclaimed a free Port by the <hi>Paduans.</hi> This
Election was made at <hi>Ereclea,</hi> a Town of the <hi>Lagunes,</hi> in the
Year 709; at this Place, the firſt three Doges reſided. Theſe Princes
ruled with abſolute Power till 1172, when, upon the Election of SEBASTIAN
ZIANI, the Form of Government became democratical, and <pb n="247" facs="tcp:1173200202:254"/>
continued ſo till 1289, when the Doge, PIETRO GRADENIGO, found Means to
change it to an Ariſtocracy; this he effected by getting a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree paſſed
in the <hi>Quarantia Criminale,</hi> that all thoſe who had compoſed the
great Council for four Years, ſhould be ballotted for in that Chamber of
Juſtice, and ſuch of them who had twelve Balls in their Favour, and who
attended the Council on a certain Day, at an appointed Hour, ſhould have
their Names written in a Book, called <hi>Il Libro d'Oro,</hi> and that they
and their Deſcendants ſhould form the great Council forever. As this
Intrigue was managed with much Secrecy, none had Notice to attend, but thoſe
whom the Doge and his Party approved of, or who had Friends in the
<hi>Quarantia.</hi> When this choſen Number were aſſembled, at the
Ringing of a Bell, the Doors were locked, and no more ſuffered to enter. This
the <hi>Venetians</hi> call 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Il Serrar del Canſiglio,</hi>"</q> and is one
of the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Epochas of their Government: though this Step
wreſted all Share of the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the Hands of the Citizens,
and unjuſtly deprived ſome Families of their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to Nobility, yet it was
owing to this Event, <pb n="248" facs="tcp:1173200202:255"/> that the Republic eſtabliſhed a
more perfect Form of Government than ſhe before enjoyed, and which continues,
with very little Change, to this Day. BAYAMONTE TIEPOLI, the Head of one of the
moſt antient Families of the Republic, joined the <hi>Quirini,</hi> and
ſome other illuſtrious Perſons, in a Conſpiracy to ſacrifice the Doge
to their Reſentment, for this Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but all the Conſpirators
periſhed in the Enterpriſe, and this Attempt only occaſioned freſh
Regulations, which more ſecurely eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the new Form of
Government.</p>

            <p>I Promiſed in my laſt to introduce you to the Doge of
<hi>Venice,</hi> and I think you will agree with me, that his Serenity is a
very uncomfortable Being. Since the Period of <hi>Il Serrar del
Conſiglio,</hi> his Power has gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually decreaſed. A Procurator of St.
<hi>Mark</hi> is generally elected Prince, who has ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Republic in
expenſive Embaſſies, or in the firſt Offices of the State. Although he
has the Name of Sovereign, the Power remains with the Senate; and having little
Influence in the Affairs of the State, great Wiſdom is by no Means an
eſſential Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to this high Rank; an advanced Age, an eaſy
Diſpoſition, and illuſtrious Birth, are the Qualifications chiefly
ſought for in the Doge; his Children, Grand-Children, and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are
diſqualified from holding any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable <pb n="250" facs="tcp:1173200202:257"/>
Employment connected with Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment during his Reign. His Wife was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
treated <hi>en Princeſſe,</hi> and crowned with great Magnificence, but
that cuſtom is now exploded; however, ſhe ſtill retains the Title of
<hi>Dogereſſa.</hi> Though the Doge preſides at all the Councils, he is
only acknowledged Head of the Senate, at the Tribunals, and in the Palace of
St. <hi>Mark.</hi> He cannot leave the City without the previous Leave of his
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors; he is allowed no Marks of Diſtinction in his Dreſs or
Equipage when he makes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Viſits, or leaves the City, except that his
Family are ſuffered to uſe Gold or Silver Lace on their Liveries, and in
the Ornaments of their Box at the Theatre; and the Ladies wear rich coloured
Cloaths at public Feſtivals, when the <hi>Pragmatica</hi> obliges the other
noble <hi>Venetians</hi> to appear in black. Upon public Occaſions, his
Serenity generally wears a Veſt and Ducal Mantle of Brocade of Gold or
Silver, lined with Ermine, a Cap of Crimſon Velvet, with a Border of Gold, to
repreſent the Diadem, and under it a ſhort Hood of Gauze, and Shoes of
Crimſon Damaſk. The Sword of State is carried after the Prince, and 
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:1173200202:258"/> at the Head of the Seignory, to ſhew where the real
Power is lodged. A folding Chair, with a gilt Frame, and a Seat of Brocade,
with a Stool of the ſame to ſet his Foot on, and a large Pariſole of Gold
Stuff, are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the Doge in all public Proceſſions, and they
pretend that this Regalia was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the famous SEBASTIAN ZIANI by
Pope ALEXANDER the Third, in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Protection he received from
the Republic, when oppreſſed by the Emperor FREDERICK the Second. The Doge
has the Title of Serenity and Serene Prince, but to ſhew that they are not
attached to his Perſon alone, Ambaſſadors uſe them in his Abſence in
addreſſing the College. Though all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches are written in the Name of
the Prince, and the Anſwers addreſſed to him, yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not open them
without the Members of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege being preſent, whereas they can open, and
even anſwer them, without his being preſent; and to ſhew that his Power
and Influence is merely imaginary, the Senate neither propoſe any
Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or take any Reſolution, till he and his Counſellors are
withdrawn; they then examine the Affairs under Debate, take the Advice of 
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1173200202:259"/> the Savi, and prepare their Deliberations in Writing, to
be carried to the firſt Meeting of the Senate, where the Doge and his
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors are preſent, who have a Voice to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove or diſapprove in
common with the other Senators. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Money bears the Name of
the Doge, and was formerly ſtamped as his Coin, when the Power of the Prince
was abſolute; at preſent is ſubſtituted the Figure of a Man in the
Ducal Habit on his Knees before St. <hi>Mark,</hi> to ſhew that the Doge is
ſubject to the Republic, of which St. <hi>Mark</hi> is the Hieroglyphic. The
Income of the Prince is fourteen thouſand Ducats <hi>per Annum,</hi> (which
amounts to about two thouſand Pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) to maintain his Family, and
to defray the Expence of treating the Seignory four Times a Year. The foreign
Ambaſſadors, who have made their public Entry, have a Right to be at
theſe Feaſts. The Republic pay all the Officers who attend the Prince on
public Occaſions: he has the Power of ſelling the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Employments of
the Palace, in which, and collating the Benefices of St. <hi>Mark,</hi>
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the principal Emoluments of his Dignity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:1173200202:260"/>When the Doge dies, his Body is embalmed, and
expoſed for three Days on a Bed of State, in an Apartment of the Palace
deſtined for that Purpoſe. This Expoſition is not only to give the People
an Opportunity to pay the laſt Honours to their Prince, but alſo to give
the Senate Time to receive any Complaints againſt his Adminiſtration, and
to give his Creditors Leiſure to make their Demands on his Heirs, which if
they refuſe to ſatisfy, he is deprived of funeral Honours at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of the Republic: for this Reaſon, on the Death of a Doge, three Inquiſitors
are appointed to ſearch into his paſt Conduct, to hear all Complaints, and
to ſatisfy all Demands at the Expence of the Succeſſion. The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles who
aſſiſt at the Funeral, are dreſſed in Scarlet Robes, to ſhew that
it is not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Prince that cauſes the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the
State, and that the Republic being free, ought not to ſhew any Marks of
Affliction at his Death. The Obſequies are no ſooner over, than all the
Nobles, who are more than thirty Years of Age, aſſemble in the great
Council-Chamber, and elect five Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors, <pb n="254" facs="tcp:1173200202:261"/> who
inſpect the Book of Statutes that the Doge, on his Election, ſwears to
obſerve. Theſe five Noblemen have a Right to add to, or to retrench from
theſe Statutes, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they think neceſſary for the Good of the State.
The Ballotation upon this Occaſion is managed with ſo much Caution, that it
is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any Thing but Chance to decide which ſhall be the
forty-one Senators choſe out of the whole Number to elect a Succeſſor to
the deceaſed Prince. When theſe Electors have been approved by the general
Council, they are ſhut up in the Palace of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and not
ſuffered to ſtir out until the Election is over; twenty-five of the
forty-one Voices muſt be in Favour of the Perſon that is choſen. The
firſt Thing required of the Doge is, to ſwear to the Obſervance of the
Book of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. He then ſhews himſelf to the People, and in going out of
the Palace for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, paſſes through the Chamber in which his
Body is to be expoſed after his Death, and <hi>there</hi> he receives from
the Grand Chancellor the firſt Compliments on his new Dignity. He then gets
into a Machine, not unlike a great Tub, and two hundred Men, who belong to 
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:1173200202:262"/> the Arſenal, carry him by Turns round the Place of St.
<hi>Mark</hi> on their Shoulders. The Doge thus ſeated, one of his Children,
or ſome near Relation, ſtands behind him, holding two Baſons filled with
Money, which he diſtributes among the Populace.</p>
            <p>Having killed one Prince, and proclaimed another, I think I may
decently take my Leave for the preſent; and ſhould you be as tired with
reading, as I am with writing, you will wiſh you had never heard of his
Serenity. I hope you will think my next more intereſting, which will treat of
the different Councils of <hi>Venice.</hi>

            <p>HAVING in my laſt diſpatched his Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity the Doge, I now
proceed with Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity to give you an Account of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, of which,
according to AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAIE, there are three principal; the great one,
which comprehends all the Nobility; the College, which gives Audience to
Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors; and the Pregadi, which is the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. The Great-Council
meets every <hi>Sunday</hi> and Holiday to chuſe Magiſtrates, which is done
by Ballotation. The Nobles have no Right to enter into it, until they are
twenty-five Years old, but the Seignory diſpenſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with their
being under Age. This Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly has a Right of confirming or annulling the
Decrees of the Senate, and to make or repeal Laws. The moſt remarkable
ſtanding Laws are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that all Eccleſiaſtics are 
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:1173200202:264"/> excluded from every civil Employment and public
Aſſembly. The Nobles cannot arrive at the principal Offices, but by
Gradation; nor can they hold more than one Office at once, be it ever ſo
ſmall. Thoſe who refuſe any Employment, are fined two thouſand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats,
and baniſhed for two Years from the Great Council and Broglio; (this Name
they give to an Apartment under the <hi>Procuratia Nuova,</hi> where the
Noblemen meet in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and thoſe who are trying to attain any Place in
the Government, uſe this Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſolicit the Votes of their Friends
for their Ballotation in the Great Council.) No Magiſtrate can reſign, or
leave the City. All the Sons of the Nobility have equal Portions: if a Daughter
has more than five thouſand Ducats, (about ſix hundred Pounds ſterling)
ſhe receives the Income of the Overplus for her own ſeparate Uſe, and if
ſhe dies without Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it returns to her Family. All Subjects of the
Republic (the Doge not excepted) pay Taxes in Proportion to their Fortune. The
Magiſtrates in civil Cauſes can receive no Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits or Recommendation of
the Parties, but may in criminal ones, if they are not State 
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:1173200202:265"/> Affairs. No Nobleman can enter into Trade. The Great
Council corrects all public Errors, and redreſſes all Grievances impoſed
by thoſe who uſe their Authority unlawfully, ſo that this may be called
the firſt Tribunal, and the Baſis, as well as Support of the Republic.</p>
            <p>To gratify the young Nobility, they admit thirty by Lot every Year
into the Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who are only twenty Years of Age, and allow them the
ſame Privileges as thoſe who are twenty-five; theſe young ones are called
<hi>Barbarini,</hi> becauſe they are choſen on the Day of St. BARBARA. This
Aſſembly ſits from eight in the Morning until Noon; it is held in the
largeſt Room of the Palace: at the upper End are raiſed Seats, on which the
Doge and his Counſellors are placed. The Chief of the Council of Ten, the
Avoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores and the Cenſors are ſeated round the Hall, upon raiſed
Benches. The Counſellors of the Doge can convoke, at Pleaſure, the Great
Council, and for this Purpoſe they cauſe the Bells of the principal
Churches in the ſix Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Town to be rung, and at this Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
the Nobles attend the Council without <pb n="259" facs="tcp:1173200202:266"/> Arms, which they
are forbid to carry there on Pain of Death.</p>
            <p>When AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAIE wrote his Hiſtory of the Republic of
<hi>Venice,</hi> the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were computed at five and twenty Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; but
they now fall very ſhort of that Calculation. The Great Council uſually
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of about eight hundred, and nearly the ſame Number is
ſuppoſed to be employed in the Provinces, on Embaſſies, and other
public Services; or, for private Reaſons, are not in a Situation to attend in
Council.</p>
            <p>THE COLLEGE.</p>
            <p>THE College is formed of twenty-ſix Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>viz.</hi> The
Doge and his ſix Counſellors, three of the <hi>Quarantia Criminale,</hi>
(who are changed every two Months) ſix <hi>Savi Grandi,</hi> five of the
<hi>Savi</hi> of the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> and the five <hi>Savi</hi> of Order.
The College has the Right of aſſembling the Senate, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what
is to be debated therein; but yet they muſt obey its Reſolutions, and act
in <pb n="260" facs="tcp:1173200202:267"/> Concert with it. At this Tribunal the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of
the Prince may be ſaid to reſide, for here the Ambaſſadors have their
Audience, all Letters upon foreign Affairs are read, all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials are
preſented, and all Privileges, in Regard to Benefices, Prelates, <hi>&amp;c.
&amp;c.</hi> are pleaded. In ſhort, this is the Committee of Ways and Means,
where all Buſineſs is firſt planned, in order to be laid before the
Senate for their Concurrence.</p>
            <p>THE SENATE.</p>
            <p>THE Senate had formerly the Name of <hi>Pregadi</hi> given to it,
becauſe it then never aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled but upon extraordinary Occaſions; and
the Magiſtrates were obliged to requeſt the Attendance of the principal
Citizens, when any important Affair required their Advice. This Aſſembly
now meets every <hi>Wedneſday</hi> and <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> and, upon an
Emergency, the <hi>Savi</hi> for the Week can call an extraordinary
<hi>Pregadi.</hi> This Tribunal poſſeſſes all the Authority of the
Republic, for here all Reſolutions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Peace and War are taken, all
Leagues <pb n="261" facs="tcp:1173200202:268"/> and Alliances are made, Ambaſſadors and
alſo Officers who have conſiderable Rank in the Army are nominated, and all
Taxes are impoſed according to the Exigency of Affairs. The Conſultations
of the College are here examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and determined by a Plurality of Voices. This
Inſtitution in its Commencement was only compoſed of ſixty Senators,
called an <hi>ordinary Pregadi</hi>; but being often obliged, in Caſes of
Importance, to add to the Number, ſixty more were created, called the
<hi>Junto:</hi> theſe hundred and twenty Senators are always No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen of
advanced Age and approved Merit. The Members of the College, the Council of
Ten, the <hi>Quarantia Criminale,</hi> the Procurators of St. <hi>Mark,</hi>
with moſt Part of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, enter alſo into the <hi>Pregadi,</hi>
ſo that it now conſiſts of near three hundred Members, one Part whereof
have a Right to vote, the reſt can only hearken and learn the Rules of
Government. The Doge and his Counſellors are the only Perſons whoſe
Advice can be bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted, to prevent the Confuſion that would probably
ariſe from a Diverſity of Opinions, as half the Votes muſt be in Favour
of the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before it can paſs. Thoſe who have no 
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:1173200202:269"/> Right to vote, may harangue and contradict the Opinions
propoſed. The hundred and twenty, who compoſe the ordinary <hi>Pregadi</hi>
and <hi>Junto,</hi> are ballotted every Year in the Great Council, to be
changed or continued, as ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in the ſaid Council. The
Senate is particularly attentive in maintaining Harmony among the Nobles; well
knowing, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Behaviour might be productive of fatal Conſequences
to the Liberty of the Country, as was formerly the Caſe with
<hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Verona.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The COUNSELLORS of the DOGE.</p>
            <p>THE Counſellors of the Doge (or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of the Signory) are
ſix in Number, they are choſen from amongſt the oldeſt Senators of the
firſt Rank; though they are Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors for a Year, they only aſſiſt
in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege eight Months; the other four Months they preſide in the
<hi>Quarantia Criminale,</hi> in the ſame Manner as the Chiefs of that
Chamber have places in the College during two Months. Theſe ſix
Counſellors have more Power than the Doge; <pb n="263" facs="tcp:1173200202:270"/> their
Employment is two-fold: firſt, they are obliged to conſult with the Doge
upon all Matters that are to be propoſed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, to open all
Letters directed to the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nory, to receive Petitions, and to appoint Judges
to ſettle any Diſpute which may ariſe about Juriſdiction; and
ſecondly, to preſide at all Councils, and, during an <hi>Interregnum,</hi>
to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch Orders to all the Officers of the State. When the Doge is ill,
the moſt antient of the Counſellors repreſent him in the College, and at
all public Functions: but he is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther allowed to ſit in the ducal Chair,
or wear the Habit of the Prince, and is only diſtinguiſhed by a Cap which
he never takes off, no more than the Doge does his ducal Crown. The
Counſellors, whilſt in Office, wear ſcarlet Gowns.</p>
            <p>As I ſhall, in my next, introduce you to a Tribunal ſo awful,
that the bare Name makes thouſands tremble, I ſhall allow myſelf ſome
Reſpite for the preſent, and endeavour to loſe the Idea of theſe dry
intricate Subjects in the more pleaſing ones of <hi>Virtù.</hi>

            <p>I Promiſed, in my laſt, to introduce you to the moſt
tremendous Tribunal, that, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ever poor Culprits trembled before, if we
view it in its original State: but I think all the ſenſible People, I have
converſed with in <hi>Venice,</hi> agree, that it is ſomewhat relaxed, from
its primitive Severity, though ſtill to be dreaded for the Extent of Power,
the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors of State are entruſted with.</p>
            <p>The INQUISITION.</p>
            <p>THIS Tribunal is compoſed of two of the Council of Ten, and one of
the Counſellors of the Doge. As the Affairs, that fall under the Cognizance
thereof are of the utmoſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the State, depending chiefly upon
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Intelligences collected by Spies, ſo all their Proceedings are
managed with the deepeſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy; and, in ſome Caſes, they are obliged 
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:1173200202:273"/> to uſe Severity, and to puniſh Offenders in a very
exemplary Manner, The Life of the Doge, the Nobles, and all the Subjects of the
State, lie at the Mercy of this Tribunal, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the three Inquiſitors
entirely concur in Opinion; and in this Caſe, they are not obliged to give an
Account of their Actions to any one, or even communicate them to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of Ten. The Execution of the Sentences pronounced by theſe Judges is not
leſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret than their Judgments, except when the Crime is of a public
Nature: in private Caſes, to prevent Exclamations againſt ſuch ſeeming
Severity, as often puniſhes with Death an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded Expreſſion againſt
ſo rigorous a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, (it is ſaid) they ſend in the Night, and have
the Offender ſeized, and pronounce his Doom, without any other Ceremony, than
confronting him with two Witneſſes, if there are any, or elſe, on the
bare Report of Spies. As many Inconveniencies have ariſen from this
deſpotic Method of Proceeding, a Law has been provided, that the
Inquiſitors ſhall not put to Death a noble Venetian, without firſt
hearing his Defence. If a Stranger of any Conſequence becomes ſuſpected
by this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, <pb n="267" facs="tcp:1173200202:274"/> he muſt expect to loſe his
Papers, and receive an Order, ſigned by one of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors, requiring
him to leave the State within a limited Time, on Pain of Death. As the
<hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility, of every Claſs, are forbid to hold any Sort of
Correſpondence with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, or foreign Miniſters, or even with
the meaneſt Perſon in their Families, it is for this Intent, that the Spies
of the Inquiſitors are particularly vigilant in collecting Matter of
Complaint.</p>
            <p>Harſh as the Proceedings of this Tribunal muſt appear to
<hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> who are bleſſed with the happieſt Form of
Government, the ſenſible and unprejudiced MONTESQUIEU aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, that it
has often ſaved the Republic of <hi>Venice</hi> from total Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The COUNCIL OF TEN.</p>
            <p>THIS was orignally, a mere temporary Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Juſtice,
appointed to enquire into the famous Conſpiracy of TIEPOLI: but was ſoon
after made perpetual, and is now one of the <pb n="268" facs="tcp:1173200202:275"/> moſt
reſpectable Tribunals of the Republic; it takes Cognizance of all the
criminal Affairs among the Nobility, that happen in the City, or State of
<hi>Venice,</hi> and judges Crimes of <hi>Leze Majeſté,</hi> and all
other attrocious Offences. This Council has the Care of the public
Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and their Power is as much to be dreaded by the Nobles, as by the
common People. The Doge and his Counſellors have a Right to enter this
Chamber of Juſtice; but the ten Senators, of whom it is compoſed, have not
leſs Power in the Abſence of the Doge, than when he is preſent: they are
choſen out of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Families, and are elected in the Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
every Year; they then elect three among themſelves to be the Head of the
Councils; theſe rule Week about, and are changed every three Months. The
Chief in Office receives all Informations from Spies, and reports them to his
Colleagues, who, upon the Depoſition of Witneſſes, and the Anſwers of
the accuſed, proceed againſt them before the Council, where the Offender is
not allowed to plead for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf perſonally, or by Lawyer. The armed
Galley that always lies at St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Place, and ſome Cannon and
Gallies at the Arſenal, <pb n="269" facs="tcp:1173200202:276"/> are under the Command of the
Council of Ten. They meet only once a Week, unleſs ſome Affair of
Importance calls them oftener together.</p>
            <p>The <hi>QUARANTIA CRIMINALE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE are three Courts of Juſtice, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt each of forty
Judges; the firſt of theſe is the moſt antient Tribunal of the Republic,
but it has ſuffered a great Diminution of Power by the Eſtabliſhment of
the Council of Ten. The forty Judges of the upper Chamber have a Right to vote
in the Senate; and the three Chiefs, who are Preſidents, have likewiſe
Seats in the College, during the two laſt Months they are in Office; and
three of the Counſellors of the Doge preſide in the <hi>Quarantia
Criminale,</hi> the four laſt Months of their Year, to ſhew the Connexion
there is between this Chamber and the College. This Office is generally filled
by Noblemen who are not rich; they receive thirty Ducats <hi>per</hi> Month by
it, and acquire Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration among the Nobility. To arrive at this Chamber,
they muſt paſs through the <pb n="270" facs="tcp:1173200202:277"/> other <hi>Quarantias</hi>
firſt, which are much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in Authority. Beſides theſe, there are
many other lower Courts of Juſtice that take Cognizance of mercantile
Affairs, Bankrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> It is worthy of Obſervation,
in this wiſe and intricate Government, how all the ſuperior Tribunals are
interwoven with, and, if I may uſe the Expreſſion, germinate from, each
other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SAVI GRANDI.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE Magiſtrates are ſix in Number; they are choſen from
among the wiſeſt of the Senators, and, during the Time they are in office,
manage all political Affairs of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and are, properly ſpeaking,
prime Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: they are elected by the Senate, and changed every ſix
Months, three at a Time, by which Means, there remain three old Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators in
Office, who are able to inform the new elected ones, of what happened during
their Adminiſtration, and ſerves as a model for the future Conduct of the
new Miniſters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:1173200202:278"/>
               <hi>SAVI</hi> of the <hi>TERRA FIRMA.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE five Officers of the State have little leſs Authority in the
College than the <hi>Savi Grandi</hi>; they are the ſame Length of Time in
Office, are choſen of a leſs advanced Age, and are preferred according to
their Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Abilities they have ſhewn in the Offices they
muſt neceſſarily have paſſed through to arrive at this. The firſt,
or <hi>Savi Caſhier,</hi> is Pay-Maſter; the ſecond, <hi>Savi degli
Scritura,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary at War, and the third, <hi>Savi</hi> of the
Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, has the Direction of the Military of the <hi>Terra Firma</hi>; the
other two are only to aſſiſt the three firſt. They are elected by the
Senate, as the <hi>Savi Grandi,</hi> and have a Right to vote on every Motion,
which may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by them; but, to preſerve a Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between
the two Offices, have no Right to vote in the Senate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SAVI</hi> of ORDER.</p>
            <p>THIS Magiſtracy is the ſame in Number as the <hi>Savi</hi> of
the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> but is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <pb n="272" facs="tcp:1173200202:279"/>
Juriſdiction, and is only a School, as it were, wherein the young Nobility
may learn the Art of Government. Theſe Noblemen, during the ſix Months they
are in Office, aſſiſt at all the Conſultations of the College, and
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have a Share in the Secrets of State; they have no Right to
vote either in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege or Senate, but may give their Opinion at the
Conſultations of the <hi>Savi,</hi> always ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncovered and
ſtanding. They are allowed to ſee all the Diſpatches that are ſent to
Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, and the Regiſters of the Affairs of State. This Employment
is looked upon by the Republic, as the Touchſtone of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and
Genius of their young Nobility.</p>
            <p>PROCURATORS of ST. <hi>MARK.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Honour is generally beſtowed on ſuch of the Nobility who
have been of eſſential Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to their Country in expenſive
Embaſſies, in a naval Command, or for having gone through the moſt
important Employments of the State with Honour and Integrity. The Procurators
take Place of all the other Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; <pb n="273" facs="tcp:1173200202:280"/> they have the
Diſpoſal of all pious Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies, are the Guardians of Orphans, and
Protectors of Widows. The Number was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly confined to nine, but is now
encreaſed to eleven. In preſſing Neceſſities of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, this
Dignity has been ſold for immenſe Sums; but, except in Caſes of public
Diſtreſs, it can only be diſpoſed of by Merit; and thoſe who
purchaſe it never have any Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors appointed when they die. Their
Dreſs is a purple Robe. The magnificent Buildings on each Side of St.
<hi>Mark</hi>'s Place, were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally deſtined for the Habitation of the
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curators, and from thence called <hi>Procuratias</hi>; but they are now
chiefly rented to Strangers and foreign Miniſters, by Way of
<hi>Caſinos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The GRAND CHANCELLOR.</p>
            <p>THIS Dignity can only be enjoyed by a Perſon of the Rank of
Citizen; he takes Place of all the other Magiſtrates, and wears a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Robe, like the Procurators of St. <hi>Mark.</hi> All the Councils are open to
him; he holds the Seal of the Republic, and aſſiſts at read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:1173200202:281"/> and anſwering the Diſpatches from Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,
and every Thing elſe material that is treated of in the Senate. He has the
Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Excellenza,</hi> and is the Head of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as the Doge is
of the Nobility. His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come is about nine thouſand Ducats <hi>per
An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> He is buried with great Pomp, at the Expence of the Republic.</p>
            <p>The <hi>AVOGADORES.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Office reſembles, in Part, that of Attorney-General in
<hi>England,</hi> but is divided among three People; the greateſt Inſtance
of its Power is, being able, for the Space of three Days, to ſuſpend the
Judgment of all the other Courts of Juſtice, when the Crime is not clearly
proved upon the Culprit. In this Particular, the <hi>Avogador</hi> reſembles
the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Tribunes of the People. They are elected by the Senate, but
the Choice muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Grand Council, where all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
would be null, if one of the <hi>Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadores</hi> did not aſſiſt. Their
Dreſs, when in Office, is a purple Robe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:1173200202:282"/>The TWO CENSORS.</p>
            <p>THE Juriſdiction of the Cenſors extends principally to the
Manners of particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; to the Intrigues of the Nobles in the
<hi>Broglio</hi>; to the Condemnation and Fining of thoſe who violate the
Statutes of the Great Council; to the Payment of Wages, Pilfering of Servants,
and Correction of <hi>Gondaliers.</hi> They are ſixteen Months in Office;
during which Term, they have a Right to vote in the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadi,</hi> and wear

            <p>WITH your Leave, my good Friend, I am going to engage you in a
little Trip to the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> in Order to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you to the
<hi>Podeſtàs</hi> and <hi>Capitanios,</hi> a Set of Gentlemen of no
ſmall Conſequence, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, in their reſpective
Governments.</p>
            <p>To the greater Towns of the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> the Senate ſend
two Noblemen, with the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of <hi>Podeſtà</hi> and
<hi>Capitanio</hi>; theſe equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Republic, the firſt in
the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration <pb n="277" facs="tcp:1173200202:284"/> of civil Juſtice, the ſecond
in the Command of Military Affairs. The <hi>Podeſtà</hi> is the
principal Perſon, as he takes Cognizance of all that regards the Police, and
the good Order of the People. The <hi>Capitanio,</hi> beſides the Command of
the Troops, has Power to puniſh the Inhabitants for any Crime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in
the Streets, during the Courſe of the Night. He has alſo the Care of the
public Money, which is collected by Receivers, who are accountable to him for
it. The <hi>Podeſtàs</hi> and <hi>Capitanios</hi> are obliged to
report to the Senate every Meaſure they take. To the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals of Provinces
are generally ſent both the above-mentioned Officers; but in Towns of ſmall
Importance, the two Offices are united in the Perſon of the
<hi>Podeſtà,</hi> who holds his Employment ſixteen Months. The
Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments allowed them by the Republic are very ſmall, in Compariſon to
what they are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſpend in the Capitals, therefore to them the Senate
generally ſends rich Noblemen, and poor ones to the ſmall Towns, where, not
being obliged to make an expenſive Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they may, if they pleaſe,
gain a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable <pb n="278" facs="tcp:1173200202:285"/> Subſiſtence by their Poſt,
during the Time they are employed in it.</p>
            <p>A Nobleman of the firſt Rank is always ſent into the
<hi>Frioul,</hi> with the Title of <hi>Provedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore-General</hi> of <hi>Palma
Nova</hi>; this Place is of great Conſequence to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as
it ſerves for a Frontier to the Emperor's Dominions, and is a ſtrong
Barrier againſt the Incurſions of the <hi>Turks.</hi> At <hi>Udeney,</hi>
where the Patriarch of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> reſides, the Republic employs only a
Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant and ſome Subalterns. In <hi>Iſtria</hi> are four epiſcopal
Towns, with five others not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, each of them governed by a
<hi>Podeſtà.</hi> The Commanding-Officers of theſe Places, as well
as thoſe of the <hi>Levant</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> are changed only once
in two Years. The Senate gives the Title of Counts, Governors, and Captains, to
the Noblemen who are ſent into <hi>Dalmatia</hi> to adminiſter Juſtice.
The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of the principal Towns, (for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Counts of
<hi>Spalatro</hi> and <hi>Gara,</hi> who are likewiſe Archbiſhops) have
appointed to them a Council of three noble <hi>Venetians,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom
they cannot determine on any Thing; but all theſe Officers are ſubject to
the <hi>Prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditore-General,</hi> 
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:1173200202:286"/> who has full
Authority in all Affairs civil and military. The Iſles of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuzant</hi>
and <hi>Cephalonia,</hi> are each governed by a <hi>Proveditore,</hi>
aſſiſted by a Council of three noble <hi>Venetians. Corfu</hi> is a Place
of great Importance, as it commands the Entrance of the Gulph, and is the
Repoſitory of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Merchandize brought from the
<hi>Levant</hi>; this Place is regarded by the <hi>Turks</hi> with a jealous
Eye. There is alſo a General of theſe three Iſles, to whom the particular
<hi>Proveditores</hi> render Obedience, as the Magiſtrates of the Towns in
<hi>Dalmatia</hi> do to the <hi>Proveditore-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>INQUISITORS of the <hi>TERRA FIRMA.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>EVERY five Years, Inquiſitors are ſent to hold Courts in the
ſeveral Provinces of the <hi>Terra Firma</hi>; their Buſineſs is to
inſpect into the Conduct of <hi>Podeſtàs</hi> and
<hi>Capitanios,</hi> and to receive all Complaints of Mal-adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
Juſtice. Their Cenſures are ſeldom ſevere, but when there are Proofs of
Embez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zlement of the public Money, and in that <pb n="280" facs="tcp:1173200202:287"/> Caſe,
their Office obliges them to act with the utmoſt Rigour. They are attended by
a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Cavalry, and an Executioner, that they may puniſh on the Spot
all Offences that are clearly proved. This gives the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials a very high
Idea of the Juſtice of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Government.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Gli Sopre Proveditore alle Pompe,</hi> are Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who by
ſtrict Ordinances ſuppreſs all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Marks of Luxury, and preſerve
an exact Equality, in the exterior Appearance of the Nobility. At public
Feaſts, the Dreſs of the Ladies is always black, except on ſome
Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, when they are allowed to wear a rich gold or ſilver Stuff
Petticoat with their black Gowns. The noble <hi>Venetians</hi> are not
ſuffered to uſe gold or ſilver Lace on their Boatmen's Liveries, or in
their Boxes at the Theatres, except the Doge's Family and the Grand
Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's. In Maſking-Time, the Ladies may wear rich coloured Cloaths,
which is about ſix Months in the Year; and when they are 
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:1173200202:288"/> at their Eſtates on the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> they may
give as rich Liveries as they chooſe, but the Servants who wear them never
attend them at <hi>Venice,</hi> but in their own Houſes.</p>
            <p>REVENUES and EXPENCES of the STATE.</p>
            <p>THE ſettled Revenue of the Republic is ſuppoſed, at preſent,
according to the beſt Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, to amount to about a Million and a Half
ſterling <hi>per Annum</hi>; this is raiſed by Imports and Exports, and
Taxes upon all the Proviſions conſumed in the City of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> and
upon all Sorts of Merchandizes, and by other Duties raiſed in the Iſles of
the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunes,</hi> and upon all the Eſtates ſituated near
<hi>Venice,</hi> called the <hi>Dogado</hi> or Dutchy. Another Part of the
Revenue is raiſed in the ſame Manner from the Towns and Provinces of the
<hi>Terra Firma,</hi> and alſo from <hi>Iſtria, Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and the
Iſles of <hi>Corfu, Zant,</hi> and <hi>Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia.</hi> A large Portion
likewiſe ariſes from the Salt made at <hi>Corfu</hi> and <hi>Chioſa</hi>;
and to this may be added, twenty thouſand Ducats <hi>per</hi> 
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:1173200202:289"/> Month, that are paid into the Coffers of the Republic
from a Lottery, on the ſame Plan as thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> and
<hi>Naples,</hi> which has been eſtabliſhed within theſe thirty Years. In
Time of War, the Senate finds great Reſources by ennobling rich Families,
making ſupernumerary Procurators of St. <hi>Mark</hi>; by renewing old Taxes,
and impoſing new ones. The yearly Expences of Government do not require above
half the Income of the State, ſo that in Time of Peace the Republic can lay
up vaſt Sums; by which Means, the <hi>Venetians</hi> are enabled to negotiate
all their Affairs with foreign Powers by the Force of Money inſtead of
Arms.</p>
            <p>The FORCES of the REPUBLIC.</p>
            <p>IN Time of Peace, the <hi>Venetians</hi> are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to pay
about twenty-five thouſand Men; but there is ſtrong Reaſon to believe,
that not above one third of them are effective, owing to the Abuſes of the
<hi>Proveditores</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia.</hi> The Infantry are chiefly
<hi>Sclavonians, Morlaques,</hi> and <hi>Albanians</hi>; they are eſteemed
brave Soldiers, and are firmly attached to the <pb n="283" facs="tcp:1173200202:290"/>
               <hi>Venetians,</hi> from an inveterate Hatred to the <hi>Turks,</hi> who are
their natural Enemies. The Cavalry are partly compoſed of the ſame
Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and partly of <hi>Ultramontanes.</hi> The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in Chief muſt
always be a Foreigner, and his Power is ſo over-ruled by the
<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditore-General,</hi> that he has only the Name of Commander of the
Forces. The chief At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Senate is paid to the Marine. They have no
regular naval Force in Time of Peace; but upon an Emergency, can arm thirty
Galleys, able to act againſt their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in a very expeditious Manner.
They always keep ſome Galleys in the <hi>Levant,</hi> with other Veſſels,
to guard the Provinces ſituated near the Sea; theſe are under the Command
of the <hi>Proveditore-General.</hi> A Squadron of ſix Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, and
ſeveral other Veſſels, are likewiſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to cruize about the Mouth
of the Gulph, to ſecure the Traders from the Corſairs, and to make the
Merchants pay their proper Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Nobleman who commands this Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
has the Title of General of the Gulph, his Command continues for three Years.
The Republic, in Peace as well as in War, creates a <hi>Proveditore
General,</hi> who commands both the <pb n="284" facs="tcp:1173200202:291"/> Fleet and Army; he
has an abſolute Power to puniſh with Death all Officers, Soldiers, and
Sailors, and to diſpoſe of all Poſts in the Army and Navy; he reſides
at <hi>Corfu</hi> the firſt three Years he is in Office, and when that Time
is expired, he is obliged to render an Account of his Adminiſtration to the
Senate.</p>
            <p>SPIES and INFORMERS.</p>
            <p>SPIES have ever been looked upon as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Miniſters of
Tyranny; but the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> have found Means to conceal the
Shame of ſuch Miſcreants, by making Mouths of Stone ſpeak for them; for
in many Parts of the Palace of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and in all the Parts of the
City near the public Tribunals, Heads are cut in the Walls with gaping Mouths,
into which they caſt the Notes of Information. If the Informer has no Scruple
to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he goes in Perſon to receive the Reward allowed by Law
on this Occaſion; if he does not chooſe to be known, he ſends a Friend,
with a Piece of Paper that has been torn from that on which the Information was
written, <pb n="285" facs="tcp:1173200202:292"/> and the Money is paid without any other
For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality than comparing the two Pieces of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per together. As the great Maxim
of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> is, that the Safety of the State depends upon their
having exact Intelligence of every Thing that paſſes, eſpecially in the
Families of Ambaſſadors and foreign Miniſters, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible what a
Number of Spies of all Ranks they keep in conſtant Pay. That the
<hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> are often branded with the ridiculous Epithet of
Pantaloons, for this apparent My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriouſneſs in their Syſtem of
Politics, we very well know; but how far they are right or wrong in it, I leave
to better Judgments than mine to determine: this however we muſt allow, that
their Government has ſubſiſted under a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican Form, without any
material Alteration, for a much longer Period of Time than any other Republic
that Hiſtory furniſhes us with an Account of, at leaſt that I can
recollect. I had a great Curioſity, when I came to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> to learn
the Etymology of the Name of <hi>Pantaloon,</hi> and why it is ſo
particularly applied to the <hi>Venetians</hi>; I am told it comes from
<hi>Pianta Leone,</hi> and was firſt appropriated to them for their great
Eagerneſs to plant the <pb n="286" facs="tcp:1173200202:293"/> Standard of <hi>Venice,</hi>
which you know is a Lion, wherever they could by Force or Fraud ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Bit
of Ground large enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. How far this etymological Account of
honeſt <hi>Pantaloon</hi> may ſatisfy you, I know not; but, remember, I do
not vouch for the Reality of it, I only offer it to you as I have received it.
I propoſe by the next Poſt to ſend you a ſuccinct Account of the
Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of proceeding at <hi>Venice</hi> in criminal Caſes, and am, in the

            <p>AN agreeable Excurſion for a few Days into the Country has
prevented my being ſo punctual in my literary Engagement as I have hitherto
been; but I make no Aplogy, <pb n="287" facs="tcp:1173200202:294"/> for I know you never meant
it ſhould interfere with my Amuſements. Now to proceed with my hiſtorical
Anecdotes.</p>
            <p>PROCEEDINGS in CRIMINAL CASES at <hi>VENICE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN a Crime is ſuppoſed to have been committed at
<hi>Venice,</hi> the Courts of Juſtice are more ſolicitous to be
aſcertained of the Fact, than to ſecure the Offender; and when they have
obtained the neceſſary Proofs, they ſend an Officer to enter publicly the
Houſe of the Criminal; and on the Report of this Officer, that he is not be
found, (which is generally the Caſe) they ſummon him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in a longer
or ſhorter Space of Time, according to the Enormity of the Crime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
to anſwer for the Offence, and till that Period is elapſed, the Offender is
ſafe from any Moleſtation, provided he does not appear on the Place of St.
<hi>Mark,</hi> or on the <hi>Rialto</hi>; and he may alſo demand three
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, and if he thinks he cannot find Means to prevent the Affair coming to
a fatal Iſſue, <pb n="288" facs="tcp:1173200202:295"/> he may avoid a Trial, by getting a
Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Boat to convey him to ſome Part of the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> from
whence he may eaſily eſcape out of the State. Hence it proceeds, that
moſt Criminals at <hi>Venice</hi> are judged by Contumacy, which they call
<hi>Bandire:</hi> but this Judgment is always accompanied with Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
proportionable to the Crime; for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the condemned Perſon ſhall
never be able to purchaſe his Pardon; that whoever kills him in the
<hi>Venetian</hi> State ſhall receive a conſiderable Reward, and double the
Sum, if they kill him in any other Territory. If the Crime ſenſibly touches
the Republic, they add to the Reward, the Liberty of delivering a
State-Priſoner: but notwithſtanding this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent great Rigour, there have
been Inſtances of Noblemen who have been guilty of atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Crimes making
their Peace, by Means of great Intereſt. When the Criminal is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and
the Proceſs formed, the <hi>Avogador</hi> names his own Day, and, conducting
the Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prit before his Judges, pleads ſtrongly againſt him, exaggerates
every Particular of his Crime, and concludes with adviſing a ſevere
Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Advocate of the Party accuſed <pb n="289" facs="tcp:1173200202:296"/>
anſwers all the chief Points of the Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and when he has performed
his Part, the Auditors retire, and the Opinion of the <hi>Avogador</hi> is
balloted againſt that of the Chiefs of the <hi>Quarantia,</hi> which is
always the moſt gentle, and the Plurality of Balls determine the Fate of the
Offender. By this Means the Judges decide without giving the Reaſon of their
Opinion, and it is conſequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known who is for, and who is againſt the
Criminal. The Lawyers are obliged to plead in the <hi>Venetian</hi> Dialect,
that the moſt ignorant Auditor may underſtand what paſſes, as well as
the more learned Part of the Aſſembly. The ſevereſt Hardſhip, in the
Courſe of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice at <hi>Venice,</hi> is the Length of Time it takes to
terminate an Affair, owing to the Courts of Juſtice being ſo cloſely
connected, and, if I may be allowed the Expreſſion, playing into each
others Hands; ſo that a poor Wretch is often ſuffered to lie in Gaol for
two or three Years, before he can obtain an hearing, to expiate, as they
pretend, by this Puniſhment, part of his Crime. The frequent Sentences that
are paſſed upon Criminals, condemning them to an horrid obſcure Priſon
for eight or <pb n="290" facs="tcp:1173200202:297"/> ten Years, and often for Life, (where in
Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they ſuffer all the Rigour of extreme Cold, and in Summer of
exceſſive Heat) are certainly more cruel Puniſhments than Death at
once.</p>
            <p>Now in my uſual abrupt Manner, I ſhall conduct you at one Step
from temporal to ſpiritual Affairs, and ſay a few Words of the Church,
whoſe Power is very limited in this Republic.</p>
            <p>The STATE of the CHURCH.</p>
            <p>THE Republic of <hi>Venice</hi> has ever been careful to exclude the
Clergy from their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and from all political Employments, even thoſe
who are noble <hi>Venetians.</hi> The Head of the Church is ſtiled Patriarch
of <hi>Venice,</hi> and Primate of <hi>Dalmatia</hi>; he is always a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
enjoys a good Revenue, makes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable Appearance in public
Proceſſions, but has no Power, even in eccleſiaſtical Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; at all
religious Functions, where the Pope's Nuncio is preſent, the Patriarch is
obliged to ſend the Maſter of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies <pb n="291" facs="tcp:1173200202:298"/> to
aſk his Permiſſion to give the Bleſſing. An Office of Inquiſition
is allowed at <hi>Venice,</hi> but under ſuch Reſtrictions, as render it as
dependent on the political Government as any of the ſecular Tribunals are.
The Holy-Office is compoſed of the Patriarch, the Nuncio, and a Friar, who
has the Title of Father In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor, and two experienced Senators, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
whoſe Preſence and Conſent, all Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are null; by this Means, and
under this Pretext, that Matters brought before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition are contrary
to the Laws and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Republic, the greateſt Affairs of this
Tribunal are reduced to a mere Trifle. The Convents in <hi>Venice</hi> were
formerly ſo ill regulated, that it occaſioned much Scandal; but at
preſent, they are under better Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, for three Magiſtrates are
appointed by the Senate, with an extenſive Authority, to take Cognizance of
all that paſſes in the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Monaſteries; and though the Patriarch
himſelf allows a Prieſt to ſay Maſs in one of their Churches, he is
obliged to obtain a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from one of theſe Magiſtrates
beſides, who limits this Licence to what Time he thinks proper. All the Women
likewiſe who <pb n="292" facs="tcp:1173200202:299"/> perform any Commiſſions for the Nuns,
are obliged, under Penalty of corporal Puniſhment, to have Leave in Writing
to execute them, ſigned by one of the aforeſaid Magiſtrates. The Senate
has, within theſe few Years, made many wiſe and uſeful Reformations in
the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Convents of Friars alſo; and have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from the
Superiors of thoſe Houſes to the Senate, the Power of inflicting capital
Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments and Impriſonment upon the Monks, and only allow them for the
future to impoſe Penances of Faſting, Prayers, and ſuch like conventual
Exerciſes.</p>
            <p>Now we muſt return from ſpiritual to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Affairs again,
that I may have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to introduce you to the <hi>Venetian
No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſe,</hi> who are not a little vain of the great Antiquity of their
Nobility, which they can certainly, many of them at leaſt, authenticate for
ſeveral Ages paſt, better than any other Nation we are acquainted with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:1173200202:300"/>NOBILITY of the FIRST CLASS.</p>
            <p>THE noble <hi>Venetians,</hi> who compoſe the firſt Claſs,
comprehend the Families of the twelve Tribunes who elected the firſt Doge in
709: the <hi>Contarini, Moroſini, Poli, Badovari, Tiepoli, Michele, Sanudi,
Gradenigo, Memo, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, Dondolo,</hi> and <hi>Barozzi.</hi> The four Families
next to theſe in Point of Antiquity, date their Nobility from the Year 800,
when they ſigned the Contract for the Abbey of St. <hi>George</hi> the Great;
theſe are the <hi>Juſtiniani, Cornaro, Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadini,</hi> and <hi>Bembo.</hi>
The firſt are popularly called the twelve Apoſtles, and the laſt the four
Evangeliſts. To this Claſs may be added alſo, eight Families who look
upon themſelves as equal to the firſt, becauſe long before <hi>il Serral
del Conſiglio,</hi> which happened in 1289, they were very conſiderable;
theſe are the <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phini, Quirini, Soranzo, Zorzi,</hi> and
<hi>Marcello</hi>; the other three, by Reaſon of extreme Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are fallen
into total Obſcurity, or perhaps are extinct: in this Claſs too, may be
placed ſome illuſtrious Families, who retired to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> 
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:1173200202:301"/> from the Town of <hi>Acre</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> when
it was deſtroyed by the <hi>Venetian</hi> General TIE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POLI, for having
revolted from its Obedience to the Republic after the firſt Conqueſt of it.
The greateſt Advantage theſe Families derive from their Antiquity is being
more conſidered in the Diſpoſal of public Employments that reflect Honour
on the Poſſeſſors; in Point of Precedency, all the Nobility of
<hi>Venice</hi> rank alike.</p>
            <p>NOBILITY of the SECOND CLASS.</p>
            <p>THIS Claſs is compoſed of thoſe who can produce no authentic
Proof of their Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity earlier than 1289, when their Names were written in
the <hi>Libro d'Oro,</hi> which now contains more than five hundred Families.
It was at that memorable Event, <hi>il Serrar del Conſiglio,</hi> that this
Liſt of the Nobles was firſt made out, and a Law enacted, that if the Names
of their Children were not written in this Book within a certain Time after
their Birth, they ſhould forfeit their Title to Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and this alſo
happens, if the Contract <pb n="295" facs="tcp:1173200202:302"/> of their Parents' Marriage does
not legally paſs the Senate, which it cannot do, if a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Venetian</hi> marries a public Performer, either in the Drama, or Muſic,
one who has been in a State of Servitude, or one whoſe Father is of any
Profeſſion or Trade, excepting a Phyſician, a Manufacturer of gold or
ſilver Silks, or a Maker of Glaſs. As it is now upwards of four hundred
Years ſince <hi>il Serrar del Conſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> this Claſs of Nobles is
highly eſteemed. The moſt conſiderable of theſe Families that ſtill
exiſt, are the <hi>Moncenigo,</hi> the <hi>Capello, Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carini, Foſcari,
Grimani, Gritti, Garzoni, Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, Dona, Nani, Malipiero, Peſoro, Piſani,
Priuli, Ruzzini, Sagredo, Valier, Venier, Baſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dona, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
moſt of theſe have given Doges to the Republic, and the reigning one at
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is a <hi>Moncenigo.</hi> In this Rank are alſo placed thirty
Families that were ennobled nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-one Years later, on the Termination of the
<hi>Genoeſe</hi> War, as a Reward for aſſiſting the State with vaſt
Sums of Momey; the moſt conſiderable of theſe that are remaining are the
<hi>Treviſan, Vendramin, Renier, Juſti,</hi> and
<hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualighi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:1173200202:303"/>After having introduced you to ſo much good
Company, I think you will not be ſorry if I take my Leave for the preſent;
but I cannot do that, without firſt aſſuring you, that I am, with Truth,

            <p>TO proceed with my Subject where I left it in my laſt Letter, I
muſt now talk to you a little of a younger Branch of the <hi>Venetian</hi>
Nobility, whom I ſhall ſtile the third Claſs, and even theſe are
reſpectable for their Antiquity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:1173200202:304"/>NOBILITY of the THIRD CLASS.</p>
            <p>IN this Claſs are comprehended about eighty Families, who
purchaſed their Nobility for an hundred thouſand Ducats each, during the
laſt War of <hi>Candia</hi>; ſome of theſe have remained poor and
diſtreſſed ever ſince, by that Inſtance of their Vanity: the
following are ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable for their Wealth and Alliances, the
<hi>Videman, Labia, Zenobia, Fini, Manini, Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> The
<hi>Savorgnan</hi> gave to the Republic ſome Fortreſſes of great
Importance, for guarding the <hi>Venetitian</hi> Territories from the
Encroachments of the <hi>Turks</hi>; and the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoni</hi> made the State a
Preſent of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Crema,</hi> of which they poſſeſſed
the Seignory; and for theſe free Gifts the two Families received the Honour
of being enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. Though the noble <hi>Venetians</hi> can au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenicate the
Antiquity of their Nobility bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any People perhaps in <hi>Europe,</hi>
yet not content with this Advantage, they are fond of deriving their Families
from fabulous Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals: thus the <hi>Contarini,</hi> from a Similitude 
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:1173200202:305"/> of Name, pretend to be deſcended from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<hi>German</hi> Princes, who were ſtiled Counts of the <hi>Rhine</hi>; the
<hi>Juſtiniani,</hi> who give for their Arms a Spread Eagle, from thence
claim their Deſcent from an Emperor of the Eaſt of their Name. I have been
told a curious Anecdote of this noble Family, that I will relate for your
Amuſement: ſome Centuries paſt, they fitted out a Veſſel, under the
Doge VITAL MICHELE, to fight againſt the Emperor EMANUEL; (who had ill
treated the <hi>Venetians</hi> in the <hi>Levant)</hi> the
<hi>Juſtiniani</hi> were all cut to Pieces, and the only ſurviving Male was
a <hi>Benedictine</hi> Friar, for whom the Doge obtained a Diſpenſation of
his Vows from the Pope, and married him to his Daughter, and from this Couple
are deſcended the preſent Family, according to this Legend, which whether
true or falſe I ſhall not take upon me to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. One Branch of the
<hi>Cornaro</hi> Family ſtile themſelves <hi>Cornaro della Regina,</hi>
from one of their Houſe having been Queen of <hi>Candia</hi>; but this
Alliance is rather a Blot in their Eſcutcheon, if a certain evil Fame may be
relied on, who ſays, that the Huſband of this Lady was an Uſurper, whom
ſhe poiſoned, and <pb n="299" facs="tcp:1173200202:306"/> treacherouſly betrayed the
<hi>Candians</hi> to the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians.</hi> A Gentleman has promiſed to
intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to a Lady of this Name, who is a very agreeable, ſenſible
Woman, and who, he ſays, will ſhew me the complete Ornaments of the
Toilette of the Queen above-mentioned, which is ſtill in the
Poſſeſſion of the Family, and valued by them at many thouſand
Ducats.</p>
            <p>The CITIZENS, or ORDER of SECRETARIES.</p>
            <p>THE Citizens had formerly a large Share in the Government, and
<hi>Venice</hi> would probably have always remained in a State of Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
had not the Reſentment of PIETRO GRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENIGO againſt many of the Claſs,
who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his being choſen Doge, determined him to transfer the Power
entirely from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into the Hands of the Nobility, which he fully
effected by Means of the <hi>Serrar del Conſiglio</hi>; at which Period,
ſeveral of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles loſt their Rank, by not being admitted into the
Secret; and at preſent, by the Word Citizen, (at <hi>Venice)</hi> is meant
the Families thus <pb n="300" facs="tcp:1173200202:307"/> excluded from the Grand Council, many
of whom bear the ſame Name and Arms of the old Nobility; and to theſe may
be added ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who by Merit or Money have obtained the ſame Privileges in the
Republic: they rank with the Nobility of the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> and one at
leaſt of every Family wears the Veſt, the ſame as the noble
<hi>Venetians:</hi> it has been thought, this is allowed them to prevent the
People from obſerving how ſmall a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men they are governed by.
Though, by a ſtanding Law, every noble <hi>Venetian</hi> is forbid to enter
into Trade, yet they often join privately in Commerce with the wealthy
Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, which the Senate winks at, becauſe when they are become opulent,
they can make it turn to the Advantage of the State, by employing them in
expenſive Embaſſies. From among the Citizens are choſen the Secretaries
of the Senate, Secretaries of Embaſſies, and alſo Reſidents at foreign
Courts, for a noble <hi>Venetian</hi> can accept of no Employment of that kind,
but with the Title of Ambaſſador; and, for the ſame Reaſon, the
Republic receives no foreign Miniſter in any intermediate Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter between
a Reſident and an Ambaſſador. <pb n="301" facs="tcp:1173200202:308"/> The Dignity of Grand
Chancellor is always conferred on one of this Claſs; and as it is the
higheſt Honour that can be attained by a Perſon who is not noble, it is
generally given as a Reward to one who has ſerved the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public well in
expenſive Reſidencies. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the <hi>Venetian</hi> State are by
ſome rated, at preſent, at about 2,655,448; but thoſe who have made very
accurate Enquiries upon this Head affirm, that they are over-rated by one
million.</p>
            <p>Thus, my Friend, I have obeyed your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and, in as conciſe
a Manner as I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly could, have endeavoured to give you a juſt Idea
of the very extraordinary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Republic of <hi>Venice</hi>; I
flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that by offering you this at one View, I have ſaved you
the Trouble of turning over ſome Books which, beſides being very dry
read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you might not eaſily have met with: but was this little Extract (or
whatever you are pleaſed to call it) to fall under the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a
leſs indulgent Judgment than yours, I ſhould, with great Reaſon, fear
being charged with having given it in a ſlovenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>correct Manner. I ſhall
only advance, in my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, <pb n="302" facs="tcp:1173200202:309"/> that you well know how
limited my Time is at <hi>Venice,</hi> and how ſtrongly my natural
Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation leads me to a much more entertaining Study than that of Hiſtory;
but to ſuch a Friend as yourſelf, I could not refuſe a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
that it was in my Power to procure you, at the trifling Expence of putting
myſelf, for a few Hours, out of my Way; I only wiſh you may find my Attempt
ſatisfactory. However, before I entirely quit this Subject, I cannot forbear
communicating to you a few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections into which it has naturally led me; it
is melancholy to obſerve, that in a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo wiſe in many of its
Parts, ſuch groſs Errors ſhould be ſuffered to paſs uncorrected, as
muſt in Time moſt certainly deſtroy the whole Syſtem. A total Neglect
evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Education of the young Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which gives them an
Ignorance, I had almoſt ſaid Brutality, that renders them very
diſagreeable in civil Society, and muſt prove an Obſtacle to their
becoming wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Magiſtrates; and, added to this, the
Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs not only permitted, but even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, among the Clergy,
has produced ſuch a ſhameful Neglect in Matters of true 
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:1173200202:310"/> Religion, that Vice and Immorality ſeem to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
among all Ranks of People, which muſt in Time infallibly bring to a final
Diſſolution this once flouriſhing and powerful Republic. How amazingly
muſt the Manners of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> have been corrupted ſince their
firſt Eſtabliſhment, if the Abbate LANGIER has drawn a true Character of
them in his <hi>Storia Veneta,</hi> P. 130, Libro 1. He ſays,
<hi>Eſigevanſi Coſtumi puri, Condotta ſemplice, una Vita labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſia
per Ottenere da Lei la Qualita di Cittadino.</hi> The ſame Author quotes a
Letter, written by CASSIODORUS, who was Miniſter from King THEODORICK to the
Tribunes of the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Iſles, which contains theſe Words, <hi>Più
di ſuſſante piccole Iſole eſſendo ſtate Abitate
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſivamente intorno Rialto per componere al fire queſta Cita
prodigioſa.</hi> P. 160. Libro 2. I have tranſcribed this only by Way of
obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how very early <hi>Rialto</hi> (now called <hi>Venice)</hi> became
a conſiderable Place. LANGIER places the Election of PAOLO LUCIO ANAFESTE,
the firſt Doge, in 697, which is twelve Years ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier than St. DISDIER's
Account, who ſays, this Prince was elected in 709. AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAI, in
his Hiſtory of the Republic <pb n="304" facs="tcp:1173200202:311"/> of <hi>Venice,</hi>
ſays, The Government of <hi>Venice</hi> by Conſuls and Tribunes, which
laſted 270 Years, may be called her Infancy; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotic Reign of the
Doges, from PAOLO LU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIO ANAFESTE to SEBASTIAN RIANI, (which comprehends 463
Years) her Childhood; the Democracy, (which laſted above a Century) her
Youth, which, ſays he, was robuſt and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; but, as it often happens
in ſimilar Caſes, it was diſturbed and agitated by dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Paroxiſms
of Wars and Revolts. Her Virility, he adds, began with <hi>il Serrar del
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiglio,</hi> and laſted till the War of the League of <hi>Cambray,</hi>
in 1309, which may be called the Beginning of her old Age.</p>
            <p>The Republic liberally rewarded SANAZAR for the following very
flattering Epigram:

            <p>THE kind Expreſſions in your welcome Epiſtle, and
ſuperabundant Thanks for my <hi>Venetian</hi> Extract, were, I aſſure
you, a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial to my Heart. I am rejoiced that our worthy Patroneſs has
paſſed ſo good a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and hope the Summer will be ſtill more
propitious to her.</p>
            <p>You will ſee by the Date of this Letter, we have changed our
Situation, and are got to a ſweet Retirement, on the Banks of the
<hi>Brenta</hi>; the Houſe is large, convenient, clean and chearful; the
Gardens ſpacious, and in good Order; and the whole Atmoſphere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed
with Roſes, Jaſmines and Orange Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, which we have in great
Profuſion. The River, which is in the Front of the Houſe, affords a
continual moving Picture of large <pb n="307" facs="tcp:1173200202:314"/> Barges, paſſing to
and fro from <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Padua,</hi> from either of which Places we
can have any Thing brought by Water to the very Door. The north Side of the
River is planted with Foreſt Trees, and the ſouth Side with Vines that hang
in beautiful Feſtoons, ſupported by other Trees: in ſhort, we want
nothing but a few liberal Souls (ſuch as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Party you are
with) in this Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, to render this delicious Spot an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
terreſtrial Paradiſe; yet, I am ſure, whilſt you have the Advantage of
ſuch a Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, you would not exchange your retired Spot for all I have been

            <p>A haſty Summons (on Account of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the Packet that

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I THINK myſelf ſo much obliged to you, for you taking ſo much
Notice of my inſignificant Scrawl, that I am not the leaſt inclined to find
fault with the Length of Time you have taken in anſwering my laſt; and to
ſhew my Sincerity in this Particular, I am ſat down to acknowledge your
Favour, though I have not had it in my Poſſeſſion longer than this
Afternoon, for it has lain ſome Time in <hi>London.</hi> I have been on a
Viſit to a worthy Friend of ours, at this Place, for a Month 
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:1173200202:317"/> paſt, and I aſſure you, I have all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in the World to be ſatisfied with my Journey. Pray, good Sir, did you ever
ſee <hi>Bridgenorth?</hi> I believe not—Very well; then I muſt give
you ſome little Deſcription of this Place, (as I am habituated to do of
every new Spot I tread upon, whether large or ſmall) for I think
<hi>Bridgenorth</hi> is, in Point of Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, by much the prettieſt I ever
ſaw; it is divided into two Pariſhes, diſtinguiſhed by the Names of the
Upper and Lower Town. I was, the other Day, on a Viſit to the Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the
upper Pariſh; the Parſonage-Houſe is a truly Gothic Structure, which
overlooks the Church-Yard, and though I cannot ſay, this is the moſt
<hi>pleaſant,</hi> yet it certainly is not the leaſt <hi>uſeful</hi>
Proſpect in the World, to a ſpeculative Mind. The upper Town is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
on a Cliff, which renders it very whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, both from its Height, and the
Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Air. The View from our back Windows is more beautiful than
any Thing you can imagine: at the Foot of the Hill, the <hi>Severn</hi> rolls
its cryſtal Waves, in a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſerpentine Stream, down to the Banks
whereof, is a Succeſſion of ſloping Gardens, <pb n="311" facs="tcp:1173200202:318"/> that
vie with each other in Beauty, Fragrance, and Order. On the oppoſite Side, in
a Vale, lies the lower Town, and above that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Fields and Meadows,
interſperſed with fine Plantations of Trees of a long Growth. The Grounds,
by an eaſy Aſcent, terminate at laſt in a Common, fifteen Miles long, on
which is a very good Horſe-Courſe; to the left, the Proſpect is bounded
by a very high Rock, and on the right, as far as the Eye can ſtretch, is a
fine open fertile Country; this ſtrong Contraſt has a moſt happy Effect.
A noble Object in this inimitable Landſcape is the Ruin of an old Caſtle,
which, from the Poſition wherein it has been left by a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-Ball, is,
perhaps, one of the greateſt Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities in <hi>Europe</hi>; it ſtrikes
us with Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Awe, while we contemplate its nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Towers, which
look as if they meant to overwhelm the heedleſs Paſſenger in ſudden
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; yet the <hi>Mathematicians</hi> affirm, that nothing leſs
than an Earthquake can move this immenſe Pile of Building. Round it is a
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Walk, where we often repair when the Weather is inviting; but when
this happens not to be the Caſe, we have for our Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:1173200202:319"/> in the Houſe, a <hi>Microſcope,</hi> a reflecting
<hi>Telleſcope,</hi> and a <hi>Camera Obſcura:</hi> the firſt of theſe
is my Favourite; Mr. L—, by the help of it, the other Day, detected a
<hi>Beau</hi> of an <hi>Humble Bee,</hi> in the very Act of ſcratching a
<hi>Louſe</hi> (Oh, ſhameful Truth!) off the downy Part of his Neck, and
this little Animal, though ſcarcely perceptible to the naked Eye, is a moſt
<hi>tremendous</hi> Figure, much reſembling a Hog, in the Glaſs; for my
Part, though I am not apt to be attracted by gaudy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, I am abſolutely
in love with the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant Armour of a green <hi>Beetle,</hi> richly gilded,
with a Sun-Beam. I own to you, my good Friend, I have a hearty Contempt for the
<hi>Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs</hi> of the human Race, who place all their Happineſs in
Dreſs, when I conſider that an humble Moth, in the ſimple Habit which
Nature has given it, far outſhines them in all the Glitter of Lace and
Embroidery.</p>
            <p>Whenever we amuſe ourſelves with theſe Sort of Contemplations,
our <hi>worthy Neighbour the Paſtor,</hi> never fails to make Improvement go
Hand in Hand with Amuſement, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Occaſion to expatiate on the
Wiſdom and <pb n="313" facs="tcp:1173200202:320"/> bounteous Goodneſs of our great Creator,
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified in the moſt minute, as well as in the greateſt Objects of
Nature. This excellent Man edifies his Pariſhioners as much by the exemplary
Life he leads, as by the ſound and <hi>orthodox</hi> Doctrine he delivers
from the Pulpit, and he does this with the moſt chearful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
that can be, and totally free from the leaſt Shadow of
<hi>Oſtentation</hi>; we attend him every Morning to public Prayers in the
Church.</p>
            <p>Now, my good Friend, I have given you a very particular Account of
my preſent Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and leave it to you to judge, if it is not very
agreeable. I muſt add to this, that I got here Time enough for the Races,
where there was a great Appearance of Company, (for ſuch a Place;) though Men
were ſcarce, I got a Partner each Night. Lord STAMFORD's Family were the
firſt in Rank. Lady MARY GREY opened the Ball, and I had the Honour to dance
a Minuet with Mr. GREY, the firſt Night: indeed, I have met with ſo much
Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Goodneſs from every Body in this Part of the World, that I
am ſure I ſhall be grieved to leave <hi>Bridgenorth.</hi> My firſt

            <p>The 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Sweet winding Tay,</hi>"</q> which runs at the
Bottom of our Garden, for upwards of ſix Miles, forms the moſt beautiful
Canal you can imagine; on the one Side of it, for the ſame Extent, are
delightful Walks, riſing one above another, no leſs than five Stages, all
amply ſhaded with ſtately Trees, from around whoſe Trunks the twining
Woodbine and Sweet-Briar pours forth a Profuſion of Sweets; the ſloping
Sides of the Walks are alſo planted with Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſweet-ſmelling
Shrubs, which being fanned by the freſh Breezes off the River, 
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:1173200202:325"/> ſcatter Perfumes in a plenteous and grateful Return,
along the verdant Banks. At judicious Diſtances are placed graſſy Seats,
moſs-grown Cells, and flowery Arbours, all which, in their ſeveral Turns,
would invite us to ſit down and indulge Contemplation, but that the
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied Mind, enraptured with theſe enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Objects, urges us to
proceed in Search of new Beauties, and in that Purſuit it cannot here meet
with the ſlighteſt Diſappointment. The oppoſite Side of the River is a
deep Bank, finely fringed with Wood of a younger Growth; at different Points of
View, we ſee the <hi>Brawn,</hi> another beautiful River, and a foaming
Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade; each paying the Tribute of their lucid Stores into the cryſtal
Boſom of the <hi>Tay,</hi> who, as if conſcious of ſuperior Merit, trips
nimbly along, in Murmurs of Self-Applauſe. This charming Proſpect is at
laſt cloſed with Views of diſtant Ruins, Hills covered with Trees,
fertile Vales, and Mountains of a moſt vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Appearance, covered with a
Heath ſo beautiful, that it may vie with the glowing Amaranthus. The Gardens
are very extenſive, and laid out in the fineſt Taſte, that is to ſay,
with Grandeur and Simplicity united. <pb n="317" facs="tcp:1173200202:326"/> Nature appears here
in her lovelieſt Attire, and Art is contented to act in her proper Sphere, as
Handmaid to the Goddeſs. We ſeldom drink Tea in the Houſe; ſometimes an
elegant Tent and <hi>Marquis</hi> is pitched at ſome fine Point of View;
ſometimes we reſort to a fine banqueting Room, and often the Shade of a
large ſpreading Oak has the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. Upon theſe Occaſions the Duke
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reads and we work. What moſt attracts my Admiration here is, to
perceive that in every ſurrounding Object, Utility adds Merit to Beauty: the
Farm-Houſes on this Eſtate are neat as the Hand of Induſtry can make
them, and chearful as the Smiles of Content; and every Creature that breathes
upon this Spot ſeems to participate in the unfeigned Happineſs of the
excellent Poſſeſſors, whoſe Goodneſs adds the higheſt Luſtre to
Wealth and Title that they are capable of receiving. It was well ſaid,
whoever made the Obſervation, that a good Action never loſes its reward;
here was I ſat down, full of Love and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to write my deareſt
Friends a dutiful and loving Letter, when lo, and behold! I was made happy by
the Receipt of yours; and <pb n="318" facs="tcp:1173200202:327"/> truly rejoiced I am to find,
that my Fears are groundleſs; however, I don't feel happy at the Thought of
our Society's meeting with any Interruption to its Pleaſures. Believe my
Aſſurance ſincere, when I affirm, that I think the <hi>Content</hi> which
reigns therein, far excels in Value the higheſt Gratifications that Shew and
Grandeur can beſtow on its reſtleſs Votaries. Pray have you ever read DE
TOUCHE's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies? I am poſitive ſuch excellent Subjects, modelled for our
Stage, would be of public Emolument, and I ſhould hope, would be productive
of both Honour and Profit to the Undertaker. I am afraid, by what you ſay of
<hi>Dunkeld,</hi> I gave you an Account of its Beauties in my laſt, if ſo,
this will be a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, ſtupid Repetition; in that Caſe, commit me to the
Flames without the leaſt Remorſe of Conſcience. I hope the Sight of a
Letter directed by the Pen of a fine young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, won't give you any
Alarm; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it has done ſo by me, ſince this new faſhioned Way of
franking. Adieu! In more Haſte than can be expreſſed, believe me ever</p>

            <p>HOW ſtrong and wonderful, my good Friend, is the Force of Habit! I
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, near upon my Departure from the dear Society in
<hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> I felt an auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Kind of—I don't know
what—when it was propoſed that I ſhould maintain a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Correſpondence with <hi>one of the other Sex,</hi> during my Abſence. I
felt this, even in ſpite of the Conviction, that writing to <hi>you,</hi>
was, in fact, but writing to the <hi>whole Circle.</hi> How idle!—Now
that I have done ſo, for ſome Time, I have taught myſelf to addreſs
you, with as little Reſerve, as if you were my <hi>real,</hi> inſtead of my
<hi>nominal</hi> Uncle. So much the better—Reſerve was not made for
true Friendſhip, and liberal Minds, and with none but ſuch do I
correſpond.—So much by Way of Digreſſion; now, to return to my
little Travels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:1173200202:329"/>We have been theſe ſix Weeks paſt at
<hi>Atholl</hi> Houſe, a very magnificent Seat of the Duke's, twenty Miles
higher up in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands than this Place is; though it far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<hi>Dunkeld</hi> in Grandeur, yet I own the rural Beauties of the latter, have
more Charms for my humble Diſpoſition; Providence ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, no doubt,
deſigned me to tread the 
<q rend="inline">"Cool ſequeſtered Vale of Life,"</q> has bounded
my Ideas accordingly, and I look upon this as one of the numberleſs
Inſtances I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced of the Divine Bounty. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try about
<hi>Atholl</hi> is very romantic and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; in ſome Places rather wild,
in others very fertile, which forms a fine Contraſt. The Houſe is
immenſely large, the Rooms are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in Number, finely proportioned, and
elegantly furniſhed throughout; 'tis ſituated in a very extenſive Vale,
amply wooded, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namented with four beautiful Rivers, all of which, at
different Places, loſe themſelves in the <hi>Tay.</hi> Some of them from
the Tops of very high Mountains receive a prodigious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe from the
fineſt natural Caſcades you can imagine, which is a Sight extremely
beautiful, <pb n="321" facs="tcp:1173200202:330"/> and at the ſame Time very tremendous. The
Kitchen-Garden is the fineſt Thing of the Kind that in my Life I ever ſaw;
elegant Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-houſes, Alcoves, Octagons, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> often
tempted us to drink Tea abroad, and enjoy the fine extenſive Views at
Leiſure. I ſhould have told you, that the Vale is ſurrounded with Hills
and Mountains, at ſuch a Diſtance, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of confining the
Proſpect, they add great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Grandeur of it.</p>
            <p>I muſt not omit to mention a natural Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity I here met with,
of a very extraordinary Kind: M' PHERSON, Laird of <hi>Foignes,</hi> two Years
before the Peace, raiſed eight and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Men to ſerve in
<hi>America</hi>; who unanimouſly declared when they came to embark, that
they would not have enliſted, had they not thought they ſhould have
ſerved under <hi>him</hi>; the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Laird was ſo ſtruck with this
Proof of their Attachment, that he declared they ſhould not be
diſappointed, and, at the Age of ſeventy-two, aſked Leave to ſerve as a
Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteer; during the Remainder of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign he was preſent in every
Action, was always ready to expoſe his Perſon, and never 
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:1173200202:331"/> was a ſingle Day prevented by Illneſs from doing his
Duty; the Government has reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſpirited Generoſity with a
<hi>Lieutenancy,</hi> and Leave to retire upon full Pay, ſo that now, like
the Patriarchs of old, he wages more harmleſs Wars with the feathered Race
and ſwift-footed Stag: now, at near fourſcore Years of Age, he is able to
walk and ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble amongſt the Mountains, the whole Day, in Purſuit of
Game. How few, my good Friend, of our degenerate Countrymen, are at ſuch an
Age able to ſerve their King and Country! Enervated by Sloth and Luxury, long
before that Period of Life, they become a Burthen to themſelves, and a
Torment to all about them. When I looked at the military Garb and venerable
ſilver Locks of this northern Hero, I fancied I ſaw in his ſingle
Perſon an Epitome of all the illuſtrious <hi>Greeks</hi> that ſerved in
the Siege of <hi>Troy</hi>; and if my Heart had been inclined to change its
preſent Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I verily believe I ſhould without Heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation have
beſtowed it upon this warlike Mountaineer.</p>
            <p>I fear the Seaſon is now approaching, when our friendly
Aſſociation muſt loſe ſome of its <pb n="323" facs="tcp:1173200202:332"/> agreeable
Ornaments; I feel for the Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation a <hi>ſenſible</hi> Mind muſt
ſuffer, at being obliged to quit the Society of a favourite <hi>few,</hi> to
mix with the unthinking many: but hope that the kind Genius of Friendſhip
will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Gleam of Pleaſure, at the Proſpect of a future
Meeting.</p>
            <p>My Love to all, you know, is a conſtant Commiſſion, and I am
ſure you will never forget to diſcharge it. How is that beſt of good
Beings, our Preſident, our Patroneſs, our Life, our Spirit, our all? Is
ſhe not the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt of Heaven's Worthies? Was there ever Acquaintance
who did not eſteem her, Friend who did not love her, Domeſtic who did not
bleſs her, or Indigent, who came to her Door, that did not pray for her? Long
may ſhe remain with us! and whenever it pleaſes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to remove her
from Earth, may ſhe receive Bleſſings in a future State, in as ample
Portions, as ſhe, through Life, has ever wiſhed and endeavoured to
diſpenſe them to her Fellow-Creatures.</p>

            <p>DID you ever expect to hear of, or from me again? Ever ſince I
received your laſt, I have lived the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ife of a Whirlagig, but be
aſſured that I had not a Moment to tell you ſo. The dear Spot I left was
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in my Thoughts, and indeed as yet my poor Brain is far from being in a
compoſed State; a ſcribbling Moment too is the only good Thing that is
ſcarce here. A few Days after I received yours we left the calm Sweets of
<hi>Dunkeld,</hi> and went to pay a ſecond Viſit at Lord BREADALBANE's,
where all was Mirth, Muſic, Maſquerades, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> From
thence we ſet forth on our Return towards a ſouthern Sun, and gentler
Breezes, and ſtopped for a few Days at the elegant and ſuperb Seat of Lord
BINGLEY, near <hi>York</hi>; there we found a brilliant Aſſembly of Ladies
and Gentlemen, <pb n="325" facs="tcp:1173200202:334"/> who had met to dine and play Cards,
how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, moſt of them went away in the Evening, and we remained a decent
Party for the reſt of the Time; from thence we bent our Courſe to this
magnificent Caſtle, hoping, wiſhing, and expecting, to find a quiet,
peaceable Family till <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> when we knew a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Riot was
always intended; but lo, and behold! here we found his Highneſs of
<hi>York,</hi> Lord and Lady CHARLES SPENCER, Lady CHATHERINE, and Mr.
BEAUCLERK, Lord and Lady LUDLOW, and a World more of fine Folks; the very
firſt Night we were forced to join in a Ball, and every Day, whilſt his
Highneſs ſtayed, we had Muſic in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Cards or Dancing at
Night; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every Creature was fatigued with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and I can
anſwer for one who was glad when it was over; the Duke of YORK was ſo
pleaſed with his Entertainment, that it is not impoſſible but he may
return at <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi> We are now a ſober decent Party of ten or
twelve, and, like rational Beings, read and work in the Evenings; and, to
ſhew you that all this Diſſipation does not totally baniſh ſerious
Thoughts, we have Prayers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly <pb n="326" facs="tcp:1173200202:335"/> every Morning in
a beautiful Chapel in the Caſtle. I take it for granted, that you know, all
this Time, that the Owner of this Palace is the Duke of MANCHESTER, who is a
very amiable young Nobleman, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lord CHARLES MONTAGU, is no leſs
ſo, the Ducheſs is beautiful, polite, and a very good young Woman; but the
Character that I could dwell upon with Delight for Ages, is Lady CAROLINE
MONTAGU, the Duke's Siſter. If ever perfect Goodneſs choſe to dwell with
mere Mortality, one may imagine it inhabits her Breaſt; and I flatter
myſelf, that you will not conceive the worſe Idea of her Ladyſhip, when I
tell you, that ſhe honours me with a very particular Friendſhip, unworthy
as I am of ſuch a valuable Diſtinction. Don't think I flatter, for I am
perfectly ſincere, when I aſſure you, that I often think, amidſt this
perpetual Round of gay Amuſements, with infinite Regret of the dear
<hi>ſocial Party,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I have ſpent ſome of the happieſt and
moſt rational Moments of my Life; I gave ſuch a Picture of it to a young
Man of <hi>great Quality</hi> and <hi>good Senſe,</hi> a little while ago,
that he made me paſs my Word, if ever we met <pb n="327" facs="tcp:1173200202:336"/> at
—, to introduce him to the Lady Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troneſs of the agreeable
<hi>Society.</hi> I beg my beſt Affections to all the dear Aſſociates; I
rejoice, without the leaſt Mixture of Envy, at my worthy Nameſake's happy
Proſpects, and ſincerely wiſh ſhe may enjoy every Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city the
<hi>holy Eſtate</hi> can poſſibly produce. I hope I need not ſay, that
a Letter from you always gives me Pleaſure; you will, I am ſure, indulge me
between this and <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi> Pray tell me, in your next, if Mr. QUIN
is not alive; beſides the Concern I ſhould feel for his Death, I am engaged
in a Wager about it.</p>
            <p>I am become ſuch a wandering Vagabond over the Face of the Earth,
that I ſhould not be a Bit ſurpriſed to find myſelf conveyed ſuddenly
to the utmoſt Extent of the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Globe: I fear, I ſhall be leſs
fortunate than NOAH's Dove; ſhe, at laſt, found Reſt for the Sole of her
Foot, but I doubt I ſhall not, till my Soul has taken its Flight to ſome
more happy Region; I aſſure you I meant no Pun, but I ſee one has fallen
from my Pen of its own Accord. I heard from our <pb n="328" facs="tcp:1173200202:337"/> Friends
in — ſince I got here, and have the Satisfaction to find they are all
well.</p>
            <p>I would attempt to give you ſome Idea of this Place, but there is
a Magnificence and Extenſiveneſs in it, that goes far beyond the Capacity
of my Pen. The Caſtle is a very large and regular Building, the
Connoiſſeurs ſay the Architecture is very juſt; 'tis expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
furniſhed, though not in the modern Taſte; there are many good Paintings
that this Duke bought in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Parks, Lawns, <hi>&amp;c.
&amp;c.</hi> are judiciouſly planted, and laid out in a good Taſte; I find
the preſent Poſſeſſor has made many Improvements, and is making
ſtill more. The Plate and Apparatus for the Table is more ſuperb than any
Thing of the Kind that I have ever ſeen, and the Table is always elegantly
covered; but I muſt confeſs, this is the Kind of Luxury that pleaſes me
the leaſt, and I often think, how much more healthy, and conſequently
happier, our Forefathers were, than their degenerate Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who live upon
<hi>Ragouts, Fricaſſes,</hi> and high-ſeaſoned Meats.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:1173200202:338"/>Adieu! If you are tired with my moralizing,

            </opener>
            <p>I NOW write to you from this Metropolis of <hi>Dirt</hi> and
<hi>Gentility,</hi> which, owing to the Narrowneſs of the Streets and Height
of the Houſes, puts me more in mind of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of <hi>North</hi> than of
<hi>South Britain</hi>; but then the <hi>Grands Hotels</hi> are more noble, and
in greater Abundance than our Noblemen's Houſes; and the Environs of
<hi>Paris</hi> are, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, finer than thoſe of <hi>London,</hi>
which Place <pb n="330" facs="tcp:1173200202:339"/> we left on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 17th of
this Month, and arrived here on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 22d, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meeting
any diſagreeable Accident during the Journey. We have got a very elegant
Apartment in one of the beſt Parts of <hi>Paris,</hi> and, you may be ſure,
have loſt no Time ſince our Arrival, in ſeeing every Thing that is worthy
a Stranger's Curioſity. The <hi>Thuilleries,</hi> of which <hi>French</hi>
Novelliſts make ſuch frequent Mention, is a pleaſant Place for the People
of Faſhion to take the Air in. The <hi>Louvre,</hi> which, in outward Shew,
far exceeds any Palace we have, runs along one End of it, and on the oppoſite
Side a fine Square is building, called the <hi>Place de Louis Quinze</hi>;
there are noble ſhady Walks, and a charming Terraſs, that commands a fine
View of <hi>Paris</hi>; but the old Taſte, in which the Center of the Garden
is laid out, is frightful, and exactly reſembles the Ornaments of a
Minced-Pye. There is another faſhionable Rendezvous for the Evening Airings,
about a Mile out of <hi>Paris,</hi> that, I confeſs, pleaſes me ſtill
more, called the <hi>Bois de Bullogne,</hi> where, inſtead of a ſharp
Gravel and crowded Walks, like our Park, you may wander about 
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:1173200202:340"/> at full Liberty, and tread upon a verdant Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet all
the Time, which to tender-footed Folks makes a great Difference. We have ſeen
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral private Collections of Paintings, and other Curioſities, that do
great Honour to the Taſte and Judgment of the Poſſeſſors: but nothing
charms me ſo much, as a noble Collection of Pictures at the <hi>Palais
Royale,</hi> which belongs to the Duke of ORLEANS, firſt Prince of the Blood,
and were chiefly purchaſed by the famous Regent. The grand Opera here is the
fineſt Thing to ſee one can poſſibly imagine; the Scenes are
ſplendid, the Dreſſes rich and elegant, the Dances compoſed with
infinite Taſte, and finely executed, and the Stage much better filled than
ours: but the Muſic is truly deteſtable; 'tis all <hi>French,</hi> and from
the Beginning to the End like a ſolemn Dirge. As for the Voices, if you will
imagine a Concert compoſed of Cats, Owls, and Monkeys, it will give you a
tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Idea of the Harmony, and whoever aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinates your Ears
with the greateſt Violence is moſt applauded. The <hi>French</hi> comic
Opera is as agreeable as the ſerious one is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. The Songs are all
ſprightly <hi>Italian</hi> 
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:1173200202:341"/> Airs; the Scenery and
Dreſſes, as at the other, excel ours, and to my Fancy, this is the moſt
agreeable Amuſement <hi>Paris</hi> affords; their Manner of acting Plays, I
own, does not charm me, after being uſed to the genteel, familiar Dialogue of
our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Comedies; and even in Tragedy, I think they have too
much Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, both of Voice and Action. I ſhould not thus familiarly play the
Critic, were I not perfectly well acquainted with your Candour and Good-nature;
for, after all, I am talking of what I don't underſtand, and am as likely to
be wrong as right. So much by Way of Digreſſion, a Liberty all modern
Novelliſts allow themſelves; and now my Narrative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the Chapter
of Faſhions, for the Sake of the female Members of your Party. The Ladies in
general would, I believe, be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but for two ſhocking Dabs of
Crimſon, or Scarlet, which ſome prefer, in a circular Form, directly under
each Eye, which makes them look juſt like ſo many Furies; the Hair
dreſſed out of all Proportion, for often the Height of the Hair is more a
great Deal than the Length of the whole Face; even <hi>I,</hi> who am quite
moderate, am at leaſt three Inches <pb n="333" facs="tcp:1173200202:342"/> of
<hi>Toupée</hi> taller than I was when I left <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; the
Hoops are very ſmall, the Ruffles very moderate, and the Necks more covered
than in <hi>England</hi>; the Gowns are made very high behind, and pin pretty
cloſe before, and almoſt as wide at Bottom as at Top; the Pleats of the
Sacks behind are made narrower than ours. The married Ladies (indeed we never
ſee any other in public) all wear very ſmall Caps. The Court being in
Mourning, prevents our ſeeing any other finery than Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, in which the
Ladies ſeem to abound, in general, more than in <hi>England.</hi> Not a Head
of any Sort have I yet ſeen that is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely plaiſtered with
Pomatum and Powder, thoſe of the Poor as well as the Rich; I wonder the
Conſumption of Flower in this Metropolis of well-dreſſed dirty People,
does not breed a Famine: the Streets are always ſo crowded with them, that
you would ſwear <hi>Paris</hi> was the moſt populous Place, and the
<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſians</hi> the moſt idle Set of People, in the whole World. A
faſhionable Cuſtom here is, when the Comedy is finiſhed, to drive to what
is called the <hi>Grande Boule Vert,</hi> one Side of which is ſhaded with
Trees, and the other filled with <pb n="334" facs="tcp:1173200202:343"/> large Coffee-houſes,
finely illuminated, where you ſee all Manner of Sport going forward, as
Eating, Dancing, Muſic, Puppet-Shows, Conjurers, Fireworks, Fire-Eaters,
Giants, Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liputians, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> in ſhort, you may be
amuſed, in about the Length of the Mall, from eight in the Evening till three
in the Morning; but the genteel Way is only to drive up and down the Walk
without getting out of your Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. I am afraid that my Deſcription of
<hi>Paris,</hi> and its Amuſements, will tire both your Eyes and your
Patience, at leaſt, it has done ſo by me, and I have ſcribbled in ſuch
a Hurry, that it is not fit to ſend; but I flatter myſelf, you would rather
have a Letter ill written, than none; I am mortified though, that it will
coſt you a great deal more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtage than it is worth, and by the Time it
reaches you, we ſhall probably be purſuing our Journey, ſo that I cannot
hope to hear a Word of or from our dear Society till I get to <hi>Venice.</hi>
In the mean Time, I beg to be remembered in the kindeſt Manner, to every
Member, and that you will believe me to be, as I ever am, with Truth and
Sincerity, yours and the Society's truly affectionate and obliged</p>

               <p>I hope you are able to enjoy this charming Weather, (for I hope
'tis ſuch with you as well as with us) by taking many agreeable Walks in your
delightful Meads. I aſſure you the <hi>Seine</hi> is nothing comparable to
the <hi>Avon,</hi> and the <hi>Pont Neuf,</hi> ſo much extolled by
<hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> is a paltry Affair, in Compariſon of

               <p>I was ſo charmed, and ſo moved laſt Night at the Tragedy of

               <salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE greateſt Pleaſure I can feel during my Exile is to hear good
Accounts fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of thoſe Friends in <hi>England</hi> that are moſt
dear to me. I hope you will anſwer this very ſoon, and be ſo good as to
direct your Letter to me as uſual, under Cover to Mr. —, who has the
Care of ſending our Letters to the Secretary of State's Office, by which
Means I receive my Letters much ſafer, than when they are not put in the
Packet. It is not yet quite three Months ſince I left <hi>England,</hi> and I
declare it appears to me three Years already; we were ſo fortunate, as to
perform our Journey without one unlucky Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. On the twentieth of
<hi>July,</hi> of all Days in the Year, we began our Peregrinations, and
arrived here on the twentieth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> after ſtopping about five
Days on the Road, to <pb n="337" facs="tcp:1173200202:346"/> ſee different Places that were
worthy of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. We made no ſmall Figure, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, at
ſetting out; our Train conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of two Poſt-Coaches and two
Poſt-Chaiſes: to our no ſmall Amuſement, we were miſtaken for
Foreigners all the Way to <hi>Dover,</hi> which, I ſuppoſe, was owing to
our wearing large <hi>French</hi> Caps without Hats, and our Gentlemen being
dreſſed in looſe <hi>French</hi> Coats, which are the moſt convenient
Kind of Dreſs for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling. We were not quite three Hours croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Water; the Quickneſs of the Paſſage ſcarcely made up for the
Roughneſs of it, which was really frightful, even to me, who am no
deſpicable Sailor for a <hi>Female</hi> In ſhort, I was the only Perſon
well enough to nurſe, which was very neceſſary for the other Females in
our Party. At <hi>Calais</hi> we found two excellent Berlins waiting to conduct
us to <hi>Straſbourg,</hi> in which we proceeded with our two
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Chaiſes. Our Route was quite different from that by which
we once went from <hi>Straſbourg</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> to my no ſmall
Joy, for I think a twice-gone Road almoſt as bad as a twice-told Tale. I had
an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, by this Means, of ſeeing Beauties in <pb n="338" facs="tcp:1173200202:347"/>
               <hi>Champaigne,</hi> which, till then, I had no Idea of; for many Miles the
Road formed an actual Terraſs, bounded on one Side by little Hills,
interſperſed with Vineyards and Corn Fields, and on the other Side, the Eye
is led, by a gentle Deſcent, down to the moſt fertile Vales, the Verdure of
which could ſcarcely be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Painting of paſtoral Poetry;
through theſe, for an immenſe Way, meanders a moſt beautiful ſerpentine
River, whoſe Banks are adorned with innumerable Droves of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of every
Sort, which puts one in Mind of the peaceful Reign of the Patriarchs, ſince,
being undivided, they appear to be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of <hi>one</hi> Maſter. You
will ſcarcely think, my good Friend, that theſe ſmiling Scenes could
raiſe melancholy Ideas, and yet they had that Effect upon my Mind; in
almoſt every Village we paſſed through, which had looked beautiful at a
Diſtance, we found all the Appearance of Wretchedneſs and Want that you
ſee in the moſt dreary Parts of <hi>Savoy,</hi> for what the Extravagance
and Luxury of the Prince of CONDE (part of whoſe immenſe Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory this
is) leaves to the Peaſants, is wrecked from them by the lazy Prieſts, who,
like Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts, <pb n="339" facs="tcp:1173200202:348"/> ſeem to be ſent only to eat up the
Riches of the Land; here you ſee no hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Gentleman's Seat; no warm,
neat Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; thoſe are Comforts reſerved only for the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> who would, perhaps, be more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Bleſſings
they enjoy, if they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed fewer of them. But to return to our
Journey; the fine Seaſon of the Year, good Roads, and every where tolerable
Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, carried us in twelve Days to <hi>Straſbourg,</hi> where we
ſtopped for three Days, and where you may, if you pleaſe, ſuppoſe we
ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main till you hear from me next, as I ſhall defer the Reſt of my
Account of our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for a future Letter.</p>
            <p>The Maſking is juſt begun, and two comic Operas, and two
Play-Houſes opened; I have been once at the Opera, and caught ſuch a Cold,
(partly, I ſuppoſe, a Tribute to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Year, and partly to
Change of Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate) that, for fear of the like Accident, I ſhall frequent
Theatres very little, unleſs I am tempted by a Party.</p>
            <p>

            <p>I am juſt in the diſagreeable Situation I was this Time two

            <p>I Received with infinite Pleaſure, my dear Friends, your very kind
Letter; the good Account you give of yourſelves is really and truly a
<hi>Happineſs</hi> to me, and you have my ſincere Prayers and good
Wiſhes, that your Health and Spirits may daily improve. I make no Doubt, but
your Tour was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful one: there is about you, our ſweet Patroneſs, a
certain Chearfulneſs and Good-humour that proceeds immediately from the
Heart, that not only illuminates her own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but inſpires
thoſe about her with the moſt pleaſing Senſations the human Mind is
capable of feeling. I beg of you to preſent my beſt Affections to the
Doctor and Mrs. W—, and aſſure them, that I take the ſincereſt
Part in their Affliction; my good <hi>Papa</hi>'s filial Piety always appeared
to me a <pb n="342" facs="tcp:1173200202:351"/> ſhining Part of his Character—my Love
and ſincere good Wiſhes attend every Member of the <hi>dear Society</hi>;
would to God I could ſay, I had any Proſpect of being ſoon re-united to
that beſt of all poſſible Societies: but, alas! that is not to be hoped
for: what <hi>muſt be, muſt be,</hi> and I make no Doubt 'tis right.</p>
            <p>Now, my dear Friend, I muſt beg of you to take a Step back with me
to <hi>Straſbourg,</hi> for there, I think, we parted laſt; from thence we
ſteered our Courſe to <hi>Ball,</hi> (or <hi>Bazill,</hi> as it is called
in the Maps) in <hi>Switzerland.</hi> This Change in our Route delighted me,.
We were induced to make this little Round, to avoid a great Part of
<hi>Swabia,</hi> where we heard the Roads were almoſt impaſſable, the
Water un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome, a great Scarcity of Proviſions, and the Meaſles raging
every where; <hi>Ball</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well worth the Obſervation of
Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; the Situation is on a very noble Part of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which
runs through the Town; it alſo merits the Attention of the Lovers of
<hi>Virtù,</hi> as the beſt Relict of the famous HOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BENS (known by
the Name of <hi>Death's Dance)</hi> is preſerved in the public Library. From
<hi>Ball</hi> 
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:1173200202:352"/> we proceeded to <hi>Schafhauſen,</hi>
another of the proteſtant <hi>Swiſs</hi> Cantons; about three Miles hence
is the Cataract of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which I contemplated with a
Mixture of <hi>Horror</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> eaſier to be felt than
deſcribed, which I beg you will tell my <hi>Papa</hi> conveyed to me a
clearer Idea of the <hi>Sublime and Beautiful,</hi> than I could ever gather
even from Mr. BURKE. We next travelled a very pleaſant Road, and caught many
fine Views of the famous Lake <hi>de Conſtance:</hi> but upon the whole,
though I like <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> well enough, <hi>en-paſſant,</hi>
there is an unpoliſhed melancholy Air, even in the greateſt Towns, that is
diſguſting. When we got into the <hi>Tyrrol,</hi> every Thing loſt the
Charm of Novelty to me, and I had only the mortifying Reflection to make, that
when I laſt paſſed thoſe rugged Paths, I was going towards
<hi>England,</hi> and now, alas! was going from it. As we met with no
Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures new or ſurpriſing, I will trouble you with no further
Particulars of our Journey, ſave that we arrived at <hi>Venice</hi> the
twentieth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> after being exactly a Month on the Road,
without meeting with one Overturn, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <pb n="344" facs="tcp:1173200202:353"/> Axeltree, or
other ſiniſter Accident what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>And now let me ſay a few Words for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, independent of
Company. Since the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſixth of <hi>December,</hi> every Creature here,
that has Spirits enough to be ſo, has appeared quite mad; indeed,
<hi>Venice</hi> (in Carnival-Time eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) is only fit for thoſe who
can place their Happineſs in <hi>Vice, Folly,</hi> and
<hi>Diſſipation</hi>; indeed, I am not only a profeſſed, but a
ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Enemy to theſe three: you will believe me, when I tell you, that I
am horridly out of my Element here, and I feel the greateſt Conviction, that
I ſhall never taſte a hearty Satisfaction, till I again enjoy our rational,
dear friendly Society; but I fear the Time is very far diſtant when I ſhall
be allowed to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of ſuch enviable Amuſements. You know I mean, in
this Declaration, only to refer to the Cuſtoms of the Place, not to the Party
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I came, which is indiſputably as rational and amiable as
<hi>can</hi> be enjoyed, uninterrupted with Hurry of <hi>Place</hi> and
ceremonial Viſitors. I believe you have often heard me mention a Mrs.
S—, a very particular Friend of mine, <pb n="345" facs="tcp:1173200202:354"/> who has been
ſettled here many Years, and now, having loſt a Huſband in his
ninety-ninth or hundredth Year, ſhe is preparing to return to
<hi>England</hi>; we have talked ſo much and ſo often of you all, that
ſhe is perſuaded ſhe is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with you, and begs me to give her
Compliments to you; and I verily believe, ſhe will be tempted when ſhe
arrives, to make you a friendly Viſit.</p>
            <p>I am aſhamed to ſend you ſuch a horrid Scrawl, but I have
wrote it by Snatches, with moſt vile Implements; the Date will faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſhew you it was begun on the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſixth of <hi>January,</hi> and now I am
concluding it on the ninth of <hi>February,</hi> ſo that you may be
aſſured, though I <hi>ſeem</hi> dilatory in writing, I, by no Means,
intend to <hi>be</hi> ſo. I was in Hopes to have popped this into a
Diſpatch: but, alas! they are grown ſcarce Commodities at our Houſe.</p>
            <p>We have no leſs than three Operas and four Play Houſes open;
and, would you believe it! I am grown ſo <hi>old</hi> or ſo
<hi>ſtupid,</hi> that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Book or a Pen by the Fire-Side, to 
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:1173200202:355"/> any of them. I am much abuſed for this Want of
Taſte; but ſo hardened a Sinner am I, that it grows every Day ſtronger on
me. Adieu, my dear good Friend; may every Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity and Bleſſing attend you
all! Such is the ſincere Prayer of your ever</p>
