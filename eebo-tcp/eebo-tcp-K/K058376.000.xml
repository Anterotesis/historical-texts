            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS Preface comes Directed to you, not as Commiſſioner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under whom I have the Honour to ſerve his Majeſty; nor as a Friend; though I have great Obligations of that ſort alſo; but as the moſt proper Judge of the Subjects Treated of, and more Capable than the greateſt part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to Diſtinguiſh and Underſtand them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Books</hi> are uſeful only to ſuch whoſe Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us are ſuitable to the Subject of them: And to
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0411500300:3"/>
Dedicate a Book of Projects to a Perſon who had never concern'd himſelf to Think that way, would be like Muſick to one that has no Ear.</p>
            <p>And yet Your having a Capacity to Judge of theſe things, no way brings You under the Deſpicable Title of a <hi>Projector,</hi> any more than knowing the Practices and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties of Wicked Men, makes a Man guilty of their Crimes.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral Chapters of this Book, are the reſults of particular Thoughts, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by Converſing with the Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs during the preſent War with <hi>France.</hi> The Loſſes and Caſualties which attend all Trading Nations in the World, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in ſo Cruel a War as this, have reach'd us all, and I am none of the leaſt Sufferers; if this has put me, as well as others, on Inventions and Projects, ſo much the Subject of this Book, 'tis no more than a proof of the Reaſon I give for the general Projecting Humour of the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0411500300:4"/>
One unhappineſs I lie under in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Book, <hi>viz.</hi> That having kept the greateſt Part of it by me for near Five Years, ſeveral of the Thoughts ſeem to be hit by other Hands, and ſome by the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; which turns the tables upon me, as if I had Borrow'd from them.</p>
            <p>As particularly that of the Seamen, which you know well I had contriv'd long before the Act for Regiſtring Seamen was Propos'd. And that of Educating Women, which I think my ſelf bound to Declare, was form'd long before the Book call'd <hi>Advice to the Ladies,</hi> was made Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and yet I do not Write this to Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify my own Invention, but to acquit my ſelf from Grafting on other People's Thoughts. If I have Treſpaſs'd upon any Perſon in the World, 'tis upon Your ſelf, from whom I had ſome of the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about County Banks, and Factories for Goods, in the Chapter of Banks; and yet I do not think that my Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0411500300:5"/>
for the Women, or the Seamen, claſhes at all, either with that Book, on the Publick method of Regiſtring Seamen.</p>
            <p>I have been told ſince this was done, That my Propoſal for a <hi>Commiſſion of Enquiries into Bankrupt Eſtates,</hi> is Borrow'd from the <hi>Dutch;</hi> if there is any thing like it among the <hi>Dutch,</hi> 'tis more than ever I knew, or know yet; but if ſo, I hope 'tis no Objection againſt our having the ſame here, eſpecially if it be true, that 'twou'd be ſo publickly Beneficial as is expreſs'd.</p>
            <p>What is ſaid of <hi>Friendly Societies,</hi> I think no Man will Diſpute with me, ſince one has met with ſo much Succeſs already in the Practice of it, I mean, <hi>The Friendly Society for Widows,</hi> of which you have been pleas'd to be a Governor.</p>
            <p>Friendly Societies are very extenſive, and as I have hinted, might be carri'd on to many Particulars. I have omitted one which was mention'd in Diſcourſe
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0411500300:6"/>
with your ſelf; where a Hundred Tradeſmen, all of ſeveral Trades, Agree together to Buy whatever they want of one another, and no where elſe, <hi>Prices</hi> and <hi>Payments</hi> to be ſettled among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; whereby every Man is ſure to have Ninety nine Cuſtomers, and can never want a Trade: And I cou'd have fill'd up the Book with Inſtances of like nature, but I never deſign'd to tire the Reader with Particulars.</p>
            <p>The Propoſal of the <hi>Penſion-Office</hi> you will ſoon ſee offer'd to the Publick, as an Attempt for the Relief of the Poor; which if it meets with Encouragement, will every way anſwer all the great Things I have ſaid of it.</p>
            <p>I had Wrote a great many Sheets about the Coin, about bringing in Plate to the Mint, and about our Standard; but ſo many great Heads being upon it, with ſome of whom my Opinion does not agree, I wou'd not adventure to appear in Print upon that Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0411500300:7"/>
Ways and Means alſo I have laid by on the ſame ſcore. Only adhering to this one Point, That be it by Taxing the Wares they Sell, be it by Taxing them in Stock, be it by Compoſition, <hi>which, by the way, I believe is the beſt;</hi> be it by what way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Parliament pleaſe, the Retailers are the Men who ſeem to call upon us to be Tax'd; if not by their own extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary good Circumſtances, though that might bear it, yet by the contrary in all other Degrees of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Retailers are the only men who cou'd pay it with leaſt damage, becauſe it is in their power to levy it again upon their Cuſtomers in the Prices of their Goods, and is no more than paying a higher Rent for their Shops.</p>
            <p>The Retailers of Manufactures, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſo far as relates to the Inland Trade, have never been tax'd yet, and their Wealth or Number is not eaſily calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Trade and Land has been handled
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0411500300:8"/>
roughly enough; and theſe are the men who now lye as a Reſerve to carry on the Burthen of the War.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Men, who, were the Land-Tax collected as it ſhou'd be, ought to pay the King more than that whole Bill ever produc'd; and yet theſe are the men who I think I may venture to ſay, do not pay a Twentieth part in that Bill.</p>
            <p>Shou'd the King appoint a Survey over the Aſſeſſors, and Indict all thoſe who were found faulty; allowing a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to any Diſcoverer of an Aſſeſsment made lower than the literal Senſe of the Act implies, What a Regiſter of Frauds and Connivances wou'd be found out!</p>
            <p>In a General Tax, if any ſhou'd be excus'd, it ſhou'd be the Poor, who are not able to pay, or at leaſt are pinch'd in the neceſſary parts of Life by paying: And yet here a poor Labourer who works for Twelve-Pence or Eighteen-Pence a Day, does not
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0411500300:9"/>
drink a Pot of Beer, but pays the King a Tenth part for Exciſe; and really pays more to the King's Taxes in a year, than a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Shopkeeper, who is Alderman of the Town, worth perhaps Two or Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds, brews his own Beer, pays no Exciſe, and in the Land-Tax is rated it may be 100 <hi>l.</hi> and pays 1 <hi>l.</hi> 4 <hi>s. per Annum:</hi> But ought, if the Act were put in due execution, to pay 36 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> to the King.</p>
            <p>If I were to be ask'd how I wou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this? I wou'd anſwer, It ſhou'd be by ſome Method in which every man may be tax'd in the due proportion to his Eſtate, and the Act put in execution, according to the true Intent and Meaning of it; in order to which a <hi>Commiſſion of Aſſeſsment</hi> ſhou'd be granted to Twelve Men, ſuch as His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhou'd be well ſatisfied of, who ſhou'd go through the whole Kingdom, Three in a Body, and ſhou'd make a new Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsment of Perſonal Eſtates, <hi>not to meddle with Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0411500300:10"/>
To theſe Aſſeſſors ſhou'd all the Old Rates, Pariſh-Books, Poor-Rates, and Highway-Rates alſo be delivered; and upon due Enquiry to be made into the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Living, and reputed Wealth of the People, the Stock or Perſonal Eſtate of every man ſhou'd be aſſeſs'd, without Connivance; and he who is reputed to be worth a Thouſand Pound, ſhou'd be tax'd at a Thouſand Pound; and ſo on: And he who was an over-grown Rich Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Twenty or Thirty thouſand Pounds Eſtate, ſhou'd be tax'd ſo, and Plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Plain Dealing be practis'd indifferently throughout the Kingdom; Tradeſmen and Landed men ſhou'd have Neighbours Fare, as we call it; and a Rich Man ſhou'd not be paſs'd by when a Poor Man pays.</p>
            <p>We read of the Inhabitants of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> that they ſuffer'd their City to be loſt, for want of contributing in time for its Defence; and pleaded Poverty to
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0411500300:11"/>
their Generous Emperor, when he went from Houſe to Houſe to perſuade them; and yet when the <hi>Turks</hi> took it, the Prodigious Immenſe Wealth they found in it, made 'em wonder at the ſordid Temper of the Citizens.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> (with due Exceptions to the Parliament, and the Freedom where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they have given to the Publick Charge) is much like <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> we are involv'd in a Dangerous, a Chargeable, but withal a moſt Juſt and Neceſſary War, and the Richeſt and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney'd Men in the Kingdom plead Poverty; and the <hi>French,</hi> or King <hi>James,</hi> or the <hi>Devil</hi> may come for them, if they can but conceal their Eſtates from the Publick Notice, and get the Aſſeſſors to tax them at an Under-Rate.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the men this Commiſſion wou'd diſcover; and here they ſhou'd find men tax'd at 500 <hi>l.</hi> Stock, who are worth 20000 <hi>l.</hi> Here they ſhou'd find a certain Rich Man near <hi>Hackney,</hi> rated to day
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0411500300:12"/>
in the Tax-Book at 1000 <hi>l.</hi> Stock, and to morrow offering 27000 <hi>l.</hi> for an Eſtate.</p>
            <p>Here they ſhou'd find Sir <hi>J— C—</hi> perhaps tax'd to the King at 5000 <hi>l.</hi> ſtock, perhaps not ſo much, whoſe Caſh no man can gueſs at: And multitudes of Inſtances I cou'd give by name, without wrong to the Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>And not to run on in Particulars, I affirm, That in the Land-Tax Ten certain Gentlemen in <hi>London</hi> put together, did not pay for half ſo much Perſonal Eſtate, call'd <hi>Stock,</hi> as the pooreſt of them is reputed really to poſſeſs.</p>
            <p>I do not enquire at whoſe door this Fraud muſt lye, 'tis none of my buſineſs.</p>
            <p>I wiſh they wou'd ſearch into it, whoſe Power can puniſh it. But this with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion I preſume to ſay;</p>
            <p>The King is thereby defrauded and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly abus'd; the true Intent and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Acts of Parliament evaded; the Nation involv'd in Debt by fatal Deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0411500300:13"/>
and Intereſts; Fellow-Subjects abus'd, and new Inventions for Taxes occaſion'd.</p>
            <p>The laſt Chapter in this Book is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal about entring all the Seamen in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> into the King's Pay; a Subject which deſerves to be enlarg'd into a Book it ſelf; and I have a little Volume of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations and Particulars by me on that Head, but I thought them too long to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. In ſhort, I am perſuaded, was that Method propos'd to thoſe Gentlemen to whom ſuch things belong, the greateſt Sum of Money might be rais'd by it, with the leaſt Injury to thoſe who pay it, that ever was or will be during the War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Projectors,</hi> they ſay, are generally to be taken with allowance of one half at leaſt; they always have their mouths full of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, and talk big of their own Propoſals; and therefore I have not expos'd the vaſt Sums my Calculations amount to, but I venture to ſay I could procure a Farm on ſuch a Propoſal as this at Three Millions <hi>per Ann.</hi>
               <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0411500300:14"/>
and give very good Security for Payment; ſuch an Opinion I have of the Value of ſuch a Method; and when that is done, the Nation wou'd get Three more by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; which is very ſtrange, but might eaſily be made out.</p>
            <p>In the Chapter of Academies, I have ventur'd to reprove the Vicious Cuſtom of Swearing: I ſhall make no Apology for the Fact; for no man ought to be aſham'd of expoſing what all men ought to be aſham'd of practiſing: But methinks I ſtand cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by my own Laws a little, in forcing the Reader to repeat ſome of the worſt of our Vulgar Imprecations, in reading my Thoughts againſt it: To which, however, I have this to reply;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I did not find it eaſy to expreſs what I mean, without putting down the very Words, at leaſt not ſo as to be very Intelligible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Why ſhould Words repeated only to expoſe the Vice, taint the Reader,
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0411500300:15"/>
more than a Sermon preach'd againſt Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould the Aſſembly; for of neceſſity it leads the Hearer to the Thoughts of the Fact; but the Morality of every Action lies in the End; and if the Reader by ill uſe renders himſelf guilty of the Fact in Reading, which I deſign'd to expoſe by Writing, the Fault is his, not mine.</p>
            <p>I have endeavour'd every where in this Book to be as Conciſe as poſſible, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept where Calculations oblig'd me to be particular; and having avoided Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in the <hi>Book,</hi> I wou'd avoid it too in the <hi>Preface;</hi> and therefore ſhall break off with ſubſcribing my ſelf,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Eceſſity, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Invention, has ſo violently agitated the Wits of men at this time, that it ſeems not at all improper, by way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, to call it, <hi>The Projecting Age.</hi> For tho' in times of War and Publick Confuſions, the like Humour of Invention has ſeem'd to ſtir; yet, without being partial to the preſent, it is, I think, no Injury to ſay, the paſt Ages have never come up to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Projecting and Inventing, as it refers to Matters of Negoce, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0411500300:17"/>
Methods of Civil Polity, which we ſee this Age arriv'd to.</p>
            <p>Nor is it a hard matter to aſſign probable Cauſes of the Perfection in this Modern Art. I am not of their melancholy Opinion, who aſcribe it to the general Poverty of the Nation; ſince I believe 'tis eaſy to prove, the Nation it ſelf, taking it as one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Stock, is not at all diminiſh'd or impoveriſh'd by this Long, this Chargeable War; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was never Richer, ſince it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited.</p>
            <p>Nor am I abſolutely of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we are ſo happy as to be Wiſer in this Age, than our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers; tho' at the ſame time I muſt own, ſome parts of Knowledge in Science as well as Art, has received Improvements in this Age, altogether conceal'd from the former.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0411500300:18"/>
The Art of War, which I take to be the higheſt Perfection of Human Knowledge, is a ſufficient Proof of what I ſay, eſpecially in conducting Armies, and in offenſive Engines; <hi>witneſs</hi> the new ways of Mines, Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades, Entrenchments, Attacks, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodgments, and a long <hi>Et Cetera</hi> of New Inventions which want Names, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in Sieges and Encampments; <hi>witneſs</hi> the new ſorts of Bombs and unheard-of Mortars, of Seven to Ten Ton Weight, with which our Fleets ſtanding two or three Miles off at Sea, can imitate God Almighty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and rain <hi>Fire and Brimſtone</hi> out of Heaven, as it were, upon Towns built on the firm Land; <hi>witneſs alſo</hi> our new-invented <hi>Child of Hell,</hi> the Machine, which carries Thunder, Lightning, and Earthquakes in its
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0411500300:19"/>
Bowels, and tears up the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable Fortifications.</p>
            <p>But if I would ſearch for a Cauſe, from whence it comes to paſs that this Age ſwarms with ſuch a multitude of Projectors more than uſual; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Innumerable Conceptions which dye in the bringing forth, and (like Abortions of the Brain) only come into the Air, and diſſolve, do really every day produce new Contrivances, Engines, and Projects to get Money, never before thought of; if, I ſay, I would examine whence this comes to paſs, it muſt be thus:</p>
            <p>The Loſſes and Depredations which this War brought with it at firſt, were exceeding many, ſuffer'd chiefly by the Ill Conduct of Merchants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who did not apprehend the Danger to be really what it was: For before our Admiralty could poſſibly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0411500300:20"/>
ſettle Convoys, Cruiſers, and Stations for Men of War all over the World, the <hi>French</hi> cover'd the Sea with their Privateers, and took an incredible number of our Ships. I have heard the Loſs computed by thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they were able to gueſs, at above Fifteen Millions of Pounds <hi>ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> in Ships and Goods, in the firſt two or three Years of the War: A Sum, which if put into <hi>French,</hi> would make ſuch a rumbling Sound of great Numbers, as would fright a weak Accomptant out of his belief, being no leſs than One hundred and Ninety Millions of <hi>Livres.</hi> The weight of this Loſs fell chiefly on the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Part of the Nation; and amongſt them, on the Merchants; and amongſt them again upon the moſt refin'd Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, as the Inſurers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And an incredible number of the beſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0411500300:21"/>
in the Kingdom ſunk under the Load; as may appear a little by a Bill which once paſs'd the Houſe of Commons, for the Relief of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-Inſurers, who had ſuffered by the War with <hi>France.</hi> If a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fell, much greater were the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe who felt a ſenſible Ebb of their Fortunes, and with difficulty bore up under the Loſs of great part of their Eſtates. Theſe, prompted by Neceſſity, rack their Wits for New Contrivances, New Inventions, New Trades, Stocks, Projects, and any thing to retrieve the deſperate Credit of their Fortunes. That this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to be the Cauſe, will appear further thus; <hi>France,</hi> tho' I do not believe all the great Outcries we make of their Miſery and Diſtreſs, if one half of which be true, they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the beſt Subjects in the world;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0411500300:22"/>
yet without queſtion has felt its ſhare of the Loſſes and Damages of the War; But the Poverty there falling chiefly on the Poorer ſort of People, they have not been ſo fruitful in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and Practices of this nature, their Genius being quite of another ſtrain. As for the Gentry and more capable ſort, the firſt thing a <hi>French</hi> man flies to in his diſtreſs, is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and he ſeldom comes back from thence to Get an Eſtate by painful Induſtry, but either has his Brains knock'd out, or makes his Fortune there.</p>
            <p>If Induſtry be in any Buſineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with ſucceſs, 'tis in the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing Part of the World, who indeed may more truly be ſaid to live by their Wits than any people whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. All Foreign Negoce, tho' to ſome 'tis a plain road by the help of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0411500300:23"/>
Cuſtom, yet it is in its beginning all Project, Contrivance, and Invention. Every new Voyage the Merchant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives, is a Project; and Ships are ſent from Port to Port, as Markets and Merchandizes differ, by the help of ſtrange and Univerſal Intelligence; wherein ſome are ſo exquiſite, ſo ſwift, and ſo exact, that a Merchant ſitting at home in his Counting-houſe, at once converſes with all Parts of the known World. This, and Travel, makes a True-bred Merchant the moſt Intelligent Man in the World, and conſequently the moſt capable, when urg'd by Neceſſity, to Contrive New Ways to live. And from hence, I humbly conceive, may very properly be deriv'd the <hi>Projects,</hi> ſo much the Subject of the preſent Diſcourſe. And to this ſort of men 'tis eaſy to trace the Original of Banks, Stocks, Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jobbing,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0411500300:24"/>
Aſſurances, Friendly Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Lotteries, and the like.</p>
            <p>To this may be added, the long annual Enquiry in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons for Ways and Means, which has been a particular movement to ſet all the Heads of the Nation at work; and I appeal, with ſubmiſſion, to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of that Honourable Houſe, if the greateſt part of all the Ways and Means, out of the common road of Land-Taxes, Polls, and the like, have not been handed to them from the Merchant, and in a great meaſure Paid by 'em too.</p>
            <p>However I offer this but as an Eſſay at the Original of this prevaling Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the People; and as 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable ſo, 'tis alſo poſſible to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; which I ſubmit to future de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0411500300:25"/>
Of the ſeveral ways this Faculty of Projecting have exerted it ſelf, and of the various Methods, as the Genius of the Authors has inclin'd, I have been a diligent Obſerver, and in moſt an unconcern'd Spectator; and, perhaps, have ſome advantage from thence more eaſily to diſcover the <hi>faux Pas</hi> of the Actors. If I have given an Eſſay towards any thing New, or made Diſcovery to advantage of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance now on foot, all Men are at the liberty to make uſe of the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; if any Fraud is diſcover'd, as now practis'd, 'tis without any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Reflection upon Parties or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>Projects of the nature I Treat about, are doubtleſs in general of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Advantage, as they tend to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Trade, and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Poor, and the Circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0411500300:26"/>
and Increaſe of the publick Stock of the Kingdom; but this is ſuppos'd of ſuch as are built on the honeſt Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of Ingenuity and Improvement; in which, tho' I'le allow the Author to aim primarily at his own Advantage, yet with the circumſtances of Publick Benefit added.</p>
            <p>Wherefore 'tis neceſſary to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh among the Projects of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times, between the Honeſt and the Diſhoneſt.</p>
            <p>There are, and that too many, fair pretences of fine Diſcoveries, new Inventions, Engines, and I know not what, which being advanc'd in Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and talk'd up to great things to be perform'd when ſuch and ſuch Sums of Money ſhall be advanc'd, and ſuch and ſuch Engines are made, have rais'd the Fancies of Credulous People to ſuch height, that meerly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0411500300:27"/>
on the ſhadow of Expectation, they have form'd Companies, choſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, appointed Officers, Shares, and Books, rais'd great Stocks, and cri'd up an empty Notion to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that People have been betray'd to part with their Money for Shares in a <hi>New-Nothing;</hi> and when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors have carri'd on the Jeſt till they have Sold all their own Intereſt, they leave the Cloud to vaniſh of it ſelf, and the poor Purchaſers to Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with one another, and go to Law about Settlements, Transferrings, and ſome Bone or other thrown among 'em by the Subtlety of the Author, to lay the blame of the Miſcarriage upon themſelves. Thus the Shares at firſt begin to fall by degrees, and happy is he that Sells in time; till like Braſs Money it will go at laſt for nothing at all. So have I ſeen Shares
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0411500300:28"/>
in Joint-Stocks, Patents, Engines, and Undertakings, blown up by the air of great Words, and the Name of ſome Man of Credit concerned, to 100 <hi>l.</hi> for a 500<hi>th.</hi> Part, or Share, ſome more, and at laſt dwindle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, till it has been Stock-Jobb'd down to 10, 12, 9, 8 <hi>l.</hi> a Share, and at laſt no Buyer; that is, in ſhort, the fine new word for Nothing-worth, and many Families ruin'd by the Purchaſe. If I ſhould name <hi>Linnen-Manufactures, Saltpeter-Works, Copper-Mines, Diving-Engines, Dipping,</hi> and the like, for inſtances of this, I ſhou'd, I believe, do no wrong to Truth, or to ſome Perſons too viſibly guilty.</p>
            <p>I might go on upon this Subject to expoſe the Frauds and Tricks of <hi>Stock-Jobbers, Engineers, Patentees, Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees,</hi> with thoſe <hi>Exchange-Mountebanks</hi> we very properly call <hi>Brokers;</hi> but I have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0411500300:29"/>
not Gaul enough for ſuch a work; but as a general rule of caution to thoſe who wou'd not be Trick'd out of their Eſtates by ſuch Pretenders to New Inventions, let them obſerve, That all ſuch People who may be ſuſpected of Deſign, have aſſuredly this in their Propoſal, Your Money to the Author muſt go before the Experiment: And here I could give a very diverting Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of a Patent-Monger, whoſe Cully was no body but my ſelf; but I refer it to another occaſion.</p>
            <p>But this is no reaſon why Invention upon honeſt foundations, and to fair purpoſes, ſhou'd not be encourag'd; no, nor why the Author of any ſuch fair Contrivances ſhould not reap the harveſt of his own Ingenuity; out Acts of Parliament for granting Patents to firſt Inventors for Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, is a ſufficient acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0411500300:30"/>
of the due regard which ought to be had ſuch as find out any thing which may be of publick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; new Diſcoveries in Trade, in Arts and Myſteries, of Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturing Goods, or Improvement of Land, are without queſtion of as great benefit, as any Diſcoveries made in the Works of Nature by all the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies</hi> and <hi>Royal Societies</hi> in the world.</p>
            <p>There is, 'tis true, a great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between <hi>New Inventions</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> between Improvement of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures or Lands, which tend to the immediate Benefit of the Publick, and Imploying of the Poor; and Projects fram'd by ſubtle Heads, with a ſort of a <hi>Deceptio Viſus,</hi> and <hi>Legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> to bring People to run needleſs and unuſual hazards: I grant it, and give a due preference to the firſt, and yet Succeſs has ſo ſanctifi'd ſome of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0411500300:31"/>
thoſe other ſorts of Projects, that 'twou'd be a kind of Blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Fortune to diſallow 'em; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Sir <hi>William Phips</hi>'s Voyage to the Wreck; 'twas a mere Project, a Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of a Hundred thouſand to One odds; a hazard, which if it had fail'd, every body wou'd have been aſham'd to have own'd themſelves concern'd in; a Voyage that wou'd have been as much ridicul'd as <hi>Don Quixot's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture upon the Windmill:</hi> Bleſs us! that Folks ſhould go Three thouſand Miles to Angle in the open Sea for Pieces of Eight! why, they wou'd have made Ballads of it, and the Merchants wou'd have ſaid of every unlikely Adventure, 'Twas like <hi>Phips</hi> his Wreck-Voyage; but it had Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and who reflects upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject?</p>

            <head>THE Hiſtory of Projects.</head>
            <p>WHEN I ſpeak of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a <hi>Hiſtory of Projects,</hi> I do not mean either of the Introduction of, or Continuing neceſſary Inventions, or the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Arts and Sciences before known; but a ſhort Account of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and Projecting, as the Word is allow'd in the general Acceptation at this preſent time, and I need not go far back for the Original of the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
            <p>Invention of Arts with Engines and Handycraft Inſtruments for their Improvement, requires a Chronology
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0411500300:35"/>
as far back as the Eldeſt Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> and has to this day afforded ſome new Diſcovery in every Age.</p>
            <p>The Building of the Ark by <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo far as you will allow it a human Work, was the firſt Project I read of; and no queſtion ſeem'd ſo ridiculous to the Graver Heads of that Wiſe, tho' Wicked Age, that poor <hi>Noah</hi> was ſufficiently banter'd for it; and had he not been ſet on work by a very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Direction from Heaven, the Good old Man would certainly have been laugh'd out of it, as a moſt ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ridiculous Project.</p>
            <p>The Building of <hi>Babel</hi> was a Right Project; for indeed the true definition of a Project, according to Modern Acceptation, is, as is ſaid before, a vaſt Undertaking, too big to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd, and therefore likely enough to come to nothing; and yet as great as they are, 'tis certainly true of 'em all,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0411500300:36"/>
even as the Projectors propoſe; that according to the old tale, If ſo many Eggs are hatch'd, there will be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chickens, and thoſe Chickens may lay ſo many Eggs more, and thoſe Eggs produce ſo many Chickens more, and ſo on. Thus 'twas moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, That if the People of the Old World cou'd have Built a Houſe up to Heaven, they ſhou'd never be Drown'd again on Earth, and they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had forgot to Meaſure the Heighth, <hi>that is,</hi> as in other Projects, it only Miſcarri'd, or elſe 'twou'd have Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
            <p>And yet when all's done, that very Building, and the incredible Heighth it was carri'd, is a Demonſtration of the vaſt Knowledge of that Infant-Age of the World, who had no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Experiments or Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any before themſelves.</p>

            </q>
            <p>I believe a very diverting Account might be given of this, but I ſhall not attempt it. Some are apt to ſay with <hi>Solomon, No new thing happens under the Sun, but what is, has been;</hi> yet I make no queſtion but ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Diſcovery has been made in theſe latter Ages, and Inventions of Human Original produc'd, which the World was ever without before, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in whole, or in part; and I refer only to two Cardinal Points, the uſe of the Load-ſtone at Sea, and the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0411500300:38"/>
uſe of Gunpowder and Guns; both which, as to the Inventing-part, I believe the World owes as abſolutely to thoſe particular Ages, as it does the Working in Braſs and Iron to <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal Cain,</hi> or the Inventing of Muſick to <hi>Jubal</hi> his Brother. As to Engines and Inſtruments for Handycraft-Men, this Age, I dare ſay, can ſhow ſuch as never were ſo much as thought of, much leſs imitated before; for I do not call that a real Invention which has ſomething before done like it, I account that more properly an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. For Handycraft Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I know none owes more to true genuine Contrivance, without bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing from any former uſe, than a Mechanick Engine contriv'd in our time, call'd, <hi>A Knitting Frame,</hi> which built with admirable Symetry, works really with a very happy Succeſs, and may be obſerv'd by the Curious to have a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0411500300:39"/>
more than ordinary Compoſition; for which I refer to the Engine it ſelf, to be ſeen in every Stocking-Weaver's Garret.</p>
            <p>I ſhall trace the Original of the Projecting Humour that now reigns, no farther back than the Year 1680. dating its Birth as a Monſter then, tho' by times it had indeed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of life in the time of the late Civil War. I allow, no Age has been altogether without ſomething of this nature; and ſome very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Projects are left to us as a taſte of their Succeſs; as the Water-houſes for ſupplying of the City of <hi>London</hi> with Water; and ſince that, the <hi>New-River,</hi> both very Conſiderable Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and Perfect Projects, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd on the riſque of Succeſs. In the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, infinite Projects were ſet on foot for Raiſing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney without a Parliament; Oppreſſing by Monopolies, and Privy Seals; but
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0411500300:40"/>
theſe are excluded our Scheme, as Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities; for thus the <hi>French</hi> are as fruitful in Projects as we; and theſe are rather Stratagems than Projects. After the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of an Engine to Quench Fires, was a Project the Author was ſaid to get well by, and we have found to be very uſeful. But about the Year 1680. began the Art and Myſtery of Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting to creep into the World. Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> Uncle to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, gave great Encouragement to that part of it that reſpects Engines, and Mechanical Motions; and Biſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi> added as much of the Theory to it, as writing a Book could do: The Prince has left us a Metal call'd by his Name; and the firſt Project upon that was, as I remember, Caſting of Guns of that Metal, and boring them; done both by a peculiar Method of his own, and which died with him,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0411500300:41"/>
to the great loſs of the Undertaker, who to that purpoſe had, with no ſmall Charge, erected a Water-Mill at <hi>Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-Marſh,</hi> known by the name of the <hi>Temple-Mill:</hi> Which Mill very happily perform'd all parts of the Work; and I have ſeen of thoſe Guns on board the Royal <hi>Charles,</hi> a Firſt-rate Ship, being of a Reddiſh Colour, different either from Braſs or Copper. I have heard ſome Reaſons of State aſſign'd, why that Project was not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to go forward; but I omit them, becauſe I have no good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for it: After this, we ſaw a Floating Machine, to be wrought with Horſes for the Towing of Great Ships both againſt Wind and Tide; and another for the raiſing of Ballaſt which, as unperforming Engines, had the honour of being Made, Expos'd, Tri'd, and laid by, before the Prince died.</p>

If thus we introduce it into the World under the Conduct of that Prince; when he died, 'twas left a hopeleſs Brat, and had hardly any Hand to own it, till the Wreck-Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age before-noted, perform'd ſo happily by Captain <hi>Phips,</hi> afterwards Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam;</hi> whoſe ſtrange Performance ſet a great many Heads on work to contrive ſomething for themſelves; he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follow'd by my Lord <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> Sir <hi>John Narborough,</hi> and others from ſeveral Parts, whoſe Succeſs made 'em ſoon weary of the Work.</p>
            <p>The Project of the <hi>Penny-Poſt,</hi> ſo well known, and ſtill practis'd, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit; nor the Contriver Mr. <hi>Dock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wra,</hi> who has had the honour to have the Injury done him in that Affair, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd in ſome meaſure by the publick Juſtice of the Parliament. And the Experiment proving it to be a Noble and Uſeful Deſign, the Author muſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0411500300:43"/>
be remembred, where-ever mention is made of that Affair, to his very great Reputation.</p>
            <p>'Twas no queſtion a great hardſhip for a man to be Maſter of ſo fine a Thought, that had <hi>both</hi> the <hi>Eſſential Ends of a Project</hi> in it, <hi>Publick Good,</hi> and <hi>Private Advantage;</hi> and that the Publick ſhou'd reap the benefit, and the Author be left out; the Injuſtice of which, no doubt, diſcourag'd many a Good Deſign: But ſince an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Publick Circumſtances has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd the loſt Attribute of Juſtice, the like is not to be fear'd. And Mr. <hi>Dock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wra</hi> has had the ſatisfaction to ſee the former Injury diſown'd, and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Return made even by them who did not the Injury, in bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Ingenuity.</p>
            <p>A while before this, ſeveral Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, under the Patronage of ſome great Perſons, had engag'd in Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0411500300:44"/>
of Foreign Collonies; as <hi>William Pen,</hi> the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cox,</hi> and others, in <hi>Penſilvania, Carolina, Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Jerſey,</hi> and the like places; which I do not call Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, becauſe 'twas only proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what had been formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun: But here began the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of publick Joint-Stocks, which, together with the <hi>Eaſt-India, African,</hi> and <hi>Hudſon's-Bay</hi> Companies, before eſtabliſh'd, begot a New Trade, which we call by a new Name, <hi>Stock-Jobbing,</hi> which was at firſt only the ſimple Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Transferring of Intereſt and Shares from one to another, as Perſons alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated their Eſtates; but by the Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Exchange-Brokers, who got the buſineſs into their hands, it became a Trade; and one perhaps manag'd with the greateſt Intriegue, Artifice, and Trick, that ever any thing that appear'd with a face of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0411500300:45"/>
could be handl'd with; for while the Brokers held the Box, they made the whole <hi>Exchange</hi> the Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and rais'd and lower'd the Prices of Stocks as they pleas'd; and always had both Buyers and Sellers who ſtood ready innocently to commit their Money to the mercy of their Mercenary Tongues. This Upſtart of a Trade having taſted the ſweetneſs of Succeſs which generally attends a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel Propoſal,</hi> introduces the Illigiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate wandring Object I ſpeak of, as a proper Engine to find Work for the Brokers. Thus Stock-Jobbing nurs'd Projecting, and Projecting in return has very diligently pimp'd for its Foſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, till both are arriv'd to be Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Grievances; and indeed are now almoſt grown ſcandalous.</p>

               <p>BANKS, without queſtion, if rightly manag'd, are, or may be, of great Advantage, eſpecially to a Trading People, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are; and among many others, this is one particular caſe in which that Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit appears, That they bring down the Intereſt of Money, and take from the Goldſmiths, Scriveners, and others, who have command of running Caſh, their moſt delicious Trade of making advantage of the neceſſities of the Merchant, in extravagant Diſcounts, and Premio's for advance of Money, when either large Cuſtoms or Foreign Remittances, call for Disburſements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his common Ability; for by the eaſineſs of Terms on which the Merchant may have Money, he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd to venture further in Trade
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0411500300:52"/>
than otherwiſe he would do; not but that there are other great advantages a <hi>Royal Bank</hi> might procure in this Kingdom, as has been ſeen in part by this, As advancing Money to the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer</hi> upon Parliamentary Funds and Securities, by which in time of a War our Preparations for any Expedition need not be in danger of Miſcarriage for want of Money, though the Taxes rais'd be not ſpeedily paid, nor the <hi>Exchequer</hi> burthen'd with the exceſſive Intereſts paid in former Reigns upon Anticipations of the Revenue; Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men might be ſupplied with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys upon Securities on eaſier Terms, which would prevent the Loſs of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Eſtates, now ruin'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by inſolent and mercileſs Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagees and the like. But now we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily ſee a <hi>Royal Bank</hi> Eſtabliſh'd by Act of Parliament, and another with a large Fund upon the <hi>Orphans</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0411500300:53"/>
Stock; and yet theſe Advantages, or others, which we expected, not anſwer'd, tho' the pretenſions in Both have not been wanting at ſuch time as they found it needful to introduce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into publick Eſteem, by giving out Prints of what they were rather able to do, than really intended to practice. So that our having Two Banks at this time ſettl'd, and more Erecting, has not yet been able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Intereſt of Money; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Nature and Foundation of their Conſtitution does not tend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; but becauſe, finding their Hands full of better buſineſs, they are wiſer than by being ſlaves to old ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelete Propoſals, to loſe the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the great Improvement they can make of their Stock.</p>
               <p>This however, does not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the Nature of a Bank, nor of the Benefit it would be to the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0411500300:54"/>
publick Trading-part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whatever it may ſeem to do on the practice of the preſent. We find Four or Five Banks now in view to be ſettl'd; I confeſs I expect no more from thoſe to come, than we have found from the paſt; and I think I make no breach on either my Charity or <hi>good Manners,</hi> in ſaying ſo; and I reflect not upon any of the Banks that are or ſhall be Eſtabliſh'd for not doing what I mention, but for making ſuch publications of what they would do. I cannot think any Man had expected the <hi>Royal Bank</hi> ſhou'd Lend Money on Mortgages at 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> nor was it much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them to make publication they wou'd do ſo, from the beginning of <hi>January</hi> next after their Settlement; ſince to this day, as I am inform'd, they have not Lent one Farthing in that manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0411500300:55"/>
Our Banks are indeed nothing but ſo many Goldſmiths Shops, where the Credit being high (and the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors as high) People lodge their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and They, the Directors I mean, make their advantage of it; if you lay it at Demand, they allow you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; if at Time, 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and ſo wou'd any Goldſmith in <hi>Lombardſtreet</hi> have done before; but the very Banks themſelves are ſo aukward in Lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo ſtrict, ſo tedions, ſo inquiſitive, and withal ſo publick in their taking Securities, that Men who are any thing tender, won't go to them; and ſo the eaſineſs of Borrowing Money, ſo much deſign'd, is defeated; for here is a private Intereſt to be made, tho' it be a publick one; and, in ſhort, 'tis only a great Trade carri'd on for the private Gain of a few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Original Stock; and tho' we are to hope for great things,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0411500300:56"/>
becauſe they have promis'd them; yet they are all Future that we know of.</p>
               <p>And yet all this while a Bank might be very beneficial to this Kingdom; and This might be ſo, if either their own Ingenuity, or Publick Authority, would oblige them to take the Publick Good into equal Concern with their Private Intereſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To explain what I mean;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Banks being eſtabliſh'd by Publick Authority, ought alſo, as all Publick things are, to be under Limitations and Reſtrictions from that Authority; and thoſe Limitations being regulated with a proper regard to the Eaſe of Trade in General, and the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Stock in Particular, would make a Bank a Uſeful, Profitable Thing indeed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A Bank ought to be of a Magnitude proportion'd to the Trade of the Countrey it is in; which this
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0411500300:57"/>
Bank is ſo far from, that 'tis no more to the Whole, than the leaſt Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith's Caſh in <hi>Lombardſtreet</hi> is to the Bank: From whence it comes to paſs, that already more Banks are contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and I queſtion not but Banks in <hi>London</hi> will e're long be as frequent as Lotteries: The Conſequence of which in all Probability will be, the diminiſhing their Reputation, or a Civil War with one another. 'Tis true, the Bank of <hi>England</hi> has a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Stock; but yet was that Stock wholly clear of the Publick Concern of the Government, it is not above a Fifth Part of what would be neceſſary to manage the whole Buſineſs of the Town; which it ought, tho' not to do, at leaſt to be Able to do: And I ſuppoſe I may venture to ſay, Above one half of the Stock of the preſent Bank is taken up in the Affairs of the Exchequer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0411500300:58"/>
I ſuppoſe no body will take this Diſcourſe for an Invective againſt the Bank of <hi>England;</hi> I believe it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Good Fund, a very Uſeful one, and a very Profitable one: It has been Uſeful to the Government, and it is Profitable to the Proprietors; and the eſtabliſhing it at ſuch a Juncture, when our Enemies were making great boaſts of our Poverty and Want of Money, was a particular Glory to our Nation, and the City in particular. That when the <hi>Paris Gazette</hi> inform'd the World, That the Parliament had indeed given the King Grants for raiſing Money in Funds to be paid in remote Years; but Money was ſo ſcarce, that no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipations could be procured: That juſt then, beſides Three Millions paid into the Exchequer that Spring on other Taxes by way of Advance, there was an Overplus-Stock to be found of 1200 000 Pounds <hi>ſterling</hi> or (to make
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0411500300:59"/>
it ſpeak <hi>French</hi>) of above Fifteen Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, which was all paid Voluntarily into the Exchequer, in leſs than <gap reason="blank" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈1 span left blank〉</desc>
                  </gap> Beſides this, I believe the preſent Bank of <hi>England</hi> has been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful to the Exchequer, and to ſupply the King with Remittances for the Payment of the Army in <hi>Flanders;</hi> which has alſo, by the way, been very profitable to it ſelf. But ſtill this Bank is not of that Bulk that the Buſineſs done here requires; nor is it able, with all the Stock it has, to procure the great propos'd Benefit, the low'r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Intereſt of Money: Whereas all Foreign Banks abſolutely govern the Intereſt, both at <hi>Amſterdam, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi> and other places. And this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect I conceive the Multiplicity of Banks cannot ſupply, unleſs a perfect Underſtanding could be ſecur'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
               <p>To remedy this Defect, ſeveral
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0411500300:60"/>
Methods might be propos'd: Some I ſhall take the Freedom to hint at.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the preſent Bank in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their Stock to at leaſt Five Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions <hi>ſterling,</hi> to be ſettled as they are already, with ſome ſmall Limitations to make the Methods more beneficial.</p>
               <p>Five Millions <hi>ſterling</hi> is an immenſe Sum; to which add the Credit of their Caſh, which would ſupply them with all the Overplus-Money in the Town, and probably might amount to half as much more; and then the Credit of Running-Bills, which by circulating would no queſtion be an Equivalent to the other half: So that in Stock, Credit, and Bank-bills, the Balance of their Caſh would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Ten Millions <hi>ſterling:</hi> A Sum that every body who can talk of, does not underſtand.</p>
               <p>But then to find Buſineſs for all this Stock; which though it be a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0411500300:61"/>
ſtrange thing to think of, is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs eaſy when it comes to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd. And firſt for the Buſineſs; This Bank ſhou'd enlarge the Number of their Directors as they do of their Stock; and ſhould then eſtabliſh ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sub-Committees, compos'd of their own Members, who ſhould have the directing of ſeveral Offices rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the diſtinct ſorts of Buſineſs they referr'd to; to be over-rul'd and govern'd by the Governor and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors in a Body, but to have a Concluſive Power as to Contracts. Of theſe there ſhould be</p>
               <p>One Office for Loan of Money for Cuſtoms of Goods; which by a plain Method might be ſo order'd, that the Merchant might with eaſe pay the higheſt Cuſtoms down; and ſo by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Bank 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Advance, be firſt ſure to ſecure the 10 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> which the King allows for Prompt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0411500300:62"/>
Payment at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe;</hi> and be alſo freed from the troubleſome work of finding <hi>Bonds-Men,</hi> and Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the Money; which has expos'd many a Man to the Tyranny of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents either for himſelf or his Friend, to his utter Ruin; who under a more moderate Proſecution, had been able to pay all his Debts; and by this Method has been torn to pieces, and diſabled from making any tolerable Propoſal to his Creditors. This is a Scene of Large Buſineſs, and would in proportion employ a Large Caſh: And 'tis the eaſieſt thing in the world to make the Bank the Paymaſter of all the Large Cuſtoms, and yet the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant have ſo honourable a Poſſeſſion of his Goods, as may be neither any Diminution to his Reputation, or any Hindrance to their Sale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for Example:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe I have 100 Hogſheads of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0411500300:63"/>
Tobacco to Import, whoſe Cuſtoms by ſeveral Duties comes to 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and want Caſh to clear them; I go with my Bill of Loading to the Bank, who appoint their Officer to Enter the Goods, and pay the Duties; which Goods ſo entred by the Bank, ſhall give them Title enough to any part, or the whole, without the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Bills of Sale, or Conveyances, Defeazances, and the like. The Goods are carried to a Warehouſe at the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſide, where the Merchant has a Free and Publick Acceſs to them, as if in his own Warehouſe, and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Liberty to ſell and deliver either the Whole (paying their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe) or a Part without it, leaving but ſufficient for the Payment; and out of that Part delivered, either by Notes under the Hand of the Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, or any other way, he may clear the ſame, without any Exactions, but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0411500300:64"/>
of 4 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> and the reſt are his own.</p>
               <p>The eaſe this wou'd bring to Trade, the deliverance it wou'd bring to the Merchants from the inſults of Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the honour it wou'd give to our management of Publick Impoſts, with the advantages to the Cuſtom-Houſe it ſelf, and the utter deſtruction of Extortion, wou'd be ſuch as wou'd give a due value to the Bank, and make all Mankind acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be a publick good. The Grievance of Exactions upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants in this caſe is very great; and when I lay the blame on the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths, becauſe they are the principal People made uſe of in ſuch occaſions, I include a great many other ſorts of Brokers, and Money-jobbing Artiſts, who all get a ſnip out of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant. I my ſelf have known a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith in <hi>Lumbardſtreet</hi> Lend a Man
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0411500300:65"/>
700 <hi>l.</hi> to pay the Cuſtoms of a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pipes of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wines; the Wines were made over to him for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity by Bill of Sale, and put into a Cellar, of which the Goldſmith kept the Key; the Merchant was to pay 6 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> Intereſt on the Bond, and to allow 10 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> Premio for advancing the Money: When he had the Wines in Poſſeſſion, the Owner cou'd not ſend his Cooper to look after them, but the Goldſmith's Man muſt attend all the while, for which he wou'd be paid 5 <hi>s.</hi> a day.

               <p>One other Office of this Bank, and which wou'd take up a conſiderable branch of the Stock, is for Lending Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney upon Pledges, which ſhou'd have annex'd to it a Warehouſe and Factory, where all ſorts of Goods might pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly be Sold by the Conſent of the Owners, to the great Advantage of the Owner, the Bank receiving 4 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> Intereſt, and 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for Sale of the Goods.</p>

               <p>A Sixth for Inland Exchanges, where a very large Field of Buſineſs lies before them.</p>

               <p>As to Publick Advancings of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the Government, they may be left to the Directors in a Body, as all other Diſputes and Contingent caſes are; and whoever examines theſe Heads of Buſineſs apart, and has any Judgment in the Particulars, will, I ſuppoſe, allow, that a Stock of Ten Millions may find Employment in them, though it be indeed a very great Sum.</p>
               <p>I cou'd offer ſome very good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, why this way of Management by particular Offices for every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſort of Buſineſs, is not only the eaſieſt, but the ſafeſt way of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an Affair of ſuch variety and conſequence; alſo I cou'd ſtate a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for the Proceedings of thoſe private Offices, their Conjunction with, and Dependence on the General

               <p>If it be Objected here, That it is impoſſible for One Joint Stock to go thorough the whole Buſineſs of the Kingdom. I Anſwer, I believe it is not either impoſſible or impracticable, particularly on this one account, that almoſt all the Country Buſineſs wou'd be Manag'd by running-Bills, and thoſe the longeſt abroad of any, their diſtance keeping them out, to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the Credit, and conſequently the Stock of the Bank.</p>

                  <p>A <hi>Civil War</hi> among Merchants is always the Ruin of Trade: I cannot think a Multitude of Banks cou'd ſo conſiſt with one another in <hi>England,</hi> as to join Intereſts, and uphold one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Credit, without joining Stocks too; I confeſs, if it cou'd be done, the Convenience to Trade wou'd be Viſible.</p>

If I were to Propoſe which way theſe Banks ſhou'd be Eſtabliſh'd; I anſwer, Allowing a due regard to ſome Gentlemen who have had thoughts of the ſame, whoſe Methods I ſhall not ſo much as touch upon, much leſs diſcover; My thoughts run upon quite different Methods, both for the Fund, and the Eſtabliſhment.</p>
                  <p>Every principal Town in <hi>England</hi> is a Corporation, upon which the Fund may be ſettled; which will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently anſwer the difficult and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able work of Suing for a Corporation by Patent or Act of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>A general Subſcription of Stock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made, and by Deeds of Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment plac'd in the Mayor and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the City or Corporation for the time being, in Truſt, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by Deeds of Uſes, ſome of the Directors being always made Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſaid Corporation, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0411500300:75"/>
join'd in the Truſt, the Bank hereby becomes the Publick Stock of the Town, ſomething like what they call the <hi>Rents of the Town-Houſe</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and is Manag'd in the Name of the ſaid Corporation, to whom the Directors are Accountable, and they back again to the General Court.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For Example:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suppoſe the Gentlemen, or Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of the County of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> by a Subſcription of Caſh, deſign to Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a Bank: The Subſcriptions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made, the Stock is paid into the Chamber of the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and manag'd by a Court of Directors, as all Banks are, and choſen out of the Subſcribers, the Mayor only of the City to be always one; to be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Name of the Corporation of the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> but for the Uſes in a Deed of Truſt to be made by the Subſcribers, and Mayor and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0411500300:76"/>
Aldermen, at large mentioned. I make no queſtion but a Bank thus ſettled, wou'd have as firm a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation as any Bank need to have, and every way anſwer the Ends of a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration.</p>

is to underſtand to have no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the preſent Poſture of Affairs, with reſpect to the Scarcity of Currant Money, which ſeems to have put a ſtop to that part of a Stock we call Credit; which always is, and indeed muſt be the moſt eſſential part of a Bank, and without which no Bank can pretend to ſubſiſt, at leaſt to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                  <p>A Bank is only a Great Stock of Money put together, to be employ'd by ſome of the Subſcribers, in the name of the reſt, for the Benefit of the Whole. This Stock of Money ſubſiſts not barely on the Profits of its own Stock, for that wou'd be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, but upon the Contingences and Accidents which Multiplicity of Buſineſs occaſions: As for Inſtance; A man that comes for Money, and knows he may have it To-morrow, perhaps he is in haſte, and won't take
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0411500300:80"/>
it to day: Only that he may be ſure of it to morrow, he takes a <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum</hi> under the Hand of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, That he ſhall have it whenever he calls for it; and this <hi>Memorandum</hi> we call a Bill. To morrow when he Intended to fetch his Money, comes a Man to him for Money; and to ſave himſelf the labour of Telling, he gives him the <hi>Memorandum</hi> or Bill aforeſaid for his Money; this Second Man does as the Firſt, and a Third does as he did, and ſo the Bill runs about a Month, Two or Three; and this is that we call <hi>Credit;</hi> for by the Circulation of a quantity of theſe Bills, the Bank enjoys the full Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of as much Stock in real Value, as the ſuppoſititious Value of the Bills amounts to; and where-ever this Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit fails, this Advantage fails; for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately all men come for their Money, and the Bank muſt die of it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0411500300:81"/>
ſelf; for I am ſure no Bank by the ſimple Improvement of their ſingle Stock, can ever make any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Advantage.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs a Bank who can lay a Fund for the Security of their Bills, which ſhall produce, firſt an Annual Profit to the Owner, and yet make good the Paſſant-Bill, may ſtand, and be advantageous too, becauſe there is a Real and a Suppoſititious Value both, and the Real always ready to make good the Suppoſititious; and this I know no way to bring to paſs, but by Land, which at the ſame time that it lies Transferr'd to ſecure the Value of every Bill given out, brings in a ſeparate Profit to the Owner; and this way no queſtion but the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom might be a Bank to it ſelf, tho' no ready Money were to be found in it.</p>
                  <p>I had gone on in ſome Sheets
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0411500300:82"/>
with my Notion of Land, being the beſt bottom for Publick Banks, and the eaſineſs of bringing it to anſwer all the Ends of Money depoſited, with double Advantage; but I find my ſelf happily prevented by a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who has publiſh'd the very ſame, tho' ſince this was Wrote; and I was always Maſter of ſo much Wit, as to hold my Tongue while they ſpoke who underſtood the thing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>John Aſgill</hi> of <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> in a ſmall Tract, Entituled, <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſertions prov'd, in Order to Create another Species of Money than Gold and Silver,</hi> has ſo diſtinctly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this very Caſe, with ſuch ſtrength of Argument, ſuch clearneſs of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſuch a Judgment, and ſuch a Stile, as all the Ingenious part of the World muſt acknowledge themſelves extremely Oblig'd to him for that Piece.</p>

               <head>Of the HIGH-WAYS.</head>
               <p>IT is a prodigious Charge the whole Nation groans under for the Repair of High-Ways, which, after all, lie in a very ill Poſture too; I make no queſtion but if it was taken into Conſideration by thoſe who have the Power to Direct it, the Kingdom might be wholly eas'd of that Burthen, and the High-Ways be kept in good condition, which now lie in a moſt ſhameful manner in moſt
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0411500300:84"/>
parts of the Kingdom, and in many places wholly unpaſſable; from whence ariſe Tolls and Impoſitions upon Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers and Travellers; and on the other hand, Treſpaſſes and Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Lands adjacent, to the great Damage of the Owners.</p>
               <p>The Rate for the High-Ways is the moſt Arbitrary and Unequal Tax in the Kingdom; in ſome places two or three Rates of 6 <hi>d. per. l.</hi> in the year, in others the whole Pariſh cannot raiſe wherewith to defray the Charge, either by the very bad condition of the Road, or diſtance of Materials; in others the Surveyors raiſe what they never Expend; and the Abuſes, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, Connivances, Frauds, and Embezlements, are innumerable.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans,</hi> while they Govern'd this Iſland, made it one of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cares to Make and Repair the High-Ways of the Kingdom, and the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0411500300:85"/>
Chief Roads we now uſe, are of their Marking out; the Conſequence of maintaining them was ſuch, or at leaſt ſo eſteem'd, that they thought it not below them to Employ their <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionary Troops</hi> in the Work; and it was ſometimes the Buſineſs of whole Armies, either when in Winter-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or in the intervals of Truce or Peace with the Natives. Nor have the <hi>Romans</hi> left us any greater tokens of their Grandeur and Magnificence, than the ruins of thoſe Cauſways and Street<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways which are at this day to be ſeen in many parts of the Kingdom; ſome of which has by the viſible Remains been diſcover'd to traverſe the whole Kingdom; and others for more than an Hundred Miles are to be trac'd from Colony to Colony, as they had particular occaſion. The famous High-Way, or Street, call'd <hi>Watling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> which ſome will tell you began
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0411500300:86"/>
at <hi>London-ſtone,</hi> and paſſing that very Street in the City, which we to this day call by that Name, went on <hi>Weſt</hi> to that ſpot where <hi>Tyburn</hi> now ſtands, and then turn'd <hi>North-Weſt</hi> in ſo ſtraight a line to St. <hi>Albans,</hi> that 'tis now the exacteſt Road (in one Line for Twenty Miles) in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and tho' diſus'd now as the Chief, yet is as good, and I believe the beſt Road to St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and is ſtill call'd the <hi>Street-way:</hi> From whence it is trac'd into <hi>Shropſhire</hi> above an Hundred and ſixty Miles, with a multitude of viſible Antiquities upon it, Diſcover'd and Deſcrib'd very A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately by Mr. <hi>Cambden.</hi> The <hi>Foſſe,</hi> another <hi>Roman</hi> Work, lies at this day as viſible, and as plain a high Cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, of above Thirty Foot broad, Ditch'd on either ſide, and Cop'd and Pav'd where need is, as exact and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry jot as beautiful as the King's new
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0411500300:87"/>
Road through <hi>Hide-Park;</hi> in which figure it now lies from near <hi>Marſhfield</hi> to <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> and again from <hi>Cirenceſter</hi> to the Hill Three Miles on this ſide <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> which is not leſs than Twenty ſix Miles, and is made uſe of as the great Road to thoſe Towns, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably has been ſo for a Thouſand Years with little Repairs.</p>
               <p>If we ſet aſide the Barbarity and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Heathens,</hi> and take them as a Civil Government, we muſt allow they were the Pattern of the whole World for Improvement and Increaſe of Arts and Learning, Civilizing and Methodizing Nations and Countries Conquer'd by their Valour; and if this was one of their great Cares, That conſideration ought to move ſomething.

               <p>But before I proceed, I muſt ſay a word or two to this Article.</p>
               <p>The Chief, and almoſt the Only Cauſe of the deepneſs and foulneſs of the Roads, is occaſion'd by the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water, which for want of due care to draw it off by ſcouring and opening Ditches and Dreins, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Water-Courſes, and clearing of Paſſages, ſoaks into the Earth, and ſoftens it to ſuch a degree, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear the weight of Horſes and Carriages; to prevent which, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Dig, Trench, and Cut down, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mention'd above, will be of abſolute neceſſity: But becauſe the liberty

ſeems very large, and ſome may think 'tis too great a Power to be granted to any Body of Men over their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: 'Tis anſwer'd;<list>
                     <item>(1.) 'Tis abſolutely neceſſary, or the Work cannot be done; and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Work is of much greater Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit than the Damage can amount to.</item>
                     <item>(2.) Satisfaction to be made to the Owner, and that firſt too, before the Damage be done, is an Unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Equivalent; and Both together, I think, are a very full Anſwer to any Objection in That caſe.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides this Act of Parliament, a Commiſſion muſt be granted to Fifteen, at leaſt, in the Name of the Undertakers, to whom every County ſhall have Power to join Ten, who are to Sit with the ſaid Fifteen, ſo often and ſo long as the ſaid Fifteen do Sit for Affairs relating to that County; which Fifteen, or any Seven of them,

               <p>This Commiſſion ſhall give Power to the ſaid Fifteen to preſs Wagons, Carts, and Horſes, Oxen, and Men, and detain them to work a certain Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Time, and within certain Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Space of Miles from their own Dwellings, and at a certain Rate of Payment: No Men, Horſes, or Carts to be preſs'd againſt their Conſent, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

the times of Hay-time, or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt; or upon Market-days, if the Perſon aggriev'd will make Affidavit he is oblig'd to be with his Horſes or Carts at the ſaid Markets.</p>
               <p>It is well known to all who have any knowledge of the Condition the High-Ways in <hi>England</hi> now lye in, that in moſt places there is a convenient diſtance of Land left open for travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, either for driving of Cattel, or marching of Troops of Horſe, with perhaps as few Lanes or <hi>Defiles,</hi> as in any Countries: The Croſs-Roads, which are generally Narrow, are yet Broad enough in moſt places for two Carriages to paſs; but on the other hand, we have on moſt of the High-Roads a great deal of waſte-Land thrown in as it were for an Overplus to the High-Way; which though it be us'd of courſe by Cattle and Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers on occaſion, is indeed no Benefit
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0411500300:95"/>
at all either to the Traveller as a Road, or to the Poor as a Common, or to the Lord of the Mannor as a Waſte; upon it grows neither Timber nor Graſs, in any quantity anſwerable to the Land; but, tho to no purpoſe, is trodden down, poach'd, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run by Drifts of Cattle in the Winter, or ſpoil'd with the Duſt in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: And this I have obſerv'd in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts of <hi>England</hi> to be as good Land as any of the Neighbouring Encloſures, as capable of Improvement, and to as good purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe Lands only being enclos'd and manur'd, leaving the Roads to Dimenſions without meaſure ſufficient, are the Fund upon which I build the Prodigious Stock of Money that muſt do this Work. Theſe Lands, which I ſhall afterwards make an Eſſay to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, being enclos'd, will be either ſale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to raiſe Money, or fit to exchange
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0411500300:96"/>
with thoſe Gentlemen who muſt part with ſome Land where the Ways are narrow: Always reſerving a quantity of theſe Lands to be Let out to Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; the Rent to be paid into the Publick Stock or Bank of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, and to be reſerv'd for keeping the Ways in the ſame Repair; and the ſaid Bank to forfeit the Lands if they are not ſo maintained.</p>
               <p>Another Branch of the Stock muſt be Hands; for a Stock of Men is a Stock of Money; to which purpoſe every County, City, Town, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, ſhall be Rated at a Set Price, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to Eight Years Payment for the Repair of High-ways; which each County, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall raiſe, not by Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsment in Money, but by preſſing of Men, Horſes, and Carriages for the Work; the Men, Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be employ'd by the Directors: In which caſe all Corporal Puniſhments,

as of <hi>Whippings, Stocks, Pillories, Houſes of Correction, &amp;c.</hi> might be eaſily tranſmitted to a certain Number of Days Works on the High-Ways, and in Conſideration of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Men, the Country ſhou'd for ever after be acquitted of any Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, either in Money or Work, for Repair of the High-Ways, Building of Bridges excepted.</p>
               <p>There lies ſome Popular Objection againſt this Undertaking; and the firſt is, the great Controverted Point of <hi>England, Encloſure of the Common,</hi> which tends to Depopulation, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures the Poor.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Who ſhall be Judges or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors of the Work, to Oblige the Undertakers to perform to a certain limited degree.</p>
               <p>For the Firſt; The Encloſure of the Common; A Clauſe that runs as far as to an Incroachment upon <hi>Magna</hi>

                     <item>(1.) The Lands we Encloſe, are not ſuch as from which the Poor do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed reap any Benefit, or at leaſt any that is conſiderable.</item>
                     <item>(2.) The Bank and Publick Stock, who are to Manage this great Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, will have ſo many little Labours to perform, and Offices to beſtow, that are fit only for Labouring Poor Perſons to do, as will put them in a condition to provide for the Poor who are ſo Injur'd, that can work; and to thoſe who cannot, may allow Penſions for Overſeeing, Superviſing, and the like, which will be more than Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</item>
                     <item>(3.) For Depopulations, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſhou'd be ſecur'd, by obliging the Undertakers, at ſuch and ſuch certain diſtances, to erect Cottages, Two at leaſt
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0411500300:99"/>
in a place, which wou'd be uſeful to the Work, and ſafety of the Traveller, to which ſhou'd be an Allotment of Land, always ſufficient to invite the Poor Inhabitant, in which the Poor ſhou'd be Tenant for Life <hi>Gratis,</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Duty upon the High-Way, as ſhou'd be appointed; by which, and many other Methods, the Poor ſhou'd be great Gainers by the Propoſal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being Injur'd.</item>
                     <item>(4.) By this erecting of Cottages at proper diſtances, a Man might Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel over all <hi>England</hi> as through a Street, where he cou'd never want, either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue from Thieves, or Directions for his way.</item>
                     <item>(5.) This very Undertaking once duly ſettled, might in a few Years ſo order it, that there ſhou'd be no Poor for the Common; and if ſo, What need of a Common for the Poor? Of which in its proper place.</item>

As to the ſecond Objection, Who ſhou'd oblige the Undertakers to the Performance?<list>
                     <item>(1.) I Anſwer, Their Commiſſion and Charter ſhou'd become Void, and all their Stock Forfeit, and the Lands Encloſed and Unſold, remain as a Pledge, which wou'd be Security ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</item>

                     <item>(3.) The Lands ſettled on the Bank ſhall be liable to be extended for the Uſes mentioned, if the ſame at any time be not maintained in the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at firſt provided, and the Bank to be amerc'd upon Complaint of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</item>

Theſe and other Conditions, which on a Legal Settlement to be made by Wiſer Heads than mine, might be thought on, I do believe wou'd form a Conſtitution ſo firm, ſo fair, and ſo equally Advantageous to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to the Poor, and to the Publick, as has not been put in practice in theſe latter Ages of the World. To Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe of this a little in general, and to inſtance in a Place, perhaps, that has not its fellow in the Kingdom, the Pariſh of <hi>Iſlington</hi> in <hi>Middleſex;</hi> there lies through this large Pariſh the greateſt Road in <hi>England,</hi> and the moſt frequented, eſpecially by Cattle for <hi>Smithfield</hi>-Market; this great Road has ſo many Branches, and lies for ſo long a way through the Pariſh, and withal has the inconvenience of a Clayey Ground, and no Gravel at hand, that, modeſtly ſpeaking, the Pariſh is not able to keep it in Repair, by which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0411500300:102"/>
means ſeveral Croſs-Roads in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh lie wholly Unpaſſable, and Carts and Horſes, and Men too, have been almoſt Buried in Holes and Sloughs, and the main Road it ſelf has for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years lain in a very ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which occaſion'd ſeveral Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Parliament to Raiſe a Toll at <hi>Highgate,</hi> for the performance of what it was impoſſible the Pariſh ſhou'd do, and yet was of ſo abſolute neceſſity to be done; And is it not very probable the Pariſh of <hi>Iſlington</hi> wou'd part with all the waſte Land upon their Roads, to be eas'd of the intolerable Aſſeſsment for Repair of the High-Way, and anſwer the Poor, who reap but a ſmall Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from it, ſome other way? And yet I am free to affirm, That for a Grant of Waſte, and almoſt uſeleſs Land, lying open to the High-Way, thoſe Lands to be improv'd, as they might eaſily be, together with the Eight

Years Aſſeſsment to be provided in Workmen, a noble Magnificent Cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way might be Erected, with Ditches on either ſide deep enough to receive the Water, and Dreins ſufficient to carry it off, which Cauſway ſhou'd be Four Foot High at leaſt, and from Thirty to Forty Foot Broad, to reach from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Barnet,</hi> pav'd in the middle, to keep it Cop'd, and ſo ſuppli'd with Gravel, and other proper Materials, as ſhou'd ſecure it from Decay with ſmall Repairing.</p>
               <p>I hope no Man wou'd be ſo weak now, as to imagine that by Lands ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open to the Road, to be Aſſign'd to the Undertakers, I ſhou'd mean that all <hi>Finchly</hi>-Common ſhou'd be Enclos'd and Sold for this Work; but leaſt ſomebody ſhou'd ſtart ſuch a prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Objection, I think 'tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to mention, That where-ever a High-Way is to be carri'd over a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0411500300:104"/>
Large Common, Foreſt, or Waſte without a Hedge on either hand for a certain diſtance, there the ſeveral Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes ſhall allot the Directors a certain quantity of the Common to lie Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel with the Road, at a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned number of Feet to the Length and Breadth of the ſaid Road; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration alſo to be had to the Nature of the Ground, or elſe giving them only room for the Road directly, ſhall ſuffer them to Encloſe in any one Spot ſo much of the ſaid Common, as ſhall be equivalent to the like quantity of Land lying by the Road; thus where the Land is good, and the Materials for erecting a Cauſway near, the leſs Land may ſerve; and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the more; but in general, allowing them the quantity of Land propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the length of the Cauſway, and Forty Rod in Breadth, tho' where the Land is poor, as on Downs and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0411500300:105"/>
Plains, the Proportion muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd to be adjuſted by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>Another Point for the Dimenſions of Roads, ſhou'd be adjuſted; and the Breadth of them, I think, cannot be leſs than thus:</p>
               <p>From <hi>London</hi> every way 10 Miles the High Poſt-Road to be Built full 40 Foot in Breadth, and 4 Foot High, the Ditches 8 Foot Broad, and 6 Foot Deep, and from thence onward 30 Foot, and ſo in Proportion.</p>
               <p>Croſs Roads to be 20 Foot Broad, and Ditches Proportion'd; no Lanes and Paſſes leſs than 9 Foot without Ditches.</p>
               <p>The Middle of the High Cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be Pav'd with Stone, Chalk, or Gravel, and kept always Two Foot Higher than the Sides, that the Water might have a free courſe into the Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and Perſons kept in conſtant Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0411500300:106"/>
to fill up Holes, let out Water, open Dreins, and the like, as there ſhou'd be occaſion: A proper Work for Highwaymen, and ſuch Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, as might on thoſe Services be exempt'd from the Gallows.</p>
               <p>It may here be Objected, That Eight Years Aſſeſsment to be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down, is too much in reaſon to expect any of the Poorer ſort can pay; as for Inſtance; If a Farmer who keeps a Team of Horſe be at the common Aſſeſsment, to Work a Week, it muſt not be put ſo hard upon any Man, as to Work Eight Weeks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 'Tis eaſy to Anſwer this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>So many as ate wanted, muſt be had; if a Farmer's Team cannot be ſpar'd without prejudice to him ſo long together, he may ſpare it at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times, or agree to be Aſſeſs'd, and pay the Aſſeſsment at ſundry Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0411500300:107"/>
and the Bank may make it as eaſy to them as they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Another Method, however, might be found to fix this Work at once; As ſuppoſe a Bank be ſettled for the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> which as they are, without doubt, the moſt us'd of any in the Kingdom, ſo alſo they require the more Charge, and in ſome Parts lie in the worſt Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>If the Parliament fix the Charge of the Survey of the High-Ways upon a Bank to be Appointed for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for a certain term of Years, the Bank Undertaking to do the Work, or to Forfeit the ſaid Settlement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As thus:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe the Tax on Land, and Tenements for the whole County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> does, or ſhou'd be ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, as it might amount to 20000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> more or leſs, which it now
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0411500300:108"/>
does, and much more, including the Work of the Farmer's Teams, which muſt be accounted as Money, and is equivalent to it, with ſome Allowance to be Rated for the City of <hi>London, &amp;c.</hi> who do enjoy the Benefit, and make the moſt uſe of the ſaid Roads, both for carrying of Goods, and bringing Proviſions to the City, and therefore in reaſon ought to Contribute towards the High-ways; for it is a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal thing, that the Road from <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> to <hi>Smithfield</hi>-Market, by which the whole City is, in a manner, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd with Live Cattel, and the Road by thoſe Cattel horribly ſpoil'd, ſhou'd lie all upon that one Pariſh of <hi>Iſlington</hi> to Repair; wherefore I'le ſuppoſe a Rate for the High-ways to be gather'd through the City of <hi>London</hi> of 10000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> more; which may be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be paid by Carriers, Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and all ſuch as keep Teams,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0411500300:109"/>
Horſes, or Coaches, and the like, or many ways, as is moſt Equal and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; the waſte Lands in the ſaid County, which by the Conſent of the Pariſhes, Lords of the Mannors, and Proprietors, ſhall be allow'd to the Undertakers when Enclos'd and Let out, may (the Land in <hi>Middleſex</hi> generally Letting high) amount to 5000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> more. If then an Act of Parliament be procur'd to ſettle the Tax of 30000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> for Eight Years, moſt of which will be Levi'd in Workmen, and not in Money, and the Waſte Lands for ever: I dare be bold to offer, That the High-Ways for the whole County of <hi>Middleſex</hi> ſhou'd be put into the following Form, and the 5000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> Land be bound to remain as a Security to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them ſo, and the County be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Burthen'd with any further Tax for the Repair of the High-Ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0411500300:110"/>
And that I may not Propoſe a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in General, like begging the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, without Demonſtration, I ſhall enter into the Particulars, How it may be perform'd, and that under theſe following Heads of Articles.<list>

               <p n="2">(2.) The Second Queſtion I Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to give an Account of, is, What the Charge will be.</p>
               <p>Which I account thus;</p>
               <p>The Work of the great Cauſway I Propoſe, ſhall not Coſt leſs than 10 <hi>s. per</hi> Foot, ſuppoſing Materials to be Bought, Carriage and Mens La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be all Hir'd, which for 67
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0411500300:117"/>
Miles in Length, is no leſs than the Sum of 176880 Pounds; as thus,</p>
               <p>Every Mile accounted at 1760 Yards, and 3 Foot to the Yard, is 5280 Foot, which at 10 <hi>s. per</hi> Foot, is 2640 <hi>l. per</hi> Mile, and that again Multiplied by 67, makes the ſum of 176880, into which I include the Charge of Water-Courſes, Mills to throw off Water where needful, Dreins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Charge muſt be added, Ditching to Encloſe Land for 30 Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and Building 30 Cottages at 40 <hi>l.</hi> each, which is 1200 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Work of the ſmaller Cauſway I Propoſe to finiſh at the Rate of 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Foot, which being for 140 Miles in Length, at 5280 Foot <hi>per</hi> Mile, amounts to 36960 <hi>l.</hi>

               <p>Ditching, Dreining, and Repairing 1000 Miles, ſuppos'd at 3 <hi>s. per</hi> Rod, as for 320000 Rod, is 48000 <hi>l.</hi> which

               <p>If I were to Propoſe ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for the eaſing this Charge, I cou'd, perhaps, lay a Scheme down how it may be perform'd for leſs than one half of this Charge.</p>
               <p>As firſt, By a grant of the Court at the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> whereby all ſuch Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals as are Condemn'd to Die for ſmaller Crimes, may inſtead of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſportation be Order'd a Year's Work on the High-Ways; others inſtead of Whippings, a proportion'd Time, and the like; which wou'd, by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate computation, provide us gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0411500300:119"/>
a ſupply of 200 Workmen, and coming in as faſt as they go off; and let the Overſeers alone to make them Work.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By an Agreement with the <hi>Guinea</hi>-Company to furniſh 200 <hi>Negroes,</hi> who are generally Perſons that do a great deal of Work; and all theſe are Subſiſted very reaſonably out of a Publick Store-houſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By Carts and Horſes to be Bought, not Hir'd, with a few Able Carters; and to the other a few Workmen that have Judgment to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the reſt; and thus I queſtion not the Great Cauſway ſhall be done for 4 <hi>s. per</hi> Foot Charge; but of this by the by.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A Liberty to ask Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and Benevolences to the Work.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) To the Queſtion, How this Money ſhall be Rais'd? I think if the Parliament ſettle the Tax on the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0411500300:120"/>
County for Eight Years, at 30000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> no Man need ask, how it ſhall be Rais'd,—It will be eaſy enough to Raiſe the Money; and no Pariſh can grudge to pay a little larger Rate for ſuch a Term, on condition never to be Tax'd for the High-Ways any more.</p>
               <p>Eight Years Aſſeſsment at 30000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> is enough to afford to Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Money by way of Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if need be, the Fund being ſecur'd by Parliament, and appropriated to that Uſe and no other.</p>
               <p>As to what Security for Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:</p>
               <p>The Lands which are Enclos'd may be appropriated by the ſame Act of Parliament to the Bank and Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, upon condition of Performance, and to be Forfeit to the uſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pariſhes to which they belong, in caſe upon Preſentation by the Grand
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0411500300:121"/>
Juries, and reaſonable Time given, any part of the Roads in ſuch and ſuch Pariſhes, be not kept and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in that Poſture they are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be. Now the Lands thus ſettled are an eternal Security to the Country, for the keeping the Roads in Repair; becauſe they will always be of ſo much Value over the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Charge, as will make it worth while to the Undertakers to preſerve their Title to them; and the Tenure of them being ſo precarious, as to be liable to Forfeiture on Default, they will always be careful to uphold the Cauſways.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, What Profit to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers? For we muſt allow them to Gain, and that conſiderably, or no Man wou'd undertake ſuch a Work.</p>
               <p>To this I propoſe, Firſt,</p>
               <p>During the Work allow them out of the Stock 3000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0411500300:122"/>
After the Work is finiſh'd, ſo much of the 5000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> as can be ſav'd, and the Roads kept in good Repair, let be their own; and if the Lands Secur'd be not of the Value of 5000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, let ſo much of the Eight Years Tax be ſet apart as may Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Land to make them up; if they come to more, let the Benefit be to the Adventurers.</p>
               <p>It may be Objected here, That a Tax of 30000 <hi>l.</hi> for Eight Years will come in as faſt as it can well be laid out, and ſo no Anticipations will be requiſite; for the whole Work Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd cannot be probably finiſhed in leſs Time; and if ſo,

which is 13000 <hi>l.</hi> more than the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0411500300:123"/>
Charge; and if the Work be done ſo much Cheaper, as is mentioned, the Profit to the Undertaker will be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable.</p>
               <p>To this I ſay, I wou'd have the Undertakers bound to accept the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary of 3000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> for Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if a whole Years Tax can be ſpar'd, either leave it Unrais'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Country, or put it in Bank to be improv'd againſt any occaſion, of Building, perhaps, a great <hi>Bridge;</hi> or ſome very wet Seaſon, or Froſt, may ſo Damnify the Works, as to make them require more than ordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. But the Undertakers ſhou'd make no private Advantage of ſuch an Overplus, there might be ways enough found for it.</p>
               <p>Another Objection lies againſt the Poſſibility of Encloſing the Lands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Waſte, which generally belongs
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0411500300:124"/>
to ſome Mannor, whoſe different Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures may be ſo croſs, and ſo other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe encumbred, that even the Lord of thoſe Mannors, though they were willing, cou'd not Convey them.</p>
               <p>This may be Anſwer'd in General, That an Act of Parliament is <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent</hi> with reſpect to Titles and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures of Land, and can Empower Lords and Tenants to Conſent to what elſe they cou'd not; as to Particulars, they cannot be Anſwer'd till they are Propos'd; but there is no doubt but an Act of Parliament may adjuſt it all in one Head.</p>
               <p>What a Kingdom wou'd <hi>England</hi> be if this were perform'd in all the Counties of it! and yet I believe it is feaſible, even in the worſt. I have narrowly obſerv'd all the Conſiderable Ways in that unpaſſable County of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> which eſpecially in ſome parts in the <hi>Wild,</hi> as they very properly call
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0411500300:125"/>
it, of the County, hardly admits the Countrey People to Travel to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets in Winter, and makes Corn dear at Market becauſe it can't be brought, and cheap at the Farmer's Houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he can't carry it to Market; yet even in that County wou'd I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to carry on this Propoſal, and that to great Advantage, if back'd with the Authority of an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen in that horrible Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try the Road 60 to 100 Yards Broad, lie from ſide to ſide all Poach'd with Cattel, the Land of no manner of Benefit, and yet no going with a Horſe, but at every ſtep up to the Shoulders, full of Sloughs and Holes, and covered with ſtanding-water. It coſts them incredible Sums of Money to Repair them; and the very Places that are mended, wou'd fright a young Traveller to go over them: The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0411500300:126"/>
Maſter'd this Work, and by a firm Cauſeway made a High-way quite through this deep Country, through <hi>Darkin</hi> in <hi>Surry</hi> to <hi>Stanſted,</hi> and thence to <hi>Okeley,</hi> and ſo on to <hi>Arundel;</hi> its Name tells us what it was made of; for it was call'd <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> and many viſible parts of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to this day.</p>
               <p>Now would any Lord of a Mannor refuſe to allow 40 Yards in breadth out of that Road I mention'd, to have the other 20 made into a Firm, Fair, and Pleaſant Cauſeway over that Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Countrey?</p>
               <p>Or would not any man acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, That putting this Country into a condition for Carriages and Travellers to paſs, would be a great Work? The Gentlemen would find the Benefit of it in the Rent of their Land, and Price of their Timber; the Countrey Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would find the difference in the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0411500300:127"/>
Sale of their Goods, which now they cannot carry beyond the firſt Market-Town, and hardly thither; and the whole County would reap an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage an hundred to one greater than the Charge of it. And ſince the Want we feel of any Convenience is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the firſt Motive to Contrivance for a Remedy, I wonder no man ever thought of ſome Expedient for ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a Defect.</p>

               <p>ASSURANCES among Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants I believe may plead Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and has been of uſe time out of mind in Trade; tho perhaps never ſo much a Trade as now.</p>
               <p>'Tis a Compact among Merchants. Its beginning being an Accident to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0411500300:128"/>
Trade, and aroſe from the <hi>Diſeaſe of Mens Tempers,</hi> who having run lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Adventures in a ſingle Bottom than afterwards they found convenient, grew fearful and uneaſy; and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their uneaſineſs to others, who, perhaps, had no Effects in the ſame Veſſel, they offer to bear part of the Hazard for part of the Profit; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience made this a Cuſtom, and Cuſtom brought it into a Method, till at laſt it becomes a Trade.</p>
               <p>I cannot queſtion the Lawfulneſs of it, ſince all Riſque in Trade is for Gain; and when I am neceſſitated to have a greater Cargo of Goods in ſuch or ſuch a Bottom, than my Stock can afford to loſe, another may <hi>ſurely</hi> offer to go a Part with me; and as 'tis juſt if I give another part of the Gain, he ſhou'd run part of the Riſque, ſo it is as juſt, that if he runs part of my Riſque, he ſhou'd have part
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0411500300:129"/>
of the Gain. Some Object the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity of the Premio to the Hazard, when the Enſurer runs the Riſque of 100 <hi>l.</hi> on the Seas from <hi>Jamaica</hi> to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> for 40 <hi>s.</hi> which, ſay they, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous and unequal. Though this Objection is hardly worth Anſwering to Men of Buſineſs, yet it looks ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fair to them that know no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and for the Information of ſuch, I trouble the Reader with a few Heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They muſt conſider the Enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer is out no Stock.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is but one Riſque the Enſurer runs, whereas the Aſſured has had a Riſque out, a Riſque of Debts abroad, a Riſque of a Market, and a Riſque of his Factor, and has a Riſque of a Market to come, and therefore ought to have an anſwerable Profit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If it has been a Trading Voyage, perhaps, the Adventurer has Paid Three or Four ſuch Premio's,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0411500300:130"/>
which ſometimes make the Enſurer clear more by a Voyage, than the Merchant; I my ſelf have Paid 100 <hi>l.</hi> Enſurances in thoſe ſmall Premio's on a Voyage I have not gotten 50 <hi>l.</hi> by; and I ſuppoſe I am not the firſt that has done ſo neither.</p>
               <p>This way of Aſſuring has alſo, as other Arts of Trade have, ſuffer'd ſome Improvement (if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd that Term) in our Age; and the firſt ſtep upon it, was an <hi>Enſurance-Office for Houſes to Enſure them from Fire;</hi> Common Fame gives the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Dr. <hi>Barebone;</hi> a Man, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, better known as a Builder than a Phyſician. Whether it were his, or whoſe it was, I do not enquire; it was ſettled on a Fund of Ground-Rents, to Anſwer in caſe of Loſs, and met with very good Acceptance.</p>
               <p>But it was ſoon follow'd by another, by way of <hi>Friendly Society;</hi> where every
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0411500300:131"/>
one who Subſcribe, pay their <hi>Quota</hi> to Build up any Man's Houſe who is a Contributor, if it ſhall happen to be Burnt. I won't decide which is the Beſt, or which Succeeded beſt, but I believe the latter brings in moſt Money to the Contriver.</p>
               <p>Only one Benefit I cannot omit which they reap from theſe Two Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties who are not concern'd in either, That if any Fire happen, whether in Houſes Enſur'd or not Enſur'd, they have each of them a ſet of Luſty Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, generally Water-men, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately call'd up, where-ever they live, by Watchmen Appointed, are, it muſt be confeſs'd, very Active and Diligent in helping to put out the Fire.</p>
               <p>As to any further Improvement to be made upon Aſſurances in Trade, no queſtion there may, and I doubt
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0411500300:132"/>
not but on Payment of a ſmall Duty to the Government, the King might be made the General Enſurer of all Foreign Trade: Of which more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another Head.</p>
               <p>I am of the opinion alſo, that an Office of Enſurance Erected to Enſure the Titles of Lands, in an Age where they are ſo precarious as now, might be a Project not unlikely to ſucceed, if Eſtabliſh'd on a good Fund. But I ſhall ſay no more to that, becauſe it ſeems to be a Deſign in hand by ſome Perſons in Town, and is indeed no Thought of my own.</p>
               <p>Enſuring of Life I cannot admire; I ſhall ſay nothing to it; but that in <hi>Italy</hi> where <hi>Stabbing</hi> and <hi>Poyſoning</hi> is ſo much in Vogue, ſomething may be ſaid for it, and on contingent An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities; and yet I never knew the thing much approv'd of on any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            </div>

               <head>Of FRIENDLY-SOCIETIES.</head>
               <p>ANother Branch of Enſurance, is by Contribution, or (to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Term from that before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd) <hi>Friendly-Societies;</hi> which, is in ſhort, a Number of People entring into a Mutual Compact to Help one another, in caſe any Diſaſter or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs fall upon them.</p>
               <p>If Mankind cou'd agree, as theſe might be Regulated, all things which have Caſualty in them, might be Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd. But one thing is Particularly requir'd in this way of Aſſurances; None can be admitted, but ſuch whoſe Circumſtances are, at leaſt in ſome degree, alike, and ſo Mankind muſt be <hi>ſorted</hi> into Claſſes; and as their Contingences differ, every dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sort may be a Society upon even Terms; for the Circumſtances of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0411500300:134"/>
as to Life, differ extremely by the Age and Conſtitution of their Bodies, and difference of Employment; as he that lives on ſhore, againſt him that goes to Sea, or a Young Man againſt an Old Man; or a Shopkeeper againſt a Soldier, are unequal; I don't pretend to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Controverted Point of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, the Foreknowledge and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Providence; perhaps, if a Man be Decreed to be Kill'd in the Trenches, the ſame Foreknowledge Order'd him to Liſt himſelf a Soldier that it might come to paſs; and the like of a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but this I am ſure, ſpeaking of Second Cauſes, a Seaman or a Soldier is ſubject to more contingent hazards than other Men, and therefore are not upon equal Terms to form ſuch a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; nor is an Annuity on the Life of ſuch a Man worth ſo much as it is upon other Men; therefore if a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety ſhou'd agree together to Pay the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0411500300:135"/>
Executor of every Member ſo much after the Deceaſe of the ſaid Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Seamens Executors wou'd moſt certainly have an Advantage, and receive more than they Pay. So that 'tis neceſſary to ſort the World in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Parcels, Seamen with Seamen, Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with Soldiers, and the like.</p>
               <p>Nor is this a new thing; the <hi>Friendly Society</hi> muſt not pretend to aſſume to themſelves the Contrivance of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, or think us guilty of borrowing from them, when we draw this into other Branches; for I know nothing is taken from them but the bare word, <hi>Friendly-Society,</hi> which they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be any conſiderable piece of Invention neither.</p>
               <p>I can refer them to the very indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Practice in other things, which claims preſcription beyond the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the laſt Age, and that is in our Marſhes and Fens in <hi>Eſſex, Kent,</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0411500300:136"/>
and the <hi>Iſle of Ely;</hi> where great Quantities of Land being with much Pains and a vaſt Charge recovered out of the Seas and Rivers, and maintain'd with Banks (which they call Walls) the Owners of thoſe Lands agree to Contribute to the keeping up thoſe Walls, and keeping out the Sea, which is all one with a <hi>Friendly-Society;</hi> and if I have a Piece of Land in any Level or Marſh, tho' it bounds no where on the Sea or Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet I pay my Proportion to the Maintenance of the ſaid Wall or Bank; and if at any time the Sea breaks in, the Damage is not laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Man in whoſe Land the Breach happened, unleſs it was by his neglect, but it lies on the whole Land, and is called a <hi>Level-Lot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, I have known it practiſed in Troops of Horſe, eſpecially when it was ſo order'd that the Troopers
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0411500300:137"/>
Mounted themſelves; where every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Trooper has agreed to Pay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, 2 <hi>d. per diem</hi> out of his Pay into a Publick Stock, which Stock was employed to Remount any of the Troop who by Accident ſhou'd loſe his Horſe.</p>
               <p>Again, The Sailors Contribution to the Cheſt at <hi>Chatham,</hi> is another <hi>Friendly-Society;</hi> and more might be nam'd.</p>
               <p>To argue againſt the Lawfulneſs of this, wou'd be to cry down common Equity, as well as Charity; for as 'tis kind that my Neighbour ſhou'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me if I fall into Diſtreſs or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay; ſo 'tis but Equal he ſhou'd do ſo if I agreed to have done the ſame for him; and if God Almighty has Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to Relieve and Help one another in Diſtreſs, ſure it muſt be commendable to bind our ſelves by Agreement to Obey that Command;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0411500300:138"/>
nay, it ſeems to be a Project that we are led to by the Divine Rule, and has ſuch a Latitude in it, that, for ought I know, as I ſaid, all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters in the World might be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, and Mankind be ſecur'd from all the Miſeries, Indigences, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes that happen in the World. In which I crave leave to be a little Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>Firſt, General Peace might be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd all over the World by it, if all the Powers agreed to ſuppreſs him that Uſurp'd or Encroach'd upon his Neighbour. All the Contingences of Life might be fenc'd againſt by this Method, (as Fire is already) as Thieves, Floods by Land, Storms by Sea, Loſſes of all Sorts, and Death it ſelf, in a manner, by making it up to the Survivor.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin with the Seamen; for as their Lives are ſubject to more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0411500300:139"/>
than others, they ſeem to come firſt in view.</p>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>Of Seamen.</head>
                  <p>Sailors are <hi>Les Enfans Perdue,</hi> the <hi>Forlorn hope of the World;</hi> they are Fellows that bid Defiance to Terror, and maintain a conſtant War with the Elements; who by the Magick of their Art, Trade in the very confines of Death, and are always poſted within ſhot, as I may ſay, of the Grave: 'Tis true, their familiarity with Danger makes them deſpiſe it, for which, I hope, no body will ſay they are the wiſer; and Cuſtom has ſo harden'd them, that we find them the worſt of Men, tho' always in view of their laſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>I have obſerv'd one great Error in the Cuſtom of <hi>England,</hi> relating
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0411500300:140"/>
to theſe ſort of People, and which this way of <hi>Friendly-Society</hi> wou'd be a Remedy for.</p>
                  <p>If a Seaman who Enters himſelf, or is Preſs'd into the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, be by any Accident Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or Diſabled, to Recompence him for the Loſs, he receives a Penſion during Life, which the Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors call <hi>Smart-Money,</hi> and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to their Hurt, as for the Loſs of an Eye, Arm, Leg, or Finger, and the like; and as 'tis a very Honourable thing, ſo 'tis but reaſonable, That a Poor Man who Loſes his Limbs (which are his Eſtate) in the Service of the Government, and is thereby diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled from his Labour to get his Bread, ſhou'd be provided for, and not ſuffer'd to Beg or Starve for want of thoſe Limbs he loſt in the Service of his Country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0411500300:141"/>
But if you come to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Merchants Service, not the leaſt Proviſion is made; which has been the Loſs of many a good Ship, with many a Rich Cargo, which wou'd otherwiſe have been Sav'd.</p>
                  <p>And the Sailors are in the Right of it too: <hi>For Inſtance;</hi> A Merchant Ship coming home from the <hi>Indies,</hi> perhaps very Rich, meets with a Privateer (not ſo Strong but that She might Fight him, and perhaps get off); the Captain calls up his Crew, tells them, <hi>Gentlemen, You ſee how 'tis, I don't queſtion but we may Clear our ſelves of this Caper, if you will Stand by Me.</hi> One of the Crew, as willing to Fight as the reſt, and as far from a Coward as the Captain, but endow'd with a little more Wit than his Fellows, Replies, <hi>Noble Captain, We are all willing to Fight, and don't queſtion but to Beat him</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0411500300:142"/>
                     <hi>off; but here is the Caſe, If we are Taken, we ſhall be ſet on Shore, and then ſent Home, and Loſe, perhaps, our Cloaths, and a little Pay; but if we Fight and Beat the Privateer, perhaps Half a Score of us may be Wounded and Loſe our Limbs, and then we are Undone and our Families; if you will Sign an Obligation to us, That the Owners, or Merchants, ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Penſion to ſuch as are Maim'd, that we may not Fight for the Ship, and go a Begging our ſelves, we will bring off the Ship, or Sink by her ſide, otherwiſe I am not willing to Fight, for my part.</hi> The Captain cannot do this; ſo they Strike, and the Ship and Cargo is Loſt.</p>
                  <p>If I ſhou'd turn this ſuppos'd Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample into a real Hiſtory, and Name the Ship and the Captain that did ſo, it wou'd be too plain to be contradicted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0411500300:143"/>
Wherefore, for the Encouragement of Sailors in the Service of the Merchant, I wou'd have a <hi>Friendly-Society</hi> Erected for Seamen; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all Sailors, or Seafaring-men, Entring their Names, Places of Abode, and the Voyages they go upon, at an <hi>Office of Enſurance for Seamen,</hi> and Paying there a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſmall Quarteridge, of 1 <hi>s. per</hi> Quarter, ſhou'd have a Seal'd Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate from the Governors of the ſaid Office, for the Articles hereafter mentioned.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) If any ſuch Seaman, either in Fight, or by any other Accident at Sea, come to be diſabled, he ſhou'd receive from the ſaid Office the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sums of Money, either in Penſion for Life, or Ready Money, as he pleas'd.

                  <p>In Conſideration of this, every Woman ſo Subſcribing, Obliges her ſelf to Pay as often as any Member of the Society becomes a Widow, the due Proportion or Share allotted to her to Pay, towards the 500 <hi>l.</hi> for the ſaid Widow, provided her Share does not exceed the Sum of 5 <hi>s.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>One grand Objection againſt this Propoſal, is, How you will oblige People to Pay either their Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or their Quarteridge.</p>
                  <p>To this I Anſwer, <hi>By no compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> (tho' that might be perform'd too) but altogether voluntary; only with this Argument to move it, that if they do not continue their Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they loſe the Benefit of their paſt Contributions.</p>
                  <p>I know it lies as a fair Objection againſt ſuch a Project as this, That the number of Claims are ſo uncertain, That no Body knows what they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in, when they Subſcribe, for ſo many may Die Annually out of Two thouſand, as may make my Payment 20 or 25 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> and if a Woman
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0411500300:153"/>
happen to Pay that for Twenty Years, though ſhe receives the 500 <hi>l.</hi> at laſt ſhe is a great Loſer; but if ſhe dies before her Husband, ſhe has leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened his Eſtate conſiderably, and brought a great Loſs upon him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſay to this, That I wou'd have ſuch a Propoſal as this be ſo fair and ſo eaſy, that if any Perſon who had Subſcrib'd, found the Payments too high, and the Claims fall too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, it ſhou'd be at their liberty at any time, upon Notice given, to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed, and ſtand Oblig'd no longer; and if ſo, <hi>Volenti non fit injuria;</hi> every one knows beſt what their own Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances will bear.</p>
                  <p>In the next Place, becauſe Death is a Contingency, no Man can directly calculate, and all that Subſcribe muſt take the hazard; yet that a Prejudice againſt this Notion may not be built on wrong grounds, let's examine a little the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0411500300:154"/>
probable hazard, and ſee how many ſhall die Annually out of 2000 Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers, accounting by the common proportion of Burials, to the number of the Living.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>William Petty</hi> in his <hi>Political Arithmetick,</hi> by a very Ingenious Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, brings the account of Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als in <hi>London,</hi> to be 1 in 40 Annually, and proves it by all the proper Rules of proportion'd Computation; and I'le take my Scheme from thence.</p>
                  <p>If then One in Forty of all the People in <hi>England</hi> Die, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Fifty to Die every Year out of our Two Thouſand Subſcribers; and for a Woman to Contribute 5 <hi>s.</hi> to every one, wou'd certainly be to Agree to Pay 12 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s. per Ann.</hi> upon her Husband's Life, to receive 500 <hi>l.</hi> when he Di'd, and loſe it if ſhe Di'd firſt; and yet this wou'd not be a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard beyond reaſon too great for the Gain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0411500300:155"/>
But I ſhall offer ſome Reaſons to prove this to be impoſſible in our Caſe; Firſt, Sir <hi>William Petty</hi> allows the City of <hi>London</hi> to contain about a Million of People, and our Yearly Bill of Mortality never yet amounted to 25000 in the moſt Sickly Years we have had, Plague Years excepted, ſometimes but to 20000, which is but One in Fifty: Now it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd here, that Children and Ancient People make up, one time with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at leaſt one third of our Bills of Mortality; and our <hi>Aſſurances</hi> lies upon none but the Midling Age of the People, which is the only Age wherein Life is any thing ſteady; and if that be allow'd, there cannot Die by his Computation, above One in Eighty of ſuch People every Year; but becauſe I wou'd be ſure to leave room for Caſualty, I'le allow One in Fifty ſhall Die out of our Number Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0411500300:156"/>
Secondly, It muſt be allow'd, that our Payments falling due only on the Death of Husbands, this One in Fifty muſt not be reckoned upon the Two thouſand; for 'tis to be ſuppos'd at leaſt as many Women ſhall Die as Men, and then there is nothing to Pay; ſo that One in Fifty upon One Thouſand, is the moſt that I can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhall Claim the Contribution in a Year, which is Twenty Claims a Year, at 5 <hi>s.</hi> each, and is 5 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> and if a Woman Pays this for Twenty Year, and Claims at laſt, ſhe is Gainer enough, and no extraordinary Loſer if ſhe never Claims at all: And I verily believe any Office might Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to Demand at all Adventures not above 6 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> and ſecure the Subſcriber 500 <hi>l.</hi> in caſe ſhe come to Claim as a Widow.</p>
                  <p>I forbear being more particular on this Thought, having occaſion to be
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0411500300:157"/>
larger in other Prints; the Experiment being reſolv'd upon by ſome Friends, who are pleas'd to think this too uſeful a Project not to be put in execution; and therefore I refer the Reader to the Publick Practice of it.</p>
                  <p>I have nam'd theſe two Caſes as ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Experiments of what might be done by Aſſurances in way of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Society;</hi> and I believe I might without Arrogance affirm, That the ſame Thought might be improv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Methods that ſhou'd prevent the General Miſery and Poverty of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and at once ſecure us againſt Beggars, Pariſh-Poor, Alms-Houſes, and Hoſpitals; and by which, not a Creature ſo Miſerable, or ſo Poor, but ſhould claim Subſiſtence as their Due, and not ask it of Charity.</p>
                  <p>I cannot believe any Creature ſo wretchedly baſe, as to Beg of mere
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0411500300:158"/>
choice, but either it muſt proceed from Want, or ſordid prodigious Covetouſneſs; and thence I affirm, There can be no <hi>Beggar,</hi> but he ought to be either Reliev'd, or Puniſh'd, or both. If a man begs for mere Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, without Want, 'tis a baſeneſs of Soul ſo extremely ſordid, as ought to be us'd with the utmoſt Contempt, and puniſh'd with the Correction due to a Dog. If he begs for Want, that Want is procur'd by Slothfulneſs and Idleneſs, or by Accident; if the latter, he ought to be reliev'd; if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he ought to be puniſh'd for the Cauſe, but at the ſame time reliev'd alſo; for no man ought to ſtarve, let his Crime be what it will.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall proceed therefore to a Scheme, by which all Mankind, be he never ſo mean, ſo poor, ſo unable, ſhall gain for himſelf a Juſt Claim to a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Subſiſtence, whenſoever Age or
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0411500300:159"/>
Caſualty ſhall reduce him to a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of making uſe of it. There is a Poverty ſo far from being Deſpicable, that 'tis Honourable, when a man by direct Caſualty, ſudden Providence, and without any procuring of his own, is reduc'd to want Relief from others, as by Fire, Shipwreck, Loſs of Limbs, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are ſometimes ſo apparent, that they command the Charity of others; but there are alſo many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies reduc'd to Decay, whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are not ſo publick, and yet their Neceſſities as great. Innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Circumſtances reduce men to want; and preſſing Poverty oblige ſome people to make their Caſes pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, or ſtarve; and from thence came the Cuſtom of Begging, which Sloth and Idleneſs has improv'd into a Trade. But the Method I propoſe, thoroughly put in practice, would remove the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0411500300:160"/>
Cauſe, and the Effect wou'd ceaſe of courſe.</p>
                  <p>Want of Conſideration is the great reaſon why People do not provide in their Youth and Strength for Old Age and Sickneſs; and the enſuing Propoſal is, in ſhort, only this, That all Perſons in the time of their Health and Youth, while they are able to Work and ſpare it, ſhou'd lay up ſome ſmall inconſiderable part of their gettings as a depoſit in ſafe hands, to lie as a Store in bank to relieve them, if by Age or Accident they come to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, or uncapable to Provide for themſelves; and that if God ſo Bleſs them, that they nor theirs never come to need it, the overplus may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to relieve ſuch as ſhall.</p>
                  <p>If an Office in the ſame nature with this, were appointed in every
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0411500300:161"/>
County in <hi>England,</hi> I doubt not but Poverty might eaſily be prevented, and Begging wholly ſuppres'd.</p>

                     <hi>It is to be Noted, That in the</hi> 4th. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle ſuch as by Sickneſs and Age are diſabled from Work, and Poor, ſhall be taken into the Houſe and provided for; whereas in the</hi> 3d. <hi>Article, they who are Blind, or have loſt Limbs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall have Penſions allow'd them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon of this difference is this:</p>
                  <p>A Poor Man or Woman that has loſt his Hand, or Leg, or Sight, is viſibly diſabled, and we cannot be deceiv'd, whereas other Infirmities are not ſo eaſily judg'd of, and every body
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0411500300:165"/>
wou'd be claiming a Penſion, when but few will demand being taken into an Hoſpital but ſuch as are really in want.</p>
                  <p>And that this might be manag'd with ſuch Care and Candor as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign which carries ſo good a face ought to be, I Propoſe the following Method for putting it in Practice.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe every Undertaking of ſuch a magnitude muſt have ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Agent to puſh it forward, who muſt manage and direct every thing <hi>always</hi> with direction of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, I'le ſuppoſe One Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Office erected for the great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes of <hi>Stepney</hi> and <hi>Whitechappel;</hi> and as I'le lay down afterwards ſome Methods to oblige all People to come in and Subſcribe, ſo I may be allow'd to ſuppoſe here, That all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants

of thoſe Two large Pariſhes (the meaner Labouring ſort I mean) ſhou'd Enter their Names, and that the number of them ſhou'd be a 100000, as I believe they wou'd be at leaſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There ſhou'd be Nam'd 50 of the principal Inhabitants of the ſaid Pariſhes (of which the Church-Wardens for the time being, and all the Juſtices of the Peace dwelling in the bounds of the ſaid Pariſh, and the Miniſters reſident for the time being, to be part) to be Governors of the ſaid Office.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid 50 to be firſt Nominated by the Lord-Mayor of <hi>London</hi> for the time being, and every Vacancy to be ſuppli'd in 10 days at fartheſt, by the Majority of Voices of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The 50 to chuſe a Committee of 11, to ſit twice a week, of whom 3 to

be a <hi>Quorum;</hi> with a Chief Governor, a Deputy-Governor, and a Treaſurer.</p>
                  <p>In the Office, a Secretary with Clerks of his own, a Regiſter, and 2 Clerks, 4 Searchers, a Meſſenger, one in daily attendance under Salary, a Phyſician, a Surgeon, and 4 Viſitors.</p>
                  <p>In the Hoſpital, more or leſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Number of People enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, a Houſekeeper, a Steward, Nurſes, a Porter, and a Chaplain.</p>
                  <p>For the Support of this Office, and that the depoſite Money might go to none but the Perſons and Uſes for whom it is paid, and that it might not be ſaid Officers and Salaries was the chief end of the Undertaking, <hi>as in many a Project it has been;</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, That the Manager, or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, who I mention'd before, be the Secretary, who ſhall have a Clerk allow'd him, whoſe buſineſs it ſhall be to keep the Regiſter, take the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0411500300:168"/>
and give out the Tickets Seal'd by the Governors, and Sign'd by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to Enter always the Payment of Quarteridge of every Subſcriber. And that there may be no Fraud or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance, and too great Truſt be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in the ſaid Secretary, every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriber who brings his Quarteridge, is to put it into a great Cheſt, lockt up with 11 Locks, every Member of the Committee to keep a Key, ſo that it cannot be open'd but in the Preſence of them all; and every time a Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber pays his Quarteridge, the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſhall give him a Seal'd Ticket, thus <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> 96 which ſhall be allow'd as the Receipt of Quarteridge for that Quarter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note, The reaſon why every Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhall take a Receipt or Ticket for his Quarteridge, is becauſe this muſt be the ſtanding Law of the</hi>

                     <hi>Office, that if any Subſcriber fail to pay their Quarteridge, they ſhall never Claim after it, until double ſo much be paid, nor not at all that Quarter, whatever befalls them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Secretary ſhou'd be allow'd to have 2 <hi>d.</hi> for every Ticket of Entry he gives out, and 1 <hi>d.</hi> for every Receipt he gives for Quarteridge, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for as follows:<list>

                  <p>As to the Calculation being made on a vaſt Number of Subſcribers, and more than, perhaps, will be allow'd likely to Subſcribe, I think the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion may hold good in a few, as well as in a great many; and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, if 20000 Subſcrib'd, it might be as effectual; I am indeed willing to think all Men ſhou'd have ſenſe enough to ſee the uſefulneſs of ſuch a Deſign, and be perſwaded by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to engage in it; but ſome Men have leſs Prudence than Brutes, and will make no proviſion againſt Age till it comes; and to deal with ſuch, Two ways might be us'd by Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Compel them.<list>
                        <item>(1.) The Church-Wardens and Juſtices of Peace ſhou'd ſend the Beadle of the Pariſh, with an Officer belonging to this Office, about to the

Poorer Pariſhioners to tell them, That ſince ſuch Honourable Proviſion is made for them to ſecure themſelves in Old Age from Poverty and Diſtreſs, they ſhou'd expect no Relief from the Pariſh, if they refus'd to Enter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and by ſparing ſo ſmall a part of their Earnings to prevent future Miſery.</item>
                        <item>(2.) The Church-Wardens of every Pariſh might refuſe the removal of Perſons and Families into their Pariſh but upon their having Entred into this Office.</item>
                        <item>(3.) All Perſons ſhou'd be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly deſir'd to forbear giving any thing to Beggars; and all common Beggars ſuppreſs'd after a certain time; for this wou'd effectually ſuppreſs Beggery at laſt.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>And to oblige the Pariſhes to do this on behalf of ſuch a Project, the Governor of the Houſe ſhou'd ſecure

the Pariſh againſt all Charges coming upon them from any Perſon who did Subſcribe and pay the Quarteridge, and that wou'd moſt certainly oblige any Pariſh to endeavour that all the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Meaner People in the Pariſh ſhou'd enter their Names; for in time 'twou'd moſt certainly take all the Poor in the Pariſh off of their hands.</p>
                  <p>I know that by Law no Pariſh can refuſe to Relieve any Perſon or Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fallen into Diſtreſs, and therefore to ſend them word they muſt expect no Relief, wou'd ſeem a vain threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but thus far the Pariſh may do, they ſhall be eſteem'd as Perſons who deſerve no Relief, and ſhall be us'd accordingly; For who, indeed, wou'd ever pity that Man in his Diſtreſs, who at the expence of <hi>Two Pots of Beer a Month,</hi> might have prevented it, and wou'd not ſpare it?</p>
                  <p>As to my Calculations, on which I
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0411500300:185"/>
do not depend neither, I ſay this, if they are probable, and that in Five years time a Subſcription of a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Perſons wou'd have 87537 <hi>l.</hi> 19 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> in Caſh, all Charges paid, I deſire any one but to reflect what will not ſuch a Sum do; <hi>for inſtance,</hi> were it laid out in the Million Lottery Tickets, which are now Sold at 6 <hi>l.</hi> each, and bring in 1 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> for Fifteen Years, every 1000 <hi>l.</hi> ſo laid out, pays back in time 2500 <hi>l.</hi> and that time wou'd be as faſt as it wou'd be wanted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be as good as Money; or if laid out in improving Rents, as Ground-Rents with Buildings to devolve in time, there is no queſtion but a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue wou'd be rais'd in time to Maintain One third part of the Number of Subſcribers, if they ſhou'd come to Claim Charity.</p>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0411500300:187"/>
ſhifting ſides, and the War providing proper ſubjects, as the contingences of Sieges, Battles, Treaties, and Campaigns, it encreas'd to an extraordinary Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and Offices were erected on purpoſe which manag'd it to a ſtrange degree and with great Advantage, eſpecially to the Office-keepers; ſo that as has been computed, there was not leſs Gaged on one ſide and other upon the ſecond Siege of <hi>Limerick,</hi> than Two hundred thouſand Pound.</p>
               <p>How 'tis manag'd, and by what trick and artifice it became a Trade, and how inſenſibly Men were drawn into it, an eaſy Account may be given.</p>
               <p>I believe <hi>Novelty</hi> was the firſt wheel that ſet it on work, and I need make no reflection upon the power of that Charm: It was wholly a new thing, at leaſt upon the <hi>Exchange</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> and the firſt occaſion that gave
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0411500300:188"/>
it a room among publick Diſcourſe, was ſome Perſons forming Wagers on the Return and Succeſs of King <hi>James,</hi> for which the Government took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to uſe them as they deſerv'd.</p>
               <p>I <hi>have</hi> heard a Bookſeller in King <hi>James</hi>'s time ſay, <hi>That if he wou'd have a Book ſell, he wou'd have it Burnt by the hand of the Common Hangman;</hi> the Man, no doubt, valu'd his Profit above his Reputation; but People are ſo addicted to proſecute a thing that ſeems forbid, that this very practice ſeem'd to be encourag'd by its being <hi>Contraband.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Trade encreas'd, and firſt on the <hi>Exchange</hi> and then in Coffee-houſes it got life, till the Brokers, <hi>thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min of Trade,</hi> got hold of it, and then particular Offices were ſet apart for it, and an incredible reſort thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was to be ſeen every day.</p>
               <p>Theſe Offices had not been long in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0411500300:189"/>
being, but they were throng'd with <hi>Sharpers</hi> and <hi>Setters</hi> as much as the Groom-Porter's, or any Gaming-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in Town, where a Man had nothing to do, but to make a good Figure and prepare the Keeper of the Office to give him a Credit as a good Man, and though he had not a Groat to pay, he ſhou'd take Guineas and ſign Polities, till he had receiv'd, perhaps 3 or 400 <hi>l.</hi> in Money on condition to pay great Odds, and then Succeſs tries the Man; if he Wins, his Fortune is made; if not, he's a better Man than he was before, by juſt ſo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for as to the Debt, he is your Humble Servant in the <hi>Temple</hi> or <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides thoſe who are but the Thieves of the Trade, there is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod as effectual to get Money as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, manag'd with more appearing Honeſty, but no leſs Art, by which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0411500300:190"/>
the Wagerer, in Confederacy with the Office-keeper, ſhall lay vaſt Sums, great Odds, and yet be always ſure to Win.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For Example:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Town in <hi>Flanders,</hi> or elſewhere, during the War is beſieg'd; perhaps at the beginning of the Siege the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is vigorous, and Relief probable, and it is the opinion of moſt people, the Town will hold out <hi>ſo long,</hi> or perhaps not be taken at all: The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerer has two or three more of his fort in conjunction, of which always the Office-keeper is one; and they run down all diſcourſe of the taking the Town, and offer great Odds it ſhall not be taken by ſuch a day: Perhaps this goes on a Week, and then the Scale turns; and tho' they ſeem to hold the ſame opinion ſtill, yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand the Office-keeper has Orders to Take all the Odds which by their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0411500300:191"/>
was before given, againſt the taking the Town; and ſo all their firſt-given Odds are eaſily ſecur'd, and yet the people brought into a vein of Betting againſt the Siege of the Town too. Then they order all the Odds to be Taken as long as they will run, while they themſelves openly give Odds, and ſign Polities, <hi>and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times take their own Money,</hi> till they have receiv'd perhaps double what they at firſt laid. Then they turn the Scale at once, and cry down the Town, and lay that it ſhall be taken, till the length of the firſt Odds is fully run; and by this Manage, if the Town be taken they win perhaps Two or Three Thouſand Pounds, and if it be not taken, they are no Loſers neither.</p>
               <p>'Tis viſible by experience, not one Town in ten is beſieg'd, but 'tis taken. The Art of War is ſo improv'd, and our Generals are ſo wary, that an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0411500300:192"/>
ſeldom attempts a Siege, but when they are almoſt ſure to go on with it; and no Town can hold out, if a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief cannot be had from abroad.</p>
               <p>Now if I can by firſt laying 500 <hi>l.</hi> to 200 <hi>l.</hi> with <hi>A,</hi> that the Town ſhall not be taken, wheedle in <hi>B</hi> to lay me 5000 <hi>l.</hi> to 2000 <hi>l.</hi> of the ſame; and after that, by bringing down the Vogue of the Siege, reduce the Wagers to Even-hand, and lay 2000 <hi>l.</hi> with <hi>C</hi> that the Town ſhall not be taken; by this Method, 'tis plain,<list>
                     <item>If the Town be not Taken, I win 2200 <hi>l.</hi> and loſe 2000 <hi>l.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>If the Town be Taken, I win 5000 <hi>l.</hi> and loſe 2500 <hi>l.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>This is Gaming by Rule, and in ſuch a Knot 'tis impoſſible to loſe; for if it is in any Man's or Company of Men's power, by any Artifice to alter
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0411500300:193"/>
the Odds, 'tis in their power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Money out of every man's Pocket, who has no more Wit than to venture.</p>

Here I ſuppoſe 1500 Pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> Revenue, to be ſettl'd upon the Houſe, which 'tis very probable might be rais'd from the Tax afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. But ſince an Act of Parliament is neceſſary to be had for the Collecting this Duty, <hi>and that Taxes for keeping of Fools would be difficultly obtain'd, while they are ſo much wanted for Wiſe Men;</hi> I would propoſe to raiſe the Money by voluntary Charity, which wou'd be a Work would leave more Honour to the Undertakers, than Feaſts and great Shows, which our Publick Bodies too much diminiſh their Stocks with.</p>
               <p>But to paſs all ſuppoſitious ways, which are eaſily thought of, but hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procur'd; I propoſe to maintain Fools out of our own Folly: And whereas a great deal of Money has been thrown about in Lotteries, the following Propoſal would very eaſily perfect our Work.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>That a Lottery be ſet up by the Authority of the Lord-Mayor and Court of Aldermen, for a Hundred thouſand Tickets, at Twenty Shillings each, to be drawn by the known Way and Method of drawing Lotteries, as the Million-Lottery was drawn; in which no Allowance to be made to any body; but the Fortunate to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the full Sum of One hundred thouſand Pounds put in, without Diſcount; and yet this double Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to follow:<list>
                     <item>(1.) That an immediate Sum of One hundred thouſand Pounds ſhall be rais'd and paid into the <hi>Exchequer</hi> for the Publick Uſe.</item>
                     <item>(2.) A Sum of above Twenty thouſand Pounds be gain'd, to be put into the hands of known Truſtees, to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0411500300:201"/>
be laid out in a Charity for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Poor.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>That as ſoon as the Money ſhall be come in, it ſhall be paid into the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi> either on ſome good Fund, if any ſuitable, or on the Credit of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer;</hi> and that when the Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is drawn, the Fortunate to receive Tallies or Bills from the <hi>Exchequer</hi> for their Money, payable at Four Years.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Exchequer</hi> receives this Money, and gives out Tallies according to the Prizes, when 'tis drawn, all payable at Four Years; and the Intereſt of this Money for Four Years is ſtruck in Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies proportion'd to the time, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Truſtees; which is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit I propoſe for the Work.</p>
               <p>Thus the Fortunate have an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Title to their Prizes, at Four Years, without Intereſt; and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital will have alſo an immediate Title to 6000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> for Four
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0411500300:202"/>
Years, which is the Intereſt at 6 <hi>per Cent. per Ann.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any ſhould object againſt the Time of ſtaying for their Prizes, it ſhould be anſwer'd thus, That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever did not like to ſtay the Time for the Money, upon diſcounting Four Years Intereſt at 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> ſhould have their Money down.</p>
               <p>I think this Specimen will inform any body what might be done by Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, were they not hackney'd about in Private Hands, who by Fraud and Ill Management put them out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and ſo neither gain themſelves, nor ſuffer any uſeful handſome Deſign to ſucceed.</p>
               <p>'Twould be needleſs, I ſuppoſe, to mention, That ſuch a Propoſal as this ought to be ſet on foot by Publick Approbation, and by Men of known Integrity and Eſtates, that there may be no room left for a ſuſpicion of private advantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0411500300:203"/>
If this or any equivalent Propoſal ſucceeded to raiſe the Money, I would have the Houſe eſtabliſh'd as aforeſaid, with larger or ſmaller Revenues, as neceſſity oblig'd; then the Perſons to be receiv'd ſhould be without diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or reſpect, but principally ſuch as were really Poor and Friendleſs; and any that were kept already by any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Collection, the ſaid Pariſh ſhould allow Forty Shillings Yearly towards their Maintenance; which no Pariſh would refuſe that ſubſiſted them whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before.</p>
               <p>I make no queſtion but that if ſuch an Hoſpital was erected within a Mile or two of the City, one great Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance would happen, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the common ſort of people, who are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much addicted to rambling in the Fields, would make this Houſe the cuſtomary Walk, to divert themſelves with the Objects to be ſeen there, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0411500300:204"/>
to make what they call Sport with the Calamity of others; as is now ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully allow'd in <hi>Bedlam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To prevent this, and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſuch, which deſerves Pity, not Contempt, might not be the more expos'd by this Charity, it ſhould be order'd, That the Steward of the Houſe be in Commiſſion of the Peace within the Precincts of the Houſe only, and authoriz'd to puniſh by limited Fines, or otherwiſe, any perſon that ſhall offer any Abuſe to the poor Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people, or ſhall offer to make Sport at their Condition.</p>
               <p>If any perſon at Reading of this, ſhou'd be ſo impertinent as to ask, To what purpoſe I wou'd appoint a Chaplain in an Hoſpital of <hi>Fools?</hi> I could anſwer him very well, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, For the uſe of the other Perſons, Officers and Attendants in the Houſe.</p>

                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0411500300:205"/>
But beſides that, Pray, <hi>Why not a Chaplain for Fools, as well as for Knaves,</hi> ſince both, tho' in a different manner, are uncapable of reaping any benefit by Religion, unleſs by ſome inviſible Influence they are made do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible; and ſince the ſame Secret Power can reſtore theſe to their Reaſon, as muſt make the other Senſible; Pray, Why not a Chaplain? Ideots indeed were denied the Communion in the Primitive Churches, but I never read they were not to be pray'd for, or were not admitted to hear.</p>
               <p>If we allow any Religion, and a Divine Supreme Power, whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence works inviſibly on the hearts of men (<hi>as he muſt be worſe than the people we talk of, who denies it</hi>), we muſt allow at the ſame time, <hi>that Power</hi> can reſtore the Reaſoning-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to an Ideot; and 'tis our part to uſe the proper means of ſupplicating

Heaven to that end, leaving the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing-part to the Iſſue of unalterable Providence.</p>
               <p>The Wiſdom of Providence has not left us without Examples of ſome of the moſt ſtupid Natural Ideots in the world, who have been reſtor'd to their Reaſon, or as one would think, had Reaſon infus'd after a long Life of <hi>Ideotiſm;</hi> Perhaps, among other wiſe ends, to confute that ſordid Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That Ideots have no Souls.</p>

If I may be allow'd ſo much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty with our Laws, which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good, and above all things are temper'd with Mercy, Lenity, and Freedom, This has ſomething in it of Barbarity; it gives a looſe to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Revenge of the Creditor, as well as a Power to right himſelf, while it leaves the Debtor no way to ſhow himſelf honeſt: It contrives all the ways poſſible to drive the Debtor to deſpair, and encourages no new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, for it makes him perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any thing but <hi>ſtarving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Law, eſpecially as it is now frequently executed, tends wholly to the Deſtruction of the Debtor, and yet very little to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Creditor.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The Severities to the Debtor are unreaſonable, and, if I may ſo ſay, a little inhuman; for it not only ſtrips him of all in a moment, but
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0411500300:208"/>
renders him for ever incapable of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, or relieving his Family by future Induſtry. If he 'ſcapes from Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is hardly done too, if he has nothing left, he muſt ſtarve, or live on Charity; if he goes to work, no man dare pay him his Wages, but he ſhall pay it again to the Creditors; if he has any private Stock left for a Subſiſtence, he can put it no where; every man is bound to be a Thief, and take it from him: If he truſts it in the hands of a Friend, he muſt receive it again as a great Courteſy, for that Friend is liable to account for it. I have known a poor man proſecuted by a Statute to that degree, that all he had left was a little Money, which he knew not where to hide; at laſt, that he might not ſtarve, he gives it to his Brother, who had entertain'd him; the Brother, after he had his Money, quarrels with him to get him out of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0411500300:209"/>
his Houſe; and when he deſires him to let him have the Money lent him, gives him this for Anſwer, <hi>I cannot pay you ſafely, for there is a Statute againſt you;</hi> which run the poor man to ſuch Extremities, that he deſtroy'd himſelf. Nothing is more frequent, than for men who are reduc'd by Miſcarriage in Trade, to Compound and Set up again, and get good Eſtates; but a <hi>Statute,</hi> as we call it, for ever ſhuts up all doors to the Debtor's Recovery; as if Breaking were a Crime ſo Capital, that he ought to be caſt out of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Society, and expos'd to Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties worſe than Death. And, which will further expoſe the fruitleſs Severity of this Law, 'tis eaſy to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, That all this Cruelty to the Debtor is ſo far (generally ſpeaking) from advantaging the Creditors, that it deſtroys the Eſtate, conſumes it in extravagant Charges, and unleſs the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0411500300:210"/>
Debtor be conſenting, ſeldom makes any conſiderable Dividends. And I am bold to ſay, There is no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage made by the proſecuting of a Statute with Severity, but what might be doubly made by Methods more merciful. And tho' I am not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the Legiſlators of the Nation, yet by way of Eſſay I take leave to give my Opinion and my Experience in the Methods, Conſequences, and Remedies of this Law.</p>
               <p>All people know, who remember any thing of the Times when that Law was made, that the Evil it was point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, was grown very rank, and Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to defraud Creditors ſo much a Trade, that the Parliament had good reaſon to ſet up a Fury to deal with it; and I am far from reflecting on the Makers of that Law, who, no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſaw 'twas neceſſary at that time: But as Laws, tho' in themſelves good,

(2.) Whether the Extremities of this Law are not often carried on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the true Intent and Meaning of the Act it ſelf, by Perſons, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0411500300:212"/>
being Creditors, are alſo Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and gratify their private Revenge, by proſecuting the Offender, to the Ruin of his Family.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>If theſe Two Points are to be prov'd, then I am ſure 'twill follow, That this Act is now a Publick Grievance to the Nation; and I doubt not but will be one time or other repeal'd by the ſame Wiſe Authority which made it.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Time and Experience has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd the Debtors with Ways and Means to evade the Force of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and to ſecure their Eſtate againſt the reach of it; which renders it often inſignificant, and conſequently, the Knave, againſt whom the Law was particularly bent, gets off; while he only who fails of mere Neceſſity, and whoſe honeſt Principle will not permit him to practice thoſe Methods, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Fury of this Act: And as things are now order'd, nothing is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0411500300:213"/>
more eaſy, than for a man to order his Eſtate ſo, that a Statute ſhall have no power over it, or at leaſt but a little.</p>
               <p>If the Bankrupt be a Merchant, no Statute can reach his Effects beyond the Seas; ſo that he has nothing to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure but his Books, and away he goes into the <hi>Friars.</hi> If a Shopkeeper, he has more difficulty; but that is made eaſy, for there are Men (and Carts) to be had, <hi>whoſe Trade it is,</hi> and who in One Night ſhall remove the greateſt Warehouſe of Goods, or Cellar of Wines in the Town, and carry them off into thoſe Nurſeries of Rogues, the <hi>Mint</hi> and <hi>Friars;</hi> and our Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Watch, who are the allow'd-Magiſtrates of the Night, and who ſhall ſtop a poor little lurking Thief, that it may be has ſtole a bundle of old Cloaths, worth 5 <hi>s.</hi> ſhall let them all paſs without any diſturbance, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0411500300:214"/>
fee a hundred honeſt men robb'd of their Eſtates before their faces, to the Eternal Infamy of the Juſtice of the Nation.</p>
               <p>And were a man but to hear the Diſcourſe among the Inhabitants of thoſe Dens of Thieves, when they firſt ſwarm about a New Comer, to comfort him; for they are not all harden'd to a like degree at once.—Well, ſays the firſt, <hi>Come, don't be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, you have got a good Parcel of Goods away, I promiſe you; you need not value all the World. Ah! wou'd I had done ſo,</hi> ſays another, <hi>I'de a laugh'd at all my Creditors. Ay,</hi> ſays the young Proficient in the harden'd Trade, <hi>but my Creditors! Damn the Creditors,</hi> ſays a Third, <hi>Why, there's ſuch a one and ſuch a one, they have Creditors too, and they won't agree with them, and here they live like Gentlemen, and care not a farthing for them. Offer your Creditors Half a</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0411500300:215"/>
                  <hi>Crown in the Pound, and pay it them in Old Debts, and if they won't take it, let them alone, they'll come after you, never fear it. O! But a Statute,</hi> ſays he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. <hi>O! But the Devil,</hi> cries the Minter. <hi>Why, 'tis the Statutes we live by,</hi> ſay they: <hi>Why, if 'twere not for Statutes, Creditors would comply, and Debtors wou'd compound, and We Honeſt Fellows here of the Mint wou'd be ſtarv'd. Prithee, What need you care for a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute? A Thouſand Statutes can't reach you here.</hi> This is the <hi>Language of the Countrey,</hi> and the New Comer ſoon learns to ſpeak it; (for I think I may ſay, without wronging any man, I have known many a man go in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them Honeſt, that is, without Ill Deſign, but I never knew one come away ſo again.)—Then comes a Graver Sort among this Black Crew, (for here, as in Hell, are Fiends of Degrees, and different Magnitude),
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0411500300:216"/>
and he falls into Diſcourſe with the New Comer, and gives him more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Advice. <hi>Look you, Sir, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to ſee you melancholly, I am in your Circumſtance too, and if you'll accept of it, I'le give you the beſt Advice I can;</hi> and ſo begins the Grave Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>The man is in too much trouble, not to want Counſel, ſo he thanks him, and he goes on: <hi>Send a Summons to your Creditors, and offer them what you can propoſe in the Pound</hi> (always reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a good Stock to begin the World again), <hi>which if they will take, you are a Freeman, and better than you were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; if they won't take it, you know the worſt of it, you are on the better ſide of the hedge with them: If they will not take it, but will proceed to a Statute, you have nothing to do, but to oppoſe Force with Force; for the Laws of Nature tell you, you muſt not ſtarve; and a Statute is ſo</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0411500300:217"/>
                  <hi>barbarous, ſo unjuſt, ſo malicious a way of proceeding againſt a man, that I do not think any Debtor oblig'd to conſider any thing but his own Preſervation, when once they go on with that.—For why,</hi> ſays the old ſtudi'd Wretch, <hi>ſhould the Creditors ſpend your Eſtate in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and then demand the Debt of you too? Do you owe any thing to the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Statute?</hi> (No, ſays he); <hi>Why then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I warrant their Charges will come to</hi> 200 l. <hi>out of your Eſtate, and they muſt have</hi> 10 s. <hi>a day for ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you and your Family. I cannot ſee why any man ſhould think I am bound in Conſcience to pay the Extravagance of other men. If my Creditors ſpend</hi> 500 l. <hi>in getting in my Eſtate by a Statute, which I offer'd to ſurrender without it, I'le reckon that</hi> 500 l. <hi>paid them, let them take it among them; for Equity is due to a Bankrupt as well as to any man; and if the Laws do not give it us, we muſt take it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0411500300:218"/>
This is too rational Diſcourſe not to pleaſe him, and he proceeds by this Advice; the Creditors cannot agree, but take out a Statute; and the man that offer'd at firſt, it may be, 10 <hi>s.</hi> in the Pound, is kept in that curſed place till he has ſpent it all, and can offer nothing, and then gets away beyond Sea, or after a long Conſumption gets off by an Act of Relief to poor Debtors, and all the Charges of the Statute falls among the Creditors. Thus I knew a Statute taken out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Shopkeeper in the Countrey, and a conſiderable Parcel of Goods too ſeiz'd, and yet the Creditors, what with Charges, and two or three Suits at Law, loſt their whole Debts, and 8 <hi>s. per</hi> Pound Contribution-Money for Charges; and the poor Debtor, like a man under the Surgeon's hand, died in the Operation.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0411500300:219"/>
(2.) Another Evil that Time and Experience has brought to light from this Act, is, when the Debtor himſelf ſhall confederate with ſome particular Creditor to take out a Statute; and this is a Maſter-piece of <hi>Plot</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triegue: For perhaps ſome Creditor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly receiv'd in the way of Trade a large Sum of Money of the Debtor for Goods ſold him when he was <hi>ſui juris;</hi> and he by conſent ſhall own himſelf a Bankrupt before that time, and the Statute ſhall reach back to bring in an Honeſt Man's Eſtate, to help pay a Rogue's Debt. Or a man ſhall go and borrow a Sum of Money upon a Parcel of Goods, and lay them to Pledge; he keeps the Money, and the Statute ſhall fetch away the Goods to help forward the Compoſition. Theſe are Tricks I can give too good an account of, having more than once ſuffer'd by the Experiment. I could
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0411500300:220"/>
give a Scheme of more ways, but I think 'tis needleſs to prove the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of laying aſide that Law, which is pernicious to both Debtor and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, and chiefly hurtful to the Honeſt Man who it was made to preſerve.</p>
               <p>The next Enquiry is, Whether the Extremities of this Law are not often carried on beyond the true Intent and Meaning of the Act it ſelf, for Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Private Ends, to gratify Paſſion and Revenge?</p>
               <p>I remember the Anſwer a Perſon gave me, who had taken out Statutes againſt ſeveral Perſons, and ſome his near Relations, who had fail'd in his Debt; and when I was one time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading him from proſecuting a man who ow'd me Money as well as him, I us'd this Argument with him; <hi>You know the man has nothing left to pay. That's true,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I know that well enough. To what purpoſe then,</hi> ſaid I,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0411500300:221"/>
                  <hi>will you proſecute him? Why, Revenge is ſweet,</hi> ſaid he.—Now a man that will proſecute a Debtor, not as a Debtor, but by way of Revenge, ſuch a man is, I think, not intentionally within the benefit of our Law.</p>
               <p>In order to ſtate the Caſe right, there are four Sorts of People to be conſider'd in this Diſcourſe; and the true Caſe is how to diſtinguiſh them.<list>
                     <item>(1.) There is the Honeſt Debtor, who fails by viſible Neceſſity, Loſſes, Sickneſs, Decay of Trade, or the like.</item>
                     <item>(2.) The Knaviſh, Deſigning, or Idle, Extravagant Debtor, who fails becauſe either he has run out his Eſtate in Exceſſes, or on purpoſe to cheat and abuſe his Creditors.</item>
                     <item>(3.) There is the moderate Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who ſeeks but his own, but will omit no lawful Means to gain
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0411500300:222"/>
it, and yet will hear reaſonable and juſt Arguments and Propoſals.</item>
                     <item>(4.) There is the Rigorous Severe Creditor, that values not whether the Debtor be Honeſt Man or Knave, Able, or Unable; but will have his Debt, <hi>whether it be to be had or no;</hi> without Mercy, without Compaſſion, full of Ill Language, Paſſion, and Revenge.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>How to make a Law to ſuit to all theſe, is the Caſe: <hi>That a neceſſary Favour might be ſhown to the firſt,</hi> in Pity and Compaſſion to the Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, in Commiſeration of Caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Poverty, which no man is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the danger of. <hi>That a due Rigor and Reſtraint be laid upon the ſecond,</hi> that Villany and Knavery might not be encourag'd by a Law. <hi>That a due Care be taken of the third,</hi> that mens Eſtates may, as far as can
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0411500300:223"/>
be, ſecur'd to them. <hi>And due Limits ſet to the laſt,</hi> that no man may have an unlimited Power over his Fellow-Subjects, to the Ruin of both Life and Eſtate.</p>
               <p>All which I humbly conceive might be brought to paſs by the following Method; to which I give the Title of</p>

his Creditors their full and whole Debts, Twenty Shillings in the Pound, without Abatement or Deduction; or ſhall convey away their Books or Goods, in order to bring their Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to any Compoſition; or ſhall not apply to this Office as aforeſaid, ſhall be guilty of Felony, and upon Conviction of the ſame, ſhall ſuffer as a Felon, without Benefit of Clergy.</p>
               <p>And if any ſuch perſon ſhall take Sanctuary either in the <hi>Mint, Friars,</hi> or other pretended Priviledge-Place, or ſhall convey thither any of their Goods as aforeſaid, to ſecure them from their Creditors, upon Complaint there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made to any of His Majeſty's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the Peace, they ſhall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately grant Warrants to the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſearch for the ſaid Perſons and Goods, who ſhall be aided and aſſiſted by the Train'd-Bands, if need be, without any Charge to the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,

               <p>For as the Indigent Debtor is a branch of the Commonwealth, which deſerves its Care, ſo the wilful Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt is one of the <hi>worſt ſort of Thieves.</hi> And it ſeems a little unequal, that a poor Fellow, who for mere Want ſteals from his Neighbour ſome Trifle, ſhall be ſent out of the Kingdom, <hi>and ſometimes out of the World;</hi> while a ſort of people who defye Juſtice, and violently reſiſt the Law, ſhall be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to carry mens Eſtates away before their faces, and no Officers to be found who dare execute the Law upon them.</p>

               <p>I may be a little the warmer on this Head, on account that I have been a larger Sufferer by ſuch means than ordinary: But I appeal to all the world as to the Equity of the Caſe; What the difference is between having my Houſe broken up in the Night to be robb'd, and a man coming in good Credit, and with a Proffer of Ready Money in the middle of the Day, and buying 500 <hi>l.</hi> of Goods, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them directly from my Warehouſe into the <hi>Mint,</hi> and the next day laugh at me, and bid me defiance; yet this I have ſeen done: I think 'tis the juſteſt thing in the world, that the laſt ſhou'd be
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0411500300:241"/>
eſteem'd the greater Thief, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves moſt to be hang'd.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen a Creditor come with his Wiſe and Children, and beg of the Debtor only to let him have part of his own Goods again, which he had bought, knowing and deſigning to break: I have ſeen him with Tears and Intreaties petition for his own, or but ſome of it, and be taunted and ſwore at, and denied by a ſawcy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent Bankrupt: That the poor man has been wholly ruin'd by the Cheat. 'Tis by the Villany of ſuch, many an Honeſt man is undone, Families ſtarv'd and ſent a begging, and yet no Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preſcrib'd by our Laws for it.</p>
               <p>By the aforeſaid <hi>Commiſſion of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,</hi> all this might be moſt effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevented, an Honeſt, Indigent Tradeſman preſerv'd, Knavery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, and puniſh'd; <hi>Mints,</hi>

forbid by Divine Rules; <hi>let the Parſon alone to tell you that,</hi> who has, no queſtion, ſaid as much to as little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in this Caſe as in any other: But I am of the opinion, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo Impertinent, ſo Inſignificant, ſo Senſleſs and Fooliſh, as our vulgar way of Diſcourſe, when mix'd with Oaths and Curſes; and I wou'd only recommend a little Conſideration to our Gentlemen, who have Senſe and Wit enough, and wou'd be aſham'd to ſpeak Nonſenſe in other things, but value themſelves upon their Parts; I wou'd but ask them to put into Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Common-Places of their Diſcourſe, and read them over again, and examine the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Cadence,</hi> the <hi>Grammar</hi> of them; then let them turn them into <hi>Latin,</hi> or tranſlate them into any other Language, and but ſee what a <hi>Jargon</hi> and Confuſion of Speech they make together.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0411500300:255"/>
                  <hi>Swearing,</hi> that Lewdneſs of the Tongue, that Scum and Excrement of the Mouth, is of all Vices the moſt fooliſh and ſenſleſs; it makes a man's Converſation <hi>unpleaſant,</hi> his Diſcourſe <hi>fruitleſs,</hi> and his Language <hi>Nonſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It makes Converſation unpleaſant, at leaſt to thoſe who do not uſe the ſame fooliſh way of Diſcourſe; and indeed, is an Affront to all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany who ſwear not as he does; for if I ſwear and Curſe in Company, I ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſume all the Company likes it, or affront them who do not.</p>
               <p>Then 'tis <hi>fruitleſs;</hi> for no man is believ'd a jot the more for all the Aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verations, <hi>Damnings</hi> and Swearings he makes: Thoſe who are us'd to it themſelves, do not believe a man the more, becauſe they know they are ſo cuſtomary, that they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy little to bind a man's Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0411500300:256"/>
and they who practiſe them not, have ſo mean an opinion of thoſe that do, as makes them think they deſerve no belief.</p>
               <p>Then, they are the Spoilers and Deſtroyers of a man's Diſcourſe, and turn it into perfect <hi>Nonſenſe;</hi> and to make it out, I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend a little to Particulars, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Reader a little to foul his Mouth with the Bruitiſh, Sordid, Senſleſs Expreſſions, which ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen call Polite <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a Grace.</p>
               <p>Some part of them indeed, tho' they are fooliſh enough, as Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a mad, inconſiderate Rage, are yet <hi>Engliſh;</hi> as when a man ſwears he will do this or that, and it may be adds, <hi>God damn him he will;</hi> that is, <hi>God damn him if he don't:</hi> This, tho' it be horrid in another ſenſe, yet may

be read in writing, and is <hi>Engliſh:</hi> But what Language is this?</p>
               <p>Jack, <hi>God damn me</hi> Jack, <hi>How do'ſt do, thou little dear Son of a Whore? How haſt thou done this long time, by God?</hi>—And then they kiſs; and the t'other, as lewd as himſelf, goes on;</p>
               <p>

               <p>This is ſome of our new florid Language, and the Graces and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies of Stile, which if it were put into <hi>Latin,</hi> I wou'd fain know which is the principal Verb.</p>
               <p>But for a little further remembrance of this Impertinence, go among the Gameſters, and there nothing is more frequent than, <hi>God damn the Dice,</hi> or <hi>God damn the Bowls.</hi>

Among the Sportſmen 'tis, <hi>God damn the Hounds,</hi> when they are at a Fault; or <hi>God damn the Horſe,</hi> if he bau'ks a Leap: They call men <hi>Sons of Bitches,</hi> and <hi>Dogs, Sons of Whores:</hi> And innumerable Inſtances may be given of the like Gallantry of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, grown now ſo much a <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, Cuſtom is allow'd to be our beſt Authority for Words, and 'tis fit it ſhould be ſo; but Reaſon muſt be the Judge of Senſe in Language, and Cuſtom can never prevail over it. <hi>Words,</hi> indeed, like Ceremonies in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, may be ſubmitted to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; but <hi>Senſe,</hi> like the Eſſentials, is poſitive, unalterable, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſubmitted to any Juriſdiction; 'tis a Law to it ſelf, 'tis ever the ſame, even an Act of Parliament cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:0411500300:259"/>
                  <hi>Words,</hi> and even Uſages in Stile, may be alter'd by Cuſtom, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties in Speech differ accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſeveral Dialects of the Countrey, and according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner in which ſeveral Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages do ſeverally expreſs themſelves.</p>
               <p>But there is a direct Signification of Words, or a <hi>Cadence in Expreſſion,</hi> which we call ſpeaking <hi>Senſe;</hi> this, like Truth, is ſullen and the ſame, ever was and will be ſo, in what manner, and in what Language ſoever 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd. <hi>Words</hi> without it, are only Noiſe, which any Brute can make as well as we, and Birds much better; for <hi>Words</hi> without <hi>Senſe</hi> make but dull Muſick. Thus a man may ſpeak in <hi>Words,</hi> but perfectly unintelligible as to <hi>Meaning;</hi> he may <hi>talk</hi> a great deal, but <hi>ſay</hi> nothing. But 'tis the proper Poſition of <hi>Words,</hi> adapted to their Significations, which makes them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0411500300:260"/>
and conveys the Meaning of the Speaker to the Underſtanding of the Hearer; the contrary to which we call <hi>Nonſenſe;</hi> and there is a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous crowding in of inſignificant Words, more than are needful to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the thing intended, and this is <hi>Impertinence;</hi> and that again car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd to an extreme, is <hi>ridiculous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus when our Diſcourſe is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin'd with needleſs Oaths, Curſes, and long <hi>Parentheſes</hi> of Imprecations, and with ſome of very indirect ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they become very <hi>Impertinent;</hi> and theſe being run to the extravagant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree inſtanc'd in before, become per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>ridiculous</hi> and <hi>Nonſenſe;</hi> and without forming it into an Argument, it appears to be <hi>Nonſenſe</hi> by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictorineſs; and it appears <hi>Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi> by the Inſignificancy of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0411500300:261"/>
After all, how little it becomes a Gentleman to debauch his Mouth with Foul Language, I refer to themſelves in a few Particulars.</p>
               <p>This Vicious Cuſtom has prevail'd upon Good Manners too far; but yet there are ſome degrees to which it is not yet arriv'd.</p>
               <p>As firſt, The worſt Slaves to this Folly will neither teach it <hi>to,</hi> nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it <hi>in</hi> their Children: Some of the moſt careleſs will indeed nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively teach it, by not reproving them for it; but ſure no man ever order'd his Children to be taught to curſe or ſwear.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Grace of Swearing has not obtain'd to be a Mode yet among the Women; <hi>God damn ye,</hi> does not ſit well upon a Female Tongue; it ſeems to be a Maſculine Vice, which the Women are not arriv'd to yet; and I wou'd only deſire thoſe Gentlemen who pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice it themſelves, to hear a Woman
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0411500300:262"/>
ſwear: It has no Muſick at all there, I am ſure; and juſt as little does it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come any Gentleman, if he wou'd ſuffer himſelf to be judg'd by all the Laws of Senſe or Good Manners in the world.</p>
               <p>'Tis a ſenſleſs, fooliſh, ridiculous Practice; 'tis a Mean to no manner of End; 'tis Words ſpoken which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify nothing; 'tis Folly acted for the ſake of Folly, which is a thing even the Devil himſelf don't practice: The Devil does evil, we ſay, but it is for ſome deſign, either to ſeduce others, or, as ſome Divines ſay, from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Enmity to his Maker: Men Steal for Gain, and Murther to gratify their Avarice or Revenge; Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Raviſhments, Adulteries and Sodomy, are committed to pleaſe a vicious Appetite, and have always alluring Objects; and generally all Vices have ſome previous Cauſe, and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0411500300:263"/>
ſome viſible Tendency; but this, of all Vicious Practices, ſeems the moſt Nonſenſical and Ridiculous; there is neither Pleaſure nor Profit; no Deſign purſued, no Luſt gratified, but is a mere Frenzy of the Tongue, a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the Brain, which works by putting a Contrary upon the Courſe of Nature.</p>
               <p>Again, other Vices men find ſome Reaſon or other to give for, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes to palliate; men plead Want, to extenuate Theft; and ſtrong Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, to excuſe Murthers; <hi>and many a lame Excuſe they will bring for Whoring;</hi> but this ſordid Habit, even thoſe that practiſe it will own to be a Crime, and make no Excuſe for it; and the moſt I cou'd ever hear a man ſay for it, was, That <hi>he cou'd not help it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, as 'tis an inexcuſable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence, ſo 'tis a Breach upon Good Manners and Converſation, for a man
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0411500300:264"/>
to impoſe the Clamour of his Oaths upon the Company he converſes with; if there be any one perſon in the Company that does not approve the way, 'tis an impoſing upon him with a freedom beyond Civility; as if a man ſhou'd <hi>Fart</hi> before a Juſtice, or <hi>talk Bawdy</hi> before the Queen, or the like.</p>
               <p>To ſuppreſs this, Laws, Acts of Parliaments, and Proclamations, are Bawbles and Banters, the Laughter of the Lewd Party, and never had, as I cou'd perceive, any Influence upon the Practice; nor are any of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates fond or forward of putting them in execution.</p>
               <p>It muſt be Example, not Penalties, muſt ſink this Crime; and if the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of <hi>England</hi> wou'd once drop it as a Mode, the Vice is ſo fooliſh and ridiculous in it ſelf, 'twou'd ſoon grow odious and out of faſhion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:0411500300:265"/>
This Work ſuch an Academy might begin; and I believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wou'd ſo ſoon explode the Practice, as the Publick Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of it by ſuch a Society. Where all our Cuſtoms and Habits both in Speech and Behaviour, ſhou'd receive an Authority. All the Diſputes about Precedency of Wit, with the Manners, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and Uſages of the Theatre wou'd be decided here; Plays ſhou'd paſs here before they were Acted, and the Criticks might give their Cenſures, and damn at their pleaſure; nothing wou'd ever dye which once receiv'd Life at this Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal: The Two Theatres might end their Jangle, and diſpute for Priority no more; Wit and Real Worth ſhou'd decide the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, and here ſhou'd be the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Judge.</hi>

                  <l>They hate <hi>Conformity,</hi> tho' 'tis in Vice.</l>
                  <l>Some are for <hi>Patent-Hierarchy;</hi> and ſome,</l>

Next to this, which I eſteem as the moſt Noble and moſt Uſeful Propoſal in this Book, I proceed to Academies for Military Studies; and becauſe I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign rather to expreſs my meaning, than make a large Book, I bring them all into one Chapter.</p>
               <p>I allow the War is the beſt Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the World, where men ſtudy by Neceſſity, and practiſe by Force, and both to ſome purpoſe, with Duty in the Action, and a Reward in the End; and 'tis evident to any man who knows the World, or has made any Obſervations on things, what an Improvement the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation has made, during this Seven Years War.</p>
               <p>But ſhould you ask how dear it firſt coſt, and what a condition <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was in for a War at firſt on this account; how almoſt all our Engineers and Great Officers were Foreigners, it
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0411500300:268"/>
may put us in mind how neceſſary it is to have our people ſo practis'd in the Arts of War, that they may not be Novices when they come to the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment.</p>
               <p>I have heard ſome, who were no great Friends to the Government, take advantage to reflect upon the King in the beginning of his Wars in <hi>Ireland,</hi> That he did not care to truſt the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> but all his Great Officers, his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, and Engineers were Foreigners. And tho' the Caſe was ſo plain as to need no Anſwer, and the Perſons ſuch as deſerv'd none, yet this muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, tho' twas very ſtrange, That when the preſent King took Poſſeſſion of this Kingdom, and ſeeing himſelf entring upon the bloodieſt War this Age has known, began to regulate his Army, he found but very few among the whole Martial Part of the Nation fit to make uſe of for General Officers; and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0411500300:269"/>
was forced to employ Strangers, and make them <hi>Engliſhmen;</hi> as the Counts <hi>Schomberg, Ginkel, Solms, Ruvigny,</hi> and others: And yet it is to be obſerv'd alſo, that all the Encouragement imaginable was given to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen, to qualify themſelves, by giving no leſs than Sixteen Regiments to Gentlemen of Good Families, who had never been in any Service, and knew but very little how to command them: Of theſe ſeveral are now in the Army, and have the Rewards ſuitable to their Merit, being Major-Generals, Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deers, and the like.</p>
               <p>If then a long Peace had ſo reduc'd us to a degree of Ignorance that might have been dangerous to us, had we not a King, who is always follow'd by the greateſt Maſters in the World, Who knows what Peace and different Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors may bring us to again?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0411500300:270"/>
The manner of making War dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers perhaps as much as any thing in the world; and if we look no further back than our Civil Wars; 'tis plain a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>then</hi> wou'd hardly be fit to be a Collonel now, ſaving his Capacity of Improvement. The Defenſive Art al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways follows the Offenſive; and tho' the latter has extremely got the ſtart of the former in this Age, yet the other is mightily improving alſo.</p>
               <p>We ſaw in <hi>England</hi> a bloody Civil War, where, according to the old Temper of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> fighting was the Buſineſs. To have an Army ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch a Poſt, as not to be able to come at them, was a thing never heard of in that War; even the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Party would always come out and fight; <hi>Dunbar</hi> Fight, for inſtance; and they that were beaten to day, would fight again to morrow, and ſeek one another out with ſuch Eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0411500300:271"/>
as if they had been in haſte to have their Brains knock'd out. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campments, Intrenchments, Batteries, Counter-marchings, fortifying of Camps, and Cannonadings, were ſtrange, and almoſt unknown things, and whole Campaigns were paſt over, and hardly any Tents made uſe of. Battels, Surprizes, Storming of Towns, Skirmiſhes, Sieges, Ambuſcades, and Beating up Quarters, was the News of every day. Now 'tis frequent to have Armies of Fifty thouſand men of a ſide ſtand at Bay within view of one another, and ſpend a whole Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign in Dodging, or as 'tis genteely call'd, <hi>Obſerving one another,</hi> and then march off into Winter-Quarters. The difference is in the Maxims of War, which now differ as much from what they were formerly, as Long Perukes do from Piqued Beards; or as the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of the People do now, from what
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0411500300:272"/>
they then wore. The preſent Maxims of the War are;<q>Never Fight without a manifeſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</q>
                  <q>And always Encamp ſo as not to be forc'd to it.</q> And if two oppoſite Generals nicely obſerve both theſe Rules, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they ſhou'd ever come to fight.</p>
               <p>I grant that this way of making War ſpends generally more Money and leſs Blood than former Wars did; but then it ſpins Wars out to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Length; and I almoſt queſtion whether if this had been the way of Fighting of old, our Civil War had not laſted till this day. Their Maxim was,
<q>Whereever you meet your Enemy, fight him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0411500300:273"/>
But the Caſe is quite different now; and I think 'tis plain in the preſent War, that 'tis not he who has the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Sword, ſo much as he who has the <hi>longeſt Purſe,</hi> will hold the War out beſt. <hi>Europe</hi> is all engag'd in the War, and the Men will never be exhauſted while either Party can find Money; but he who finds himſelf pooreſt, muſt give out firſt; and this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the <hi>French</hi> King, who now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to Peace, and owns it, while at the ſame time his Armies are nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and whole; but the Sinews fail, he finds his Exchequer fail, his Kingdom drain'd, and Money hard to come at: Not that I believe half the Reports we have had of the Miſery and Poverty of the <hi>French</hi> are true; but 'tis manifeſt the King of <hi>France</hi> finds, whatever his Armies may do, his Money won't hold out ſo long as the <hi>Confederates;</hi> and therefore he uſes
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0411500300:274"/>
all the means poſſible to procure a Peace, while he may do it with the moſt advantage.</p>
               <p>There is no queſtion but the <hi>French</hi> may hold the War out ſeveral Years longer; but their King is too wiſe to let things run to extremity; he will rather condeſcend to Peace upon hard terms now, than ſtay longer, if he finds himſelf in danger to be forc'd to worſe.</p>
               <p>This being the only Digreſſion I deſign to be guilty of, I hope I ſhall be excus'd it.</p>
               <p>The Sum of all is this, That ſince 'tis ſo neceſſary to be in a condition for War in a time of Peace, our People ſhou'd be inur'd to it. 'Tis ſtrange that every thing ſhou'd be ready but the Soldier: Ships are ready, and our Trade keeps the Seamen always
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0411500300:275"/>
taught, and breeds up more; but Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, Horſemen, Engineers, Gunners, and the like, muſt be bred and taught; men are not born with Muskets on their Shoulders, nor Fortifications in their Heads; 'tis not natural to ſhoot Bombs, and undermine Towns: For which purpoſe I propoſe,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Royal Academy for Military Exerciſes.</hi>

I remember the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0411500300:291"/>
Story of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, an Officer at the Siege of <hi>Limerick</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who tho' he was Brave enough upon Action, yet for the only matter of being ignorant in the Terms of Art, and knowing not how to talk <hi>Camp-Language,</hi> was expos'd to be laugh'd at by the whole Army, for miſtaking the opening of the Trenches, which he thought had been a Mine againſt the Town.</p>
               <p>The Experiments of theſe Colleges wou'd be as well worth publiſhing, as the Acts of the <hi>Royal Society.</hi> To which purpoſe the Houſe muſt be built where they may have Ground to caſt Bombs, to raiſe Regular Works, as Batteries, Baſtions, Half-Moons, Redoubts, Horn-works, Forts, and the like; with the convenience of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to draw round ſuch Works, to exerciſe the Engineers in all the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Experiments of Dreining, and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0411500300:292"/>
Mining under Ditches. There muſt be room to fire Great Shot at a diſtance, to Canonade a Camp, to throw all ſorts of Fire-works and Machines, that are or ſhall be invented; to open Trenches, form Camps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Publick Exerciſes will be alſo very diverting, and more worth while for any Gentlemen to ſee, than the Sights or Shews which our people in <hi>England</hi> are ſo fond of.</p>
               <p>I believe, as a Conſtitution might be form'd from theſe Generals, this wou'd be the Greateſt, the Gallanteſt, and the moſt Uſeful Foundation in the World. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentry wou'd be the beſt qualifi'd, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, beſt accepted abroad, and moſt uſeful at home of any people in the world; and His Majeſty ſhou'd never more be expos'd to the neceſſity of employing Foreigners in the Poſts of Truſt and Service in His Armies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0411500300:293"/>
And that the whole Kingdom might in ſome degree be better qualifi'd for Service, I think the following Project wou'd be very uſeful.</p>
               <p>When our Military Weapon was the <hi>Long-Bow,</hi> at which our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation in ſome meaſure excell'd the whole World, the meaneſt Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was a good Archer; and that which qualifi'd them ſo much for Service in the War, was their Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Times of Peace; which alſo had this good Effect, That when an Army was to be rais'd, they needed no diſciplining: And for the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the People to an Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſo publickly Profitable, an Act of Parliament was made, to oblige every Pariſh to maintain Buts for the Youth in the Countrey to ſhoot at.</p>
               <p>Since our way of fighting is now alter'd; and this deſtructive Engine, the <hi>Muſquet,</hi> is the proper Arms for the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0411500300:294"/>
Soldier, I could wiſh the Diverſion alſo of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would change too, that our Pleaſures and Profit might correſpond. 'Tis a great Hindrance to this Nation, eſpecially where Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Armies are a Grievance, that if ever a War commence, men muſt have at leaſt a Year before they are thought fit to face an Enemy, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them how to handle their Arms; and new-rais'd men are call'd <hi>Raw Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</hi> To help this, at leaſt in ſome meaſure, I wou'd propoſe, That the Publick Exerciſes of our Youth ſhou'd by ſome Publick Encouragement, (<hi>for Penalties won't do it</hi>) be drawn off from the fooliſh Boyiſh Sports of Cocking, and Cricketing, and from Tipling, to ſhooting with a Firelock; an Exerciſe as Pleaſant, as 'tis Manly and Generous; and <hi>Swimming,</hi> which is a thing ſo many ways profitable, beſides its being a great Preſervative
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0411500300:295"/>
of Health, that methinks no Man ought to be without it.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) For <hi>Shooting;</hi> the Colleges I have mention'd above, having provided for the inſtructing the Gentry at the King's Charge; the Gentry in return of that Favour ſhou'd introduce it among the Countrey-people; which might eaſily be done thus:</p>
               <p>If every Countrey-Gentleman, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his degree, wou'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to ſet up a Prize, to be ſhot for by the Town he lives in, or the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, about once a year, or twice a year, or oftner, as they think fit; which Prize not ſingle only to him who ſhoots neareſt, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Cuſtom of Shooting:</p>
               <p>This wou'd certainly ſet all the Young Men in <hi>England</hi> a ſhooting, and make them Marks-men; for they wou'd be always practiſing and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0411500300:296"/>
Matches among themſelves too, and the advantage wou'd be found in a War; for no doubt if all the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in a Battalion took a true Level at their Enemy, there wou'd be much more Execution done at a diſtance than there is; whereas it has been known now, that a Battalion of men has receiv'd the Fire of another Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and not loſt above 30 or 40 men; and I ſuppoſe it will not eaſily be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got how at the Battel of <hi>Agrim,</hi> a Battalion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army receiv'd the whole Fire of an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Regiment of Dragoons, but never knew to this day whether they had any Bullets or no; and I need appeal no further than to any Officer that ſerv'd in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> War, what advantages the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies made of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> being ſuch wonderful Marks-men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0411500300:297"/>
Under this Head of <hi>Academies,</hi> I might bring in a Project for</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Academy for Women.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Have often thought of it as one of the moſt barbarous Cuſtoms in the world, conſidering us as a Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd and a Chriſtian Countrey, that we deny the advantages of Learning to Women. We reproach the Sex every day with Folly and Impertinence, while I am confident, had they the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Education equal to us, they wou'd be guilty of leſs than our ſelves.</p>
               <p>One wou'd wonder indeed how it ſhou'd happen that Women are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible at all, ſince they are only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to Natural Parts for all their Knowledge. Their Youth is ſpent to teach them to Stitch and Sow, or make Bawbles: They are taught to Read indeed, and perhaps to Write their Names, or ſo; and that is the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0411500300:298"/>
heighth of a Woman's Education. And I wou'd but ask any who ſlight the Sex for their Underſtanding, What is a Man (a Gentleman, I mean) good for, that is taught no more?</p>
               <p>I need not give Inſtances, or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Character of a Gentleman with a good Eſtate, and of a good Family, and with tolerable Parts, and examine what Figure he makes for want of Education.</p>
               <p>The Soul is plac'd in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy like a rough Diamond, and muſt be poliſh'd, or the Luſtre of it will never appear: And 'tis manifeſt, that as the Rational Soul diſtinguiſhes us from Brutes, ſo Education carries on the diſtinction, and makes ſome leſs brutiſh than others: This is too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to need any demonſtration. But why then ſhou'd Women be deni'd the benefit of Inſtruction? If Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Underſtanding had been
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0411500300:299"/>
uſeleſs additions to the Sex, God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty wou'd never have given them Capacities; for he made nothing needleſs: Beſides, I wou'd ask ſuch, What they can ſee in Ignorance, that they ſhou'd think it a neceſſary Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a Woman? Or how much worſe is a Wiſe Woman than a Fool? Or what has the Woman done to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the Privilege of being taught? Does ſhe plague us with her Pride and Impertinence? Why did we not let her learn, that ſhe might have had more Wit? Shall we upbraid Women with Folly, when 'tis only the Error of this inhuman Cuſtom, that hindred them being made wiſer?</p>
               <p>The Capacities of Women are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be greater, and their Senſes quicker than thoſe of the Men; and what they might be capable of being bred to, is plain from ſome Inſtances of Female-Wit, which this Age is not
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0411500300:300"/>
without; which upbraids us with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and looks as if we deni'd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the advantages of Education, for fear they ſhou'd <hi>vye</hi> with the Men in their Improvements.</p>
               <p>To remove this Objection, and that Women might have at leaſt a needful Opportunity of Education in all ſorts of Uſeful Learning, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Draught of an Academy for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I know 'tis dangerous to make Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Appearances of the Sex; they are not either to be <hi>confin'd</hi> or <hi>expos'd;</hi> the firſt will diſagree with their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the laſt with their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; and therefore it is ſomewhat difficult; and I doubt a Method pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by an Ingenious Lady, in a little Book, call'd, <hi>Advice to the Ladies,</hi> would be found impracticable. For, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my Reſpect to the Sex, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, which perhaps is a little peculiar
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0411500300:301"/>
to them, at leaſt in their Youth, will not bear the Reſtraint; and I am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd, nothing but the heighth of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry can keep up a Nunnery: Women are extravagantly deſirous of going to Heaven, and will puniſh their <hi>Pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Bodies</hi> to get thither; but nothing elſe will do it; and even in that caſe ſometimes it falls out that <hi>Nature will prevail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I talk therefore of an Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy for Women, I mean both the Model, the Teaching, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, different from what is propos'd by that Ingenious Lady, for whoſe Propoſal I have a very great Eſteem, and alſo a great Opinion of her Wit; different too from all ſorts of Religious Confinement, and above all, from <hi>Vows of Celibacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore the Academy I propoſe ſhould differ but little from Publick Schools, wherein ſuch Ladies as were
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0411500300:302"/>
willing to ſtudy, ſhou'd have all the advantages of Learning ſuitable to their Genius.</p>
               <p>But ſince ſome Severities of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline more than ordinary wou'd be abſolutely neceſſary to preſerve the Reputation of the Houſe, that Perſons of Quality and Fortune might not be a fraid to venture their Children thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I ſhall venture to make a ſmall Scheme by way of Eſſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Houſe I wou'd have built in a Form by it ſelf, as well as in a Place by it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Building ſhou'd be of Three plain Fronts, without any Jettings, or Bearing-Work, that the Eye might at a Glance ſee from one Coin to the other; the Gardens wall'd in the ſame Triangular Figure, with a large Moat, and but one Entrance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0411500300:303"/>
When thus every part of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation was contriv'd as well as might be for diſcovery, and to render <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieguing</hi> dangerous, I wou'd have no Guards, no Eyes, no Spies ſet over the Ladies, but ſhall expect them to be try'd by the Principles of Honour and ſtrict Virtue.</p>
               <p>And if I am ask'd, <hi>Why?</hi> I muſt ask Pardon of my own Sex for giving this reaſon for it:</p>
               <p>I am ſo much in Charity with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſo well acquainted with Men, that 'tis my opinion, There needs no other Care to prevent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieguing, than to keep the men ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually away: For tho' <hi>Inclination,</hi> which we prettily call <hi>Love,</hi> does ſometimes move a little too viſibly in the Sex, and Frailty often follows; yet I think verily, <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> which we miſcall <hi>Modeſty,</hi> has ſo far the Aſcendant over the Sex, that <hi>Solicitation</hi> always goes before it.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:0411500300:304"/>
                  <l>Cuſtom with Women 'ſtead of Virtue rules;</l>
                  <l>It leads the Wiſeſt, and commands the Fools:</l>
                  <l>For this alone, when Inclinations reign,</l>
                  <l>Tho' Virtue's fled, will Acts of Vice reſtrain.</l>
                  <l>Only by Cuſtom 'tis that Virtue lives,</l>
                  <l>And Love requires to be ask'd, before it gives.</l>
                  <l>For that which we call <hi>Modeſty,</hi> is <hi>Pride:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>They ſcorn to ask, and hate to be deni'd.</l>
                  <l>'Tis Cuſtom thus prevails upon their Want;</l>
                  <l>They'll never beg, what askt they eas'ly grant.</l>
                  <l>And when the needleſs Ceremony's over,</l>

Upon this ground I am perſuaded ſuch Meaſures might be taken, that the Ladies might have all the Freedom in the world within their own Walls, and yet no Intrieguing, no Indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, nor Scandalous Affairs happen; and in order to this, the following Cuſtoms and Laws ſhou'd be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the Colleges; of which I wou'd propoſe One at leaſt in every County in <hi>England,</hi> and about Ten for the City of <hi>London.</hi>

And this Law wou'd by no means be ſevere; becauſe any Woman who was willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Addreſſes of a Man, might diſcharge her ſelf of the Houſe when ſhe pleas'd; and on the contrary, any Woman who had occaſion, might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge her ſelf of the Impertinent Addreſſes of any Perſon ſhe had an Averſion to, by entring into the Houſe.</item>

               </p>
               <p>The Perſons who Enter, ſhou'd be taught all ſorts of Breeding ſuitable to both their Genius and their Quality; and in particular, <hi>Muſick</hi> and <hi>Dancing,</hi> which it wou'd be cruelty to bar the Sex of, becauſe they are their Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: But beſides this, they ſhou'd be taught Languages, as particularly <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian;</hi> and I wou'd ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Injury of giving a Woman more Tongues than one.</p>
               <p>They ſhou'd, as a particular Study, be taught all the Graces of Speech, and all the neceſſary Air of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; which our common Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is ſo defective in, that I need not expoſe it: They ſhou'd be brought to read Books, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Hiſtory, and ſo to read as to make them underſtand the World,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0411500300:308"/>
and be able to know and judge of things when they hear of them.</p>
               <p>To ſuch whoſe Genius wou'd lead them to it, I wou'd deny no ſort of Learning; but the chief thing in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is to cultivate the Underſtandings of the Sex, that they may be capable of all ſorts of Converſation; that their Parts and Judgments being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, they may be as Profitable in their Converſation as they are Pleaſant.</p>
               <p>Women, in my obſervation, have little or no difference in them, but as they are, or are not diſtinguiſh'd by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation. Tempers indeed may in ſome degree influence them, but the main diſtinguiſhing part is their Breeding.</p>
               <p>The whole Sex are generally Quick and Sharp: I believe I may be allow'd to ſay generally ſo; for you rarely ſee them lumpiſh and heavy when they are Children, as Boys will often be. If a Woman be well-bred, and taught
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0411500300:309"/>
the proper Management of her Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Wit, ſhe proves generally very ſenſible and retentive: And without partiality, a Woman of Senſe and Manners is the Fineſt and moſt Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Part of God's Creation; the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of her Maker, and the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his ſingular regard to Man, his Darling Creature, to whom he gave the beſt Gift either God could beſtow, or man receive: And 'tis the ſordid'ſt Piece of Folly and Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the world, to withhold from the Sex the due Luſtre which the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Education gives to the Natural Beauty of their Minds.</p>
               <p>A Woman well Bred and well Taught, furniſh'd with the additional Accompliſhments of Knowledge and Behaviour, <hi>is a Creature without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon;</hi> her Society is the Emblem of ſublimer Enjoyments; her Perſon is Angelick, and her Converſation heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0411500300:310"/>
ſhe is all Softneſs and Sweetneſs, Peace, Love, Wit, and Delight: She is every way ſuitable to the ſublimeſt Wiſh; and the man that has ſuch a one to his Portion, has nothing to do but to rejoice in her, and be thankful.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, Suppoſe her to be the <hi>very ſame</hi> Woman, and rob her of the Benefit of Education, and it follows thus;</p>
               <p>If her Temper be Good, want of Education makes her Soft and Eaſy.</p>
               <p>Her Wit, for want of Teaching, makes her Impertinent and Talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>Her Knowledge, for want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Experience, makes her Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and Whimſical.</p>
               <p>If her Temper be Bad, want of Breeding makes her worſe, and ſhe grows Haughty, Inſolent, and Loud.</p>
               <p>If ſhe be Paſſionate, want of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners makes her Termagant, and a
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0411500300:311"/>
Scold, <hi>which is much at one with Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If ſhe be Proud, want of Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which ſtill is Breeding) makes her Conceited, Fantaſtick, and Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
               <p>And from theſe ſhe degenerates to be Turbulent, Clamorous, Noiſy, Naſty, <hi>and the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Methinks Mankind for their own ſakes, ſince ſay what we will of the Women, we all think fit one time or other to be concern'd with 'em, ſhou'd take ſome care to breed them up to be <hi>ſuitable</hi> and <hi>ſerviceable,</hi> if they expected no ſuch thing as <hi>Delight</hi> from 'em. Bleſs us! What Care do we take to Breed up a good Horſe, and to Break him well! and what a Value do we put upon him when it is done, and all becauſe he ſhou'd be fit for our uſe! and why not a Woman? Since all her Ornaments and Beauty, without
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0411500300:312"/>
ſuitable Behaviour, is a Cheat in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, like the falſe Tradeſman, who puts the beſt of his Goods uppermoſt, that the Buyer may think the reſt are of the ſame Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>Beauty of the Body, which is the Womens Glory, ſeems to be now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally beſtow'd, and Nature, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Providence, to lye under ſome Scandal about it, as if 'twas given a Woman for a Snare to Men, and ſo make a kind of a <hi>She-Devil</hi> of her: Becauſe they ſay Exquiſite Beauty is <hi>rarely</hi> given with Wit; <hi>more rarely</hi> with Goodneſs of Temper, and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at all</hi> with Modeſty. And ſome, pretending to juſtify the Equity of ſuch a Diſtribution, will tell us 'tis the Effect of the Juſtice of Providence in dividing particular Excellencies among all his Creatures, <hi>ſhare and ſhare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, as it were,</hi> that all might for ſomething or other be acceptable to

one another, elſe ſome wou'd be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd.</p>
               <p>I think both theſe Notions falſe; and yet the laſt, which has the ſhew of Reſpect to Providence, is the worſt; for it ſuppoſes Providence to be Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and Empty; as if it had not wherewith to furniſh all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures it had made, but was fain to be parcimonious in its Gifts, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute them by <hi>piece-meal,</hi> for fear of being exhauſted.</p>
               <p>If I might venture my Opinion againſt an almoſt univerſal Notion, I wou'd ſay, Moſt men miſtake the Proceedings of Providence in this caſe, and all the world at this day are miſtaken in their Practice about it. And becauſe the Aſſertion is very bold, I deſire to explain my ſelf.</p>
               <p>That Almighty Firſt Cauſe which made us all, is certainly the Fountain of Excellence, as it is of Being, and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0411500300:316"/>
by an Inviſible Influence could have diffuſed Equal Qualities and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to all the Creatures it has made, as the Sun does its Light, without the leaſt Ebb or Diminution to himſelf; and has given indeed to every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual ſufficient to the Figure his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence had deſign'd him in the world.</p>
               <p>I believe it might be defended, if I ſhould ſay, That I do ſuppoſe God has given to all Mankind equal Gifts and Capacities, in that he has given them all <hi>Souls</hi> equally capable; and that the whole difference in Mankind proceeds either from Accidental Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the Make of their Bodies, or from the <hi>fooliſh Difference</hi> of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>From Accidental Difference in Bodies.</hi> I wou'd avoid diſcourſing here of the Philoſophical Poſition of the Soul in the Body: But if it be true
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0411500300:317"/>
as Philoſophers do affirm, That the Underſtanding and Memory is dilated or contracted according to the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Dimenſions of the Organ through which 'tis convey'd; then tho' God has given a Soul as capable to me as another, yet if I have any Natural Defect in thoſe Parts of the Body by which the Soul ſhou'd act, I may have the ſame Soul infus'd as another man, and yet he be a Wiſe Man, and I a very Fool. <hi>For example,</hi> If a Child naturally have a Defect in the Organ of Hearing, ſo that he cou'd never diſtinguiſh any Sound, that Child ſhall never be able to ſpeak or read, tho' it have a Soul capable of all the Accompliſhments in the world. The Brain is the Centre of the Souls actings, where all the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Faculties of it reſide; and 'tis obſervable, A man who has a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row contracted Head, in which there
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0411500300:318"/>
is not room for the due and neceſſary Operations of Nature by the Brain, is never a man of very great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that Proverb, <hi>A Great Head and Little Wit,</hi> is not meant by Nature, but is a Reproof upon Sloth; as if one ſhou'd, by way of wonder, ſay, <hi>Fye, fye, you that have a Great Head, have but Little Wit, that's ſtrange! that muſt certainly be your own fault.</hi> From this Notion I do believe there is a great matter in the Breed of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; not that Wiſe Men ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways get Wiſe Children; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Strong and Healthy Bodies have the Wiſeſt Children; and Sickly Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bodies affect the Wits as well as the Bodies of their Children. We are eaſily perſuaded to believe this in the Breeds of Horſes, Cocks, Dogs, and other Creatures; and I believe 'tis as viſible in Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:0411500300:319"/>
But to come cloſer to the buſineſs; the great diſtinguiſhing difference which is ſeen in the world between Men and Women, is in their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this is manifeſted by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with the difference between one Man or Woman, and another.</p>
               <p>And herein it is that I take upon me to make ſuch a bold Aſſertion, That all the World are miſtaken in their Practice about Women: For I cannot think that God Almighty ever made them ſo delicate, ſo glorious Creatures, and furniſh'd them with ſuch Charms, ſo Agreeable and ſo Delightful to Mankind, with Souls capable of the ſame Accompliſhments with Men, and all to be only Stewards of our Houſes, <hi>Cooks and Slaves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not that I am for exalting the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Government in the leaſt: But, in ſhort, <hi>I would have Men take Women for Companions, and Educate them to be</hi>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0411500300:320"/>
                  <hi>fit for it.</hi> A Woman of Senſe and Breeding will ſcorn as much to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon the Prerogative of the Man, as a Man of Senſe will ſcorn to oppreſs the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> of the Woman. But if the Womens Souls were refin'd and improv'd by Teaching, that word wou'd be loſt; to ſay, <hi>The Weakneſs of the Sex,</hi> as to Judgment, wou'd be Nonſenſe; for Ignorance and Folly wou'd be no more to be found among Women than Men. I remember a Paſſage which I heard from a very Fine Woman, ſhe had Wit and Capacity enough, an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Shape and Face, and a Great Fortune, but had been cloyſter'd up all her time, and for fear of being ſtoll'n had not had the liberty of being taught the common neceſſary know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Womens Affairs; and when ſhe came to converſe in the world, her Natural Wit made her ſo ſenſible
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0411500300:321"/>
of the want of Education, that ſhe gave this ſhort Reflection on her ſelf:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am aſham'd to talk with my very Maids,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>for I don't know when they do right or wrong: I had more need go to School, than be Married.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I need not enlarge on the Loſs the Defect of Education is to the Sex, nor argue the Benefit of the contrary Practice; 'tis a thing will be more eaſily granted than remedied: This Chapter is but an Eſſay at the thing, and I refer the Practice to thoſe Happy Days, if ever they ſhall be, when men ſhall be wiſe enough to mend it.</p>

Nay, the very Judges themſelves (no Reflection upon their Learning) have been very much at a loſs in giving Inſtructions to a Jury, and Juries much more to underſtand them; for when all is done, Juries, which are not always, nor often indeed of the Wiſeſt Men, are to be ſure ill Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires in Cauſes ſo nice, that the very Lawyer and Judge can hardly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them.</p>
               <p>The Affairs of Merchants are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſuch variety of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſuch new and unuſual Contingences, which change and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in every Age, with a multitude of Niceties and Punctilio's; and thoſe again altering as the Cuſtoms and Uſages of Countries and States do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that it has been found impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to make any Laws that could extend to all Caſes: And our Law it ſelf does tacitly acknowledge its own
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0411500300:325"/>
Imperfection in this Caſe, by allowing the <hi>Cuſtom of Merchants</hi> to paſs as a kind of Law, in caſes of Difficulty.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it ſeems to me a moſt Natural Proceeding, That ſuch Affairs ſhou'd be heard before, and judg'd by ſuch as by known Experience and long Practice in the Cuſtoms and Uſages of Foreign Negoce, are of courſe the moſt capable to determine the ſame.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Reaſonableneſs of the Argument, there are ſome Caſes in our Laws in which it is impoſſible for a Plaintiff to make out his Caſe, or a Defendant to make out his Plea; as in particular, when his Proofs are beyond Seas, for no Proteſts, Certifications, or Procurations are allow'd in our Courts as Evidence; and the Damages are Infinite and Irretrievable by any of the Proceedings of our Laws.</p>

For the anſwering all theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, a Court might be erected by Authority of Parliament, to be compos'd of Six Judges Commiſſioners, who ſhou'd have Power to Hear and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide as a Court of Equity, under the Title of, <hi>A Court-Merchant.</hi>

(1.)

                     <item>1. Our Naval Preparations are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded, and our Fleets always late, for want of Men; which has expos'd them not a little, and been the ruin of many a good and well-laid Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</item>
                     <item>2. Several Irregularities follow, as the Officers taking Money to diſmiſs Able Seamen, and filling up their Complement with raw and improper Perſons.</item>
                     <item>3. Oppreſſions, Quarrelings, and oftentimes Murthers, by the raſhneſs of Preſs-maſters, and the obſtinacy of ſome unwilling to go.</item>

For Cure of theſe Inconveniences it is, the following Project is propos'd; with which the Seamen can have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be diſſatisfied, nor are not at all injur'd; and yet the Damage ſuſtain'd will be prevented, and an immenſe Sum of Money ſpar'd, which is now ſquander'd away by the Profuſeneſs and Luxury of the Seamen: For if Prodigality weakens the Publick Wealth of the Kingdom in general, then are the Seamen but ill Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-men, who are not viſibly the Richer for the prodigious Sums of Money paid them either by the King or the Merchant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Project is this;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That by an Act of Parliament an Office or Court be erected, within the Juriſdiction of the Court of Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſubject to the Lord High Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral;

               <p>The Circumſtantials of this Office;<list>
                     <item>1. No Captain or Maſter of any Ship or Veſſel ſhou'd dare to hire or carry to Sea with him any Seaman, but ſuch as he ſhall receive from the Office aforeſaid.</item>

2.

                     <item>3. No Sailor cou'd deſert, becauſe no Employment wou'd be to be had elſewhere.</item>
                     <item>4. All Ships at their clearing at the Cuſtom-houſe, ſhou'd receive a Ticket to the Office for Men, where wou'd be always Choice rather than Scarcity; who ſhou'd be deliver'd over by the Office to the Captain or Maſter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Trouble or Delay; all liberty of Choice to be allow'd both to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Men, only ſo as to give up all Diſputes to the Officers appointed to decide.<p>

Note, <hi>By this wou'd be avoided the great Charge Captains and Owners are at to keep Men on Board before they are ready to go; whereas now the care of getting Men will be over, and all come on board in one day; for the Captain carrying the Ticket to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he may go and chuſe his Men, if he will; otherwiſe they will be ſent on board him, by Tickets ſent to their Dwellings, to repair on board ſuch a Ship.</hi>

For all theſe Men that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or Maſter of the Ship takes, he ſhall pay the Office, not the Seamen, 28 <hi>s. per</hi> Month, (which 4 <hi>s. per</hi> Month Overplus of Wages, will be employ'd to pay the Half-Pay to the men out of Employ), and ſo in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Wages for Juniors.</item>

               <p>For by this Method all the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Kingdom ſhou'd be the King's hired Servants, and receive their Wages from him, <hi>whoever em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd them;</hi> and no man cou'd hire or employ them, but from him: The Merchant ſhou'd hire them of the King, and pay the King for them; nor wou'd there be a Seaman in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> out of Employ, <hi>which, by the way, wou'd prevent their ſeeking Service abroad.</hi> If they were not actually at Sea, they wou'd receive Half-Pay, and might be employ'd in Works about the Yards, Stores, and Navy, to keep all things in Repair.</p>

                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:0411500300:346"/>
If a Fleet or Squadron was to be fitted out, they wou'd be mann'd in a Week's time, for all the Seamen in <hi>England</hi> wou'd be ready: Nor wou'd they be ſhye of the Service; for <hi>it is not</hi> an Averſion to the King's Service; nor <hi>'tis not</hi> that the Duty is harder in the Men of War than the Merchant-men; nor <hi>'tis not</hi> fear of Danger which makes our Seamen lurk, and hide, and hang back in a time of War; but 'tis <hi>Wages</hi> is the matter: 24 <hi>s. per</hi> Month in the King's Service, and 40 to 50 <hi>s. per</hi> Month from the Merchant, is the true cauſe; and the Seaman is in the right of it too; for who wou'd ſerve his King and Countrey, and fight, and be knock'd o' the head at 24 <hi>s. per</hi> Month that can have 50 <hi>s.</hi> without that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard: And till this be remedied, in vain are all the Encouragements which can be given to Seamen; for
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0411500300:347"/>
they tend but to make them Inſolent, and encourage their Extravagance.</p>
               <p>Nor wou'd this Proceeding be any damage to the Seamen in general; for 24 <hi>s. per</hi> Month Wages, and to be kept in conſtant Service, or Half-Pay when idle, is really better to the Seamen than 45 <hi>s. per</hi> Month, as they now take it, conſidering how long they often lye idle on ſhore, out of Pay: For the extravagant Price of Seamens Wages, tho' it has been an Intolerable Burthen to Trade, has not viſibly enrich'd the Sailors; and they may as well be content with 24 <hi>s. per</hi> Month now as formerly.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, Trade wou'd be ſenſibly reviv'd by it, the intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Price of Freights wou'd be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the Publick wou'd reap an immenſe Benefit by the Payments men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the Propoſal; as,<list>
                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:0411500300:348"/>
                     <item>(1.) 4 <hi>s. per</hi> Month upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of all the Seamen employ'd by the Merchant; which if we allow 200000 Seamen always in Employ, as there cannot be leſs in all the Ships be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>England,</hi> is 40000 <hi>l. per</hi> Month.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>What theſe Four Articles wou'd pay to the <hi>Exchequer</hi> yearly, 'twou'd be very difficult to calculate, and I am too near the End of this Book to attempt it: But I believe no Tax ever given ſince this War, has come near it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:0411500300:349"/>
'Tis true, out of this the Publick wou'd be to pay Half-Pay to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who ſhall be out of Employ, and all the Loſſes and Damages on Goods and Ships; which tho' it might be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, wou'd be ſmall, compar'd to the Payment aforeſaid; for as the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio</hi> of 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> is but ſmall, ſo the Safety lies upon all men being bound to Inſure: For I believe any one will grant me this, 'tis not the ſmallneſs of a Premio Ruins the Enſurer, but 'tis the ſmallneſs of the Quantity he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and I am not at all aſham'd to affirm, That let but a Premio of 4 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> be paid into one Man's hand for all Goods Imported and Exported, and any Man may be the General En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of the Kingdom, and yet that Premio can never hurt the Merchant neither.</p>
               <p>So that the vaſt Revenue this wou'd raiſe, wou'd be felt no where, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0411500300:350"/>
Poor nor Rich wou'd Pay the more for Coals; Foreign Goods wou'd be brought home cheaper, and our own Goods carri'd to Market cheaper; Owners wou'd get more by Ships, Merchants by Goods, and Loſſes by Sea wou'd be no Loſs at all to any Body, becauſe Repaid by the Publick Stock.</p>
               <p>Another unſeen Advantage wou'd ariſe by it, we ſhou'd be able to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work all our Neighbours, even the <hi>Dutch</hi> themſelves, by Sailing as cheap, and carrying Goods as cheap in a time of War as in Peace, an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which has more in it, than is eaſily thought of, and wou'd have a noble influence upon all our Foreign Trade. For what cou'd the <hi>Dutch</hi> do in Trade, if we cou'd carry our Goods to <hi>Cadiz</hi> at 50 <hi>s. per Ton</hi> Freight, and they give 8 or 10 <hi>l.</hi> and the like in other Places? Whereby we cou'd
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0411500300:351"/>
be able to Sell cheaper or get more thau our Neighbours.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral conſiderable clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes might be added to this Propoſal, ſome of great advantage to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Trade of the Kingdom, ſome to particular Trades, and more to the Publick; but I avoid being too Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in things which are but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of my own private Opinion.</p>
               <p>If the Government ſhou'd ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Experiment, no queſtion but much more than has been hinted at wou'd appear; nor do I ſee any great difficulty in the Attempt, or who wou'd be aggriev'd at it; and there I leave it, rather wiſhing than expecting to ſee it undertaken.</p>

            <head>The Concluſion.</head>
            <p>UPon a Review of the ſeveral Chapters of this Book, I find that inſtead of being able to go further, ſome things may have ſuffer'd for want of being fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd; which if any perſon object againſt, I only ſay, I cannot now avoid it: I have endeavour'd to keep to my Title, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd but at an <hi>Eſſay;</hi> which any one is at liberty to go on with as they pleaſe; for I can promiſe no Supplement. As to Errors of Opinion, tho' I am not yet convinc'd of any, yet I no where pretend to Infallibility: However, I do not willingly aſſert any thing which I have not good Grounds for. If I am miſtaken, let him that finds the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, inform the World better, and never trouble himſelf to animadvert upon this, ſince I aſſure him I ſhall not enter into any Pen and Ink Conteſt on the matter.</p>
            <p>As to Objections which may lye againſt any of the Propoſals made in this Book, I have in ſome places mention'd ſuch as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd to my Thoughts. I ſhall never aſſume that Arrogance to pretend no other or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0411500300:353"/>
Objections may be rais'd; but I do real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe no ſuch Objection can be rais'd, as will overthrow any Scheme here laid down, ſo as to render the thing impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Neither do I think but that all men will acknowledge moſt of the Propoſals in this Book would be of as great, and perhaps greater Advantage to the Publick, than I have pretended to.</p>
            <p>As for ſuch who read Books only to find out the Author's <hi>faux Pas,</hi> who will quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel at the Meanneſs of Stile, Errors of Pointing, Dulneſs of Expreſſion, or the like, I have but little to ſay to them; I thought I had corrected it very carefully, and yet ſome Miſpointings and ſmall Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors have ſlipt me, which 'tis too late to help: As to Language, I have been rather careful to make it ſpeak <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuitable to the Manner of the Story, than to dreſs it up with Exactneſs of Stile; chuſing rather to have it Free and Familiar, according to the Nature of <hi>Eſſays,</hi> than to ſtrain at a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Language, which I rather wiſh for than pretend to be Maſter of.</p>
