            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THESE home-travels are the firſt part of an account of my own country; and were actually performed in the year mentioned in the title page. The world juſtly loves the reality; therefore, this is mentioned to ſatisfy the public, that they are not formed out of tours undertaken at different periods.</p>
            <p>THESE make of themſelves a complete tour of the tamer parts of our country. In a future volume, the wild and romantic ſcenery will be preſented, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with the rich vallies ſo frequently interſperſed. To this will be added an Appendix, containing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects referred to in this volume, with variety of other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I implore the aid of my countrymen to aſſiſt me in the attempt; and to favor me with the neceſſary mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials. They will ſee, that great part of <hi>Denbighſhire,</hi> and all parts of the four remaining counties of our principality, are ſtill to be deſcribed. My frequent
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0181900401:3"/>
journies through them, render me a tolerable maſter of their topography. I look up to my friends for hiſtory and anecdote latent among their papers; or references to our writers, leaſt any facts lodged in books might eſcape my memory.</p>

            <head>THE TOUR IN NORTH WALES, MDCCLXXIII.</head>
            <p>I NOW ſpeak of my native country, celebrated in our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt hiſtory for its valour and tenacity of its liberty; for the ſtand it made againſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> for its ſlaughter of the legions<note n="*" place="bottom">Vita Agricolae.</note>; and for the ſubjection of the nation by <hi>Agricola,</hi> who did not dare to attempt his <hi>Caledonian</hi> expedition, and leave behind him unconquered ſo tremendous an enemy.</p>
            <p>WHEN our firſt invaders landed in <hi>Great Britain, North Wales</hi> was poſſeſſed by the <hi>Ordovices,</hi> a name derived from the language of the country, ſignifying the ſituation; being almoſt entirely bounded by the river <hi>Deva,</hi> or the modern <hi>Dee,</hi> and another river of the name of <hi>Dyvi</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Llwyd</hi> in <hi>Cambden</hi> II. 778.</note>. The one flows into the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſea below <hi>Cheſter,</hi> the other into the ſame ſea on the borders of <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſpirit which the people ſhewed at the beginning, did not deſert them to the laſt. Notwithſtanding they were obliged
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0181900401:10"/>
to ſubmit to the reſiſtleſs power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they never fell a prey to the enervating charms of luxury, as the other nations of this iſland did. They never, with womaniſh invocations, requeſted the aid of the deſerting conquerors, or ſunk beneath the preſſure of the new invaders; they preſerved an undaunted courage amidſt their native rocks, and received among them the gallant fugitives, happy in congenial ſouls. The hardy <hi>Saxons,</hi> for above three centuries, could not make an impreſſion even on our low lands. <hi>Offa</hi> was the firſt; who extended his kingdom for ſome miles within our borders. His conqueſt was but temporary; for we poſſeſſed <hi>Cheſter,</hi> the capital of the <hi>Cornavii,</hi> till the year 883, when it was wreſted from us by the united force of the Heptarchy beneath the able <hi>Egbert.</hi> This indeed reduced our confines; but did not ſubdue our ſpirit. With obdurate valour we ſuftained our independency for another four centuries, againſt the power of a kingdom more than twelve times larger than itſelf: and at length had the glory of falling, when a divided country, beneath the arms of the moſt wiſe, and moſt warlike of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs.</p>
            <p>I NATURALLY begin my journey from the place of my nativity,<note place="margin">FLINTSHIRE.</note> 
               <hi>Downing</hi> in the county of <hi>Flint.</hi> To give a general idea of this ſhire, the reader muſt learn, that it is leſt of the twelve <hi>Welch.</hi> Its northern ſide is waſhed by the eſtuary of the <hi>Dee,</hi> the <hi>Seteia Eſtuarium</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy.</hi> The land riſes ſuddenly from the ſhore in fine inequalities, clayey, and plenteous in corn and graſs, for two, three or four miles, to a montanous tract that runs parallel to it for a confiderable way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0181900401:11"/>THE lower part is divided by pictureſque dingles, which run from the mountains, and open to the ſea, filled with oaks. The inferior parts abound with coal and freeſtone; the upper with minerals of lead and calamine, and immenſe ſtrata of lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and chert. The principal trade of the country is mining and ſmelting.</p>
            <p>The northern part of the county is flat, and very rich in corn, eſpecially wheat, which is generally exported to <hi>Liverpool.</hi> The ſhire, in moſt places, raiſes more than is ſufficient for the uſe of the inhabitants. It is extremely populous; and in the mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts compoſed of a mixed people, whoſe fathers and grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers had reſorted here for ſake of employ out of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> mine counties; many of whoſe children, born of <hi>Welſh</hi> mothers, have quite loſt the language of their fathers.</p>
            <p>A LOFTY range of mountains riſe on the weſt, and form a bold frontier. Our county is watered by ſeveral ſmall rivers; ſuch as the <hi>Allen,</hi> the <hi>Terrig,</hi> and the <hi>Wheeler;</hi> part of its weſtern boundary by the <hi>Clwyd;</hi> and <hi>Maelwr,</hi> a disjoined part of the country, by the DEE.</p>
            <p>WE are ignorant of the claſſical name of this little province. The <hi>Ordovices,</hi> of which all weſt of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> was part, were ſubdivided in the time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in all probability, as the reſt of the country was. They had <hi>Reguli</hi> or Lords who ruled over little diſtricts, and united under a common leader when the exigencies of the time required. Theſe factions weakened the ſtate, ſeparated their intereſt, and facilitated their conqueſt by the firſt invaders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0181900401:12"/>THE names of theſe diſtricts are now unknown. <hi>Gwynedd</hi> is the moſt antient we are acquainted with for the country of <hi>North Wales.</hi> The portion I inhabit was called <hi>Tegangle,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hree modern hundreds of <hi>Coleſhill, Preſtatyn,</hi> and <hi>Rudland.</hi> The name is preſerved in the montanous parts of this pariſh, and ſome others, to this day called <hi>Mynnydd Tegang.</hi> I reject the tranſlation of <hi>Tegangle</hi> into <hi>Fair England,</hi> as a mongrel compound. The word is of a much more antient date; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing derived from <hi>Cangi</hi> or <hi>Ceangi,</hi> a ſet of people, according to the learned <hi>Baxter,</hi> belonging to every <hi>Britiſh</hi> nation; who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the herds and reſided with them in different grazing grounds at different times of the year. The neighboring <hi>Cornavii</hi> had their <hi>Ceangi,</hi> who wintered in <hi>Wiral,</hi> and took their ſummer reſidence in <hi>Tegangle;</hi> a word to be properly derived on that account from <hi>Teg,</hi> fair, <hi>Cang,</hi> the name of the people, and <hi>Lle,</hi> a place. To corroborate which, at this very day is a plain in the pariſh of <hi>Caerwys,</hi> a part of the old <hi>Tegangle,</hi> adjoining to this mountain, that ſtill retains the title of <hi>Maes can havod,</hi> or the plain of the hundred ſummer reſidences. For this reaſon I preſume to differ from Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his notion of the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reſidence of theſe <hi>Cangi.</hi> He places it near the <hi>Canganorum Promontorium,</hi> or <hi>Braich y pwll</hi> head in <hi>Caernarvonſhire;</hi> but thoſe were the <hi>Cangi</hi> of the <hi>Ordovices,</hi> theſe of the <hi>Cornavii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT may be remarked, that, contrary to what happens to moſt ſubdued nations, our country preſerved its own language: and the conquerors even deigned to adopt the names of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> towns and people, latinizing them from the original words. Thus <hi>Londinium</hi> from LUNDEIN, <hi>i. e.</hi> LLONG DIN or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0181900401:13"/>
DINAS, <hi>the city of ſhips</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Cambden I. 370.</note>, from its conſiderable commerce; DEVA from its ſituation on the river <hi>Deva</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Or</hi> Dyſi.</note>; DUNMONII from <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnyn,</hi> or <hi>the hill of ore;</hi> BRIGANTES from <hi>Brig,</hi> choice or chief men; <hi>Coritani,</hi> or rather <hi>Coitani,</hi> from <hi>Coed,</hi> a wood<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mr. Pegge.</note>. On the retreat of their <hi>Roman</hi> maſters, the latinized names were dropt, except in a very few inſtances, and their own reſumed; but the reſt of the <hi>Britons,</hi> who ſubmitted to the <hi>Saxon</hi> yoke, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally received with it the names of places from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors.</p>
            <p>THE whole of <hi>Flintſhire</hi> was ſubdued by the <hi>Saxons</hi> immediately after the taking of <hi>Cheſter</hi> by <hi>Egbert.</hi> It was an open country, deſtitute of inacceſſible rocks and mountains, like the reſt of <hi>North Wales;</hi> and conſequently incapable of defence againſt ſo potent an enemy. The conquerors, as uſual, new-named the towns, villages, and hamlets; but could not cancel the antient. Thus <hi>Hawarden</hi> ſtill is known to the <hi>Welſh</hi> by the name of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardd Lâg,</hi> or <hi>Halawg; Mold</hi> by that of <hi>Wyddgryg;</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> by that of <hi>Eſtyn;</hi> which (with the continuance of our language to this day) proves that even at that time it mixed but little with our conquerors. Numbers of <hi>Saxons</hi> were ſettled among us, who held their lands from the <hi>Mercian</hi> governors or earls: we find in the Doomſday book many of their names who had poſſeſſions in this tract; ſuch as <hi>Ulbert, Oſmer,</hi> and <hi>Elmer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE firſt notice of any ſub-diviſion of the tract called <hi>Flint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">DOOMSDAY BOOK.</note> appears in the <hi>Doomſday</hi> book. When that ſurvey was taken, it was made a part of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> to which it was conſidered as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0181900401:14"/>
an appendage, by conqueſt. Old records affirm, that <hi>the county of</hi> FLINT <hi>appertaineth to the dignity of the ſword of</hi> CHESTER. It was ſoon ſubdued by <hi>Robert de Rothelent,</hi> commander in chief under <hi>Hugh Lupus,</hi> who carried his arms far into <hi>Wales;</hi> and ſecured his conqueſts in the marches by building, or rather by adding new works to the caſtle of <hi>Rudland,</hi> which he had wreſted from one of our princes.</p>
            <p>THE tract from <hi>Cheſter</hi> to the <hi>Clwyd</hi> was then conſidered as a hundred of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and called in the Doomſday Book <hi>Atiſcros</hi> hundred. Numbers of places ſtill exiſting are mentioned in it, diſguiſed often by the <hi>Norman</hi> ſpelling. <hi>Whiteford,</hi> the place in queſtion, is called <hi>Widford:</hi> notice is alſo taken of ſome of the preſent townſhips, ſuch as <hi>Tre-moſtyn, Tre-bychton,</hi> and <hi>Merton,</hi> under the names of <hi>Moſtone, Widſord, Putecaine,</hi> and <hi>Meretone.</hi> MOSTONE was then a <hi>plough-land, terra unius Carucae.</hi> It had on it four villeyns and eight boors; (<hi>Bordarii</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Borda ſignifies a cottage, with a ſmall piece of land annexed, held by the ſervice of finding for the lord, poultry, eggs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for his <hi>bwrdd,</hi> or table.</note>,) a wood a league long, and forty perches, <hi>particatae,</hi> broad, and was valued at twenty ſhillings.</p>
            <p>WIDFORD is joined with <hi>Putecaine:</hi> The firſt ſeems to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended our preſent <hi>Trelan,</hi> or the place where the church-village now ſtands. Theſe had one plough-land, two villeyns, and twelve others between men and maid ſervants, fiſheries, and a wood half a league long and forty perches broad; the value was the ſame with that of <hi>Moſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITH <hi>Meretone</hi> is joined the third part of <hi>Widford;</hi> and the <hi>Berewicha</hi> or hamlet of <hi>Caldecote,</hi> the laſt at preſent a townſhip
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0181900401:15"/>
of the pariſh of <hi>Holywell.</hi> In this diviſion was a preſbyter, a church, and ſix villeyns. Here was a wood half a league long and twenty perches broad. One <hi>Odin</hi> held theſe of the earl.</p>
            <p>AT the time of the conqueſt, all this tract of <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> which was called by the <hi>Saxons Englefield,</hi> and afterwards by the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Atiſcros,</hi> was in poſſeſſion of <hi>Edwin,</hi> the laſt Earl of <hi>Mercia;</hi> and on his defeat and forfeiture, beſtowed, with the earldom of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> on <hi>Hugh Lupus.</hi> The whole was in a manner depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and reduced to a waſte, I imagine by the two inroads made into thoſe parts by <hi>Harold,</hi> at the command of <hi>Edward</hi> the confeſſor, to revenge on <hi>Griffith ap Lhewelyn</hi> the inſult offered him, by giving protection to <hi>Algar,</hi> one of his rebellious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Powell,</hi> 100.</note>.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable, that there were only ſeven churches at that time in the whole hundred: 1. <hi>Haordine,</hi> the preſent <hi>Hawardin;</hi> 2. <hi>Widford;</hi> 3. <hi>Biſſard, Boteuuaral,</hi> and <hi>Ruagor;</hi> 4. <hi>Inglecroft, Brunfor,</hi> and <hi>Alchene;</hi> 5. <hi>Danfrond, Calſton,</hi> and <hi>Weſbie;</hi> 6. <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetone</hi> and <hi>Rueſtoch;</hi> and finally, the 7th at <hi>Roelend;</hi> beſides one that lay waſte at <hi>Cancarnacan</hi> and <hi>Wheneſcol.</hi> Parochial diviſions had not yet taken place. Mr. <hi>Agard</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Antiquary Diſcourſes, I. 194.</note>, a writer in the latter end of the ſixteenth century, remarks, that the old hiſtorians make no mention of either pariſhes, parſons, vicars, incumbents, or curates. The people attended, in thoſe days, either the cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral churches, or the conventual; which were ſerved by the prelates or monks, and thoſe often aſſiſted by preſbyters, clerks,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0181900401:16"/>
and deacons. As piety gained ſtrength, other churches, for the conveniency of the devout, were erected by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and men of property, who were deſirous of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual aſſiſtance within their precincts; and to this were owing the churches, which, at the period in queſtion, were ſo ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſcattered over the land. The places which enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this advantage had the title of <hi>Lhan</hi> prefixed; as that of <hi>Tre,</hi> which ſignifies primitively a habitation, is to the town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips.</p>
            <p>THUS in our pariſh is <hi>Tre-moſtyn,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">TRE-MOSTYN.</note> remarkable for the antient ſeat of the family of the ſame name, which acquired it by the marriage of <hi>Jevan Vychan</hi> with <hi>Angharad,</hi> heireſs of <hi>Howel ap Ithel Vychan</hi> of <hi>Moſtyn,</hi> in the reign of <hi>Richard</hi> II. The great gloomy hall is of very old date, furniſhed with the high <hi>Dais,</hi> or elevated upper end, and its long table for the lord and his jovial companions; and another in the ſide, the ſeat of the inferior partakers of the good cheer. The walls are furniſhed, in a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner, with antient militia guns, ſwords, and pikes; with helmets and breaſt plates; with funereal atchievements; and with variety of ſpoils of the chace. A falcon is nailed againſt the upper end of the room, with two bells hung to each foot. With theſe incumbrances it flew from its owner, a gentleman in the county of <hi>Angus,</hi> on the morning of the twenty-fourth of <hi>September</hi> 1772, and was killed near this houſe on the morning of the twenty-ſixth. The preciſe time it reached our country is not known; therefore we are uncertain whether this bird exceeded in ſwiftneſs the hawk which flew thirty miles in an hour in purſuit of a woodcock; or that which made a flight out of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0181900401:17"/>
into <hi>Pruſſia</hi> in a day: inſtances recorded<note n="*" place="bottom">Miſcellany Tracts, Tr. V. p. 38.</note> by the learned Sir <hi>Thomas Brown.</hi> The adjacent kitchen is overlooked by a gallery leading to the antient apartments of the lady of the houſe, at a period when the odours of the pot and ſpit were thought no ill ſavours. At one end of the gallery is a great room, remarkable for a ſingular event. During the time that <hi>Henry</hi> earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> was ſecretly laying the foundation of the overthrow of the houſe of <hi>York,</hi> he paſſed concealed from place to place, in order to form an intereſt among the <hi>Welſh,</hi> who favored his cauſe on account of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his granfather, <hi>Owen Tudor,</hi> their countryman. While he was at <hi>Moſtyn,</hi> a party attached to <hi>Richard</hi> III. arrived there to apprehend him. He was then about to dine; but had juſt time to leap out of a back window, and make his eſcape through a hole, which to this day is called the <hi>King</hi>'s. <hi>Richard ap Howel,</hi> then lord of <hi>Moſtyn,</hi> joined <hi>Henry</hi> at the battle of <hi>Boſworth,</hi> and after the victory received from the King, in token of gratitude for his preſervation, the belt and ſword he wore on the day: he alſo preſſed <hi>Richard</hi> greatly to follow him to court; but he nobly anſwered, like the <hi>Shunamitiſh</hi> widow, <hi>I dwell among mine own people.</hi> The ſword and belt were preſerved in the houſe till within theſe few years. It is obſervable, that none of our hiſtorians account for a certain period of <hi>Henry</hi>'s life, previous to his acceſſion. It is very evident, that he paſſed the times, when he diſappeared from <hi>Bretagny,</hi> in <hi>Wales.</hi> Many cotemporary bards, by feigned names, record this part of his life, under thoſe of the LION, the EAGLE, and the like, which were to reſtore the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0181900401:18"/>
empire to the <hi>Britons:</hi> for the inſpired favorers of the houſe of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> did not dare to deliver their verſes in other than terms allegorical, for fear of the reigning prince.</p>
            <p>THERE is little more remarkable about the houſe than what is common to others built at different times. Here are two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable portraits; one of Sir <hi>Roger Moſtyn,</hi> knight, with a white beard and locks, in black, with great breeches ſtuck round the waiſt-band with points. This piece of magnificence gave riſe to a very coarſe proverb, applied to inferior people ambitious of acting beyond their ſtation. The other portrait is of his Lady, <hi>Mary,</hi> eldeſt daughter of Sir <hi>John Wynne</hi> of <hi>Gwedir,</hi> baronet. Both are full lengths, dated 1634, and I think painted by <hi>Mytens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE is another picture, not leſs remarkable for its ridiculous compoſition, than for the diſtinguiſhed perſon painted in it. A kit-cat length of Sir <hi>Roger Moſtyn,</hi> the firſt baronet; in a ſtrange long flaxen wig, a breaſt-plate, buff ſkirts, and antique <hi>Roman</hi> ſleeves; a black holding his helmet; his lady reading, with one hand on a ſcull; and by her huſband a lap-dog. This gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was the moſt eminent loyaliſt of our county: raiſed a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſupport of the crown, conſiſting of fifteen hundred men, in twelve hours time<note n="*" place="margin">Whitelock, 78.</note>, moſtly colliers; and garriſoned his houſe, which, in <hi>September</hi> 1643, was ſurrendered to the parlemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary forces, with four pieces of cannon and ſome arms<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE buſts collected in <hi>Italy</hi> deſerve mention.<note place="margin">BUSTS.</note> That of the elder <hi>Brutus</hi> is particularly fine, as if formed in the inſtant that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0181900401:19"/>
the love of his country got the better of paternal affection; when with a ſteady voice he was delivering to the lictors his <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius,</hi> to receive the reward of their treaſons.</p>
            <p>A BEAUTIFUL head of a young faun in a <hi>Phrygian</hi> bonnet.</p>
            <p>A FINE head of one of the <hi>Cornelii.</hi> An <hi>Homer,</hi> and an <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates.</hi> A <hi>Seleucus,</hi> with two wings faſtened to an imperial dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem; ſymbols of diſpatch and expedition. Two buſts in brown alabaſter of a male and female faun, with the <hi>flammeum</hi> on their heads: both are of hideous deformity; but well executed. Here are beſides a few ſmall monumental marbles, with inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the antiquarian reader may find in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix.</p>
            <p>IN the Library is a moſt elegant collection of the claſſics,<note place="margin">LIBRARY.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining variety of the moſt antient and rare editions; a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous collection of books relating to the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, eſpecially thoſe which comprehend the medallic hiſtory; variety of manuſcripts, moſtly on vellum, and many of them richly illuminated. In a few words, ſcarce any private library can boaſt of ſo valuable an aſſemblage; which remain indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable evidences of the taſte and judgment of that excellent man, its accompliſhed founder, the late Sir THOMAS MOSTYN.

This is of an elegant form and ſculpture: is twelve feet high, two feet four inches broad at the bottom, and ten inches thick. The baſe is let into another ſtone. The top is round, and includes, in raiſed work, the form of a <hi>Greek</hi> croſs: beneath, about the middle, is another in the form of St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s: and under that, a naked figure, with a ſpear in its hand.

I do not preſume (after the annotator on <hi>Cambden</hi> has given up the point) to attempt a gueſs at the age.

            <p>THOSE, who ſuppoſe it to have been erected in memory of the dead ſlain in battle on the ſpot, draw their argument from the number of adjacent <hi>tumuli,</hi> containing human bones, and ſculls often marked with mortal wounds; but theſe earthy ſepulchres are of more antient times than the elegant ſculpture of this pillar will admit.

This, and the other lower parts of the pariſh, are finely wooded with oaks; which grow ſo ſpontaneouſly, that, was the place depopulated, it would in a very few years relapſe into an impenetrable foreſt.</p>

            <p>THE products of this pariſh are corn of every ſort excepting rye. Little cheeſe or butter is made here for ſale, as the graſs is chiefly conſumed by horſes; for the farmers are greatly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in carrying the minerals of the country: the ſame may be ſaid of the ſhire in general. Every cottager has his potatoe garden, which is a great ſupport to them; and was a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency unknown fifty years ago. The lower parts are well wooded; and much timber is at times ſold to <hi>Leverpool</hi> and other places, at good prices; much is alſo uſed at home in the mines.</p>
            <p>THE collieries of <hi>Moſtyn</hi> and <hi>Bychton</hi> have been worked for a very conſiderable ſpace;<note place="margin">COAL.</note> and in the laſt century ſupplied <hi>Dublin</hi> and the eaſtern ſide of <hi>Ireland</hi> with coal.

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Henry II.</note>.</p>
            <p>HENRY II. in 1157, after his eſcape from the ambuſcade of <hi>Eulo,</hi> left <hi>Baſingwerk</hi> reſtored, well fortified, and manned<note n="†" place="bottom">M.Paris, 129.</note>, in order to ſecure a retreat on any future diſaſter. He did the ſame by the caſte of <hi>Rudland.</hi> In his days the inland parts of our county were a dangerous wild of foreſt. After his defeat he never truſted himſelf among our woods; but made his marches along the open ſhores.</p>
            <p>THE ſame monarch left another ſpecies of garriſon<note n="‡" place="bottom">Powel, 208.</note>; for he eſtabliſhed here a houſe of knights templars, a military order introduced into <hi>England</hi> in the preceding reign. They were firſt inſtituted in the Holy Land for the protection of pilgrims; and poſſibly <hi>Henry</hi> might have, the ſame view in fixing them here, to ſecure the <hi>Engliſh</hi> devotees in performing their vows to our neighboring ſaint, who ſeems about this time to have come into reputation. It is ſingular, that theſe religious knights were allowed at their inſtitution only one horſe between two; yet ſo greatly did they flouriſh, that about the year 1240, or a hundred and fifty years after their inſtitution, the order had acquired, in different parts of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> nineteen thouſand manors.</p>
            <p>THIS caſtle was but of very ſhort duration; for in 1165, the gallant prince <hi>Owen Gwynedd</hi> laid ſiege to it, took<note n="§" place="bottom">The ſame, 223.</note> and levelled it to the ground; after which the name occurs no more as a

Fortreſs. I think at this period it belonged to <hi>Hugh de Bello Campo,</hi> or <hi>Beauchamp,</hi> on whom this and <hi>Rudland</hi> caſtle had been beſtowed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> monarch<note n="*" place="bottom">Annales Waverleienſes. 159.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE abby<note n="†" place="bottom">Called alſo by the <hi>Welſh, Maes-glas,</hi> or <hi>Greenfield.</hi>
               </note>,<note place="margin">ABBY.</note> of which there are ſome conſiderable remains, was founded in 1131 (according to the opinion of Biſhop <hi>Tanner)</hi> by <hi>Randle</hi> the ſecond earl of <hi>Cheſter:</hi> according to Biſhop Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, by <hi>Henry</hi> II. For my part, I believe it to be of greater antiquity; but do not pretend to derive its origin. No light into the matter can be collected from the charters preſerved by Sir <hi>William Dugdale.</hi>
There are three of them, either ſerving to confirm the antient donations, or confer new: in each is mention of the earl as a benefactor; but there is not the left hint of his having been the founder. I muſt attribute that honor to one of the princes of <hi>Wales;</hi> for both <hi>Lhewelyn ap Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werth,</hi> and his ſon <hi>David,</hi> in their reſpective charters recite, that they give and confirm the ſeveral donations to GOD, St.<hi>Mary,</hi> the monaſtery of <hi>Baſingwerk,</hi> and the monks, which had been beſtowed on them by their predeceſſors for the ſalvation of their ſouls.</p>
            <p>RANDAL was certainly a great benefactor; for it appears, that before his days the monks had only a chapel here. From that period it became conſiderable; and about that time part of the preſent buildings were erected, for the conveniency of its inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, who were of the <hi>Ciſtorcian</hi> order.</p>
            <p>THE architecture is mixed. Here appears what is called <hi>Saxon;</hi> having the round arches and ſhort columns in ſome parts; and the</p>

            <p>THE church lay on the eaſt ſide; but is now totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. The refectory is pretty entire; and on one ſide has a great receſs, with two round arches and a plain in front.</p>
            <p>ABOVE were the cells for the lodgings of the monks, with a ſmall window to each.</p>
            <p>THE chapel of the knights templars is a ſpacious building. The windows are long, narrow, and pointed; the pilaſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them on the inſide ſlender and elegant.</p>
            <p>THERE are ſome remains of offices, uſed at preſent by a tanner. Within leſs than fifty years, much of the habitable part was ſtanding; and ſometimes uſed by the worthy family, the <hi>Moſtyns</hi> of <hi>Trelacre:</hi> a lady now living was born within the walls.</p>

            <p>HE ſpeaks alſo of his works of utility; of the water and of the windmills he erected. Neither is he ſilent on a ſubject, pleaſing to every <hi>Welſh</hi> ear, the pedigree of his patron; whom he derives from <hi>Edwin</hi> and from <hi>Elidir ap Rhys Sais,</hi> a direct deſcendant from <hi>Tudor Trevor</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE laſt abbot conformed, and married <hi>Angared</hi> daughter to <hi>Gwillim ap Gryſſydd ap Gwillim.</hi> The <hi>Harleian</hi> MS. calls him Sir <hi>Thomas Pennant.</hi> The remains of a very antient oak, ſtill to be ſeen near the ruins of the houſe, is called the abbot's, and is ſuppoſed to be his cotemporary.</p>
            <p>THE road from hence is remarkably pictureſque, along a little valley, bounded on one ſide by hanging woods, beneath which the ſtream hurries towards the ſea, unleſs where interrupted by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent manufactories.

Immediately over the fountain is the legend of St. <hi>Wenefrede,</hi> on a pendent projection, with the arms of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at the bottom. Numbers of fine ribs ſecure the arch, whoſe interſections are coupled with ſome ſculpture.</p>
            <p>SOME are mere works of fancy; groteſque figures of animals: but the reſt allude chiefly to the <hi>Stanley</hi> family. This building, and the chapel over it, roſe from the piety of that great houſe, who left theſe memorials of their benefactions: there are beſides ſome marks of illuſtrious donors; for example, the profile of <hi>Margaret,</hi> mother to <hi>Henry</hi> VII. and that of her huſband the earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> cut on the ſame ſtone.</p>
            <p>THE compliments to the <hi>Stanlies</hi> are very frequent. The <hi>wolf</hi>'s head is the arms of the earls of <hi>Cheſter:</hi> it is incloſed in a garter, in reſpect to Sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> knight of that order, who had been chamberlain of that city, and juſticiary of <hi>North Wales.</hi> The tun with a plant iſſuing out of it, is a <hi>rebus,</hi> the arms of his wife <hi>Elizabeth Hopton,</hi> alluſive to her name. This proves, that the building was erected before 1495, in which year Sir <hi>William</hi> loſt his head. The other badges of the ſame houſe are, the ſtag's head; the eagle's leg; and the three legs, the arms of the iſle of <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE alſo find, that <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> widow to prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> and afterwards the unfortunate wife of his brother <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. was a benefactreſs to this building; at leſt her arms appear here: three pomegranates in a ſhield, ſurmounted with a crown; the badge of the houſe of <hi>Granada,</hi> in memory of the

expulſion of the Moors, by her father <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Sandford's Geneal. 475.</note>. The eagle ſeems alſo to belong to her, being one of the ſupporters of the arms of her family.</p>
            <p>OVER one of the leſſer arches, on each ſide of the well, are the dragon and gre-hound, the ſupporters of the arms of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> during the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. and part of that of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. The firſt was born by <hi>Henry</hi> VII. as a badge of the houſe of <hi>Tudor,</hi> which derived itſelf from <hi>Cadwalader,</hi> laſt king of <hi>Britain,</hi> who bore on his enſign a red dragon. <hi>Henry,</hi> in imitation of him, at the battle of <hi>Boſworth</hi> carried on his ſtandard a red dragon, painted on white and green ſilk; which afterwards gave riſe to the office of <hi>Rouge dragon</hi> among the heralds.</p>
            <p>ON one ſide of a wall that ſupports the roof, was painted the tale of the tutelar ſaint; at preſent almoſt defaced: over it is inſcribed, <hi>in honorem Sanctae Wenefredae,</hi> V. &amp; M.</p>
            <p>IN another wall is an elegant nich, in which ſtood a ſtatue of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> pulled down, as I have been informed, in the year 1635.</p>
            <p>I have alſo heard, that there had been another of St. <hi>Wene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frede.</hi> To grace the image on high feſtivals, it is probable, that <hi>Iſabel,</hi> counteſs of <hi>Warwick,</hi> widow to the great <hi>Richard Beauchamp,</hi> left to St. <hi>Wenefrede,</hi> in 1439, her gown of ruſſet velvet<note n="†" place="bottom">Dugdale's Warwickſhire, I. 414.</note>.</p>
            <p>OVER this ſpring is a chapel,<note place="margin">CHAPEL.</note> of the ſame date with the other building: a neat piece of gothic architecture; but in a very ruinous ſtate. This had been a free chapel, in the gift of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0181900401:45"/>
biſhop, with the reſerve of a ſtipend to the chapter; but the reſt of the offerings were to be expended on the chapel. In <hi>Richard</hi> III.'s time, the abbot and convent had from the crown ten marks <hi>yerely, for the ſuſtentacione and ſalarie of a prieſte, at the chapelle of St. Wyneſride</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Harleian <hi>MSS.</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 433, 338.</note>. The chapel is the property of <hi>John Davies</hi> eſquire, of <hi>Llanerch.</hi> The well is common; for I find by a deciſion of the court of chancery, on a law-ſuit reſpecting the lordſhip of <hi>Holywell,</hi> between Sir <hi>John Egerton</hi> knight, and <hi>John Eldred;</hi> chancellor <hi>Elleſmere</hi> decrees, <q>That on calling to mind, that within the ſaid manor there is a fountain or well of antient and worthy memory, he doth not think fit that the petitioner, or any other, ſhould have the property thereof, notwithſtanding the general words of the grant of the manor: and therefore his lordſhip doth order, that notwithſtanding the ſaid grant, that the well ſhall continue as now it is, or heretofore hath been; ſaving to the petitioner, and his heirs and aſſigns, the benefit of the ſtream and watercourſe, with the appertainances.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THERE are two different opinions about the origin of this ſtream. One party makes it miraculous: the other aſſert it to be owing only to natural cauſes. The advocates for the firſt, deliver their tale thus:</p>
            <p>IN the ſeventh century lived a virgin of the name of <hi>Weneſrede,</hi>

After completing this work of piety, he viſited his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> and obtaining from his brother-in-law a little ſpot at the foot of the hill on which he reſided, erected on it a church; and took under his care his niece <hi>Wenefrede.</hi> A neighboring prince of the name of <hi>Cradocus,</hi> ſon of King <hi>Alen,</hi> was ſtruck with her beauty, and at all events determined to gratify his deſires. He made known his paſſion to the lady; who, affected with horror, attempted to eſcape. The wretch, enraged at the diſappointment, inſtantly purſued her, drew out his ſabre, and cut off her head. <hi>Cradocus</hi> inſtantly received the reward of his crime: he fell down dead, and the earth opening, ſwallowed his impious corps. <hi>Hidgen,</hi> in his <hi>Polychronicon</hi> adds, that even the deſcendents of this monſter were viſited with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible judgments, to be expiated only by a viſit to this well, or to the bones of the ſaint at <hi>Salop.</hi>

            <p>ST. BEUNO took up the head, carried it to the corps, and, offering up his devotions, joined it nicely to the body, which inſtantly re-united. The place was viſible only by a ſlender white line encircling her neck, in memory of a miracle, which ſurpaſſed far that worked by St. <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> who marched in triumph after decapitation, with his head in his hands, from <hi>Mont martre</hi> to St. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s<note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſtoire de l'abbaye de St. Denys, 76.</note> or that of St. <hi>Adelbertus,</hi> who, in like circumſtances, ſwam acroſs the <hi>Viſtula.</hi>

            <p>TO conclude: St. <hi>Wenefrede</hi> ſurvived her decollation fifteen years. She died at <hi>Gwytherin</hi> in <hi>Denbighſhire,</hi> where her bones
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0181900401:48"/>
reſted till the reign of king <hi>Stephen;</hi> when, after divine admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, they were ſurrendered to the abby of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Shrewſbury.</hi> The memory of the two great events, that of her firſt death is celebrated on the 22d of <hi>June:</hi> that of her tranſlation the 3d of <hi>November.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A FRATERNITY and gild was eſtabliſhed in honor of our faint at <hi>Shrewſbury.</hi> It had its common ſeal, which, through the kindneſs of my friend, Mr. <hi>Henry Levingſton,</hi> is now in my poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. It is of copper, of the form expreſſed in the plate. In the centre is a repreſentation of the martyrdom; above is a croſs in form of a T, placed between the letters <hi>T. m.</hi> which mark the time when the fraternity was inſtituted, during the abbacy of <hi>Thomas Mynde;</hi> who was elected in 1459, and died in 1499, a period in which theſe religious ſocieties were much in faſhion. The T or croſs refers to the church of <hi>St. Croſs</hi> within this monaſtery. Beneath are probably the arms of the houſe, a ſword and a key, ſymbols of its tutelar apoſtles; and round the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin is this inſcription:</p>
            <q>

            </q>
            <p>A bell belonging to the church was alſo chriſtened in honor of her. I cannot learn the names of the goſſips, who, as uſual, were doubtleſsly rich perſons. On the ceremony, they all laid hold of the rope; beſtowed a name on the bell; and the prieſt ſprinkling it with holy water, baptized it in the name of the Father, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>

which the prieſt received in behalf of the bell. Thus bleſſed, it was endowed with great powers; allayed (on being rung) all ſtorms; diverted the thunder-bolt; drove away evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Theſe conſecrated bells were always inſcribed. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription on that in queſtion ran thus:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Sancta <hi>Wenefreda,</hi> Deo hoc commendare memento,</l>

            </q>
            <p>And a little lower was another addreſs:</p>

            </q>
            <p>AFTER her death, her ſanctity, ſays her hiſtorian, was proved by numberleſs miracles. The waters were almoſt as ſanative as thoſe of the pool of <hi>Betheſda:</hi> all infirmities incident to the human body met with relief; the votive crutches, the barrows, and other proofs of cures, to this moment remain as evidences pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent over the well. The ſaint is equally propitious to Proteſtants and Catholics; for among the offerings are to be found theſe grateful teſtimonies from the patients of each religion.</p>

            <p>WE, whoſe anceſtors, between two and three centuries ago, abridged our faith to the mere contents of the Old and New Teſtament, and to the creed called the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> do not think
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0181900401:51"/>
the belief in the above, and other legends, requiſite. I refer the reader to the arguments uſed by the antiquary Doctor <hi>Powel,</hi> in his notes on the Itinerary of <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis,</hi> and to biſhop <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s annotations on the life of the ſaint, for proofs againſt the truth of the tale: but with Proteſtants, and temperate Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, it carries with it ſelf-confutation.</p>
            <p>THE waters are indiſputably endowed with every good quality attendant on cold baths; and multitudes have here experienced the good effects that thus reſult from natural qualities, implanted in the ſeveral parts of matter by the divine Providence in order to fulfil his will. Heaven for a ſhort period deigned to convince a dark and obdurate age with a ſeries of miracles; which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered down to ſucceeding times, as inconteſtible proofs of the reality of the divine miſſion. Without them, a ſufficient ground of truſt and reliance upon the Supreme Being has long ſince been eſtabliſhed. Second cauſes innumerable are diſperſed throughout the univerſe, ſubordinate to the FIRST. Every element proves to us a medicine or a bane, as ſuits His unerring diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We cannot want, we cannot have the mediation of poor departed mortals. The ſuppoſition would be beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them the attributes of the Deity; omnipreſence and omniſcience.</p>
            <p>SOME eminent botaniſts of my acquaintance have reduced the ſweet moſs,<note place="margin">MOSSES</note> and the bloody ſtains, to mere vegetable produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, far from being peculiar to our fountain. The firſt is that kind of moſs called a <hi>Jungermannia,</hi> imperfectly deſcribed and figured by <hi>Dillenius,</hi> in his hiſtory of moſſes; which has induced us to give a new engraving of it. This ſpecies is alſo found in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0181900401:52"/>
another holy well in <hi>Caernarvonſhire,</hi> called <hi>Ffynnon Llandeniolen,</hi> in a pariſh of the ſame name.</p>
            <p>THE other is a <hi>Byſſus,</hi> likewiſe odoriferous: common to <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and to other countries beſides our own. It adheres to ſtones in form of fine velvet. <hi>Linnaeus</hi> calls it <hi>Byſſus Jolithus</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Sp. Pl. II. 1638. Fl. lap. 369. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 528.</note>, or the violet-ſmelling. He ſays, the ſtone to which it adheres eaſily betrays itſelf by the color, being as if ſmeared with blood; and if rubbed, yields a ſmell like violets. <hi>Micheli,</hi> in his <hi>Genera</hi> of plants, mentions the ſame<note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. 210. tab. 89. fig. 3.</note>; and <hi>Schwenckſelt</hi> diſcovered it among the vegetables of <hi>Sileſia.</hi> He calls it a <hi>muſcus ſubrubeus,</hi> and informs us, that the ſmell is grateful to the heart; and that, if put among cloaths, it gives them a good ſcent, and ſerves to drive away moths<note n="‡" place="bottom">Cat.

            <p>ABOVE the well ſtands the church, dedicated to St. <hi>Wenefrede.</hi> The pariſh wakes are celebrated in <hi>November,</hi> the time of her tranſlation. The living, before the diſſolution, belonged to the abby of <hi>Baſingwerk;</hi> and is a vicarage in the gift of <hi>Jeſus College Oxford,</hi> which nominates; and <hi>John Davies</hi> eſquire, of <hi>Llanerch,</hi> the lay-rector, preſents.</p>
            <p>ABOVE the church is a hill called <hi>Bryn y Caſtell,</hi> narrow, and very ſteep on the ſides, projecting at the end over the little valley. On this might have ſtood the caſtle of <hi>Treffynnon,</hi> or St. <hi>Wenefrede,</hi> built by <hi>Randle</hi> III. earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> in the year 1210 <note n="‖" place="bottom">Powel, 262.</note>. There are not at preſent any veſtiges left.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0181900401:53"/>IT is ſingular, that no mention is made in the Doomſday book of either chapel, church, or well; yet townſhips now of leſs note are named; ſuch as <hi>Brunford Caldecote,</hi> and others. Notwithſtanding biſhop <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s opinion, I think the legend of St. <hi>Wenefrede</hi> was known previous to that ſurvey; for the very name of <hi>Holywell</hi> is <hi>Saxon,</hi> probably beſtowed on it before the Conqueſt, on account of the imputed ſanctity of the well.</p>
            <p>THE ſpring is certainly one of the fineſt in theſe kingdoms; and, by the two different trials and calculations lately made for my information, is found to fling out about twenty-one tons of water in a minute. It never freezes; or ſcarcely varies in the quantity of water, in droughts or after the greateſt rains. After a violent fall of wet, it becomes diſcolored by a wheyey tinge.</p>
            <p>THE ſtream formed by this fountain runs with a rapid courſe to the ſea, which it reaches in little more than a mile's diſtance. The induſtry of this century hath made its waters of much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial utility. The principal works on it at this time are bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering mills for copper; a wire-mill, coarſe paper mill, ſnuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill, a foundery for braſs; and at this time, a cotton manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory is eſtabliſhing, the ſucceſs of which will be an extenſive bleſſing to the neighborhood.</p>
            <p>DURING the reign of pilgrimages, nothing but a corn-mill or two, the property of the monks, found employ for this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial ſtream.</p>
            <p>THE town was alſo very inconſiderable till the beginning of this century; the houſes few, and thoſe for the moſt part
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0181900401:54"/>
thatched; the ſtreets unpaved; and the place deſtitute of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. The flouriſhing mines, that for ſome time were diſcovered in the neighborhood, made a great change in the appearance, and introduced the effects of wealth. The town, or rather townſhip, contains ſomewhat more than two thouſand ſouls.</p>
            <p>THE monks of <hi>Baſingwerk</hi> obtained for it the grant of a fair and a market. The firſt has been dropt beyond the memory of man. The market was alſo loſt, till it was renewed by letters patent, dated <hi>Jan.</hi> 20th, 1703, granted to Sir <hi>John Egerton</hi> baronet. The patent alſo contains a grant of three fairs, <hi>viz.</hi> on the 23d of <hi>April,</hi> the <hi>Tueſday</hi> in <hi>Eaſter</hi> week, and the 2d of <hi>September.</hi> The market has been the moſt flouriſhing in <hi>North Wales;</hi> but the fairs never could be eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>THE ſituation of the town is pleaſant and healthy. On the back is a lofty hill, at times extremely productive of lead ore. Towards the ſea is a pretty valley, bounded by woods: the end finiſhes on one ſide with the venerable abby. To ſuch who requ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>MY next viſit was to <hi>Flint.</hi> I took the lower road, by the ſhore, blackened with the ſmoke of ſmelting-houſes; and, in the more flouriſhing times of the collieries, with vaſt ſtacks of coal. The laſt townſhip in <hi>Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0181900401:55"/>
Conqueſt four villeyns, two boors, and a <hi>Radman.</hi> This laſt ſeems to have been the ſame with the <hi>Rod</hi> or <hi>Rad-knights,</hi> who, by the tenure of their lands, were bound to ride with or for their lord, as often as his affairs required.</p>
            <p>AFTER croſſing a ſmall brook, enter the town of FLINT:<note place="margin">FLINT.</note> a place laid out with great regularity; but the ſtreets far from being completed. The removal of the greater and the leſſer ſeſſions, and its want of trade, will be farther checks to its improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This town gave name to the county, which, with that of <hi>Caernarvon, Merioneth,</hi> and <hi>Angleſey,</hi> compoſed the four an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>North Welſh</hi> ſhires, formed by <hi>Edward</hi> I. immediately after the conqueſt of our principality. I cannot aſſign any derivation of the word: our county is totally deſtitute of the foſſil uſually ſo called. I can only remark, that it is purely <hi>Saxon;</hi> and, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is not mentioned in the Doomſday book, was called ſo before the Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>THIS place alſo ſeems to me to have been the ſame with what was named <hi>Colſul</hi> or <hi>Coleſhill.</hi> I can find no other ſite for the chapel of <hi>Colſul,</hi> granted by <hi>David ap Llewelyn</hi> to the abby of <hi>Baſingwerk.</hi> The preſent <hi>Flint</hi> probably went at this period under both names. There is no trace of any chapel in the neighborhood excepting this; nor any other place of conſequence enough to tempt our princes to live at. It was called in the Doomſday book <hi>Coleſelt;</hi> and was poſſeſſed by <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Rudland. Edwin</hi> held it from him, and as a free-man. Here was one hide of land taxable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0181900401:56"/>THE whole place appears to have been founded in times of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and every proviſion made againſt an attack from a people recently ſubdued, and who had ſubmitted reluctantly to a foreign yoke. The town is formed on the principle of a <hi>Roman</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campment, being rectangular, and ſurrounded with a vaſt ditch and two great ramparts, with the four regular <hi>portae,</hi> as uſual with that military nation. I ſhall hereafter give a conjecture of the probability of its having been a <hi>Roman</hi> ſtation.</p>
            <p>THE public buildings within this precinct are the church, the town-hall, and the jail; not one of which is any ornament to this little capital. The church, or rather chapel, is dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to St. <hi>Mary;</hi> and is only a perpetual curacy under <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thop.</hi> I imagine this to have been the <hi>capella de Colſul</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Dugdale Monaſt. I. 720.</note>, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the abby of <hi>Baſingwerk,</hi> mentioned in the charter of <hi>David ap Llewelyn;</hi> at leſt, I can trace no other. <hi>Flint,</hi> in that time, was probably comprehended under the name of <hi>Colſul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE caſtle ſtands on a low free-ſtone rock that juts into the ſands, a little north-eaſt of the town; and was once joined to it by a bridge which led to the outwork, called the <hi>Barbican;</hi> a ſquare tower, with a gateway, now entirely demoliſhed. Within was a court ſurrounded with a ditch faced with a wall, that joined by means of a drawbridge to the main fortreſs; whoſe entrance, for better ſecurity, was little more than a poſtern.</p>
            <p>THE caſtle is a ſquare building, with a large round tower at three of the corners, and a fourth a little disjoined from the other, and much larger than the reſt. This is called the <hi>double tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

It had been joined to the caſtle by a drawbridge, and is of great thickneſs. It has a circular gallery beneath, vaulted, with four arched openings into a central area, a little more than twenty-two feet in diameter. In one part, the gallery is ſuddenly low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, and goes ſloping towards the caſtle; and then riſing upwards, makes a ſort of communication with an upper gallery.</p>
            <p>THIS was the Keep, or ſtrong part of the caſtle, and the ſame that the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>le Dongeon;</hi> to which, as <hi>Froiſſart</hi> informs us, the unfortunate <hi>Richard</hi> II. retired, as the place of greateſt ſecurity, when he was taken by <hi>Bolingbroke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE channel of the <hi>Dee</hi> at preſent is at ſome diſtance from the walls; but formerly flowed beneath. There are ſtill in ſome parts rings, to which ſhips were moored.</p>
            <p>THE founder of this caſtle is uncertain. <hi>Cambden</hi> attributes it to <hi>Henry</hi> II. and his noble hiſstorian<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord <hi>Lyttelton.</hi>
               </note> is of the ſame opinion. After his eſcape at <hi>Euloe,</hi> it is poſſible that he might have begun a fortreſs here for ſecurity in future times; that he might have left it incomplete; and that it was finiſhed by <hi>Edward</hi> I. The rolls of the laſt reign mention the place ſeveral times.</p>
            <p>IN the year 1277, there was an order for proclaming a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket and fair to be held at <hi>Flint;</hi> and the ſame was afterwards done through <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and the cantreds of <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN 1280, appears an order for the cuſtody of the gate of the caſtle of <hi>Flint.</hi> Perhaps this might have been the year in which it was firſt garriſoned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0181900401:59"/>
IN 1283, the town received its firſt charter; was made a free borough; and the mayor ſworn faithfully to preſerve its liberties.

            <p>IN 1283, the burgeſſes alſo received a grant from <hi>Edward,</hi> of timber out of the woods of <hi>Northop, Ledebroke</hi> the greater and leſſer, <hi>Keldreſton, Wolſynton, Weper,</hi> and <hi>Sutton,</hi> in order to ſmelt their lead ore; and at the ſame time a right of paſturage in the ſame woods.</p>

            <p>THE firſt great event that occurs to me reſpecting this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs is in the year 1280, when the <hi>Welſh,</hi> wearied with the reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of oppreſſion, as a ſignal of general inſurrection, ſurprized the place<note n="†" place="bottom">76.</note>; at the ſame time that <hi>David,</hi> brother of <hi>Llewelyn;</hi> took <hi>Hawarden;</hi> and <hi>Rees</hi> the ſon of <hi>Malgon,</hi> and <hi>Griffith ap Meredeth ap Owen,</hi> ſeized the caſtle of <hi>Aberyſtwyth</hi>

            <p>FLINT fell afterwards into the hands of the loyaliſts; for, under the year 1646, I find in the ſame hiſtorian, that the garriſon ſeemed inclinable to come to a treaty.

            <p>THERE is a tradition, that in very old times there ſtood a large town at this place; and it is ſaid the foundations of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings have been frequently turned up by the plough.

            <p>In page 42 I mentioned my ſuſpicion, that the precinct of <hi>Flint</hi> town once ſerved to incloſe a ſmall <hi>Roman</hi> ſtation: I am confirmed in my opinion, from the multitudes of <hi>Roman</hi> coins, <hi>Fibulae,</hi> and variety of antique inſtruments, lately diſcovered by the workmen in the old waſhes of this and the next pariſh; which prove that the <hi>Romans</hi> made this their port for exporting the metal, after it was fuſed from the ore of the adjacent mountains. Here might be placed a ſmall garriſon to protect the antient ſmelters, or to collect the duties, or to receive the tribute of metal.

            <p>IN a ſmall time after the <hi>Romans</hi> had carried their arms through our iſland, they began to apply with vigor to the working of the mines.

Many of the works that we ſuſpect to have been <hi>Roman</hi> are very ſhallow; generally in form of trenches, through which they purſued the veins. They probably were diſcovered from ſlight cauſes.

            <p>PICK-AXES of an uncommon bulk, and very clumſy, have been diſcovered in the bottom of the mineral trenches.

            <p>IN many reſpects the antient methods of mining were ſimilar to thoſe in preſent uſe. The laborers worked by ſtems, relieving each other at ſtated times. They worked night and day, by the light of lamps. They drove levels, and ſunk ſhafts, propping up the ground as they went on. They purſued the veins by forming drifts<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>; and finally, whenever the mines were moleſted with water, they had pumps, which flung up the water from the greateſt depths they arrived at<note n="‡" place="bottom">Diodorus Siculus, <hi>lib.</hi> v. c. 2.</note>.</p>
            <p>I HAVE mentioned above,<note place="margin">DIVINING ROD</note> the caſual detection of our mineral wealth.

                  <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> lib. v. c. 2. gives a melancholy account of theſe ſlaves; whoſe ſtate can only be paralleled by the poor <hi>Indians</hi> in the mines of <hi>Potoſt.</hi>
               </note>, and <hi>Britons</hi> newly ſubjugated. It is probable, that when the iſland was entirely ſettled, this badge of ſlavery was taken away, and the miners were, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the arrival of the <hi>Romans,</hi> voluntary laborers.</p>
            <p>WHEN the ore was got, it was cleanſed according to the modern method, and ſmelted in a furnace<note n="‡" place="bottom">Plinii, <hi>lib.</hi> xxxiv. c. 16.</note>, and caſt into forms very nearly reſembling the common pigs of lead.</p>
            <p>OF ſuch,<note place="margin">ROMAN PIGS OF LEAD</note> I have ſeen three, found in different parts of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: the one in <hi>Hints,</hi> common, in the manor of <hi>Ralph Floyer</hi> eſquire, in the county of Stafford, in the year 1771. It was found under ground, at the depth of four feet. Its length
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0181900401:71"/>
is twenty-two inches and a half; the weight a hundred and fifty-two pounds, about two pounds heavier than our common pigs of lead. On the upper ſurface is a rim; within that, in raiſed capitals, ſtruck when the metal was hot, is this inſcription: IMP.x.VESP<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>
               <abbr>VII</abbr>xTxIMPx<abbr>V</abbr>xCOS. or <hi>Imperatore</hi> VES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PASIANO <hi>Septimùm</hi> TITO <hi>Imperatore quintùm Conſule:</hi> which anſwers to the year 75 or 76.</p>
            <p>ON one ſide is the word DECEA, and at a diſtance the letter G. An ingenious Anonymous, in the Gentleman's <hi>Magazine</hi> of 1772, conjectures it to have been a C, made by the ſuperintendant of the mine, or furnace, to ſhew either that the pig had paid duty, or was of due weight, or of proper purity. For my part, I am of opinion, that DECEA had once between it and the G, the letter N; which will render it DECEANG, or <hi>de Ceangis,</hi> the place which produced the ore; but by ſome accident that letter was defaced, and the G left ſeemingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected. This explanation will fling light on certain pieces of lead deſcribed by <hi>Cambden,</hi> to be taken notice of a few lines lower.</p>
            <p>THIS curious antiquity is in the cabinet of Mr. <hi>Green,</hi> apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary in <hi>Litchfield;</hi> whoſe collection merits the attention of the inquiſitive traveller; who may be aſſured of the moſt liberal reception from the worthy owner.</p>
            <p>IN 1731, two pigs of the ſame kind, and of the ſame length, were diſcovered on <hi>Hayſhaw</hi> moor, in the manor of <hi>Dacre,</hi> in the weſt riding of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> on the eſtate of Sir <hi>John Ingleby</hi> of <hi>Ripley.</hi> One is preſerved by the family: the other was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the <hi>Britiſh Muſeum.</hi> Theſe alſo have an imperial inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>IN the time of <hi>Cambden,</hi> twenty pieces of lead, ſimilar to the above, were found near <hi>Halton</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire;</hi> ſome inſcribed, IMP. DOMIT. AUG. C. DE CEANG.; others, IMP. VESP. VII. T. IMP. V. COSS. Theſe have been ſuppoſed to commemorate a victory over the <hi>Cangi;</hi> but it is evident that they were nothing more than pigs of lead brought here for uſe, or for tranſportation: and I am farther ſatisfied, that the ore which produced this lead was dug and ſmelted, either in that part of <hi>Flintſhire</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently called <hi>Tegangle,</hi> or the ſummer's reſidence of the <hi>Cangi,</hi> or <hi>Ceangi;</hi> or from the reſidence of the ſame order of people either in <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> or ſome neighboring county. This gives reaſon to ſuſpect, that theſe <hi>Cangi,</hi> during their long vacant time, might ſometimes engage in mineral concerns; and then the ore, when ſmelted, might receive the mark of the people from whom it was received. The pig of lead in Mr. <hi>Green</hi>'s cabinet, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came from the <hi>Cangi</hi> of <hi>Derbyſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM the regulation mentioned by <hi>Pliny,</hi> and all theſe impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial inſcriptions, it is clear, that the public took the mineral concerns into its own hands; and had their ſtamp-maſters in proper places. I cannot pretend to fix the period of the firſt eſtabliſhment. If the inſcription to <hi>Claudius</hi>

            <p>THE <hi>Romans</hi> found ſuch plenty of ſilver in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> mines, that for ſome time they never thought it worth their labor to extract it from lead<note n="*" place="bottom">Strabo, <hi>lib.</hi> iii. p. 221.</note>. In later times, they diſcovered an ore that contained ſilver, tin, and lead; and theſe three metals were ſmelted from it. It appears, that the firſt product was the tin; the ſecond, the ſilver; and what <hi>Pliny</hi> calls <hi>Galaena,</hi> which was left behind in the furnace, and ſeems to be the ſame with our <hi>litharge,</hi> and being melted again, became lead, or, as the antients called it (to diſtinguiſh it from white lead or tin) <hi>black lead</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Plinii, <hi>lib.</hi> xxxiv. c. 16.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Britiſh</hi> name of lead is loſt. The only word we have to expreſs an ore is <hi>mwyn;</hi> but the ſpecies is expreſſed by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct, as <hi>mwyn aur,</hi> gold, <hi>mwyn plwm,</hi> lead ore; both which were probably derived from the <hi>Latin.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> made uſe of the word <hi>metallum</hi> to expreſs ore, as well as the metal fuſed from it: the word <hi>minera</hi> is a word of a barbarous age, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably derived from our <hi>mwyn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I SHALL finiſh this account of the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtate of the lead concerns, with obſerving, that they appeared to have been well verſed in metallurgy, and to have had their ſmelting-houſes. The ruder <hi>Britons,</hi> before their conqueſt by the <hi>Romans,</hi> had a very ſimple proceſs. They placed the ore in a hole in the ground, and mixed it with wood; which being fired, proved
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0181900401:74"/>
sufficient to melt the lead out of the ſoft and kindly ores of this country; a ſmall gutter communicated with a ſecond hole, into which the metal ran from the firſt. Theſe artleſs ſlag-hearths are very frequent in our county, diſcovered by the quantity of <hi>ſcoria</hi> mixed with charcoal. Some of our modern ſmelters have endeavoured to extract the remaining part of the metal from theſe ſlags, but in vain; the antient ſmelters having ſo effectually done their buſineſs, as not to have left behind ſufficient to pay the expences of a ſecond operation: the moſt that could be procured from a ton of ſlags, amounting only to about a hundred and fifty pounds weight.</p>
            <p>I CANNOT tell what uſe the <hi>Britons</hi> made of the metal, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as an article of commerce. I muſt not dare to aſſent to the tale of the venerable <hi>Bede</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. i. c. 2. p. 42.</note>, who ſays, that the ſtakes driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Thames,</hi> to obſtruct the paſſage of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> were wrapped round with lead. The project was uſeleſs, This expedient of the <hi>Britons</hi> was temporary; the ſtakes did not require ſuch a covering to preſerve them; and the metal of lead was ſurely very improper to point them with.</p>
            <p>I am of opinion, that there had been in our country a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of founderies of lead, from the time of the <hi>Romans</hi> to the preſent, at every period in which the civil commotions would permit them to be carried on. The <hi>Saxons</hi> worked the <hi>Britiſh</hi> mines as well as the <hi>Romans,</hi> and made frequent uſe of the lead in all works of eccleſiaſtial magnificence.

We are aſſured that there have been, at different times, ſmelting-works for a century or two paſt in the pariſhes of <hi>Flint</hi> and <hi>Hawarden;</hi> and at preſent there is one in uſe in each of them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall take this opportunity of mentioning incidentally the other minerals of <hi>Greet Britain,</hi> taken notice of by the antients, either as articles of trade or matters of curioſity.</p>
            <p>TIN was aot only the firſt metal in theſe iſlands which we read of;<note place="margin">TIN</note> but alſo the greateſt object of commerce; and which originally led to the diſcovery of <hi>Great Britain</hi> by the <hi>Romans.</hi> The mercantile <hi>Phoenicians</hi> traded to the <hi>Silley</hi> iſlands, the <hi>Caſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terides,</hi> or land of tin, from the port of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> four hundred years before CHRIST. The <hi>Romans,</hi> for a conſiderable ſpace, could not diſcover the place from whence the former procured the precious, metal. They attempted to detect the trade, by following the courſe of a <hi>Phoenician</hi> veſſel; but the maſter, faithful to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of his country, voluntarily run his ſhip aſhore in another, place; preferring the loſs of all, rather than ſuffer a foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to become partakers of ſo profitable a ſecret. The public immediately compenſated his loſs out of its treaſury. This did
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0181900401:76"/>
but make the <hi>Romans</hi> more eager after the diſcovery; and after many trials, ſucceeded. <hi>Publius Craſſus</hi> (father of <hi>Marcus Craſſus</hi> the <hi>Triumvir)</hi> who was praetor, and governed <hi>Spain</hi> for ſeveral years, landed in the <hi>Caſſiterides,</hi> and found the report of their riches verified<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Strabo,</hi> lib. iii. p. 265. to 309</note>.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Romans</hi> made a conqueſt of the country, they formed in the tin province camps and roads, ſtill viſible; and left behind vaſes, urns, ſepulchres, and money, that exhibit daily proofs of their having been a ſtationary people in thoſe parts<note n="†" place="bottom">Borlaſe, Antiq.

            </p>
            <p>IT is not to be imagined, that they could neglect a corner of our iſland, productive of a metal ſo uſeful in mechanics as tin, and which it yielded in ſuch plenty, as to receive from that circumſtance the name. So great was the intercourſe that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nations had with the inhabitants bordering on <hi>Belerium,</hi> as to give them a greater <hi>ſçavoir vivre,</hi> and more extenſive hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, than was to be found in other parts of the iſland. They were equally expert in working the mines, and preparing the ore, which lay in earthy veins within the rocky ſtrata. They melted and purified it, then caſt it into rows of cubes, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it to <hi>Ictis,</hi> the modern Iſle of <hi>Wight:</hi> from thence it was tranſported into <hi>Gaul;</hi> conveyed from the place, it was landed at, on horſes backs, a journey of thirty days, to the mouth
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0181900401:77"/>

            <p>DID not <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> agree in their account,<note place="margin">COPPER</note> I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have believed it was poſſible that the <hi>Britons</hi> could have neglected their rich mines of copper, and have been obliged at firſt to have imported that metal.

            <p>N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1. tab. viii. is a rich ornament of gold, in form of a but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton with a ſhank.

This ſeems to have belonged to the bracelet or necklace (it is uncertain which), whoſe fragment is repreſented at N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2. This is alſo compoſed of gold links, with round beads of a rich blue glaſs placed between every ſecond link. Something ſimilar to this is preſerved by count <hi>Caylus,</hi> which is entire, and appears to have been a necklace<note n="†" place="bottom">Tom. iii. 312.</note>.</p>

With it was found a thick piece of ſea-green glaſs, part of a vaſe. Glaſs was among the earlier imports into <hi>Britain</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Strabo, 305.</note>, when the wild natives were as much cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated with toys as the <hi>Indians</hi> of new-diſcovered countries are at preſent. At firſt they received theſe, and all their other vitreous commodities, by means of the <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> whoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, <hi>Tyre,</hi> was pre-eminent in that manufacture. The <hi>glain nadroedd,</hi> or ſnake-gems, were at firſt obtained by way of exchange for the <hi>Britiſh</hi> exports. They were originally made by the <hi>Britons</hi> of ſtone. I have ſuch a one in my cabinet.

            <p>N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 4. is a ſmall brazen head, with the back part affixed to iron.

The pen, if I may call it ſo, was uſually of braſs; one end pointed, in order to write; the other flatted, in order to efface what was wrong, by ſmoothing or cloſing the wax. <hi>Horace</hi> gives every writer moſt excellent advice, in alluding to this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice:</p>

            <p>N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 15. 15. ſeem to have been inſtruments of ſacrifice. One end of each is round, and of the form of an olive; and was intended for the uſe of the <hi>aruſpices,</hi> to inſinuate under the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails of the victim, and to lift them up for the better inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts.

            <p>ACCORDING to the uncertainty that reigns reſpecting the uſes of the antient inſtruments, I may hazard another conjecture, that they have been chirurgical inſtruments. The rounded ends were the probes; the hollow end of the longer, the ſpoon by which the balm was poured into the wound.

Some of them are confined to particular counties, others to the kingdom in general: and the only prohibition is that of working beneath caſtles or houſes; in gardens or meadows; the owners of which were to be indemnified in all damages they might ſuſtain. <hi>Richard</hi> II. is the firſt prince who makes a general allowance.

            <p>THIS is not the firſt inſtance of the application of the tithe of ore to religious uſes: <hi>Edward</hi> I. directs the ſame proportion to be payed to the parochial churches in <hi>Wales,</hi> out of the neighboring mines<note n="*" place="bottom">Rotull Wallia (<hi>Sir</hi> Joſeph Ayloff's) 75.</note>.

            <p>I CANNOT find that the owner of the ground, in caſe the mine was diſcovered in private property, was permitted to have any ſhare of the profit, till the fifth of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. (1426); when the duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> regent of <hi>France,</hi> received a ten years leafe of all the mines of gold and ſilver in the kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> paying to Holy Church a tenth, to the king a fifteenth, and to the lord of the ſoil the twentieth part. This allotment, though finall, is a proof of the juſtice and moderation that guided the actions of the protector of <hi>Henry</hi>'s infant years.</p>
            <p>THESE regal grants were for every ſpecies of metal, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iron; for gold and ſilver, copper, tin and lead, and all other metals containing gold and ſilver. Theſe two were the great object; yet the grants do not preclude the royal clame to the baſer kinds.</p>
            <p>DURING this reign, the art of refining, or the ſeparation of metals from the ore, was made the ground of an impoſture

common enough in after times. There are not fewer than four inſtances of perſons undertaking the tranſmutation of the baſer metals into pure gold and ſilver; each of whom received the royal protection<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rymer's Foedera,</hi> xi 68. 128. 240. 309. <hi>Henry</hi> IV. had paſſed an act, that <q>none ſhall uſe to multiply gold or ſilver, nor uſe the craft of multiplication; and if any the ſame do, that he incur penalty of felony.</q> This was aimed at perſons, who, under pretence of tranſmutation, counterfeited the nobler metals. But afterwards it was found a check on the metallurgic art; as it extended even to the puniſhment of any ingenious refiner, who had diſcovered the method of getting more gold and ſilver out of the baſer kinds than was known before, which occaſioned the repeal of the act, in the firſt year of <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> c. 30.</note>, to prevent them from being interrupted in their operations: for certain malevolent people ſuppoſed they uſed unlawful arts, <hi>i. e.</hi> the art magic.

            <p>IN the ſhort and turbulent reign of <hi>Richard</hi> III. no attention was paid to concerns of this kind; but his ſucceſſor, <hi>Henry</hi> VII. in his very firſt year, diſcovered his ruling paſſion, avarice, by immediately appointing <hi>Jaſper</hi> duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and ſeveral other perſons of diſtinction, to be governors of all his mines in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Wales,</hi> paying to the king the fifteenth<note n="‡" place="bottom">

            <p>ELIZABETH was the firſt of our princes who laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our mineral ſucceſs, and for all the vaſt manufactures
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0181900401:95"/>
that aroſe in conſequence. I read, that in 1452, <hi>Henry</hi> VI.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer, xi. 317.</note>, (poſſibly on diſcovery of the impoſture of metallic tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) had ſent for, out of <hi>Hungary, Auſtria,</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> three experienced miners, and thirty aſſiſtants, to work his mines; ſo unſkilled were the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at that time. The civil wars, which broke out immediately after, fruſtrated this wiſe meaſure. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> reſumed it, being too quick-ſighted not to ſee into the defects and wants of her kingdom. She not only adopted it, but improved on the plan. Our knowlege of minerals was almoſt extinguiſhed, and of courſe the manufactures which depended on them. We imported our ſwords, our knives, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups, bits, and even our pins, out of <hi>Germany,</hi> through the channel of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> Our works of braſs, and even our wire, excepting a ſmall quantity which was worked by hand, were of foreign fabrick. The firſt ſtep taken by this politic princeſs, was to forbid the importation of theſe and ſeveral other articles, from parts beyond ſea<note n="†" place="bottom">Statute 5th <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> c. 7.</note>: the next, was to invite into her kingdom foreign miners, foreign ſmelters, and foreign arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of metallic productions.</p>
            <p>SHE next formed a corporation, under the title of THE SOCIETY FOR THE MINES ROYAL. The firſt governor was <hi>William</hi> earl of <hi>Pembroke:</hi> ſeveral men of rank were joined in the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as aſſiſtants, and ſeveral citizens, and ſome foreigners of known experience in theſe matters. She likewiſe framed the ſame members into another corporation, which naturally depended on the former, <hi>viz.</hi> the SOCIETY FOR THE MINERALS AND BATTERY WORKS. Theſe corporations were founded on <hi>May</hi> the 28th 1567.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0181900401:96"/>SOME progreſs had been made, a few years before, for the procuring materials for theſe new manufactures; for in 1563, ſhe had granted the mines of eight counties, beſides thoſe in <hi>Wales,</hi> to <hi>Daniel Houghſetter:</hi> in 1564, ſhe made another grant to <hi>Cornelius Devoſſe;</hi> and a third in the ſame year, more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive than all, to <hi>Chriſtopher Shutz,</hi> of all mines, minerals, and ſubterraneous treaſures, (except copperas and allum) which ſhall be found in all other parts of <hi>England</hi> (not mentioned in the former patent) or within the <hi>Engliſh</hi> pale in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the name of gold, ſilver, copper, tin, lead, quickſilver, <hi>cadmian</hi> ore, or <hi>lapis calaminaris;</hi> and all manner of ewres or oares, ſimple or pure, mixt or compounded for latten wire or ſteel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To each of theſe patentees an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> was joined.</p>
            <p>IT is worth obſerving, that the crown, in moſt of theſe grants, lays abſolute clame to all mines whatſoever, under a notion that they are royal mines; yet the prerogative could only be entitled to ſuch which yielded gold and ſilver. The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of this pretence aroſe from the king's right of coinage, in order that he might have the requiſite materials; which would have confined him to the two noble metals. But until the happy period arrived when our conſtitution was eſtabliſhed, and the royal and the private property juſtly diſtinguiſhed, the ſubject was too weak to aſſert his rightful clame. ELIZABETH herſelf was too fond of the darling prerogative (even with all her boaſted love to her people) to reſign this part. Her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to <hi>William Humfrey</hi> and <hi>Chriſtopher Shutz</hi> is worded in the moſt unlimited manner; for it not only gave them power to ſink ſhafts whereſoever they pleaſed (gardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> excepted),
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0181900401:97"/>
but to build houſes requiſite to carry on the works, not only upon the royal demeſnes, but in the grounds of any of her ſubjects. The ſpirited <hi>Percies,</hi> in the perſon of <hi>Thomas</hi> earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> firſt withſtood this invaſion of his right. He conteſted with the crown the title to the copper mines in his manor of <hi>Keſwick;</hi> but the lawyers decided againſt him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging, that although the crown had a power to grant away its manors, it had not the power to alienate the mineral, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly linked to the prerogative of the crown.</p>
            <p>BUT, as uſual, the gentlemen of the long robe had two opinions reſpecting this point: ſome aſſerting, that if any gold or ſilver was found in the mines of baſer metal, the whole would belong to the king; which, in fact, was beſtowing all the mineral property on the crown, there being ſcarcely any baſe metal but what holds ſome particles of the nobler: others again, in a future reign, qualified this by ſaying, <q>That although the gold or ſilver contained in the baſe metal of a mine, in the hands of a ſubject, be of leſs value than the baſe metal, yet if the gold or ſilver do countervail the charge of reſining it, or be of more worth than the baſe metal ſpent in reſining it, THIS IS A ROYAL MINE; and as well the baſe metal as the gold and ſilver in it, belong to the prerogative of the crown<note n="*" place="bottom">This opinion was given in 1640, 1641, and ſubſcribed by <hi>Maynard, Glaw ville,</hi> and others, the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>SUCH was the ſtate of the royal clame; ſo diſcouraging to the induſtry of the ſubject, till the great event of the REVO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUTION,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0181900401:98"/>
when the crown, in the firſt year of <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> fully gave up all pretenſions to the mines of copper, tin, iron, and lead, notwithſtanding gold or ſilver may be extracted from them in any quantities. By a following act, this right was again confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; only the crown reſerved to itſelf a power of purchaſing, within thirty days after raiſing, all ores made merchantable, at the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing rates: copper at 16 <hi>l. per</hi> ton, tin at 40 <hi>l.</hi> lead at 9 l.; and in default of ſuch payment, the owners were at liberty to diſpoſe of their ore as they pleaſed. Thus, as Mr. BLACKSTON<note n="*" place="bottom">COMMENTARIES, 4 to, i. 294.</note> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, the private owners were not diſcouraged from working mines, through a fear that they may be clamed as royal; neither does the king depart from the juſt rights of his revenue, ſince he may have all the precious metal contained in the ore, paying no more for it than the value of the baſe metal is ſuppoſed to be; to which baſe metal the land-owner is by reaſon and law entitled.</p>
            <p>SOME account of the ores and foſſils of the mineral tract, which gave riſe to this digreſſion, will be given when I croſs it again in the courſe of my journey.</p>
            <p>FROM <hi>Pentre Halkin,</hi> I purſued my journey along the <hi>Cheſter</hi> road: and paſs by the <hi>Llan.</hi> The church is dedicated to St. <hi>Mary;</hi> is a neat ſmall edifice, lately re-built, partly by a brief, partly by ſubſcription. It ſtood on the ſite of a church, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Doomſday book.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0181900401:99"/>
called <hi>Inglecroft,</hi> at that time were joined to it. Doomſday book ſays, that here was a church and a preſbyter, and three boors; a mill of five ſhillings annual value; and a wood half a league long, and forty perches broad; the whole valued at ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
            <p>THE old <hi>Britiſh</hi> name of this place (ſtill retained by the <hi>Welſh</hi>) is <hi>Lugan,</hi> from a ſaint, known, I believe, only in the <hi>Welſh</hi> calendar.</p>
            <p>ABOUT two or three miles farther, in a woody moraſs on the left hand, are the foundations of an antient pile, called <hi>Llýs Edwin,</hi> or Llýs Llan <hi>Eurgain,</hi> originally the ſeat of <hi>Edwin ap Gronw,</hi> lord of <hi>Tegangle,</hi> about the year 1041.

            <p>I MUST not paſs unnoticed a ſtrong <hi>Britiſh</hi> poſt, which ſoars above the road,<note place="margin">MOEL Y GAER.</note> about two miles to the right. It lies on the ſummit of a hill, and is ſurrounded with a great foſs and dike
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0181900401:100"/>
of a circular form, with an entrance as uſual to ſuch places; and a ſmall artificial mount within the precinct; a <hi>tribunal ceſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titium,</hi> from whence our antient heroes might deliver their <hi>araith</hi> or <hi>allocutio,</hi> to animate their followers againſt the invading ſtrangers. This poſt is called <hi>Moel y Gaer,</hi> or the hill of the fortreſs; a name common to ſeveral others of ſimilar uſe. This ſeems to have been an out poſt of the <hi>Ordovices,</hi> in order to defend their country againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> invaders. We ſhall, towards the end of the volume, have occaſion to mention the chain of poſts along the <hi>Clwydian</hi> hills, from that next to the ſea, to remote and internal parts. Our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtry diſputed the poſſeſſion of their country by inches. Here they lodged their wives and children; to theſe places they drove their cattle out of the low country: they eſtabliſhed in each numerous garriſons ready to ſally forth and repel the foe; or to defend all that was dear to them, ſhould the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders be hardy enough to attack them in their intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>IN later times, this ſpot proved fatal to a valiant partizan of <hi>Owen Glendwr. Howel Gwynedd</hi> (whom we lately mentioned) was ſurprized in a negligent hour, within this poſt, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.</p>

            <p>IT appears by theſe proceedings, as if the parlement was fearful of the conſequences of even an act of juſtice; for, during the long troubles, there had been ſuch vaſt change of property, effected by fuch variety of means, that it was apprehended, that the enquiry into the cauſes, and the diſpoſſeſſion of numbers who had quietly enjoyed ſuch property from their fathers, might be attended with the moſt inflammatory conſequences. It is likewiſe probable, that many of the members might be intereſted in the event; therefore, were determined to ſtop at once any proceeding that might tend to affect the fortunes of themſelves or friends. Numbers of ſales were made by the loyaliſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, under the influence of fear. They were content to receive a trifle for the purchaſe, rather than loſe the whole by violence; for there were very few who had not incurred a premunire under the ruling powers; which they were glad to get clear of by a ſeemingly voluntary ſale. When they were thus diſappointed in the hope of re-enjoyment of their fortunes, they laid the blame on the king, and invented the calumny of his rejecting this bill, after it had been paſſed unanimouſly by both houſes.</p>
            <p>DURING the civil wars, this cattle ſuffered the uſual viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of fortune.

and a few walls, and the foundations of ſome rooms, exiſt at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; which Sir <hi>John Glynne</hi> has, with great pains, laid open by the removal of the rubbiſh. In one place was diſcovered a long flight of ſteps, at the bottom of which was a door, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a draw-bridge, which croſſed a deep long chaſm (nicely faced with freeſtone) to another door leading to two or three ſmall rooms. Probably they were places of confinement, where pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners might be lodged with the utmoſt ſecurity, after pulling up the bridge over the deep chaſm that intervened between them and open day.</p>
            <p>THE ſeveral parts of this fortreſs ſeem to have been built at different times. It is ſurrounded with deep foſſes, now filled with trees. In 1665, the timber of the park and demeſne was valued at five thouſand pounds, and was ſold in that century; but the preſent owner will have the merit of reſtoring it many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold to the next, by the vaſt plantations he has made.</p>

He was, next to <hi>Pym,</hi> the moſt active manager againſt the earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi> The unfortunate peer remarked, that <hi>Glynne</hi> and <hi>Maynard</hi> treated him like advocates; <hi>Palmer</hi> and <hi>Whitelock</hi> like gentlemen; and yet omitted nothing material that could be urged againſt him<note n="*" place="bottom">Whitelock, 49</note>.

He was grateful to his patron; for, being appointed of the committee to receive the protector's ſcruples about being made king, he urged the acceptance with the utmoſt zeal. It is amuſing to compare the change of ſentiment, from the year 1648, when the kingly office was voted to be unneceſſary, burthenſome, and dangerous, with the opinion of 1657, when the learned ſerjeant tells <hi>Cromwel,</hi> that it is eſſential to the ſettlement of the nation<note n="†" place="bottom">Parliament Hiſt. xxi. 90.</note>. Notwithſtanding the uſurper did not dare to aſſume the name, he mimicked the powers; and honored his advocate with calling him up by writ into his houſe of peers; that motley aſſembly of the year 1657. The prudent lawyer maintained his ground till the year of the reſtoration, when, by a maſter-piece of cunning, he publiſhed in octavo, the arguments he had uſed to prevale with his former maſter to mount the throne, under the title of MONARCHY <hi>aſſerted to be the beſt, the moſt antient, and</hi>

            <p>WHETHER this recommended him to the new government, or whether he had made his peace before, is not certain. He was received by <hi>Charles</hi> with diſtinguiſhed marks of favor, who not only knighted him, but beſtowed on him the honor of prime ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, and even created his eldeſt ſon a baronet.

               <p>THE gate in queſtion faced the great <hi>Watling ſtreet road,</hi> and near the place where other military ways united. Through this was the greateſt conflux of people; which rendered the uſe of the double portal more requiſite.</p>

                  <note place="margin">HYPOCY</note> in <hi>Bridge ſtreet,</hi> is probably ſtill entire; but the only part which can be ſeen, by reaſon of the more modern ſuperſtructures, is the <hi>Hypocauſt.</hi> This is of a rectangular figure, ſupported by thirty-two pillars, two feet ten inches and a half high, and about eighteen inches diſtant from each other. Upon each is a tile eighteen inches
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0181900401:133"/>
ſquare, as if deſigned for a capital; and over them a perforated tile two feet ſquare. Such are continued over all the pillars. Above theſe are two layers; one of coarſe mortar, mixed with ſmall red gravel, about three inches thick; and the other of finer materials, between four and five inches thick: theſe ſeem to have been the floor of the room above. The pillars ſtand on a mortar-floor, ſpread over the rock. On the ſouth ſide, between the middle pillars, is the vent for the ſmoke, about ſix inches ſquare, which is at preſent open to the height of ſixteen inches. Here is alſo an anti-chamber, exactly of the ſame extent with the <hi>Hypocauſt,</hi> with an opening in the middle into it. This is ſunk near two feet below the level of the former, and is of the ſame rectangular figure; ſo that both together are an exact ſquare. This was the room allotted for the ſlaves who attended to heat the place; the other was the receptacle of the fuel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to heat the room above, the <hi>concamerata ſudatio</hi>

Such was the object of this Hypocauſt; for there were others of different forms, for the purpoſes of heating the waters deſtined for the uſe of the bathers.</p>
               <p>I MUST now deſcend towards the bridge, in ſearch of the few further reliques of the antient coloniſts. After paſſing through the gate, on the right, near ſome ſkinners houſes, is a ſmall flight of ſteps, which lead to a large round arch, ſeemingly of <hi>Roman</hi> workmanſhip. It is now filled with more modern ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonry,

and a paſſage left through a ſmall arch of a very eccentric form.<note place="margin">ANTIENT POS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERN.</note> On the left, within the very paſſage, is the appearance of another round arch, now filled up.

               </p>
               <p>THIS ſeems originally deſigned for the common paſſage over the <hi>Dee,</hi> into the country of the <hi>Ordovices,</hi> either by means of a boat at high-water, or by fording at low, the river here being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably ſhallow. What reduces this to a certainty is, that the rock on the <hi>Hanbridge</hi> ſide is cut down, as if for the conveniency of travellers.

               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Lupus</hi> was firmly eſtabliſhed, he began to exert his regal prerogatives.

They were obliged to pay him attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and to repair to his court to give it the greater dignity. They were bound, in time of war with <hi>Wales,</hi> to find for every knight's-fee a horſe with capariſon and furniture, or two with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out furniture, in the diviſion of <hi>Cheſhire.</hi> Their knights and freeholders were to have corſelets and habergeons, and were to defend their lands with their own bodies. Every baron had alſo four eſquires; every eſquire one gentleman; and every gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman one valet<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>THE earls had their chamberlain, which ſupplied the place of chancellor; an office continued to this day. The firſt we
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0181900401:147"/>
know of was <hi>Philippus Camerarius,</hi> who took his name from his office, in the time of <hi>Randle Gernouns</hi> earl of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> Here is a baron of the exchequer, and other officers conformable to thoſe of the crown at <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> alſo juſtices, before whom the cauſes which of their nature ſhould otherwiſe belong reſpectively to the courts of king's-bench and common-pleas, are triable<note n="*" place="bottom">Leiceſter, 152.</note>.</p>
               <p>IN imitation of regal power, the earls appointed a high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> correſpondent to the high conſtable of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> which was held in fee by the baron of <hi>Halton,</hi> who by virtue of this office took place of the other barons; and the baron of <hi>Montalt</hi> had precedency (after him) by virtue of his office in fee, of high ſteward.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DE ROTHELENT was another baron, who was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief of the forces in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and prime governor of the county under his couſin <hi>Hugh Lupus.</hi> As his office and rank dropt with him, he is not reckoned among the barons. Probably the office was found unneceſſary, and claſhing with the priveleges of the high conſtable.</p>
               <p>THIS ſpecies of government continued from the Conqueſt till the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> III. a period of about 174 years; when, in 1237, on the death of <hi>John Scot</hi> (the ſeventh earl of the <hi>Norman</hi> line) without iſſue male, <hi>Henry</hi> took the earldom into his own hands, and gave the daughters of the late earl other lands in lieu; unwilling, as we ſaid, that ſo great an inheritance ſhould <hi>be parcelled out among diſtaffs.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>AFTER the reſumption of the earldom by the crown, the government of the city aſſumed a new form; for in the year 1242, the 26th of <hi>Henry</hi> III. it appears to have firſt been under the directions of a mayor and ſheriffs. The mayor ſeems to have been the ſubſtitute for the conſtable; an office which, during the period of the <hi>Norman</hi> earls, was, under them, ſupreme in all matters military and civil, in both city and county. The ſheriffs ſeem to have been a new name for bailiffs, who acted under the former<note n="*" place="bottom">Vale royal, 161.</note>.</p>
               <p>AFTER giving a general idea of the ſtate of this place and county to the time of <hi>Henry</hi> III. I ſhall return to the time of <hi>Hugh Lupus,</hi> and give, to the beſt of my power, a brief chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical account of its hiſtory; leaving the eccleſiaſtical part to be treated apart.</p>
               <p>IN the days of that potent earl, and probably long before he was poſſeſſed of this city, it enjoyed by preſcription divers priveleges.<note place="margin">GUILD MIRCA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TORY.</note> It had a <hi>guild mercatory</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 157.</note>, analogous to a modern corporation; ſo that no perſon who was not of that ſociety could exerciſe any trade or carry on any commerce within its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct. Such was the ſtate in which the <hi>Normans</hi> found it; which the earls afterwards confirmed under their ſeals.</p>
               <p>Two overſeers, ſelected out of the moſt reſpectable citizens, were appointed to maintain the rights of this <hi>guild.</hi> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0181900401:149"/>
for the uſe of the city, all the cuſtoms paid by ſtrangers, unleſs at the fairs, which in thoſe days were ſaid to have been held three times in the year. Theſe officers were probably of the ſame nature as the deans of <hi>guild</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi> It appears alſo from the Doomſday book, that here was a ſupreme officer, called the <hi>Prapeſitus Regis,</hi> or provoſt, who had the care both of the civil and commercial intereſts.</p>
               <p>IT is difficult to ſay at this time what were the articles of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, excepting ſlaves and horſes.<note place="margin">EXPORTS.

This was the mart for ſlaves, collected from all parts of <hi>England;</hi> and particularly young women, whom they took care to provide with a pregnancy, in order to enhance their value. It was a moſt moving ſight to ſee, in the public markets, rows of young people of both ſexes tied together with ropes; of great beauty, and in the flower of their youth, daily proſſituted, daily ſold.

                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0181900401:152"/>IT appears, that in the time of the <hi>Saxon</hi> monarch here were four hundred and thirty-one houſes which were taxable, beſides fifty-ſix that belonged to the biſhop: that it yielded ten marks of ſilver and a half; two parts to the king, and the third to the earl: that whenever the king came in perſon, he clamed from every plough-land two hundred <hi>heſthas,</hi> one <hi>cuna</hi> of ale, and one <hi>ruſca</hi> of butter<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>IT is probable that the city ſoon emerged from its calamities, and felt a conſiderable increaſe under its new maſters, a more poliſhed race; for the <hi>Normans</hi> affected as much elegance in their dreſs and their buildings, as they did temperance in their meat and drink.

The city did not confine its munificence to crowned heads; I find, that in 1583, <hi>Robert</hi> earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> chamberlain of the county palatine, met with a moſt honorable reception; was received at the high-croſs by the whole cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, entertained by the mayor, and preſented with a cup containing forty angels.

               </p>
               <p>FROM 1617, I diſcover nothing very particular for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſpace; till the city was involved in the calamities of a ſiege in 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>45-6, in conſequence of its unſhaken loyalty to <hi>Charles</hi> I. At the beginning of the civil war, immediate attention was paid to this important city, by the royal party. The fortifications were put into the beſt repair, and outworks extended from the alcove on the north part of the walls, to the brink of the river near <hi>Boughton;</hi> and in conſequence, numbers of houſes were pulled down, to prevent them from giving ſhelter to the enemy. The firſt attempt made on the place by the parlement army was
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0181900401:170"/>
on the 20th of <hi>July</hi> 1643, when Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> gave a violent aſſault on the works; but met with a repulſe. In the ſame year he ſent a ſummons to Sir <hi>Abraham Shipman,</hi> then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, to ſurrender: the gallant commander bid him come and win it and wear it.</p>
               <p>AFTER the repulſe of Lord <hi>Biron</hi> before <hi>Namptwich,</hi> the county of <hi>Cheſter</hi> was almoſt entirely in the hands of Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Brereton,</hi> and the city ſuffered from that time a ſort of blockade, from the quarters the enemy poſſeſſed in the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, even as near as the village of <hi>Chriſtleton.</hi> Sallies and excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were frequently made; and, according to the diary of the ſiege with advantage to the loyaliſts.</p>
               <p>ON <hi>September</hi> the 19th 1645, the parlement gained an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage irrecoverable by the beſieged. Colonel <hi>Jones</hi> and adjutant-general <hi>Lothian,</hi> who were employed in the reduction of <hi>Beeſton</hi> caſtle, drew from before that place, in a ſecret manner, a large body of forces, and in the night ſtormed the outworks, and made themſelves maſters of every thing, even to the city walls. His majeſty, immediately after this misfortune, paſſed through <hi>Wales,</hi> and got into the city, in hopes of animating the garriſon, and was lodged at Sir <hi>Francis Gamul</hi>'s, near the bridge. He ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived only time enough to be a ſpectator, from the leads of the <hi>Phoenix</hi> tower, of the fatal battle on <hi>Rowton</hi> heath, on <hi>September</hi> 24; when his forces, under Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> then on their march to raiſe the ſiege, after a well-diſputed action, ſunk under the ſuperior fortune of general <hi>Pointz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE king continued that night in <hi>Cheſter;</hi> and on quitting it the next day, gave orders to the governor, lord <hi>Biron,</hi> that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0181900401:171"/>
in caſe there was no appearance of relief within eight days, he was to treat of a ſurrender. The king took the route of <hi>Den-high,</hi> attended to that town by the three reſpectable citizens, Sir <hi>Francis Gamul,</hi> alderman <hi>Cooper,</hi> and captain <hi>Thropp.</hi> The ſiege was continued with the utmoſt vigour by Sir <hi>William Brereton;</hi> notwithſtanding which, the gallant garriſon held out for twenty weeks, beyond the expectation of every body: and, after having been reduced to live on horſes, dogs, and cats, yielded, on the 3d of <hi>February</hi> 1645-6, on terms that did honor to the ſpirit of the beſieged. The city was evacuated by the royaliſts; and received from the parlement, as governor, colonel <hi>Jones.</hi> But the miſeries of the citizens did not terminate with the ſiege: a dreadful peſtilence broke out in 1647: two thouſand inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants periſhed, and the city became almoſt a deſert.</p>
               <p>IN order to give a further hiſtory of the military,<note place="margin">BRIDGE.</note> civil, and eccleſiaſtical architecture of this antient city, I return to the bridge. This paſſage was prior to the Conqueſt; at which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod it ſeems to have been either deſtroyed, or found to be ſo much out of repair, that I find in <hi>Doomſday book</hi> an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the provoſt to ſummon one man from each hide of land in the county, in order to re-build the bridge and the walls; and, in caſe of neglect of appearance, the lord of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo ſummoned was to forfeit to the king and earl forty ſhillings.</p>
               <p>ACCORDING to a MS. quoted by Mr. <hi>Groſe,</hi> it was begun by the great reſtorer of the city, <hi>Ethelfieda,</hi> and after her death completed by her brother <hi>Edward.</hi> Before that time, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was by a ferry that plied between the poſtern, called the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0181900401:172"/>
                  <hi>Ship-gate,</hi> and <hi>Edgar</hi>'s field. It does not appear to me that any part of the <hi>Saxon</hi> bridge remains; ſo frequently has it been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired ſince that diſtant period.</p>
               <p>BENEATH the arch next to the city,<note place="margin">CAUSEWAY AND MILLS.</note> is a current, which, by means of a great dam or cauſeway that croſſes the river obliquely, ſupplies the city mills with water.

               <p>THIS and the other city gates were placed under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of certain great men, who held lands within the county palatine. The earl of <hi>Shrewſhury</hi> had the care of the <hi>Bridge-gate;</hi> the earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt-gate;</hi> the earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> of the <hi>Water-gate.</hi> But the <hi>North-gate,</hi> belonging peculiarly to the city, was intruſted only to its chief magiſtrates. Tolls were exacted at entrance, from all ſtrangers, for the ſupport of the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0181900401:174"/>
guard; and, notwithſtanding the cauſe has long ſince ceaſed, are ſtill demanded at the <hi>Bridge-gate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ABOVE the gate is a lofty octagonal tower,<note place="margin">WATER-WORKS.</note> begun in 1600, by permiſſion of the corporation, by <hi>John Tyrer</hi> of this city, containing the works which for a long time raiſed water out of the <hi>Dee</hi> to a ciſtern in the top, whence it was conveyed in pipes to almoſt all parts of the city. Poſſibly theſe did not anſwer their purpoſe effectually; for in 1622, <hi>Tyrer</hi> had a new grant of a tower erected for a water-work and a well-place, ten feet ſquare, near <hi>Spittle Boughton,</hi> with full powers for the conveyance of the water to the ciſtern or conduit near the high-croſs. This work (which was firſt begun by the <hi>black friers</hi> in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> I.<note n="*" place="bottom">De aquaeductu per ipſos (the black friers) faciendo a fonte prope furcas. Vide <hi>Tanner,</hi> 65.</note>) fell to decay. In 1692, the works undertaken by <hi>Tyrer</hi> being found to be ruinous and uſeleſs, <hi>John Hopkins</hi> and <hi>John Hadley,</hi> by the encouragement of the corporation, began new works for ſupplying the city with water from the river <hi>Dee:</hi> for this purpoſe, they purchaſed the grant made to <hi>Tyrer,</hi> and alſo one of the corn-mills, for the conveniency of placing their engine. The city confirmed to them all the powers formerly veſted in <hi>Tyrer,</hi> and particularly that of ſetting up a ciſtern oppoſite to the abby court, as a conſtant receptacle for freſh water.</p>
               <p>NEAR the <hi>Bridge-gate</hi> is one aſcent to the city walls;<note place="margin">WALLS.</note> which are the only entire ſpecimen of antient fortification now in <hi>Great Britain.</hi> They are a mile and three quarters, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

and one yards in circumference; and, being the principal walk of the inhabitants, are kept in excellent repair, by certain impoſts,<note place="margin">MURRACE</note> called murage duties, collected at the cuſtom-houſe, upon all goods and merchandize brought into the port of <hi>Cheſter</hi> from parts beyond the ſeas, belonging to perſons not freemen of the city. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> linen adds conſiderably to the fund, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearly two-thirds of the whole: the duty on this article is two pence on every hundred yards. The annual receipt of the different duties, on the average of the laſt ſeven years, is about 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0<hi>l..</hi> An officer, called a murenger, is choſen out of the body of the aldermen, to inſpect the repairs; generally an old member, to whom the duty affords amuſement and health. This fund is now permanent: in old times, the murage was only occaſional. Thus, in the 14th of <hi>Edward</hi> II. there was a grant for two years of a half-penny for every cranock of corn; and a farthing of ale, meal, and malt; and for commodities not expreſſed in the grant, a farthing out of every two ſhillings-worth.</p>
               <p>I CANNOT diſcover any veſtige of the original walls, ſuch as thoſe which are ſaid to have been reſtored by the warlike <hi>Ethelfleda.</hi> I would not willingly detract from the lady's merit; but I muſt deny her that of being the foundreſs of the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, and of enlarging the city beyond the <hi>Roman</hi> precincts. The form at preſent is ſo entirely <hi>Roman,</hi> that any addition ſhe could make would have deſtroyed the peculiar figure that wiſe people always preſerved in their ſtations or caſtrametations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the nature of the ground would permit. The antiquities which diſtinguiſh their reſidence are not found confined to any one quarter: they are met in digging on every ſide within the walls.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0181900401:176"/>THE military architecture is ſtill entirely on the <hi>Roman</hi> plan; it is probable, that after their retreat it fell into ruin, in the empoveriſhed, turbulent, and barbarous ages that ſucceeded, yet never was ſo totally demoliſhed, but that it might ſtill yield a defence to the poſſeſſors. We find it wreſted out of the hands of the <hi>Britons</hi> by <hi>Egbert,</hi> in 828: we again ſee it poſſeſſed by the <hi>Danes</hi> in 895, and beſieged by <hi>Alfred,</hi> who ſlew all the banditti whom he found <hi>without the walls;</hi> and, laſtly, we find it taken by <hi>Ethelfleda,</hi> by the voluntary ſurrender of the garriſon. All this proves a continuance of the fortifications, probably ruinous, and wanting that reſtoration which they found from that illuſtrious woman.</p>
               <p>WE ſee the <hi>Roman</hi> mode of fortification preſerved to this day, exactly on the antient plan. From each ſide of the gates projects a <hi>propugnaculum</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vegetius,</hi> lib. iv. c. 4.</note> or baſtion, in order to annoy the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my who attempted to enter; and between them, in the very entrance, was the <hi>cataracta</hi> or portcullis, ready to be dropt in caſe they forced the gates, ſo that part of them might be caught within the walls, and the reſt excluded. Should it happen that they ſet the gates on fire, there were holes above, in order to pour down water to extinguiſh the flames.</p>
               <p>THE walls are in many parts, eſpecially on the north and caſt ſides, guarded by towers, placed ſo as not to be beyond bow-ſhot of one another, in order that the archers might reach the enemy who attempted to attack the intervals<note n="†" place="bottom">Intervalla autem turrium ita ſunt facienda ut ne longius ſit alia ab alia ſagittae intermiſſione, &amp;c, <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> lib. i. c. 5.</note>. They alſo
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0181900401:177"/>
are moſtly of a round form, as was recommended by the <hi>Roman</hi> architects, in order the better to elude the force of battering rams<note n="*" place="bottom">Turres itaque rotundae aut polygoniae ſunt faciendae, <hi>quadratas</hi> enim ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinae celerius diſſipant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ibid.

               <p>THE thickneſs of the walls anſwer to the breadth preſcribed by <hi>Vitruvius.</hi> Only two perſons can walk abreaſt, excepting where the ground adjacent gives a larger expanſe. The great architect directs, that they ſhould be of ſuch a breadth, that two armed men may paſs each other without any impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment.</p>
               <p>THE city to this time enjoys the four gates; anſwerable to the <hi>principalis dextra &amp; ſiniſtra, praetoria &amp; decumana.</hi> The <hi>Eaſt-gate,</hi> one of the <hi>principales,</hi> exiſted within my memory.</p>
               <p>MY walk leads me beneath the caſtle, to another of the <hi>principales,</hi> the preſent <hi>Water-gate,</hi> that opens towards the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and near which the <hi>Dee</hi> in former times flowed.</p>
               <p>AT the extreme angle of the city, beyond this gate, is a ſalient tower, exactly round,<note place="margin">WATER-TOWER.</note> unleſs where interrupted by a ſmall ſquared projection at the entrance. This tower is joined to the walls by a deep open gallery, embattled on each ſide, beneath is a large arch for the paſſage of the tide, before the late inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which alſo are within my remembrance. This tower is at preſent called the <hi>Water-tower.</hi> It jutted into the antient chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel or the river, where the ſhips lay, which faſtened their cables
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0181900401:178"/>
to its ſides by the great iron rings infixed in the ſtone. This tower was formerly called the new; yet was founded in 1320; for there exiſts a contract for that purpoſe, between the mayor and citizens of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and one <hi>John de Helpſton,</hi> maſon, for building <hi>quandam turrem rotundum,</hi> &amp;c. a round tower <q>of the thickneſs of ten yards and a half, with a cavity within; twenty-four yards high, and ſo ſtrong as to be defenſible;</q> and all this for the ſum of one hundred pounds<note n="*" place="bottom">Harleian MSS. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2046. 10.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE next remarkable outlet is the <hi>North-gate,</hi> beyond which is a large ſuburb.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Phoenix</hi> tower ſtands on the angle of the walls beyond this gate. The preſent tower was built in 1613, and was uſed by ſix of the companies of the city as a chamber for buſineſs. It took its name from the fabulous bird, the creſt of the painter-ſtainers company, which was placed in front.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Eaſt-gate</hi> is the next entrance.<note place="margin">EAST-GATE.</note> Here ſtood a lofty ſquare tower, with many apartments, erected (according to tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) by <hi>Edward</hi> III. This had been a <hi>Porta principalis,</hi> was the grand entrance into the town, and was the termination of the great <hi>Watling-ſtreet</hi> road, which croſſed the iſland from <hi>Dover,</hi> and was the great road from that port to this place. In 1769, this gate, being found too narrow and inconvenient, was pulled down, and a magnificent arch aroſe in its room, at the ſole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of <hi>Richard</hi> lord <hi>Groſvenour.</hi> Beyond this is a vaſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urb, called the <hi>Foreſt-ſtreet;</hi> whoſe lower part was defended by a gate, demoliſhed as a nuſance within theſe few years.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0181900401:179"/>AFTER paſſing the <hi>Eaſt-gate,</hi> the traveller will obſerve, without the walls, a vaſt foſs cut through the live rock, now a common road to the water; but which appears to me to have been a work of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as a defence on this ſide, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues the rectangular ſhape of the ſtation.</p>
               <p>THE views from the ſeveral parts of the walls are extremely elegant.<note place="margin">FINE-VIEWS.</note> The mountains of <hi>Flintſhire</hi> and <hi>Denbighſhire,</hi> the hills of <hi>Broxton,</hi> and the inſulated rock of <hi>Beeſton,</hi> form the ruder part of the ſcenery, a rich flat gives a ſofter view; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect up the river towards <hi>Boughton</hi> recalls, in ſome degree, the idea of the <hi>Thames</hi> and <hi>Richmond-bill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ON the Conqueſt, as has been before related, the king viſited this city in perſon, and reſtored the fortifications, It is probable that he only repaired the walls, but that he entirely re-built the caſtle<note n="*" place="bottom">Ordericus Vitalis, 516.</note> on the <hi>Norman</hi> model, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged it far beyond the dimenſions of that of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> which occupied the ſummit of the mount or little hill on which the fortreſs ſtands. That part is artificial, in order to give a great elevation, as was cuſtomary in the <hi>Saxon</hi> keeps; and the portion ſo flung up appears here to have been a mixture of ſtones and exceedingly hard clay.</p>
               <p>THE caſtle is compoſed of two parts, an upper and a lower: each with a ſtrong gate,<note place="margin">CASTLE.</note> defended by a round baſtion on each ſide, with a ditch, and formerly with draw-bridges. Within the precincts of the upper <hi>Ballium</hi> are to be ſeen ſome towers of <hi>Norman</hi> architecture, ſquare, with ſquare projections at each
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0181900401:180"/>
corner, very ſlightly ſalient. The handſomeſt is that called <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar</hi>'s. Its entrance is through a large Gothic door, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably of later workmanſhip. The loweſt room has a vaulted roof, ſtrengthened with ordinary ſquare couples. The upper had been a chapel, as appears by the holy-water pot, and ſome figures, almoſt obſolete, painted on the walls. Its dimenſions are nineteen feet four inches, by ſixteen ſix, the height alſo ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen feet ſix. The roof is vaulted; but the couples, which are rounded, ſlender, and elegant, run down the walls, and reſt on the cornuted capitals of five ſhort but beautiful round pillars, in the ſame ſtyle with thoſe in the chapter-houſe of the cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral; probably the work of the ſame architect. The arſenal, ſome batteries, and certain habitable buildings, occupy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part.</p>
               <p>ON the ſides of the lower court ſtands the noble room called <hi>Hugh Lupus</hi>'s hall,<note place="margin">LUPUS'S HALL.</note> in which the courts of juſtice for the county are held. The length is very near ninety-nine feet; the breadth forty-five; the height very aweful, and worthy the ſtate-apartment of a great baron. The roof ſupported by wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, in a bold ſtyle, carved; and placed on the ſides, reſting on ſtout brackets.</p>
               <p>THIS magnificent building probably retains its original dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The character of the firſt <hi>Norman</hi> earl required a hall ſuited to the greatneſs of his hoſpitality; which was confined to no bounds. 'He was,' ſays <hi>Ordericus</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib, iv. p 522.</note>, <q>not only liberal, but proſuſe. He did not carry a family with him, but an army.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0181900401:181"/>
He kept no account of receits or diſburſements. He was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually waſting his eſtates: and was much fonder of falconers and huntſmen, than of cultivators of the land and holy men: and by his gluttony he grew ſo exceſſively fat, that he could hardly crawl about.</q>
               </p>
               <p>ADJOINING to the end of this great hall is the court of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,<note place="margin">EXCHEQUER</note> or the chancery of the county palatine of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> The earl of <hi>Cholmondely</hi> is the preſent chamberlain; Sir <hi>Richard Perrin,</hi> my worthy countryman, ſits and diſcharges the office of vice-chamberlain. In reſpect to matters of equity, he here acts as lord chancellor. The chamberlain was one of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient earl's great officers, and had a fee of twenty-two pounds a year. This very building is ſaid to have been the parlement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of the little kings of the palatinate. It ſavors of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in the architecture; and within are a number of ſeats deſcribed by Gothic arches and neat pillars; at the upper end are two; one for the earl, the other for the abbot. The eight others were allotted to his eight barons, [and occupy one ſide of the room.</p>
               <p>UNDER the vice-chamberlain is a baron, who holds a weekly court, in which appearances are entered for bringing cauſes to a trial. Writs and ſubpoenas are alſo here made out, as well for the great ſeſſions for this county, as for thoſe of the county of <hi>Flint.</hi> Here is, beſides, an examiner; and a ſeal-keeper, who has the charge of the records.</p>
               <p>THE judges have lodgings within the caſtle, during their circuit, by antient cuſtom. Theſe are furniſhed by the ſheriffs of the city. The ſheriffs of the county take care of their horſes; but
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0181900401:182"/>
are allowed the expences when they bring in their accounts at the audit.</p>
               <p>THE county jail for felons and debtors is the laſt place to be deſcribed.<note place="margin">JAIL</note> I can do little more than confirm the account of it by the humane <hi>Howard.</hi> Their day-confinement is in a little yard, ſurrounded on all ſides by lofty buildings, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the air, excepting from above, and ever unviſited by the purifying rays of the ſun. Their nocturnal apartments are in cells ſeven feet and a half by three and a half; ranged on one ſide of a ſubterraneous dungeon; in each of which are often lodged three or four perſons. The whole is rendered more (wholeſomely) horrible, by being pitched over three or four times in the year. The ſcanty air of their ſtreight priſon-yard is to travel through three paſſages to arrive at them: through the window of an adjacent room; through a grate in the floor of the ſaid room into the dungeon; and finally, through the dungeon, through a little grate above the door of each of their kennels. In ſuch places as theſe are the innocent and the guilty permitted to be lodged, till the law decides their fate. I am ſure the humane keeper, Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> muſt feel many a pang at the neceſſary diſcharge of his duty. Mr. HOWARD compares the place to the black-hole at <hi>Calcutta.</hi> The view I had of it, aſſiſted to raiſe the idea of a much worſe priſon where</p>
               <q>
                  <l>No light, but rather darkneſs viſible,</l>
                  <l>Served only to diſcover ſights of woe.</l>
               </q>
               <p>The conſtable of the caſtle holds his place for life; is properly the keeper of the priſon; but appoints a deputy. He is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0181900401:183"/>
for all priſoners and debtors, and anſwerable for their eſcapes.</p>
               <p>WITHIN the walls of this fortreſs, was an inſtance of a felon ſuffering <hi>priſon forte et dure,</hi> for ſtanding mute on his trial, till he died of hunger.<note place="margin">PRISON FORTE IT DURE.</note> One <hi>Adam,</hi> ſon of <hi>John,</hi> of the <hi>Woodhouſes,</hi> was, in 1310, the 4th of <hi>Edward</hi> II. committed for burning his own houſes, and carrying away the goods.

                     <hi>Harleian</hi> MSS, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2079. 63.</note>. This was the origin of the puniſhment of preſſing to death, or the <hi>peine forte et dure,</hi> which ſeems a ſort of merciful haſtening of death; for it muſt have been much more horrible, as well as tedious, in the manner preſcribed by the law of the firſt <hi>Edward,</hi> in whoſe reign it ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated.

               </p>
               <p>THE term <hi>ad dietam</hi> was ironical, expreſſive of the ſad ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the ſufferer was allowed; <hi>viz.</hi> on the firſt day, three morſels of the worſt bread; on the ſecond, three draughts of water out of the next puddle: and this was to be alternately his daily diet till he died.</p>
               <p>MR. RYMER records a ſtrange inſtance of a woman at <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> who underwent this puniſhment, and lived forty days

               <p>THERE is a ſingularity in the manner of the treatment of the priſoners who are releaſed by capital puniſhment out of their dreadful cells, which merits mention. They are delivered by the conſtable or his deputy, at a ſtone called <hi>Glover's-ſtone,</hi> about ninety yards diſtant from the outward gate, into the hands of the ſheriffs of the city; who receive them at that ſtone, which is the extreme limit of the caſtle precincts, and from thence convey them to the place of execution, which they alſo have the charge of. This cuſtom is not accounted for, any more than by tradition, that a felon was formerly reſcued in his way to the gallows by the citizens of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and perhaps by the connivance of the magiſtrates, who are ſuppoſed to have had the diſagreeable duty inflicted on them of executing all criminals, whether they are of the county or the city.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0181900401:185"/>THE city was ſeparated from the caſtle, and made a county of itſelf, by the charter of <hi>Henry</hi> VII: the caſtle was left as an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertance to the ſhire; and has the ſmall outlet of a little ſtreet called <hi>Glover's-ſtone,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">GLOVER'S STONE.</note> which is alſo independent of the city; and in which non-freemen may ſet up any trade unmoleſted by the corporation.</p>
               <p>THE caſtle has a governor, lieutenant-governor, and conſtable; and is garriſoned by two companies of invalids.</p>
               <p>THE civil government and architecture is next to be taken notice of. I have, in my account of <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> CHES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER, given a brief relation of the government of the city in thoſe periods. I ſhall at preſent only mention the principal charters; and flatter myſelf, that the reader will excuſe my brevity, not only as it is beyond the power of the travelling topographer to collect the ſame materials as the reſident; but becauſe his curioſity will, it is to be hoped, ſoon be ſatisfied by the publication of the hiſtory of this city by the Reverend Doctor GOWER, which will amply ſupply all my defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies.</p>
               <p>THE firſt royal charter which this city was honored with is that of <hi>Henry</hi> III;<note place="margin">CHARTERS.</note> who confirms all the priveleges beſtowed on them by the <hi>Norman</hi> earls, and, I imagine, firſt flung the government into the form of a regular corporation; for he grants and confirms to them, that none ſhall buy or ſell mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe in the city except citizens, unleſs it be in the fairs, under the penalty of ten pounds.</p>
               <p>EDWARD I. gave the city of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> with the appertenances, and all the liberties and priveleges, to its citizens and their heirs,

               <p>EDWARD the black prince preſcribed by particular names the boundaries of the city, beginning at the <hi>Iron-bridge,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Saltney,</hi> the <hi>Port-pool, Flukerſbrook, Boughton,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>RICHARD II. was particularly kind to his favorite city. In conſideration of ſome diſtreſſes it had undergone, he releaſed them from the payment of ſeventy-three pounds ten ſhillings and eight-pence arrears of rent due to the crown: he gave them the profits of the ferry towards the re-building and repairing of <hi>Dee</hi> bridge: he made them two grants of the murage, the firſt for four years, the ſecond for five, for the repairs of the walls.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0181900401:187"/>
But in the 22d year of his reign, <q>for the furtherance of juſtice in the ſame city, and better execution thereof, he grants unto his ſubjects, majors, ſheriffs, and commonalty of the ſaid city, to hold their courts; and limited what proceſſes they might award in, actions, perſonal felonies, appeals, proceſſes of utlagary, as at common law. Granted under the ſeal of the principality of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> at <hi>Cheſter, May</hi> 2, 1398<note n="*" place="bottom">King, ii. 159</note>.</q> This ſeems to have been found neceſſary, in order to ſtrengthen the civil policy of this place, which had four years before been greatly inſulted by a dreadful riot in the abby by Sir <hi>Baldwyne</hi> of <hi>Radyngſtone,</hi> ſupported by Sir <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Stanley</hi> with eight hundred men. A ſheriff was killed, and many other exceſſes committed<note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>AFTER the revolution which happened in 1399, the mayor and citizens continued to favor the cauſe of their depoſed maſter; and after his death, gave all the aſſiſtance in their power to <hi>Harry Percy.</hi> On his defeat, they obtained the royal pardon; and in order to conciliate their affections, young <hi>Henry</hi> prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> confirmed all their former charters and priveleges; and afterwards granted to them the profits of murage and bridge tower, where tolls were collected, <hi>durante bene placito.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN a confirmation of the former charters by <hi>Henry</hi> VI. we learn the former concourſe of ſtrangers; the greatneſs of the commerce of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> by reaſon of the goodneſs of its port; and the great trade carried on in proviſions into and out of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0181900401:188"/>
                  <hi>Wales.</hi> It farther recites the melancholy change of affairs; the conflux of foreign merchants being put a ſtop to by the choaking of the creek with ſands; and the intercourſe with <hi>Wales</hi> deſtroyed, ſince the inſurrection of <hi>Owen Glendwr:</hi> which conſiderations moved the king to remit ten pounds of the antient fee-farm rent.</p>
               <p>THE proviſions alluded to were probably cheeſes, on the part of the citizens of <hi>Cheſter;</hi> and perhaps wines, ſpices, and other foreign luxuries; for which they might receive in exchange from the <hi>Welſh,</hi> cattle of different kinds.</p>
               <p>HENRY VII.<note place="margin">MEMBERS.</note> in 1506, in conſideration of farther diſtreſſes of the city, not only remitted eighty pounds of its annual rent; but granted it a new charter, by which he ſeparated it from the county, and granted it ſeveral of the moſt valuable prive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges which it ſtill enjoys: but being a county palatine, and in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> I. veſted in the crown, never received ſummons, either for county or city, to return members to parlement, till the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. when the county, in 1543, was empowered to ſend two knights, and the city two citizens. The electors of the laſt are the freemen of the city; the returning-officers the ſheriffs.</p>
               <p>THE corporation conſiſts of a mayor,<note place="margin">CORPORATION.</note> recorder, two ſheriff s, twenty-four aldermen, and forty common-council. Here are beſide two annual officers, called <hi>leave-lookers,</hi> whoſe buſineſs was to prevent all perſons who are not free of the city from exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing any trade, or expoſing to ſale any wares or merchandiſe within the liberties. They were accuſtomed to go round the city in order to preſerve theſe its privileges; and ſometimes were uſed
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0181900401:189"/>
to take ſmall ſums, called <hi>leave-lookerage,</hi> for <hi>leave</hi> for non-free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ſell wares by retail; but at preſent the yeoman of the Pentiſe diſcharges this office, and returns the names of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are found to offend, in order that actions might be brought againſt them. We find, as early as 1297, that ſimilar officers were elected, under the name of <hi>cuſtos guild mercator;</hi> and who diſcharged the ſame function<note n="*" place="bottom">King, ii. 167.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE places where the mayor and other officers of the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration aſſemble for the diſpatch of buſineſs,<note place="margin">PEXTISE.</note> or adminiſtration of juſtice, are two; the firſt is the Pentiſe, an antient building in the center of the city, near the junction of the four principal ſtreets. Mention is made of the north-ſide having been builded in 1497. Here all buſineſs within the cognizance of a juſtice of the peace is tranſacted; the aldermen that have paſt the chair being empowered to act as long as they wear the gown. Here alſo the ſheriffs, aſſiſted by the recorder, ſit and determine civil cauſes.</p>
               <p>I IMAGINE that this building,<note place="margin">PRAETORIUM.</note> St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s church, and a few houſes to the north and weſt, occupy the ſite of the <hi>Roman Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium;</hi> for they not only fill the very ſituation of that part of the old caſtrametations, but account for the diſcontinuance of the <hi>Bridge ſtreet,</hi> which ceaſes oppoſite to theſe edifices. This alſo is the cauſe why the nearer part of the <hi>North-gate ſtreet</hi> is thrown out of its courſe, and falls into the <hi>Eaſt-gate ſtreet,</hi> many yards beyond the mouth of the <hi>Bridge ſtreet;</hi> for the lower part of the <hi>North-gate ſtreet,</hi> where the exchange and ſhambles ſtand.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0181900401:190"/>
points directly towards the former; but is interrupted by the ſpace occupied by theſe buildings. The limit of the <hi>Praetorium</hi> on the eaſt, was the narrow portion of <hi>North-gate ſtreet;</hi> on the ſouth, part of the preſent <hi>Bridge, Eaſt-gate,</hi> and <hi>Water-gate ſtreets;</hi> on the weſt <hi>Goſs lane;</hi> and on the north, the ſpace now occupied by the fiſh-market. The <hi>praetorium,</hi> with its attendants, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded no ſmall ſpace; for, beſides the ſpot poſſeſſed by the general, were the apartments of the <hi>imperatoris contubernales,</hi> or the young nobility immediately under his care; the <hi>augurale,</hi> where prayers, ſacrifices, and other religious rites were performed, which might have ſtood on the ſite of the modern church; and the general might have had his tribunal on the very ſpot where the worſhipful corporation at preſent ſit for the redreſs of grievances.</p>
               <p>THE courts of juſtice are held in the common hall,<note place="margin">EXCHANGE.</note> a large and commodious room over the exchange, adorned with the portraits of ſeveral popular perſons: among them is a full-length of Sir <hi>William Williams,</hi> recorder of this city, ſpeaker of the houſe of commons in the reign of <hi>Charles</hi> II. and ſolicitor-general in that of his ſucceſſor. In this place are held a crown-mote court, portmote court, and court of ſeſſions. The mayor, aſſiſted by the recorder, is judge of the crownmote court. He has juriſdiction in all criminal cauſes, treaſon only excepted. He is alſo judge of the portmote court, with the ſame aſſiſtant. This court holds plea in all actions real, perſonal, and mixed. In the court of ſeſſions, the aldermen above the chair try petty-larcenies, and determine upon inferior offences. In this place, the body corporate hold their aſſemblies for making bye-laws
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0181900401:191"/>
for the government of the city; for managing the public build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and directing the charities; and finally, the city elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of magiſtrates, as well as members, are made in this court.</p>
               <p>THE only remains of any <hi>hotel,</hi> and that of no antient date, ſtood in <hi>Old Common-ball lane;</hi> which, when entire, ſurrounded a ſquare, and communicated with <hi>Water-gate ſtreet.</hi> It was founded by Sir <hi>Thomas Egerton,</hi> chamberlain of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> afterwards lord chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>England,</hi> and deſigned by him for a dwelling-houſe. The ſmall remainder, which faced the lane, and was occupied by a poor family, on the 5th of <hi>November</hi> 1772, was the ſcene of a dreadful calamity. The firſt floor was engaged by a puppet-ſhow man; and at the moment he was exhibiting to a very full audience, by ſome unknown accident 800 pounds weight of gunpowder, which was lodged in a warehouſe beneath, took fire, and blew up three ſtories. Twenty-three people pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and eighty-three were much burnt, bruiſed, and received broken and diſlocated limbs; of which number only three died, and thoſe with locked jaws. The remedy found moſt efficacious for the burnt, was <hi>Goulard</hi>'s extract of lead.</p>
               <p>THE external effects of this exploſion were theſe: the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and broken glaſs of ſeveral of the neighboring houſes fell outwards; from which it appears, that they were not broken by the ſhock of the gunpowder, but by the preſſure of the air within the apartments, which ruſhed out into the <hi>vacuum</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the exploſion. A ſimilar phaenomenon has been remarked from an exploſion from the inflammable vapor of a mine, when the neighboring trees fell towards the blaſt. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0181900401:192"/>
where the force of the powder was confined by narrow paſſages, its centrifugal effect took place; for two boys, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the rows in <hi>Water-gate ſtreet,</hi> oppoſite to a paſſage leading to the building, were blown, one againſt the rails, the other into the ſtreet; and the roof of a houſe was blown off, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite a paſſage into <hi>Common-hall lane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is much to be wiſhed, that the eaſy magiſtracy of this city would, from this dire accident, take into conſideration the ſafety of the whole, in preference to the conveniency of a few lazy individuals; and either compel them to keep by them only the legal quantity, or at their ſeſſion appoint proper places for lodging gunpowder. This is the ſecond tremendous warning of the ſame nature which the city hath been viſited with. On the firſt of <hi>April</hi> 1726, the ſhop of Mr. <hi>Thomas Murray</hi> in <hi>Bridge ſtreet,</hi> and the houſe, were blown up; and himſelf and a young gentleman killed. Notwithſtanding this double admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I fear its attention ſtill continues lethargic.</p>
               <p>THE ſurviving ſufferers of this calamity were relieved<note n="*" place="bottom">630 <hi>l.</hi> was alſo immediately collected from the humane inhabitants of the city, to be diſtributed among theſe miſerable maimed objects.</note> in the well-regulated infirmary eſtabliſhed here, and ſupported by the voluntary contributions from the city, county, and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring parts of <hi>Wales.</hi> It is a handſome building, in an airy ſituation, and detached from the ſtreets. This charity was founded in 1756, and originated from a bequeſt of 300 <hi>l.</hi> left by Dr. <hi>Stratford,</hi> commiſſary of <hi>Richmond,</hi> towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing of a public hoſpital in this city. Subſcriptions were
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0181900401:193"/>
circulated, and a ſum equal to the deſign ſoon raiſed. Before the preſent building could be ready for the reception of patients, a temporary infirmary was prepared for them, in 1756, in <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate ſtreet.</hi> The new infirmary was opened on the 17th of <hi>March</hi> 1761; and has been ſupported with a ſpirit that does honor to the environs; which has enabled the managers to receive, ſince its inſtitution, not fewer than thirteen thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty-ſix objects of relief. The portrait of the founder is placed in the council-room of the infirmary; a three-quarters piece, ſitting, in a long wig and civilian's gown.</p>
               <p>I SHALL now take a ſhort view of the eccleſiaſtical ſtate of this antient city. It is neceſſary firſt to obſerve, that the <hi>Mercian</hi> kingdom was divided into five biſhopricks; <hi>Lichfield, Cheſter, Worceſter, Lydneceſter,</hi> and <hi>Dorcheſter;</hi> which laſt was afterwards removed to <hi>Lincoln. Lichfield</hi> was made, about the year 785, metropolitan, by order of <hi>Offa,</hi> and afterwards, for a long ſpace, incorporated into itſelf its ſuffragan, <hi>Cheſter.</hi> How greatly the laſt flouriſhed is evident from an account of its annual payment to the pope in very early times; for, when <hi>Lichfield</hi> payed only three thouſand florins, our ſee advanced five thouſand. No wonder that its jealouſy ſhould be excited! Very little is known of the ſtate of this church in the <hi>Saxon</hi> period. Let it ſuffice to ſay, that a biſhop of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> of the name of <hi>Peter,</hi> in the year 1075, removed his epiſcopal ſeat to <hi>Cheſter;</hi> and during his life made uſe of the church of St. <hi>John</hi>'s for his cathedral. This tranſlation was of very ſhort date; for his ſucceſſor eſtabliſhed himſelf in the former dioceſe, and <hi>Cheſter</hi> continued without a biſhop till the diſſolution of monaſteries; when, in 1541,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0181900401:194"/>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. reſtored it to its former honor, by creating it one of the ſix<note n="*" place="bottom">Weſtminſter, Oxford, Briſtol, Gloſter, Peterborough, <hi>and</hi> Cheſter. <hi>The firſt was ſuppreſſed in the reign of queen</hi> Mary.</note> new ſees formed on that great event; and converted the church of the late abby of St. <hi>Werburgh</hi> into the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral.</p>
               <p>THE firſt of the new biſhops was <hi>John Bird,</hi> a <hi>Carmelite,</hi> and provincial of the order; a man ſubſervient to the court; who, by preaching againſt the pope's ſupremacy, ſo recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended himſelf to the king as to obtain the biſhoprick of <hi>Bangor;</hi> from whence he was removed to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> as a fit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuit the rapacity of the times. In 1546, he granted away the whole of the manors and demeſnes of the ſee, and, accepting impropriation inſtead of them, left his ſucceſſors not a ſingle acre, excepting that on which the palace ſtands, and the court before it; another houſe, adjacent; a little orchard called the <hi>Woodyard;</hi> two houſes near St. <hi>John</hi>'s church; and a few ſmall tenements in the city of <hi>York.</hi> Notwithſtanding the ſum he amaſſed, he was found, at the acceſſion of <hi>Mary,</hi> in debt to the crown 1087 <hi>l.</hi> 18 <hi>s.</hi> for tenths and ſubſidies; a vaſt ſum for the times! His intereſt with biſhop <hi>Bonner</hi> ſtill would have ſaved him, had he not committed (in thoſe days) the heinous crime of matrimony, for which he was deprived in 1554.</p>
               <p>HE left his dioceſe one of the leſt in value, yet greateſt: in extent, of any in <hi>England;</hi> for it reaches from <hi>Hawarden</hi> in <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> to the river <hi>Derwent</hi> in <hi>Cumberland:</hi> comprehending the entire counties of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire;</hi> part of <hi>Weſtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0181900401:195"/>
                  <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Richmondſhire</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> the chapelties of <hi>Holt</hi> and <hi>Iſcoed;</hi> the churches of <hi>Hawarden, Hanmer, Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, Worthenhury,</hi> and the chapelry of <hi>Orton Maddoc,</hi> in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent parts or <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE abby,<note place="margin">ABBY.</note> out of which this ſee was formed, was of great antiquity. Hiſtory relates, that it had been originally a nunnery, founded about the year 660, by <hi>Wulpherus,</hi> king of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> in favor of his daughter's indiſpoſition to a married life. This was the celebrated St. <hi>Werburgh,</hi> who took the veil after living immaculate for three years with her huſband <hi>Ceolredus,</hi> after the example of her aunt, the great <hi>Ethelreda;</hi> who coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited for three years with no leſs purity with her firſt ſpouſe <hi>Tonberctus,</hi> and for twelve with her ſecond, the pious prince <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frid.</hi> St. <hi>Werburgh</hi> preſided over ſeveral <hi>Mercian</hi> monaſteries, died at <hi>Tricengham,</hi> and by her own order was interred at <hi>Heanburge;</hi> but on the approach of the <hi>Danes,</hi> in 875, her body was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> as a place of ſecurity from the inſults of thoſe pagans<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiden <hi>in</hi> Gale, iii. 240.</note>.</p>
               <p>IT is uncertain how long this community exiſted. It probably was ruined by the ravages of the barbarians in 895, and finally ſuppreſſed; for we are told<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, that from the reign of king <hi>Athelſtan,</hi> in 925, to the coming of the <hi>Normans,</hi> a ſet of canons ſecular were eſtabliſhed in the place of the nuns. This pious deed was that of <hi>Ethelſleda;</hi> who reſtored the buildings; which afterwards were repaired by earl <hi>Leofric,</hi> huſband to the famous <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diva.</hi> The houſe was richly endowed by the kings <hi>Edmund</hi> and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0181900401:196"/>
                  <hi>Edgar,</hi> and by <hi>Leofric. Edgar</hi>'s charter begins in a ſtrain equally pious and ſublime<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Dugdale,</hi> Monaſt. i. 200.</note>.</p>
               <p>ON the acceſſion of <hi>Hugh Lupus</hi> to this earldom, he ſuppreſſed the canons ſecular, and eſtabliſhed in their place a colony of his countrymen, <hi>Benedictines,</hi> from <hi>Bec</hi> in <hi>Normandy;</hi> for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably he did not care to truſt his ſalvation to the prayers of the <hi>Saxon</hi> religious. It is ſaid, that this piece of piety was owing to a fit of illneſs which the earl was ſeized with; when he took the uſual way in thoſe days of ſoothing a troubled conſcience. <hi>Anſelm,</hi> abbot of <hi>Bec,</hi> and afterwards archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> regulated the new foundation; and appointed his chaplain <hi>Richard</hi> to be the firſt abbot. <hi>Lupus</hi> and his ſucceſſors were very liberal in their endowments<note n="†" place="bottom">Idem, 985, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>; and the place flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed till its diſſolution; which was effected by the ſurrender of the laſt abbot, <hi>Thomas Clerk;</hi> who received in reward the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the new deanry, which he enjoyed only ſix weeks. The revenues of this great abby were, according to <hi>Dugdale,</hi> 1003 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> II <hi>d.</hi> to Speed, 1073 <hi>l.</hi> 17 <hi>s.</hi> 7 <hi>d.</hi>

               <p>ACCORDING to a ſurvey of this abby, preſerved in the <hi>Harleian</hi> collection, its extent was very conſiderable; ſurrounding the preſent ſquare, and covering ſeveral parts of the adjacent ground. The old abby-court is adorned on two ſides by very handſome modern houſes, built between the years 1750 and 1754, on leaſes granted by the dean and chapter. Another ſide is filled by the new palace; an elegant pile, which roſe under the auſpices of that munificent and hoſpitable prelate <hi>Edmund</hi>

                  <hi>Keen,</hi> preſent biſhop of <hi>Ely.</hi> Its place was before occupied by the houſe of the antient abbots.</p>
               <p>THE old gate is yet ſtanding: is a plain but noble entrance; and conſiſts, towards the ſtreet, of two Gothic arches included within a round one, of great diameter; and which appears <hi>to</hi> have been of far older date. One ſide was the porter's lodge; on the other, a place called St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s court. A chapel, dedicated to the ſame ſaint, ſtood where the preſent deanry is; and, from its antient appearance, ſeems to have been externally the ſame building.</p>
               <p>THE cloiſters are entire; but conſiſt only of three walks, the court extending on one ſide quite to the church. By the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent arms on the roof, it appears to have been repaired at ſeveral times, from the time of <hi>Edward</hi> III. to that of <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>ON one ſide ſtood the fratry;<note place="margin">SCHOOL</note> a vaſt room, which is uſed as a free-ſchool, founded by <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. in the 36th year of his reign, for twenty-four boys, who are appointed by the dean and chapter: they may continue there four years, if their conduct be regular; but the dean has power to grant a year of grace. No boy (unleſs he be a choiriſter) ought to be choſen before he is nine years old, or after he is fifteen. Two maſters are appointed for their inſtruction, a chief and an under maſter; elected by the dean and chapter.</p>
               <p>IN a corner of the eaſt-ſide of the cloiſter, is a paſſage and ſtairs to the dormitory; and the antient prieſts cellars and kitchen. On the ſame ſide is a paſſage, formerly called the Maidens aile,</p>

               <p>THE beautiful edifice,<note place="margin">CHAPTER-HOUSE.</note> the chapter-houſe, ſtands in the ſame walk, of the cloiſter. The veſtibule is arched, ſupported by four columns, each ſurrounded with eight ſlender pilaſters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out capitals, which converge near the top of the column, and ſpread over the roof. The dimenſions of this room are thirty-three feet four inches, by twenty-ſeven four; the height twelve feet nine. On the ſides is a ſtone-feat for the attendants on the buſineſs of the chapter.</p>
               <p>THE chapter-houſe is fifty feet long, twenty-ſix feet broad, end thirty-five feet high; at the upper end is a window, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of five lancet-ſhaped diviſions; and on each ſide is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of three. At the height of eight feet and a half from the floor, a narrow gallery runs along three parts of the room, divided from the windows by a triplet of moſt elegant, lofty, ſlender pillars. The roof is of ſtone; the ſprings of the arches which ſecure it, are ſupported by neat pilaſters with palmy capitals.</p>
               <p>THE modern book-caſes deform the lower parts of the room, as high as the bottoms of the windows. The walls, 1 conjecture, had been ornamented with pilaſters, and had a ſtone-ſeat like that of the veſtibule. The entrance, both from the cloiſters and between the veſtibule and the chapter-houſe, are Gothic; but apparently of a later ſpecies of architecture than either of thoſe rooms.</p>
               <p>THE chapter-houſe was built, in all probability, in the time of <hi>Rendle the firſt,</hi> earl of <hi>Cheſler,</hi> who died in 1128, after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0181900401:200"/>
his earldom eight years. The great earl, <hi>Hugh Lupus</hi> uncle to <hi>Randle,</hi> had been interred in the church-yard of the abby: the firſt care of the nephew was to remove the body into this building<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Leiceſter's Hiſt.</hi> Antiq. 127.</note>, as the moſt honorable place; a reſpect which would certainly have been payed to it, had this edifice exiſted at the time of his death. Here his remains continued unmoleſted till the year 1724, when, in digging within the chapter-houſe, they were found in a ſtone coffin, wrapped in leather, with a croſs on the breaſt; and at the head of the coffin a ſtone in ſhape of a T, with the wolf's head, the alluſion to his name, engraven on it. Other coffins were diſcovered beneath the two rooms, of earls, their counteſſes, or of abbots; but the great leveller death had reduced them to duſt indiſtinguiſhable.</p>
               <p>THE earls who were interred here, were <hi>Hugh,</hi> who died in 1101; <hi>Randle the firſt,</hi> or <hi>de Meſchina,</hi> in 1128; <hi>Randle the ſecond,</hi> or <hi>de Gernouns,</hi> who was poiſoned in 1155, by <hi>William Peverel; Hugh Cyvelioc,</hi> who died at <hi>Leek</hi> in 1181; <hi>Randle the third,</hi> or <hi>de Blundeville,</hi> who died at <hi>Wallingford</hi> in 1232, where his bowels were interred; his heart was buried at the abby of <hi>Dieulacres</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and his body tranſported to <hi>Cheſter:</hi> finally, <hi>John Scot,</hi> who, in 1237, underwent the ſame fate as <hi>Randle the ſecond.</hi> So that every earl of the <hi>Norman</hi> line were depoſited here, excepting <hi>Richard,</hi> who periſhed by ſhipwreck; in 1120<note n="†" place="bottom">The particulars of the deaths of this illuſtriou. line may be ſeen is LEICESTER: or in DUGDALE'S <hi>Baronage,</hi> i. 32, &amp;c.</note>.</p>

               <p>THE church bounds the north ſide of the cloiſters. The lower part of the wall has a row of arches, now filled up, and ſavors more of antiquity than any other part, This, and a portion of the north-tranſepts, are the oldeſt parts of the preſent building; but there is no part left at preſent that can boaſt of a remote date. All the labors of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and almoſt all of thoſe of its re-founder <hi>Hugh Lupus,</hi> are now loſt. The abbot, <hi>Simon Ripley,</hi> who was elected in 1485, finiſhed the middle aile and the tower. The body is ſupported by ſix ſharp-pointed arches. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns are thick, ſurrounded by pilaſters with ſmall rounded capitals. Above is a gallery, with a neat ſtone baluſtrade in the parts where it is entire, and a row of large and broad, pointed windows; which is the general ſtyle.</p>
               <p>THE preſent cathedral appears to have been built (excepting the ſlight fragments juſt mentioned) in the reigns of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. VII. and VIII; but principally in that of the two laſt. The beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful weſt-end was begun in 1508, and the firſt ſtone laid with much ceremony. The window over the door is filled with beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful tracery; and the door-caſe enriched with figures and other ſculpture. The deſcent into the church is down a multitude of ſteps; ſo there is reaſon to ſuſpect, that the preſent was on the foundation of the antient church; which had been on a level with the old ſtreets, which we know are many feet higher than they were originally, by the acceſſion of rubbiſh, and other adventitious matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0181900401:203"/>THE center beneath the great tower is greatly injured by a modern bell-loft, which conceals a crown-work of ſtone, that would have a good effect was the loft deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>FROM the ſprings of arches that appear in the walls of the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e and its ailes, it appears as if the architect had intended to have vaulted them, in the manner in which St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s chapel and the choiral ailes are done.</p>
               <p>THE choir is very neat; and the Gothic tabernacle-work over the ſtalls carved in a light and elegant manner. The arches in the galleries are divided by pretty ſlender pillars; and perhaps were of a date prior to the body of the church; probably the work of abbot <hi>Oldham,</hi> who was a benefactor, and had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in the building.</p>
               <p>IN the chancel are four ſtone-ſtalls for the officiating prieſts; with carved Gothic work above; a receſs or two for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving either the reliques or the ſacred utenſils. About the walls are diſperſed the monuments of ſeveral biſhops and church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but none of any magnificence; and one of Sir <hi>William Manwaring,</hi> a gallant young man, who ſell in the defence of the city during its long ſiege.</p>
               <p>THE biſhop's throne ſtands on a ſtone baſe, as remarkable for its ſculpture as its original uſe. Its form is an oblong ſquare; and each ſide moſt richly ornamented with Gothic carving, arches, and pinnacles. Around the upper part is a range of little images, deſigned to repreſent the kings and ſaints of the <hi>Mercian</hi> kingdom. Each held in one hand a ſcroll with the name inſcribed. Fanatic ignorance mutilated many of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, as well as the figures; but the laſt were reſtored about
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0181900401:204"/>
the year 1748; but the workman, by an unlucky miſtake, has placed female heads on male ſhoulders, and given manly faces to the bodies of the fair-ſex. At firſt, there were thirty-four figures: four are loſt; the remainder are faithfully deſcribed, and the hiſtory of each monarch and ſaint accurately given, in a little pamphlet, publiſhed in 1749, by the worthy Doctor <hi>William Cooper,</hi> who dedicated the profits for the uſe of the blue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat hoſpital in this city. I beg leave to diſſent from the notion of this having been the ſhrine of St. <hi>Werbugh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ST. WERBURCH'S SHRINE</note> as it is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularly called. It certainly was nothing more than the pedeſtal on which the real ſhrine, or, as the <hi>French</hi> call it, <hi>la chaſſe,</hi> ſtood, which contained the ſacred reliques. Theſe are made of gold, ſilver, vermeil, <hi>i. e,</hi> ſilver gilt, or ſome precious materials, and often enriched with gems of great value. They are of different forms, ſuch as churches, cabinets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and, ſhould the relique be a head, or limb, the <hi>chaſſe</hi> is made conformable to the ſhape of the part. Theſe are ſeated uſually conſpicuous on an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated place; and are always moveable, in order that they may be carried in proceſſion, either in honor of the ſaint, or to divert ſome great calamity. Thus, in 1180, the ſhrine of St. <hi>Werburgh</hi> was brought out to ſtop the rage of a fire in the city, which for a long time was invincible by every other means; but the approach of the holy remains inſtantly proved their ſanctity, by putting an end to its furious deſolation.</p>
               <p>BEFORE I take leave of this part of the church,<note place="margin">ASSASSINATION.</note> I muſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion an impious outrage committed at the high altar in 1492, by a gentleman of <hi>Wales,</hi> who wounded almoſt to death one <hi>Patrick Filling,</hi> I ſuppoſe the officiating prieſt. The church, as
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0181900401:205"/>
uſual, was immediately ſuſpended, till a luſtration in order to purify it from the foul ſtain was performed. The abby was reconciled on St. <hi>Werburgh</hi>'s day; the pariſh-church on that of St. <hi>Oſwald</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">King, ii. 189.</note>.</p>
               <p>AN impiety of this kind was committed in the church of <hi>Notre Dame</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> in 1670<note n="†" place="bottom">Felibica Hiſt. Paris, ii, 1500. Pieces Juſtif. iii. 212.</note>. The prieſt died of his wound; and expiation was made by order of the archbiſhop: public prayers were offered up for forty hours in all the churches; proceſſions made; a faſt of three days appointed. The whole terminated by a general (<hi>reparation</hi>) ſatisfaction of the injury by a grand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, in which the whole parlement aſſiſted. The ſtreets were covered with tapeſtry, and the avenues barred up with the chains to keep off the mob; and thus the place was reſtored to the diſcharge of the ſacred offices.</p>
               <p>IT is with a kind of horror I read in the zealous <hi>Fox,</hi> of an outrage of this ſort committed in our own kingdom, in the reign of queen <hi>Mary</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Martyrs., iii.</note>. The enthuſiaſt was taken, and puniſhed by the ſtriking off the criminal hand, and by being burnt: yet the hiſtorian gives him a place among the more well-meaning ſufferers of that barbarous period.</p>
               <p>BEHIND the choir is St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s chapel; and on each ſide is an aile. The monuments in theſe parts are in no wiſe remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. In its north-aile is a tomb with a flowery croſs, that of an abbot; and another of an altar-form, aſcribed to <hi>Henry</hi> IV. em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Germany,</hi> who, according to a legendary tale, was

               <p>The tranſepts are of unequal lengths. The north is very large. dedicated to St. <hi>Oſwald,</hi> and is the pariſh-church of that name. This is ſaid to have ſtood on the firſt church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul;</hi> which was afterwards changed to that of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> and finally, to the name it now bears. On the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building of the church, this aile was deſignedly enlarged, and allotted by the monks to the neighboring inhabitants, who were for the moſt part their ſervants or tenants. At firſt, the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious wiſhed to have the whole to themſelves, and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count built, at a diſtance from this aile, a chapel called St. <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s, and endowed it with a vicarage, for the uſe of the laity; but afterwards, at the requeſt. of the inhabitants, and by compoſition between the mayor and abbot, about the year 1488, they were reſtored to the uſe of the church of St. <hi>Oſwald,</hi> which they ſtill retain<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>King,</hi> ii. 39. 196.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE chapel falling into diſuſe, was purchaſed by the citizens, and converted into their common-hall for diſpatch of buſineſs<note n="‡" place="bottom">It is probable that there had been a more antient common-hall; a lane in this city ſtill retains the name of <hi>Old Common-hall lane.</hi>

               <p>THIS abby afforded only a temporary ſanctuary to the proſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate. The privelege which <hi>Hugh Lupus</hi> granted is particular: he ordered, that no thief or other malefactor, that attended the fair held at the feaſt of St. <hi>Werburgh,</hi> ſhould be attached, unleſs he committed ſome new offence there<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> 119.</note>. This, ſays <hi>King,</hi> drew a vaſt: concourſe of looſe people together at that ſeaſon, and proved of ſingular advantage to <hi>Randle the third,</hi> earl of <hi>Cheſter;</hi> who, in being ſurrounded in the caſtle of <hi>Rudland</hi> by a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous army of <hi>Welſh,</hi> and in great danger, ſent for relief to his general, <hi>Roger Lacy,</hi> at that time attending the midſummer-fair. <hi>Lacy</hi> inſtantly collected a body of minſtrels, fiddlers, and idle people, who were aſſembled here on account of this privelege; marched with them into <hi>Wales,</hi> and relieved the earl from his diſtreſs. <hi>Randle,</hi> on his return, immediately rewarded <hi>Lacy</hi> with a full power over all the inſtruments of his preſervation, <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterium omnium lecatorum et meretricam totius</hi> CESTRESHIRE. By this grant he was empowered to require the attendance of all the minſtrels and muſicians of the county on the anniverſary of the exploit. They were to play before him and his heirs for ever, in a proceſſion to the church of St. <hi>John;</hi> and, after divine ſervice, to the place where he kept his court. The minſtrels were there examined concerning their lives and converſation; whether any of them played without annual licence from their lord, or whether they had heard any words among their fellows
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0181900401:208"/>
tending to his diſhonor. Theſe priveleges were afterwards devolved by <hi>John,</hi> ſon of <hi>Roger de Lacy,</hi> to <hi>Hugh de Dutton</hi> and his heirs. The proceſſion and courts were held by their ſteward within my memory; but the cuſtom is now dropt.

               <p>ST. JOHN'S, when entire, was a magnificent pile. The tower once ſtood in the center; but falling down in 1574, was never rebuilt. The chancel was probably demoliſhed at the ſame time; but at that end are ſome fine arches, and other remains of antient chapels. Withinſide are curious ſpecimens of the clumſy ſtrength of <hi>Saxon</hi> architecture, in the maſſy columns and round arches which ſupport the body. The tower is now placed at the weſt-end; and has on one ſide the legend, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the figure of a man and a hind.</p>
               <p>ON the ſouth-ſide of the church-yard, impending over a high cliff, ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Radeclive</hi> of the Doomſday book, is a ſmall antient building, probably a chapel, called the <hi>Anchori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> placed over the retreat of ſome holy hermits. This might have been their place of ſepulture; for in the live rock were found two bodies depoſited in coffin-ſhaped cavities. This might have been the place, where legend ſays that <hi>Harold,</hi> the laſt <hi>Saxon</hi> king, ended his days; for it was long believed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that he eſcaped from the battle of <hi>Haſtings,</hi> and finiſhed his life in retirement.</p>
               <p>DOCTOR TANNER ſuppoſes, that the convent of <hi>Benedictine</hi> nuns, dedicated to St. <hi>Mary,</hi> originated either from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery

of St. <hi>John,</hi> or was a relique of one of the old nunneries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to St. <hi>Werburgh.</hi> This, perhaps, may have been the caſe; for, from a charter preſerved by <hi>Dugdale,</hi> it appears, that <hi>Ranale the ſecond,</hi> earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> had obtained <hi>for the nuns of</hi> Cheſter, certain crofts from <hi>Hugh Fitzoliver,</hi> for them to build a church and convent on; which implies that there had been nuns in the city previous to his grant<note n="*" place="bottom">Sciatis me dediſſe, et in perpetuam elemoſynam concepiſſe D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At that time <hi>Elizabeth Groſvenour</hi> was prioreſs, who made a ſurrender of the houſe, and had a penſion for life of twenty pounds; and eleven of the ſiſters had alſo penſions, from 4 <hi>l.</hi> to 1 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> each.

that the proportion of death among the inhabitants is only as one to thirty-one: whereas I am informed, by my worthy friend Doctor <hi>Haggarth</hi> of this city, that in <hi>Leeds,</hi> one in twenty-one; in <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Shrewſbury,</hi> one in twenty-ſix; and in <hi>London,</hi> one in twenty and three-fourths, annually pay the great tribute of nature.</p>

The <hi>Dee,</hi> after quitting the contracted paſs at the bridge, flows beneath an incurvated clayey cliff; and waſhes on the right a fine and extenſive meadow, long ſince protected againſt its ravages by a lofty dike. I imagine, that it lay open to the tides till about the year 1587, when the corporation (to whom it belongs) demiſed to one <hi>Thomas Lyneal,</hi> ſervant to Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham,</hi> this paſture for the term of twenty-one years, together with as much land as he could gain to it from the ſea.

From the hints dropt by <hi>Daniel King,</hi> I imagine them to have been of the ſame nature with thoſe practiſed by the young men of the metropolis, deſcribed by <hi>Fitz-Stephen,</hi> a writer cotemporary with <hi>Henry</hi> II. <q>The lay ſons of the citizens ruſh out of the gates in ſhoals, furniſhed with lances and ſhields; the younger ſort with javelins pointed, but diſarmed of their ſteel; they ape the feats of war, and act the ſham-fight. Part took the field well mounted. The generous courſers neigh and champ the bit. At length, when the courſe begins, and the youthful combatants are divided into claſſes or parties, one body retreats, and another purſues without being able to overtake them; while, in another quarter, the purſuers overtake the foe, unhorſe them, and paſs them many a length.

               <p>IN 1674,<note place="margin">New Cut.</note> ſome friend to the former prevaled on Mr. <hi>Andrew Yarranton,</hi> a gentleman extremely converſant in the commercial advantages of this iſland, to make a ſurvey of the river <hi>Dee</hi> and its eſtuary.

He alſo ſuggeſted the idea of a canal from the collieries at <hi>Aſton</hi> near <hi>Hawarden;</hi> which was to drop into this new channel, and facilitate the carriage of coal up to the city<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Andrew Yarranton's England</hi>'s Improvements by ſea and land, &amp;c. to, <hi>London,</hi> 1677.

Mr. <hi>Yarranton</hi>'s coal canal was to fall into the <hi>Dee</hi> near to <hi>Flint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AN act of parlement was obtained for the recovering and preſerving the navigation of the river, for ſettling the duties on ſhips, and for the eſtabliſhing two ferries for the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of travellers into the county of <hi>Flint.</hi> Other acts were paſſed in the years 1732, 1740, 43, 1752; and the works were begun with vigor. The project was carried on by ſubſcription; and the adventurers were to be rewarded by the lands they were empowered to gain on both ſides, from <q>the <hi>white ſands</hi> or the ſea from <hi>Cheſter;</hi> and between the county of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> on the north-ſide, and the county of <hi>Flint</hi> on the fouth-ſide; being ſands, ſoil, and ground not bearing graſs.</q> Party conteſts at firſt filled the ſubſcriptions: zeal for the houſe of <hi>Hanover</hi> was at that time mixed, in this city, with zeal for its commercial intereſt; but in a little time it was diſcovered to be the <hi>madneſs of many, but the gain of few.</hi> The expences proved enormous; multitudes were obliged to ſell out at above ninety <hi>per cent.</hi> loſs; and, their ſhares being bought by perſons of more wealth and foreſight, at length the plan was brought to a conſiderable degree of utility; and a ſine canal formed, guarded by vaſt banks, in which the river is conſined for the ſpace of ten miles; along which ſhips of three hundred and fifty tons burden may ſafely be brought up to the quays. Much land has been gained from the ſea; and good farms now appear in places not long ſince poſſeſſed by the unruly element.</p>
               <p>I REMEMBER an almoſt uſeleſs tide flowing about the water-tower,

the antient channel of the <hi>Dee</hi> flowing under <hi>Blacon</hi> point; and the acceſs to the county of <hi>Flint,</hi> on this ſide, open only at the receſs of tides, and annually occaſioning the loſs of multitudes of lives.

               <p>I SHALL now take a ſhort view of the trade of this city,<note place="margin">TRADE.</note> as it ſtood in the years 1771 and 1776. I bring the laſt into ſight, in order to ſhew how far this port has been affected by the commotions of our <hi>American</hi> ſubjects; and oppoſe it to the commerce of 1771, when it appears to have been in its meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, ſince the reſtoration of the channel. In that year were entered inwards</p>
               <p>297 coaſting-veſſels; 19 of which were laden with groceries, and other goods from <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>526 coaſt ſhips outwards; of theſe 23 came from the port of <hi>London,</hi> and were laden here with lead, iron cannon, two thouſand tons of cheeſe, and other goods.</p>
               <p>IN the ſame year, 95 veſſels were entered inwards from foreign parts; and 216 entered inwards from <hi>Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy,</hi> and <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM <hi>Norway</hi> and the <hi>Baltic,</hi> are imported timber, flax, tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, hemp, iron, and deals.</p>
               <p>FROM <hi>Leghorn,</hi> large quantities of kid and lamb ſkins; which are manufactured by the glovers, after being dreſſed here.

This, in fact, is the only manufacture which the city can boaſt of. I find, that in the reigns of queen <hi>Elizabeth, James</hi> I. and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that of <hi>Charles</hi> I. here was a vaſt trade in calves ſkins. In the firſt of thoſe monopolizing times, the queen grants one <hi>Arthur Balſano</hi> a licence to export 6000 dickers of leather of calves ſkins, ten dozens to every dicker, for ſeven years, paying five ſhillings <hi>per</hi> dicker. <hi>James</hi> I. granted to <hi>James Maxwel</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a licence to export 18,000 dickers, for the ſame duty, and for twenty-one years; and this was afterwards confirmed to him by <hi>Charles</hi> I<note n="*" place="bottom">

This <hi>Maxwel</hi> was one of the grooms of the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber to his majeſty; and in the preceding reign, by a piece of inſolence to a gentleman of the inns of court, brought on him the reſentment of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and was obliged to atone for it by making due ſubmiſſion. The firſt grant might be made to him by <hi>James,</hi> to make amends for the mortifications he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone.</p>
               <p>FROM <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> are imported great quantities of cork, fruit, oil of olives, nuts, <hi>Barilla</hi> aſhes, and raiſins; and ſeveral hundred tons of wine from <hi>Portugal;</hi> which laſt form the greateſt foreign import of this city.</p>
               <p>WHILE the trade with <hi>America</hi> was open, fiſh and oil were brought from <hi>Newfoundland;</hi> and a ſmall trade was carried on with <hi>Caroling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE exports this year were upwards of 6000 chaldrons of coal from the <hi>Cheſhire</hi> and <hi>Flintſhire</hi> collieries (which lie within this port); 1000 tons of lead; 300 of lead ore; 300 of oak

               <p>IN return, it imports from <hi>Ireland,</hi> at the <hi>Midſummer</hi> and <hi>Michaelmas</hi> fairs, upwards of 1000 boxes and packs of linen cloth, containing 25,000 pieces at leſt: beſides 300 boxes or packs imported into <hi>Leverpool,</hi> and ſent acroſs the <hi>Merſey</hi> to <hi>Ince,</hi> from whence they are conveyed in carts to <hi>Cheſter.</hi> Theſe form all together a million of yards each fair. This trade began no longer ago than the year 1736, in which 449, 654. yards were imported. The importations continually increaſed till the laſt year of the late war; from which period it has been on a par.</p>
               <p>IRELAND alſo ſends conſiderable quantities of lamb-ſkins, wool, linen and bay-yarn, tallow, hides, butter, feathers, and quills, ox bones and hoofs, glue, ſheep and cat guts; calve-velves, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and live cattle.</p>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0181900401:223"/>
with great ſpirit a few years ago. It was to run through the county beneath <hi>Beeſton</hi> caſtle, and to terminate near <hi>Middlewich.</hi> Another branch was to extend to <hi>Namptwich.</hi> One mouth opens into the <hi>Dee,</hi> below the water-tower. A fine baſon is formed, into which the boats are to deſcend, by means of five ſucceſſive locks, beneath the northern walls of the city, cut in the live rock. A few miles of this deſign are completed: but, by an unhappy miſcalculation of expence, and by unforeſeen difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties occurring in the execution, ſuch enormous charges were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, as to put a ſtop for the preſent to all proceedings. The other branch, which was to extend towards <hi>Middlewich,</hi> was to end within a limited diſtance from the great canal between the <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Merſey</hi> navigation. The great objects were the ſalt and cheeſe trade; and coal for the ſupply of the interior parts of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> from the vaſt collieries in <hi>Staffordſhire.</hi> Share alſo in the exportation of hard-ware, earthen-ware, and all the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of the internal part of the kingdom within its reach, might have been reaſonably expected.</p>
               <p>THE idea of a canal along the dead flat between <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Ince</hi> has been long ſince conceived, by perſons very converſant in the nature of the trade of this city. One mouth might have opened into the <hi>Dee</hi> in the place of the preſent; another near <hi>Ince,</hi> which would create a ready intercourſe with <hi>Leverpool,</hi> the <hi>Weever,</hi> and the ſalt-works and great dairies on that river; with <hi>Warrington,</hi> and with the flouriſhing town of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and a numerous ſet of places within reach of the <hi>Merſey,</hi> and of the canal belonging to that uſeful Peer, the duke of <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> to which the greateſt of our inland navigations is connected.

               <p>ON leaving the city, I repaſſed <hi>Hanbridge;</hi> and at the may pole took the left-hand road, which is a continuation of the <hi>Roman</hi> road from the river.

It points towards <hi>Eccleſton,</hi> near which are the reliques of a mount; the ſite, perhaps, of a ſmall caſtlet.

               </p>
               <p>IN 1643, <hi>Holt Caſtle</hi> was in the hands of the crown; but in that year was feized for the uſe of the parlement, by Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Brereton</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Middhton</hi>

               <p>THE lordſhip is at preſent in the crown, under the direction of the ſteward of <hi>Bromfield</hi> and <hi>Yale;</hi> an office in his majeſty's diſpoſal: but a grant of the minerals (the far more valuable part) was made to the <hi>Groſvenour</hi> family in the reign of <hi>Charles</hi> I. ſubject to the annual payment of twenty ſhillings. An attempt was made by king <hi>William</hi> to alienate theſe important do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in favor of the earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> and his heirs for ever; but on a vigorous repreſentation of the illegality, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly on the noble ſpeech<note n="‖" place="bottom">

The whole rents at that time reſulting to the crown, amounted only to a thouſand a year, beſides miſes, reliefs, and other contingent profits.

the prince on his acceſſion, in old times, in cattle; but after its conqueſt, changed into money. It amounted to about five thouſand pounds. It was payed thrice in the time of <hi>James</hi> I, firſt, at his coming to the crown; ſecondly, on the creation of his ſon <hi>Henry</hi> prince of <hi>Wales;</hi> thirdly, on the creation of <hi>Charles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ON leaving <hi>Holt,</hi> I returned over the bridge; and, paſſing along a portion of CHESHIRE, in a flat country, with a pleaſing view of the <hi>Broxton</hi> hills on the left, I reached the ſite of <hi>Shocklach</hi> caſtle. This, with great part of the antient hundred of <hi>Dudeſtan,</hi> was held after the Conqueſt by <hi>Robert Fitzbugh,</hi> from <hi>Hugh Lupus.</hi> It belonged to the barony of Malpas; but on the diviſion of it, one part came to <hi>John de Sutton</hi> baron of Dudley, the other to <hi>Urien de Sancto Petro.</hi> What is remarkable, it was held of queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as of her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Eaſt Greenwich.</hi> Nothing, excepting a foſs, marks the place of this fortreſs. On the oppoſite ſide of the road is a vaſt mount, probably of far greater antiquity than the caſtle; and explora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, commanding a great view around. By the name of <hi>Stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> a neighboring place, I conjecture that a <hi>Roman</hi> road went this way; but my time did not permit me to ſearch after it.</p>
               <p>AT a ſmall diſtance from <hi>Shocklach</hi> caſtle, I entered <hi>Maelor Saeſneg,</hi> a hundred of FLINTSHIRE, disjoined from the reſt of the county. At the time of the making of the, Doomſday book, the lands about <hi>Worthenbury, Overton,</hi>

               <p>IN 1177, it was transferred to a prince of <hi>North Wales.

This the politic monarch did, in hopes of retaining the affections of <hi>David,</hi> and to prevent a breach with the <hi>Welſh;</hi> who gave him ſuch great diſturbance, and ſo often baffled his greateſt endeavors to ſubdue them during the reign of <hi>Owen Gwynedd</hi> father to <hi>David.</hi> This alliance anſwered his purpoſe; for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> remained unmoleſted during the life of that prince.</p>
               <p>AFTER his deceaſe, <hi>Robert Lupus</hi> held, by his bailiff, this manor.</p>
               <p>AFTER this, it came a ſecond time into the hands of a prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> King <hi>John,</hi> by grant dated from <hi>Dover, April</hi> 16th 1204, beſtowed it, with <hi>Joan,</hi> his natural child by <hi>Agatha</hi> daughter of <hi>Robert Ferrers</hi> earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> on <hi>Llewelyn ap Jorwerth.</hi> It is probable that <hi>John</hi> hoped, by means of his ſon-in-law, to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0181900401:262"/>
the lord marchers into obedience: but the unfortunate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch reaped no benefit from the alliance. <hi>Joan</hi> proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to our prince's bed; who hanged <hi>William de Breos,</hi> author of his diſgrace, and turned his arms againſt the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> This induced <hi>John</hi> to diveſt <hi>Llewelyn</hi> of the government of ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a fortreſs as a frontier caſtle; for, by a writ dated from <hi>Warwick,</hi> in the tenth year of his reign, he orders the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, <hi>Bartholomew Turol,</hi> to deliver it inſtantly to <hi>William</hi> earl of <hi>Saluſbury</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Endinton.</hi> But ſtill left the revenues of the lands to his daughter.</p>
               <p>IN the fourth or <hi>Henry</hi> III. or the year 1219, <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange</hi> yielded to the king the manors of <hi>Colmere</hi> and <hi>Hampton;</hi> but received them again, together with the hundred of <hi>Elleſmere</hi> and its caſtle; but for life only.</p>
               <p>In 1236, or the 21ſt of the ſame monarch, it appears that <hi>John L'Eſtrange</hi> was governor of the caſtle. Four years after this, <hi>Henry</hi> determined no longer to leave a place of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence in the hands of the <hi>Welſh.</hi> Accordingly, we find him obliging <hi>David ap Llewelyn</hi> to make a formal renunciation of this territory, which he cedes for ever. The treaty was dated from <hi>Alnet</hi> on the <hi>Elwy,</hi> on the feaſt of the decollation of St. <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> in 1240.</p>
               <p>IN 1252, the 37th of <hi>Henry</hi> III. the manor and caſtle of <hi>Ellſmere</hi> were committed to <hi>John de Grey,</hi> paying an annual fine of ten ſhillings.</p>
               <p>IN the 43d year, or 1258, <hi>Peter de Montfort</hi> was governor of the caſtle. In the 51ſt, the manor, caſtle, and hundred were granted to <hi>Hamon L'Eſtrange</hi> and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The houſe is ſituated on an elevated plot of ground, which riſes out of an extenſive flat, great part of which was ſubject to frequent floods; an inconvenience which has ſince been removed by the preſent owner, at the expence of much trouble and money, in draining conſiderable tracts of low ground; whereby the neighborhood is rendered more healthy and pleaſant. This flat, being well dotted with trees, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably foreſhortens the proſpect, till it is bounded by the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent ſcenery of the ſurrounding hills, which diſtinctly form, in various ſhapes, many pleaſing points of view. A very extenſive wood flanks each ſide of the houſe, which is bounded by a fine piece of water, made by extending the banks of the river <hi>Perry,</hi> and by conveying a branch of it through the lower parts of the wood, incloſing ſeveral iſlands, whoſe ſhores are ſhaded by very large full-grown oaks; which all together forms one of the moſt pleaſing artificial pieces of water that is to be met with. The reſt of the grounds are watered with the river <hi>Perry;</hi> a ſtream which uſed to abound with excellent pike, perch, trout, dace, gudgeons, cray-fiſh, and eels, till modern luxury gave an additional ſpur to the dexterity of poachers; a grievance complained of, though encouraged, in this as well as in moſt rivers in the kingdom.

THE ſucceeding <hi>Fulk</hi> did not degenerate from his anceſtors.

               <p>IT appears that he did not neglect, in the following reign, to obtain a confirmation of theſe eſtates, and to ſecure them to all poſterity. He obtained in 1219 from <hi>Henry</hi> III. a grant of <hi>Whittington</hi> to him and his heirs; for which he gave the king two hundred and ſixty-two pounds, and two courſers.

theſe marches, inured to war by their frequent conflicts with the <hi>Welſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IMMEDIATELY on the defeat, the rebel victor, <hi>Montfort</hi> earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> appointed <hi>Peter de Montfort,</hi> a creature of his own, governor of this caſtle; and ſoon after, making uſe of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive monarch's power againſt himſelf, obliged him<note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer, i. 814.</note> to reſign to <hi>Llewelyn ap Gryffydd</hi> prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> the hundred of <hi>Elleſmere,</hi> ſeveral of the border caſtles, and among others that of <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington</hi> and its appertenances.

               </p>
               <p>IN 1281, <hi>Fulk</hi> attended <hi>Edward</hi> I. in his expedition againſt the <hi>Welſh;</hi> and was rewarded by the grant of free-warren on his lands in this manor.</p>
               <p>IN 1300, he had a feud with his potent neighbor <hi>Richard</hi> earl of <hi>Arundel;</hi> but it was prevented by the interference of the king.</p>
               <p>HE died in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> II. His ſon was at that time in <hi>France,</hi> in his majeſty's ſervice; whoſe lady, <hi>Alionora,</hi> had livery of the manor till her huſband could return to do homage.</p>
               <p>IN 1329, or the 3d of <hi>Edward</hi> III. the new earl was accuſed by <hi>Edmund</hi> earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> uncle to the king, of raiſing ſeditious

               <p>IN the inſurrection of <hi>Owen Glyndwr,</hi> the vaſſals favored his cauſe: but their lord obtained a pardon for them from <hi>Henry</hi> IV.</p>

               <p>THE caſtle ſtands on a flat: the gateway,<note place="margin">CASTLE.</note> and the ruins of two vaſt round towers, with cruciform ſlips by way of windows, ſtill remain; and the bare veſtiges of two others may yet be traced. It had been ſurrounded by a moat, and ſeveral vaſt ditches, which comprehended ſeveral other works. The moat was filled by a rivulet that riſes near <hi>Pentre Pant,</hi> in the pariſh of <hi>Sela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn.</hi> On entering this pariſh, it is loſt for near a mile, and emerges in the fields on the back of the caſtle.</p>

IT is probable, that this was a place of defence from the time of its earlieſt poſſeſſors. No place on the borders of unfriendly nations could poſſibly remain unfortified; but the architect of the caſtle whoſe ruins we now contemplate, was certainly the great <hi>Fitz-warine,</hi> granſon of Guarine, founder of the family. Theſe were among the greateſt of the barons called <hi>Lord marchers of Wales;</hi> of whoſe origin an ample account will be given in the appendix.</p>
               <p>THE ſteward of the manor holds annually a court-leet and court-baron in a room in the caſtle;<note place="margin">STEWARD.</note> to which the inhabitants are ſummoned, and fined one penny each for non-attendance. Chief-rents are payed to the lord; and a heriot of the beſt beaſt is clamed at the death of moſt of the freeholders within the lordſhip.</p>
               <p>THE church,<note place="margin">CHURCH.</note> dedicated to St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> is a rectory, valued in the king's books at 25 <hi>l.</hi> 4 <hi>s.</hi> It is a ſmall building, ſuppoſed to have been originally deſigned as the chapel to the caſtle, and made out of the refuſe materials of that fortreſs by its founder. According to the tradition of the place, he was buried in the porch, it being an act of devotion, in thoſe days, for all perſons, on their entrance into churches or religious houſes, to pray for the ſouls of the founders and benefactors. <hi>Fulk Fitz-warine,</hi> ſeventh of the name, who had the greateſt revenue of any of the family, by will, dated the 15th of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> II. directed that his body ſhould be buried in the chancel. The largeſt part of his eſtates were in other counties; but he gave this place the preference, as the antient ſeat of the family.</p>

               <p>IT is obſervable, that in all parts the ditch is on the <hi>Welſh</hi> ſide; and that there are numbers of ſmall artificial mounts, the ſites of ſmall forts, in many places along its courſe.

In the end he was condemned to loſe his head; for which, with a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous intrepidity, he made the court a low reverence, and gave his humble thanks. A by-ſtander aſked what he meant: he replied aloud, <q>It was a great honour to a poor gentleman of <hi>Wales</hi> to loſe his head with ſuch noble lords; for by G—, he was afraid they would have hanged him.</q>

It conſiſts of five arches; whoſe wideſt does not exceed twenty-eight feet in diameter.

               <p>As a contraſt to this excellent performance of Mr. <hi>Nollikin,</hi> is placed againſt the wall a great monument of <hi>Henry Wynn</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> tenth ſon of Sir <hi>John Wynn</hi> of <hi>Gwydir,</hi> who died in 1671.

moſtly flat and wooded. This <hi>Caer</hi> contains about four acres of ground, protected in ſome parts by one, in others with two very ſtrong dikes and deep ditches. The inner dike is made of looſe ſtones, with a wall of vaſt thickneſs on the top. Within the area are many veſtiges of buildings, the habitations of the old poſſeſſors.

He came on a preſſing invitation from <hi>Owen;</hi> who, knowing the mighty influence of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of men over the antient <hi>Britons,</hi> made his houſe, as <hi>Jolo</hi> ſays, a ſanctuary for bards. He made them the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his future operations, and to prepare the minds of the people againſt the time of his intended inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. From <hi>Jolo</hi> I borrow the deſcription of the ſeat of the chieftain, when it was in full ſplendor. He compares it, in point of magnificence, to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> abby; and informs us, that it had a gate-houſe, and was ſurrounded with a moat.</p>
               <p>THAT within were nine halls, each furniſhed with a ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe; I imagine, filled with the cloaths of his retainers, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtom of thoſe days.</p>
               <p>NEAR the houſe, on a verdant bank, was a wooden houſe, ſupported on poſts, and covered with tiles. It contained four apartments, each ſubdivided into two, deſigned to lodge the gueſts.</p>
               <p>HERE was a church in form of a croſs, with ſeveral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels.</p>
               <p>THE ſeat was ſurrounded with every conveniency for good living; and every ſupport to hoſpitality: a park, warren, and pigeon-houſe; a mill, orchard, and vineyard; and fiſh-pond, filled with pike and gwyniads. The laſt introduced from the lake at <hi>Bala.</hi>

               <p>A PLACE ſtill remains, that retains the name of his park. It extends about a mile or two beyond the ſite of his houſe, on the left-hand of the valley.</p>
               <p>THE veſtiges of the houſe are ſmall. The moat is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent: the meaſurement of the area it incloſed, is forty-ſix paces by twenty-ſix. There is the appearance of a wall on the outſide, which was continued to the top of a great mount, on which ſtood the wooden houſe. On the other ſide, but at a greater diſtance, I had paſſed by another mount of the ſame kind, called <hi>Hêndom;</hi> which probably might have had formerly a building ſimilar to that deſcribed by the bard. This, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, was the ſtation of a guard, to prevent ſurprize or inſult from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſide.

               </p>
               <p>THE bard ſpeaks feelingly of the wine, the ale, the braget, and the white bread; nor does he forget the kitchen, nor the important officer the cook; whoſe life (when in the royal ſervice) was eſtimated by our laws at a hundred and twenty-ſix cows <note n="*" place="bottom">Leges Wallicae.</note>.

               <p>SUCH was the ſtate of the domeſtic affairs of <hi>Glyndwr</hi> at the change of government in 1399. His reſentment againſt the uſurper was whetted by wrongs public and private: by the murder of the unhappy <hi>Richard,</hi> to whom he was ſtrongly attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by being a perſonal favorite; and by the ſtrong partiality the <hi>Welſh</hi> had for their late king.</p>
               <p>IN the very firſt year or the new reign, he experienced the frowns of the court.<note place="margin">OPPRESSED BY LORD GREY.</note> 
                  <hi>Reginald</hi> lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Ruthyn,</hi> taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the depoſal of <hi>Richard,</hi> inſtantly ſeized on a certain common, called <hi>Croeſeu,</hi> which <hi>Glyndwr,</hi> in a former reign, had recovered from him by courſe of law. <hi>Owen</hi> fought juſtice without having recourſe to violence: he laid his caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore parlement; but his ſuit was diſmiſſed without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs.</p>
               <p>THIS inſult was aggravated by another injury. When <hi>Henry</hi> went on his expedition againſt the <hi>Scots, Owen</hi> was to have been ſummoned, among other barons, to attend the king with his vaſſals. The writ for that purpoſe was delivered to <hi>Reginald</hi>

               <p>THE danger of driving into deſperate meaſures a perſon of his intereſt, ſpirit, and abilities, was foreſeen by <hi>John Trevor</hi> biſhop of St. <hi>Aſaph,</hi> who adviſed more temperate proceedings; that <hi>Owen</hi> was by no means a deſpicable enemy; and that the <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IT does not appear that <hi>Glyndwr,</hi> till this period, had any ſettled deſign of flinging off the <hi>Engliſh</hi> yoke.

               <p>CHARLES VI. of <hi>France,</hi> father-in-law to the unhappy <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> prepared to revenge his depoſal and murder.

               <p>THE <hi>Scots</hi> taking advantage of his ſituation, threatened him with invaſion.

               <p>LORD GREY was the firſt that felt the effects of <hi>Owen's</hi> power.

               <p>LORD GREY remained for a long time in captivity,<note place="margin">MAKES HIM PAY A GREAT RANSOM</note> nor did he gain his liberty till he paid to him the vaſt ſum of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand marks.

               <p>THE <hi>Scots,</hi> at this time, took advantage of the commotions of the <hi>Welſh;</hi> and, under the command of the great <hi>Douglas,</hi> invaded <hi>England</hi> with a body of twelve or thirteen thouſand men.

               <p>THE poet, on this occaſion, plays finely with the warmth of <hi>Glyndwr;</hi> and draws from him that characteriſtic ſpirit of our country, which is nobly prompt to riſe on the appearance, or ſometimes even on the very apprehenſion of inſult.</p>
               <p>HENRY quickly received news from the north, that ſerved to alleviate the ill ſucceſs of his invaſion. The earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> and other northern barons, had aſſembled their forces to oppoſe the <hi>Scots,</hi> then on their return home; overtook them on <hi>Holyrood</hi>-day, or the 15th of <hi>September,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">BATTLE OF HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MELDON:</note> on <hi>Homeldon</hi> hill near <hi>Wooler,</hi> and gained over them a complete victory.

               <p>THIS battle was productive of great events; and proved in the end the deſtruction of the <hi>Percy</hi> family. It was uſual for the priſoners to fall to the ſhare of the victors; and that each perſon who was fortunate or brave enough to make a captive, ſhould receive the reward of his valor, by having liberty to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom him, according to his rank or abilities.<note place="margin">ITS CONSE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUENCES.</note> 
                  <hi>Henry Percy</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Hotſpur,</hi> had himſelf, by the fortune of war, been made

The victors at this time expected and clamed the ſame right; but <hi>Henry,</hi> wiſhing to detain, as hoſtages for the peaceable conduct of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> nation, theſe illuſtrious captives, ſent directions to the earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> that he ſhould by no means ſet them at liberty; but that he ſhould deliver them to him. <hi>Henry</hi> ſoftened this demand by rewarding <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with a conſiderable grant of lands on the borders of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer, viii. 289.</note>; and parlement even ſent him a letter of thanks for his good ſervices.<note place="margin">THE PERCIES DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CONTENTED;</note> Notwithſtanding this, the <hi>Percies</hi> were greatly diſſatisfied. Whether their high ſpirit reſented the invaſion of the antient title of victors to their priſoners; or whether they were ſeized with remorſe for their diſloyalty to their former maſter; or whether they were actuated by the ambition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming independent; or whether all theſe cauſes might not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate, is not very certain; yet, from this time, they formed their deſign of flinging off their allegiance to <hi>Henry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A GREAT diſcontent with his government at this period began to ſeize the nation. The affection for the murdered <hi>Richard</hi> revived.

               <p>OWEN opened the campaign of this year with vigor. He laid waſte the country of his enemies; took ſeveral caſtles,<note place="margin">GLYNDWR RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEATS BEFORE THE ENGLISH:</note> among others, thoſe of <hi>Harlech</hi> and <hi>Aheryſtwyth.</hi> Some he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled, and others he reſerved, and garriſoned.

               <p>THE <hi>Engliſh</hi> hiſtorians mention the defeat of <hi>Glyndwr.</hi> They inform us, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> army was commanded by <hi>Richard Beauchamp</hi> earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who took the banner of <hi>Glyndwr</hi>

               <p>THIS year opened with an attempt of a very extraordinary nature; nothing leſs than to free from their confinement the young earl of <hi>March</hi> and his brother,<note place="margin">ATTEMPTS TO STEAL AWAY THE EARE OF MARCH.</note> with the intent of ſetting up the title of the firſt firſt that of <hi>Henry,</hi> and to involve the whole kingdom in his quarrel. There were many engaged in the deſign. <hi>Wales</hi> was to have been his aſylum, and <hi>Glyndwr</hi> his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector: ſuch deep intelligence had he with the diſſaffected, even near the ſeat of the court. <hi>March</hi> was kept in cloſe cuſtody at <hi>Windſor,</hi> a royal reſidence, amidſt guards, and ſecured by every precaution that a jealous uſurper could invent.

A ſeverer fate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the poor ſmith that made the keys, who was beheaded, after having both his hands chopped off<note n="*" place="bottom">Holinſhed, 527.</note>.</p>
               <p>FORTUNE now began to frown upon <hi>Glyndwr.</hi> The firſt experience he had of her mutability was on the 11th of <hi>March:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">BATTLE OF USKE;</note> a body of his partizans, to the amount of eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, had aſſembled out of <hi>Glamorganſhire, Uſke, Netherwent,</hi> and <hi>Overwent.</hi> As uſual, they began their march with deſolat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the country; and burnt part of the town of <hi>Groſmont,</hi> in the county of <hi>Monmouth. Henry</hi> prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was at that time at <hi>Hereſord,</hi> with the army entruſted to him by his father,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0181900401:382"/>
ready to open the campaign. He there received an account of the defeat of theſe malecontents, by a handful of men commanded by Sir <hi>Gilbert Talbot,</hi> joined by Sir <hi>William Newport</hi> and Sir <hi>John Greindre.</hi> He tranſmitted the account to his father, in a letter written in an uncommon ſtrain of piety and dutifulneſs, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to the popular opinion of his early licentiouſneſs; for at that time he was only ſeventeen years of age. He begins with imploring Heaven for its favor towards his father: <hi>Je ſupplie vraiement que</hi> DIEU <hi>vous montre graciouſment pour vous ſon miracle on toutes parties, loez ſoit il en toutes ſes ocures.—Il eſt bien voirs, que la victoire n'eſt pas en le multitude de people mes en la puiſſance de</hi> DIEU.</p>
               <p>IT ſeems that the <hi>Welſh</hi> forgot the antient ſpirit of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and yielded an eaſy victory to the enemy. Eight hundred or a thouſand were ſtain. No quarter was given on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, except to one perſon, <hi>un grant chiefteyn entre eulx.</hi> The humanity of young <hi>Henry</hi> appears to great advantage on this affair. He tells his father, that he would have ſent the priſoner to him, but that he could not yet ride with any eaſe (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on account of his wounds) <hi>mes il ne poet chivacher uncore a ſon aiſe</hi>

               <p>To repair this diſaſter, <hi>Glyndwr</hi> inſtantly ſent one of his ſons with another army. They probably were reinforced by the fugitives from the laſt action.<note place="margin">OF PWLL MELYN.</note> Another battle was fought on the fifteenth of the ſame month, at <hi>Mynydd y Pwll Melyn</hi> in <hi>Brecknockſhire,</hi> again fatal to the cauſe of <hi>Owen.</hi> Fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

of his men were ſlain or taken priſoners: among the laſt was his ſon; among the firſt his brother <hi>Tudor,</hi> who reſembled <hi>Glyndwr</hi> ſo greatly, that a report was ſpread of his death, to the great dejection of his countrymen: but, on examining the dead body, it was found to want a wart over the eye, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed our chieftain from his brother. According to <hi>Carte</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">ii. 665.</note>, young <hi>Henry</hi> commanded at this battle.</p>
               <p>HOLINSHED<note n="†" place="bottom">528.</note> mentions another defeat which the <hi>Welſh</hi> ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the month of <hi>May,</hi> in which <hi>Gryffydd Yonge, Owen'</hi>'s chancellor, was made priſoner. I ſuſpect that the hiſtorian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds this action with that near <hi>Groſmont;</hi> but that the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor was the great chieftain there made priſoner, muſt be a miſtake; for we find him witneſs, the next year, to a pardon granted by <hi>Owen</hi> to one <hi>Jeven Gôch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AFTER theſe defeats, all <hi>Glamorganſhire</hi> ſubmitted to the king, a few faithful friends only excepted; who, on diſcovering that <hi>Owen</hi> was alive, fled and joined him. It was at this time that he ſuffered thoſe diſtreſſes which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> attribute to the latter part of his life. During this diſperſion of his friends, he was obliged to ſeek protection from a few truſty partizans; and often to conceal himſelf in caves and deſert places. A cavern near the ſea-ſide, in the pariſh of <hi>Llangelynin,</hi> in the county of <hi>Merioneth,</hi> is ſtill called <hi>Ogof Owain,</hi> in which he was ſecretly ſupported by <hi>Ednyfed ap Aaron,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Ednowain ap Bradwen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE bard <hi>Jolo Gôch</hi> deplores his abſence; and calls him home from different parts of the globe, to re-poſſeſs himſelf of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0181900401:384"/>
his principality. He in one place ſuppoſes him to be at <hi>Rome,</hi> and entreats him to return laden with tokens from St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ABOUT this time the earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> began another conſpiracy; which was detected, and ſeveral of his adherents were executed. Among others, one Sir <hi>John Griffith,</hi> a <hi>Welſh</hi> knight; which makes it probable, that the earl and <hi>Glyndwr</hi> ſtill acted in concert. The king, by his activity, quickly fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated this plot; ſeized on the earl's caſtles, and obliged him to fly into <hi>Scotland</hi> for protection. With him fled the biſhops of St. <hi>Aſaph</hi> and <hi>Bangor</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Ferdun. Scotichronicon. ii, 441.</note>, and the abbot of <hi>Welbeck.</hi> The two firſt were probably placed by <hi>Glyndwr</hi> about the earl, to conſult the proper meaſures for the ſucceſsful execution of their deſigns.</p>
               <p>HENRY then returned,<note place="margin">HENRY MARCHRS AGAIN INTO WALES</note> and marched into <hi>Wales</hi> with an army of 37,000 men.

               <p>FROM this period <hi>Owen</hi> never made any attempts worthy of hiſtoric notice. Numbers of his followers deſerted; which obliged him to confine himſelf to the hills, and to act entirely on the defenſive. Notwithſtanding his power was reduced, he was far from being ſubdued.

The ſides conſiſt of three horizontal beams, with upright planks, not four inches aſunder, mortiſed into them. In theſe are grooves with holes in the bottom, as if there had been originally croſs-bars, or grates. The roof is exceedingly ſtrong, compoſed of ſtrong planks almoſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous. It ſeems as if there had been two ſtories; but the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part at preſent is evidently modern.</p>
               <p>IT is ſingular, that the government did not take advantage of two <hi>Welſhmen</hi> of rank, whom they had this year in their power, and whom they might have made the price of the liberty of their partizan. Theſe were <hi>Rhys ap Tudur</hi> of <hi>Penmynydd</hi> in <hi>Angle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea,</hi> and his brother. Perhaps they were taken after the treaty had its effect; perhaps their crimes were too enormous for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: but whatſoever the caſe was, they were both conveyed to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and there put to death.</p>
               <p>I MUST not omit, that in 1410, <hi>Henry</hi> prince of <hi>Wales</hi> gave a free pardon to certain of his tenants in the comot of <hi>Coleſhill,</hi> in the county of <hi>Flint</hi>

                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:0181900401:402"/>THIS was the laſt of the many laws enacted againſt the <hi>Welſh</hi> on occaſion of this inſurrection.<note place="margin">SEVERE LAWS.</note> They were certainly very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere; yet, perhaps, no more than what any government would have directed, againſt a people that had ſubmitted to conqueſt near a hundred and twenty years, and who were conſidered in no other light than that of rebellious ſubjects.</p>
               <p>ON the firſt inſurrection, conciliatory methods were tried, and pardons offered. After experience of the little effect theſe had on the minds of the <hi>Welſh,</hi> every lenient ſtep was laid aſide, and laws of a very ſevere nature were put in force againſt them.</p>
               <p>THE firſt was in the year 1400. It was found expedient to prevent, as much as poſſible, all intercourſe between the <hi>Welſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The firſt were ſtrongly attached to the cauſe of <hi>Richard;</hi> the laſt had many ſecret favorers of that unhappy prince among them. There appeared much danger, if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer were permitted to ſtrengthen their intereſt in <hi>England:</hi> a coalition fatal to the new government was apprehended. As a preventative, it was enacted: That no perſon born on both ſides of <hi>Welſh</hi> parents ſhould purchaſe lands or tenements near any of the cities or towns on the marches of <hi>Wales,</hi> on pain of forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the lord paramount where ſuch eſtates lay: That no <hi>Welſhman</hi> ſhould be received into any corporation town; or, if they had been ſettled in any ſuch before, they were to find ſecurity for their good and loyal behaviour; they were to be totally diſquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from any civil office, and never allowed to carry any weapons.</p>
               <p>IN caſe any <hi>Welſhman</hi> refuſed to reſtore to any <hi>Engliſhman</hi> the cattle, horſes, or the like, (which he had forcibly taken) within ſeven days, the <hi>Engliſhman</hi> was allowed to retaliate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:0181900401:403"/>So little truſt was there in juſtice from our countrymen, that it was enacted, that no <hi>Engliſhman</hi> ſhould be condemned at the ſuit of a

               <p>So greatly did the government apprehend the ſeduction of <hi>Engliſh</hi> loyalty by the charms of our countrywomen, that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> were prohibited from marrying with a <hi>Welſhwoman,</hi> under the pain of being diſqualified from holding any office in <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN 1402, there is a very particular ſtatute, intended to remedy the miſchiefs reſulting from ſome cuſtoms peculiar to <hi>Wales.</hi> This directs,<note place="margin">KYMHORTHA.</note> that <hi>nul weſtour, rymour, minſtrall, ne vagabond, ſoit aucunement ſuſtenuz en la terre de</hi> Gales, <hi>par faire kymorthas ou coillage ſur le commune poeple illoeqes.</hi> I cannot give a better tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, than that in the obſervations on the antient ſtatutes, by my eſteemed friend the honorable DAINES BARRINGTON; which is to this purpoſe: THAT no hoſt<note n="*" place="bottom">I beg leave to render the word <hi>weſtour</hi> differently: it ſeems derived from the <hi>Welſh, gweſtwr,</hi> which ſignifies a perſon who kept a place of public entertainment; and ſuch a place was very proper for a rendezvous of this nature.</note>, rhymer, minſtrel, or other vagabond, ſhould preſume to aſſemble or collect together.</p>
               <p>THE word <hi>kymhortha</hi> is miſ-ſpelt from the <hi>Welſh cymmorth,</hi> or the plural <hi>cymmorthau,</hi> aſſemblies of people to aſſiſt a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in any work. Such are very frequently in uſe at preſent. There are <hi>cymmorthan</hi> for ſpinning; for works of huſbandry; for coal-carriage. But at this time, theſe meetings were mere pretences; and their end was the collecting a ſufficient number
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0181900401:404"/>
of able-bodied men to make an inſurrection. Of ſuch a nature, in old times, were the hunting-matches in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in that part of <hi>Great Britain</hi> found the evils reſulting from them, and at length ſuppreſſed them by a law.</p>
               <p>BUT <hi>cymhorthau</hi> of our countrymen were at this period of a moſt tremendous nature. They were compoſed of men the moſt dreaded by tyrants and uſurpers; of BARDS, who animated our nation, by recalling to mind the great exploits of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, their ſtruggles for liberty, their ſucceſsful conteſts with the <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> race for upwards of eight centuries. They rehearſed the cruelty of their antagoniſts, and did not forget the ſavage policy of the firſt <hi>Edward</hi> to their proſcribed bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. They brought before their countrymen the remembrance of antient prophecies. They ſhewed to them the hero <hi>Glyndwr,</hi> deſcended from the antient race of our princes; and pronounced, that in him was to be expected the completion of every predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our oracular MERLIN. The band of minſtrels now ſtruck up; the harp, the <hi>crwth,</hi> and the pipe, filled the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of enthuſiaſm which the others had begun to inſpire. They ruſhed to battle, fearleſs of events, like their great anceſtry, moved by the <hi>Druids</hi> ſongs; and ſcorned death, which conferred immortality in reward of their valor,

               <p>WE find that <hi>Glyndwr</hi> maintained his ſituation for two year; longer. In 1415, his affairs bore ſo reſpectable an aſpect, that the king condeſcended to enter into a treaty with him; and for that purpoſe deputed, from the caſtle of <hi>Porcheſter</hi>

               <p>IT was entire till the civil wars of the laſt century, when it was thrown down and broken by ſome ignorant fanatics; who thought it had too much the appearance of a croſs, to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to ſtand. It probably bore the name of one; for the field it lies in is ſtill called <hi>Llwyn-y-Groes,</hi> or the Grove of the Croſs, from the wood that ſurrounded it. It was erected at ſo early a period, that there is nothing marvellous, if we ſhould perceive a tincture of the old idolatry, or at left of the primeval cuſtoms of our country, in the mode of it when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>THE pillar never had been a croſs; notwithſtanding folly and ſuperſtition might, in later times, imagine it to have been one and have paid it the uſual honors. It was a memorial of the dead; an improvement on the rude columns of <hi>Druidical</hi> times and cut into form, and ſurrounded with inſcription. It is among the firſt lettered ſtones that ſucceeded the <hi>Meini-hirion, Meini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Gwŷr,</hi> and <hi>Llcchau.</hi> It ſtood on a great <hi>tumulus;</hi> perhaps always environed with wood (as the mount is at preſent) according to the cuſtom of the moſt antient times, when ſtanding. pillars were placed under <hi>every green tree</hi>

               <p>THE beginning of the inſcription gives us nearly the time of its erection: <q>

               <p>ONE of the ſeats of <hi>Concenn</hi> and <hi>Eliſeg</hi> was in this country. A townſhip adjacent to the column bears, from the laſt, the name of <hi>Eglwyſeg;</hi> and the pictureſque tiers of rocks are called <hi>Gliſeg</hi> for the ſame reaſon. The habitation of this prince of <hi>Powys</hi> in theſe parts was probably <hi>Dinas Brân,</hi> which lies at the head of the vale of <hi>Gliſeg.</hi> Mr. <hi>Llwyd</hi> conjectures, that this place took its name from the interment of <hi>Eliſeg;</hi> by a ſimilar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the county of <hi>Caermarthen;</hi> where the place in which a monumental ſtone ſtands, is called <hi>Pant y Polion,</hi> corruptly for <hi>Pant Pawlin,</hi> from <hi>Paulinus,</hi> the perſon it was inſcribed to:</p>

I returned by <hi>Valle Crucis;</hi> and, after winding along a ſteep midway to the old caſtle, deſcended, and after croſſing the rill of the <hi>Brán,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in the valley of <hi>Gliſſeg;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">VALLEY OF GLISSEG.</note> long and narrow, bounded on the right by the aſboniſhing precipices, divided into numberleſs paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel ſtrata of white limeſtone, often giving birth to vaſt yew-trees: and on the left, by ſmooth and verdant hills, bordered by pretty woods. One of the principal of the <hi>Gliſſeg</hi> rocks is honored with the name of <hi>Craig-Arthur.</hi> That at the end of the vale is called <hi>Craig y Forwyn,</hi> or the maiden's; is bold, precipitous, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates with a vaſt natural column.</p>
               <p>THIS valley is chiefly inhabited (happily) by an independent race of warm and wealthy yeomanry, undevoured as yet by the great men of the country.</p>
               <p>IN order to get into the great road, I purſued a path up a ſteep aſcent to the left; and about mid-way viſited a houſe noted for being the reſidence of one <hi>Edward Davies,</hi> a low partizan. and plunderer on the ſide of the uſurper during the civil wars.

He once concealed Sir <hi>Evan Llwyd</hi> of <hi>Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dris,</hi> at the time that a conſiderable ſum was ordered for his apprehenſion. He lodged him in a cellar below the parlor; then ſummoning his people, ordered them, in a ſeeming rage, to ſally out in queſt of Sir <hi>Evan,</hi> ſtamping with his foot, and declaring, that if the knight was <hi>above ground,</hi> he would have him.</p>
               <p>AFTER continuing an aſcent for a little ſpace longer, reach the paſs called <hi>Bwlch y Rhiw Velen,</hi>

the frequent violation of the remains of the dead, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of treaſures, even for centuries after this cuſtom had ceaſed.</p>
               <p>THE third age was called <hi>Chriſtendoms-old,</hi> when the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtianity put a ſtop to the former cuſtoms: for 'Chriſtians,' as the learned phyſician of <hi>Norwich</hi> obſerves, <q>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred this ſpecies of obſequies; and though they ſtickt not to give their bodies to be burnt in their lives, deteſted that mode after death; affecting rather depoſiture than abſumption, and properly ſubmitted unto the ſentence of GOD, to return not unto aſhes, but to duſt again.</q>
               </p>
               <p>FROM the remarks of theſe able writers, we may learn the time of the abolition of the cuſtom of burning among the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral nations; for it ceaſed with paganiſm. It therefore fell firſt into diſuſe with the <hi>Britons;</hi> for it was for ſome time retained by the <hi>Saxons</hi> after their conqueſt of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but was left off on their receiving the light of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. The <hi>Danes</hi> retained the cuſtom of urn-burial the laſt of any: for of all the northern nations who had any footing in theſe kingdoms, they were the lateſt who embraced the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Chriſtianity.</p>

               <p>FROM <hi>Llanarmon</hi> I continued my journey along the bad roads of that pariſh. The country now grows more contracted, by the approximation of the hills. On one ſide are the rocky ledges of limeſtone, in the townſhip of <hi>Tre'r Yrys,</hi> rich in lead-ore; and which is ſuppoſed to have taken its name from <hi>Gyrys,</hi> who made the firſt collection of <hi>Welſh</hi> proverbs, known by the name of <hi>Mad-waith bén Gyrys o Jal,</hi> or the good work of old Gyrys of <hi>Yale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ON the left are the <hi>Clwydian</hi> hills, which divide this country from the vale of <hi>Clwyd.</hi> Theſe are cultivated pretty high; are free from rocks, covered with heath.</p>
               <p>THERE is a <hi>Bwlch,</hi> or paſs through theſe hills, of a moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable name, lying between the ſummits called <hi>Moel Eithinen,</hi> and <hi>Moel Fenlli,</hi> in this pariſh. This is called <hi>Bwlch Agricla,</hi> or the paſs of <hi>Agriccla;</hi> and, ſince there is no other tranſlation to be given of the <hi>welſh</hi> word, we may conjecture this to have been his paſſage to <hi>Mona.</hi> That the <hi>Romans</hi> were in after-times reſident in theſe parts, is evident from the number of coins found

in the neighborhood, particularly in the pariſh of <hi>Llanverres,</hi> where abundance of <hi>Denarii</hi> have been met with.</p>
               <p>MOEL FENLLI, or <hi>Benlli</hi>'s hill, is remarkable for having on it a ſtrong <hi>Britiſh</hi> poſt, guarded as uſual by dikes and foſſes. This probably was poſſeſſed by a chieftain of that name; for <hi>Nen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>

St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi> ſays the abbot, deſigned to make this <hi>Benlli</hi> a viſit; but meeting with a moſt inhoſpitable reception, was kindly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by a ſervant of the king in his humble cottage; who killed his only calf, dreſſed, and placed it before the ſaint and his companions. This goodneſs met with its reward; for lo! the next morning the identical calf was found alive and well with its mother.</p>
               <p>A LITTLE beyond this paſs, entered the pariſh of <hi>Llanverres,</hi> rich in mineral. Paſs through the village, and by the church. The laſt is dedicated to St. <hi>Berres (Britius)</hi> diſciple of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> the <hi>Hungarian,</hi> and his ſucceſor in the biſhoprick of <hi>Tours,</hi> the latter end of the fourth century.

               <p>THE eaſt end of the old church was repaired in 1650, by Dr. <hi>John Davies,</hi> the author of the <hi>Welſh-Latin</hi> dictionary, a moſt ſkilful antiquary; native of this pariſh.</p>

               <p>MY route this time led me eaſtward, along the great road, into the county of FLINT.</p>
               <p>THIS ſpot being confirmed to it by the event of a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive law-ſuit, by the court of exchequer, in 1763, between the <hi>Groſvenour</hi> family and the lords of the manor of <hi>Mold:</hi> the firſt claming it as part of his mineral grant of the hundred of <hi>Yale;</hi> the others affirming it to be part of the county of <hi>Flint,</hi> and within the pariſh of <hi>Mold.</hi> The deciſion, which was in favor of the lords of <hi>Mold,</hi> is recorded on an arch over a noted ſtone, called <hi>Carreg Carn March Arthur;</hi> which was then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to be the boundary of the pariſh of <hi>Mold</hi> in the county of <hi>Flint,</hi> and of <hi>Llanverres</hi> in that of <hi>Denbigh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I CONTINUED along the great road; and, within two miles of <hi>Mold,</hi> hung long over the charming vale which opens with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite beauty from <hi>Vron,</hi> the ſeat of the ingenious <hi>Richard Williams</hi> Eſquire. <hi>Cambria</hi> here lays aſide her majeſtic air, and condeſcends to aſſume a gentler form, in order to render leſs violent her approaching union with her <hi>Engliſh</hi> neighbor. It were to be wiſhed ſhe had acted with more moderation, and not outſhone it at a rate, the moſt partial <hi>Saxon</hi> muſt allow it to have done.</p>

                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:0181900401:433"/>THIS was antiently called <hi>Yſtrad-Alun,</hi> or the <hi>Strath</hi> of the <hi>alun;</hi> a comot in the cantref <hi>Y Rhiw:</hi> inhabited by a hardy race, at perpetual feud with the men of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> on one ſide, and the men of <hi>Yale</hi> on the other: for my countrymen never ſuffered their active ſwords to ruſt; in default of <hi>Saxon,</hi> they would take up with the blood of their <hi>Cambrian</hi> neighbors.</p>
               <p>ON the firſt regulation of the <hi>Welſh</hi> counties by <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. this vale, then called <hi>Moleſdale,</hi> with the continuation of it which went under the name of <hi>Hopeſdale,</hi> were annexed to the county of <hi>Denbigh;</hi> but, in the 33d year of the ſame monarch, were given to <hi>Flintſire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ALMOST the whole is ſeen from this ſpot; a delicious compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of rich land finely bounded by gentle riſings, watered by <hi>Alun,</hi> and varied with a pretty town and fine church in the middle; with numbers of ſeats, groves, and well-cultivated farms. Among the former appears conſpicuous, <hi>Leeſwood,</hi> the creation of the late Sir <hi>George Wynne,</hi> riſing palace-like along a fine ſlope on the ſouth ſide of the vale, ſurrounded with woods and lawns; a ſad <hi>Mauſoleum</hi> of fugacious wealth! The diſtant view is not leſs beautiful. The three fine eſtuaries of the <hi>Dee, Weever,</hi> and <hi>Merſey,</hi> the hills of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and the more remote range of thoſe of <hi>Shropſhire, Staffordſhire, Derbyſhire, Yorkſhire, Lancaſhire, Weſtmoreland,</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> complete this beautiful ſcene.</p>
               <p>FROM hence to the town of <hi>Mold</hi> is a pleaſant ride. <hi>Mold</hi> conſiſts principally of one broad and handſome ſtreet on a gentle riſing, in the midſt of a ſmall but rich plain. The church is placed on an eminence; and is of the time of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0181900401:434"/>
adorned with a very handſome ſteeple built of late years. Before the Reformation, it belonged to the abby of <hi>Buſtleſham,</hi> or <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham,</hi> in <hi>Berkſhire.</hi> The living is a vicarage, and has dependent on it the chapelries of <hi>Nerquys</hi> and <hi>Treuddyn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE architecture of the church is of the gothic of that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, the windows large, and their arches obtuſe. Within and without, is a row of animals carved, as uſual at that period. The ſame may be obſerved on the old building over St. <hi>Winifrede</hi>'s well. The inſide is extremely elegant; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of a nave and two ailes, ſupported by ſeven arches, whoſe pillars are much to be admired for their lightneſs. They conſiſt of four round pilaſters, with the intermediate ſpace hollowed, and the capitals elegantly carved. Between the ſprings of every arch is an angel holding a ſhield, on which are either the arms of benefactors, or the inſtruments of the Paſſion. The arms of the <hi>Stanlies,</hi> who long poſſeſſed this manor, are very frequent. Among the other ſculptures, is the <hi>Veronica,</hi> or face of our Saviour impreſſed on a handkerchief given to him by a woman on his way to the place of crucifixion. He took it, wiped his face, and returned it with the miraculous impreſſion. This precious relique is preſerved in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the woman worſhipped as a ſaint, under the name of the <hi>Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;</hi> which at firſt was called the <hi>Vera Icon,</hi> or true image; but becoming thus perſonified, received the title of St. <hi>Veronica.</hi> Beneath two windows above the chancel, are carved in a rude manner, the nails, pincers, and other tokens of the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion.</p>

               <p>THE mount is now called the <hi>Bailey</hi>-hill, from the word <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi> or caſtle-yard.

               <p>I AM uncertain how long the crown reſerved this lordſhip.

means, regained the lordſhip of <hi>Hope;</hi> but that of <hi>Mold</hi> is at preſent the property of lady <hi>Vincent.</hi> The mineral advantages of the manor, which have, at times, been very conſiderable, are equally, divided between her ladyſhip, the <hi>Trevors,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> of <hi>Tyddyn.</hi>

               <p>FROM <hi>Mold,</hi> I took the weſt ſide of the vale; a tract filled with numbers of gentlemen's ſeats of independent fortunes, as yet not caught and abſorbed in the gulphy vortex of our <hi>Leviathans.</hi> Theſe are the remnants of the cuſtom of gavel-kind, ſo prevalent formerly in <hi>North Wales,</hi> and which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unimproved by thoſe accidents which, by time and chance, happen to many.

                  <note place="margin">TOWER.</note> to enjoy the witty, the lively and agreeable converſation of the reverend Doctor <hi>William Wynne</hi> (now departed).

He and his people were in continual feud with the citizens of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> In 1465, a conſiderable number of the latter came to <hi>Mold</hi> fair; a fray enſued between the two parties; a dreadful

An attempt was made afterwards to ſeize <hi>Reinallt;</hi> and two hundred tall men ſallied from <hi>Cheſter</hi> for that purpoſe. He retired from his houſe to a neighboring wood, permitted part of his enemies to enter the building; then ruſhing from his cover, faſtened the door; and, ſetting fire to the place, burnt them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy: he then attacked the reſt, purſued them to the ſea-ſide, where thoſe who eſcaped the ſword, periſhed in the channel.

               <p>THE limeſtone and the chert of our mineral tracts are of unknown depth; neither their bottom, nor that of the fiſſars or veins which croſs them, have ever been diſcovered.<note place="margin">DEPTH OF VEINS.</note> The ore of lead has been followed to the depth of a hundred and thirty, or a hundred and forty yards, and then has ceaſed; but the unprofitable vein appears below uncloſed. Our mines, as I have ſhewn before, have been worked from very early times<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 51.</note>, but not without long interruptions. But as ſeveral of our veins have been purſued for a hundred years paſt, the point may be affirmed of the depth to which they bear ore in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>THE veins run either north and ſouth, or eaſt and weſt.<note place="margin">THEIR COURSE.</note> But it is remarkable, that the lead ore got in the firſt, ſcarcely ever produces a quantity of ſilver worth the refiner's labor. The ores of <hi>Mold</hi> mountain, and <hi>Minera,</hi> yield ſcarcely any ſilver.</p>
               <p>THE minerals of the tracts in queſtion, are ore of lead, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamine, or <hi>Lapis calaminaris;</hi> and a mineral, that anſwers the ſame purpoſe, called by the miners <hi>black jack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR ores of lead differ in quality. The lamellated,<note place="margin">ORES OF LEAD: THEIR PRODUCE OF LEAD.</note> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon kind, uſually named <hi>potters ore,</hi> yields from fourteen to ſixteen hundred and a quarter of lead, from twenty hundred of the ore: but the laſt produce is rare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="418" facs="tcp:0181900401:460"/>THE quantity of ſilver produced from our lead is alſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable.<note place="margin">OF SILVER.</note> The upper part of a vein of lead ore is always richeſt in ſilver; the bottom, in lead. Our refiners will aſſay any lead that will yield ten ounces in the ton of lead and upwards. The uſual produce is fourteen ounces: ſixteen have been gotten; but acquiſitions of that kind within this circuit are extremely uncommon.</p>
               <p>SOME years ago, a green lead ore was diſcovered in the <hi>ſilver</hi> rake on <hi>Halkin</hi> mountain.<note place="margin">GREEN LEAD-ORE.</note> Only a ſmall quantity was found, which yielded about thirteen hundred and a quarter from a tun of the ore. It was of a very ſtubborn quality, and reſiſted the greateſt powers of the blaſt furnace before it would yield any metal.</p>
               <p>THE brown or whitiſh ſtoney ſpecies of ore called <hi>Caulk,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">BROWN, OR CAULK.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce from five hundred and a quarter to eleven hundred of lead from the ton. The ſmelters likewiſe get from what is called <hi>waſte,</hi> or the hillocks, which are the refuſe of good ores, ſo mixed with clay, gravel, ſtone, or calamine, as not to be ſeparated but by fire, from ten to thirteen hundred of lead per ton.</p>
               <p>WE have had at different periods mines productive of vaſt wealth in ſeveral parts of this tract.<note place="margin">RICH MINES.</note> The richeſt vein was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered about fifty years ago at <hi>Rowley</hi>'s rake, or <hi>Pant y Pwll dwr</hi> on <hi>Halkin</hi> mountain, continued with ſome interruption into a ſmall incloſure, the property of Sir <hi>George Wynne</hi> of <hi>Leeſwood,</hi> and the freehold of Mr. <hi>David Hughes;</hi> which, in leſs than thirty years, yielded to different proprietors, adventurers, and ſmelters, above a million of money. The reader will naturally expect to find in theſe parts a nation of <hi>Craeſus</hi>'s; but <hi>citò parta,</hi>
                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:0181900401:461"/>
                  <hi>citò dilabuntur.</hi> It is at this time an undetermined queſtion, whether more wealth has been gotten out of the earth, or more loſt in the ſearch after the prizes in this ſubterraneous lottery.</p>
               <p>MUCH of the ore obtained in our country is ſmelted in the ſeveral furnaces belonging to different companies: much alſo is exported in the form of ore. I wiſhed to be acquainted with the annual quantity ſmelted from thoſe of the country; but found, by reaſon of the ores imported from <hi>Scotland</hi> and other parts, that the computation would be of inſuperable difficulty. All the lead and ore is exported from the port of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> a ſmall quantity excepted, conſumed by the plumbers and other trades in the adjacent parts. I therefore refer the reader to pages 196, 197, for the number of tuns ſent from that port in the years 1771, 1776.

               <p>THE reader need not be told, that the former were the years of mineral plenty; and ſuch, which I muſt ſay, are ſeldom known.

               <p>CALAMINE is found in great abundance in the veins of lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and chert, in the ſame manner as the ores of lead. Where there is plenty of the former, there is little or none of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The calamine is alſo entirely confined to the eaſtern ſide of the country. About a thouſand tons of this mineral is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually exported. I have mentioned, in p. 62. how little it was known in <hi>Flintſhire</hi> till within theſe ſixty years; and may here add, that we were indebted to <hi>John Barrow,</hi> a native of <hi>Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> who being well acquainted with that mineral in his own country, pointed out to us its uſes.</p>
               <p>CALAMINE aſſumes various ſhapes and colors. Green, yellow, red, and black, often has a ſtony appearance, and often like the lattice work of bones.

                  <p>The damp had been perceived for ſome time before,<note place="margin">IN MOSTYN COLLIERY.</note> reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling fiery blades darting and croſſing each other from both ſides of the pit. The uſual methods were taken to free the pit from this evil. After a ceſſation of work for three days, the ſteward thinking to fetch a compaſs about from the eye of the pit that came from the day, and to bring wind by a ſecure way along with him, that, if it burſt again, it might be done without danger of men's lives, went down, and took two men along with him, which ſerved his turn for this purpoſe. He was no ſooner down, but the reſt of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that had wrought there, diſdaining to be left behind in ſuch a time of danger, haſted down after them; and one of them, more indiſcreet than the reſt, went headlong with his candle over the eye of the damp-pit, at which the damp im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately catched, and flew to and fro over all the hollows of the work, with a great wind, and a continual fire; and, as it went, keeping a mighty great roaring noiſe on all ſides.</p>
                  <p>THE men, at firſt appearance of it, had moſt of them fallen upon their faces, and hid themſelves as well as they could, in
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:0181900401:465"/>
the looſe, ſlack, or ſmall-coal, and under the ſhelter of poſts; yet, nevertheleſs, the damp returning out of the hollows, and drawing towards the eye of the pit, it came up with incredible force; the wind and fire tore moſt of their clothes off their backs, and ſinged what was left, burning their hair, faces, and hands; the blaſts falling ſo ſharp on their ſkin, as if they had been whipt with cords. Some, that had leſt ſhelter, were carried fifteen or ſixteen yards from their firſt ſtation, and beaten againſt the roof of the coal, and ſides of the poſt, and lay afterwards a good while ſenſeleſs; ſo that it was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could hear or find one another. As it drew up to the day-pit, it caught one of the men along with it, that was next to the eye; and up it comes, with ſuch a terrible crack, not unlike, but more ſhrill, than a cannon, that was heard fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles off, with the wind; and ſuch a pillar of ſmoak, as darkened all the ſky over-head for a good while. The brow of the hill above the pit was eighteen yards high, and on it grew trees of fourteen or fifteen yards long; yet the man's body, and other things from the pit, were ſeen above the tops of the higheſt trees, at leaſt 100 yards. On this pit ſtood a horſe-engine of ſubſtantial timber, and ſtrong iron work; on which lay a trunk, or barrel, for winding the rope up and down, of above 1000 pounds weight; it was then in motion, one bucket going down, and the other coming up full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This trunk was faſtened to that frame with locks and bolts of iron; yet it was thrown up, and carried a good way from the pit; and pieces of it, though bound with iron-hoops and ſtrong nails, blown into the woods about: ſo likewiſe were
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0181900401:466"/>
the two buckets; and the ends of the rope, after the buckets were blown from them, ſtood a while upright in the air like pikes, and then came leiſurely drilling down. The whole frame of the engine was ſtirred, and moved out of its place; and thoſe mens clothes, caps, and hats, that eſcaped, were afterwards found ſhattered to pieces, and thrown amongſt the woods a great way from the pit.</p>

<pb n="427" facs="tcp:0181900401:469"/>
ſeſſions of the bards and minſtrels for many centuries. It was the reſort of thoſe of a certain diſtrict; as <hi>Aberfraw</hi> in <hi>Angleſea</hi> was of thoſe of that iſland, and the neighboring county; and <hi>Mathraval</hi> of thoſe of the land of <hi>Powys.</hi> The reaſon that theſe places were thus diſtinguiſhed, was, becauſe the two laſt were the reſidence of princes; and <hi>Caerwys,</hi> on account of the royal palace that ſtood below the town, the reſidence of <hi>Llewelyn ap Gryffydd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THESE <hi>Eiſteddfods</hi> were the <hi>Britiſh Olympics.</hi> Fired at firſt with generous emulation, our poets crowded into the liſt, and carried off the prize, contented with the mere honor of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. At length, when the competitors became numerous, and the country became oppreſſed with the multitude, new regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of courſe took place. The diſappointed candidates were no longer ſuffered to torture the ears of the principality with their wretched compoſitions. None but bards of merit were ſuffered to rehearſe their pieces; and minſtrels of ſkill, to perform. Theſe went through a long probation: judges were appointed to decide on their reſpective abilities; and degrees ſuitable were conferred, and permiſſions granted for exerciſing their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, in the manner that will be related in the following pages. The judges were appointed by commiſſion from our princes; and after the conqueſt of <hi>Wales,</hi> by the kings of <hi>England,</hi> notwithſtanding, <hi>Edward</hi> I. exerciſed a political cruelty over the generation of bards of his time; yet future princes thought fit to revive an inſtitution ſo likely to ſoften the manners of a fierce people. The crown had the power of nominating the judges, who decided not only on the merit, but the ſubject of
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:0181900401:470"/>
the poems; and, like our modern lord chamberlains, were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of licenſing only thoſe which were agreeable to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> court.</p>
               <p>BEFORE I enter on the account of the ſucceſſion of <hi>Britiſh Eiſteddſfods,</hi> I ſhall juſt mention the high antiquity of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter that made,<note place="margin">ANTIENT BARDS.</note> in after times, the principal figure in theſe meetings.

               <p>THE bards were in the higheſt repute.

They were ſuppoſed to be endowed with powers equal to inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. They were the oral hiſtorians of all paſt tranſactions, public and private.

They were likewiſe thoroughly acquainted with the works of the three primary bards, <hi>viz.</hi> MYRDDYN AP MORFRYN, MYRDDYN EMRYS, and TALIESIN BEN BEIRDD.

               <p>WHEN a ſong is called for, the <hi>Cadeir-fardd,</hi> or the bard who has got the <hi>badge of the chair,</hi> is firſt to ſing a hymn in glory of GOD; after that, another in honor of the prince.

                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:0181900401:482"/>It muſt be obſerved, that players on crwths with three ſtrings, taborers, and pipers, were reckoned among the ignoble performers: they were not allowed to ſit down, and had only a penny for their pains.</p>
               <p>THE different degrees were comprehended in this liſt. There were four in the poetical, and five in the muſical faculty. The loweſt, or more properly what ſhould be called a candidate or probationer, was <hi>Y Dyſcybl Yſpâs,</hi> or the <hi>loweſt diſciple,</hi> who was obliged (if a candidate for poetry) to underſtand the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction or five ſpecies of <hi>Englyns,</hi> and to compoſe them before a <hi>Pencerdd,</hi> who was to declare upon his conſcience, that he was endowed with a true poetical genius. After this he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced</p>
               <p>DYSCYBL DYSCYBLAIDD, <hi>Diſcipulus diſciplinabilis:</hi> here he becomes a graduate, but muſt underſtand twelve of our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent metres, and produce ſpecimens of each of his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and if in three years time he does not, by his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, acquire the next degree, he is degraded from this. If he ſucceeds, he then proceeds to the degree of</p>
               <p>DYSCYBL PENCEIRDDIAIDD, or candidate for degree of <hi>Pencerdd,</hi> when he muſt underſtand the propriety of expreſſions, and the different metres, and compoſe in twenty-one ſpecies; and if in three years he does not attain by his own merit to the next de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, he falls back into that of <hi>Dyſcybl dyſcyblaidd;</hi> otherwiſe he becomes a</p>
               <p>PENBARDD or PENCERDD, chief of the faculty he was can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate in; when it is neceſſary he ſhould be accompliſhed in every branch of his art. He then received the badge of the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:0181900401:483"/>
ſilver-harp; or that of a golden or ſilver chain, which he wore upon his ſhoulder. He alſo was placed with much ceremony on a magnificent chair, part of the <hi>furnyture</hi> mentioned in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; was there inveſted with his degree, and then acquired the honorable name of <hi>Cadeirfardd,</hi> or <hi>Bardd cadeiriawg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN inſtrumental muſic there were five degrees; which differ nothing from thoſe in the other faculty, except in the two loweſt: I. the <hi>Dyſcybl yſpas heb râdd,</hi> or without a degree, 2. <hi>Dyſcybl yſpas graddawl,</hi> or graduated; 3. <hi>Dyſcybl dyſcyblaidd;</hi> 4. <hi>Dyſcybl pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceirddiaidd;</hi> 5. <hi>Pencerdd.</hi> Theſe, like the others, were to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by their reſpective merits in the ſcience; but as then qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications are expreſſed in technical terms of <hi>Britiſh</hi> muſic, it is paſt, my ſkill to give an explanation. None but a <hi>Pencerdd</hi> ſhould preſume to become an inſtructor. The chief of our days, is that uncommon genius, the blind Mr. JOHN PARRY of RHIWABON, who has had the kingdom for his <hi>Cylch clera,</hi> or muſical circuit, and remains unrivalled.</p>
               <p>OUR PENCERDDS thus qualified, were licenſed to ſing, or to perform under certain reſtrictions. By the law of our princes, particular regard was paid to their morals: <q>They were to be no make-bates, no vagabonds, no ale-houſe haunters, no drunkards, no brawllers, no whore-hunters, no theeves, nor companions of ſuch, in which things, if they offend, everie man, by the ſtatute, is made an officer, and authorized to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and puniſh them; yea, and to take from them all that they have about them<note n="*" place="bottom">Powel, 192.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="442" facs="tcp:0181900401:484"/>THEY were prohibited from uttering any ſcandalous words in ſpeech or whiſpers; detraction, mocking, ſcoffing, inventing lies, or repeating them after others, under pain of fine and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment: nor were they to make a ſong of any perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſent; nor to enter any man's houſe without formal leave firſt obtained.</p>
               <p>EVERY <hi>Penbardd</hi> and <hi>Pencerdd</hi> was allowed to take in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples for a certain ſpace of time, but not above one at a time. A diſciple was not qualified to make another. Each was to be with his teacher during <hi>Lent,</hi> unleſs prevented by ſickneſs or impriſonment, under pain of loſing his degree. He was obliged to ſhew every compoſition to his teacher before it was publicly ſung. They were not to follow the practice of <hi>cl<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>er y dom,</hi> i. e. dunghill bards and muſicians, or any other ſpecies of vagabond minſtrels. They were enjoined a month before each feſtival, to ſettle their routs with their reſpective teachers, leaſt too many of them ſhould crowd to the ſame places; only one being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to go to a perſon who paid ten pounds a year rent; and two to ſuch who payed twenty pounds, and ſo on in proportion to thoſe of higher rank: and every teacher was obliged to keep a copy of theſe rules, to ſhew and inculcate to his pupils in time of <hi>Lent,</hi> when they came for their inſtructions.</p>
               <p>No perſon was to mimic, mock, or ſcoff at the <hi>awenyddion</hi> on account of their mental abſence, or when they had on them the AWEN or <hi>poeticus furor;</hi> from an opinion that no bard, duly authorized, could ever meditate on improper ſubjects.</p>
               <p>To whatſoever houſe they came in the time of wakes, they muſt remain there while the feaſting laſted; unleſs they had leave
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:0181900401:485"/>
from the maſter of the houſe, or were invited by another. If they wandered from houſe to houſe, they were to be apprehended as ſtrollers and vagabonds, and to be deprived of their <hi>clera</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Or their pay. Sometimes it ſignifies the act of their perambulation.</note>, which was forfeited to the uſe of the church. If they got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated, they forfeited their reward: but if they violated the chaſtity of wife or maid, they were fined and impriſoned, and loſt their <hi>clera</hi> for ſeven years.</p>
               <p>THEIR fees or rewards were regulated. <hi>A dyſcybl dyſcyblaidd</hi> was entitled to 3 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> for his <hi>cowydd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A DYSCYBL PENCEIRDDIAIDD, received for the ſame ſpecies of compoſition 6 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His teacher, or the <hi>Pencerdd,</hi> had no more; only the maſter of the houſe uſually preſented him with a garment, or ſome other mark of favor.</p>
               <p>THE minſtrels received theſe rewards; a <hi>dyſcybl yſpas graddawl</hi> had only 1 <hi>s.</hi> upon each of the great feſtivals.</p>
               <p>A DYSCYBL DYSCYBLAIDD, at the ſame ſeaſons 2 <hi>s.</hi> and a <hi>dyſcybl penceirddiaidd</hi> 3 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A PENCERDD the ſame, beſides a voluntary gratuity. He was alſo entitled to fees at royal and other weddings; and upon their <hi>cylch clera,</hi> which was permitted only once in three years. But beſides theſe fees, in order to encourage the <hi>clerwyr</hi> to keep up the language and the memory of the exploits and pedigrees of the <hi>Britons,</hi> they were allowed a penny out of every plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and a halfpenny out of every half ploughland of their diſtrict.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="444" facs="tcp:0181900401:486"/>THE <hi>Penbardd</hi> and <hi>Pencerdd,</hi> in their circuits, frequented only the houſes of the gentry; but if he degraded himſelf by viſiting the commonalty, he was only to expect the fee of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>clerwr,</hi> whoſe province it was to viſit the <hi>plebeian</hi> houſes. The following were the perſons who were allotted to entertain the vulgar ears.</p>
               <p>A PERSON laboring under any infirmity; ſuch as blindneſs, lameneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a <hi>dyſcybl yſpas,</hi> a <hi>dyſcybl dyſcyblaidd,</hi> and <hi>dyſcybl pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceirddiaidd.</hi> The firſt regulation was founded on humanity.</p>
               <p>No public feſtivity, great feaſt, or wedding could be duly ſolemnized without the preſence of the bards and minſtrels. A glorious emulation aroſe among them; and prizes were beſtowed on the moſt worthy. In 1176, the lord <hi>Rhys</hi> prince of <hi>South Wales,</hi> made a great feaſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Powel, 237.</note> at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> on account of the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his new caſtle at <hi>Aberteifi;</hi> of which he proclamed notice through all <hi>Britain</hi> a year and a day before; great was the reſort of ſtrangers, who were nobly entertained; ſo that none departed unſatisfied. Among deeds of arms, and variety of <hi>ſpectacles,</hi> RHYS invited all the bards of <hi>Wales,</hi> and provided <hi>chairs</hi> for them, which were placed in his hall, where they fat and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and ſang, to ſhew their ſkill in their reſpective faculties, and beſtowed great rewards, and rich gifts on the victors. The bards of <hi>North Wales</hi> won the prizes; but the minſtrels of <hi>Rhys</hi>'s houſhold, excelled in their faculty. On this occaſion the <hi>Brawdwr Llys,</hi> or <hi>judge of the court,</hi> an officer fifth in rank, declared aloud the victor, and received from the bard, for his fee, a mighty
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:0181900401:487"/>
drinking-horn, made of the horn of an ox; a golden ring, and the cuſhion on which he ſat in his chair of dignity<note n="*" place="bottom">Leges Wellicae, 28.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE bards of thoſe times often accompanied their voices with the harp, as they were wont of old, in the manner deſcribed by <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Lib. xv. 9.</note>. There was alſo another ſpecies of muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, of an inferior kind, called <hi>Datceiniad,</hi> who accompanied the muſical inſtruments of others with his ſong. He was infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to both bard and minſtrel; yet it was requiſite he ſhould be poſſeſſed of a conſiderable degree of knowledge in both ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: he ought to be able to tune the harp and <hi>crwth:</hi> to ſhew his ſkill in playing ſeveral notes and keys, and to be perfectly converſant in what are called the twenty-four meaſures of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſong; and to be able to ſing with judgment and melody. He was likewiſe to be maſter of reading juſtly, and writing correctly. He was not only to underſtand the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four modes of metrical compoſitions; but to exhibit ſpecimens of his own, at left in three of them; and if he met with any old ſong faultily tranſcribed, he was to rectify it. He was alſo to carry with him a harp or a <hi>crwth</hi> in a white caſe. He was further required, not only to be a ready waiter at table, but to be an expert carver of every ſpecies of fowl. At the weddings of any of the royal family, his office was to wait on the bride.</p>
               <p>ON thoſe occaſions, I am reminded of another cuſtom in which the bards were concerned. After their nuptial feaſt, a <hi>Pencerdd</hi> was conſtituted CYFF CLER, or <hi>pillar of the clêr,</hi> and
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:0181900401:488"/>
ſeated in a chair ſurrounded by the other bards ſtanding, who made him the ſubject of their merry and ludicrous compoſitions, to raiſe mirth in the company. He was that day to make no reply; but on the next, he was to divert the hall at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the inferior bards; and was alſo to compoſe a poem upon a ſubject given him ſuitable to his dignity.</p>
               <p>THE moſt inferior of the muſical tribe was ſometimes admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.<note place="margin">DATCEINIAD.</note> This was the <hi>Datceiniad pen paſtwn,</hi> or he that ſung to the ſound of his club; being ignorant of every other kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. When he was permitted to be introduced, he was obliged to ſtand in the middle of the hall, and ſing his <hi>cowydd</hi> or <hi>awdl,</hi> beating time, and playing the ſymphony with his <hi>paſtwn</hi> or club; but if there was a profeſſor of muſic preſent, his leave muſt be firſt obtained before he preſumed to entertain the company with this ſpecies of melody. Wherever he came he muſt act as a menial ſervant to the bard or muſician<note n="*" place="bottom">Several parts of this account are tranſlated from <hi>Cambrobrytannicae Cymra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecaeve Linguae Inſtitutiones;</hi> a very rare book, written by Doctor <hi>John Davydd Rhys</hi> of <hi>Llanfaethlu</hi> in <hi>Angleſey,</hi> printed in 1592.
