            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE miliary Fever, either in its ſimple or compound State, is the moſt frequent Diſeaſe that happens to Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Children, of all Degrees, and almoſt all Ages, throughout all Seaſons of the Year; in Child-bed Women 'tis rare to meet with any other Fever of Conſequence: Notwithſtanding hitherto it has been leſs taken Notice of by Authors in general, is leſs known by the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians and Apothecaries, and its
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0493500600:4"/>
               <hi>right</hi> Method of Cure leſs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, than any other <hi>acute</hi> Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that afflicts Mankind.</p>
            <p>How to account for this general, but unpardonable Ignorance, I am much at a Loſs, except the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Opinion of ſome Phyſicians, <hi>That this Fever is a Creature of our own making, and that the Eruption is brought forth by the Uſe of too hot Medicines;</hi> I ſay, except that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Opinion has run through the whole <hi>College,</hi> and from thence the dangerous Infection been conveyed to the Apothecaries; of whom the greateſt Part are indeed ſo very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate and negligent, and ſo little inquiſitive into the <hi>Nature</hi> of Diſtempers, that they muſt of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence be great Strangers to <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi>

I would not romance, or ſpeak with Malice, but can aſſert with great Confidence, that I have had an Opportunity of diſcourſing with ſome Phyſicians, and many Apothecaries, concerning the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Treatment</hi> of this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but, good God, how great their Ignorance, how unaccountable their Stupidity and Obſtinacy! I can hardly forbear bluſhing when I think of it, and yet all the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance I could give them of my Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, by Word of Mouth, had no Effect, they ſtill reſolutely perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their deſtructive Treatment, tho' half of their Patients fell under their Hands; till I had an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of convincing them by ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

<note n="(a)" place="bottom">And here I am obliged, by many Ties, to do Juſtice to that very worthy and skilful Gentleman, Sir <hi>David Hamilton,</hi> Phyſician, lately deceaſed, who in our conjunct Attendance on a Perſon of Quality in this laſt Diſtemper (the miliary Fever) did, to my great Satisfaction, ſo readily foretel every ſucceeding Change, and ſo aptly furniſh out a Remedy for every Accident, as did abundantly ſhew it familiar to him, and juſtify the Hiſtory and Method of Cure publiſhed by him, of this tedious and dangerous Diſeaſe, the miliary Fever. A Diſeaſe, tho' leſs common,

            <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0493500600:8"/>
            <p>That the Eruption is caus'd by the Uſe of too hot Medicines and Regimen, I abſolutely deny, altho' ſuch Method, I know, will prolong the Cure, if it does not ſoon kill the Patient; for I have often attended poor Men, Women, and Children, who have ſcarcely had Cloaths to cover them, and have taken no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, but drank cold Water, or
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0493500600:9"/>Small-Beer, four or five Days or lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, before I have been call'd to them, and yet this Fever, according to the beſt Account I could collect, has gone thro' its various Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, but <hi>in a terrible Manner, even to a very plentiful Eruption of the cryſtalline</hi> Puſtles; but, by the Uſe of <hi>too cold a Regimen,</hi> then almoſt ready to expire for Want of other Aſſiſtance, ſuch as <hi>cordial</hi> and <hi>diaphoretic</hi> Medicines, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them ſafely thro' the laſt Stage of the Diſeaſe, which was by ſuch Means very ſoon and ſurpriſingly effected.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1741, this Fever in its worſt Degree was more epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal than ever I have found it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my Time, and ſwept away great
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0493500600:10"/>Numbers of People of all Degrees and Ages under Fifty, (for few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that Age were then ſeiz'd with it,) inſomuch that the Bills of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality amounted weekly to twelve or fifteen Hundred, for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Time: In the Beginning of this Conſtitution, Patients were treated, by other Practiſers as well as myſelf, with Bleeding and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting indiſcriminately, Bliſtering early and without Mercy, <hi>Sal Nitri,</hi> or Saline Draughts, with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Sal. Vol. C. C.</hi> which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd four or five Days without <hi>real</hi> Advantage, and were then changed for <hi>Conf. Raleigh,</hi> which, doing no more Service than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, was again chang'd in three or four Days more for <hi>Sal. C. C. Pulv. Serp. &amp;c.</hi> which then brought on
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0493500600:11"/>
               <hi>Delirium</hi> and <hi>Subſultus Tendinum,</hi> Symptoms which introduc'd a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Bliſtering Plaiſters from Head to Foot, which were not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to relieve the Patient in any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, ſo long as the Cauſes of all this Miſchief, <hi>too hot Medicines,</hi> were daily repeated, till the Scene clos'd in Death; but which did not frequently happen till the 15th, 20th, or ſometimes the 25th Day; with this Satisfaction only to their ſurviving Relations and Friends, <hi>that they had,</hi> as they thought, <hi>done all that could be done for the Deceas'd;</hi> altho', to ſpeak the Truth, they could not take a more effectual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to remove them out of the World. This ſhocking Succeſs, which made me almoſt weary of my Profeſſion, as I could not avoid
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0493500600:12"/>thinking, that we all treated this Fever after a wrong Manner, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me often to think ſeriouſly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Matter, and examine many of the beſt Authors, who had wrote of Fevers; I could find nothing in them that ſuited my Purpoſe, and but very few that even mention'd ſuch a Fever; till, dipping into <hi>Allen</hi>'s <hi>Synopſis,</hi> I found that Sir <hi>David Hamilton</hi>'s Treatiſe upon that Subject was my chief Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<note n="(c)" place="bottom">I did not know that Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore</hi> had wrote upon that Subject, till very lately I accidentally read his Diſcourſe of the Plague, wherein I found a previous Account of the miliary Fever.</note> This I procur'd, and, after reading it over and over again with great Attention, determin'd to follow the ſame Method in that Caſe, with all the Patients who ſhould
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0493500600:13"/>happen afterwards to fall under my <hi>ſole</hi> Management; as I religiouſly obſerv'd the <hi>ſpeculative,</hi> as well as the <hi>practical</hi> Part, ſo did I ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as happily conduct my Patients thro' every Stage of the Diſeaſe; for, as before, not more than five out of ten liv'd, ſo now <hi>not one in ten died,</hi> and thoſe only who had ſome other Diſeaſe in Conjunction with this Fever; with this Inconvenience only, that the Cure, tho' almoſt certain, was very tedious, even 20, 25, or 30 Days. But happy was I, that I had met with even a tedious Cure; nothing now remain'd for me to do, but farther to conſider if it was not practicable to contract the Cure within a ſhorter Compaſs, by more powerful Medicines, and yet ſuch as would by no Means ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0493500600:14"/>the Symptoms. Whilſt I was thus pondering, I recollected that my Author obſerv'd, as a favourable Prognoſtic, <hi>that the drowsier Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents are, the happier they recover</hi>

. Reaſoning with myſelf upon this Principle, I luckily hit upon a ſpeedier Method, which from Time to Time, with the greateſt Care and Attention, I alter'd, till I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd the Cure of this devouring Fever to as great Certainty, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any we can boaſt of in the Practice of Phyſic: Thus I fix'd the Rule of my Practice for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which I have continu'd from that Time to this, with ſo
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0493500600:15"/>much Succeſs, that, for ſeven Years paſt, I confidently affirm, I have not loſt above <hi>four Patients out of a Hundred,</hi> of that Fever in its ſimple State; nay furthermore, for one Patient that I have had under my Care fifteen Days, ten have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly recover'd in two Thirds of the Time, and, even in many, all dangerous Symptoms have been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely remov'd before the Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appear'd; which, altho' it may ſeem ſtrange to moſt of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, is nevertheleſs no more ſtrange than true, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may prove, if they diligently obſerve the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Diſeaſe, and exactly follow the Method of Cure, as I have done before them.</p>

            <p>For the preſent Purpoſe, I have abſtracted from Sir <hi>David Hamilton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore,</hi> all that I judge neceſſary in Relation to the Deſcription and Nature of this Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; to which I have added occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Remarks, and my own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Cure, which by repeated Trials, and diligent Obſervation, I have prov'd to be more eaſy, ſpeedy, and ſafe, than even theirs, or any other, that I know of; if any Body ſhall hereafter publiſh a better, I ſhall receive the ſame with as much Satisfaction as I communicate mine, having nothing more at Heart than the Service of my Profeſſion, and the Uſe of all poſſible Means for the public Welfare.

<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0493500600:17"/>in <hi>general,</hi> which (how much ſoever I may be cenſur'd for it) I am ſure they ſtand much in Need of at this Time of Day, as their own Conſciences muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly tell them; for it is not the Phyſician's Attendance and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, on which they ſo much rely, that will <hi>alone</hi> cure Diſeaſes; there are many other Requiſites ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, which of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence fall to the <hi>Medicaſter's</hi> Share.</p>

               <p>I Have choſen to deſcribe, before all other Diſeaſes, the Nature and Method of curing a <hi>Miliary Fever;</hi> becauſe I know of none who have hitherto treated of this Fever, as of a different Sort, at leaſt, in any ſatisfactory Way; when, notwithſtanding, I have known it, in ſeveral, to turn either into a chronical Diſtemper, or in a ſhort Time to prove fatal. For this ſometimes comes to paſs, in a mild Beginning of this Diſtemper, from a Neglect of themſelves, or thro' an Impatience of the Sick at its long Continuance; and ſometimes
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:0493500600:20"/>alſo from the <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, being deluded with its fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Symptoms; or, laſtly, thro' an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Fear
<note n="(e)" place="bottom">The Patient will be in no Danger, on that Account, now; for that Sort of Fear has been long ſince baniſhed.</note> of being thought greedy of Gain, they omit conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing their neceſſary Viſits. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I have thought it a Work wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of my Time, if by theſe my Obſervations, being diligently col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the daily Inſpection, or Attendance upon ſick Perſons, I might afford ſome Light to young Practitioners; and by theſe Means ſtir up the more ſkilful to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh their own; and the Reader may aſſuredly believe, that I have acted with great Veracity.</p>

               <head>OF THE MILIARY FEVER.</head>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the Name, Kind, and Sorts of this Diſtemper.</head>
                  <p>A Miliary Fever take its Name from the Puſtles, or Veſicles, in ſome Sort reſembling the Form of Gromwel Seeds, appearing chiefly about the upper Parts; yet I think it ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be called a veſicular Fever, becauſe the Puſtles are Veſicles, or little Bliſters, filled at firſt with a limpid Serum, and afterwards with a whitiſh, not unlike to the Colour of Pearls.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0493500600:22"/>
                  <p>There are ſome who think, that only the peſtilential and ſpotted Fevers ought to be reckoned amongſt the malign Kind; but I am of Opinion, that there are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe others of a different Species, which may very well be referred to the malign Claſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What Kind of Fevers ſoever, which are acquired by Contact, or Breathing <hi>(Vapour)</hi> or any other Manner of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Alſo thoſe Sorts of Fevers, which, immediately from the Beginning, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a violent Pain, and fix'd to ſome Part; as to the Head, or Region of the Guts, or Kidneys, or even to the Limbs: Like as if the Patient ſhould be affected with a Pain of the Head, or a Cholic, or a nephritic, or a gouty, or a rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Pain; or even with the Pains (like thoſe) of Child-birth, as if the ſame was an original Diſtemper; when, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0493500600:23"/>ſuch Sort are the Symptoms of a miliary Fever; they will not give Way to Remedies which are wont to be of Service, when the Diſeaſes ſo nam'd are primary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Alſo in whom the animal Spirits are ſuddenly oppreſs'd and eclips'd; and where the aforeſaid Symptoms ſeem to depend on no evident Cauſe, but on a certain la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Poiſon, call'd, by the Antients, an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Quality, and by the Moderns, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours.</p>
                  <p>Or, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> where ſudden Death ariſes from a Cauſe which ſeems to be void of Danger; all which, as they denote a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, ſo alſo have I obſerved the ſame to happen in a miliary Fever.</p>
                  <p>And it is worthy of Remark, that this Fever rages with the ſame Malignity, as the petechial or ſpotted Fever in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0493500600:24"/>
                  <p>This Kind of Fever is two-fold, ſimple and compound. I call it ſimple, as often as no Puſtles beſides the miliary appear, whereof I am going to diſcourſe; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, when red, papillary Puſtules are interſpers'd with the miliary, and which, when they are ſolitary, are commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Raſh. And it is farther to be obſerv'd that miliary Puſtules are ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix'd with the Small-Pox, and, while the Small-Pox riſes up, thoſe gradually wither away; but remain ſtanding, after the papillary are dried up.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>A Deſcription of the Miliary Fever.</head>
                  <p>That I may the better deſcribe the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of a miliary Fever, I ſhall reckon up the Antecedents, Concomitants, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences.</p>
                  <p>The Antecedents are, a weak Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Body, whether the ſame be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0493500600:25"/>or adventitious, caus'd by immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Evacuations, or too ſpare Diet; a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or wat'ry Blood; a weak and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Mind, and eaſily annoy'd by external Accidents, as in Women and effeminate Men; much and deep Study (or Thought-fulneſs) or Sorrow; an Obſtruction, or Ulcer in any Part, attended with Pain: Whence thoſe Perſons who have been long afflicted with a Cholic Pain, Gout, or Stone, or an Ulcer of the Kidneys, are more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to this Fever. Alſo an inward Heat in Women, with or without Thirſt, and eſpecially about the Time of their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, whereby alſo the Pains of Child-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are leſs ſevere than uſual, and the Spirits, without any evident Cauſe, are very much depreſs'd, with an Oppreſſion of the Breaſt, cauſing Sighs; wherein, as in all other Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, here alſo generally happens an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Coldneſs.</p>
                  <p>The Concomitants, or Symptoms ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying this Fever, are oftentimes a Pain reſembling that of the Cholic, Stone
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0493500600:26"/>of the Kidneys, Pleuriſy, Rheumatiſm, or that of Child-birth; likewiſe an Oppreſſion of the Breaſt, with a Sinking of the Spirits: And, two or three Days after the ſaid Pain is gone off, there comes on a Shivering of the whole Body, and then a Coldneſs and an Heat alternately ariſe. Yet this Heat is milder than in a common continual Fever, and comes nearer to that of natural; the Palms of the Hands are affected with a more intenſe Heat, while the Back-part is much cooler; the Pulſe alſo is frequent, but weak; the Spirits often flag very much; and the Breaſt, being oppreſſed as it were with a great Weight, cauſeth Sighings; the Sleep ſtealing on is ſuddenly interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the moſt inſeparable Token of all the Symptoms; for the Patients are often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sleep for many Days and Nights to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<note n="(f)" place="bottom">This Symptom will ſcarcely, or ever, be met with, if the Fever be treated in the Manner, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after directed.</note> without a Delirium, or a Pain of the Head, and generally much longer than in other Fevers. I met with a very
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0493500600:27"/>ſingular Example of this Caſe, in a certain Lady who was under the Care of the learned Dr. <hi>Bernard.</hi> She was a whole Month in this Fever, without Sleep; yet free of a Delirium, or any Pain in the Head.</p>
                  <p>The Tongue is ſometimes cover'd over with white <hi>Aphthoe,</hi> or a Thruſh, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times like that of Perſons in Health; the Urine is one while as pale as common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at others, of a natural Colour: Which Symptoms, deceiving young Phyſicians, make them frequently attribute this Effect to the Vapours, as they term it. They who are ſeized with this Fever, are ſome times afflicted with a Sickneſs at Stomach, eſpecially after Sleep; and ſometimes with a Soreneſs, either by their own Negligence, or <hi>a bad</hi> Practice; to wit, while <hi>heating Medicines,</hi> uſual in hyſteric Paroxyſms, are preſcrib'd, <hi>without Diaphoretics;</hi> whence in Lieu of a mild Procedure of Nature, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the morbific Matter by a <hi>gentle Sweating,</hi> a rapid Fermentation throws down the ſame into the Guts. The Belly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0493500600:28"/>is ſometimes bound, and sometimes loose, with a Sickneſs at the Stomach, and Pains of the Bowels; one while they are thirſty, at others, very little; ſometimes the Hands and Tongue, being ſtretched out to the Phyſician, tremble, and the Patient ſpeaks in a trembling Manner; they are alſo often moleſted with convulſive Motions, a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, and a difficult Reſpiration; the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerbations of which Symptoms return like the Paroxyſms of an intermitting Fever. An Oppreſſion of the Breaſt with Sighing, or a greater Sinking of the Spirits, without manifeſt Cauſe; Watchings, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the Spirits, commonly called a Hurry in the Head, as often as the Sick compoſe themſelves to Sleep; as likewiſe a frequent and weak Pulſe, being conjoin'd with certain other Symptoms, are always the Fore-runners of the miliary Puſtles at Hand: And they are all wont to continue till the miliary Puſtles break out, and then the Patients are freed from moſt of them.</p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0493500600:29"/>
                  <p>Theſe Puſtles generally appear in the Breaſt, Neck, and Interſtices of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſometimes alſo in the whole Body; and, after a daily and gradual Increaſe, they at laſt vaniſh away, leaving the Skin rough in the Seats of the Puſtles. They ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times itch, eſpecially in a complex miliary Fever; that is, where red papillary Puſtles are mix'd with the miliary. And it is to be obſerv'd, that, by how much ſimpler this Fever is, by ſo much ſlighter are the Symptoms, and which for this very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon frequently creates a Neglect, both in the unwary Phyſicians, and in the Patients; whereby this Fever either becomes more perilous, or another Diſeaſe often ariſes; for, by taking leſs Care at firſt than ought to have been uſed, it ſometimes begins with more grievous Symptoms; as, with a Sickneſs of the Stomach, Loſs of Appetite, an inward Heat, an Oppreſſion of the Breaſt, Sinking of the Spirits, Sighing and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Returns of Heat and Cold, Watchings, and the like. In the Declination of this
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0493500600:30"/>Fever, the upper Part of the Hands are often moiſten'd with a cold Sweat.</p>
                  <p>It is very difficult to obſerve, whether the miliary Puſtles are wont to appear on a certain Day; ſeeing the firſt Appearance of this Diſtemper, and the Patient's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſame, are ſo uncertain. But, as far as I can learn, I take them moſtly to appear about the Tenth or Eleventh Day from the Beginning, if ſo be the Fever have a regular Progreſs, and are dried up about the Eighteenth; or, where there is Plenty of morbific Matter, about the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-firſt or Twenty-ſecond Day.</p>
                  <p>I have chiefly endeavour'd to obſerve the Time of the Eruption in thoſe Women, to whom I have been call'd, on the Third Day after their Delivery; and have heard them complaining of a Shivering or Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, follow'd with an Heat: For when I found, in looking upon their Breaſt and Neck, the miliary Puſtles there, I conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they had been ſeiz'd many Days
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0493500600:31"/>before with a miliary Fever; and, upon a ſtrict Scrutiny made even from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Diſtemper, I underſtood that they had perceiv'd either a preternatural Heat, or a Pain of ſome Part, with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Thirſt, and a vehement Oppreſſion of the Breaſt, with Sighings, and a Sinking of the Spirits before they were brought to-bed; which Symptoms being ſuppos'd to depend on the approaching Birth, they hop'd all wou'd be well, when it was over. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, altho' they have the Pains of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth milder than uſual, yet the great Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Breaſt in ſuch, with the Sighing and Deficiency of Spirits (called by the Midwives Fear and Vapours) and the quick and weak Pulſe are ſure Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticſ of the approaching miliary Puſtles; to whoſe Eruption in Child-bed Women, a Way is made by their compoſing in Bed to ſweat: Therefore I commonly reckon ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Days from the firſt inward Heat, or Pain before the Birth, to the Eruption after the Birth. But the Ignorance, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous Relation the Patients give of their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0493500600:32"/>own State, do, for the moſt Part, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Phyſician's Prognoſtic, that even the moſt curious can't find out the very Day.</p>
                  <p>The Conſequences of a miliary Fever, as far as my Obſervation reacheth, are a Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Thighs, Legs, and Feet, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways free from Pain; a Swelling and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſs of the Breaſts; an immoderate Flux of the <hi>Lochia,</hi> and of Urine; Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driac or Hyſteric-like Affects; an inward Heat join'd with a Weakneſs, Faintneſs; and Loſs of Appetite: One or other of theſe, I ſay, are generally the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as often as this Fever, either by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its own Ill-nature, or <hi>bad Treatment of the Phyſician,</hi> makes an unhappy End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<note n="(g)" place="bottom">The Symptoms of the miliary Fever, in the Year 1741, were theſe; Shivering or Coldneſs, and Heat alternately; a Pain of the Head, Limbs; Back, like the Stone in the Kidneys; Belly, like the Cholic; Sickneſs, bilious Vomiting, Looſeneſs; Sinking of the Spirits, Oppreſſion at the Breaſt; a moiſt Tongue, little Thirſt; the Urine of an Amber Colour, like that of a Perſon in Health; a ſtrong, full, quick Pulſe at the Beginning, but three or four Days after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, weak, low, and ſwift; Delirium, <hi>Subſultus Tendinum,</hi> difficult Reſpiration; the Heat milder than in other continual Fevers.
<p>The Appearance of the Eruption, which was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the cryſtalline Kind, did not happen till the 14th, 15th, or 16th Days; which, I have now Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, would have appear'd ſooner, if it had not been retarded, by the bad Conduct of the Patient or Nurſe, or imprudent Treatment of the Phyſician.</p>

            <head>OF THE MILIARY FEVER.</head>
            <p>THE miliary Fever, ſo called from the ſmall red Eruptions that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble Millet-ſeed, is the moſt frequent in this Country of all the malignant Kind.</p>
            <p>The Patient often ſeems to himſelf at firſt only ſomewhat faint and indiſpos'd, his Strength and Appetite diminiſhed, and his Sleep interrupted, and his Dreams diſorderly and tumultuous, while he goes abroad and applies to his uſual Buſineſs, and hopes his Indiſpoſition will ſoon wear off, not ſuſpecting that he nouriſhes a malignant Fever in his Boſom. At length after about ſeven or eight Days, when he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0493500600:39"/>has taken to his Bed, by Means of copious and profuſe Sweats, the miliary Eruptions before mention'd appear in the Temples, the Neck and Breaſt, and ſometimes ſpread over the whole Body. If the Quantity be not great, as in the diſtinct Kind of the Small-Pox, they generally preſage a happy Event; but if they are very numerous, and cover the whole Surface of the Skin, then, like the Small-Pox of the confluent Kind, they are often fatal, and always dangerous; and they are in this too like that Sort of Small-Pox, that, as I have ſeen, in their Ripening, they ſometimes flow or run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to each other
<note n="(h)" place="bottom">There are, notwithſtanding, Phyſicians, who, to this Day, ignorantly preſage the happieſt Event, from the greateſt Quantity of Puſtles; of which I have often been an Ear-witneſs.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe little red Eruptions grow by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to Maturity, acquire white Heads full of Matter, and then grow dry, and die away; which Courſe, in the more kindly Sort, is generally accompliſh'd in ſeven
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0493500600:40"/>Days; but, in the worſt Sort, the Time is much farther protracted, and this happens alſo in the worſt Sort of Small-Pox; and it is very remarkable, that it ſometimes falls out, that in this Sort of Fevers, after one Eruption of a more malignant Kind has compleated its Courſe, and the Skin is clear'd of its putrid Crop, yet a ſwift, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Pulſe, great Drought and Want of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſhall continue, and the Phyſician may be aſſur'd, that either Death, or another Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<note n="(i)" place="bottom">(i) A ſecond Fever and Eruption, I likewiſe know, often ſucceed the firſt, but that is only when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient has been ill-treated, or when the Continuance of proper Medicines, for a ſufficient Time, has been obſtinately refus'd.</note> like the firſt is at Hand, to carry off the Matter of the Fever, which the firſt was unable wholly to perform: And this I have ſeen repeated the third Time, and even after that the Patient has recover'd, which but rarely happens.</p>
            <p>The great and profuſe Sweats, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the miliary Eruption, are by no Means
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0493500600:41"/>ſuch as critically diſcharge the Putrefaction that cauſes the Diſeaſe; but they ariſe from the violent Conflict and Agitation of the Blood, while the ſound and active Parts exert their Force, to digeſt and expel the Matter of the Diſeaſe; and therefore they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve oppreſs'd Nature, but ſink and weaken the Spirits by an exceſſive Evacuation
<note n="(k)" place="bottom">This brings to my Mind the Caſe of a Female Patient, who, at my firſt Viſit, I found drowning, if I may ſo ſay, in thoſe Sweats; with an interrupted Pulſe, and the Feet and Hands growing cold; at which, I preſag'd Death in a ſhort Time. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, being told, upon Enquiry, my Opinion, ſaid, He cou'd not ſee any Thing which had that Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, for that ſhe was in a <hi>fine breathing Sweat,</hi> and a moſt <hi>ſweet Sleep;</hi> but, <hi>fine</hi> and <hi>ſweet</hi> as they were, ſhe died in twenty-four Hours afterwards.</note>
; which however is neceſſary, that the putrid Parts may be excluded from the Blood by the miliary Eruptions that follow, in which conſiſts the critical Separation by which Nature is deliver'd, and the Blood recovers its healthful State; as it does by caſting out the Matter of the Small-Pox, at firſt complicated and entangled with the Maſs of Blood.</p>

            <p>Some Phyſicians, too fond of the <hi>cool Method</hi> in the Management of Fevers, from their Obſervation of the Uſefulneſs of that Conduct in inflammatory Diſtempers, ſuch as the Small-Pox, Rheumatiſms, Pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Quinſies, and St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Fire; have injudiciouſly extended it to the Cure of malignant Caſes, in which a conſiderable Quantity of the Blood is putrefied or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd by the Diſſolution or Separation of the Parts, as before deſcrib'd; but they ſeem not to act under the Guidance of Reaſon, but, in a mechanical Way of Practice, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the ſame Method of Cure to all Sorts of Fevers, tho' their Nature be ever ſo much diſtinguiſh'd. And hence it is, that theſe Gentlemen will not allow, that the miliary Eruptions are a regular Diſcharge of the Feveriſh Matter from the Blood; but, ſay they, they are the Effect of an unſkilful Conduct, in uſing Remedies of too hot a Nature, by which the Blood is put into too great a Hurry and Agitation : But this Aſſertion affronts all Reaſon and Obſervation.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0493500600:43"/>They may as well affirm, that the Small-Pox, Meaſles, and Scarlet Suffuſions, Boils, and Blanes, wou'd never appear on the Skin, were they not produc'd and exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Adminiſtration of too warm and active Remedies. I have often ſeen thoſe Eruptions break out in great Abundance, where the cool Method has been exactly obſerv'd; and of this every Practiſer may be ſoon convinc'd, if he carefully attends to the Growth and Progreſs of this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. In this, as in the Diſeaſes above-nam'd, the hurtful Matter, admitted into the Blood, is by Nature's Determination to be firſt concocted, and then ſeparated by the Strainers of the Skin, where being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, and not ſuffered to perſpire, it produces a miliary Harveſt; and a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, being but a <hi>Servant of Nature,</hi> ought to follow her Steps, promote her Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and not to turn her from her Path, and oppoſe her Operations
<note n="(l)" place="bottom">When the oppoſite Practice is made uſe of, by Miſtake, it is manifeſtly preductive of great Evils; as when, for Example, the miliary Fever is taken for an Intermittent; ſaline Draughts, ſucceeded by the Bark, are then not only confidently preſcrib'd, but the Practiſer without Heſitation declares the Danger entirely over, not knowing that he is at once giving a fatal Stab to his own Reputation, and his Patient's Life; for Death moſt aſſuredly, and to the Surprize of the Doctor, as well as all about the poor Sufferer, muſt ſoon cloſe the Tragedy.
<p>As when, likewiſe, that Fever is taken for a Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, the Stone in the Kidneys, or the Rheumatiſm, the ſame fatal Iſſue muſt be the Conſequence; with this Difference only, that, in theſe latter Caſes Death makes his Approach, more ſlow, but more terrible; for it is then not uncommon for an Abſceſs to be form'd in the Breaſt or Belly, or other lingering Diſorders to follow, which, together with an hectic Fever, at length, finiſh Life.</p>
                  <p>Some eminent and worthy Phyſicians, of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, know what I ſay to be true, becauſe they muſt be ſenſible how much they have ſuffer'd in their Reputations, by theſe fatal Miſtakes; particularly, by the Mal-adminiſtration of their <hi>ador'd Cortex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I could relate many Hiſtories of theſe tragical Events, but I think theſe Hints are alone ſufficient to mark out the dangerous Rocks, which lie in the Way to a ſafe Harbour.</p>

            <p>When a Patient has long ſtruggled with a Fever accompanied with Putrefaction, and, after twelve Days, no miliary Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0493500600:45"/>out are obſerv'd, it is uſual that ſmall wat'ry Bladders, from their Tranſparency, call'd cryſtalline, appear in the Temples, Neck, and Breaſt, which often gradually ripen, and become full of Matter; theſe perform the Office of the former Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by freeing the Blood of the noxious Ferment that diſturbs it, but not ſo ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectually
<note n="(m)" place="bottom">I muſt confeſs, that it is a Matter of Doubt with me, whether theſe Bladders do not rather <hi>only</hi> portend the gangrenous State of ſome Part of the Fluids, than that they are a critical Diſcharge of the noxious Matter; any more than the Veſications, which are uſual in Gangrenes of the Solids, free the diſeas'd Subject from the impending Danger, which, of Conſequence, threatens the Loſs of the Limb, Life, or both.</note>
.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerv'd, that there is a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which I call hypochondriacal or hyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teric, tho' it be not rang'd in the Claſſes
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0493500600:46"/>of that Diſeaſe by any Authors, as far as I know, that, by its Similitude to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Kind, often impoſes on Phyſicians, and induces them to believe that it is of that Sort. And this is the only true Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the Spirits, and which I have often ſeen. It imitates cloſely the malignant Sort in the greateſt Parts of its Symptoms, but it differs in this, that the Exerciſe of their Reaſon is not interrupted, or ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, during its whole Courſe, which runs out ſometimes to more than twenty Days; whereas moſt commonly the Head is much, if not chiefly affected, and the Faculties of Reaſon and Memory are greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb'd and broken, in malignant Fevers. Another Diſtinction is, that in the firſt Sort the Patient is not troubled with Looſeneſs, or Thruſh; nor do there ever appear in the Skin any miliary Eruptions, or Spots, of any Sort whatſoever. But on the contrary, in the laſt Kind, ſome putrefied Matter is always excluded from the Blood, and determin'd to the Skin, or ought to be ſo, if ſufficient Force remains in the Blood to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0493500600:47"/>effect: it
<note n="(n)" place="bottom">Or if the Intention of Nature be not revers'd by Mal-practice.</note>
. It is true, that in ſimple Fevers, where no Parts of the Blood are corrupted, there needs no critical Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by Sweats and Tranſpiration, which cool the feveriſh Flame, carry off the offenſive Matter from the Blood, and reſtore Nature to its regular Conſtitution; but, when many Parts of the Blood are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually mortified, how can Nature ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be reſtor'd to a healthful State, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expelling them to the Skin? Can a Gangrene in the ſolid Parts be heal'd till the ſound Fleſh be freed from the mortified Fibres? No more can the Maſs of Blood be cur'd, till it is clear'd and purg'd from its putrid and periſh'd Portions; which uſually muſt be done by excluding them from its Boſom by friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sweats, or lodging them in the Surface of the Body; I ſaid uſually, becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this putrid Matter may be diſcharg'd by the Glands or Strainers of the Guts, tho' that does not often happen; for frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0493500600:48"/>the Looſeneſs, that at the latter End at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends malignant Fevers, if the Patient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers, is taken up by a Thruſh or ſore Mouth; and hence it appears, that the hypochondriacal Fever, mentioned before, has not the eſſential Properties of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, and therefore does not ariſe from Putrefaction; tho' it is certain, that the malignant Kind have, at their Beginning, ſuch a Conformity of Symptoms and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances to hypochondriacal Paſſions, that it is difficult to diſcern, whether the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be attack'd by a putrid Fever, or an hyſteric Diſorder, or Perturbation of the Spirits: For Inſtance, Chilneſs, Shiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and rigorous great Inquietude, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings, Dejection of Appetite, Anxiety, Sickneſs, and immoderate Sweats, Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, a low weak Pulſe, Faintneſs, and great Diminution of Strength, are Symptoms common to both; and therefore for ſeveral Days a malignant Fever has ſo near a Reſemblance to one, that is only hyſteric, that many Phyſicians and Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders-by,

               <p>This Method, without Alteration, muſt be continu'd till Death, or a Recovery, turns the Scale; if Death ſhou'd take Place, I know of no better Method whereby to prevent it; but a Recovery will moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly enſue, if all Things, in this Stage of the Diſeaſe alſo, are faithfully and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manag'd; and then Security from a Relapſe depends, as I ſaid before, in keeping the Room, proper Diet, and a Continuance of the Boluſſes and Julep, Night and Morning, for a Week longer, when the Fever is gone off.</p>
               <p>If, in any Stage of the Diſeaſe, a Pain of the Head becomes very troubleſome, the Application of ſix or eight Leeches to the Temples will be not only abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but greatly advantageous; and ſo it will alſo be of Conſequence, at any Time of the Delirium.</p>

            <p>The wholeſale Apothecaries and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts are often the Sources of theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Diſaſters, who baſely ſophiſticate, for the Sake of a little Profit, Medicines which circulate not only through this Kingdom, but many foreign Countries, and deſtroy five Times more People, than wou'd die of Diſtempers in a <hi>natural</hi> Way; and the Druggiſts, whoſe Principles are little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for vending <hi>bad</hi> Drugs, excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by ſaying, <hi>If they buy the Devil, they muſt ſell the Devil;</hi> but, if the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries did not purchaſe him from Time to Time, they wou'd ſoon be tir'd with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him to Sale.</p>
            <p>When you have got <hi>good</hi> Medicines, I muſt then beſeech you to learn the <hi>Uſe</hi> of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0493500600:80"/>them; <hi>but hold!</hi> you muſt firſt learn the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> and know well how to diſtinguiſh one from another; I ſpeak chiefly to you <hi>young Ones,</hi> tho' the <hi>old Ones,</hi> many of them, wou'd not do amiſs to take my Advice: For this Purpoſe, ſearch out the beſt Authors, which will enrich your Senſes; read them over and over again, till their moſt remarkable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are ſtrongly impreſs'd on your Minds; but, in the mean time, abſtain from Wine, and other ſtrong Liquors, leſt they drown all your <hi>reaſonable</hi> Reflections, and hurt your Memory. Attend diligently the <hi>ſick Poor,</hi> as well as the <hi>Rich;</hi> for, tho' the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may beſt ſuit your Pockets, the former will ſerve you for experimental Knowledge, which in the End, if you have <hi>natural</hi> good Principles, will bring you more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, than the Mines of <hi>Mexico;</hi> but be eſpecially careful in your Experiments, that you do <hi>no Harm,</hi> for that ſhoud al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be your <hi>firſt Principle</hi> in Practice. Whenever you venture out of the <hi>beaten</hi> Track, or even follow the <hi>old</hi> one, go on
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0493500600:81"/>with Caution in giving <hi>ſmall</hi> Doſes of a <hi>doubtful</hi> Remedy, and be frequent in your Viſits to ſee the Effect of it; then proceed gradually Step by Step, and never quit the Diſeaſe, or the Remedy, till you are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of both. When a Phyſician attends your Patients, which you <hi>too often</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, from, I am afraid, a <hi>juſt</hi> Senſe of your own Inabilities, or to ſwell your Bill to a <hi>greater</hi> Bulk, don't think that your Buſineſs is <hi>then</hi> done, for it more nearly concerns you <hi>now</hi> to attend with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, as you have a greater Work ſet before you; now your timorous Mind is ſet at Liberty, to inſpect narrowly into the Nature of the Diſeaſe, the Remedies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd by the Phyſician, and to compare the Effects of them with your own Practice in the like Caſes. The <hi>exorbitant</hi> Fees of the Doctor will ſeldom admit of more than <hi>one</hi> Viſit a Day, and that at a Time when, in <hi>acute</hi> Diſtempers, the frightful but <hi>informing</hi> Symptoms of the Night are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther going, or chiefly gone off; therefore it is your Duty, if you have any Fellow-feeling
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0493500600:82"/>for your Patient, or Regard for yourſelf, to be conſtant in your <hi>Evening-Attendance,</hi> that thereby you may be ready the next Day to give a juſt Account of the Patient's Welfare or Sufferings, from the Diſeaſe and the Remedy, as well as to eſtabliſh yourſelf firm in that Opinion of the Sick, by your <hi>Diligence,</hi> which coud not be brought about by your <hi>Judgment alone;</hi> this will never fail from Time to Time to advance your Reputation, till your Age and Succeſs fix you on a more ſolid Foundation. But now preſents the <hi>diſmal</hi> Scene: To do all this, you muſt leave your darling Pleaſures, Taverns, and Bottle Companions, Play-houſes, Gaming-houſes, and other public Diverſions; to advance happily and ſucceſsfully in your Profeſſion, and to arrive at the Pinacle of univerſal good Character and Eſteem, you muſt forego all jovial Appointments, for the Sake, ſometimes, of one Patient only, and even that a <hi>poor</hi> one, to whom you muſt perhaps give your Advice and Medicines <hi>gratis;</hi> who, notwithſtanding that, has a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0493500600:83"/>
               <hi>Life</hi> at Stake, as valuable in his Station as that of an Emperor; for his Family are his loving Subjects, and his Cottage is his Kingdom, which muſt all droop and fall to Decay, after the Demiſe of their <hi>only</hi> King; therefore you muſt abſolutely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him as diligently as the Rich, leſt, by a Surmiſe of Neglect, you loſe more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in one Day, than you will be able to recover by the greateſt Diligence in many Months; eſpecially too, if you are but juſt tenter'd into Life: Do but ſucceed, tho' <hi>Nature</hi> does all, you will have all the Glory; but, if you miſcarry, Shame and Confuſion will be your Attendants, till, by Time and conſtant Rubbing, you are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently burniſh'd, to ſtand the Fire of a cenſorious Age: This is a long Leſſon, a <hi>hard Taſk;</hi> but be aſſur'd from me, that you will not have it in your Power to make any <hi>conſiderable</hi> Figure in your Profeſſion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the old Phraſe, <hi>till you have no Teeth to eat your Bread,</hi> without you purſue the Courſe I have laid down; except indeed, as ſometimes happens, you have the Luck
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0493500600:84"/>
               <hi>to have the Bread put into your Mouths,</hi> by ſome well eſtabliſh'd Practitioners, who take you into Partnerſhip in an <hi>early</hi> Age: This is the good Fortune of ſome remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Boobies,</hi> who, from not being able to get Shoes and Stockings, if they were ſet on their <hi>own</hi> Legs <hi>barefoot,</hi> begin ſoon to get an Eſtate; while others of Merit, Knowledge, and Succeſs, are oblig'd to trudge early and late, only for the Sake of a genteel Support.</p>
            <p>Now I have explain'd the Duty which more immediately concerns the Apothecary, I will give you farther Inſtructions for the Benefit of your Patients, which will not altogether be uſeleſs to yourſelves.</p>
            <p>Be ſure to keep a watchful Eye over the ſleepy <hi>ſenſeleſs</hi> Nurſes, ſuffer no Error or Neglect in their Conduct to paſs unregarded, as many of you do, to gain their Eſteem, and thence their Commendation, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to avoid their weak and low Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0493500600:85"/>and ungrounded Prejudices: Pay the ſame Deference alſo to the <hi>mighty knowing</hi> Midwives, who are only a better Sort of Locuſts, that will take the Bread out of your Mouths, if you do not ſmother their Errors, and proclaim their Qualifications; but mind this, you muſt be thorough-pac'd in your Profeſſion, and have given repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Proofs of your Judgment, before you make this hazardous Attempt, <hi>Nothing leſs than a forlorn Hope;</hi> for Women are, by a Sort of Infatuation, ſo exceſſive fond of this Sort of Creatures, who from thence take ſuch Liberties, that ſometimes even in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Caſes, they will, with an uncommon Stock of Impudence, tell you to your Face, in their Language, that <hi>ſure they have not been ſo many Years Nurſes or Midwives, but that they know what belongs to the Cure of ſuch and ſuch an Ailment, better than a young Apothecary.</hi> This you muſt irreſiſtibly oppoſe, and never leave them, till you have fairly prov'd that they are Fools and Lyars; otherwiſe, in Return, they will, much to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0493500600:86"/>your Diſadvantage, prove you to be a very <hi>ignorant Fellow,</hi> which will ſoon ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the neighbouring Women, your <hi>Body Guards;</hi> but then, I ſay, you muſt be conſcious that you certainly know how to vanquiſh the Diſorder, which has ſet you at Variance, or muſt come to a Parley up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on worſe Terms. But, leaving this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, condeſcend to examine the ſeveral liquid Foods you have order'd for your Patients Subſiſtence; be not content with one or two Sorts only, but have Plenty where it can be admitted, that the conſtant Supply which is neceſſary not only for the Diſeaſe, but from the Quality of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, may not nauſeate the Stomach, and rob you of Part of your Dependance in the Cure of the Patient; and indeed nothing contributes more to the Eaſe and Satisfaction of the Sick, than Choice of Liquors properly made; for weak Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs are ſoon diſguſted.</p>
            <p>As the Phyſician is often diſcharg'd, ſo ſoon as the Danger is over, the future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0493500600:87"/>of the Patient lies wholly upon your Care; therefore now is the Time to beſtir yourſelf, to procure a perfect Recovery, by continuing the Medicines order'd by the Phyſician; for at your Peril do not alter them, leſt by any Accident the Patient ſhoud grow worſe, and you incur the Blame; I ſay, continue the Medicines, as long they are abſolutely neceſſary, but <hi>no longer,</hi> and take upon you, with <hi>becoming</hi> Authority, to order the neceſſary Diet from Time to Time, and ſtrictly ſcrutinize into the Execution of your Orders; which will not only always gain the Attention and Eſteem of the whole Family, but convince them of your upright Intention to prevent a Relapſe.</p>
            <p>One Thing more I muſt add, and that is this, Revere the Profeſſion to which you belong, and treat every Member of it, who ſhall <hi>deſerve</hi> it, with the utmoſt Marks of Sincerity and Reſpect; be not reſerv'd, but with an <hi>engaging</hi> Air and Freedom, in your
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0493500600:88"/>mutual Correſpondence, communicate eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing you know for the public Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; <hi>let no good Thing be buried in the Grave, the Seat of Oblivion;</hi> be courteous and affable to all Mankind, eſpecially the <hi>ſick Poor,</hi> who, in their great Diſtreſs have little elſe to alleviate their Sorrows, than your ſympathizing Nature, mild Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and benevolent Hand; in ſhort, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways endeavour to act the Part of the <hi>real</hi> Gentleman, which, if you do not gain Riches, will generally procure you a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Mind, the next Step to a happy Life.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Requiſites, which, I have told you in my Preface, muſt be join'd with the Phyſician and his Preſcriptions, in order to a happy and ſucceſsful Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: But what with the <hi>Pride, Inability,</hi> and <hi>Self-conceit</hi> of <hi>many</hi> Phyſicians, the <hi>Negligence, Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Penury</hi> of <hi>many</hi> Apothecaries, <hi>Sophiſtication</hi> and <hi>Villainy</hi> of <hi>many</hi> Chymiſts and Druggiſts, I muſt, upon
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0493500600:89"/>the Whole, conclude, that we are, in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> in no proper Condition to make <hi>many great</hi> Advances or Improvements in Phyſick.</p>
