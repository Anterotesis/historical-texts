            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE favourable reception this little Piece has met with from the Public, demands my warmeſt acknowledgments: nor can I ſay too much of the ſupport it has received, both from the muſic, admirably adapted to the words, and the ſpirited and judicious performance of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral characters, which ſurpaſſed my moſt ſanguine wiſhes.</p>
            <p>The decorations, deſigned and executed in that ſtyle of elegant and characteriſtic ſimplicity which the ſubject requir'd, add greatly to the effect of the whole.</p>
            <p>The fable of this piece, taken from the book of Ruth; a fable equally ſimple, moral, and intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, has already furniſhed a ſubject for the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Epiſode of Palemon and Lavinia in Thomſon's Seaſons, and a pleaſing Opera of Monſ. Favart: of both I have availed myſelf as far as the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of my plan would allow; but as we are not, however extraordinary it may appear, ſo eaſily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with mere ſentiment as our more ſprightly neighbours the French, I found it neceſſary to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſify the ſtory by adding the comic characters of William and Phoebe, which I hop'd might at once relieve, and heighten the ſentimental caſt of the other perſonages of the drama.</p>
            <p>Some of the ſongs, and a few ſhort paſſages of the dialogue, (printed with inverted commas) though judiciouſly omitted in the repreſentation from the apprehenſion of making the Opera too long, are here reſtor'd, as tending to mark the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters with more preciſion.</p>

My comrades and I were croſſing the meadow, going home, when we ſaw them firſt; and hearing a woman, cry, I look'd up, and ſaw them putting her into a ſkiff againſt her will. Says I, Paddy, is not that the clever little <hi>crater</hi> that was <hi>glaning</hi> in the field with us this morning? "'Tis ſo, ſure enough," ſays he. "By St. Patrick," ſays I, "there's enough of us to <hi>reſcute</hi> her." With that we ran for the bare life, waded up to the knees, laid about us bravely with our ſhillelays, knock'd them out of the ſkiff, and brought her back ſafe: and here ſhe comes, my jewel.</p>

                  <p>Allow me to retire, brother, and learn at a diſtance from you to correct thoſe errors into which the fire of youth, and bad example, have hurried me. When I am worthy of your eſteem, I will return, and demand my rights in your affection.</p>

                  <p>You muſt not leave us, brother: the man who wiſhes to be virtuous is already become ſo. Reſume the race of honour; be indeed a ſoldier, and be more than my brother—be my friend. Dorcas, you have a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's right in Roſina, and muſt not leave us.</p>
