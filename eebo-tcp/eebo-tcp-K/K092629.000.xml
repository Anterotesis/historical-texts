            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Deſign of the following Pages, is to ſhew the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>COLLECTS, EPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STLES,</hi> and <hi>GOSPELS,</hi> from the firſt Sunday in <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,</hi> till <hi>Trinity-Sunday,</hi> have to their Reſpective Times and Seaſons; and what Connection and Agreement every <hi>COL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LECT, EPISTLE,</hi> and <hi>GOSPEL</hi> for the Sundays after <hi>Trinity</hi> till <hi>Advent,</hi> have among themſelves. And this, I hope, may be of ſome Service, not only as it is exceedingly delightful to the Mind, to conſider the Order, and Fitneſs, and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of theſe Offices, but as it will make them have that Eſteem and Regard paid them, they juſtly deſerve; as it will ſpeak clearly the Wiſdom of the Church in ſo compiling them; as it will inſtruct in a
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0235501400:5"/>due Knowledge of Times and Seaſons; and make them be a more <hi>Reaſonable Service,</hi> than they uſually are with the moſt of People.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Sparrow,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wheatley,</hi> in their excellent Treatiſes of the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> have both of them treated of this in the Sundays before <hi>Trinity.</hi> But then what they have wrote on this Subject, is lodged in a Book which is not eaſily got by thoſe, who will reap the greateſt Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from a Work of this Nature. I have therefore conſidered, in as narrow a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs as I conveniently could, both the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> before and after <hi>Trinity,</hi> in the Manner above mentioned. And this I have done not only from ſuch Hints and Paſſages of the Moderns, (particularly the two great Men above-mentioned) as give any but alſo from the ancient <hi>RI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUALISTS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope it will be no Fault, that it comes after ſo many much more valuable and learned Treatiſes on the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> as it aims at nothing more than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Ignorant in this Part of it, which as far as I know has not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been ſo publiſhed, as to be of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to them.</p>

And this is the Reaſon why the Office of our Lord's Advent, precedes the other Offices of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe his Coming in the Fleſh was prior to all the Tranſactions the other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were compil'd of.

                  <p>The EPISTLE does as it were point out the Coming of our Lord, not as at a Diſtance, but in haſt and immediately: <hi>The Lord is at Hand.</hi> How ſeaſonably therefore does it adviſe us, <hi>to Rejoyce in the Lord?</hi> As it were exhorting us to be chearful, becauſe of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s near and ſpeedy Coming into the World.</p>

For as on that Day we ſhall return to our former Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, ſo the Church, as an Emblem of it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats on the Octave, and the Days between the Feſtival and it, ſome of the firſt Days Office; thereby teaching us, that if we continue in the Worſhip of God, after being regenerated by Baptiſm, we ſhall on the Octave of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, after the ſeven Days of our Life have paſſed away, return to our firſt Purity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
                  <p>The EPITLE treats of our Saviour's Birth, and mentions the Advantages accruing to us from thence: That whereas before, the Church of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0235501400:21"/>God, <hi>like an Heir under Age, differed nothing from a Servant,</hi> being burthened with Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and the Obſervations of the Law; it was now by the Coming of his Son, arriv'd at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, and freed from thoſe Incumbrances, ſo that its Members <hi>are</hi> no more <hi>Servants;</hi> But Sons and Heirs of God, through Chriſt.</p>

               <p>THE Collect is very ſuitable, and full of Devotion, and begs of God, who by a Star, manifeſted his Son Jeſus to the Gentiles, to grant us after this Life, the Fruition of himſelf, whom we only know now by Faith.</p>

                  <p>THE Collect prays that we may have a right Knowledge of our Duty, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Strength to perform it.</p>
                  <p>The EPISTLE mentions the Things the Collect prays for, and is firſt an Exhortation to Mortification and Chaſtity: 2dly, to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of our Minds</hi> and thereby in Effect, to hope, Prayer and Obedience: 3dly, to Unity, <hi>as we are Members one of another.</hi> Now theſe three Things are the Virtues pointed out to us, by the Wiſe Men's Offerings. The <hi>Myrrh</hi> they offer'd ſignifies the Firſt; The <hi>Incenſe</hi> they offer'd ſignifies the Second; And the <hi>Gold</hi> they offered ſignifies the Third. How ſuitable then is this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to this Seaſon! For in the Goſpel for the <hi>Epiphany</hi> we have the <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> making their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0235501400:25"/>Offerings, and in this Epiſtle for the Sunday following, we are exhorted to imitate them.</p>
                  <p>The GOSPEL of this Day, is alſo very ſuitable to the Seaſon: For as this Sunday is the next after the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> ſo the Firſt memorable Action we meet with of our Saviour in his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Years, is this of his Coming up to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> at <hi>Twelve Years of Age,</hi> and diſputing with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors. At<note n="*" place="margin">Comber. in Catechiſ.</note> thirteen Years of Age, the Jews were wont to bring their Children to the Houſe of God, there to be publickly examined; and being then approv'd, they were then declared to be <hi>Children of the Precept,</hi> that is, obliged to keep the Law.

                  </p>
                  <p>IT is obſervalbe, that as from <hi>Chriſtmaſs to Epiphany,</hi> the Church in her Offices ſets forth Chriſt's Humanity, ſo from the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> to <hi>Septuageſima,</hi> ſhe ſets forth his Divinity.

Then the Biſhop commanded the Officers to turn them out of the Church Doors, and all the Clergy followed after, repeating that Curſe upon <hi>Adam, In the Sweat of thy Brows thou ſhalt eat thy Bread.</hi>

                  <p>THE Portion of Scripture for the Epiſtle is taken out of the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> and exhorts us to what the Collect prays for, <hi>viz. to turn to the Lord with all our Hearts, to faſt and weep, and mourn, and to rent our Hearts;</hi> And then to reſt aſſured, that the <hi>God of all Mercy will repent him of the Evil,</hi> and give us perfect Remiſſion and Forgiveneſs.</p>

                  <p>THE Collect is a Prayer to Chriſt, which ſhews the Church believes him to be God. It is very ſuitable to this Seaſon of Faſting and Abſtinence, and prays our Lord, that in Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Faſting <hi>forty Days and forty Nights,</hi>

                  <p>The GOSPEL is the Hiſtory of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's being tempted, and his Conqueſt over Temptations; and is therefore highly ſuitable for our Entrance on our ſpiritual Combat in this Seaſon of Lent, our great <hi>Day of Battle,</hi> as it emboldens and animates us with the Hopes of Victory againſt our ſpiritual Enemies.

                  <p>THE Collect after acknowledging from the Petition of the Woman in the Goſpel, <hi>viz.

                  <p>The EPISTLE exhorts us to avoid all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſs, and be ſtudious of Holineſs; which is undoubtedly very fit Advice at this Seaſon, when we are more particularly aſſaulted <hi>both outwardly in our Bodies and inwardly in our Souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The GOSPEL put us into the Method of obtaining what the Epiſtle perſuades us to, by giving us the Story of our Lord's Curing the Woman and <hi>Canaan</hi>'s Daughter that was vexed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0235501400:39"/>with a Devil. As ſhe by her ſteady Faith and earneſt Prayer, crying, <hi>Have Mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of</hi> David, <hi>and Lord help me,</hi> got the Devil thrown out of her Daughter; ſo may we, in like Manner, be diſpoſeſſ'd of the <hi>uncle all Spirit</hi> of Luſt and Incontinence.</p>

                  <p>AS the Seaſon of Pennance is thus far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, the Church is careful that her Sons ſhould not flag, but riſe in their Piety; and therefore the Epiſtle does not only perſuade us to <hi>avoid Fornication,</hi> and Sins of a deeper Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>but even fooliſh Talking and Jeſting, which are not convenient;</hi> both as they are unbecoming the Gravity of this penitential Seaſon, and are ſinful in their own Nature.</p>

               <p>IT is the higheſt of Feſtivals, as bringing us the comfortable News of our Lord's, and in due Time of our own Reſurrection. In the Seaſon before, the Church was in Mourning and Sorrow, an Emblem of the Troubles of the preſent Life; but now, on the Day of her Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Reſurrection, the Emblem of our future Happineſs in the Kingdom of Heaven, ſhe is in the compleateſt Joy. Whereas therefore it was always Cuſtomary in the primitive Times to be in Sorrow for the Seaſon of <hi>Lent,</hi> eſpecially in the <hi>Holy Week,</hi> when they beheld the <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and bewailed at the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and ſat weeping by the <hi>Sepulchre;</hi> it was now uſual to ſhew Tokens of the greateſt Joy, and therefore their morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salutation was, <hi>The Lord is Riſen,</hi> and the Anſwer was, <hi>The Lord is Riſen indeed,</hi> or, <hi>and</hi>

               <p>THE Collect having acknowledged that God through his Son his conquer'd Death, and ſet open to us the Heavens, prays, that the good Deſires of a Joyful Reſurrection, which are ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Grace, may by his continual Help be brought to good Effect.</p>
               <p>The EPISTLE directs us how to obtain what the Collect prays for, when it adviſes us, <hi>To mortifie our Members which are upon the Earth, and to ſet our Affections on the Things above; for if we be riſen with Christ, we muſt ſeek thoſe Things which are above.</hi>

                  <p>IN the primitive Times the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> was ſolemnized even till <hi>Whitſunday,</hi> in honour of our Lord's Reſurrection; afterwards the whole Week following was obſerved, which our Church approves of, by appointing a Preface in the Communion-Office for eight Days following;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0235501400:51"/>tho' ſhe hath only appointed an Epiſtle and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel for the Monday and Tueſday.</p>
                  <p>The EPISTLE gives and Account of our Saviour's Reſurrection from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who tells us, <hi>That he was raiſed up the third Day, that he was ſeen of them, whom God had choſen Witneſſes, and that they eat and drank with him after his Reſurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS Epiſtle is conveniently and judicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed before this Goſpel, as it contains the Words of <hi>Peter,</hi> who had the Honour of ſeeing his Lord, before <hi>the two Diſciples,</hi> or any of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>The GOSPEL is the Hiſtory of what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on the Afternoon of our Saviour's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>viz.</hi> his Walking to <hi>Emmaus</hi> with the <hi>two Diſciples,</hi> and his <hi>Diſcovering himſelf to them in the Breaking of Bread.</hi>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0235501400:64"/>and Confirmation; and is alſo very proper for the Practice of the Church, at the latter Part of the Week, the Time of faſting and praying for an holy and regular Miniſtry.

We may ſee therefore how agreeable this is to the Cuſtom of <hi>Ordaining</hi> at this Time; For it teaches us, that there is a Difference of Orders, becauſe there is a Difference of Power: <hi>Philip</hi> could <hi>baptize,</hi> but he could not <hi>confirm;</hi> which ſhews, that the Power of <hi>Ordaining</hi> (being at leaſt equally great with that of <hi>Confirming</hi>) can be lodged no where but in the Biſhop, or the higheſt Order. This Epiſtle then mentions <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,</hi> the Deſcent of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and laſtly inferrs the Validity of an <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Ordination,</hi> which is going to be performed at this Time, and ſo is highly ſuitable to the Seaſon.</p>

                  <p>The GOSPEL is the Hiſtory of the <hi>Ten Lepers.</hi> As our Lord was going to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they met him, and prayed him to cure them of their Leproſie: Upon which he told them, <hi>to go ſhew themſelves unto the Prieſts; and it came to paſs, that as they were going, they were cleanſed.</hi> For <note n="*" place="margin">Levit. <hi>iv. 2.</hi>

                  <p>The EPISTLE makes mention of ſome of thoſe good Works the Collect prays for, and thereby Anſwers to the <hi>Parable</hi> of thoſe who were bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the Marriage, and exhorts us to Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Meekneſs; telling us as it were, that when we are bidden to the Wedding, we ſhould behave with <hi>all Lowlineſs and Meekneſs, with long-ſuffering, forbearing one another in Love,</hi> not aiming at a <hi>Seat in the higheſt Room,</hi> as did the People in the Goſpel, <hi>but endeavouring to keep the Unity of the Spirit, in the bond of Peace.</hi>

                  <p>THE Collect prays for God's <hi>Grace to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil;</hi> and foraſmuch as the Goſpel tells us, <hi>That we muſt Love the Lord our God with all our Heart, and all our Mind,</hi> it therefore prays God, <hi>That with pure Hearts and Minds we may follow him the only God.</hi>
