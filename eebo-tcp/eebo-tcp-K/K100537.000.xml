            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Author of theſe poetical Attempts, begs Leave to ſay, that ſhe ſhould not have printed them, but that ſhe is precluded from all Hopes of ever ſeeing the Tragedy brought upon the Stage, by there having been two ſo lately on the ſame Subject. If her's ſhould be found to have any greater Reſemblance to the two repreſented, than the Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Story made unavoidable, of which ſhe is not conſcious, it muſt have been accidental on her ſide, as there are many Perſons, of very diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed Rank, and unqueſtionable Veracity, who ſaw her's in Manuſcript before the others appeared, and will witneſs for her, that ſhe has taken no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of having ſeen them. She muſt here do Mr. <hi>Criſp</hi> the Juſtice to ſay, that any Reſemblance muſt have been equally accidental on his part, as he neither did, nor could ſee her <hi>Virginia</hi> before his own was play'd;
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0800800400:7"/>
Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> having declined reading her's, till Mr. <hi>Criſp's</hi> was publiſhed.</p>
            <p>She is ſenſible of the Danger of appearing in Print, and of the many Imperfections in theſe Pieces; but hopes, her Sex, and the early Time of Li'e at which moſt of them were wrote, will plead her Excuſe; ſhe aſks no more, than to be read with the fame Candor and Indulgence with which ſhe herſelf reads the Productions of others.</p>
            <p>One thing more ſhe begs Leave to ſay, that ſhe was greatly encouraged to this Publication, by the favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reception three Odes of her's met with, which were inſerted in a weekly Paper called <hi>The Old Maid:</hi> as this Volume may poſſibly come into the Hands of Perſons who are Strangers to the Paper, ſhe has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed thoſe Odes with the others.</p>
            <p>And now, invoking the Powers for friendly Gales, ſhe ventures to launch her little Bark into the wide Sea of Criticiſm, and <q>Trembling quits the Shore.</q>
