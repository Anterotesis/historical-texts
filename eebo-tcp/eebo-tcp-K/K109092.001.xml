            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The COURT have wiſely reſolved to ſit without further adjournment, in order now to receive at their Bar, the evidence of the firſt POLITICAL, and LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERARY Characters, againſt whom, exceptions were ſo ingeniouſly taken by Council, but which however have all been moſt conſtitutionally over-ruled.

               <p>Your SHAKSPEARE correſpondents know but little of what is going forward in the <hi>mine of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very!</hi> Lord, Sir, if they wiſh to get at the <hi>whole truth,</hi> they muſt dip <hi>deep</hi> into the <hi>old cheſt,</hi> as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did into the <hi>Pierean</hi> well!—indeed they are not correct even in what they have ſtated. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,—the <hi>precious</hi> LOCK OF HAIR! how comes it, they were ſo ignorant, as not to know, that Mr. <hi>Juſtice</hi> COLLICK, the firſt <hi>Hair Merchant</hi> in the univerſe, has critically inſpected it, and, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the <hi>ſacred head</hi> of <hi>fiction</hi> from whence it was ſhorn, he, as a <hi>man of buſineſs,</hi> could only be brought to ſay, that if the whole <hi>ſtring</hi> were as good as the <hi>ſample,</hi> it was worth no more in the <hi>trade,</hi> than 3s. 9d. an ounce?—The pointed diſtich on the envelope, however, as his Grace of LEEDS declares, is worth a million!—Here it is:
<q>
                     <l>"Ere Age with twinge your nerves doth ſhocke,</l>
                     <l>"Catch Love, like Time, by the forelocke!"</l>

                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0537400801:11"/>
By which our annotators will no doubt tell us, that the <hi>Warwickſhire</hi> WAG quaintly inculcates the youthful libertiniſm of—<hi>catch, as catch can!</hi>—Among the more recent treaſures, are a moth-eaten <hi>under</hi> PETTICOAT, an undoubted <hi>original!</hi> Mr. MALONE, who, with all his ability, knows but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle about <hi>petticoats,</hi> ſays, this could be no part of the paraphernalia of the immortal Bard;—but Mrs. PIOZZI, and the whole <hi>Blue Stocking Club,</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidedly of a contrary opinion, and that for the beſt of all feminine reaſons; viz. becauſe Miſs HATH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AWAY, when ſhe became Mrs. SHAKSPEARE, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failed to <hi>wear</hi> the BREECHES!—we have alſo Mr. <hi>Boſwell's</hi> authority for this, amongſt other <hi>domeſtica facta</hi> of the Poet. The next curioſity for the <hi>amateurs,</hi> is, a <hi>love</hi> VALENTINE, ſurrounded, according to antient uſage, with <hi>hearts! cupids! doves!</hi> and <hi>darts!</hi> and in the centre, a <hi>typifying</hi> figure of a <hi>cock</hi> without a <hi>combe,</hi> (according to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique ſpelling) with this inexplicable <hi>anagram:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>"If to my armes you'll fondlye roame,</l>

From this, ſome of the inſpecting <hi>Literati</hi> are cruel enough to infer, that SHAKSPEARE muſt have had an <hi>intriguc</hi> with the daughter of his ancient enemy <hi>John a</hi> COOMBE,—the undoubted anceſtor of the preſent <hi>Oppoſition</hi> ALDERMAN, who has the honour of bearing that diſtinguiſhed name!</p>

               <p>Even Mr. STEEVENS admits the unqueſtionable authenticity of this valuable addendum to the <hi>cull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary art,</hi> by declaring, that Shakſpeare could not endure the <hi>ſtones</hi> of plumbs, which, from ſetting his <hi>teeth on edge,</hi> were called <hi>jar</hi> raiſins; and literally gives an appropriate citation of the following paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, from the Poet's <hi>own words,</hi> which will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be received as the beſt <hi>gloſſary</hi> to his <hi>own plumb pudding:</hi>

               <p>IT is with much concern we announce, that the PROCESSION, preparatory to opening the Literary Court of Inqueſt, to try whether this DRAMA is, or is not written by SHAKSPEARE, was obliged to be ſuſpended till Wedneſday by an unpleaſant acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. <hi>Signor</hi> DELPINI, that man of <hi>mighty mouth,</hi> who was to have walked as <hi>Champion</hi> to a PRODI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIOUS COURTIER, unfortunately diſlocated his <hi>jaw bone</hi> in practiſing an <hi>Ariſtocratic Grin,</hi> in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his illuſtrious Patron!—However, the <hi>Sieur</hi> FOLLET, almoſt equally great in the happy diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the human countenance, has kindly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken this intereſting part, and to be ready in it, that day at noon, when this introductory ſpectacle will certainly take place, and our readers be no longer kept in a ſtate of anxious expectancy!</p>
