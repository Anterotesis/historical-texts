            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE public has made ſo little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty hitherto, in ſwallowing nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous, or at beſt, inſipid verſes, when they have been wrapped up in agreeable muſic; that to offer a word, either by way of defence, or apology, for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing trifle, ſeems altogether unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
            <p>IT will be eaſily believed, that the author did not write it with a view to acquire the reputation of a genius: he muſt be a ſimpleton indeed, who hopes to give people an idea of his wealth by ſhewing them a handful of farthings. He wrote it merely to comply with the requeſt of a theatrical perſon, whom he had an inclination to oblige; it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0089200100:4"/>
and finiſhed in ſomewhat leſs than a fortnight; and his excuſe for now ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it to appear in print (and he really thinks ſuch an excuſe neceſſary) muſt be the nature of a muſical entertainment, which requires, that the words ſhould be put into the hands of the audience, who would otherwiſe find it impoſſible to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the performers in what they ſing upon the ſtage.</p>
            <p>HE is no ſtranger to the whimſical prejudice, which inclines moſt people to meaſure the worth of dramatic pieces by their length; and becauſe a muſical en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment is unavoidably the ſhorteſt of any, makes them, for that reaſon, deny its being capable of any degree of merit at all. But though what he here ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into the world, is neither a Tragedy, a Comedy, or even ſo much as a Comedy of two acts; he flatters himſelf, there are ſome few, who will not condemn it, merely becauſe it is not, what it was not
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0089200100:5"/>
deſigned for: he hopes they will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that when he ſat down to write it, he ſat down to write a muſical entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that a certain poet and critic, who is allowed to have been a tolerable judge in ſuch matters, has told us, no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor can compaſs more than he intends.</p>
            <p>IF after this, any perſons have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to find fault with it, they are heartily welcome: nay, he will ſo far ſubſcribe to their opinion, as to confeſs, there are ſome as bad lines in it, as the worſt dablers in ſing-ſong ever were guilty of; but he thought it needleſs to correct them, as every thing of this kind muſt be caſtrated, in order to make it perfectly muſical; and ſtretched and altered, to fit the ſhape of the ſtage. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he would certainly point out the exceptionable lines, to ſhew he is not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of them; but that he takes it for granted, there will be people enough ready to ſave him that trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0089200100:6"/>THUS far by way of Preface; which the author has written, only becauſe he is aſſured there is nothing ſo acceptable to the purchaſers of any thing in the form of a book, now a-days, as a reaſonable pennyworth in print and paper; and he had a mind to avail himſelf of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages attending an additional half-ſheet.</p>
            <p>FOR the ſame reaſon too he might poſſibly have attempted a Dedication; but, unfortunately, the only perſonages likely to patronize his performance are united in a particular ſociety; and he was at a loſs in what manner to order their titles, ſo as to make a proper blazon at the head of a page. However, in this place he would be underſtood to inſcribe the following rhimes to thoſe vagrant choireſters, who, like the bards of old, ſing verſes about the public ſtreets; and if, when they
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0089200100:7"/>
have thought proper to advance the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ballads to a place in the <hi>Chimney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweeper's Garland,</hi> the <hi>Sweetheart's Delight,</hi> or any other of their ingenious collections; they ſhould, (thro' their novelty, and the prevailing argument of playhouſe tunes) be the means of rendering more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in their demands, thoſe grinders of the muſes, who have the conſcience to expect ſix and thirty pretty ſongs in one book for a halfpenny; he ſhall think the time, and pains they coſt him in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, very well beſtowed.</p>
            <p>TO conclude. The author thinks there is no doubt, on account of the muſic, which is admirable; and the performance, which will be excellent; but this little piece muſt come off well upon the ſtage; but after having been acquitted there, he foreſees, ſome buſy people will be for bringing it before the judges in the court of criticiſm. Now he applies himſelf
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0089200100:8"/>
to the ſaid judges, requiring them to conſider all ſuch proceedings as arbitrary, at leaſt, if not unprecedented: He deſires, that they will ſuffer the inſignificancy of this piece, to ſcreen it from their cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance; and that they will not attempt to break a butterfly upon a wheel.</p>
