            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>SAUL,</hi> for his Diſobedience to Heaven, is afflicted with the Fiend of <hi>MELANCHOLY, p. 1. DAVID</hi> is ſent for, to cure him by the Power of Muſic, <hi>p. 2.</hi> He comes, attended with a Choir of Shepherds; and, as the means of diſpelling <hi>SAUL'S</hi> Deſpair, he ſings the Creation of the World, and the happy Eſtate of our firſt Parents in Paradiſe, <hi>p. 3 to 7. SAUL</hi> is moved by the Repreſentation; but expoſtulates with <hi>DAVID,</hi> "why, when others are happy, He ſhould be miſerable," <hi>p. 7. DAVID,</hi> to convince him that Guilt is the Source of Miſery, ſings the Fall of Man, and his Expulſion from Paradiſe, <hi>p. 8.</hi> This alarms the Monarch's Pride; and inſtead of reclaiming, provokes him to Reſentment and Rage, <hi>p. 9. DAVID,</hi> ſuperior to his Threats, awakens his Conſcience, and terrifies him, by ſinging the Fate and Puniſhment of Guilt, in the Deſtruction of the rebellious Tribe of <hi>CHORAH</hi> by an Earthquake, and of the guilty World by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Deluge, <hi>p. 10. SAUL,</hi> ſtruck with Horror, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to kill himſelf, <hi>p. 13.</hi> But being prevented by his Friends, <hi>DAVID</hi> ſooths his Anguiſh, by invoking Repentance and divine Mercy to compoſe his Paſſions,
<pb facs="tcp:1205900200:3"/>
               <hi>p. 14. SAUL</hi> relents into virtuous Sorrow, <hi>p. 15.</hi> But his Deſpair returning, <hi>DAVID</hi> calls on his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant Choir to raiſe a more ſublime and affecting Strain, <hi>p. 16.</hi> This hath its Effect; and <hi>SAUL</hi> melts into Tears of Penitence, <hi>ib. DAVID</hi> now comforts him with the Return of the divine Favour, <hi>p. 17.</hi> To baniſh the Remains of Pride, he then ſings his own Happineſs in the humble Station of a Shepherd, <hi>ib.</hi> Still farther to compoſe the Monarch's Griefs, by a Strain of ſoft Muſic he throws him into a gentle Slumber; invoking celeſtial Viſions to tranſport him to the Regions of the Bleſſed, and change his Anguiſh into Joy, <hi>p. 18.</hi> The deſired Effects appear in his Countenance: The Fiend departs: And <hi>SAUL</hi> awakes in perfect Tranquillity, <hi>p. 19. DAVID</hi> then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with a Song of Triumph on the Powers of Harmony, and the ſeraphic Hymn that attended her, as the Miniſter of Heaven, on the Creation of the World, <hi>p. 20.</hi>
