            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
CONDUCT
Of ſome People, about
Pleading Guilty.</head>
            <p>WHEN the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi>
firſt exhibited Impeachments
againſt the Seven Lords taken
at the Defeat of the Rebels at <hi>Preſton,</hi>
and ſent the Articles againſt them up to
the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> the Lords, according
to the uſual Courſe of Proceedings in
ſuch Caſes, appointed the Impeach'd
Lords to attend, and allow'd them Time
to give in their Anſwer.</p>
            <p>While this Part was depending, it was
the common Diſcourſe of the Town,
That giving them Time was but a piece
of needleſs Formality, a kind of Banter
upon their Circumſtances, a Thing of no
ſignification, that indeed it gain'd them a
few Days to Live, and to prepare for
another World, which was the only
Thing they ought to have in their View,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0147400900:3"/>
but that it was of no other effect, <hi>For
what can they Plead?</hi> ſaid the People,
who ſpoke of thoſe Things with any
Judgment, <hi>Were not they taken in Arms?
Were they not in open Rebelion, and made
Priſoners in the Action, Surrendered at
Diſcretion to our Generalls, and brought
immediately bither from the very Place of
Battle? Can ſuch Men bring any Plea?
What can they have to ſay?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' this was the Diſcourſe without
Doors, yet with the Perſons themſelves
there was other Thoughts; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
with their Friends; and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
that happened upon this Subject, as
well among themſelves as among other
People, may be very Uſeful for us to
know ſomething of, as well to let us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Secret Hiſtory</hi> of their <hi>Conduct,</hi> as
to inform us who were in their Intereſt,
and upon what Foot their Friends En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to Save them.</p>
            <p>I believe no Man will ſuppoſe, that
Gentlemen of ſuch Quallity as theſe,
were without ſome Friends, who, in
their preſent Extremity, would Intereſt
themſelves for them, and who Apply'd,
with the uttermoſt Diligence, to gain to
them the Favour of ſuch other Perſons,
as might be ſuppoſed, on any Account
whatever, to be capable of Serving them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0147400900:4"/>
It was eaſie to ſee who would Befriend
them of Courſe; (<hi>viz.</hi>) Thoſe engaged
by Party, who were on their Side by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
theſe were not only to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
upon for their Votes in favour
of the Gentlemen in Diſtreſs, but to be
moved to uſe their Intereſt for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others, of a Second Party, who were
ſomething Indifferent, over to the ſame
Sentiment. There was a Third Party,
from whom nothing was Expected, and
therefore to ſuch little Application was
to be made, but they were, if poſſible, to
be Out-Number'd.</p>
            <p>The ſpace the Criminal Gentlemen
had between their Commitment to the
<hi>Tower,</hi> and the Day of their Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
was the Time to be employ'd to
form thoſe Intereſts, and to come to an
Underſtanding about the Strength of
their Friends; and as there were no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be loſt, ſo neither was it ill
Employ'd; they took care to Sollicit,
Treat with, and Engage every Man, that
by any poſſible Methods they could come
at, to act in their Intereſt, in ſo Critical
a Juncture, and to do their Beſt for them,
if poſſible to avert the Stroke of Juſtice
at laſt; and for this no Body can blame
them. It was not many Days before the
Impeachments, that we were told, with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0147400900:5"/>
great Aſſurance, That the Lords in the
<hi>Tower</hi> had made ſuch an Intereſt, that
they were under no apprehenſions of
Dying at all, and that it only remain'd,
to Determine what Method ſhould be
taken, to make the Mercy they were to
receive appear Rational in thoſe that
Granted it, and be Satisfactory to the
Nation.</p>
            <p>And if it is True, that they had, upon
thoſe Applications, ſome private Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
given them, That by the ſtrength
of their Intereſt among the Nobility, the
whole Houſe of Lords would be brought
to Addreſs His Majeſty to ſhew them
Mercy, who can blame them for promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
themſelves their Lives, eſpecially
conſidering the native Clemency of His
Majeſty, and the Inclination all good
Kings have to ſpare the Blood of their
People.</p>
            <p>But in all theſe Meaſures, there has
been ſo much Intriegue, ſuch Nicety of
Management, ſuch Subtilty of Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſuch Induſtry uſed on one
Hand, and ſuch Court Fineneſs, ſuch
diſcovery of Perſons and Principles on
the other, that it muſt be very Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
as well as Improving, to give ſome
Account of it to the World.</p>
            <p>The Meaſures, as I have ſaid, having
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0147400900:6"/>
been taken to form their Intereſt, and
thoſe Meaſures having ſucceeded, even
beyond their Expectation, the firſt thing
to be obſerv'd is, How agreeable to all
good Men, and eſpecially to Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Quality, it is to be apply'd to
for ſhewing Mercy to Men in Diſtreſs,
in a Court ſo Gallant, ſo Soft, ſo Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
I had almoſt ſaid ſo Chriſtian, as
that of this Kingdom, what wonder is it,
that an humble Application, by Perſons
of Honour under Misfortunes, found
powerful Advocates, and made ſenſible
Impreſſions upon the Minds of ſome
Great Perſons in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Clemency and Charity are the Glory,
the one of Nobility, the other of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
and when theſe are the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Arguments to be uſed, when theſe are
the Keys, how eaſy is it to Unlock the
Breaſts of ſuch Perſons who are fill'd
with Principles of Honour and Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?
I had much rather give theſe for
the Reaſons, why the Applications of the
Diſtreſſed Lords gain'd them ſo eaſie, and
ſo general an acceſs to the Hearts of
ſome, whoſe Poſts and Truſts, perhaps,
might ſeem to have Engaged them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way; and of whom it might have
been expected, that their Concern for
the Safety and Peace of their Royal
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0147400900:7"/>
Maſter, the Honour of His Government,
and the Good of their Country, ſhould
have open'd their Eyes to the neceſſity
of Publick Juſtice at that Time, than
have it to ſay of any, That it rather
opened their Ears to the Petitions of
thoſe who had put their Hands to the
horrid Work, of their Country's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
and made them Interceſſors
for thoſe who had rais'd a Civil War in
its Bowells, ſtriking at the Perſon and
Family of our Sovereign, the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Proteſtant Intereſt, and at
the very Root of the Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>I am very loth alſo to entertain an
Opinion ſo groſs in it ſelf, and ſo remote
from Charity, which nevertheleſs ſome
have ſtarted, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That it was liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a frailer part of their Inclination,
which brought ſome Gentlemen into
this Matter: That all the Clemency of
their Tempers, and Softneſs of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
would not have prevail'd over
their Senſe of Duty, if there had not
been more glittering Motives, whoſe
Power they had not ſelf-denying Vertue
enough to reſiſt; Tho' if this was their
Temptation, I muſt ſtill acquit the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors,
I mean the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi>;
for who, in their Circumſtances, would
have ſpar'd their Ammunition where
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0147400900:8"/>
knew the Fort would be reduc'd by Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining,
without the hazard of Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
            <p>And
as on the one Hand I believe, at
leaſt hope, this is no more than a Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
upon the Gentlemen, of whom it is
ſpoken, ſo, I dare ſay, the Reaſons ſome
People have to ſuggeſt ſuch a thing, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to themſelves, are rather taken from
what they have formerly heard, of the
influence MONEY has had upon thoſe
Perſons in Times paſt, to lead them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Principle, than from any real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
they have now had of the
Fact.</p>
            <p>It may be True, that the Suſpicion is
encreaſed by the Knowledge the World
has had of the contrary Diſpoſition of
the Perſons ſpoken of in Days of old,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) How, in former Times, when the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of Publick Affairs has been
in ſome of their Hands, they have been
found as Deaf to the Importunities of
the Miſerable, as Inexorable to ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
Vertue, and diſtreſs'd Innocence,
as any <hi>Aſian</hi> Mute, commiſſion'd to the
excerciſe of the Bow-String: How they
have been Eminent for vindictive Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and the Operations of the Spleen,
as any that have ſince acted their Parts;
and therefore it has been ſaid, That it
muſt be from ſome other Principle than
that of Humanity and Compaſſion, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0147400900:9"/>
thoſe Perſons, however Great, ſhould be
prevail'd with to plead for Clemency
and Mercy to Men under the worſt of
Circumſtances, and Sentenc'd for Crimes
which muſt neceſſarily, not only taint
their Honour and Families who are
Guilty, but muſt caſt ſome juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
upon thoſe who Intereſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Save them. But as thoſe are
but Suggeſtions, I ſay no more of them.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Fact, as it ſtands
Hiſtorically in our view: Certain it is,
<hi>if Fame lye not,</hi> That the powerful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
for Mercy for theſe Men,
whether by the influence of the Ladies
Tears, the ſenſe of the Misfortunes of
ſo many Perſons of Quality, or any
meaner Importunities, <hi>I cannot ſay,</hi> had
found Means to make Impreſſions upon
ſome nearer the Throne than they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
had, I believe, any hopes of; and
as this was an agreeable Surpiſe to the
Unfortunate Gentlemen, ſo we ſhall ſee
the leſs Reaſon to wonder at their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Conduct on that Account, and this
is partly the Reaſon why I have entered
into this Part at the Beginning of this
Tract.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more Certain, than that
before this the Lords ſeeing little room
to expect any Intereſt could be made for
their Eſcape, had entertain'd ſerious
Thoughts of Dying, and were rather
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0147400900:10"/>
ſomething Diſconcerted, than otherwiſe
Determined, as to what Anſwer they
ſhould give to the Impeachments which
were brought againſt them.</p>
            <p>Indeed, as ſome of them Expreſs'd it,
<hi>I mean one already Executed,</hi> they hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expected the Houſe of Commons
would have given themſelves the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Impeachments, in a Caſe which
was ſo plain, and requir'd ſo little Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
but rather have let the Law take
its ordinary Courſe, by Indictment and
Plea, and have left them to the Houſe
of Peers, who muſt neceſſarily have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
them.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid alſo, by ſome of their
Party, That the ſame Gentlemen had
reſolv'd to act what they call <hi>the Heroe,</hi>
(<hi>viz.</hi>) To have given the Fact in Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
at their Tryal, and juſtify'd the
Rebellion upon Principles of <hi>Jacobitiſm</hi>;
the Foundations of which, <hi>like Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Tenets in Religious Diſputes,</hi> are
not fit to be Mentioned. That this had
been to have acted the Deſperadoe, and
to have caſt themſelves entirely away
beyond the reach of Mercy, and out of
the Power of Interceſſors; nay, even
out of the Rational Power of the Royal
Clemency itſelf, is moſt certain; how
it could Denominate them <hi>Heroes</hi> would
have been their buſineſs to ſhew, I muſt
acknowledge I do not ſee any thing of
that kind in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0147400900:11"/>
However, we found this Notion was
ſo revitted in the Mind of one Perſon, if
of no other of them, that nothing could,
for ſome time, divert his Thoughts from
it; and we have divers Accounts of his
Conduct in that Part. How he talk'd of
Death, <hi>a la Cavalier</hi>: How he made the
Scaffold appear to his Fancy, no more
than a Scene in a Tragedy, which had
nothing in it but a Formality, to make
his paſſing off from the World a little
Judicial. How he thought that Death
there, could have no worſe a Face than
it had in the Streets of <hi>Preſton,</hi> where he
had look'd on its Phyz with very little
Apprehenſion, and was not at all afraid
to ſee it again.</p>
            <p>As theſe were the Views which for
ſome time theſe Gentlemen had, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were they eaſy to be brought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
other Notions; Indeed when the
Time was Limited, that they were Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to give in ſome Plea or other, and
that they began to look on the Thing
with a nearer, and, perhaps, a more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
View, they appear'd not all alike
Determind'd; but all the Conſequence of
this was, That it only made them a little
more encliin'd to liſten to the Advice of
their Council and Friends, and to Act
by ſuch Meaſures as Reaſon, and the
Nature of their Circumſtances call'd for.</p>
            <p>This ended in their Pleading Guilty
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0147400900:12"/>
to the Impeachment, and throwing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
in the moſt Moving and Submi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Manner poſſible, upon the King's
Mercy, imploring the Interceſſion of their
Peers, who were their Judges, and of the
Commons, who were their Accuſers, a
thing which, as is ſaid, One of thoſe
now gone ſaid, <hi>Was much more difficult</hi> to
do, <hi>than</hi> TO DIE.</p>
            <p>I have heard many wiſe and good Men
ſay, That let the Ends, which the ſaid
Gentlemen propoſed to themſelves in it,
be what they would, that Plea was the
only Step they could have taken, entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to give Peace to their own Minds, and
have good Men believe they were reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to an honeſt and juſt Principle; <hi>The
Firſt,</hi> becauſe by it they had tryed the
only Step left them to ſave their Lives,
and which they could not poſſible be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſatisfy'd in omitting; and <hi>the Laſt,</hi>
becauſe the Contrary had been a juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and defending the Crime of Rebellion,
which on no juſt Principle could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;

            <p>N. O. <hi>But they may plead Guilty in
General Terms; they acknowledge they
were in Arms, marched ſo and ſo, and were
taken in Fight, as the Impeachment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes

Pleading Guilty then is no more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing

a little moved at that Propoſal,
and with ſome Warmth replyed, <hi>But,</hi>
my Lord, <hi>do you conſider the very</hi> Plea
<hi>is a Renouncing my Sovereign: How can
a Man of Honour ſtoop to that? Nay,
how can any Man of Honour offer ſuch a
Thing to us?</hi> (ſays <hi>L. R.</hi>) <hi>My Lord, your
Lordſhip knows that</hi> N. O. <hi>was always a
ſincere Friend to the Chevalier; he bid me
aſſure you that he is ſtill ſo in his Heart:
You know he gave innumerable Evidences
of it formerly, in the Time of his Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration;
and if he has ſeemingly appear'd
in another Intereſt now for ſome Time, you
know well the Motives inducing, and alſo
that it is with due Reſerves, and that he

Do you conſider that it is Perjury in the

have no Diſpenſation for breaking lawful</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0147400900:17"/>

               <hi>L. R.</hi> told him, He could not ſay <hi>how

Foot hitherto; and I think a Man of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

               <hi>L. R.</hi> ſeem'd at a full Stop at this, as
indeed any Proteſtant might well be,
and as if the Caſe was at a Point, reply'd,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0147400900:18"/>
That he could not enter into a Diſpute
about Opinions, and Principles: <hi>But,</hi>
ſays he, <hi>if this cannot be, then I beg your
Lordſhip will tell me if I can ſerve you any
other way.</hi>
            </p>

               </hi> not willing ſtill to
to quit the Diſcourſe, replied with this
Queſtion: <hi>Why may not the Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe
for Mercy to us after a Tryal, if
we are found Guilty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This diſcovered his full Deſign: But
<hi>L. R.</hi> open'd the Caſe more fully to his
Satisfaction, as follows: Says he, <hi>All that
are your Friends now, will, no doubt, do
ſo, my Lord, but the Buſineſs lies another
Way: It muſt not be a few Friends, but a
Majority of the Houſe that can do you any
Service; and do you not think there will
be a manifeſt Difference in the Inclination
of the Peers to you, from the Influence of
your Conduct, and as you behave well or
ill?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lord <hi>D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi> ſeem'd not to underſtand
him, and deſir'd him to explain himſelf.</p>
            <p>Why, ſuppoſe, (<hi>ſays</hi> L. R.) on one Hand
you plead <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> juſtify your ſelves
from your Loyalty, <hi>as you call it,</hi> to the
Chevalier, which, by Conſequence, muſt be
in the higheſt manner provoking to the
preſent Government, as it inſiſts upon the
Title of their Enemy, and pretends to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
the Settlement here: Do you think,
my Lord, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> as many will incline to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0147400900:19"/>
Compaſſion, and as many will think you
merit to be ſpar'd, as will be mov'd on the
other Hand to a generous Clemency, when
they ſee ſo many unhappy Noblemen throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves entirely at their Feet, and
Imploring their Interceſſion for unfortunate
Men, who cry for Mercy. Pray conſider
this Caſe ſedately, my Lord.</p>
            <p>Perhaps indeed (ſays my Lord) there
may be ſome Difference in that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A great deal, my Lord,</hi> (continued <hi>L.
R.</hi>) <hi>and there are a great many Reaſons
for it: We are to work upon Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in this Caſe, not upon Party Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
If the Houſe were to go by Party,
you are loſt: You muſt not think that all
thoſe who may be brought to pity you, are
of your Side; if they were, it were no
matter how you pleaded: But we are to
move the Compaſſions of Men to your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who are Enemies to your Cauſe; and</hi>
with ſuch <hi>differing Meaſures muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
In a Word, my Lord, I muſt own, it

            </p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

yield, and that he was convinc'd by theſe
Reaſonings, return'd thus: <hi>Well, and if I
do plead Guilty, what will he do for me?
And what muſt I do elſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Why, my Lord,</hi> (ſaid <hi>L. R.</hi>) <hi>if you plead

               <hi>And muſt I call him King and Majeſty?</hi>
(ſays L. <hi>D.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It muſt be ſo, my Lord,</hi> (ſays <hi>L. R.</hi>)
<hi>there can be no putting in a Word for you,

and your Lordſhip knows it to be ſo as

If I can ſtoop to ſuch mean Things to ſave

            </p>
            <p>Says L. <hi>R. I ſee, my Lord, the Nicety
of Honour will be your Deſtruction; I am

for the Injury ſuch an Obſtinacy will be
to the reſt of the Noble Lords who are
your Fellow-Priſoners, who, I fear, will
fare the worſe for it.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>You ſtab me with that Expreſſion</hi>; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
my Lord <hi>D. rather than they ſhall

            <p>
               <hi>L. R.</hi> told him, He knew that Thought
would touch his tender Part; that it
was indeed a Reflection which any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

that it was hard to let our Opiniatre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger

To this, Lord <hi>D.</hi> as if yielding, ſaid

               <hi>Yes, yes, my Lord</hi>; (ſays L. <hi>R.</hi>) <hi>you

do often make, or paſs Acts of Oblivion,
yet in Caſes thus particular, we do not find
often that the Houſe relents. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
are the Accuſers, and are juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd
at the Rebellion; and they cannot
ſo reaſonably concern themſelves to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

to addreſs in your Favour.</hi>

its better to come there gallantly, and with

He ſpoke this with great Earneſtneſs,

            <p>By ſuch Arguments as theſe, and by

ſtirr'd for them, who thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for their Safety, the Lord <hi>D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Meaſures which he publickly Repented
of, when he found them ineffectual.</p>
            <p>How far both they, and their Friends
alſo, were miſtaken in their Meaſures,
we ſhall take Notice of by and by.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary to Obſerve here, That
after theſe Things were over, and the
Priſoners had Pleaded Guilty, ſpoken
very handſomely, and Submitted in the
loweſt Manner to the Peers, begging their
Lordſhips to Interpoſe with His Majeſty
for Mercy to them, as by their Speeches,
which are made publick, and to which I
refer, may be ſeen; I ſay after this was
over, then the Moments ſeem'd to be
come, in which the Promiſes of <hi>N. O.</hi>
and other their Friends, were, if ever, to
be performed.</p>
            <p>The Ladies, with all the moſt Moving
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0147400900:24"/>
and Paſſionate Repreſentations, acted their
Part to perfection: None can ſay, They did
not do their Duty to the utmoſt; the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
Intereſt they made among all the Men
of Influence, ſhew'd they were not wanting:
All that Prayers and Tears could do, was
done without Doors; at length the Petition
was brought into the Houſe of Lords, and
being Receiv'd, it introduced a Debate.</p>
            <p>I am not allow'd to take notice of any
Thing that was Tranſacted within the
Houſe, other than by Generals, to wit,
That their Friends did all that could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
of them, and that it was poſſible to
do; and ſo far has Clemency, and a Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Diſpoſition, the aſcendant over the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Perſons who compoſe that Illuſtrious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that thoſe Lords who ſpoke in Favour of
the Condemn'd Lords, had great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
few caring to interpoſe, to put a ſtop
to the Royal Goodneſs, or obſtruct the
Channel of Mercy to the Miſerable.</p>
            <p>This, we may ſuppoſe, favour'd their
Petition; and the Lords agreed to addreſs
his Majeſty for Mercy, with ſuch a Reſerve
to his Majeſty's Pleaſure and their Conduct,
as might tell them however, that there
was yet ſomething farther to be look'd for
from them, if they expected Mercy: How
this was expreſs'd, is to be ſeen in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,
to which we refer.</p>
            <p>The Condemn'd Lords, it was ſaid, did
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0147400900:25"/>
not receive the News of this Addreſs with
that Pleaſure that their Friends, who ſaw
not ſo far into it as ſome of them did, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
which, perhaps, was the Reaſon why
one ſaid of them too warmly, That they
were not grateful to their Friends.</p>
            <p>Nor did they receive it all alike, ſome
who penetrated into Things farther than
others, ſeeing, perhaps, Room for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
in it, and others juſt the contrary;
ſo that while this Addreſs put ſome of
them in Hopes that they might <hi>Deſerve</hi>
Mercy, and conſequently have room to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it, others of them ſaw room only to
deſpair this <hi>Deſerving Mercy,</hi> being a Term
which they had different Notions of from
other Men.</p>
            <p>It began now to appear to them, that they
were deceived, when they thought that
<hi>The Bitterneſs of Death was paſt</hi>; That the
Peers, tho' they were prevail'd with to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
ſome merciful Diſpoſitions towards
them, were very far from offering to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
upon the Government, or to preſs for
Mercy, but on ſuch expreſs Terms as his
Majeſty ſhould find to be for the Honour
of his Government, and the Safety of his
Kingdom: So that it remain'd for theſe
Gentlemen to convince his Majeſty, that
they were proper Objects of Mercy, before
they could comfort themſelves much from
what was paſt.</p>

                  </gap>r,</hi> tho' it does not ſpeak it
in Words, yet intimates very plainly, That
there has been a long Train of Treaſons;
a ſecret Management of Parties and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in the Preparing the late Rebellion,
and Concerting Meaſures for it; and that
there appeared a great Deſire in ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to have it out; and, no doubt, it is
the true Intereſt of the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to diſcover thoſe Things; and the
Diſcovery whereof might indeed contribute
to the Preventing more of theſe unhappy
Gentlemen coming into like Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with theſe, and ſo, in Effect, be of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to their Friends: That theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were privy to, and partly in thoſe
Treaſons, there is little Reaſon to queſtion;
what elſe can be the Meaning of the Words
in the Lord <hi>Der<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi> Speech, that <hi>Some</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0147400900:27"/>
               <hi>Means have been propoſed to me for Saving
my Life, which I look'd on as inconſiſtent
with Honour and Conſcience, and therefore I
rejected them.</hi> It is evident then that he
was able to have complyed with the means
propoſed, otherwiſe it would have been a
Prevarication to ſay, That <hi>Therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
them</hi>; if he had been uncapable to
have complyed, if he had not been in the
ſaid Train of Treaſons, if he had not been
able to make Diſcoveries, he could with
more Truth, and much more to his own
Vindication, have ſaid, that it was not in
his Power, and that <hi>therefore</hi> thoſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals
were ineffectual to him.</p>
            <p>But while, on the other Hand, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
the Propoſal that was made to him,
by which his Life might have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
Who was cruel to my Lord <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wentwater</hi>
but my Lord <hi>Derwentwater?</hi>
And who cauſed him to be executed, the
King or himſelf?</p>
            <p>It is not worth while to examine here
what he calls inconſiſtent with Honour
and Conſcience: If it was not inconſiſtent
with his Honour and Conſcience to riſe in
Arms, that is as far as lay in him to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
Murther, and Deſtroy the King, and
all his Royal Family; It cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with the greateſt Clemency in
his Majeſty to bring ſuch to the Block.
But on the other Hand, it was the higheſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0147400900:28"/>
Teſtimony imaginable of Royal Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
to offer ſuch Men their Lives upon
their Teſtifying their Sorrow for the
Crime, by giving a true and faithful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of all the Parts of the Deſign, as far
as they were really concern'd in it: While
they deny this, what Token of Contrition,
what Satisfaction of future Loyalty can
they give? They pleaded Guilty, <hi>ſay their
Party,</hi> and threw themſelves upon Mercy,
and ſuch are generally thought more proper
Objects of Mercy than others: But let us
examine what is meant here by Pleading
Guilty, for except only the Form, I deny
that they <hi>pleaded Guilty</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Derwentwater</hi> very ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
explains what he underſtands by his
Pleading Guilty, it is in his Speech at the
Bar, the 13th of <hi>February</hi>: <hi>The ſaid Earl
acknowledges with a real Sorrow, that at
the Time in the Articles mentioned, he was
in Arms, and with others did march thro',
and invade ſeveral Parts of this Kingdom.</hi>
The Law indeed accepts this as Pleading
Guilty, becauſe the Fact being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
the Law determines from it both
the Guilt and the Penalty. But what's
this towards a Penitent, or towards ſuch
a Confeſſion as muſt merit Pardon.</p>
            <p>When a Priſoner pleads Guilty to the
Judge, he needs to own nothing but the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0147400900:29"/>
Fact, the Court, as I ſaid, determines all
the reſt.</p>
            <p>But when a Priſoner pleads Guilty to
his offended Prince, to move and implore
his Clemency and Mercy, it is not the
Fact but the Crime that he muſt charge
himſelf with; it behoves him to come and
acknowledge it thus: SIR, <hi>I own my ſelf
a Rebel to you juſt Authority; I am now
willing to become your faithful Subject, to
Recognize your Authority, and confeſs all my
Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in all theſe Gentlemen's Pleading
Guilty, there is not one Word of Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the CRIME, tho' there is of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
the Fact, that they were in Arms,
but do not own that they were Rebels:
Nay, my Lord <hi>Kenmure</hi> is ſo honeſt, <hi>if the
Paper ſaid to be left behind him be Genuine,</hi>
as to acknowledge he prevaricated in his
Pleading <hi>Guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let any Divine tell us, nay even
let a Popiſh Prieſt tell us, if this be ſound
in Divinity. Does God Himſelf Pardon
any Sinners that does not Confeſs their
Offences, or that Confeſs one part, but will
not Confeſs all? What claim to Mercy
can any Chriſtian make, upon any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
foundation but upon a FULL and
Sincere Confeſſion, I ſay FULL and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere;
<hi>He that hides his Sin ſhall not Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0147400900:30"/>
               <hi>But he that Confeſſes, and Forſakes,
ſhall find Mercy.</hi> Prov. 28. 13.</p>
            <p>Now theſe Gentlemen have indeed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
the Fact, and <hi>what is there in that?</hi>
Were they not Evident, and eaſy to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?
Was it in their power to Deny any
Part? Were they not all taken in the Field
of Battle, with the Sword of Rebellion in
their Hands? What thanks to them for that
Plea? But if they had come ingenuouſly
and confeſs'd <hi>the Treaſon,</hi> acknowledg'd <hi>the
Crime</hi> of it, laid open the Train of it, given
in a FULL Account of the Riſe and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of it; and then have expreſs'd their
Sorrow that they ſhould be Guilty of ſuch
a horrid Crime; had this been done, and
Mercy had been refuſed them, indeed they
would have had ſome room to talk of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,
<hi>tho' none then of Injuſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this way of Confeſſing does not, in
my Opinion, reach the Caſe at all, they
have made no Confeſſion of the Rebellion,
tho' they have of their being in Arms; in
a word, they have acknowledg'd themſelves
Rebells in or Senſe, but they have not ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledg'd
that <hi>they are ſenſible</hi> of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rebells; or that it is Rebellion in their
Own Senſe; and pray what does all this
amount to? For my ſhare I do not ſee they
have pleaded Guilty with any View but
that of the Scaffold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0147400900:31"/>
The Confeſſion of a Penitent is quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
thing, his confeſſion will be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
will be Sincere, and he will be more
afflicted for the Crime, than the Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Again, he that confeſſes his Guilt, muſt
confeſs <hi>all</hi> his Guilt, and <hi>all</hi> his Treaſon;
and he cannot be ſaid to make an ingenuous
Confeſſion that conceals any thing he
knows, which may be for the Detecting
the Treaſon, if any Part lies conceal'd, or
that may be for the Safety and Advantage
of the Prince, againſt whom he has offended.</p>
            <p>And here comes in the Objection, This is
againſt my Honour and Conſcience, becauſe
it will Impeach my Friends, break the
wicked Compact, the Engagement, or Oath
of Secreſy taken with other Traytors, <hi>and
what then?</hi> The Conſequence is, <hi>he takes
his Word again,</hi> as the <hi>Scots</hi> call it, relapſes
to a Rebel in Inclination, and begs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
that he has acknowledge'd that little
that he has.</p>
            <p>In a word, if theſe Gentlemen were not
ſpar'd, it was becauſe they would have
their Lives upon their own Terms, or not
at all; they would have Mercy ſhewn to
them for Sins unconfeſs'd; is there any
one of them that has given a full Narrative
of all the Treaſons they have Committed?
They have acknowledg'd the capital Part
indeed, which, as we may ſay, they could
not avoid, or get clear of; but what elſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0147400900:32"/>
have they Confeſs'd? Have they told the
Government any one thing which they
did not know before? Had my Lord <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wentwater</hi>
made ſuch an ingenuous Ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledgment
of all he knew of the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
I am bold to ſay, he would have
Merited ſome Mercy, and for that Reaſon
I believe he would have found it.</p>
            <p>But this manner of Confeſſion, ſay they,
would have betray'd Friends, brought
Great Men and Great Families to Ruin;
and, perhaps, a great many of them too;
and it is below the Honour of a Nobleman
to turn Informer.</p>
            <p>It were to be wiſh'd ſuch Men would put
the Circumſtances they have brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to into the Ballance, and conſider that
with the Point of Honour they ſpeak of:
If they had ſtood out either in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
or if, after Conviction, had reſolv'd
to meet Death as from the Hand of an
Enemy, then indeed it could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that they ſhould make any ſuch
Thing as a Confeſſion. But when they
lie proſtrate at the Foot of Majeſty, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
by the Law, Acknowledging the
Fact, and Imploring Mercy, this is quite
another Thing; and that theſe Men ſhould
reject the Conditions upon which Mercy
was offered them, this is perfectly inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
with the nature of their Submiſſion, and
aggravates the Crime they were guilty of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0147400900:33"/>
before, and makes the Neceſſity of dealing
with them in a Courſe of ſtrict Juſtice;
and this may be another Reaſon againſt
Mercy.</p>
            <p>It is below the Majeſty of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to name the Folly and Madneſs of
their Friends as a Reaſon for their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and yet it deſerves ſome Notice too:
No ſooner were theſe Men, with the reſt
of the <hi>Preſton</hi> Priſoners, come up, and had
been a little while in Priſon, but their
Friends laugh'd loudly at the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
telling them in their Teeth, that
they durſt not put them to Death; as if
the Power that was able to break them in
the Field, ſhould not be able to puniſh
them when in Priſon. But ſo prepoſterous
have they been in this Part, that they have
puſht the Government almoſt upon the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of bringing them to the Block, to
ſatisfy the World that they dare do it.</p>
            <p>This is very hard upon their Friends,
and has made their being brought to the
Block very reaſonable in the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
if not abſolutely neceſſary; and
it is worth while for them to conſider it on
ſeveral Accounts: (1.) How juſt the King
had been to have executed many more, and
have given that Inſolence of their Friends
as the Reaſon of it. And (2.) Whether
tho' for Time paſt it has not been done;
yet that if the King ſhould think fit to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0147400900:34"/>
execute ſome meerly upon the Importunity
of this Circumſtance, who otherwiſe his
Majeſty's Goodneſs might incline him to
pardon; I ſay, whether their Blood, tho'
not innocent, would not be ſo to thoſe
People, and be laid at their Door.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, there is a more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Reaſon ſtill to give why his Majeſty
may not have thought fit to extend that
Mercy to theſe Men, which otherwiſe,
perhaps, they might have found; <hi>viz.</hi>
The continued Threatenings of the Party
ſtill to renew their Attempts, to return
with a greater Force, and to revive the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
promiſing to reſcue their Sufferers
out of the Hand of publick Juſtice, and
to return the Treatment they have met
with.</p>
            <p>Let any one judge whether a threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Enemy is an Object of Mercy; and
whether it would conſiſt with the Honour
of his Majeſty's Government, and the
Safety of his Kingdom, to pardon Enemies
that are Inſulting him when out of his
Hands, and Conditioning with him even
when they are in.</p>
            <p>It muſt be allow'd, that Clemency is the
Glory of a King, and Mercy the Honour
of his Government: But Clemency is to
be directed by Wiſdom, as the Sword is to
be managed by Council. Rebellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<hi>unhumbled,</hi> can never be the proper
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0147400900:35"/>
Subject of the Prince's Clemency: Neither
is Juſtice executed upon obſtinate Rebels
any Breach of Moderation in Government.</p>
            <p>And how is a Rebel humbled, that
owns not his Rebellion to be a Crime?
How is he an Object of Mercy, that will
not accept of his Life but upon his own
Conditions? It's time to Capitulate when
they are not in the Hands of Juſtice. My
Lord <hi>Nithiſdale,</hi> who has made his Eſcape,
is in a much proper Poſture to aſk Mercy
after the manner they did, than they were.
He that implores Mercy, muſt firſt put
himſelf into the Condition that denominates
him a proper Object of Mercy, or he has
but little Reaſon to expect it.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty, no doubt, has yet more
and more forcible Reaſons for not Granting
the Mercy that was petitioned for to the
late Lord <hi>Derwentwater, &amp;c.</hi> but if not, I
cannot think but theſe will make it evident
to all the World, that it was not reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for them to expect Mercy in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
they were in, or ſafe for his
Majeſty to grant it. I hope thoſe who are
left, will take Care to behave more ſuitable
to their own Intereſt, and to deſerve better
the Mercy they expect.</p>
