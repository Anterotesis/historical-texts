            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is an acknowledg'd Truth, that nothing is ſo dear to an honeſt Man as his good Name, nor ought he to neglect the juſt Vindication of his Character, when it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly attack'd by any Man. The Perſon I have at preſent Cauſe to complain of, is indeed in very melancholy Circumſtances, it having pleas'd God to deprive him of his Senſes, which may extenuate the Crime in Him. But I ſhould be wanting in my Duty, not only to my ſelf, but alſo to my Fellow-Creatures, to whom my
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1243900600:6"/>
Talents may prove of benefit, ſhou'd I ſuffer my Profeſſion or Honeſty to be undeſervedly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd. I have therefore reſolv'd to give the Publick an account of all that has paſt between that unhappy Gentleman and my ſelf.</p>
            <p>On the 20<hi>th</hi> inſtant, while I was in my Cloſet pondering the Caſe of one of my Patients, I heard a Knocking at my Door, upon opening of which enter'd an old Woman with Tears in her Eyes, and told me, that without my Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance her Maſter would be utterly ruin'd. I was forc'd to interrupt her Sorrow by enquiring her Maſter's Name and Place of Abode. She told me he was one Mr. <hi>D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>is</hi> an Officer of the Cuſtom-houſe, who was taken ill of a violent Frenzy laſt <hi>April,</hi> and had continu'd in thoſe melancholy Circumſtances, with few or no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals. Upon this I ask'd her ſome Queſtions relating to his Humour and Extravagancies, that I might the better know under what Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to put him, when the Cauſe of his Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was found out. Alas, Sir, ſays ſhe, this Day fortnight in the Morning a poor ſimple Child came to him from the Printer's; the Boy had no ſooner enter'd the Room, but he cry'd out, <hi>the Devil was come.</hi> He often ſtares ghaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, raves aloud, and mutters between his Teeth the Word <hi>Cator,</hi> or <hi>Cato,</hi> or ſome ſuch thing. Now, Doctor, this <hi>Cator</hi> is certainly a <hi>Witch,</hi> and my poor Maſter is under an evil Tongue: for I have heard him ſay <hi>Cator</hi> has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd the whole Nation. It pitied my very Heart, to think that a Man of my Maſter's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and great Scholarſhip, (who, as the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1243900600:7"/>
Child told me, had a Book of his own in Print,) ſhould talk ſo outragiouſly. Upon this I went and laid out a Groat for a Horſhoe, which is at this time nail'd on the Threſhold of his Door; but I don't find my Maſter is at all the better for it; he prepetually ſtarts and runs to the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow when any one knocks, crying out, <hi>S' death! a Meſſenger from the French King! I ſhall die in the</hi> Baſtile.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid this, the Old Woman preſented me with a Viol of his Urine; upon Examination of which I preceiv'd the whole Temperament of his Body to be exceeding <hi>hot.</hi> I therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly took my Cane and my Beaver, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd to the Place where he dwelt.</p>
            <p>When I came to his Lodgings near <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> up <hi>three Pair</hi> of Stairs, (which I ſhould not have publiſh'd in this manner, but that this Lunatick <hi>conceals</hi> the Place of his Reſidence on purpoſe to prevent the good Offices of thoſe charitable <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> who might attempt his Cure) when I came into the Room, I found this unfortunate Gentleman ſeated on his Bed, with Mr. <hi>Bernard Lintott,</hi> Bookſeller, on the one ſide of him, and a grave elderly Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman on the other, who, as I have ſince learnt, calls himſelf a <hi>Grammarian;</hi> the Latitude of whoſe Countenance was not a little eclips'd by the Fullneſs of his Peruke. As I am a black lean Man, of a pale Viſage, and hang my Clothes on ſomewhat ſlovenly, I no ſooner went in but he frown'd upon me, and cry'd out with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, <q rend="inline">'<hi>S'Death,</hi> a <hi>Frenchman!</hi> I am betray'd to the Tyrant! who cou'd have thought the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1243900600:8"/>
Queen would have deliver'd me up to <hi>France</hi> in this Treaty, and leaſt of all that you, my Friends, wou'd have been in a Conſpiracy againſt me?'</q>—Sir, ſaid I, here is neither Plot nor Conſpiracy, but for your advantage. The Recovery of your Senſes requires my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, and your Friends ſent for me on no other account. I then took a particular Survey of his Perſon, and the Furniture and Diſpoſition of his Apartment. His Aſpect was furious, his Eyes were rather fiery than lively, which he roll'd about in an uncommon manner. He often o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd his Mouth, as if he wou'd have utter'd ſome Matter of Importance, but the Sound ſeem'd loſt inwardly. His Beard was grown, which they told me he would not ſuffer to be ſhav'd, believing the modern Dramatick Poets had corrupted all the Barbers in the Town to take the firſt Opportunity of cutting his Throat. His Eye-brows were grey, long, and grown to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which he knit with Indignation when any thing was ſpoken, inſomuch that he ſeem'd not to have ſmooth'd his Forehead for many Years. His Flannel Night Cap, which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly begrim'd with Sweat and Dirt, hung upon his Left Ear; the Flap of his Breeches dangled between his Legs, and the Rolls of his Stockings fell down to his Ankles.</p>
            <p>I obſerv'd his Room was hung with <hi>old Tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</hi> which had ſeveral Holes in it, caus'd, as the Old Woman inform'd me, by his having cut out of it the Heads of divers <hi>Tyrants,</hi> the Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of whoſe Viſages had much provoked him. On all ſides of his Room were pinned a great
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1243900600:9"/>
many Sheets of a Tragedy called <hi>Cato,</hi> with Notes on the Margin with his own Hand. The Words <hi>Abſurd, Monſtrous, Execrable,</hi> were every where written in ſuch large Characters, that I could read them without my Spectacles. By the Fre-ſide lay Three-farthings-worth of Small-coal in a <hi>Spectator,</hi> and behind the Door huge Heaps of Papers of the ſame Title, which his Nurſe inform'd me ſhe had convey'd thither out of his ſight, believing they were Books of the Black Art; for her Maſter never read in them, but he was either quite <hi>mop'd,</hi> or in <hi>raving Fits;</hi> There was nothing neat in the whole Room, except ſome Books on his Shelves very well bound and gilded, whoſe Names I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before heard of, nor I believe are any where elſe to be found; ſuch as <hi>Gibraltar, a Comedy; Remarks on Prince Arthur; the Grounds of Criticiſm in Poetry; an Eſſay on publick Spirit.</hi> The only one I had any Knowledge of was a <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> interleav'd. The whole Floor was cover'd with Manuſcripts, as thick as a Paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cook's Shop on a Chriſtmas Eve. On his Table were ſome Ends of Verſe and of Candles; a Gallipot of Ink with a yellow Pen in it, and a Pot of half-dead Ale cover'd with a <hi>Longinus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I was caſting my Eyes round on all this odd Furniture with ſome Earneſtneſs and Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and in a profound Silence, I was on a ſudden ſurpriz'd to hear the Man ſpeak in the following manner:</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Beware, Doctor, that it fare not with you as with your Predeceſſor the famous <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> whom the miſtaken Citizens of <hi>Abdera</hi> ſent
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1243900600:10"/>
for in this very manner to cure the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Democritus;</hi> he return'd full of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at the Wiſdom of that Perſon whom he had ſuppos'd a Lunatic. Behold, Doctor, it was thus <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf and all the great Antients ſpent their Days and Nights, wrapt up in Criticiſm, and beſet all around with their own Writings. As for me, whom you ſee in the ſame manner, be aſſur'd I have none other Diſeaſe than a Swelling in my Legs, whereof I ſay no more, ſince your Art may further cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify you."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I began now to be in hopes that his Caſe had been miſrepreſented, and that he was not ſo far gone, but ſome timely Medicines might recover him. I therefore proceeded to the proper Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which with the Anſwers made to me, I ſhall ſet down in Form of Dialogue, in the very Words they were ſpoken, becauſe I would not omit the leaſt Circumſtance in this Narrative; and I call my Conſcience to witneſs, as if upon Oath, that I ſhall tell the Truth without addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or diminution.</p>

            <p>I took Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> home with me, in order to have our Wounds dreſt, and laid hold of that Opportunity of entering into Diſcourſe with him about the Madneſs of this Perſon, of whom he gave me the following remarkable Relation:</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1243900600:17"/>
of Poetical Juſtice, and caſt it into the Street. That the ſaid Mr. <hi>John D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>is</hi> on the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1712, finding on the ſaid Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi>'s Counter a Book called an <hi>Eſſay on Criticiſm,</hi> juſt then publiſh'd, he read a Page or two with much Frowning, till coming to theſe two Lines;
<q>
                  <l>Some have at firſt for Wits, then Poets paſt,</l>
                  <l>Turn'd Ctiticks next, and prov'd plain Fools at laſt.</l>
               </q>
He flung down the Book in a terrible Fury, and cried out, <hi>By G<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>d he means Me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That being in his Company on a certain Time, when <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> was mention'd as of a contrary Opinion to Mr. <hi>Dennis,</hi> he ſwore the ſaid <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear</hi> was a <hi>Raſcal,</hi> with other defamatory Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which gave Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> a very ill Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ſaid <hi>Shakeſpear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That about two Months ſince, he came again into the Shop, and caſt ſeveral ſuſpicious Looks on a Gentleman that ſtood by him, after which he deſired ſome Information concerning that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He was no ſooner acquainted that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was a new Author, and that his firſt Piece was to be publiſh'd in a few Days, but he drew his Sword upon him, and had not my Servant luckily catch'd him by the Sleeve, I might have loſt one Author upon the ſpot, and another the next Seſſions.</p>
            <p>Upon recollecting all theſe Circumſtances, Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> was entirely of Opinion, that he had been mad for ſome Time; and I doubt not but this whole Narrative muſt ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince

the World of the exceſs of his Frenzy. It now remains, that I give the Reaſons which obliged me in my own Vindication to publiſh this whole unfortunate Tranſaction.</p>

            <p>Secondly, He hath given out about <hi>Fleetſtreet</hi> and the <hi>Temple,</hi> that I was an Accomplice with his Bookſeller, who viſited him with Intent to take away divers valuable Manuſcripts, without paying him Copy-Money.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He hath told others, that I am no Graduate Phyſician, and that he had ſeen me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Mountebank Stage in <hi>Moorfields,</hi> when he had Lodgings in the College there.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Knowing that I had much Practice in the City, he reported at the <hi>Royal Exchange, Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> and other Places adjacent, that I was a foreign Spy, employ'd by the <hi>French</hi> King to convey him into <hi>France;</hi> that I bound him Hand and Foot; and that, if his Friend had not burſt from his Confinement to his Relief, he had been at this Hour in the <hi>Baſtile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which ſeveral Aſſertions of his are ſo very extravagant, as well as inconſiſtent, that I appeal to all Mankind whether this Perſon be not out of his Senſes. I ſhall not decline giving and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing further Proofs of this Truth in open Court, if he drives the Matter ſo far. In the mean

            <head>A full and true ACCOUNT OF A Horrid and Barbarous REVENGE by POISON, On the Body of Mr. <hi>EDMUND CURLL,</hi> Bookſeller; With a faithful COPY of his Laſt WILL and TESTAMENT</head>
            <p>HISTORY furniſhes us with Examples of many Satyrical <hi>Authors</hi> who have fallen Sacrifices to Revenge, but not of any <hi>Bookſellers</hi> that I know of, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the unfortunate Subject of the following Paper; I mean Mr. <hi>Edmund Curll,</hi> at the <hi>Bible</hi> and <hi>Dial</hi> in <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> who was yeſterday poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd by Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> after having liv'd many Years
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1243900600:21"/>
an Inſtance of the mild Temper of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>Every Body knows that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Edmund Curll,</hi> on <hi>Monday</hi> the 26th Inſtant, publiſh'd a Satyrical Piece, entituled <hi>Court Poems,</hi> in the Preface whereof they were attributed to a Lady of Quality, Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Gay;</hi> by which indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Method though he had eſcap'd one Revenge, there were ſtill two behind in reſerve.</p>
            <p>Now on the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> enſuing, between the Hours of Ten and Eleven, Mr. <hi>Lintott,</hi> a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b'ring Bookſeller, deſired a Conference with Mr. <hi>Curll</hi> about ſettling a <hi>Title-Page,</hi> inviting him at the ſame Time to take a Whet together. Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> (who is not the only Inſtance how Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of bright Parts may be carry'd away by the Inſtigation of the Devil) found Means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey himſelf into the ſame Room, under Pretence of Buſineſs with Mr. <hi>Lintott,</hi> who it ſeems is the Printer of his <hi>Homer.</hi> This Gentleman with a ſeeming Coolneſs, reprimanded Mr. <hi>Curll</hi> for wrongfully aſcribing to him the aforeſaid Poems: He excuſed himſelf by declaring that one of his Authors (Mr. <hi>Oldmixon</hi> by Name) gave the Copies to the Preſs, and wrote the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</hi> Upon this Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> (being to all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance reconcil'd) very civily drank a Glaſs of Sack to Mr. <hi>Curll,</hi> which he as civilly pledged; and tho' the Liquor in Colour and Taſte diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not from common Sack, yet was it plain by the Pangs this unhappy Stationer felt ſoon after, that ſome poiſonous Drug had been ſecretly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed therein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1243900600:22"/>
About eleven a Clock he went home, where his Wife obſerving his Colour chang'd, ſaid, <hi>Are you not Sick, my Dear?</hi> He reply'd, <hi>Bloody Sick;</hi> and incontinently fell a vomiting and ſtraining in an uncommon and unnatural Manner, the Contents of his vomiting being as green as Graſs. His Wife had been juſt read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Book of her Husband's printing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jane Wenham,</hi> the famous Witch of <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and her Mind miſgave her that he was <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd;</hi> but he ſoon let her know that he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Poiſon, and recounted to her, between the Intervals of his Yawnings and Reachings, every Circumſtance of his Interview with Mr. <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> in the mean time coming in, was extreamly affrighted at the ſudden Alteration he obſerv'd in Him: <hi>Brother</hi> Curll, ſays he, <hi>I fear you have got the Vomiting Diſtemper; which (I have heard) kills in half an Hour. This comes from your not following my Advice, to drink old Hock in a Morning, as I do, and abſtain from Sack,</hi> Mr. <hi>Curll</hi> reply'd in a moving Tone, <hi>Your Author's Sack I fear has done my Buſineſs, Z<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ds,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Lintott, my Author!—Why did not you drink old Hock?</hi> Notwithſtanding which rough Remonſtrance, he did in the moſt friendly Manner preſs him to take warm Water; but Mr. <hi>Curll</hi> did with great Obſtinacy refuſe it; which made Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> Infer, that he choſe to die, as thinking to recover greater Damages.</p>
            <p>All this Time the Symptoms encreas'd vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, with accute Pains in the lower Belly. <hi>Brother</hi> Lintott, ſays he, <hi>I perceive my laſt Hour</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1243900600:23"/>
               <hi>approaching; do me the friendly Office to call my Partner, Mr.</hi> Pemberton, <hi>that we may ſettle our Worldly Affairs.</hi> Mr. <hi>Lintott,</hi> like a kind Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was haſtening out of the Room, while Mr. <hi>Curll</hi> rav'd aloud in this manner: <hi>If I ſurvive this, I will be reveng'd on</hi> Tonſon; <hi>it was he firſt detected me as the Printer of theſe Poems, and I will reprint theſe very Poems in his Name.</hi> His Wife admoniſh'd him not to think of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, but to take care of his Stock and his Soul: And in the ſame Inſtant, Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> (whoſe Goodneſs can never be enough applauded) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with Mr. <hi>Pemberton.</hi> After ſome Tears jointly ſhed by theſe humane Bookſellers, Mr. <hi>Curll</hi> being (as he ſaid) in his perfect Senſes though in great bodily Pain, immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to make a verbal Will (Mrs. <hi>Curll</hi> having firſt put on his Night-Cap) in the following Ma nner.</p>
            <p>GEntlemen, in the firſt Place, I do ſincerely pray Forgiveneſs for thoſe indirect Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods I have purſued in inventing new Titles to old Books, putting Authors Names to things they never ſaw, publiſhing private Quarrels for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Entertainment; all which, I hope will be pardoned, as being done to get an honeſt liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>I do alſo heartily beg Pardon of all Perſons of Honour, Lords Spiritual and Temporal, Gentry, Burgeſſes, and Commonalty, to whoſe Abuſe I have any or every way contributed by my Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications, particularly, I hope it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1243900600:24"/>
that if I have vilify'd his Grace the Duke of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> I have likewiſe aſpers'd the late Duke of <hi>Ormond;</hi> if I have abuſed the honourable Mr. <hi>Walpole,</hi> I have alſo libell'd the Lord <hi>Bolingbroke?</hi> ſo that I have preſerv'd that <hi>Equality</hi> and <hi>Impartiality</hi> which becomes an <hi>honeſt Man</hi> in Times of Faction and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion.</p>
            <p>I call my Conſcience to witneſs, that many of theſe Things which may ſeem malicious were done out of <hi>Charity;</hi> I having made it wholly my buſineſs to print for poor diſconſolate Authors, whom all other Bookſellers refuſe. Only God bleſs Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore!</hi> you know he takes no <hi>Copy-money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Collection of Poems, which I groundleſly call'd Mr. <hi>Prior</hi>'s, will ſell for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and hath not yet paid the Charge of the Advertiſements, which I was obliged to publiſh <hi>againſt him:</hi> Therefore you may as well ſuppreſs the Edition, and beg that Gentleman's pardon in the name of a dying Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French Cato,</hi> with the Criticiſm ſhowing how ſuperior it is to Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi>'s, (which I wickedly aſcribed to Madam <hi>Dacier</hi>) may be ſuppreſs'd at a reaſonable Rate, being damnably tranſlated.</p>
            <p>I proteſt I have no Animoſity to Mr. <hi>Rowe,</hi> having printed part of <hi>Callipaedia,</hi> and an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Edition of his Poems without his Leave, in Quarto. Mr. <hi>Gildon</hi>'s <hi>Rehearſal</hi> or <hi>Bays the Younger,</hi> did more harm to me than to Mr. <hi>Rowe;</hi> though upon the Faith of an honeſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1243900600:25"/>
Man, I paid him double, for abuſing both him and Mr. <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heaven pardon me for publiſhing the <hi>Trials of Sodomy</hi> in an <hi>Elzevir</hi> Letter! but I humbly hope, my printing Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore</hi>'s <hi>Eſſays</hi> will attone for them. I beg that you will take what remains of theſe laſt, (which is near the whole Impreſſion, Preſents excepted) and let my poor Widow have in exchange the ſole Propriety of the Copy of Madam <hi>Maſcranny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Here Mr.</hi> Pemberton <hi>interrupted, and would by no means conſent to this Article, about which ſome Diſpute might have ariſen unbecoming a dying Perſon, if Mr.</hi> Lintott <hi>had not interpoſed and Mr.</hi> Curll <hi>vomited.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What this poor unfortunate Man ſpoke after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, was ſo indiſtinct, and in ſuch broken Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, (being perpetually interrupted by Vomitings) that the Reader is intreated to excuſe the Confuſion and Imperfection of this Account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dear Mr. <hi>Pemberton,</hi> I beg you to beware of the Indictment at <hi>Hicks</hi>'s <hi>Hall,</hi> for publiſhing <hi>Rocheſter</hi>'s bawdy Poems; that Copy will other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be my beſt Legacy to my dear Wife, and helpleſs Child.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Caſe of Impotence</hi> was my beſt Support, all the laſt long Vacation.</p>
            <p>[<hi>In this laſt Paragraph Mr.</hi> Curll<hi>'s Voice grew more free, for his Vomitings abated upon his Deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and he ſpoke what follows from his Cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:1243900600:26"/>
For the Copies of Noblemen's and Biſhop's <hi>Laſt Wills and Teſtaments,</hi> I ſolemnly declare I printed them not with any Purpoſe of Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but meerly as I thought thoſe Copies law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully purchaſed from <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> at <hi>One Shilling</hi> a piece. Our Trade in Wills turning to ſmall Account, we may divide them blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
            <p>For Mr. <hi>Manwaring</hi>'s <hi>Life,</hi> I ask Mrs. <hi>Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>'s Pardon: Neither <hi>His</hi> nor my Lord <hi>Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi>'s Lives, though they were of ſervice to their Country, were of any to me: But I was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſince I could not print their Works while they liv'd, to print their Lives after they were dead.</p>
            <p>While he was ſpeaking theſe Words Mr. <hi>Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixon</hi> enter'd. <hi>Ah! Mr.</hi> Oldmixon (ſaid poor Mr. <hi>Curll</hi>) <hi>to what a Condition have your Works reduced me! I die a Martyr to that unlucky Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. However, in theſe my laſt Moments I will be juſt to all Men; you ſhall have your third Share of the</hi> Court Poems, <hi>as was ſtipulated. When I am dead, where will you find</hi> another Bookſeller? <hi>Your</hi> Proteſtant Packet <hi>might have ſupported you, had you writ a little leſs ſcurrilouſly; there is a Mean in all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> interrupted. Why not find <hi>another Bookſeller, Brother Curll?</hi> and then took Mr. <hi>Oldmixon</hi> aſide and whiſper'd him: <hi>Sir, As ſoon as</hi> Curll <hi>is dead, I ſhall be glad to talk with you over a Pint at the</hi> Devil.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Curll</hi> now turning to Mr <hi>Pemberton,</hi> told him, he had ſeveral <hi>Taking Title-Pages</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1243900600:27"/>
that only wanted Treatiſes to be wrote to them; and earneſtly deſired that when they were writ, his Heirs might have ſome Share of the Profit of them.</p>
            <p>After he had ſaid this, he fell into horrible Gripings, upon which Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> advis'd him to repeat the Lord's Prayer. He deſir'd his Wife to ſtep into the Shop for a <hi>Common Prayer Book,</hi> and read it by the Help of a Candle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Heſitation. He clos'd the Book, fetch'd a Groan, and recommended to Mrs. <hi>Curll</hi> to give Forty Shillings to the Poor of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Dunſtan</hi>'s, and a <hi>Week</hi>'s <hi>Wages</hi> advance to each of his Gentlemen-Authors, with ſome ſmall Gratuity in particular to Mrs. <hi>Centlivre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The poor Man continued for ſome Hours with all his diſconſolate Family about him in Tears, expecting his final Diſſolution; when of a ſudden he was ſurprizingly relieved by a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful foetid Stool, which obliged them all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire out of the Room. Notwithſtanding, it is judged by Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore,</hi> that the Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is ſtill latent in his Body, and will infallibly deſtroy him by ſlow Degrees, in leſs than a Month. It is to be hoped, the other Enemies of this wretched Stationer will not further pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their Revenge, or ſhorten this ſmall Period of his miſerable Life.</p>

               <hi>Wit</hi> (ſaith Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore</hi>) <hi>proceeds from a Concurrence of regular and exalted Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and an Affluence of Animal Spirits recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd and refin'd to a Degree of Purity.</hi> On the contrary, when the igneous Particles riſe with the vital Liquor, they produce an abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

            <p>The Symptoms of his Departure from his uſual Temper of Mind, were at firſt only <hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing civilly to his Cuſtomers, ſingeing a Pig with a new purchaſed Libel,</hi> and <hi>refuſing Two-and-Nine-Pence for Sir</hi> Richard Blackmore<hi>'s Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays.</hi>

            <p>As the poor Man's Frenzy encreas'd, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to <hi>void his Excrements in his Bed, read</hi> Rocheſter<hi>'s bawdy Poems to his Wife,</hi> gave <hi>Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixon</hi> a <hi>ſlap</hi> on the <hi>Chops,</hi> and wou'd have kiſs'd Mr. <hi>Pemberton</hi>'s A<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Theſe Reſolutions being taken, the Aſſembly was ready to break up, but they took ſo near apart in Mr. <hi>Curll</hi>'s Afflictions, that none of them could leave him without giving him ſome Advice to reinſtate him in his Health.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gildon</hi> was of opinion, That in order to drive a <hi>Pope</hi> out of his <hi>Belly,</hi> he ſhould get the Mummy of ſome deceas'd <hi>Moderator</hi> of the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be taken inwardly as an effectual Antidote againſt <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Oldmixon</hi> did conceive that the <hi>Liver</hi> of the Perſon who adminiſtred the Poiſon, boil'd in Broth, would be a more certain Cure.</p>
            <p>While the Company were expecting the Thanks of Mr. <hi>Curll,</hi> for theſe demonſtrations of their Zeal, a whole pile of Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s <hi>Eſſays</hi> on a ſudden fell on his Head; the Shock of which in an Inſtant brought back his Deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.

            <p>Now <hi>G-d damn all Folio's, Quarto's, Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo's</hi> and <hi>Duodecimo's!</hi> ungrateful Varlets that you are, who have ſo long taken up my Houſe without paying for your Lodging?—Are you not the beggarly Brood of fumbling <hi>Journeymen;</hi> born in <hi>Garrets,</hi> among <hi>Lice</hi> and <hi>Cobwebs,</hi> nurs'd up on <hi>Grey Peas, Bullocks Liver,</hi> and <hi>Porters Ale?</hi>—Was not the firſt Light you ſaw, the <hi>Farthing</hi> candle I paid for?

            <p>AVARICE (as Sir <hi>Richard</hi> in the Third Page of his Eſſays hath elegantly obſerv'd) <hi>is an inordinate Impulſe of the Soul towards the amaſſing or heaping together a Superfluity of Wealth without the leaſt Regard of applying it to its proper Uſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how the Mind of Man is poſſeſſed with this Vice, may be ſeen every Day both in the City and Suburbs thereof. It has been always eſteemed by <hi>Plato, Puffendorf</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:1243900600:41"/>
as the darling Vice of old Age: But now our young Men are turn'd Uſurers and Stock-job<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and, inſtead of luſting after the real Wives and Daughters of our rich Citizens, they covet nothing but their Money and Eſtates. Strange Change of Vice! when the Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence of Youth is converted into the Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Age, and thoſe Appetites are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come VENAL which ſhould be VENEREAL.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Place, let us ſhew you how many of the ancient Worthies and Heroes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity have been undone and ruin'd by this Deadly Sin of Avarice.</p>
            <p>I ſhall take the Liberty to begin with <hi>Brutus,</hi> that noble <hi>Roman.</hi> Does not <hi>Aetian</hi> inform us that he received Fifty Broad Pieces for the Aſſaſſination of that renowned Emperor <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> who fell a Sacrifice to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as Sir <hi>Edmund Bury Godfrey</hi> did to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts?</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Even the great <hi>Cato</hi> (as the late Mr. <hi>Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> hath very well obſerv'd) though otherwiſe a Gentleman of good Senſe, was not unſully'd by this pecuniary Contagion: For he ſold <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> for a hundred <hi>Rix-Dollars,</hi> which in our Money will amount to two <hi>Talents</hi> and thirty <hi>Seſtertii,</hi> according to Mr. <hi>Demoiver</hi>'s Calculation. <hi>See</hi> Heſiod <hi>in his</hi> 7<hi>th Chapter of</hi> Feaſts <hi>and</hi> Feſtivals.</p>

Actuated by the ſame Diabolical Spirit of Gain, <hi>Scylla</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul ſhot <hi>Alcibiades</hi> the Senator with a Piſtol, and robb'd him of ſeveral <hi>Bank Bills</hi> and <hi>Chequer Notes</hi> to an immenſe Value; for which he came to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely End, and was deny'd <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Burial. Hence comes the Proverb <hi>incidat in Scyllam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To come near to our own Times, and give you one modern Inſtance (tho' well known and often quoted by Hiſtorians, <hi>viz. Echard, Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus, Virgil, Horace,</hi> and others) 'Tis that, I mean, of the famous <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> of <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> one of the great Heroes of the Holy War, who robb'd <hi>Cleopatra</hi> Queen of <hi>Egypt</hi> of a Diamond Necklace, Ear-Rings, and a <hi>Tompion</hi>'s Gold Watch (which was given her by <hi>Mark Antony</hi>) all theſe things were found in <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Breeches Pocket, when he was kill'd at the Seige of <hi>Damaſcus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who then can wonder after ſo many great and illuſtrious Examples that Mr. <hi>Edmund Curll</hi> the Stationer, ſhould renounce the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> for the <hi>Mammon</hi> of Unrighteouſneſs, and barter his precious Faith for the filthy Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Lucre in the preſent Fluctuation of <hi>Stocks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It having been obſerved to Mr. <hi>Curll</hi> by ſome of his ingenious Authors, (who I fear are not over-charg'd with any Religion) what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Sums the <hi>Jews</hi> had got by <hi>Bubbles,</hi> &amp;c. he immediately turned his Mind from the Buſineſs in which he was educated, but thriv'd little, and reſolv'd to quit his Shop, for <hi>Change Alley.</hi> Whereupon falling into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

with the <hi>Jews</hi> at their Club at the Sign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> in <hi>Cornhill,</hi> they began to tamper with him upon the moſt important Points of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> which he for ſome time zealouſly, and <hi>like a good Chriſtian obſtinately</hi> defended. They promiſed him <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and many other Advantages <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,</hi> but he artfully inſinuated that he was more inclinable to liſten to <hi>preſent</hi> Gain. They took the Hint, and promis'd him that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon his Converſion to their Perſuaſion he ſhould become as rich as a <hi>Jew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They made uſe likewiſe of ſeveral other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to wit,</p>
            <p>That the wiſeſt Man that ever was, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch the richeſt, beyond all peradventure, was a <hi>Jew,</hi> videlicet <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>David</hi> the Man after God's own Heart, was a <hi>Jew</hi> alſo. And moſt of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are ſuſpected for holding the ſame Doctrine.</p>
            <p>This Mr. <hi>Curll</hi> at firſt ſtrenuouſly deny'd, for indeed he thought them <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and ſo far was he from giving way to their Temptations, that to convince them of his <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> he call'd for a <hi>Pork Grisking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They now promis'd if he would poiſon his Wife and give up his <hi>Grisking,</hi> that he ſhould marry the rich <hi>Ben Meymon</hi>'s only Daughter. This made ſome Impreſſion on him.</p>
            <p>They then talk'd to him in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, which he not underſtanding, it was obſerv'd had very great Weight with him.</p>

They, now perceiving that his <hi>Godlineſs</hi> was only <hi>Gain,</hi> deſiſted from all other Arguments, and attack'd him on his weak ſide, namely that of <hi>Avarice.</hi>

            <p>Sir <hi>Gideon Lopez</hi> tempted him with <hi>Forty Pound</hi> Subſcription in <hi>Ram</hi>'s <hi>Bubble;</hi> for which he was content to give up the <hi>Four Evangeliſts,</hi> and he was now compleated a perfect <hi>Jew,</hi> all but <hi>Black-Pudding</hi> and <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion;</hi> for both of which he would have been glad to have had a Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>But on the 17th of <hi>March,</hi> Mr. <hi>Curll</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to his Wife) came to the Tavern aſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. At his Entrance into the Room he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a meagre Man with a ſallow Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, a black forky Beard, and long Veſtment. In his Right Hand he held a large Pair of Sheers, and in his Left a red hot Searing-Iron. At Sight of this, Mr. <hi>Curll</hi>'s Heart trembled within him, and feign would he retire; but he was prevented by ſix Jews, who laid Hands upon him, and unbuttoning his Breeches
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1243900600:45"/>
threw him upon the Table, a pale pitiful Spectacle.</p>
            <p>He now intreated them in the moſt moving Tone of Voice to diſpenſe with that <hi>unmanly</hi> Ceremonial, which if they would conſent to, he faithfully promis'd that he would eat a Quarter of <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> with them the next <hi>Sunday</hi> following.</p>
            <p>All theſe Proteſtations availed him nothing, for they threatned him that all Contracts and Bargains ſhould be void unleſs he would ſubmit to bear all the <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>viſible</hi> Signs of <hi>Judaiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Apoſtate hearing this, ſtretched himſelf upon his Back, ſpread his Legs, and waited for the Operation; but when he ſaw the High-Prieſt take up the <hi>Cleft Stick,</hi> he roared moſt unmercifully, and ſwore ſeveral Chriſtian Oaths, for which the <hi>Jews</hi> rebuked him.</p>
            <p>The Savour of the <hi>Effluvia</hi> that iſſued from him, convinced the Old <hi>Levite</hi> and all his Aſſiſtants that he needed no preſent <hi>Purgation,</hi> wherefore without farther <hi>anointing</hi> him he proceeded in his Office; when by an unfortunate Jerk upward of the impatient Victim, he loſt five times as much as ever Jew did before,</p>
            <p>They finding that he was too much circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd, which by the <hi>Levitical Law</hi> is worſe than not being circumcis'd at all, refuſed to ſtand to any of their Contracts: Wherefore they caſt him forth from their Synagogue; and he now remains a moſt piteous, woful and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sight at the Sign of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> and <hi>Dial</hi> in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> his Wife, (poor Woman)

            <head type="sub">Shewing the miſerable Fates of Perſons addicted to this Crying Sin, in Court and Town.</head>
            <p>MAnifold have been the Judgments which Heav'n from Time to Time, for the Chaſtiſement of a Sinful People, has inflicted on whole Nations. For when the Degeneracy becomes Common, 'tis but Juſt the Puniſhment ſhould be General: Of this kind, in our own unfortunate Country, was that deſtructive Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, whoſe Mortality was ſo fatal, as to ſweep away, if Sir <hi>William Petty</hi> may be believ'd, Five Millions of Chriſtian Souls, beſides Women and Jews.</p>
            <p>Such alſo was that dreadful Conflagration en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing, in this famous metropolis of <hi>London,</hi> which conſumed, according to the Computation of Sir <hi>Samuel Morland,</hi> 100000 Houſes, not to mention Churches and Stables.</p>

Scarce had this Unhappy Nation recover'd theſe Funeſt Diſaſters, when the Abomination of Play-houſes roſe up in this Land: From hence hath an Inundation of Obſcenity flow'd from the Court and overſpread the Kingdom: Even Infants disfigured the Walls of holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with exorbitant Repreſentations of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Generation; nay, no ſooner had they learnt to Spell, but they had Wickedneſs enough to Write the Names thereof in large Capitals: an Enormity, obſerv'd by Travellers to be found in no Country but <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when Whoring and Popery were driven hence by the Happy <hi>Revolution;</hi> ſtill the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo greatly offended, that <hi>Socinianiſm, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm</hi> and <hi>Whiſtoniſm</hi> triumph'd in our Streets, and were in a manner become Univerſal.</p>
            <p>And yet ſtill, after all theſe Viſitations, it has pleaſed Heaven to viſit us with a Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more Epidemical, and of conſequence more Fatal: This was foretold to us, Firſt, by that unparallel'd Eclipſe in 1714: Secondly, By the dreadful Coruſcation in the Air this preſent Year: And Thirdly, By the Nine Comets ſeen at once over <hi>Soho-Square,</hi> by Mrs. <hi>Katherine Wadlington,</hi> and Others; a Contagion that firſt crept in amongſt the Firſt Quality, deſcended to their Footman, and infuſed it ſelf into their Ladies: I mean the woful Practice of PUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NING. This does occaſion the Corruption of our Language, and therein of the Word of God tranſlated into our Language, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly every ſober Chriſtian muſt Tremble at.</p>

            <head>THE WONDERFUL WONDER of WONDERS.</head>
            <p>THERE is a certain Perſon lately arrived at this City, whom it is very proper the World ſhould be informed of. His Character may, perhaps, be thought very Inconſiſtent, Improbable, and Unnatural; however I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to draw it with the utmoſt Regard to Truth. This I am the better qualified to do, becauſe he is a ſort of <hi>Dependant</hi> upon our Family, and <hi>almoſt</hi> of the ſame <hi>Age;</hi> tho' I cannot directly ſay, I have ever <hi>ſecn</hi> him. He is a Native of this Country, and hath lived long among us, but what appears wonderful, and hardly credible, was never ſeen <hi>before,</hi> by any Mortal.</p>
            <p>It is true, indeed, he always chuſes the <hi>loweſt</hi> Place in Company, and contrives it ſo, to keep <hi>out of Sight.</hi> It is reported, however, that in his younger Days he was frequently <hi>expoſed</hi> to <hi>View,</hi> but always againſt his Will, and was ſure to <hi>ſmart</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>As to his Family, he came into the World a Younger Brother, being of <hi>ſix</hi> Children, the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1243900600:52"/>
               <hi>fourth</hi> in order of (<ref target="#CT148130.P52N1">1</ref>) Birth; of which the eldeſt is now <hi>Head</hi> of the Houſe, the ſecond and third carry <hi>Arms:</hi> but the two Youngeſt are only <hi>Footmen:</hi> Some indeed, add, that he hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Twin-Brother, who lives <hi>over-againſt</hi> him, and keeps a (<ref target="#CT148130.P52N2">2</ref>) <hi>Victualling-Houſe:</hi> He has the Reputation to be a <hi>cloſe, griping, ſqueezing</hi> Fellow; and that when his Bags are <hi>full,</hi> he is often <hi>Needy;</hi> yet, when the Fit takes him, as faſt as he gets, he <hi>lets it fly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When in <hi>Office,</hi> no one <hi>diſchargeth</hi> himſelf, or <hi>does his Buſineſs</hi> better. He hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>ſtrained hard</hi> for an Honeſt Livelihood, and never got a <hi>Bit,</hi> till every Body elſe had <hi>done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Practice appears very blameable in him, that every Morning he privately frequents <hi>unclean Houſes,</hi> where any modeſt Perſon would bluſh to be ſeen. And altho' this be generally known, yet the World, as Cenſorious as it is, is ſo kind to overlook this Infirmity in him. To deal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, it muſt be granted, that he is too great a Lover of himſelf, and very often conſults his own <hi>Eaſe</hi> at the Expence of his beſt Friends. But this is one of his <hi>blind-Sides;</hi> and the beſt of Men I fear are not without <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He hath been conſtituted by the <hi>higher</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Station of <hi>Receiver-General,</hi> in which Employment ſome have cenſured him for play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>faſt</hi> and <hi>looſe.</hi> He is likewiſe <hi>Overſeer</hi> of the <hi>Golden Mines,</hi> which he daily inſpects when his Health will permit him.</p>
            <p>He was long bred under a (<ref target="#CT148130.P52N3">3</ref>) <hi>Maſter of Arts,</hi> who inſtilled good <hi>Principles</hi> in him, but theſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1243900600:53"/>
were ſoon <hi>Corrupted.</hi> I know not whether this deſerves mention, that he is ſo very Capricious, as to take it for an equal Affront to talk either of <hi>kiſſing</hi> or <hi>kicking</hi> him, which hath occaſion'd a Thouſand Quarrels: However no body was ever ſo great a Sufferer for Faults which he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, nor poſſibly could be guilty of.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>Religion</hi> he has thus much of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, that he ſtands <hi>always covered,</hi> even in the Preſence of the King; in moſt other Points, a perfect (<ref target="#CT148130.P53N4">4</ref>) <hi>Idolater,</hi> altho' he endeavours to <hi>conceal</hi> it; for he is known to offer daily Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to certain <hi>Subterraneous Nymphs,</hi> whom he worſhips in an <hi>humble Poſture, prone on his Face,</hi> and <hi>ſtript ſtark Naked,</hi> and ſo leaves his <hi>Offerings behind him,</hi> which the (<ref target="#CT148130.P53N5">5</ref>) <hi>Prieſts</hi> of thoſe Goddeſſes are careful enough to remove upon certain Seaſons, with the utmoſt Privacy at <hi>Midnight,</hi> and from thence maintain'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and Families. In all <hi>urgent Neceſſities</hi> and <hi>Preſſures</hi> he applies himſelf to theſe Deities, and ſometimes even in the <hi>Streets</hi> and <hi>High-ways,</hi> from an <hi>Opinion</hi> that thoſe Powers have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in all Places, altho' their peculiar Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is in Caverns under Ground. Upon theſe <hi>Occaſions</hi> the faireſt Ladies will not refuſe to <hi>lend</hi> their <hi>Hands</hi> to aſſiſt him: For, altho' they are aſham'd to have him <hi>ſeen</hi> in their Company, or even ſo much as to hear him <hi>Named;</hi> yet it is well known, that he is one of their <hi>conſtant Followers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Politicks,</hi> he always ſubmits to what is <hi>uppermoſt,</hi> but he peruſes Pamphlets <hi>on both</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:1243900600:54"/>
               <hi>Sides</hi> with great Impartiality, tho' ſeldom till <hi>every Body elſe have done with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>Learning</hi> is of a mixed kind, and he may properly be called a <hi>Helluo librorum,</hi> or another <hi>Jacobus de Voragine:</hi> tho' his Studies are chiefly confined to <hi>School-men, Commentators,</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Divines,</hi> together with <hi>Modern Poetry</hi> and <hi>Criticks:</hi> And he is an <hi>Atomick</hi> Philoſopher, ſtrongly maintaining a <hi>Void</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> which he ſeems to have fairly proved by many <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to deſcribe ſome peculiar Qualities, which in ſeveral Inſtances ſeem to diſtinguiſh this Perſon from the common Race of other Mortals.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Grandfather</hi> was a Member of the <hi>Rump</hi> Parliament, as the <hi>Grandſon</hi> is of the <hi>Preſent,</hi> where he often <hi>riſes,</hi> ſometimes <hi>grumbles</hi> but never <hi>ſpeaks.</hi> However, he lets nothing paſs <hi>willingly,</hi> but what is <hi>well digeſted.</hi> His Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is indiſputable, for he will take the boldeſt Man alive <hi>by the Noſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is generally the <hi>firſt a Bed</hi> in the Family, and the <hi>laſt up,</hi> which is to be lamented, becauſe when he happens to <hi>riſe before</hi> the reſt, it hath been thought to forebode ſome <hi>good Fortune to his Superiors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Wiſdom is acquired by Age, ſo by every new (<ref target="#CT148130.P54N6">6</ref>) <hi>Wrinkle</hi> in his <hi>Face,</hi> he is reported to gain ſome <hi>new Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In him we may obſerve the true Effects and Conſequences of <hi>Tyranny</hi> in a State: For, as he is a great <hi>Oppreſſor</hi> of all <hi>below</hi> him, ſo there is no Body more <hi>oppreſſed</hi> by thoſe <hi>above</hi> him:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1243900600:55"/>
Yet in this Time, he hath been ſo highly in Favour, that many <hi>Illuſtrious Perſons</hi> have been entirely indebted to <hi>him</hi> for their <hi>Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He hath diſcovered from his own Experience the true <hi>Point</hi> wherein all human Actions, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and Deſigns do chiefly <hi>terminate;</hi> and how <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>ſordid</hi> they are <hi>at the Bottom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It behoves the Publick to keep him <hi>quiet,</hi> for his <hi>frequent Murmurs</hi> are a certain Sign of <hi>inteſtine</hi> Tumults.</p>
            <p>No Philoſopher ever lamented more the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury, for which theſe Nations are ſo juſtly taxed; it hath been known to coſt him (<ref target="#CT148130.P55N7">7</ref>) <hi>Tears of Blood:</hi> For in his own Nature he is far from being <hi>Profuſe,</hi> tho' indeed, he never ſtays a Night at a Gentleman's Houſe without <hi>leaving ſomething behind him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He receives with g eat Submiſſion whatever his Patrons think fit to give him; and when they lay <hi>heavy Burthens</hi> upon him, which is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently enough, he gets rid of them as ſoon as he can; but not without <hi>ſome Labour</hi> and <hi>much Grumbling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is a perpetual <hi>Hanger-on;</hi> yet no Body knows how to be <hi>without him.</hi> He patiently fuffers himſelf to be <hi>kept under,</hi> but loves to be well uſed, and in that Caſe will ſacrifice his <hi>Vitals</hi> to give you <hi>Eaſe;</hi> and he has hardly one Aquaintance for whom he hath not been <hi>Bound;</hi> yet, as far as we can find, was never known to <hi>loſe</hi> any thing by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:1243900600:56"/>
He is obſerv'd to be very (<ref target="#CT148130.P56N8">8</ref>) <hi>unquiet</hi> in the Company of a <hi>Frenchman</hi> in <hi>New Cloaths,</hi> or a young <hi>Coquett.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is, in ſhort the Subject of much <hi>Mirth</hi> and <hi>Raillery,</hi> which he ſeems to take well enough, tho' it hath not been obſerv'd that ever any <hi>good Thing</hi> came from himſelf.</p>
            <p>There is ſo general an Opinion of his Juſtice, that ſometimes very <hi>hard Caſes</hi> are left to his Deciſion: And while he <hi>ſits</hi> upon them, he carries himſelf exactly <hi>even between both ſides,</hi> except where ſome <hi>knotty Point</hi> ariſes, and then he is obſerved to <hi>lean</hi> a little to the <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Left</hi> as the <hi>Matter</hi> inclines him, but his Reaſons for it are ſo manifeſt and convincing, that every Man approves them.</p>

            <head>THE WONDER Of all the Wonders, that ever the World won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at.</head>
            <head type="sub">For all Perſons of Quality and Others.</head>
            <p>NEWLY arriv'd at this City the famous Artiſt <hi>John Emanuel Schoitz,</hi> who to the great Surprize and Satisfaction of all Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, is ready to do the following Wonderful Performances, the like before never ſeen in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>He will heat a Bar of Iron red hot, and thruſt it into a barrel of Gunpowder before all the Company, and yet it ſhall not take fire.</p>
            <p>He lets any Gentleman charge a Blunderbuſs, with the ſame Gunpowder, and twelve Leaden Bullets, which Blunderbuſs the ſaid Artiſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges full in the Face of the ſaid Company, without the leaſt hurt, the Bullets ſticking in the Wall behind them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:1243900600:60"/>
He takes any Gentleman's own Sword, and runs it through the ſaid Gentleman's Body, ſo that the Point appears bloody at the back, to all the Spectators; then he takes out the Sword, wipes it clean, and returns it to the owner, who receives no manner of hurt.</p>
            <p>He takes a Pot of Scalding Oyl, and throws it by great Ladles full directly at the Ladies, without ſpoiling their Cloaths or burning their Skins.</p>
            <p>He takes any Perſon of Quality's Child from two Years Old to ſix, and lets the Child's own Father or Mother take a Pike in their Hands; then the Artiſt takes the Child in his Arms and toſſes it upon the Point of the Pike, where it ſticks to the great Satisfaction of all Spectators; and is then taken off without ſo much as a hole in his Coat.</p>
            <p>He mounts upon a Scaffold juſt over the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, and from thence throws down a great Quantity of large Tiles and Stones, which fall like ſo many Pillows, without ſo much as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſing either Perukes or Head-dreſſes.</p>
            <p>He takes any Perſon of Quality up to the ſaid Scaffold, which Perſon pulls off his Shoes, and leaps nine Foot directly down on a Board prepar'd on Purpoſe full of ſharp Spikes ſix Inches long, without hurting his Feet or Damaging his Stockings.</p>
            <p>He places the ſaid Board on a Chair, upon which a Lady ſits down with another Lady in her Lap, while the Spikes inſtead of entring into the under Lady's fleſh, will feel like a Velvet Cuſhion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:1243900600:61"/>
He takes any Perſon of Quality's Footman, tyes a Rope about his bare Neck, and draws him up by Pullies to the Cieling, and theſe keeps him hanging as long as his Maſter or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany pleaſes, the ſaid Footman to the Wonder and Delight of all Beholders, with a Pot of Ale in one Hand and a Pipe in the other; and when he is let down, there will not appear the leaſt Mark of the Cord about his Neck.</p>
            <p>He bids a Lady's Maid put her finger into a Cup of clear Liquor like Water, upon which her Face and both her Hands are immediately wither'd, like an Old Woman of fourſcore, her Belly ſwells as if ſhe were in a Week of her Time, and her Legs are as thick as Mill-Poſts; but upon putting her finger into another Cup, ſhe becomes as Young and Handſome as ſhe was before.</p>
            <p>He gives any Gentleman leave to drive forty Twelve-penny Nails up to the Head in a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's backſide, and then places the ſaid Porter on a Loadſtone Chair, which draws out every Nail, and the Porter feels no Pain.</p>
            <p>He likewiſe draws the Teeth of half a Dozen Gentlemen, mixes and jumbles them in a Hat, gives any Perſon leave to blindfold him, and raturns each their own, and fixes them as well as ever.</p>
            <p>With his Fore-finger and Thumb he thruſts ſeveral Gentlemen's and Lady's Eyes out of their Heads, without the leaſt Pain, at which time they ſee an unſpeakable Number of beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Colours, and after they are entertain'd to the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1243900600:62"/>
full, he places them again in their proper Sockets, without any Damage to the ſight.</p>
            <p>He lets any Gentleman drink a Quart of hot melted Lead, and by a Draught of prepared Liquor, of which he takes part himſelf, he makes the ſaid Lead paſs through the ſaid Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman before all the Spectators, without any Damage: After which it is produced in a Cake to the Company.</p>
            <p>With many other Wonderful Performances of Art, too tedious here to mention.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Artiſt has perform'd before moſt Kings and Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> with great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.</p>
            <p>He Performs every Day (except <hi>Sundays</hi>) from Ten of the Clock to One in the Forenoon; and from Four till Seven in the Evening, at the New Inn in <hi>Smithfield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Seat a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown, the ſecond a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Half-Crown, and the loweſt a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Shilling.</p>

            <head>To the RIGHT HONOURABLE The MAYOR and ALDERMEN of the City of LONDON: The Humble Petition Of the <hi>Colliers, Cooks, Cook-Maids, Blackſmiths, Jackmakers, Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers,</hi> and Others.</head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THAT whereas certain <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> Diſaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Government, and to the Trade and Proſperity of this Kingdom, taking upon them the Name and Title of the CATOPTRICAL VICTUALLERS, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, by Gathering, Breaking, Folding, and Bundling-up the <hi>Sun-Beams,</hi> by the help of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Glaſſes,</hi> to Make, Produce, and Kindle up ſeveral New <hi>Focus</hi>'s or Fires within theſe His Majeſty's Dominions, and thereby to Boil, Bake, Stew, Fry and Dreſs all ſorts of Victuals and Proviſions, to Brew, Diſtil Spirits, Smelt Oar, and in general, to perform all the Offices of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linary Fires; and are endeavouring to procure
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1243900600:64"/>
to themſelves the Monopoly of this their ſaid Invention. We beg leave humbly to repreſent to your Honours.</p>
            <p>That ſuch Grant or Patent will utterly Ruin and reduce to Beggery your Petitioners, their Wives, Children, Servants, and Trades on them depending; there being nothing left to them, after the ſaid Invention, but Warming of Cellars and Dreſſing of Suppers in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-time. That the aboliſhing ſo conſiderable a Branch of the Coaſting Trade as that of the Colliers, will deſtroy the <hi>Navigation</hi> of this Kingdom. That whereas the ſaid <hi>Catoptrical Victuallers</hi> talk of making uſe of the <hi>Moon</hi> by Night, as of the <hi>Sun</hi> by Day, they will utterly ruin the numerous Body of <hi>Tallow-Chandlers,</hi> and impair a very conſiderable branch of the <hi>Revenue</hi> which ariſes from the <hi>Tax</hi> upon Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and Candles.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid <hi>Catoptrical Victuallers</hi> do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane the Emanations of that Glorious Luminary the <hi>Sun,</hi> which is appointed to <hi>Rule the Day,</hi> and not to <hi>Roaſt Mutton.</hi> And we humbly conceive, it will be found contrary to the known Laws of this Kingdom, to Confine, Foreſtall, and Monopolize the Beams of the Sun. And whereas the ſaid <hi>Catoptrical Victuallers</hi> have undertaken by Burning-Glaſſes made of Ice, to Roaſt an Ox upon the <hi>Thames</hi> next Winter: We conceive all ſuch Practices to be an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon the Rights and Privileges of the <hi>Company</hi> of <hi>Watermen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Diverſity of Expoſition of the ſeveral Kitchens in this great City, whereby
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1243900600:65"/>
ſome receive the Rays of the Sun ſooner, and others later, will occaſion great Irregularity as to the <hi>Time of Dining</hi> of the ſeveral Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and conſequently great Uncertainty and Confuſion in the diſpatch of Buſineſs: And to thoſe who, by reaſon of their Northern Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, will be ſtill forced to be at the Expences of Culinary Fires, it will reduce the Price of their Manufacture to ſuch Inequality as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with common Juſtice: And the ſame Inconveniency will affect <hi>Landlords</hi> in the <hi>Value</hi> of their <hi>Rents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Uſe of the ſaid Glaſſes will oblige Cooks and Cook-maids to ſtudy Opticks and Aſtronomy, in order to know the due Diſtances of the ſaid <hi>Focus</hi>'s or Fires, and to adjuſt the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their Glaſſes to the ſeveral Altitudes of the Sun, varying according to the Hours of the Day, and the Seaſons of the Year; which Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, at theſe years, will be highly Troubleſome to the ſaid Cooks and Cook-Maids, not to ſay any thing of the utter Incapacity of ſome of them to go through with ſuch difficult Arts; or (which is ſtill a greater Inconvenience) it will throw the whole Art of <hi>Cookery</hi> into the Hands of Aſtronomers and Glaſs-Grinders, Perſons ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unskill'd in other parts of that Profeſſion, to the great Detriment of the <hi>Health</hi> of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's good Subjects.</p>
            <p>That it is known by Experience, That Meat Roaſted with Sun-Beams is extreamly unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; witneſs ſeveral that have dy'd ſuddenly after eating the Proviſions of the ſaid <hi>Catoptrical Victuallers;</hi> foraſmuch as the Sun-Beams taken
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1243900600:66"/>
inwardly, render the Humours too Hot and Aduſt, occaſion great Sweatings, and dry up the Rectual Moiſture.</p>
            <p>That Sun-beams taken <hi>inwardly,</hi> ſhed a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Influence upon the <hi>Brain,</hi> by their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Tendency towards the <hi>Moon;</hi> and produce Madneſs and Diſtraction at the time of the Full Moon. That the conſtant uſe of ſo great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of this <hi>Inward Light,</hi> will occaſion the Growth of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> to the Danger of the <hi>Church;</hi> and <hi>Poetry,</hi> to the Danger of the State.</p>
            <p>That the Influences of the Conſtellations, through which the Sun paſſes, will with his Beams, be convey'd into the <hi>Blood;</hi> and when the Sun is amongſt the Horned Signs, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch a Spirit of <hi>Unchaſtity,</hi> as is dangerous to the Honour of your Worſhips Families.</p>
            <p>That Mankind living much upon the Seeds and other Parts of Plants, theſe being impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Sun-Beams, may <hi>vegetate</hi> and <hi>grow</hi> in the Bowels, a Thing of more dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to human Bodies than Breeding of Worms; and this will fall heavieſt upon the Poor, who live upon Roots; and the Weak and Sickly, who live upon Barley and Rice-Gruel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which we are ready to produce to your Honours the Opinions of Eminent Phyſicians, That the Taſte and Property of the Victuals is much alter'd to the worſe by the ſaid <hi>Solar Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery,</hi> the Fricaſſes being depriv'd of the <hi>Haut Gout</hi> they acquire by being dreſs'd over Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal.</p>

               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Should it happen by an Eclipſe of an extraordinary Length, that this City ſhould be depriv'd of the Sun-Beams for ſeveral Months; how will His Majeſty's Subjects ſubſiſt in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, when common Cookery, with the Arts depending upon it, is totally loſt?</p>
            <p>In Conſideration of theſe, and many other Inconveniencies, your Petitioners humbly pray, That your Honours would either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally prohibit the Confining and Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Sun-Beams</hi> for any of the uſeful Purpoſes of Life, or in the enſuing Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment procure a <hi>Tax to be laid</hi> upon them, which may anſwer both the Duty and Price of <hi>Coals,</hi> and which we humbly conceive cannot be leſs than Thirty Shillings <hi>per</hi> Yard Square, reſerving the ſole Right and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the <hi>Catoptrical Cookery</hi> to the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and to the Commanders and Crew of the Bomb-Veſſels, under the Direction of Mr. <hi>Whiſton,</hi> for finding out the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude, who by Reaſon of the Remoteneſs of their Nations, may be reduc'd to Streights for want of Firing.</p>

            <head>REASONS Humbly Offer'd By the Company exerciſing the Trade and Miſtery of UPHOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERS, againſt Part of the BILL, <hi>For the better Viewing, Searching and Examining Drugs, Medicines,</hi> &amp;c. 1724.</head>
            <p>BEING call'd upon by ſeveral Retailers and Diſpenſers of <hi>Drugs</hi> and <hi>Medicines</hi> about Town, to uſe our Endeavours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Bill now depending, <hi>for Viewing,</hi> &amp;c. In regard of our common Intereſt, and in Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to the ſaid Retailers and Diſpenſers of Medicines (which we have always found to be very effectual) we preſume to lay the following Reaſons before the Publick, againſt the ſaid Bill.</p>
            <p>That the Company of Upholders <hi>are far from being averſe to the giving of Drugs and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines in general,</hi> provided they may be of ſuch Qualities as we require, and adminiſter'd by
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1243900600:69"/>
ſuch Perſons in whom our Company juſtly repoſe the greateſt Confidence: And provided they tend to the Encouragement of Trade, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the <hi>Woollen Manufacture</hi> of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>We beg Leave to obſerve, that <hi>there hath been no Complaint from any of the Nobility, Gentry and Citizens whom we have attended.</hi> Our Practice, which conſiſts chiefly in outward Applications, having been always ſo effectual, that none of our Patients have been oblig'd to undergo a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Operation. Excepting one Gentlewoman; who, after her firſt Burial, having burthen'd her Husband with a new Brood of poſthumous Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, her ſecond Funeral was by us perform'd without any farther Charges to the ſaid Husband of the deceas'd. And we humbly hope, that one ſingle Inſtance of this Kind (a Misfortune owing meerly to the Avarice of a Sexton in cutting off a Ring) will not be imputed to any Want of Skill, or Care, in our Company.</p>
            <p>We humbly conceive, that the <hi>Power by this Bill lodged in the Cenſors of the College of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> to reſtrain any of His Majeſty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from diſpenſing, and well-diſpoſed Perſons from taking what Medicines they pleaſe, <hi>is a manifeſt Encroachment on the Liberty and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Company exerciſing the Trade and Miſtery of Upholders, have an undiſputed Right in and upon the <hi>Bodies</hi> of all and every the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Kingdom; we conceive the paſſing of this Bill, though not abſolutely depriving them of their ſaid Right, might keep them <hi>out</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:1243900600:70"/>
               <hi>of Poſſeſſion</hi> by unreaſonable <hi>Delays,</hi> to the great Detriment of our Company and their numerous Families.</p>
            <p>We hope it will be conſider'd that there are Multitudes of neceſſitous Heirs and penurious Parents, Perſons in pinching Circumſtances, with numerous Families of Children, Wives that have lived long, many robuſt aged Women with great Jointures, elder Brothers with bad Underſtandings, ſingle Heirs of great Eſtates, whereby the Collateral Line are for ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, Reverſionary Patents, and Reverſionary Promiſes of Preferments, Leaſes upon Single Lives, and Play-debts upon joint Lives, and that the Perſons ſo aggrieved have no Hope of being ſpeedily relieved any other Way, than by the diſpenſing of <hi>Drugs</hi> and <hi>Medicines</hi> in the Manner they <hi>now are;</hi> Burying <hi>alive</hi> being judg'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the known Laws of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That there are many of the Deceaſed, who by certain mechanical Motions and Powers are carried about Town, who would have been put into our Hands long before this Time by any other well-order'd Government; By want of a due <hi>Police</hi> in this Particular, our Company have been great Sufferers.</p>
            <p>That <hi>frequent Funerals</hi> contribute to preſerve the Genealogies of Families and the Honours conferred by the Crown, (which are no where ſo well illuſtrated as on this ſolemn Occaſion;) to maintain <hi>neceſſitous Clergy,</hi> to enable the <hi>Clerks</hi> to appear in decent Habits to officiate on <hi>Sundays,</hi> to feed the great Retinue of <hi>ſober</hi> and <hi>melancholy Men</hi> who appear at the ſaid Funerals, and who
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1243900600:71"/>
muſt ſtarve without conſtant and regular Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Moreover we deſire it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd that by the paſſing of this Bill the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry will have their <hi>old Coaches</hi> lie upon their Hands, which are now employed by our Company.</p>
            <p>And we further hope that frequent Funerals will not be diſcouraged (as is by this Bill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) it being the only Method left of <hi>carrying</hi> ſome People to <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are afraid that by the Hardſhips of this Bill our Company will be reduced to leave their Buſineſs here, and <hi>practiſe at</hi> York <hi>and</hi> Briſtol, <hi>where the free Uſe of bad Medicines will be ſtill allowed.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:1243900600:74"/>
The <hi>Egyptians</hi> have repreſented this great Transformation by ſeveral ſignificant Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks, particularly one very remarkable. There are carv'd upon an Obelisk, a <hi>Barber</hi> and a <hi>Midwife;</hi> the Barber delivers his <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi> to the Midwife, and ſhe her <hi>Swadling Cloaths</hi> to the Barber. Accordingly <hi>Thales Mileſius</hi> (who, like the reſt of his Countrymen, borrow'd his Learning from the <hi>Egyptians</hi>) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having computed the Time of this famous Conjunction, <hi>Then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhall Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men mutually exchange the Pangs of</hi> Shaving <hi>and</hi> Child-bearing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anaximander</hi> modeſtly deſcribes this Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis in mathematical Terms: <hi>Then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhall the negative Quantity of the Women be turn'd into poſitive, their <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Plato</hi> not only ſpeaks of this great Change, but deſcribes all the Preparations towards it. <q rend="inline">"Long before the bodily Transformation (ſays he) Nature ſhall begin the moſt difficult Part of her Work, by changing the <hi>Ideas</hi> and <hi>Inclinations</hi> of the two Sexes: Men ſhall turn effeminate, and Women manly; Wives ſhall domineer, and Husbands obey; Ladies ſhall <hi>ride a Horſeback,</hi> dreſs'd like <hi>Cavaliers;</hi> Princes and Nobles appear in <hi>Night-rails</hi> and <hi>Petticoats;</hi> Men ſhall <hi>ſqueak</hi> upon Theatres with <hi>Female</hi> Voices, and Women <hi>corrupt Virgins;</hi> Men ſhall <hi>knot</hi> and <hi>cut Paper;</hi> and even the <hi>Northern</hi> People, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>: A Phraſe (which for Modeſty's Sake
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1243900600:75"/>
I forbear to tranſlate) which denotes a Vice too frequent amongſt us."</q> So far <hi>Plato.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Miniſtry foreſaw this great Change, is plain from the Callico-Act; whereby it is now become the Occupation of the Women all over <hi>England,</hi> to convert their uſeleſs Female Habits into Beds, Window-Curtains, Chairs, and Joint-ſtools; <hi>undreſſing</hi> themſelves (as it were) <hi>before their Transformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Philoſophy of this Transformation will not ſeem ſurpriſing to People, who ſearch into the <hi>Bottom</hi> of Things. Madam <hi>Bourignon,</hi> a devout <hi>French</hi> Lady, has ſhewn us, how Man was at firſt created Male and Female in one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, having the Faculty of Propagation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf: A Circumſtance neceſſary to the State of Innocence, wherein a Man's Happineſs was not to depend upon the Caprice of another. It was not till after he had made a <hi>ſaux pas,</hi> that he had his Female Mate. Many ſuch Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations of Individuals have been well atteſted; particularly one by <hi>Montaigne,</hi> and another by the late Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury.</hi> From all which it appears, that this Syſtem of Male and Female has already undergone, and may hereafter ſuffer ſeveral Alterations. Every Smatterer in Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my knows, that a Woman is but an introverted Man; a new Fuſion and <hi>Flatus</hi> will turn the hollow Bottom of a Bottle into a Convexity; but I forbear, (for the Sake of my <hi>Modeſt Men Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> who are in a few Days to be Virgins.)</p>
            <p>In ſome Subjects, the ſmalleſt Alterations will do: ſome Men are ſufficiently ſpread about the Hips, and contriv'd with that Female Softneſs,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1243900600:76"/>
that they want only the Negative Quantity to make them Buxom Wenches; and there are Women who are, as it were, already the <hi>Ebauche</hi> of a good ſturdy Man. If Nature cou'd be puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zl'd, it will be how to beſtow the redundant Matter of the exuberant Bubbies that now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear about Town, or how to roll out the ſhort dapper Fellows into well-ſiz'd Women.</p>
            <p>This great Conjunction will begin to operate on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 29th Inſtant. Accordingly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Eight at Night, as <hi>Senezino</hi> ſhall begin at the Opera, <hi>Si videte, Did you but ſee?</hi> He ſhall be obſerved to make an <hi>unuſual Motion;</hi> upon which the Audience will be affected with a <hi>red Suffuſion</hi> over their Countenance: And becauſe a ſtrong Succeſſion of the Muſcles of the Belly is neceſſary towards performing this great Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, both Sexes will be thrown into a <hi>profuſe involuntary Laughter;</hi> Then (to uſe the modeſt Terms of <hi>Anaximander</hi>) <hi>ſhall negative Quantity be turn'd into poſitive,</hi> &amp;c. Time never beheld, nor will it ever aſſemble, ſuch a Number of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd Virgins</hi> within thoſe Walls! but alas! ſuch will be the Impatience and Curioſity of People to act in their new Capacity, that many of them will go to pot that <hi>very Night.</hi> To prevent the Diſorders that may happen upon this Occaſion, is the chief Deſign of this Paper.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen have begun already to make uſe of this Conjunction to Compaſs their filthy Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. They tell the Ladies forſooth, that it is only parting with a periſhable Commodity; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſo much Value as a Callico Under-petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1243900600:77"/>
ſince, like its Miſtreſs, it will be uſeleſs in the Form it is now in. If the Ladies have no Regard to the Diſhonour and Immorality of the Action, I deſire they will conſider that Nature, who never deſtroys her own Productions, will exempt big-belly'd Women till the time of their Lying-in; ſo that not to be transform'd, will be the ſame as to be pregnant. If they don't think it worth while to defend a Fortreſs that is to be demoliſh'd in a few Days, let them reflect that it will be a melancholy thing Nine Months hence, to be brought to Bed of a Baſtard; a poſthumous Baſtard as it were, to which the <hi>Quondam</hi> Father can be no more than a <hi>dry Nurſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This wonderful Transformation is the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Nature, to balance Matters between the Sexes. The Cruelty of ſcornful Miſtreſſes ſhall be return'd; The ſlighted Maid ſhall grow into an imperious Gallant, and reward her Undoer with a big Belly, and a Baſtard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is hardly poſſible to imagine the Revolutions that this wonderful Phaenomenon will occaſion over the Face of the Earth. I long impatiently to ſee the Proceedings of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> as to the Title of Succeſſion to their Crown; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Caſe not provided for by the <hi>Salique</hi> Law. There will be no preventing Diſorders amongſt Friars and Monks; for certainly Vows of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity don't bind but under the Sex in which they were made. The ſame will hold good with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, tho' I think it will be a Scandal amongſt Proteſtants for Husbands and Wives to part, ſince there remains ſtill a poſſibility to perform the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:1243900600:78"/>
               <hi>Conjugale</hi> by the Husbands being <hi>femme Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verte.</hi> I ſubmit it to the Judgment of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Long Robe, whether this Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation does not diſcharge all Suits of <hi>Rapes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pope muſt undergo a new groping; but the falſe Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> has contriv'd Matters well for his Succeſſors; for as the Grand Signior has now a great many fine Women, he will then have as many fine young Gentlemen at his Devotion.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſurprizing Scenes, but I beg leave to affirm, that the ſolemn Operations of Nature are Subjects of Contemplation, not of Ridicule; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I make it my earneſt Requeſt to the merry Fellows, and giggling Girls about Town, that they would not put themſelves in a high Twitter, when they go to viſit a <hi>General</hi> Lying in of his firſt Child; his <hi>Officers</hi> ſerving as Midwifes, Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Rockers diſpenſing Caudle; or if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the <hi>Reverend Prelates</hi> dreſſing the Heads and airing the Linnen at Court, I beg they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that theſe Offices muſt be fill'd with Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the greateſt Regularity, and beſt Characters. For the ſame Reaſon, I am ſorry that a certain Prelate, who notwithſtanding his Confinement, ſtill preſerves his healthy, chearful Countenance, cannot come in time to be a <hi>Nurſe at Court,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I likewiſe earneſtly intreat the <hi>Maids of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> (then <hi>Enſigns</hi> and <hi>Captains</hi> of the <hi>Guards</hi>) that, at their firſt ſetting out, they have ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their former Station; and do not run wild through all the infamous Houſes about Town. That the preſent <hi>Grooms of the Bed-Chamber</hi> (then Maids of Honour) would not eat Chalk and Lime
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1243900600:79"/>
in their Green-Sickneſs; and in general, that the Men would remember that they are become <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremingent,</hi> and not by Inadvertency lift up againſt Walls and Poſt.</p>
            <p>Petticoats will not be burdenſome to the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;</hi> but Balls and Aſſemblies will be indecent for ſome Time.</p>
            <p>As for you, Coquettes, Bawds, and Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids, (the future <hi>Miniſters, Plenipotentaries</hi> and <hi>Cabinet-Counſellors</hi> to the Princes of the Earth) manage the <hi>great Intrigues</hi> that will be committed to your Charge, with your uſual Secrecy and Conduct; and the Affairs of your Maſter will go better than ever.</p>

            <p>You Houſewifely good Women, who now preſide over the <hi>Confectionary,</hi> (henceforth <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners</hi> of the <hi>Treaſury</hi>) be ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            <p>Ye Prudes and cenſorious old Maids, (the Hopes of the <hi>Bench</hi>) exert but your uſual Talent of <hi>finding Faults,</hi> and the Laws will be ſtrictly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; only I would not have you proceed upon ſuch <hi>ſlender Evidences</hi> as you have done hitherto.</p>
            <p>It is from you, eloquent Oyſter-Merchants of <hi>Billingsgate,</hi> (juſt ready to be call'd to the <hi>Bar,</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:1243900600:80"/>
and quoif'd like your Siſter-Serjeants,) that we expect the ſhortening the Time, and leſſening the Expences of Law-Suits: For I think you are oblig'd to bring your Debates to a <hi>ſhort Iſſue;</hi> and even cuſtom will reſtrain you from taking the <hi>Oyſter</hi> and leaving only the <hi>Shell</hi> to your Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I cannot but congratulate human Nature, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this happy Transformation; the only Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent left to reſtore the Liberties and Tranquility of Mankind; which is ſo evident, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an Affront to common Senſe to inſiſt upon the Proof of it. If there can be any ſuch ſtupid Creature who doubts it, I deſire he will make but the following obvious Reflection: There are in <hi>Europe</hi> alone, at preſent, about a Million of ſturdy Fellows, under the Denomination of <hi>ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Forces,</hi> with Arms in their Hands: That thoſe are Maſters of the Lives, Liberties and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of all the reſt, I believe no body will deny. It is no leſs true in Fact, that Reams of Paper, and above a ſquare Mile of Skins of Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum have been employ'd to no Purpoſe, to ſettle Peace amongſt thoſe Sons of Violence. Pray, who is he that will ſay unto them, <hi>Go and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band your ſelves?</hi> But lo! by this Transformation it is done at once, and the <hi>Halcyon</hi> Days of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tranquility return. For neither the Military Temper nor Dicipline can taint the ſoft Sex for a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1243900600:81"/>
whole Age to come. <hi>Bellaque matribus inviſa' Wars odious now to Mothers,</hi> will not grow immediately palatable in their <hi>Paternal</hi> State.</p>
            <p>Nor will the Influence of this Transformation be leſs in <hi>Family</hi>-Tranquility, than it is in <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> Great Faults will be amended, and Frailties forgiven, on both Sides. A Wife who has been diſturb'd with late Hours, and choak'd with the Haugoût of a Sot, will remember her Sufferings, and avoid the Temptation; and will, for the ſame Reaſon, indulge her Mate in his Female Capacity in ſome Paſſions, which ſhe is ſenſible from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience are natural to the Sex. Such as Vanity of fine Cloths, being admir'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt ſhe uſe her Mate under the Breeding Qualms and Labour-Pains, which ſhe hath felt her ſelf? In ſhort, all unreaſonable Demands upon Husbands muſt ceaſe, becauſe they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſatisfy'd from natural Experience that they are impoſſible. That the Ladies may govern the Affairs of the World, and the Gentlemen thoſe of their Houſhold, better than either of them have hitherto done, is the hearty deſire of,</p>

            <p>AMONG all the Enquiries which have been purſu'd by the Curious and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive, there is none more worthy the ſearch of a Learned Head, than the Source from whence we derive thoſe Arts and Sciences which raiſe us ſo far above the Vulgar, the Countries in which they roſe, and the Channels by which they have been convey'd. As they who firſt brought them amongſt us travell'd into the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Parts of the Earth to attain them, I may
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1243900600:84"/>
boaſt of ſome advantages by the ſame means; ſince I write this from the Deſerts of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> from thoſe Plains of Sand which have buried the Pride of Invading Armies, with my Foot perhaps at this inſtant ten Fathom over the Grave of <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> a Solitude to which neither <hi>Pythagoras</hi> nor <hi>Apollonius</hi> ever penetrated.</p>
            <p>It is univerſally agreed, that Arts and Sciences took their Riſe among the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Indians;</hi> but from whom <hi>they</hi> firſt receiv'd them, is yet a Secret. The higheſt Period of Time to which the Learned attempt to trace them, is from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Aſſyrian Monarchy,</hi> when their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors were worſhip'd as Gods. It is therefore neceſſary to go backward into Times even more remote, and to gain ſome knowledge of their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, from whatever dark and broken Hints may any way be found in ancient Authors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them.</p>
            <p>Nor <hi>Troy</hi> nor <hi>Thebes</hi> were the firſt of Empires; we have mention, tho' not Hiſtories, of an earlier warlike People call'd the <hi>Pygmaeans.</hi> I cannot but perſwade my ſelf, from thoſe Accounts of <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Ariſtotle</hi> and others, that their Hiſtory, Wars, and Revolutions were then a part of the Study of the Learned, from the very Air in which thoſe Authors ſpeak of them, as of things univerſally known. And tho' all we directly hear is of their Military Atchievements, in the brave defence of their Country from the annual Invaſions of a Powerful Enemy, yet I cannot
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1243900600:85"/>
doubt but that they excell'd as much in the Arts of peaceful Government, tho' there remain no Traces of their Civil Inſtitutions. Empires as great have been ſwallow'd up in the wreck of Time, and ſuch certain Periods have been put to them, as occaſion a Total Ignorance of their Story. And if I ſhould conjecture that the like happen'd to this Nation, from a general extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People by thoſe Flocks of Monſtrous Birds, wherewith Antiquity agrees they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually infeſted; it ought not to ſeem more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, than that one of the <hi>Baleares</hi> was waſted by Rabbits, <note n="*" place="bottom">Euſtathius in Hom. <hi>II.</hi> 1.</note>

            <p>Hence we ſee that the two Nations which contend for the Origine of Learning, are the ſame that have ever moſt abounded with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Race.

               <hi>Theocritus.</hi> If thus much be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, we eaſily account for two of the ſtrangeſt reports in all Antiquity. One, that the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Beaſts</hi> following the Muſick of <hi>Orpheus</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:1243900600:88"/>
(which has been interpreted of his taming Savage Tempers) will thus have a <hi>literal Application.</hi> The other, which we moſt inſiſt upon, is, that the Love which theſe Sages bear to the Females of our Kind affords a Solution of all thoſe Fables of the <hi>Gods compreſſing Women</hi> in Woods under <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial appearances.</hi> I am ſenſible it may be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that they are ſaid to have been compreſs'd in the Shape of different Animals; but to this we anſwer, that Women under ſuch apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions hardly know what ſhape they have to deal with.</p>
            <p>From what has been laſt ſaid, 'tis highly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that to this ancient and generous Race the World is indebted, if not for the <hi>Heroes,</hi> at leaſt for the acuteſt <hi>Wits</hi> of Antiquity. One of the moſt remarkable inſtances, is that great mimick Genius <note n="*" place="bottom">Vit. Aeſop. initio.</note>
               <hi>Aeſop,</hi> for whoſe extraction from theſe <hi>Sylveſtres Homines</hi> we may gather an Argument from <hi>Planudes,</hi> who ſays, that <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſignifies the ſame thing as <hi>Aethiop,</hi> the Original Nation of our People. For a ſecond Argument we may offer the deſcription of his Perſon, which was <hi>ſhort, deform'd,</hi> and almoſt <hi>Savage,</hi> inſomuch that he might have liv'd in the Woods, had not the benevolence of his Temper made him rather adapt himſelf to our Manners, and come to Court in wearing Apparel. The third Proof is his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and ſatyrical Wit; and laſtly, his great Knowledge in the <hi>Nature of Beaſts,</hi> together with the natural Pleaſure he took to ſpeak of them upon all Occaſions.</p>

               <hi>Socrates.</hi> Firſt, it was a Tradition that he was of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Birth from the reſt of Men; Secondly, he had a Countenance confeſſing the Line he ſprung from, being <hi>bald, flat-nos'd,</hi> with <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Eyes,</hi> and a <hi>downward look:</hi> Thirdly, he turn'd certain Fables of Aeſop into Verſe, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly out of his reſpect to Beaſts in general, and love to his Family in particular.</p>
            <p>In proceſs of time, the Women, with whom theſe Sylvans would have lovingly cohabited, were either taught by Mankind, or induc'd by an abhorrence of their Shapes, to ſhun their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces; ſo that our Sages were neceſſitated to mix with Beaſts; This by degrees occaſion'd the Hair of their Poſterity to grow higher than their Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles; It aroſe in one Generation to their Arms, in the Second it invaded their Necks, in the Third it gain'd the aſcendant of their Heads, 'till the degenerate Appearance in which the Species is now immers'd, became compleated. Tho' we muſt here obſerve, that there were a few who fell not under the common Calamity, there being ſome unprejudic'd Women in every Age, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of whom a Total extinction of the Original Race was prevented: And it is remarkable alſo, that even where they were mix'd, the Defection from their Nature was not intire; there ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd marvellous Qualities among them, as was maniſeſt in thoſe who follow'd <hi>Alexander</hi> in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</hi> How did they attend his Army and ſurvey his Order!

               </gap> an imitation was there of all his Diſcipline! the ancient true remains of a warlike Diſpoſition, and of that Conſtitution which they enjoy'd while they were a Monarchy.</p>
            <p>To proceed to <hi>Italy:</hi> At the firſt Appearance of theſe wild Philoſophers, there were ſome of the leaſt mix'd, who vouchſafed to converſe with Mankind; which is evident from the Name of <note n="*" place="bottom">Livy.</note>
               <hi>Fauns,</hi> a <hi>fando,</hi> or <hi>ſpeaking.</hi> Such was he who coming out of the Woods, in hatred to Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, encourag'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Army to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Hetruſcans</hi> who would have reſtor'd <hi>Tarquin.</hi> But here, as in all the Weſtern Parts of the World, there was a great and memorable <hi>Aera</hi> in which they began to be <hi>Silent.</hi> This we may place ſomething near the time of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> when the Number, Vanity and Folly of Human Philoſophers encreas'd, by which Men's Heads became too much puzzled to receive the Wiſdom of theſe ancient Sylvans; the Queſtions of that Academy were too numerous to be conſiſtent with their eaſe to anſwer; and too intricate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, idle, or pernicious, to be any other than a deriſion and ſcorn unto them. From this Period, if ever we hear of their giving Anſwers, it is only when <hi>caught, bound,</hi> and <hi>conſtrain'd,</hi> in like manner as was that Ancient <hi>Grecian</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Proteus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly we read in <note n="†" place="bottom">Plutarch in Vit. Sylla.</note>

            <p>But a more ſucceſsful attempt was made in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi>'s reign by the Inquiſitive Genius of the great <hi>Virgil,</hi> whom, together with <hi>Varus,</hi> the Commentators ſuppoſe to have been the true Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who are related in the 6th Bucolick to have caught a Philoſopher, and doubtleſs a genuine one, of the Race of the old <hi>Silenus.</hi> To prevail upon him to be communicative (of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of which <hi>Virgil</hi> was well aware) they not only ty'd him faſt, but allur'd him likewiſe by making him a preſent of a comely Maiden call'd <hi>Aegle,</hi> which made him ſing both merrily and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructively. In this Song we have their <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> the ſame in all probability as was taught ſo many Ages before in the great <hi>Pyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maean</hi> Empire, and ſeveral Hieroglyphical Fables under which they couch'd or embelliſh'd their Morals. For which reaſon I look upon this Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colick as an ineſtimable Treaſure of the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Science.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> we hear of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, taken in a Net, and brought to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> round whom the People flock'd to hear his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but as <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> reporteth, he prov'd a dumb Philoſopher, and only inſtructed by <hi>Action.</hi>

            <p>Theſe are all the Notices which I am at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent able to gather of the appearance of ſo great and learned a People in <hi>your ſide</hi> of the World. But if we return to their ancient native Seats, <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> we ſhall there find even in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern times, the Traces of their Original Conduct and Valour.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Africa</hi> (as we read among the indefatigable Mr. <hi>Purchas</hi>'s Collections) a Body of them whoſe Leader was inflam'd with Love for a Woman, by martial Powers and Stratagem won a Fort from the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi>

with all due reſpect <hi>Oran Outang</hi> the Great, the laſt of this Line: whoſe unhappy Chance it was to fall into the Hands of <hi>Europeans.

            <p>We muſt now deſcend to conſider this People, as ſunk into the <hi>bruta Natura,</hi> by their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Commerce with Beaſts. Yet even at this time, what Experiments do they not afford us of relieving ſome from the Spleen, and others from Impoſthumes, by occaſioning Laughter at pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Seaſons? With what readineſs do they enter into the imitation of whatever is remarkable in Human Life? and what ſurpriſing Relations have <hi>Le Comte</hi> and others given of their Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, Actions, Conceptions, Affections, Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Imaginations, and Abilities capable of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing them? If under their preſent low circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Breeding,</hi> and in ſo ſhort a Term of Life as is now allotted them, they ſo far exceed all Beaſts, and equal many Men; what Prodigies may we not conceive of thoſe, who were <hi>Nati melioribus annis,</hi> thoſe Primitive <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaeval</hi> and <hi>Antideluvian Man-Tegers,</hi> who firſt taught Sciences to the World?</p>
            <p>This Account, which is entirely my own, I am proud to imagine has traced Knowledge from a Fountain correſpondent to ſeveral Opinions of the Ancients, tho' hitherto undiſcover'd, both

by them and the Moderns. And now what ſhall I ſay to Mankind in the Thought of this great Diſcovery? What, but that they ſhould abate of their Pride, and conſider that the Authors of our Knowledge are among <hi>Beaſts:</hi> That theſe, who were our elder Brothers by a Day in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe Kingdom was like the Scheme of <hi>Plato</hi> govern'd by Philoſophers, who flouriſh'd with Learning in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> are now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſh'd from, and known only by the ſame Appellation, as the <hi>Man-Teger,</hi> and the <hi>Monkey!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to <hi>Speech,</hi> I make no queſtion that there are Remains of the Firſt and leſs corrupted Race, in their Native Deſerts, who yet have the Power of it. But the vulgar Reaſon given by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">"that they will not ſpeak for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet to Work,"</q> is alone a ſufficient one, conſidering how exceedingly all other Learned Perſons affect their <hi>Eaſe.</hi> A Second is, That theſe obſervant Creatures having been Eye-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the <hi>Cruelty</hi> with which that Nation trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Brother <hi>Indians,</hi> find it neceſſary not to ſhow themſelves to be <hi>Men,</hi> that they may be protected not only from Work, but from Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty alſo. Thirdly, They cou'd at beſt take no delight to converſe with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whoſe <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>ſullen</hi> Temper is ſo averſe to that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and open <hi>Chearfulneſs,</hi> which is generally obſerv'd to accompany all true Knowledge.</p>
            <p>But now were it poſſible, that any way cou'd be found out to draw forth their Latent Qualities, I cannot but think it wou'd be highly ſerviceable to the Learned World, both in reſpect of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering paſt Knowledge, and promoting the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

Might there not be found certain gentle artful Methods, whereby to endear us to them?

The Love I bear my native Country, prompts me to wiſh this Nation might be <hi>Great Britain,</hi> but alas! in our preſent wretched divided Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how can we hope that <hi>Foreigners</hi> of ſo great Prudence, will <hi>freely declare</hi> their Sentiments, in the midſt of violent <hi>Parties,</hi> and at ſo vaſt a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from their Friends, Relations, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?

            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, That Man is the moſt Mimick of all Animals; which Opinion of that great Philoſopher is ſtrongly confirm'd by the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of this wild Gentleman, who is endow'd with that Quality to an extream Degree. He receiv'd his firſt Impreſſions at Court: His
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1243900600:108"/>
Maners are, firſt to lick People's Hands, and then turn his Breech upon them; to thurſt his Hand into every body's <hi>Pocket;</hi> to climb over People's <hi>Heads;</hi> and even to make uſe of the <hi>Royal Hand,</hi> to <hi>take</hi> what he has a mind to. At his firſt Appearance he ſeiz'd on the Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain's Staff, and put on his Hat before the King; from whence ſome have conjectur'd, that he is either deſcended from a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> or the Earls of <hi>Kingſale</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> However, theſe are manifeſt Tokens of his innate Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he is extreamly tenacious of his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and ready to invade that of other People. By this mimick Quality he diſcover'd what wild Beaſt had nurs'd him: Obſerving Children to ask Bleſſing of their Mothers, one Day he fell down upon his Knees to a Sow, and mutter'd ſome Sounds in that humble Poſture.</p>
            <p>It has been commonly thought, that he is <hi>Ulrick</hi>'s natural Brother, becauſe of ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Manners, and the officious Care of <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> about him; but the Superiority of the Parts and Genius in <hi>Peter,</hi> demonſtrates this to be impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Though he is ignorant both of ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Languages, (that Care being left to the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Phyſician, who is entruſted with his Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) yet he diſtinguiſhes Objects by certain Sounds fram'd to himſelf, which Mr. <hi>Rotenberg,</hi> who brought him over, underſtands perfectly. Behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one day the Shambles with great Fear and Aſtoniſhment, ever ſince he calls Man by the ſame Sound which expreſſeth Wolf. A young Lady is a Peacock, old Women Mag-pyes and Owls; a
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1243900600:109"/>
Beau with a <hi>Toupee,</hi> a Monkey; Glaſs, Ice; Blue, Red, and Green Ribbons, he calls Rainbows; an Heap of Gold a Turd. The firſt Ship he ſaw, he took to be a great Beaſt ſwimming on her Back, and her Feet tied above her: The Men that came out of the Hold he took to be her Cubs, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd they were ſo unlike their Dam. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands perfectly the Language of all Beaſts and Birds, and is not, like them, confin'd to that of one Species. He can bring any Beaſt what he calls for, and no doubt is much miſs'd now in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Woods, where he us'd to do good Offices among his Fellow Citizens, and ſerv'd as a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator to reconcile their Differences. One Day he warn'd a Flock of Sheep that were driving to the Shambles, of their Danger, and upon uttering ſome Sounds, they all fled. He takes vaſt Pleaſure in Converſation with Horſes; and going to the <hi>Meuſe</hi> to converſe with two of his intimate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances in the King's Stable, as he paſs'd by, he Neighed to the horſe at <hi>Charing-Croſs;</hi> being as it were ſurpriz'd to ſee him ſo high, he ſeem'd to take it ill that the Horſe did not anſwer him; but I think no body can undervalue his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding for not being skill'd in Statuary.</p>
            <p>He expreſſeth his Joy moſt commonly by Neighing; and whatever the Philoſophers may talk of their Riſibility, Neighing is a more No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Expreſſion of that Paſſion than Laughing, which ſeems to me to have ſomething Silly in it; and beſides, is often attended with Tears. Other Animals are ſenſible they debaſe themſelves, by mimicking Laughter; and I take it to be a general Obſervation, that the top Felicity of Mankind is
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1243900600:110"/>
to imitate Monkeys, and Birds: Witneſs <hi>Harte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins, Scaramouches</hi> and <hi>Maſquerades;</hi> on the other Hand, Monkeys, when they would look extreamly ſilly, endeavour to bring themſelves down to Mankind. Love he expreſſeth by the Cooing of a Dove, and Anger by the Croaking of a Raven, and it is not doubted but that he will ſerve in Time as an Interpreter between us and other Animals.</p>
            <p>Great Inſtruction is to be had from this wild Youth in the knowledge of Simples; and I am of Opinion, that he ought always to attend the Cenſors of the College in their Viſitation of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries Shops.</p>
            <p>I am told that the new <hi>Sect</hi> of <hi>Herb-eaters</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to follow him into the Fields, or to beg him for a Clerk of their Kitchen: And that there are many of them now thinking of turning their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into Woods to Graze with the Cattle, in hopes to raiſe a healthy and moral Race, refin'd from the Corruptions of this Luxurious World.</p>
            <p>He ſings naturally ſeveral pretty Tunes of his own Compoſing, and with equal Facility, in the <hi>Chromatick, Inharmonick,</hi> and <hi>Diatonick</hi> Stile, and conſequently muſt be of infinite Uſe to the Academy, in judging of the Merits of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, and is the only Perſon that ought to decide betwixt <hi>Cuzzoni</hi> and <hi>Fauſtina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot omit his firſt Notion of Cloaths, which he took to be the natural Skins of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that wore them, and ſeem'd to be in great Pain for the pulling off a Stocking, thinking the poor Man was a Fleaing.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that there are diſaffected Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1243900600:111"/>
who ſay he is a <hi>Pretender,</hi> and no genuine wild Man. This Calumny proceeds from the falſe Notions they have of wild Men, which they frame from ſuch as they ſee about the Town, whoſe Actions are rather abſurd than wild; therefore it will be incumbent on all young Gentlemen, who are ambitious to excel in this Character, to Copy this true Original of Nature.</p>
            <p>The Senſes of this wild Man are vaſtly more acute than thoſe of a tame One; he can follow the Track of a Man, or any other Beaſt of Prey. A Dog is an Aſs to him for finding Troufles; his Hearing is more perfect, becauſe his Ears not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been confin'd by Bandages, he can move them like a Drill, and turn them towards the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norous Object.</p>
            <p>Let us pray the Creator of all Beings, Wild and Tame, that as this wild Youth, by being brought to Court, has been made a Chriſtian; ſo ſuch as are at Court, and are no Chriſtians, may lay aſide their Savage and Rapacious Nature, and return to the Meekneſs of the Goſpel.</p>

            <head>An INFALIBLE SCHEME To Pay the PUBLICK DEBT OF IRELAND in Six Months.</head>
            <p>THE great Diſtreſs of this unhappy <hi>Country,</hi> is too viſible to all, except thoſe who have Power to redreſs it.</p>
            <p>We may obſerve thro' the whole Nation one univerſal Complaint of the Decay of Trade, the Oppreſſion of Landlords, and the Deficiency of Money; and yet I cannot find among all the Schemes propoſed to leſſen theſe Evils, any one in particular, which ſeems likely to ſucceed.</p>
            <p>But, what is ſtill an Addition to this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Proſpect of Affairs, is the unbounded <hi>Luxury</hi> and <hi>Extravagance,</hi> both in Apparel and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1243900600:113"/>
Entertaiments, which Perſons of all Ranks and Degrees run into at preſent, tho' in general we labour under ſuch Hardſhips and Poverty.</p>
            <p>We are affected in a quite different Manner from all the Nations upon Earth; for, with others, <hi>Wealth</hi> is the Mother of <hi>Luxury,</hi> but with us <hi>Poverty</hi> has the very ſame Effect: With others, <hi>Scarcity</hi> is the Parent of Induſtry, but with us it is the Nurſe of <hi>Idleneſs</hi> and <hi>Vice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We labour to imitate our neighbouring King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in nothing but their Extravagance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having the ſame plentiful Aids of <hi>Commerce,</hi> or applying ourſelves to the Study of <hi>Fair-deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to maintain it. So that, in ſhort, by our own ill Management, we are brought to ſo low an Ebb of Wealth and Credit, that our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems incapable of any Relief.</p>
            <p>But as I have the Intereſt of this miſguided People very much at Heart, I do not intend this Eſſay as a Detection of their preſent Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but as a Remedy againſt them. And for that Purpoſe I have labour'd to find out ſuch a <hi>Scheme</hi> as will diſcharge our publick Debt with all poſſible Eaſe and Pleaſure to the Subject, and in ſo ſhort a Time, that we may neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of being oppreſſed with long continued Taxes, (as ſome unreaſonable People often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to do) nor quite deſpair of being once more in a thriving Condition.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider what thoſe <hi>Vices</hi> are, which at preſent prevail moſt among us; and I believe, upon Enquiry, they will be found <hi>Perjury, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, Drunkenneſs, Swearing, Slander, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, Fraud, Blaſphemy,</hi> and many others.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1243900600:114"/>
Would it not then be worthy of our Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether a moderate Tax upon every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Vice,</hi> inſtead of laying an additional Duty upon <hi>Wine, Hops,</hi> and other Commodities, wou'd not ſupply us with a ſufficient Sum in a very ſhort Time? Such a Tax muſt of Neceſſity yield a vaſt Revenue, and prove the moſt infallible, and indeed the only Scheme for our Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if it ſhall be thought proper to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued.</p>
            <p>But, before I proceed to Particulars, it may not be amiſs to premiſe, that this Tax is not deſigned for any one County or Province in this Kingdom, but to extend itſelf univerſally over the whole Nation; becauſe different Vices may flouriſh in different Counties, as different Plants in their different Soils; as <hi>Perjury</hi> in one, <hi>Theft</hi> in another, <hi>Diſſimulation</hi> and <hi>Flattery</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, <hi>Rapine</hi> in another, and ſo of the reſt: However, I take <hi>Theft</hi> to be our peculiar <hi>ſtaple Vice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And leaſt any Diſputes may hereafter ariſe about the Nature of <hi>Perjury,</hi> the Intention of the <hi>Act</hi> in this particular, or what Perſons are to be ſubject to this Tax, I muſt here alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that every <hi>Lie</hi> confirmed by an Oath, is undoubtedly <hi>Perjury,</hi> whether before a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,</hi> or behind a <hi>Counter.</hi> And, therefore, we do not doubt, but the Trading Part of our People, will be great Benefactors to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, in this particular Article, as well as many others.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Things being premis'd, let us
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1243900600:115"/>
ſuppoſe that in this large Country, 5000 Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are guilty of this Infirmity each Day-Which Computation muſt be allow'd very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, if we recollect that this Number is not above a four-hundredth Part of the Inhabitants of this Kingdom, who are generally computed to amount to <hi>Two Millions.</hi> And if we further conſider what ſtrong Inducements our Natives have to practiſe it, from its being often ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding beneficial; if we conſider the great Uſe made of it in all Sorts of <hi>Traffick;</hi> the great Demands for it in <hi>Law-ſuits;</hi> the great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it in <hi>Elections,</hi> and the undeniable Profit of it in all <hi>Proſecutions,</hi> we ſhall think the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 5000 ſtill more reaſonable.</p>
            <p>Let us then ſuppoſe every one of this Number to be perjur'd, only once every Day, (which is a very favourable Suppoſition) and ſubject only to a Tax of Sixpence for each Offence; for which Sum, perhaps, he may procure either the Death of an Enemy, an Eſtate for his Friend, or a Fortune for himſelf, (all which are eſteem'd very deſirable) the Tax will be too inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make any one murmur, and yet will yield the Sum of 125<hi>l. per Day,</hi> towards diſcharging our National Debt.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this Tax, tho' very low, may in Reality be very profitable for Mankind; for <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornies, Sollicitors, Uſurers, Butchers,</hi> and other honeſt Traders, will ſcarce think it anſwerable to the Expence of Time, to forſwear themſelves for any Profit from One Penny to Six Pence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, (as now cuſtomary) but will at leaſt,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1243900600:116"/>
for every Tranſgreſſion, expect to gain ſufficient to defray the Tax.</p>
            <p>However, I would have all ſworn <hi>Conſtables,</hi> and all <hi>Collectors</hi> of this and many other Taxes, entirely exempted from any Penalty as priviledg'd Perſons; becauſe by that Means they will be enabled to be very ſerviceable in their ſeveral Stations.</p>
            <p>Fornication, as the World is at preſent, would furniſh the Publick with a large Sum, even at a very moderate Tax; for it is now made an eſſential Part of the polite Gentleman's Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, and he that has prevail'd on the greateſt Number, proportionably riſes in Reputation.</p>
            <p>Let us then compute that in the ſeveral Parts of this Nation, 5000 <hi>per</hi> Day, were liable to be taxed for this general Vice, only at two Shillings: The Sum ariſing from this to the publick Good, will amount to 500<hi>l. per</hi> Day, and in Six Months to almoſt one Third of our National Debt.</p>
            <p>I know it may be here objected, that I have computed upon too ſmall a Number, and that I might juſtly account rather upon Twenty or Thirty Thouſand <hi>per</hi> Day, in the ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Kingdom: But, tho' I own this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to be very ſtrong, if we were to conſider the Opportunities of <hi>Wakes, Patron-Days, Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making</hi> Seaſons, <hi>May-Days, Religious Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to Holy Wells, Balls</hi> publick and private, and many other commodious Scenes for that kind of Entertainment; yet I would rather chuſe to err on the right Side in too ſmall, than too great a Computation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:1243900600:117"/>
I know the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy will make ſtrong Remonſtrances againſt this Tax; and plead, that it is deſign'd to oppreſs them; that all Nations of the Earth allow them a <hi>Toleration</hi> in this particular Point, as they are <hi>frail</hi> Mortals, and ſworn to <hi>Celibacy;</hi> and what is ſtill worſe, that ſuch a Tax would be the moſt effectual Means to drain them of their whole Revenues; but as I would not have ſuch pious Perſons juſtly complain of the leaſt Rigour, I ſhall readily agree to their being exempted.</p>
            <p>Drunkenneſs I would only Tax at Six Pence, becauſe it might be prejudicial to <hi>His Majeſty's Revenue,</hi> to diſcourage it, and conſequently ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Propoſer to Penalties.</p>
            <p>Let us then compute, that only Twenty Thouſand Perſons, (which is but one hundredth Part of the People in this Kingdom) were daily liable to be tax'd, the Amount would be 500<hi>l. per</hi> Day. And how extreamly moderate this Computation is, may appear to any one who conſiders, that beſides the uſual Opportunities of <hi>Taverns,</hi> and <hi>private Houſes,</hi> there are <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Fairs, Mayor</hi>'s <hi>Feaſts, Univerſity Treats, Corporation Dinners, Chriſtmas Regales, Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> and <hi>Chriſtnings,</hi> both in Town and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and many other irreſiſtible Inducements to this manly Vice, which would, perhaps, if nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calculated, daily furniſh us with two Thirds more than our computed Number, and by that Means greatly conduce to the Publick Good.</p>
            <p>But, however, I would by all Means exempt all Country <hi>Juſtices of the Peace,</hi> whether
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1243900600:118"/>
               <hi>Squires</hi> or <hi>Parſons:</hi> becauſe it would be unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſee ſuch honourable and reverend Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges inſulted by meaner Officers, as often as they might be diſcover'd in ſuch a Condition.</p>
            <p>Swearing would be a moſt univerſal Benefit in this Caſe; becauſe, at preſent, it ſerves to ſeaſon the Diſcourſe of all Ranks and Degrees of Men. It is the principal Ingredient and Decoration of all modern <hi>Jokes, Gibes, Quarrels, Love-Speeches, Diſputes, Threats</hi> and <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and conſequently capable of affording an incredible Revenue.</p>
            <p>However, let us ſuppoſe 40000 Perſons <hi>per</hi> Day, liable to the Tax of Six Pence only for each Offence of this Kind; which, conſidering the great Number of <hi>Markets, Coffee-Houſes, Shambles, Barracks,</hi> and <hi>Gaming-Houſes</hi> in this Kingdom, is a very inconſiderable Number; yet even this Article will furniſh us with 1000<hi>l. per</hi> Day, which would amount to near two Thirds of the publick Debt.</p>
            <p>Our Laws have amerced each Offence in this way at One Shilling, ordering one half to the Informer, and the other to the Poor, which, in my humble Opinion, was very ill concerted; for if the <hi>Legiſlature</hi> did really intend that this Law ſhould be punctually enforced, they ought to have divided the whole <hi>Mulct</hi> between the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former</hi> and the <hi>Juſtice,</hi> without any regard to the Poor, and then, they might be aſſured, it would be vigorouſly executed.</p>
            <p>I am already apprehenſive, that all military Perſons will expect an Exemption from Taxes on this Account; becauſe they may plead Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1243900600:119"/>
for many Generations, may alledge the Power of Cuſtom, the Decency and Comlineſs of it, when properly mingled with other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or that the cenſorious World would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſuſpect they knew nothing of <hi>God</hi> at all, if they did not ſometimes mention his Name; and many other Reaſons of equal Weight: But though theſe Remonſtrances are very juſt, yet as this is the only Means by which, ſome think a Standing Army can conduce to the national Good, it will be hard to exempt them.</p>
            <p>However, as the military Power would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly be liable to this Tax in all its Branches, by which Means they might be utterly impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd, I believe it may not be improper to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all <hi>Foot-Soldiers</hi> and <hi>Field-Officers,</hi> all young <hi>Enſigns,</hi> ſpruce <hi>Cornets,</hi> naval <hi>Captains, Cabin-Boys</hi> and <hi>Quarter-Maſters,</hi> forty or fifty Oaths a Day, entirely free from any Tax or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Slander,</hi> ſuppoſing only twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>per</hi> Day, taxed at Six Pence for every Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, this Article would daily afford the Publick (at the loweſt reaſonable Computation) five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds.</p>
            <p>And, as this is a favourite Talent, we might have ventur'd to tax it much higher; but I would not ſeem to diſcourage ſo charitable a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, eſpecially where it may promote the Intereſt of my Country.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Ladies,</hi> I have been always too great an Admirer of theirs, to deſire any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction ſhould be laid on their Pleaſure, either private or publick; and therefore I would have
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1243900600:120"/>
them tax'd only half as much as the Men for every little Error of this Kind; becauſe <hi>Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> in Men, is a Talent unnatural and acquired, and generally practiſed to ingratiate themſelves with the oppoſite Sex; whereas this genteel Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Females,</hi> is innate, and impoſſible to be reſtrain'd; which is a Caſe that demands our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Compaſſion.</p>
            <p>I think all <hi>Drawing-Rooms, Aſſemblies,</hi> and all Places of publick Reſort for Ladies, ought to be exempt from any Penalty, becauſe it is ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial a Part of the Diſcourſe and Amuſement of thoſe Places, that to tax them for each Offence, would be in Effect, to enjoin them perpetual Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; which, if it were poſſible, would be too great a Misfortune, both to themſelves and the World, to be exacted from them.</p>
            <p>Infidelity and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> would furniſh us with a conſiderable Sum; and as they are not originally of our own Growth, but annually imported from neighbouring Kingdoms, they ought to be ſubject to ſome Duty, which in few Years would probably be a vaſt Addition to the publick Revenue. Yet as this Traffick is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally carried on by young <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Squires,</hi> any Attempt to tax it would certainly meet with too vigorous an Oppoſition. But on condition it might paſs into a Law, I would gladly exempt both <hi>Lawyers</hi> of all Ages, <hi>Subaltern,</hi> and <hi>Field-Officers, young Heirs, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-Maſters, Pick-Pockets,</hi> and <hi>Players,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now only conſider the ſeveral Sums ariſing from the Tax on our <hi>Vices,</hi> as we have before computed them, and the Juſtneſs and

which in 182 Days or half a Year, will amount to 477,750<hi>l.</hi> which is conſiderably more than our National Debt.</p>
            <p>But, left by the univerſal Poverty of our People, which is much to be fear'd, or by their growing more virtuous, which never can be reaſonably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, this daily Income ſhould fall ſhort of what we have computed, I muſt humbly beg Leave to offer ſome other Improvements of this Scheme, which will undoubtedly anſwer all Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencies.</p>
            <p>And for this Purpoſe, what if a ſevere Tax was laid on all manner of Perſons who preſum'd to marry 'till they were full Forty Years old? If any ſhould prove Fool-hardy enough to tranſgreſs a Law ſo calculated for the Happineſs of Men, each Offence would be of ſignal Benefit to the Publick; and if providentially it ſhould prove an effectual

Reſtraint, there muſt of Neceſſity be fewer Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in each Family, and of Conſequence the Number of Beggars and Wretches in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom muſt proportionably decreaſe. And what would ſtill be more material, perhaps, in one Age, if this beneficial Act ſhould be continued, the greateſt part of this Country would require to be new peopled from <hi>E<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>d;</hi> a Circumſtance greatly to be wiſh'd; becauſe ſuch an Accident would probably cure that Nation of its inveterate Antipathy to the Inhabitants of this, at leaſt for ſome Generations.</p>
            <p>As for the Scheme to tax Batchelors, which has lately been propos'd to the Houſe by one of its Honourable Members, I muſt beg leave to think it highly improper; becauſe batchelors, of all Ranks and Degrees, are real Benefactors to the Publick, by not furniſhing it either with <hi>Beggars,</hi> or <hi>Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Beggars,</hi> one of which muſt infallibly be the Conſequence of Marriage in this Country.</p>
            <p>I would alſo earneſtly requeſt, that all young <hi>Clergymen,</hi> who, with more Paſſion than Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſhall dare to marry before they are bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd, may be liable to a moſt ſevere Tax, equal to a Prohibition; becauſe ſuch Offenders muſt inevitably multiply <hi>Beggars,</hi> live in <hi>Contempt,</hi> and die in <hi>Poverty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, and many other Expedients, might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be found upon any Emergency to furniſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Sums for the National Debt.</p>
            <p>But as there will remain about 177,750<hi>l.</hi> over and above our publick Debt, I will allow One Hundred Thouſand Pounds of it for Sallaries, to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1243900600:123"/>
ſuch Perſons as ſhall be appointed Collectors, and I hope this will be a reaſonable Proviſion, tho' ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally above one half of every Tax is expended in paying proper Officers to collect it. The Overplus may be depoſited in the Treaſury for any other pious Uſe.</p>
            <p>And if this Scheme ſhould be ſo fortunate as to ſucceed, as I have no Reaſon to doubt from the preſent Diſpoſition of the H<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

But I would, by all Means, have none but <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen</hi> nominated to be Tax Gatherers; becauſe we may rationally ſuppoſe, that they will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely free from Prejudice, in Favour of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Thus would a moderate Tax upon our <hi>Vices</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently contribute to ſave this Nation from utter Ruin. Many Perſons who have not the leaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for their Irregularities at preſent, (except the commendable Publick-ſpirited Contempt for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) might then plead in their own Defence, that their Immoralities had preſerved their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And by this Means we might be furniſh'd with a Multitude of <hi>Patriots,</hi> who probably would never prove ſo in any other Reſpect.</p>
            <p>But I muſt humbly beg leave to diſſent from that religious Gentleman, the excellent Author of the <hi>Fable of the Bees;</hi> though, perhaps, ſuch a Particularity of Opinion may injure my Character

            <p>IT is a melancholy Object to thoſe, who walk through this great Town or travel in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, when they ſee the <hi>Streets,</hi> the <hi>Roads</hi> and <hi>Cabbin-doors</hi> crowded with <hi>Beggars</hi> of the Female Sex, followed by three, four, or ſix Children, <hi>all in Rags,</hi> and importuning every Paſſenger for an Alms.

I think it is agreed by all Parties, that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious number of Children in the Arms, or on the Backs, or at the <hi>Heels</hi> of their <hi>Mothers,</hi> and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of their <hi>Fathers,</hi> is <hi>in the preſent deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate of the Kingdom,</hi> a very great additional Grievance; and therefore whoever could find out a fair, cheap and eaſy method of making theſe Children ſound and uſeful Members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, would deſerve ſo well of the Publick, as to have his Statue ſet up for a Preſerver of the Nation.</p>
            <p>But my Intention is very far from being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to provide only for the Children of <hi>profeſſed Beggars,</hi> it is of a much greater Extent, and ſhall take in the whole Number of Infants at a certain Age, who are born of Parents in effect as little able to ſupport them, as thoſe who demand our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Streets.</p>
            <p>As to my own Part, having turned my Thoughts, for many Years, upon this important Subject, and maturely weighed the ſeveral <hi>Schemes for no Projectors,</hi> I have always found them groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken in their Computation. It is true, a Child <hi>juſt dropt from its Dam,</hi> may be ſupported by her Milk, for a Solar Year with little other Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, at moſt not above the Value of two Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, which the Mother may certainly get, or the Value in <hi>Scraps,</hi> by her lawful Occupation of Begging; and it is exactly at one Year Old that I propoſe to provide for them in ſuch a Manner, as, inſtead of being a Charge upon their <hi>Parents,</hi> or the <hi>Pariſh,</hi> or <hi>wanting Food and Raiment</hi> for the reſt of their Lives, they ſhall, on the Contrary, contribute to the feeding, and partly to the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1243900600:127"/>
Cloathing of many Thouſands.</p>
            <p>There is likewiſe another great Advantage in my Scheme, that it will prevent thoſe <hi>voluntary Abortions,</hi> and that horrid Practice of <hi>Women murdering their Baſtard Children,</hi> alas! too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent among us, Sacrificing the <hi>poor innocent Babes,</hi> I doubt, more to avoid the Expence than the Shame, which would move Tears and Pity in the moſt ſavage and inhuman Breaſt.</p>
            <p>The number of Souls in this Kingdom being uſually reckoned one Million and a half. Of theſe I calculate there may be about two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Couple whoſe Wives are Breeders; from which number I ſubſtract thirty Thouſand Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, who are able to maintain their own Children, although I apprehend there cannot be ſo many, under <hi>the preſent Diſtreſſes of the Kingdom;</hi> but this being granted, there will remain an hundred and ſeventy Thouſand Breeders. I again ſubſtract fifty Thouſand, for thoſe Women who miſcarry, or whoſe Children die by accident, or diſeaſe within the Year. There only remain an hundred and twenty thouſand Children of poor Parents an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually born: The queſtion therefore is, How this number ſhall be reared, and provided for? which, as I have already ſaid, under the preſent Situation of Affairs, is utterly impoſſible by all the Methods hitherto propoſed; for we can <hi>neither employ them in Handicraft</hi> or <hi>Agriculture;</hi> we neither build Houſes, (I mean in the Country) nor cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate Land: They can very ſeldom pick up a Livelihood <hi>by Stealing</hi> 'till they arrive at ſix years old; except where they are of towardly parts; although, I confeſs, they learn the Rudiments
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1243900600:128"/>
much earlier; during which time they can how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be properly looked upon only as <hi>Probationers;</hi> as I have been informed by a principal Gentleman in the County of <hi>Cavan,</hi> who proteſted to me, that he never knew above one or two Inſtances under the Age of ſix, even in a part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>ſo renowned for the quickeſt Proficiency in that Art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am aſſured by our Merchants, that a Boy or a Girl before twelve years old, is no ſaleable Commodity, and even when they come to this Age, they will not yield above three Pounds, or three Pounds and half a Crown at moſt, on the Exchange; which cannot turn to Account either to the Parents or Kingdom, the Charge of Nutriment and Rags having been at leaſt four times that Value.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now therefore humbly propoſe my own Thoughts, which I hope will not be liable to the leaſt Objection.</p>
            <p>I have been aſſured by a very knowing <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> of my Acquaintance in <hi>London,</hi> that a young healthy Child well Nurſed, is, at a Year old, a moſt delicious nouriſhing and wholeſome Food, whether <hi>Stewed, Roaſted, Baked,</hi> or <hi>Boiled,</hi> and I make no doubt that it will equally ſerve in a <hi>Fricaſie,</hi> or a <hi>Ragouſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do therefore humbly offer it to <hi>publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,</hi> that of the Hundred and twenty thouſand Children, already computed, twenty thouſand may be reſerved for Breed, whereof only one fourth Part to be Males; which is more than we allow to <hi>Sheep, black Cattle,</hi> or <hi>Swine,</hi> and my Reaſon is, that theſe Children are ſeldom the Fruits of Marriage, <hi>a Circumſtance not much</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:1243900600:129"/>
               <hi>regarded by our Savages,</hi> therefore, <hi>one Male</hi> will be ſufficient to ſerve four Females. That the remaining Hundred thouſand may at a Year old, be offered in Sale to the Perſons of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> through the Kingdom, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways adviſing the Mother to let them Suck plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully in the laſt Month, ſo as to render them Plump, and Fat for a good Table. A Child will make two Diſhes at an Entertainment for Friends, and when the Family dines alone, the fore or hind Quarter will make a reaſonable Diſh, and ſeaſoned with a little Pepper or Salt will be very good Boiled on the fourth Day, eſpecially in <hi>Winter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have reckoned upon a Medium, that a Child juſt born will weigh 12 Pounds, and in a ſolar Year, if tolerably nurſed, encreaſeth to 28 Pounds.</p>
            <p>I grant this food will be ſomewhat dear, and therefore very <hi>proper for Landlords,</hi> who, as they have already devoured moſt of the Parents, ſeem to have the beſt Title to the Children.</p>
            <p>Infant's fleſh will be in Seaſon throughout the Year, but more plentiful in <hi>March,</hi> and a little before and after; for we are told by a grave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, an eminent <hi>French</hi> Phyſician, that <hi>Fiſh being a prolifick Dyet,</hi> there are more Children born in <hi>Roman Catholick Countries</hi> about nine Months after <hi>Lent,</hi> than at any other Seaſon; therefore reckoning a Year after <hi>Lent,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets will be more glutted than uſual, becauſe the Number of <hi>Popiſh Infants,</hi> is at leaſt three to one in this Kingdom, and therefore it will have one other Collateral Advantage, by leſſening the Number of <hi>Papiſts</hi> among us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:1243900600:130"/>
I have already computed the Charge of nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Beggar's Child (in which Liſt I reckon all <hi>Cottagers, Labourers,</hi> and four-fifths of the <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>) to be about two Shillings <hi>per Annum,</hi> Rags included; and I believe no Gentleman would repine to give Ten Shillings for the <hi>Carcaſs of a good fat Child,</hi> which, as I have ſaid, will make four Diſhes of excellent Nutritive Meat, when he hath only ſome particular Friend, or his own Family to dine with him. Thus the Squire will learn to be a good Landlord, and grow popular among his Tenants, the Mother will have Eight Shillings neat Profit, and be fit for Work 'till ſhe produces another Child.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who are more thrifty <hi>(as I muſt confeſs the Times require)</hi> may flea the Carcaſs; the Skin of which, Artificially dreſſed, will make admirable <hi>Gloves, for Ladies,</hi> and <hi>Summer Boots</hi> for <hi>fine Gentlemen.</hi>

            <p>As to our City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> Shambles may be appointed for this purpoſe, in the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Parts of it, and Butchers we may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red will not be wanting; although I rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend buying the Children alive, and dreſſing them hot from the Knife, as we do <hi>roaſting Pigs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A very worthy Perſon, <hi>a true Lover of his Country,</hi> and whoſe Virtues I highly eſteem, was lately pleaſed, in diſcourſing on this Matter, to offer a Refinement upon my Scheme. He ſaid, that many Gentlemen of this Kingdom, having of late deſtroyed their Deer, he conceived that the Want of Veniſon might be well ſupply'd by the Bodies of young Lads and Maidens, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1243900600:131"/>
fourteen Years of Age, nor under twelve; ſo great a Number of both Sexes in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try being now ready to ſtarve for want of Work and Service: And theſe to be diſpoſed of by their Parents if alive, or otherwiſe by their neareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. But with due deference to ſo excellent a Friend, and ſo deſerving a Patriot, I cannot be altogether in his Sentiments; for as to the Males, my <hi>American</hi> Acquaintance aſſured me from frequent Experience, that their Fleſh was generally Tough and Lean, like that of our School-boys, by continual Exerciſe, and their Taſte diſagreeable, and to fatten them would not anſwer the Charge. Then as to the Females, it would, I think, with humble Submiſſion, <hi>be a Loſs to the Publick,</hi> becauſe they ſoon would become Breeders themſelves: And beſides, it is not improbable that ſome ſcrupulous People might be apt to Cenſure ſuch a Practice, (although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very unjuſtly) as a little bordering upon Cruelty, which, I confeſs, hath always been with me the ſtrongeſt Objection againſt any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, how well ſoever intended.</p>
            <p>But in order to juſtify my Friend, he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that this Expedient was put into his Head by the famous <hi>Sallmanaazor,</hi> a Native of the Iſland <hi>Formoſa,</hi> who came from thence to <hi>London,</hi> above twenty Years ago, and in Converſation told my Friend, that in his Country, when any young Perſon happened to be put to Death, the Executioner ſold the Carcaſs to <hi>Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> as a prime Dainty, and that, in his Time, the Body of a plump Girl of fifteen, who was crucified for an Attempt to poiſon the Emperor,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:1243900600:132"/>
was ſold to his Imperial <hi>Majeſty's prime Miniſter of State,</hi> and other great <hi>Mandarins</hi> of the Court, <hi>in Joints from the Gibbet,</hi> at four hundred Crowns. Neither indeed can I deny, that if the ſame Uſe were made of ſeveral plump young Girls in this Town, who without one ſingle Groat to their Fortunes, cannot ſtir abroad without a Chair, and appear at a <hi>Play-houſe,</hi> and <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Fineries, which they never will pay for; the Kingdom would not be the worſe.</p>
            <p>Some Perſons of a deſponding Spirit are in great Concern about that vaſt Number of poor People, who are Aged, Diſeaſed, or Maimed, and I have been deſired to employ my Thoughts what Courſe may be taken, to eaſe the Nation of ſo grievous an Incumbrance. But I am not in the leaſt Pain upon that Matter, becauſe it is very well known, that they are every Day <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>rotting,</hi> by <hi>Cold</hi> and <hi>Famine,</hi> and <hi>Filth,</hi> and <hi>Vermin,</hi> as faſt as can be reaſonably expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And as to the young Labourers, they are now in almoſt as hopeful a Condition. They cannot get Work, and conſequently pine away for want of Nouriſhment, to a degree, that if at any Time they are accidentally hired to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Labour, they have not Strength to perform it, and thus the Country and themſelves are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily delivered from the Evils to come.</p>
            <p>I have too long digreſſed, and therefore ſhall return to my Subject, I think the Advantages by the Propoſal which I have made are obvious and many, as well as of the higheſt Importance.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Firſt,</hi> as I have already obſerved, it would
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1243900600:133"/>
greatly leſſen <hi>the Number of Papiſts,</hi> with whom we are Yearly over-run, being the principal Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Nation, as well as our moſt dangerous Enemies, and who ſtay at home on purpoſe with a Deſign <hi>to deliver the Kingdom to the Pretender,</hi> hoping to take their Advantage by the Abſence <hi>of ſo many good Proteſtants,</hi> who have choſen rather to leave their Country, than ſtay at home, and pay Tithes againſt their Conſcience, to an <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Curate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scecondly,</hi> The poorer Tenants will have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing valuable of their own, which by Law may be made liable to Diſtreſs, and help to pay their Landlord's Rent, their Corn and Cattle being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeized, and <hi>Money a thing unknown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whereas the Maintainance of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Children, from two Years old, and upwards, cannot be computed at leſs than Ten Shillings a piece <hi>per Annum,</hi> the Nation's Stock will be thereby encreaſed fifty thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> beſides the Profit of a new Diſh, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to the Tables of all <hi>Gentlemen of Fortune</hi> in the Kingdom, who have any Refinement in Taſte, and the Money will circulate among our Selves, the Goods being entirely of our own Growth and Manufacture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The conſtant Breeders, beſides the Gain of eight Shillings <hi>Sterling per Annum,</hi> by the Sale of their Children, will be rid of the Charge of maintaining them after the firſt Year.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:1243900600:134"/>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This Food would likewiſe bring great <hi>Cuſtom to Taverns,</hi> where the Vintners will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſo prudent as to procure the beſt Receipts for dreſſing it to Perfection; and conſequently have their Houſes frequented by all the fine <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi> who juſtly value themſelves upon their Knowledge in good Eating; and a skilful Cook, who underſtands how to oblige his Gueſts, will contrive to make it as expenſive as they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> This would be a great Inducement to Marriage, which all wiſe Nations have either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by Rewards, or enforced by Laws and Penalties. It would encreaſe the Care and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mothers towards their Children, when they were ſure of a Settlement for Life, to the poor Babes, provided in ſome Sort by the Publick, to their annual Profit inſtead of Expence; we ſhould ſoon ſee an honeſt Emulation among the married Women, <hi>which of them could bring the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Child to the Market.</hi> Men would become as <hi>fond</hi> of their Wives, during the Time of their Pregnancy, as they are now of their <hi>Mares</hi> in Foal, their <hi>Cows</hi> in Calf, or <hi>Sows</hi> when they are ready to farrow, nor offer to beat or kick them (as is too <hi>frequent</hi> a Practice) for fear of a Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p>Many other advantages might be enumerated. For Inſtance, the Addition of ſome thouſand Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes in our exportation of Barrel'd Beef: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of <hi>Swines Fleſh,</hi> and Improvement in the Art of making good <hi>Bacon,</hi> ſo much wanted among us by the great Deſtruction of <hi>Pigs,</hi> too frequent at our Tables, which are no way comparable in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1243900600:135"/>
Taſte, or Magnificence to a well grown, fat Yearly Child, which roaſted whole will make a conſiderable Figure at a <hi>Lord Mayor's Feaſt,</hi> or any other Publick Entertainment. But this, and many others, I omit, being ſtudious of Brevity.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing that one thouſand Families in this City, would be conſtant Cuſtomers for Infants Fleſh, beſides others who might have it at <hi>merry Meetings,</hi> particularly at <hi>Weddings</hi> and <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> I compute that <hi>Dublin</hi> would take off Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally about twenty thouſand Carcaſſes and the reſt of the Kingdom (where probably they will be ſold ſomewhat cheaper) the remaining eighty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>
            <p>I can think of no one Objection, that will poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be raiſed againſt this Propoſal, unleſs it ſhould be urged, that the Number of People will be thereby much leſſened in the Kingdom. This I freely own, and 'twas indeed one principal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in offering it to the World. I deſire the Reader will obſerve, that I calculate my Remedy <hi>for this one individual Kingdom of</hi> IRELAND, <hi>and for no Other that ever was, is, or, I think, ever can be upon Earth.</hi> Therefore let no Man talk to me of other Expedients: <hi>Of taxing our Abſentees at five Shillings a Pound: Of uſing neither Cloaths, nor Houſhold Furniture, except what is of our own Growth and Manufacture: Of utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Materials and Inſtruments that promote Foreign Luxury: Of curing the Expenſiveneſs of Pride, Vanity, Idleneſs, and Gameing in our Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: Of introducing a Vein of Parcimony, Prudence and Temperance: Of learning to love our Country, wherein we differ even from</hi> LAPLANDERS,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1243900600:136"/>
               <hi>and the Inhabitants of</hi> TOPINAMBOO: <hi>Of quitting our Animoſities, and Factions, nor act any longer like the</hi> Jews, <hi>who were murdering one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other at the very moment their City was taken: Of being a little cautious not to ſell our Country and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences for nothing: Of teaching Landlords to have at leaſt one Degree of Mercy towards their Tenants,</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Of putting a Spirit of Honeſty, Induſtry, and Skill into our Shop-keepers, who, if a Reſolution, could now be taken to buy only our Native Goods, would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the Price, the Meaſure, and the Goodneſs, nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair Propoſal of juſt Dealing, though often and earneſtly invited to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I repeat, let no Man talk to me of theſe and the like Expedients, 'till he hath at leaſt ſome Glimpſe of Hope, that there will ever be ſome hearty and ſincere Attempt to put <hi>them in Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, as to my ſelf, having been wearied out for many Years with offering vain, idle, viſionary Thoughts, and at length utterly deſparing of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, I fortunately fell upon this Propoſal, which, as it is wholly new, ſo it hath ſomething Solid and Real, of no Expence and little Trouble, full in our own Power, and whereby we can incur no Danger in <hi>diſobliging</hi> ENGLAND. For this kind of Commodity will not bear Exportation, the Fleſh being of too tender a Conſiſtence, to admit a long Continuance in Salt, <hi>although perhaps I could name a Country, which would be glad to eat up our whole Nation without it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all, I am not ſo violently bent upon my
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1243900600:137"/>
own Opinion, as to reject any Offer, propoſed by wiſe Men, which ſhall be found equally innocent, cheap, eaſy, and effectual. But before ſomething of that Kind ſhall be advanced in Contradiction to my Scheme, and offering a better, I deſire the Author or Authors, will be pleaſed maturely to conſider two Points. <hi>Firſt,</hi> As things now ſtand, how they will be able to find Food and Raiment for a hundred Thouſand uſeleſs Mouths and Backs. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> There being a round Million of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Humane Figure, throughout this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whoſe whole ſubſiſtence put into a common Stock, would leave them in Debt two Millions of Pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> adding thoſe, who are Beggars by Profeſſion, to the Bulk of Farmers, Cottagers and Labourers, with their Wives and Children, who are Beggars in effect; I deſire thoſe Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, who diſlike my Overture, and may perhaps be ſo bold to attempt an Anſwer, that they will firſt ask the Parents of theſe Mortals, Whether they would not at this Day think it a great Happineſs to have been ſold for Food at a Year old, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I preſcribe, and thereby have avoided ſuch a perpetual Scene of Misfortunes, as they have ſince gone through, by the <hi>Oppreſſion of Landlords,</hi> the Impoſſibility of paying Rent without Money or Trade, the Want of common Suſtenance, with neither Houſe nor Cloaths to cover them from the Inclemencies of the Weather, and the moſt ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable Proſpect of intailing the like, or greater Miſeries upon their Breed for ever.</p>
            <p>I proſeſs in the Sincerity of my Heart, that I have not the leaſt Perſonal Intereſt in endeavouring to promote this neceſſary Work, having no other
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1243900600:138"/>
Motive than the <hi>Publick Good of my Country, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing our Trade, providing for Infants, relieving the Poor, and giving ſome pleaſure to the Rich.</hi> I have no Children, by which I can propoſe to get a ſingle Penny; the youngeſt being nine Years Old, and my Wife paſt Child-boaring.</p>

            <head>A VINDICATION OF THE Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> THE Lord <hi>CARTERET,</hi> From the CHARGE of favouring <hi>Tories, High-Church-Men,</hi> and <hi>Jacobites.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN order to treat this important Subject with the greateſt Fairneſs and Impartiality, perhaps it may be convenient to give ſome Account of his Excellency, in whoſe Life and Character there are certain Particulars which might ſuggeſt a very juſt Suſpicion of ſome Truth in the Accuſation he lies under.</p>
            <p>He is deſcended from two noble, ancient, and moſt loyal Families, the <hi>Carterets</hi> and the <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villes,</hi> too much diſtinguiſhed, I confeſs, for
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1243900600:140"/>
what they acted, and what they ſuffered in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the former Conſtitution in Church and State, under King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr; I mean that very Prince, on Account of whoſe Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>a Form of Prayer with Faſting was enjoin'd by Act of Parliament, to be uſed on the Thirtieth Day of</hi> January <hi>every Year, to implore the Mercies of God, that the Guilt of that ſacred and innocent Blood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>might not be viſited on us or our Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> as we may read at large in our <hi>Common-Prayer-Books,</hi> which Day hath been ſolemnly kept, even within the Memory of many Men now alive.</p>
            <p>His Excellency the preſent Lord, was educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford;</hi> from thence, with a Singularity ſcarce to be juſtified, he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away more <hi>Greek, Latin,</hi> and Philoſophy, than properly became a Perſon of his Rank; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, much more of each, than moſt of thoſe who are forc'd to live by their Learning, will be at the unneceſſary Pains to load their Heads with.</p>
            <p>This was the Rock he ſplit on upon his firſt Appearance in the World, juſt got clear of his Guardians. For as ſoon as he came to Town, ſome Biſhops and Clergymen, and other Perſons moſt eminent for Learning and Parts, got him among them, from whom, though he were fortunately dragg'd by a Lady and the Court, yet he could never wipe off the Stain, nor waſh out the Tincture of his Univerſity Acquirements and Diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>To this another Miſsortune was added, That it pleaſed God to endow him with great natural
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1243900600:141"/>
Talents, Memory, Judgment, Comprehenſion, Eloquence, and Wit; and to finiſh the Work, all theſe were fortify'd, even in his Youth, with the advantages received by ſuch Employments, as are beſt fitted, both to exerciſe and poliſh the Gifts of Nature and Education, having been Ambaſſador in ſeveral Courts, when his Age would hardly allow him to take a Degree, and made Principal Secretary of State at a Period, when, according to Cuſtom, he ought to have been buſied in losing his Money at a Chocolate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, or in other Amuſements, equally laudable and epidemick among Perſons of Honour.</p>
            <p>I cannot omit another weak Side in his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, for it is known, and can be proved upon him, that <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Books might be found every Day in his Dreſſing-Room, if it were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſearched; and there is Reaſon to ſuſpect, that ſome of the ſaid Books have been privately convey'd to him by <hi>Tory</hi> Hands. I am likewiſe aſſured, that he hath been taken in the very Fact of reading the ſaid Books, even in the midſt of a Seſſion, to the great Neglect of publick Affairs.</p>
            <p>I own, there may be ſome Grounds for this Charge, becauſe I have it from good Hands, that when his Excellency is at Dinner with one or two Scholars at his Elbows, he grows a moſt inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and unintelligible Companion to all the ſine Gentlemen round the table.</p>
            <p>I cannot deny, that his Excellency lies under another great Diſadvantage; for beſides all the Accompliſhments abovementioned, having that of a moſt comely and graceful Perſon, he hath, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Prime of Youth, Spirits and Vigour, in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1243900600:142"/>
a moſt exemplary Manner led a regular, dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Life, diſcover'd a great Eſteem, Friendſhip and Love for his Lady, as well as a true Affection for his Children: And when he is diſpos'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an entertaining Evening Companion, he doth not always enough reflect whether the Perſon may poſſibly in former Days have lain under the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a <hi>Tory?</hi> Nor at ſuch Times do the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or affected Fears of <hi>Popery</hi> and the <hi>Pretender</hi> make any Part of the Converſation: I preſume, becauſe neither <hi>Homer, Plato, Ariſtotle,</hi> nor <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> have made any mention of them.</p>
            <p>Theſe I freely acknowledge to be his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's Failings; yet, I think, it is agreed by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers and Divines, that ſome Allowance ought to be given to human Infirmity, and the Prejudices of a wrong Education.</p>
            <p>I am well aware how much my Sentiments differ from the orthodox Opinion of one or two principal Patriots; for theſe have decided the Matter directly againſt me, by declaring, that no Perſon, who was ever known to lie under the Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of one ſingle <hi>Tory</hi> Principle, or who had been once ſeen at a great Man's Levee in the <hi>worſt of Times,</hi> ſhould be allow'd to come within the Verge of the Caſtle; much leſs to bow in the Anti-Chamber, appear at the <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> or dance at a Birth-Night. However, I dare aſſert, that this Maxim hath been often controul'd, and that, on the contrary, a conſiderable Number of <hi>early Penitents</hi> have been received into Grace, who are now an <hi>Ornament, Happineſs,</hi> and <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> to the Nation.</p>
            <p>Neither do I find any Murmuring on ſome
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1243900600:143"/>
other Points of greater Importance, where this favourite Maxim is not ſo ſtrictly obſerved.</p>
            <p>To inſtance only in one. I have not heard that any Care hath hitherto been taken to diſcover whether <note n="*" place="bottom">A famous Rope-dancer.</note>Madam <hi>Violante</hi> be a <hi>Whig</hi> or <hi>Tory</hi> in her Principles, or even that ſhe hath ever been <hi>offer'd the Oaths to the Governmem t;</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I am told, that ſhe openly profeſſeth her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a <hi>High-Flyer;</hi> and it is not improbable, but by her <hi>Outlandiſh</hi> Name ſhe may alſo be a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi> in her Heart. Yet we ſee this illu ſtrious and dangerous Female openly careſs'd by principal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of both Parties, who contribute to ſupport her in a ſplendid Manner, without the leaſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions from a <hi>Grand Jury.</hi> And as <hi>Hobbs</hi> wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerves, <hi>ſo much Money</hi> being equivalent to <hi>ſo much Power,</hi> it may deſerve conſidering with what Safety ſuch an Inſtrument of <hi>Power</hi> ought to be truſted in the Hands of an <hi>Alien,</hi> who hath not given any legal Security for her good Affection to the Government.</p>
            <p>I confeſs there is one Evil, which I could wiſh our Friends would think proper to redreſs. There are many <hi>Whigs</hi> in this Kingdom of the <hi>old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhion'd Stamp,</hi> of whom we might make very good Uſe; they bear the ſame Loyalty with us. to the <hi>Hanoverian</hi> Family, in the Perſon of King <hi>George</hi> the Second; the ſame Abhorrence of the <hi>Pretender,</hi> with the Conſequents of <hi>Popery</hi> and Slavery; and the ſame Indulgence to <hi>tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences;</hi> but having nothing to ask for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and conſequently the more Leiſure to think for the Publick; they are often apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1243900600:144"/>
Fears and melancholy Proſpects concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the State of their Country, the Decay of Trade, the Want of Money, the miſerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the People, with other Topicks of like Nature, all which do equally concern both <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory,</hi> who, if they have any Thing to loſe, muſt be equally Sufferers. Perhaps one or two of theſe melanchly Gentlemen will ſometimes ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to publiſh their Thoughts in Print: Now, I can by no Means approve our uſual Cuſtom of curſing and railing at this Species of Thinkers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Names of <hi>Tories, Jacobites, Papiſts, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers, Rebels,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>This was the utter Ruin of that poor, angry, buſtling, well-meaning Mortal <hi>Piſtorides,</hi> who lies equally under the Contempt of both Parties, with no other Difference than a Mixture of <hi>Pity</hi> on one Side and of <hi>Averſion</hi> on the other.</p>
            <p>How hath he been pelted, peſter'd and pounded by one ſingle Wag, who promiſeth never to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him living or dead.</p>
            <p>I was much pleaſed with the Humour of a <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon</hi> in this Town, who, having in his own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions received ſome great Injuſtice from the Earl of <hi>Galloway,</hi> and deſparing of Revenge, as well as Relief, declared to all his Friends, that he had ſet apart a hundred Guineas to purchaſe the Earl's Carcaſs from the Sexton, whenever I T ſhould die, to make a Skeleton of the Bones, ſtuff the Hide, and ſhew them for three Pence; and thus get Vengeance for the Injuries he had ſuffer'd by the owner.</p>
            <p>Of the like Spirit too often is that implacable Race of Wits, againſt whom there is no Defence
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1243900600:145"/>
but Innocence and Philoſophy, neither of which is likely to be at Hand, and therefore the Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have no where to fly for a Cure, but to down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Stupidity, a crazed Head, or a profligate Contempt of Guilt and Shame.</p>
            <p>I am therefore ſorry for that other miſerable Creature <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <hi>Traulus,</hi> who altho' of ſomewhat a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Species, yet ſeems very far to out-do even the Genius of <hi>Piſtorides</hi> in that miſcarrying Talent of Railing without Conſiſtency or Diſcretion, againſt the moſt innocent Perſons, according to the preſent Situation of his Gall and Spleen. I do not blame an <hi>honeſt</hi> Gentleman for the bittereſt Invectives againſt one to whom he profeſſeth the greateſt Friendſhip, provided he acts in the Dark, ſo as not to be diſcovered; but in the midſt of <hi>Careſſes, Viſits,</hi> and <hi>Invitations,</hi> to run into the Streets, or to <hi>as publick a Place,</hi> and without the leaſt pretended Incitement, ſputter out the baſeſt and falſeſt Accuſations, then to wipe his Mouth, come up ſmiling to his Friend, ſhake him by the Hand, and tell him in a Whiſper, it was <hi>all for his Service:</hi> This Proceeding I am bold to think a great Failure in Prudence, and I am afraid leſt ſuch a Practitioner, with a Body ſo <hi>open,</hi> ſo <hi>foul,</hi> and <hi>ſo full of Sores,</hi> may fall under the Reſentmen of an incens'd political <hi>Surgeon,</hi> who is not in much Renown for his Mercy upon great Provocation, who without waiting for his Death, will flay and diſſect him alive, and to the View of Mankind lay open all the diſorder'd Cells of his Brain, the Vonom of his Tongue, the Corruption of his
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1243900600:146"/>
Heart, and Spots and Flatuſes of his Spleen—and all this for three Pence.</p>
            <p>In ſuch a Caſe, what a Scene would be laid open? And to drop my Metaphor, what a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of our miſtaken Friend might an angry Enemy draw and expoſe? Particularizing that unnatural Conjunction of Vices and Follies ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with each other in the ſame Breaſt: Furious and fawning, ſcurrilous and flattering, cowardly and provoking, inſolent and abject; moſt profligately ſalſe, with the ſtrongeſt Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Sincerity; poſitive and variable, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical and ſlaviſh.</p>
            <p>In vain would his Excuſers endeavour to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate his Enormities, by imputing them to Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, beauſe it is well knowm, that Madneſs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly operates by inflaming and enlarging the good or evil Diſpoſitions of the Mind; for the Curators of <hi>Bedlam</hi> aſſure us, that ſome Lunaticks are Perſons of <hi>Honour, Truth, Benevolence,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Virtues, which appear in their higheſt Ravings, although after a wild incoherent Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, while others on the contrary diſcover in every Word and action the utmoſt <hi>Baſeneſs</hi> and Depravity of human Minds; which infallibly they poſſeſſed in the ſame Degree, although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps under a better Regulation, before their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into that <hi>Academy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be objected, that there is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of much more Force to excuſe the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of that zeal which our <hi>Friend</hi> ſhews or means for our Cauſe. And it muſt be confeſſed, that the <hi>eaſy and ſmooth Fluency of his Elocution beſtowed on him by Nature, and cultivated by</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:1243900600:147"/>
               <hi>continual Practice,</hi> added to the <hi>Comelyneſs of his Perſon, the Harmony of his Voice,</hi> the <hi>Graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Manner,</hi> and the <hi>Decency of his Dreſs,</hi> are Temptations too ſtrong for ſuch a Genius to reſiſt upon any publick Occaſion of making them appear with <hi>univerſal Applauſe.</hi> And if good Men are ſometimes accuſed of loving their <hi>Jeſt</hi> better than their <hi>Friend,</hi> ſurely to gain the Reputation of the firſt <hi>Orator</hi> in the Kingdom, no Man of Spirit would ſcruple to loſe all the <hi>Friends</hi> he had in the World.</p>
            <p>It is uſual for Maſters to make their Boys de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim on both Sides of an Argument; and as ſome kinds of Aſſemblies are called the <hi>Schools of Principles,</hi> I confeſs nothing can better improve political School-Boys, than the Art of making plauſible or implauſible Harangues againſt the very Opinion for which they reſolve to determine.</p>
            <p>So Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> after having ſpoke for an Hour to the Admiration of all his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to prove the Exiſtence of God, told ſome of his Intimates, that he could have ſpoken another Hour, and much better, to prove the contrary.</p>
            <p>To return from this long Digreſſion: If Perſons in high Sations have been allow'd to chuſe Miſtreſſes, without Regard even to Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Religion, yet never incurred the leaſt Reflection on their Loyalty or their Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; ſhall the chief Govenour of a great Kingdom be cenſured for chuſing a <hi>Companion,</hi> who may formerly have been ſuſpected for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the <hi>Orthodox</hi> in ſome ſpeculative Opinions of Perſons and Things, which cannot
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1243900600:148"/>
affect the fundamental Principles of a ſound <hi>Whig?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let me ſuppoſe a very poſſible Caſe. Here is a Perſon ſent to govern <hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe unfortunate weak Side it happens to be, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Reaſons abovemention'd, that he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the Attendance of <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men diſtinguiſhed for their Taſte, their Wit, and their Learning; who have taken the Oaths to his Majeſty, and pray heartily for him; yet, becauſe they may perhaps be ſtigmatized as <hi>quondam</hi> Tories by <hi>Piſtorides</hi> and his Gang, his Excellency muſt be forced to baniſh them under the Pain and Peril of diſpleaſing the Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots of his own Party, and thereby, be put into a worſe Condition than every common Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow; who may be a ſincere <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and a loyal Subject; and yet rather chuſe to drink fine Ale at the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Head,</hi> than muddy at the <hi>King</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>Let me then return to my Suppoſition. It is certain, the High-flown Loyaliſts in the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> Senſe of the Word, have their Thoughts, and Studies, and Tongues, ſo entirely diverted by political Schemes, that the Zeal of their <hi>Principles</hi> hath <hi>eaten up</hi> their Underſtandings; neither have they Time from their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their Hopes, and their hourly Labours, for acquiring new Additions of Merit; to amuſe themſelves with philological Converſe, or Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which are utterly ruinous to all Schemes of riſing in the World: What muſt then a Great Man do, whoſe ill Stars have fatally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted him to a Love, and Taſte, and Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1243900600:149"/>
of Literature, Politeneſs and good Senſe? Our thorough-ſped Republick of <hi>Whigs,</hi> which contains the Bulk of all <hi>Hopers, Pretenders, Expectors</hi> and <hi>Poſſeſſors,</hi> are, beyond all Doubt, moſt <hi>highly uſeful</hi> to Princes, to Govenours, to great Miniſters, and to their Country; but at the ſame Time, and by neceſſary Conſequence, the moſt diſagreable Companions to all who have that unfortunate Turn of Mind peculiar to his Excellency, and perhaps to five or ſix more in a Nation.</p>
            <p>I do not deny it poſſible, that an Original or Proſelyte Favourer of the Times might have been born to theſe uſeleſs Talents, which in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages qualified a Man to be a Poet, or a Philoſopher. All I contend for is, that where the true Genius of Party once enters, it <hi>ſweeps the Houſe clean,</hi> and leaves Room for many <hi>other Spirits,</hi> to take joint Poſſeſſion 'till the <hi>laſt State of that Man is exceedingly better than the firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I allow it a great Error in his Excellency, that he adheres ſo obſtinately to his old unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable academick Education: Yet ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is human Nature, that the uſual Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for this Evil in others, have produced a contrary Effect in him; to a Degree that I am credibly informed, he will, as I have already hinted, in the Middle of a Seſſion, quote Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages out of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Pindar</hi> at his own Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſome <hi>Book-learn'd</hi> Companion without Bluſhing, even when Perſons of <hi>great Stations</hi> are by.</p>
            <p>I will venture one Step farther, which is, freely to confeſs, that this miſtaken Method of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1243900600:150"/>
educating Youth in the Knowledge of ancient Learning and Language, is too apt to ſpoil their <hi>Politicks</hi> and <hi>Principles?</hi> becauſe, the Doctrine and Examples of the Books they read, teach them Leſſons <hi>directly contrary in every Point</hi> to the <hi>preſent Practice</hi> of the World: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, <hi>Hobbes</hi> moſt judiciouſly obſerves, that the Writings of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> made young Men imbibe Opinions againſt <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power</hi> in a <hi>Prince,</hi> or even in a firſt <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> and to embrace Notions of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath been therefore a great Felicity to theſe Kingdoms, that the Heirs to Titles and large Eſtates have a Weakneſs in their Eyes, and a Tenderneſs in their Conſtitutions, are not able to bear the Pain and Indignity of Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and, as the Mother rightly expreſſes it, could never take to their Books; yet are well enough qualified to ſign a Receipt for half a Year's Rent, to put their Name <hi>(rightly ſpelt)</hi> to a Warrant, and to read Pamphlets againſt <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>High-Flying;</hi> whereby they fill their Niches, and carry themſelves through the World with that Dignity which beſt becomes a Senator, and a <hi>Squire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could heartily wiſh his Excellency would be more condeſcending to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Kingdom he Governs, to the Condition of the Times, and to the Nature of the Station he ſills. Yet if it be true, what I have read in old <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Story-Books, that one <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> (no Matter to the Bulk of my Readers whether I ſpell the Name right or wrong) was caught by the <hi>Parſon</hi>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:1243900600:151"/>
               <hi>of the Pariſh,</hi> riding on a Hobby-Horſe with his Children; that <hi>Socrates</hi> a <hi>Heathen</hi> Philoſopher was found dancing by himſelf at Fourſcore; that a King called <hi>Caeſar Auguſtus</hi> (or ſome ſuch Name) uſed to play with Boys, whereof ſome might poſſibly be Sons of <hi>Tories;</hi> and two great Men called <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> (I forget their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Names, and whether they were Poets or Generals,) often play'd at Duck and Drake with ſmooth Stones on a River: Now, I ſay, if theſe Facts be true, (and the Book where I found them is in Print) I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine why our moſt zealous Patriots may not a little indulge his Excellency, in an Infirmity which is not mortally Evil, provided he gives no publick Scandal (which is by all Means to be avoided:) I ſay, why he may not be indulged twice a Week to converſe with one or two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, and let him and them conn over their old <hi>exploded</hi> Readings together, after Mornings ſpent in hearing and preſcribing Ways and Means from and to his <hi>moſt obedient</hi> Politicians for the Welfare of the Kingdom; although the ſaid particular Perſon or Perſons may not have made ſo publick a Declaration of their political Faith in all its Parts, as the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Nation requires; ſtill ſubmitting my Opinion to that <hi>happy Majority,</hi> which I am confident is <hi>always in the right;</hi> by whom the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Subject hath been ſo frequently, ſo ſtrenuouſly, and ſo ſucceſsfully aſſerted; who by their wiſe Councils have made <hi>Commerce</hi> to flouriſh, <hi>Money</hi> to abound, <hi>Inhabitants</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1243900600:152"/>
the <hi>Value</hi> of <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Rents</hi> to riſe, and the whole Iſland put on a new Face of <hi>Plenty</hi> and Proſperity.</p>
            <p>But in order to clear his Excellency more fully from this Accuſation of ſhewing his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to <hi>High-flyers, Tories</hi> and <hi>Jacobites,</hi> it will be neceſſary to come to Particulars.</p>
            <p>The firſt Perſon of a <hi>Tory</hi> Denomination, to whom his Excellency gave any Marks of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, was Doctor <hi>Thomas Sheridan.</hi> It is to be obſerved, that this happened ſo early in his Exellency's Government, as it may be juſtly ſuppoſed he had not been informed of that Gentleman's Character upon ſo <hi>dangerous</hi> an Article. The Doctor being well known and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd for his Skill and Succeſs in the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Youth, beyond moſt of his Profeſſion for many Years paſt; was recommended to his Excellency on the Score of his Learning, and particularly for his Knowledge in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, whereof it ſeems his Excellency is a great Admirer, although for what Reaſons I could never imagine. However it is agreed on all Hands, that his Lordſhip was too eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd on by the Doctor's Requeſt, or indeed rather from the Biaſs of his own Nature, to hear a Tragedy acted in that <hi>unknown</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage by the Doctor's Lads, which was written by ſome <hi>Heathen</hi> Author; but whether it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any <hi>Tory</hi> or <hi>High-Church</hi> Principles, muſt be left to the Conſciences of the <hi>Boys,</hi> the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and his Excellency; the only Witneſſes in this Caſe whoſe Teſtimonies can be depended upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:1243900600:153"/>
It ſeems, his Excellency (a Thing never to be ſufficiently wonder'd at) was ſo pleas'd with his entertainment, that ſome Time after he gave the Doctor a Church Living, to the Value al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of one Hundred Pounds a Year, and made him one of his Chaplains, from an <hi>antiquated</hi> Notion, that good Schoolmaſters ought to be encouraged in every Nation profeſſing Civility and Religion. Yet his Excellency did not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to make this bold Step without ſtrong Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations from Perſons of undoubted Principles <hi>fitted to the Times;</hi> who thought themſelves bound in Juſtice, Honour and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, to do the Doctor a good Office in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for the Care he had taken of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or thoſe of their Friends. Yet the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe was terrible; for the Doctor in the Height of his Felicity and Gratitude, going down to take Poſſeſſion of his Pariſh, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a few led Sermons, whereof, as it is to be ſuppoſed, the Number was very ſmall, having never ſerved a Cure in the Church; he ſtopp'd at <hi>Cork</hi> to attend on his Biſhop, and going to Church on the <hi>Sunday</hi> following, was, according to the uſual Civility of Country Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen, invited by the Miniſter of the Pariſh to ſupply the Pulpit. It happened to be the firſt of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> happened that Year to light upon a <hi>Sunday:</hi> And it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that the Doctor's Text was in theſe Words; <hi>Sufficient unto the Day is the Evil thereof.</hi> And laſtly, it happened, that ſome one Perſon of the Congregation, whoſe Loyalty
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1243900600:154"/>
made him watchful upon every Appearance of Danger to his Majeſty's Perſon and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when Service was over, gave the Alarm. Notice was immediately ſent up to Town, and by the Zeal of one Man, of no large Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of Body or Mind, ſuch a clamour was raiſed, that we in <hi>Dublin</hi> could apprehend no leſs than an Invaſion by the <hi>Pretender,</hi> who muſt be landed in the South. The Reſult was, that the Doctor muſt be ſtruck out of the Chaplains Liſt, and appear no more at the Caſtle. Yet, whether he were then, or be at this Day a <hi>Whig</hi> or a <hi>Tory,</hi> I think is a Secret; only it is manifeſt, that he is a zealous <hi>Hanoverian,</hi> at leaſt in Poetry, and a great Adorer of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Royal Family thro' all its Branches; his Friends likewiſe aſſert, that he had preached this ſame Sermon often, under the ſame Text; that not having obſerved the Words 'till he was in the Pulpit, and had opened his Notes, as he is a Perſon a little abſtracted, he wanted Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Mind to change them: And that in the whole Sermon there was not a Syllable relating to Government or Party, or to the Subject of the Day.</p>
            <p>In this Incident there ſeems to have been an Union of Events that will probably never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen again to the End of the World, or at leaſt, like the grand Conjunction in the Heavens, which, I think, they ſay can arrive but once in twenty Thouſand Years.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Gentleman (if I am right in my Chronology) who under the Suſpicion of a <hi>Tory</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:1243900600:155"/>
received ſome Favour from his Excellency, is Mr. <hi>James Stopford,</hi> very ſtrongly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the moſt eminent <hi>Whig</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> on the Account of his Learning and Virtue, and other Accompliſhments: He had paſs'd the greateſt Part of his Youth in cloſe Study, or in travelling; and was either not at Home or not at Leiſure to trouble his Thoughts about Party, which I allow to be a great Omiſſion; tho' I cannot honeſtly place him in the Liſt of <hi>Tories,</hi> and therefore think his Excellency may be fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquitted for making him Vicar of <hi>Finglaſs,</hi> worth about one Hundred and fifty Pounds a Year.</p>
            <p>The third is Doctor <hi>Patrick Delany;</hi> this Divine lies under ſome Diſadvantage, having in his Youth received many Civilities from a certain Perſon<note n="†" place="bottom">Sir <hi>Conſtantine Phipps,</hi> Lord Chancellor of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land when Queen <hi>Anne</hi> died.</note> then in a very high Station here, for which Reaſon I doubt the Doctor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>drunk his Confuſion</hi> ſince; and what makes the Matter deſperate, it is now too late; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs our Inquiſitors will be content with drinking <hi>Confuſion</hi> to his <hi>Memory.</hi> The aforeſaid emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Perſon who was a Judge of all Merit but <hi>Party,</hi> diſtinguiſhed the Doctor among other Juniors in our Univerſity, for his Learning, Virtue, Diſcretion, and good Senſe; but the Doctor was then in too good a Situation at his College to hope or endeavour at a better Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment from one who had no Power to give it him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:1243900600:156"/>
Upon the preſent Lord Lieutenant's coming over, the Doctor was named to his Exdellency by a Friend, among other Clergymen of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, as Perſons whoſe Characters it was proper his Excellency ſhould know: And by the Truth of which the Giver would be content to ſtand or fall in his Excellency's Opinion; ſince not one of thoſe Perſons were in particular Friendſhip with the Gentlemen who gave in their Names: By this and ſome other Incidents, particularly the Recommendation of the late Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Doctor became known to his Excellency, whoſe fatal Turn of Mind towards <hi>heatheniſh</hi> and <hi>outlandiſh</hi> Books and Languages, finding, as I conceive, a like Diſpoſition in the Doctor, was the Cauſe of his becoming ſo domeſtick as we are told he is, at the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three or four Years ago, the Doctor, grown weary of an Academick Life, for ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons beſt known to the Managers of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in that learned Society (which it may not be for their Honour to mention) reſolved to leave it, although by the Benefit of his Pupils, and his Senior-fellowſhip with all its Perquiſites, he received every Year between nine Hundred and a Thouſand Pounds. And a ſmall Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Living, in the Univerſity's Donation, of ſomewhat better than a hundred Pounds a Year, falling at the ſame Time with the Chancellor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> to about equal Value, in the Giſt of his Excellency, the Doctor ventured into the World in a very ſcanty Condition, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:1243900600:157"/>
ſquander'd away all his annual Income in a manner, which although perhaps proper enough for a Clergyman without a Family, will not be for the Advantage of his Character to diſcover either on the <hi>Exchange,</hi> or at a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's Shop.</p>
            <p>About two Months ago, his Excellency gave the Doctor a Prebend in St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral, which being of near the ſame Value with either of the two former will add a third Part to his Revenues, after he ſhall have paid the great Incumbrances upon it; ſo that he may now be ſaid to poſſeſs of Church Preſerments, in ſcattered Tythes, three hundred Pounds a Year, inſtead of the like Sum of infallible Rents from a ſenior Fellowſhip with the Offices annexed; beſides the Advantage of a free Lodging, and ſome other Eaſements. But ſince the Doctor hath not in any of his Writings, his Sermons, his Actions, his Diſcourſe, or his Company, diſcovered one ſingle Principle of either <hi>Whig</hi> or <hi>Tory;</hi> and that the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant ſtill continues to admit him, I ſhall bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounce him <hi>one of us;</hi> but like a new <hi>Free-Maſon,</hi> who hath not yet learned all the Dialect of the Myſtery. Neither can he juſtly be accuſed of any <hi>Tory</hi> Doctrines, except per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome among thoſe few, with which that <hi>wicked Party</hi> was charged during the Height of their Power, but have been ſince transferred for the moſt <hi>ſolid Reaſons</hi> to the <hi>whole Body</hi> of our firmeſt Friends. I have now done with the Clergy, and upon the ſtricteſt Examination,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:1243900600:158"/>
have not been able to find above one of that Order, againſt whom any <hi>Party</hi> Suſpicion can lie, which is the unfortunate Gentleman Dr. <hi>Sheridan,</hi> who by mere Chance-medly ſhot his own Fortune dead with a ſingle Text.</p>
            <p>As to the Laity, I can hear of but one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>Tory</hi> Stamp, who ſince the Beginning of his Excellency's Government, did ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any ſolid Mark of his Favour, I mean Sir <hi>Arthur Acheſon,</hi> reported to be an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <hi>Tory,</hi> and, what is almoſt as bad, a <hi>Scholar</hi> into the Bargain. It is whiſper'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout as a certain Truth, that this Gentleman is to have a Grant of a certain Barrack upon his Eſtate within two Miles of his own Houſe, for which the Crown is to be his Tenant, at the Rent of ſixty Pounds <hi>per Annum;</hi> he being only at the Expence of about <hi>five hundred</hi> Pounds, to put the Houſe in Repair, build Stables, and other Neceſſaries. I will place this <hi>invidious</hi> Mark of Beneficence, conferred on a <hi>Tory</hi> in a fair Light, by computing the Coſts and neceſſary Defalcations; after which it may be ſeen how much <hi>Sir Arthur</hi> will be annually a clear Gainer by the Publick, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his <hi>unfortunate</hi> Principles, and his Knowledge in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi>

            <p>It is true, there is another Advantage to be expected, which may fully compenſate the Loſs of Cattle and Poultry; by multiplying the Breed of Mankind; and particularly of <hi>good Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> in a Part of the Kingdom half depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the wild Humour among the Farmers thereof leaving their Country.

Value of the Favours done by his Excellency to the <hi>true Friends</hi> of their King and Country, and of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be remembered, that although his Excellency cannot be properly ſaid to beſtow Biſhopricks, Commands in the Army, the Place of a Judge, or Commiſſioner in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, and ſome others; yet they are, for the moſt Part, diſpoſed upon his Recommendation, except where the Perſons are immediately ſent from <hi>England</hi> by their Intereſt at Court, for which I have allowed large Defalcations in the following Accounts. And it is remarkable that the <hi>only</hi> conſiderable Station conferred on a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>Tory</hi> ſince his preſent Excellency's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was of this <hi>latter</hi> Kind.</p>
            <p>And indeed it is but too remarkable, that in a neighbouring Nation (where that dangerous Denomination of Men is incomparably more numerous, more powerful, and of Conſequence more formidable) <hi>real Tories</hi> can often with much leſs Difficulty obtain very high Favours from the Government, than their <hi>reputed</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren can arrive to the loweſt in ours.

            <head>AN ESSAY ON THE Fates of CLERGYMEN.</head>
            <p>THere is no <hi>Talent</hi> ſo uſeful towards riſing in the World, or which puts Men more out of the Reach of Fortune, than that Quality ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally poſſeſſed by the dulleſt Sort of People, and is in common Speech called <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> a Species of lower Prudence, by the Aſſiſtance of which, People of the meaneſt Intellectuals, without any other Qualification, paſs through the World in great Tranquility, and with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal good Treatment, neither giving nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Offence. <hi>Courts</hi> are ſeldom unprovided of Perſons under this Character, on whom, if they happen to be of great Quality, moſt Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, even the Greateſt naturally fall, when Competitors will not agree; and in ſuch Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, no Body rejoices or grieves. The Truth of this I could prove by ſeveral Inſtances, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my own Memory (for I ſay nothing of the preſent Times.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:1243900600:165"/>
And indeed, as Regularity and Forms are of great Uſe in carrying on the Buſineſs of the World, ſo it is very convenient, that Perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with this Kind of Diſcretion, ſhould have that Share which is proper to their Talents in the Conduct of Affairs, but by no means to meddle in Matters which require <hi>Genius, Learning, ſtrong Comprehenſion, Quickneſs of Conception, Magnanimity, Generoſity, Sagacity,</hi> or any other ſuperior Gift of human Minds. Becauſe this ſort of <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> is uſually attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſtrong Deſire of Money, and few Scruples about the Way of obtaining it, with ſervile Flattery and Submiſſion, with a Want of all publick Spirit or Principle, with a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wrong Judgment when the Owners come into Power and high Place, how to diſpoſe of Favour and Preferment; having no Meaſure for Merit and Virtue in others, but thoſe very Steps by which themſelves aſcended; nor the leaſt Intention of doing Good or Hurt to the Publick, farther than either one or t'other, is likely to be ſubſervient to their own Security or Intereſt. Thus being void of all Friendſhip and Enmity, they never complain nor find Fault with the Times, and indeed never have Reaſon to do ſo.</p>
            <p>Men of eminent Parts and Abilities, as well as Virtues, do ſometimes riſe in the <hi>Courts,</hi> ſometimes in the <hi>Law,</hi> and ſometimes, even in the <hi>Church.</hi> Such were the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and others in our own Times, whom I ſhall not name; but theſe, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:1243900600:166"/>
many more, under different Princes, and in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Kingdoms, were <hi>Diſgraced</hi> or <hi>Baniſhed</hi> or <hi>ſuffered Death,</hi> merely in Envy to their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and ſuperior <hi>Genius,</hi> which emboldened them in great Exigencies and Diſtreſſes of State (wanting a reaſonable Infuſion of this Aldermanly Diſcretion) to attempt the Service of their Prince and Country out of the common Forms.</p>
            <p>This evil Fortune, which generally attends extraordinary Men in the Management of great Affairs, hath been imputed to divers Cauſes, that need not be here ſet down, when ſo obvious an One occurs; if what a certain Writer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, be true, that <hi>when a great Genius appears in the World, the Dunces are all in Confederacy againſt him.</hi> And thus although he employs his <hi>Talents</hi> wholly in his Cloſet, without interfering with any Man's Ambition or Avarice; what muſt he expect when he ventures out to ſeek for Preferment in a Court, but univerſal Oppoſition when he is mounting the Ladder, and every Hand ready to turn him off, when he is at the Top? And in this Point Fortune generally acts directly contrary to Nature; for in Nature we find, that Bodies full of Life and Spirits mount eaſily, and are hard to fall, whereas heavy Bodies are hard to riſe, and come down with greater Velocity, in Proportion to their Weight; but we find Fortune every day acting juſt the Reverſe of this.</p>
            <p>This Talent of <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> as I have deſcribed it in its ſeveral Adjuncts and Circumſtances, is no where ſo ſerviceable as to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> to whoſe Preſerment nothing is ſo fatal as the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1243900600:167"/>
Character of Wit, Politeneſs in Reading, or Manners, or that Kind of Behaviour which we contract by having too much converſed with Perſons of high Stations and Eminency; theſe Qualifications being reckoned by the <hi>Vulgar</hi> of <hi>all Ranks,</hi> to be Marks of <hi>Levity,</hi> which is the laſt Crime the World will pardon in a <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman:</hi> To this I may add a free Manner of Speaking in mixt Company, and too frequent an Appearance in Places of much Reſort, which are equally noxious, to ſpiritual Promotions.</p>
            <p>I have known indeed a few Exceptions to ſome Parts of theſe Regulations. I have ſeen ſome of the dulleſt Men alive aiming at Wit, and others with as little Pretenſions affecting Politeneſs in Manners and Diſcourſe; but never being able to perſuade the World of their Guilt, they grew into conſiderable Stations, upon the firm Aſſurance which all People had of their <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> becauſe they were a Size too low to deceive the World to their own Diſadvantage. But this I confeſs is a Tryal too dangerous often to engage in.</p>
            <p>There is a known Story of a <hi>Clergyman,</hi> who was recommended for a Preferment by ſome great Men at Court, to an Archbiſhop. His Grace, ſaid he had heard that the <hi>Clergyman</hi> uſed to play at Whisk and Swobbers; that as to playing now and then a ſober Game at Whisk for Paſtime, it might be pardoned, but he could not digeſt thoſe wicked Swobbers, and it was with ſome Pains that my Lord <hi>S<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>rs</hi> could undeceive him. I ask, by what Talents we may ſuppoſe that great Prelate aſcend ſo
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1243900600:168"/>
high, or what ſort of Qualifications he would expect in thoſe whom he took into his Patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, or would probably recommend to Court for the Government of <hi>Diſtant Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two <hi>Clergymen</hi> in my Memory ſtood Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for a ſmall <hi>Free-School</hi> in <hi>

                  </gap>Shire,</hi> where a Gentleman of Quality and Intereſt in the Country, who happened to have a better Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding than his Neighbours, procured the Place for him who was the better Scholar, and more gentlemanly Perſon of the two, very much to the Regret of all the Pariſh; the other being diſappointed came up to <hi>London,</hi> where he became the greateſt Pattern of this lower <hi>Diſcretion</hi> that I have known, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with as heavy Intellectuals; which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Coldneſs of his Temper, and Gravity of his Deportment, carried him ſafe through many Difficulties, and he lived and died in a great Station, while his Competitor is too obſcure for Fame to tell us what become of him.</p>
            <p>This Species of <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> which I ſo much celebrate, and do moſt heartily recommend, hath one Advantage not yet mentioned, that it will carry a Man ſafe through all the Malice and Variety of Parties, ſo far, that whatever Faction happens to be uppermoſt, his Claim is uſually allowed for a Share of what is going. And the Thing ſeems to me highly reaſonable: For in all great Changes, the prevailing Side is uſually ſo tempeſtuous, that it wants the Ballaſt of thoſe, whom the World calls <hi>Moderate Men,</hi> and I call <hi>Men of Diſcretion,</hi> whom People in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1243900600:169"/>
Power may with little Ceremony load as heavy as they pleaſe, drive them through the hardeſt and deepeſt Roads without Danger of found'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or breaking their Backs, and will be ſure to find them neither ruſty nor vicious.</p>
            <p>I will here give the Reader a ſhort Hiſtory of two <hi>Clergymen</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> the Characters of each, and the Progreſs of their Fortunes in the World; by which the Force of worldly Diſcretion, and the bad Conſequences from the Want of that Virtue will ſtrongly appear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coruſodes,</hi> an <hi>Oxford</hi> Student, and a Farmer's Son, was never abſent from Prayers or Lecture, nor once out of his <hi>College</hi> after <hi>Tom</hi> had toll'd. He ſpent every Day ten Hours in his Cloſet, in reading his Courſes, Dozing, clipping Papers, or darning his Stockings, which laſt he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to Admiration. He could be ſoberly drunk at the Expence of others, with <hi>College</hi> Ale, and at thoſe Seaſons was always moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout. He wore the ſame Gown five Years, without dragling or tearing. He never once look'd into a Play-book or a Poem. He read <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ramus</hi> in the ſame Cadence, but with a very different Taſte. He never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood a Jeſt, or had the leaſt Conception of Wit.</p>
            <p>For one Saying he ſtands in Renown to this Day. Being with ſome other Students over a Pot of Ale, one of the Company ſaid ſo many pleaſant Things, that the reſt were much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, only <hi>Coruſodes</hi> was ſilent and unmoved. When they parted, he called this merry Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1243900600:170"/>
aſide, and ſaid, <hi>Sir, I preceive by your often ſpeaking, and our Friends Laughing, that you ſpoke many Jeſts, and you could not but obſerve my Silence. But, Sir, this is my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, I never make a Jeſt myſelf, nor ever laugh at another Man's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coruſodes</hi> thus endowed got into Holy Orders, having by the moſt extreme Parſimony ſaved thirty four Pounds out of a very beggarly Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, went up to <hi>London,</hi> where his Siſter was waiting Woman to a Lady, and ſo good a Sollicitor, that by her Means he was admitted to read Prayers in the Family twice a Day, at fourteen Shillings a Month. He had now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a low, obſequious, awkward Bow, and a Talent of groſs Flattery, both in and out of Seaſon; he would ſhake the Butler by the Hand; he taught the Page his <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> and was ſometimes admitted to dine at the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard's Table. In ſhort, he got the good Word of the whole Family, and was recommended by my Lady for Chaplain to ſome other Noble Houſe, by which his Revenue (beſide Vales) amounted to about thirty Pounds a Year; his Siſter procured him a Scarf from my Lord (who had a ſmall Deſign of Gallantry upon her;) and by his Lordſhip's Sollicitation he got a Lectureſhip in Town of ſixty Pounds a Year; where he preached conſtantly in Perſon, in a grave Manner, with an audible Voice, a Style Eccleſiaſtick, and the Matter (ſuch as it was) well ſuited to the Intellectuals of his Hearers. Some time after a Country Living fell in my Lord's Diſpoſal, and his Lordſhip, who had
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1243900600:171"/>
now ſome Encouragement given him of Succeſs in his Amour, beſtow'd the Living on <hi>Coru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodes,</hi> who ſtill kept his Lectureſhip and Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Town, where he was a conſtant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant at all Meetings relating to Charity, without ever contributing further than his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent pious Exhortations. If any Women of better Faſhion in the Pariſh happened to be abſent from Church, they were ſure of a Viſit from him in a Day or two, to chide and to dine with them.</p>
            <p>He had a ſelect Number of Poor, conſtantly attending at the Street Door of his Lodgings, for whom he was a common Sollicitor to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Patroneſs, dropping in his own Half-Crown among the Collections, and taking it out when he diſpoſed of the Money. At a Perſon of Quality's Houſe, he would never ſit down 'till he was thrice bid, and then upon the Corner of the moſt diſtant Chair. His whole Demeanor was formal and ſtarched, which adhered ſo cloſe, that he could never Shake it off in his higheſt Promotion.</p>
            <p>His Lord was now in high Employment at Court, and attended by him with the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Aſſiduity, and his Siſter being gone off with Child to a private Lodging, my Lord continued his Graces to <hi>Coruſodes,</hi> got him to be a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain in Ordinary, and in due Time a Pariſh in Town, and a <hi>Dignity in the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He paid his <hi>Curates</hi> punctually, at the loweſt Sallary, and partly out of the Communion-Money; but gave them good Advice in Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. He married a Citizen's Widow, who
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1243900600:172"/>
taught him to put out ſmall Sums at <hi>Ten per Cent.</hi> and brought him acquainted with Jobbers in <hi>Change-Alley.</hi> By her Dexterity, he ſold the Clarkſhip of his Pariſh, when it became vacant.</p>
            <p>He kept a miſerable Houſe, but the Blame was laid wholly upon <hi>Madam;</hi> for the good Doctor was always at his <hi>Books,</hi> or viſiting the Sick, or doing other Offices of Charity and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in his Pariſh.</p>
            <p>He treated all his Inferiors of the Clergy with a moſt ſanctified Pride; was rigorouſly and univerſally cenſorious upon all his Brethren of the Gown, on their firſt Appearance in the World, or while they continued meanly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred; but gave large Allowance to the Laiety of high Rank, or great Riches, uſing neither Eyes nor Ears for their Faults: He was never ſenſible of the leaſt Corruption in <hi>Courts, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> or <hi>Miniſtries,</hi> but made the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Conſtructions of all publick Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and Power, in whatever Hands, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Party, was always ſecure of his moſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Opinion. He had many wholeſome Maxims ready to excuſe all Miſcarriages of State; <hi>Men are but Men; Erunt vitia donee homines;</hi> and <hi>Quod ſupra nos, nil ad nos;</hi> with ſeveral others of equal Weight.</p>
            <p>It would lengthen my Paper beyond Meaſure to trace out the whole Syſtem of his Conduct; his dreadful Apprehenſions of <hi>Popery;</hi> his great Moderation towards Diſſenters of all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations; with hearty Wiſhes, that by yielding ſomewhat on both Sides, there might
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1243900600:173"/>
be a general Union among Proteſtants; his ſhort, inoffenſive Sermons in his Turns at Court, and the Matter exactly ſuited to the preſent Juncture of prevailing Opinions. The Arts he uſed to obtain a Mitre, by writing againſt Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, and the Proofs he gave of his Loyalty, by palliating or defending the Murder of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr'd Prince.</p>
            <p>Endowed with all theſe Accompliſhments, we leave him in the full Career of Succeſs, mounting faſt towards the Top of the Ladder Eccleſiaſtical, which he hath a fair Probability to reach, without the Merit of one ſingle Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, moderately ſtocked with the leaſt valuable Parts of Erudition, utterly devoid of all <hi>Taſte, Judgment,</hi> or <hi>Genius,</hi> and in his Grandeur na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally chuſing to hawl up others after him, whoſe Accompliſhments moſt reſemble his own, except his beloved Sons, Nephews, or other Kindred, be not in Competition; or laſtly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his Inclinations be diverted by thoſe who have Power to mortify or further advance him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenio</hi> ſet out from the ſame Univerſity, and about the ſame Time with <hi>Coruſodes;</hi> he had the Reputation of an arch Lad at School, and was unfortunately poſſeſſed with a <hi>Talent</hi> for <hi>Poetry,</hi> on which Account he received many chiding Letters from his Father, and grave Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from his Tutor. He did not neglect his College Learning, but his chief Study was the Authors of Antiquity, with a perfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Tongues.</hi> He could never procure himſelf to be choſen Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; for it was objected againſt him, that he 
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1243900600:174"/>
had written Verſes, and particularly ſome, wherein he glanced at a certain Reverend Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, famous for Dulneſs; That he had been ſeen bowing to Ladies as he met them in the Streets; and it was proved, that once he had been found dancing in a private Family with half a dozen of both Sexes.</p>
            <p>He was the younger Son to a Gentleman of a good Birth, but ſmall Fortune, and his Father dying, he was driven to <hi>London,</hi> to ſeek his Fortune: He got into Orders, and became Reader in a Pariſh-Church at twenty Pounds a Year, was carried by an <hi>Oxford</hi> Friend to <hi>Will</hi>'s <hi>Coffee-Houſe,</hi> frequented in thoſe Days by Men of Wit, where, in ſome Time, he had the bad Luck to be diſtinguiſhed. His ſcanty Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery compelled him to run deep in Debt for a new Gown and Caſſock, and now and then forced him to write ſome Paper of Wit or Humour, or preach a Sermon for ten Shillings, to ſupply his Neceſſities. He was a thouſand Times récom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by his Poetical Friends to great Perſons, as a young Man of excellent Parts, who deſerved Encouragement, and received a thouſand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; but his Modeſty, and a generous Spirit, which diſdained the Slavery of continual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and Attendance, always diſappointed him, making room for vigilant Dunces, who were ſure to be never out of Sight.</p>
            <p>He had an excellent Faculty in preaching, if he were not ſometimes a little too refined, and apt to truſt too much to his own Way of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reaſoning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:1243900600:175"/>
When upon the Vacancy of Preferment he was hardly drawn to attend upon ſome promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Lord, he received the uſual Anſwer, that he came too late, for it had been given to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the very Day before. And he had only this Comfort left, that every Body ſaid, it was a thouſand Pities, ſomething could not be done for poor Mr. <hi>Eugenio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Remainder of his Story will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in a few Words: Wearied with weak Hopes, and weaker Purſuits, he accepted a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy in <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> of thirty Pounds a Year, and when he was five and forty, had the great Felicity to be prefered by a Friend of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's, to a Vicaridge worth annually ſixty Pound, in the moſt deſert Parts of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> where, his Spirit quite ſunk with thoſe Reflections that Solitude and Diſappointments bring, he married a Farmer's Widow, and is ſtill alive, utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed and forgotten, only ſome of the Neighbours have accidentally heard, <hi>that he had been a notable Man in his Youth.</hi>

            <head>AN ESSAY ON <hi>Modern Education.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FROM frequently reflecting upon the Courſe and Method of educating Youth in this and a neighbouring Kingdom, with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Succeſs and Conſequence thereof, I am come to this Determination, That Education is always the <hi>worſe</hi> in Proportion to the <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Grandeur</hi> of the Parents; nor do I doubt in the leaſt, that if the whole World were now under the Dominion of <hi>one Monarch</hi> (provided I might be allowed to chuſe <hi>where</hi> he ſhould fix the Seat of his Empire) the only Son and Heir of that Monarch, would be the worſt edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Mortal, that ever was born ſince the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I doubt, the ſame Proportion will hold through all Degrees and Titles, from an Emperor downwards, to the common Gentry.</p>
            <p>I do not ſay, that this hath been always the Caſe; for in better Times it was directly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and a Scholar may fill half his <hi>Greek</hi> and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1243900600:177"/>
               <hi>Roman</hi> Shelves with Authors of the nobleſt Birth, as well as higheſt Virtue: Nor, do I tax all Nations at preſent with this Defect, for I know there are ſome to be excepted, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>Scotland,</hi> under all the Diſadvantages of its Climate and Soil, if that Happineſs be not rather owing even to thoſe very Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. What is then to be done, if this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection muſt fix on two Countries, which will be moſt ready to take Offence, and which of all others it will be leaſt prudent or ſafe to offend?</p>
            <p>But there is one Circumſtance yet more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and lamentable: For if, according to the <hi>Poſtulatum</hi> already laid down, the higheſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity any Youth is of, he is in greater Likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to be worſe educated; it behoves me to dread, and keep far from the Verge of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalum Magnatum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Retracting therefore that hazardous <hi>Poſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> I ſhall venture no further at preſent than to ſay, that perhaps ſome additional Care in educating the Sons of Nobility and principal Gentry, might not be ill employed. If this be not delivered with Softneſs enough, I muſt for the future be ſilent.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, let me ask only two Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, which relate to <hi>England.</hi> I ask firſt, how it comes about, that for above ſixty Years paſt, the chief Conduct of Affairs hath been generally placed in the Hands of <hi>New-men,</hi> with very few Exceptions? The Nobleſt Blood of <hi>England</hi> having been ſhed in the grand Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, many great Families became extinct, or ſupported only by Minors. When the King
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1243900600:178"/>
was reſtored, very few of thoſe Lords remained, who began, or at leaſt had improved their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, under the happy Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> or King <hi>Charles</hi> I. of which Lords the two principal were the Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Southampton.</hi> The Minors have, or had, during the Rebellion and Uſurpation, either received too much Tincture of bad Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples from thoſe fanatick Times, or coming to Age at the Reſtoration, fell into the Vices of that diſſolute Reign.</p>
            <p>I date from this Aera, the corrupt Method of Education among us, and the Conſequence thereof, in the Neceſſity the Crown lay under of introducing <hi>New-men</hi> into the chief Conduct of publick Affairs, or to the Office of what we now call Prime Miniſters, Men of Art, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Application and Inſinuation, merely for Want of a Supply among the Nobility. They were generally (though not always) of good Birth, ſometimes younger Brothers, at other Times ſuch, who, although inheriting good Eſtates, yet happened to be well educated, and provided with Learning; ſuch under that King, were <hi>Hyde, Bridgeman, Clifford, Osborn, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphin, Aſhley-Cooper:</hi> Few or none under the ſhort Reign of King <hi>James</hi> II. Under King <hi>William; Sommers, Mountague, Churchil, Vernon, Boyle,</hi> and many others: Under the Queen; <hi>Harley, St. John, Harcourt, Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,</hi> who indeed were Perſons of the beſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Families, but unadorn'd with Titles. So in the following Reign, Mr. <hi>Robert Walpole,</hi> was for many Years Prime Miniſter, in which
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1243900600:179"/>
Poſt he ſtill happily continues: His Brother <hi>Horace</hi> is Ambaſſador Extraordinary to <hi>France.</hi> Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Craggs,</hi> without the leaſt Allowance to ſupport them, have been Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of State.</p>
            <p>If the Facts have been thus for above ſixty Years paſt (whereof I could with a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Recollection produce many more Inſtances) I would ask again, how it hath happened, that in a Nation plentifully abounding with Nobility, ſo great Share in the moſt competent Parts of publick Management, hath been for ſo long a Period chiefly entruſted to Commoners, unleſs ſome Omiſſions or Defects of the higheſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, may be charged upon thoſe, to whom the Care of educating our Noble Youth had been committed? For, if there be any Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between human Creatures in the Point of natural Parts, as we uſually call them, it ſhould ſeem, that the Advantage lies on the Side of Children, born from noble and wealthy Parents; the ſame traditional Sloth and Luxury which render their Body weak and effeminate, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps refining and giving a freer Motion to the Spirits, beyond what can be expected from the groſs, robuſt Iſſue of meaner Mortals. Add to this, the peculiar Advantages, which all young Noblemen poſſeſs, by the Privileges of their Birth. Such as a free Acceſs to Courts, and a univerſal deference paid to their Perſons.</p>
            <p>But as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> chargeth it for a Fault on Princes, that they are impatient to compaſs <hi>Ends,</hi> without giving themſelves the Trouble of conſulting or executing the <hi>Means:</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:1243900600:180"/>
So, perhaps, it may be the Diſpoſition of young Nobles, either from the Indulgence of Parents, Tutors and Governors, or their own Inactivity, that they expect the <hi>Accompliſhments</hi> of a good Education, without the leaſt Expence of <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Study,</hi> to acquire them.</p>
            <p>What I ſaid laſt, I am ready to retract; for the Caſe is infinitely worſe; and the very Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims ſet up to direct modern Education, are enough to deſtroy all the Seeds of Knowledge, Honour, Wiſdom and Virtue among us. The current Opinion prevails, that the Study of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> is Loſs of Time; that publick Schools, by mingling the Sons of Noblemen with thoſe of the Vulgar, engage the former in bad Company; that Whipping breaks the Spirits of Lads well born; that Univerſities make young Men Pedants; that to dance, fence, ſpeak <hi>French,</hi> and know how to behave your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf among great Perſons of both Sexes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends <hi>the whole Duty of a Gentleman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot but think this wiſe Syſtem of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, hath been much cultivated among us by thoſe Worthies of the Army, who during the laſt War, returning from <hi>Flanders</hi> at the Cloſe of each Campaign, became the Dictators of Behaviour, Dreſs, and Politeneſs, to all thoſe Youngſters, who frequent Chocolate-Coffee-Gaming-Houſes, Drawing-Rooms, Opera's, Levees and Aſſemblies; where a Colonel by his Pay, Perquiſites and Plunder, was qualified to outſhine many Peers of the Realm; and by the Influence of an <hi>exotick</hi> Habit and Demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, added to other foreign Accompliſhments,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1243900600:181"/>
gave the Law to the whole Town, and was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed as the Standard-Pattern of whatever was refined in Dreſs, Equipage, Converſation, or Diverſions.</p>
            <p>I remember in thoſe Times, an admired Original of that Vocation, ſitting in a Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe near two Gentlemen, whereof one was of the Clergy, who were engaged in ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe that ſavoured of Learning; this Officer thought fit to interpoſe, and profeſſing to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Sentiments of his Fraternity, as well as his own (and probably did ſo of too many among them) turning to the Clergy-Man, ſpoke in the following Manner, <hi>D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>n me,</hi> &amp;c. After which he proceeded with a Volley of Military Terms, leſs ſignificant, ſounding worſe, and harder to be underſtood than any that were ever coined by the Commentators upon <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> I would not here be thought to charge the Soldiery with Ignorance and Contempt of Learning, without allowing Exceptions, of which I have known many; but however, the worſe Example, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a great Majority, will certainly prevail.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:1243900600:182"/>
I have heard, that the late Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the Time of his Miniſtry, never paſs'd by <hi>White</hi>'s <hi>Chocolate-Houſe</hi> (the common Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous of infamous Sharpers, and Noble Cullies) without beſtowing a Curſe upon that famous Academy, as the Bane of half the <hi>Engliſh No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi> I have likewiſe been told another Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage concerning that great Miniſter, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it gives a humorous Idea of one principal Ingredient in modern Education, take as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. <hi>Le Sack,</hi> the famous <hi>French</hi> Dancing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, in great Admiration, asked a Friend, whether it were true, that Mr. <hi>Harley</hi> was made an Earl and Lord Treaſurer? And finding it confirmed, ſaid; <hi>Well, I wonder what the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil the Queen could ſee in him; for I attended him two Years, and he was the greateſt Dunce that ever I taught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Hindrance to good Education, and I think the greateſt of any, is that pernicious Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in rich and noble Families, of entertaining <hi>French</hi> Tutors in their Houſes. Theſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Pedagogues</hi> are enjoyned by the Father, to take ſpecial Care that the Boy ſhall be perfect in his <hi>French;</hi> by the Mother, that <hi>Maſter</hi> muſt not walk 'till he is hot, nor be ſuffered to play with other Boys, nor be wet in his Feet, nor daub his Cloaths, and to ſee the Dancing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter attends conſtantly, and does his Duty; ſhe further inſiſts, that the Child be not kept too long poring on his Book, becauſe he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſore eyes, and of a weakly Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>By theſe Methods, the young Gentleman is in every Article as fully accompliſhed at eight
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1243900600:183"/>
Years old as at eight and twenty, Age adding only to the Growth of his Perſon and his Vice; ſo that if you ſhould look at him in his Boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood through the magnifying End of a Perſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and in his Manhood through the other, it would be impoſſible to ſpy any Difference; the ſame Airs, the ſame Strutt, the ſame Cock of his Hat, and Poſture of his Sword, (as far as the Change of Faſhions will allow) the ſame Underſtanding, the ſame Compaſs of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, with the very ſame Abſurdity, Impudence and Impertinence of Tongue.</p>
            <p>He is taught from the Nurſery, that he muſt inherit a great Eſtate, and hath no need to mind his Book, which is a Leſſon he never forgets to the End of his Life. His chief So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace is to ſteal down and play at Span-farthing with the Page, or young Black-a-moor, or little favourite Foot-Boy, one of which is his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Confident and Boſom-Friend.</p>
            <p>There is one young Lord in this Town, who, by an unexampled Piece of good Fortune, was miraculouſly ſnatched out of the Gulph of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, confined to a publick School for a due Term of Years, well whipped when he deſerved it, clad no better than his Comrades, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways their Play-Fellow on the ſame Foot, had no Precedence in the School, but what was given him by his Merit, and loſt it whenever he was negligent. It is well known how many Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies were bred at this unprecedented Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what Complaints among his <hi>Relations,</hi> and other <hi>Great Ones</hi> of both Sexes; that his Stockings with ſilver Clocks were raviſh'd from
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1243900600:184"/>
him; that he wore his own Hair; that his Dreſs was undiſtinguiſhed; that he was not fit to appear at a Ball or Aſſembly, nor ſuffered to go to either: And it was with the utmoſt Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, that he became qualified for his preſent Removal, where he may probably be farther perſecuted, and poſſibly with Succeſs, if the Firmneſs of a very worthy Governor, and his own good Diſpoſitions will not preſerve him. I confeſs, I cannot but wiſh he may go on in the Way he began, becauſe I have a Curioſity to know by ſo ſingular an Experiment, whether Truth, Honour, Juſtice, Temperance, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and good Senſe, acquired by a <hi>School</hi> and <hi>College</hi> Education, may not produce a very tolerable Lad, although he ſhould happen to fail in one or two of thoſe Accompliſhments, which in the general Vogue are held ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to the finiſhing of a Gentleman.</p>
            <p>It is true, I have known an Academical Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to have been exploded in publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies; and have heard more than one or two Perſons of high Rank declare, they could learn nothing more at <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> than to drink Ale and ſmoke Tobacco; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I firmly believed them, and could have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome hundred Examples from my own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in one of thoſe Univerſities; but they all were of young Heirs ſent thither, only for Form; either from Schools, where they were not ſuffered by their careful Parents to ſtay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three Months in the Year; or from under the Management of <hi>French</hi> Family-Tutors, who yet often attended them to their <hi>College,</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:1243900600:185"/>
to prevent all Poſſibility of their Improvement: But, I never yet knew any one Perſon of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who followed his Studies at the Univerſity, and carried away his juſt Proportion of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that was not ready upon all Occaſions to celebrate and defend that Courſe of Education, and to prove a Patron of learned Men.</p>
            <p>There is one Circumſtance in a learned Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which ought to have much Weight, even with thoſe who have no Learning at all. The Books read at <hi>School</hi> and <hi>Colleges,</hi> are full of Incitements to Virtue, and Diſcouragements from Vice, drawn from the wiſeſt Reaſons, the ſtrongeſt Motives, and the moſt influencing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. Thus, young Minds are filled early with an Inclination to Good, and an Abhorrence of Evil, both which encreaſe in them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Advances they make in Literature; and, although they may be, and too often are, drawn by the Temptations of Youth, and the Opportunities of a large Fortune, into ſome Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities, when they come forward into the great World, it is ever with Reluctance and Compunction of Mind, becauſe their Byaſs to Virtue ſtill continues. They may ſtray ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times out of Infirmity or Compliance, but they will ſoon return to the right Road, and keep it always in View. I ſpeak only of thoſe Exceſſes, which are too much the Attendants of Youth and warmer Blood; for, as to the Points of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Truth, Juſtice, and other noble Gifts of the Mind, wherein the Temperature of the Body hath no Concern, they are ſeldom or ever known to be mild.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:1243900600:186"/>
I have engaged my ſelf very unwarily in too copious a Subject for ſo ſhort a Paper. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Scope I would aim at is to prove, that ſome Proportion of human Knowledge appears re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to thoſe, who, by their Birth or Fortune, are called to the making of Laws, and in a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Way to the Execution of them; and that ſuch Knowledge is not to be obtained without a Miracle, under the frequent, corrupt, and ſottiſh Methods, of educating thoſe, who are born to Wealth or Titles. For, I would have it remembered, that I do by no Means confine theſe Remarks to young Perſons of Noble Birth; the ſame Errors running through all Families, where there is Wealth enough to afford, that their Sons (at leaſt the Eldeſt) may be good for nothing. Why ſhould my Son be a Scholar, when it is not intended that he ſhould live by his Learning? By this Rule, if what is commonly ſaid be true, that Money an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth all Things, why ſhould my Son be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, temperate, juſt, or charitable, ſince he hath no Intention to depend upon any of theſe Qualities for a Maintenance?</p>
            <p>When all is done, perhaps, upon the Whole, the Matter is not ſo bad as I would make it; and God, who worketh Good out of Evil, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only by the ordinary Cauſe and Rule of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, permits this continual Circulation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Things for his own unſearchable Ends. The Father grows rich by Avarice, Injuſtice, Oppreſſion; he is a Tyrant in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood over Slaves and Beggars, whom he calls his Tenants. Why ſhould he deſire to have
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1243900600:187"/>
Qualities infuſed into his Son, which himſelf never poſſeſſed, or knew, or found the Want of in the Acquiſition of his Wealth? The Son bred in Sloth and Idleneſs, becomes a Spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift, a Cully, a Profligate, and goes out of the World a Beggar, as his Father came in: Thus the former is puniſhed for his own Sins, as well as for thoſe of the latter. The Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill having raiſed a huge Muſhroom of ſhort Duration, is now ſpread to enrich other Mens Lands. It is indeed of worſe Conſequence, where noble Families are gone to Decay; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Titles and Privileges outlive their Eſtates: And, Politicians tell us, that nothing is more dangerous to the Publick, than a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nobility without Merit or Fortune. But even here, God hath likewiſe preſcribed ſome Remedy in the Order of Nature, ſo many great Families coming to an End by the Sloth, Luxury, and abandoned Luſts, which enervated their Breed through every Succeſſion, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing gradually a more effeminate Race, wholly unfit for Propagation.</p>

                  <head>A LETTER TO THE INTELLIGENCER.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IT may appear to you perhaps a Thing very unnatural to receive a Complaint from a <hi>Son</hi> againſt his <hi>Father;</hi> but the Treatment, which I meet with from mine, is of ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it is impoſſible for me not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</p>
                  <p>You muſt know there are three Brethren of us, <hi>George, Patrick,</hi> and <hi>Andrew;</hi> I am the ſecond, but the laſt in Affection with my <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> for which I call Heaven and Earth to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I never committed any Fault to incur his Diſpleaſure, or to deſerve his Neglect. But ſo it is, that the beſt of Men have often Times been miſled in the Choice of their Minions, and very undiſcerning in conferring their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours where they ought.</p>
                  <p>If Parents could but once bring themſelves to be impartial, it would, beyond all doubt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1243900600:189"/>
a delighful Union in their Children, and be the moſt binding Cement, that could be thought of, to preſerve their Affections; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an equal Diſpenſation of Favours would entirely remove all Cauſe of Murmuring, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining, or Envy; and, what is of the greateſt Conſequence, would ſecure the Love and Eſteem of their Children; whereas a partial Behaviour in Parents muſt neceſſarily produce the contrary.</p>
                  <p>But to ſtate my Caſe, in the beſt Manner I can, and with an unbiaſſed Regard to Truth, I think it firſt neceſſary to give you our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, with an Account of my <hi>Father</hi>'s Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, that you may be the better able to give me your <hi>Advice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt then, to begin with my Brother <hi>George.</hi> He was ever a great Lover of his Belly, and formerly uſed to cram himſelf with <hi>Beef, Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> and <hi>White-Pot;</hi> but for ſome Time paſt, he has taken more Delight in new fangled <hi>Toſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ups,</hi> and <hi>French Keck-Shaws.</hi> This high Feeding does naturally diſpoſe him to be haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſtubborn, cholerick and rebellious, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that beſides his Inſults towards others, he is ready upon all Occaſions to fly in his owm <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s Face, and apt to deſpiſe every Body but himſelf.</p>
                  <p>He is ſo various in his Opinions, that he is of as many <hi>Religions,</hi> as there are and have been <hi>Sects,</hi> ſince the Beginning of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> but the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Reformed Church as by Law eſtabliſhed,</hi> is what he chiefly frequents. He was once a great Admirer of ancient Learning, but he has long ſince quitted this, for the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1243900600:190"/>
Reading of <hi>News-Papers, Pamphlets,</hi> and <hi>Modern Languages.</hi> In his younger Years, he was fond of manly Exerciſes, ſuch as <hi>Fencing, Leaping, Boxing, pitching the Bar, Wreſtling, Hurling, Foot-ball, Hunting,</hi> &amp;c. but of late he has fallen into a ſtrange and unaccountable Effeminacy, and ſeems to take Delight in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Maſquerades, Plays,</hi> and <hi>Italian Opera</hi>'s. He is very fond of <hi>Italian</hi> magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Buildings, although entirely inconſiſtent with our Climate, extravagant in the higheſt Degree in purchaſing fine Paintings and Statues, and no leſs expenſive in vaſt extenſive Parks and Gardens, by which Means he has almoſt run out all his Fortune.</p>
                  <p>My younger Brother, <hi>Andrew,</hi> who has Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning enough to outwit the <hi>Devil,</hi> joined with Brother <hi>George</hi> ſome Years ago, and they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage ſo dextrouſly together, that whatever they ſay, is a <hi>Law</hi> with my <hi>Father;</hi> however, they are not without their Quarrels now and then; but Brother <hi>Andrew</hi> ſtill comes by the worſt, although he is cautious enough to go always armed, for Brother <hi>George</hi> wears a longer Sword. Brother <hi>Andrew</hi> is not very nice in his Food, but loves fine Cloaths. This I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he has learned abroad; for he is a great Traveller. His chief Studies are <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> and the <hi>Civil-Law,</hi> in both which he has made a conſiderable Progreſs. As for his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> although he openly profeſſes himſelf a moſt rigid <hi>Fanatick of the Kirk,</hi> yet he is ſhrewdly ſuſpected to have a Hankering after <hi>Popery.</hi> He has one eminent bad Quality,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1243900600:191"/>
which is, that he cannot eaſily forgive and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get. I remember I was once ſo unfortunate, as to tell a fair <hi>Lady,</hi> (a <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of mine) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Face, that I would ſtand by her againſt him and all her other Adverſaries, which he took heinouſly ill, and has not forgiven me to this Hour, but lies upon the Watch to do me all the ill Offices he can.</p>
                  <p>I come now to my own Character, in which I ſhall not conceal nor gloſs over my Vices, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, or Failings, but at the ſame Time, I ſhall not think it inconſiſtent with Modeſty, to tell you my Virtues.</p>
                  <p>I have but a ſmall Fortune, can hardly keep Soul and Body together, yet out of a Regard to my Family, which is very Ancient, I love to make what they call a Figure, upon extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Occaſions. And now and then I furniſh my Table with Victuals and Liquors of the beſt Kinds, which makes my <hi>Father</hi> and Brother <hi>George</hi> think I have got the World in a String. I am kind and hoſpitable to Strangers, although they frequently rob my Houſe, and turn my Children to lye in the Barn.</p>
                  <p>I am ſo fond of Learning, that I put them to the beſt School in the Kingdom, and I plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, they will be only the Wiſer, but never the Richer for it; becauſe my <hi>Father</hi> uſes all his Intereſt for Brother <hi>George</hi>'s Sons, and the greateſt <hi>Dunce</hi> among them ſhall be better provided for, than the moſt Ingenious of mine. And, I muſt ſay, I have ſome who are equal in Learning to the beſt of his. I had a Deſign once, to follow <hi>Merchandiſe,</hi> that I might the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1243900600:192"/>
better be able to provide for my poor Children; but Brother <hi>George</hi> having a Mind to make a <hi>Monopoly,</hi> prevailed upon my <hi>Father</hi> to join againſt me; and ſo at laſt they contrived it, that I ſhould ſell nothing but a few of my <hi>Cattle,</hi> and ſome <hi>Linnen-Cloth,</hi> which is all the Support I have; whereas Brother <hi>George</hi> can ſell every Thing he has, all the World over; and ſo cruel is he to me, that he will not let me have even a Bit of his Dirt, if he thinks it will be of any Advantage to me. My <hi>Religion</hi> is of three Sorts, the <hi>Eſtabliſhed, Popiſh,</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> but I have a greater Share of the firſt in me: I think it is beſt, becauſe it encourages Obedience to my <hi>Father,</hi> more than either of the other two. It is not long, ſince Brother <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> were in a Confederacy againſt my <hi>Father,</hi> with an Intent to turn him out of his Houſe, and give another the Poſſeſſion; at which critical Juncture, I muſtered up a great Number of my Sons and Servants, to his Aſſiſtance, and, for ought I know, ſaved both his Life and Fortune.</p>
                  <p>Soon after this, I had like to have been ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined by a Project; for one of my Brother <hi>George</hi>'s Family endeavoured to perſuade my <hi>Father,</hi> that <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> were of no Uſe to me, and deſired Leave to furniſh me with a few <hi>Counters,</hi> in Lieu thereof; and I fear, I ſhould have been ſo weak, as to accept of them, had it not been for the ſeaſonable Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances made by ſome of my own <hi>Houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are a few of the many Hardſhips I have ſuffered; notwithſtanding all which, I am
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1243900600:193"/>
willing to continue in <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> to my dear <hi>Father;</hi> for I have Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that his Unkindneſs to me, is owing to ill Adviſers, who have prejudiced him againſt me and my Children; but I hope before long he will be able to diſtinguiſh his moſt faithful Son. In the mean Time, I do humbly entreat the Favour of you to write a Letter to my <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> which he may ſee in Print, for I fear all my Letters to him hitherto have been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>

                  <p>YOU have not told me your <hi>Father</hi>'s Name, nor his Quality, and therefore I am at a Loſs in what Manner I ſhould addreſs him. But in common Humanity (becauſe I think your Caſe deplorable) I will give you what Comfort I am able, together with my beſt Advice.</p>
                  <p>You are not the only Inſtance of <hi>ſuffering Innocence,</hi> and therefore it ought not ſurprze you, that <hi>Providence</hi> (for Reaſons unaccountable to us) has laid two great Tryals in your Way, <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> from your <hi>Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> from your <hi>Father,</hi> this too without any Fault on your Side. If you did not meet with theſe Afflictions, you would want an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſhewing your Humility and Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I underſtand you do not by your Letter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:1243900600:194"/>
Let me adviſe you to conſider that your Condition is not quite ſo lamentable, as that of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who triumphed in GOD's own Time over all his Misfortunes and Sufferings, and at laſt had the Pleaſure of doing Good even to his Perſecutors; but indeed there is this Difference, that his Grievance was chiefly from his <hi>Brethren;</hi> for had his Father joined in the Cruelty, the Wounds would have pierced nearer to his Heart.</p>
                  <p>I do not in the leaſt doubt but there are ſome about your Father, who do you ill Offices, (I hope ſome Time or other they will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected:) You may find a convenient Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of getting fairly at him. State your Caſe and expoſtulate with him concerning your own and your Childrens Sufferings. When he hears your Story, and beholds your Sincerity, you may be ſure of his Compaſſion and a Redreſs; for there is no Heart ſo hard as not to ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with Real Woe, no Advocate ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as Innocence. In the mean Time, let me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you not to turn aſide to the Right or to the Left, from that indiſpenſable Duty, which the expreſs Laws of God enjoin you, for let me aſſure you that Ingratitude to a Parent is, no leſs than Rebellion, like the Sin of Witchcraft.</p>
                  <p>I commit you to his Care and Direction, who is beſt able to govern the unruly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Men, to turn the Hearts of the Malicious, and to relieve and ſupport thoſe who ſuffer for the Sake of Righteouſneſs.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>HAving lately, with great Candour and Impartiality, peruſed ſome of your <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> upon the Diſtreſs and Poverty of this <hi>Iſland,</hi> which you take Care to deſcribe in the moſt pathetick Manner, you muſt forgive me if I differ from you, and think it one of the moſt flouriſhing and wealthy Kingdoms in the whole World. And to ſupport my Opinion, I will venture to affirm, that there never was ſuch Affluence in ready Caſh as at this preſent Juncture: For have we not more <hi>Bankers</hi> than ever were known among us? And whether the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1243900600:196"/>
               <hi>Money</hi> circulates in <hi>Specie</hi> or <hi>Paper,</hi> it is the ſame Thing to us, ſince thoſe who would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have <hi>Caſh</hi> than <hi>Paper,</hi> can (as is well known) have their Choice, whenever they pleaſe. It is to be preſum'd that no <hi>Banker</hi> gives a NOTE before the <hi>Money</hi> is firſt laid down on his <hi>Counter;</hi> then of Conſequence there is as much <hi>Money</hi> as there is <hi>Paper;</hi> and that we have a great deal of <hi>Paper</hi> is moſt certain, therefore a great deal of <hi>Money.</hi> But I will proceed farther, and prove that we have much more <hi>Money</hi> than <hi>Paper,</hi> becauſe there are Multitudes who keep their own <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</hi> This appears from the great Number of <hi>Iron Cheſts</hi> imported from <hi>Holland</hi> within theſe laſt <hi>ſeven Years;</hi> for what Uſe can they be of, but to lodge <hi>Money?</hi> They are at leaſt two hundred. We will ſuppoſe that theſe, one with another, may contain <hi>two thouſand Pounds</hi> a piece, then the Sum total amounts to <hi>four hundred thouſand Pounds,</hi> which is ſo much ſuperfluous and unneceſſary <hi>Caſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this <hi>Iſland</hi> were not very wealthy, it is ſtrongly to be preſumed, that ſo many <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>able</hi> Heads, Men of great Learning and ſuperior Talents, whoſe Reputations reach'd us from diſtant Regions long before they came among us, ſo well diſtinguiſhed in their own <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> for their great Knowledge in their ſeveral Profeſſions, and here more eſpecially remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for their ſpeaking in publick, and their profound Skill in Religion, Politicks and Law: I ſay that Men of ſuch Accompliſhments would never quit their own Native Soil, where ſo
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1243900600:197"/>
many Eſtates are daily made, if they were not ſure that this <hi>Iſland</hi> muſt, on account of its greater Wealth, afford them Opportunities of making larger Acquiſitions than they could at home.</p>
            <p>Have not almoſt all the Gentlemen thro' this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> for ſome Years paſt, <hi>declined</hi> all <hi>profitable Employments,</hi> and left them to be filled by others? Can there be a ſtronger Argument of their Wealth, than their chuſing to live at their <hi>Eaſe, out of Office,</hi> rather than be at the ſmall Trouble which attends the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of a beneficial Employment?</p>
            <p>Could ſo many eſtated Gentlemen thro' the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> afford to keep ſo much of their <hi>Lands waſte</hi> and <hi>untenanted,</hi> if they had not <hi>Money</hi> enough by them to live without Tenants; and would not the Tenants likewiſe be glad to take this waſte Land to plow and ſow, but that they have ready Money enough to buy <hi>Bread Corn</hi> and other Neceſſaries from all the World beſide?</p>
            <p>As another ſignal Mark of our Riches, there is ſcarce a Gentleman who does not educate his Sons at our UNIVERSITY (<hi>which as the World ſees, wants not its due Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>) where they live at vaſt Expences, take Degrees, return to their Fathers, who, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever troubling <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Goſpel,</hi> maintain them afterwards at <hi>Home,</hi> like <hi>Gentlemen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do not many of our Nobility through Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs and Superfluity, reſide conſtantly in <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdom,</hi> where it is well known they make a better Figure, as to <hi>Houſes, Coaches,</hi>

and <hi>Equipages,</hi> than their Neighbours? And do not our young <hi>Peers,</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> who go thither <hi>to ſee the World, Game, Race, Drink,</hi> &amp;c. beyond any in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> of the ſame Age and Quality? Which they could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly do, if their Agents here had not an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drainable Fund to ſupply them.</hi> For as the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ſays, <hi>Nemo dat quod non habet:</hi> Or as the <hi>Juglar</hi> very elegantly expreſſes it, <hi>Where nothing is, there nothing can come out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be true, (I know it is confidently report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that a great Number of <hi>Engliſh Robbers</hi> are come over; that likewiſe is a very ſtrong Argument of our Wealth; for they would never quit the <hi>Engliſh Streets</hi> and <hi>Roads</hi> for ours, unleſs they were ſure to find an Advantage by the Change. It is moſt certain we never had ſuch a Number of <hi>Robbers</hi> as at this very Juncture; from whence we may conclude, that they could not poſſibly multiply thus, if they did not find Houſes and People enough to rob, for all Profeſſions and Trades encreaſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Encouragement they meet with.</p>
            <p>Are not whole Streets adding every Day to our <hi>Metropolis,</hi> when one would think it large enough already? Some entire Streets and many Houſes, I muſt confeſs, are waſte and uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited. But does not this ſhew the Wealth and Wantonneſs of the Inhabitants, who, not content with their preſent Dwellings, change them for others more coſtly and expenſive?</p>
            <p>Do not great Numbers of our Inhabitants, daily go off to <hi>America?</hi> will any Man ſay, this can be done with empty Pockets? Can any
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1243900600:199"/>
Man think otherwiſe, but that it muſt be the Effect of vaſt Superfluity, when People wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly take ſuch long Voyages, and Journeys, to go where they have no Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The laſt Argument I ſhall offer for the Wealth of this Kingdom, is the great Number of <hi>Beggars</hi> in which it abounds; for it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Obſervation, that Riches are the Parent of Idleneſs, Sloth, and Luxury; and are not theſe naturally productive of Want and Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary?</p>
            <p>I could offer many more Arguments, but that I hope you and your Countrymen are ſufficiently convinced, by what I have ſaid, that <hi>Ireland</hi> is a Place of great Wealth, Afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Plenty. Therefore let me adviſe you, the next Time you put Pen to Paper, not to dreſs up <hi>Hibernia</hi> in Rags and Dirt, but cloath her in <hi>Scarlet</hi> and <hi>fine Linnen;</hi> for ſhe can very well afford them. Draw the <hi>God</hi> of Riches, hovering over your <hi>Iſland,</hi> ſhaking ten Thouſand of Golden Feathers from his Wings, much more than the Inhabitants can gather. And thus will your Countrymen who have retrenched upon your laſt groundleſs Alarm, return to their former Hoſpitality, and we ſhall ſee <hi>Halcyon,</hi> that is <hi>Iriſh,</hi> Days once more.</p>

            <p>ON <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 13th of <hi>October,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> held his Lecture near the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> to an Audience of Fourteen wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Citizens, his Subſcribers and conſtant Hearers. Beſides theſe, there were five chance Auditors for that Night only, who had paid their Shillings a-peice.

            <p>Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> began by acquainting us, that (contrary to his Advertiſement) he thought himfelf in duty and conſcience, oblig'd to change the ſubject Matter of his intended diſcourſe.—Here he paus'd, and ſeem'd for a ſhort ſpace as it were loſt in Devotion and mental Prayer; after which, with great earneſtneſs and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence he ſpake as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Friends and Fellow Citizens, all ſpeculative Science is at an end; the Period of all things is at Hand; on <hi>Friday</hi> next this World ſhall be no more. Put not your confidence in me Brethren, for to morrow Morning five
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1243900600:202"/>
Minutes after five the Truth will be Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; in that inſtant the Comet ſhall appear, of which I have heretofore warn'd you. As ye have heard, believe. Go hence, and prepare your Wives, your Families and Friends, for the univerſal Change."</q>
            </p>
            <p>At this ſolemn and dreadful Prediction, the whole Society appear'd in the utmoſt Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but it would be unjuſt not to remember that Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> himſelf was in ſo calm a Temper, as to return a Shilling a piece to the Youths who had been diſappointed of their Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which I thought from a Man of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity a convincing Proof of his own Faith in the Prediction.</p>
            <p>As we thought it a Duty, in Charity to warn all Men; in two or three Hours the News had ſpread through the City. At firſt indeed, our report met with but little Credit, it being by our greateſt dealers in Stocks, thought only a Court-Artifice to ſink them, that ſome choice Favourites might purchaſe at a lower Rate; for the <hi>South Sea,</hi> that very Evening fell five <hi>per Cent.</hi> the <hi>India,</hi> eleven; and all the other Funds in Proportion. But at the Court-end of the Town, our Atteſtations were intirely disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd or turn'd into ridicule; yet nevertheleſs the News ſpread every where, and was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of all Converſation.</p>
            <p>That very Night, (as I was credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd) Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> was ſent for to a great Lady, who is very curious in the Learned Sciences, and addicted to all the Speculative Doubts of the moſt able Philoſophers; but he
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1243900600:203"/>
was not now to be found: and ſince at other times, he has been known not to decline that Honour, I make no doubt he conceal'd himſelf to attend the great Buſineſs of his Soul: But whether it was the Lady's Faith, or Inquiſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ocaſion'd her to ſend, is a Point I ſhall not preſume to determine. As for his being ſent for to the Secretary's Office by a Meſſenger, it is now known to be a Matter notoriouſly falſe, and indeed at firſt it had little credit with me, that ſo Zealous and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt a Man ſhould be <hi>ordered into Cuſtody,</hi> as a <hi>Seditious Preacher,</hi> who is known to be ſo well affected to the <hi>preſent happy Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas now I reflected with exceeding trouble and ſorrow, that I had diſus'd Family Prayers for above five Years, and (though it hath been a Cuſtom of late intirely neglected by Men of any Buſineſs or Station) I determin'd within myſelf no longer to omit ſo reaſonable and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious a Duty. I acquainted my Wife with my Intentions: But two or three Neighbours hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been engaged to Sup with us that Night, and many Hours being unwarily ſpent at Cards, I was prevail'd upon by her, to put it off till the next Day; ſhe reaſoning, that it would be time enough to take off the Servants from their Buſineſs (which this practice muſt infallibly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for an Hour or two every Day) after the <hi>Comet</hi> had made its appearance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zachary Bowen,</hi> a Quaker, and my next Neighbour, had no ſooner heard of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy but he made me a Viſit. I informed
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1243900600:204"/>
him of every thing I had heard, but found him quite obſtinate in his unbelieve; for, ſaid he, be comforted, Friend, thy tidings are Impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for were theſe things to happen, they muſt have been foreſeen by ſome of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. This indeed (as in all other ſpiritual Caſes with this Sett of People) was his only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt believing me; and, as he was fully perſuaded that the Prediction was erroneous, he in a very neighbourly Manner admoniſhed me againſt <hi>ſelling my Stock,</hi> at the preſent low Price; which, he ſaid, beyond diſpute muſt have a Riſe before <hi>Monday,</hi> when this unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Conſternation ſhould be over.</p>
            <p>But on WEDNESDAY Morning (I believe to the exact Calculation of Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi>) the <hi>Comet</hi> appear'd: For at three Minutes aster five by my own Watch, I ſaw it. He indeed, foretold that it would be ſeen at five Minutes after Five, but as the beſt Watches may be a Minute or two too ſlow, I am apt to think his Calculation juſt to a Minute.</p>
            <p>In leſs than a quarter of an Hour, all <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide</hi> was crouded with a vaſt concourſe of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and notwithſtanding it was ſo early, 'tis thought that through all that part of the Town, there was not Man, Woman or Child, except the Sick, or Infirm, left in their Beds. From my own Balcony, I am conſident, I ſaw ſeveral Thouſands in the Street, and counted at leaſt ſeventeen who were upon their Knees, and ſeem'd in actual Devotion. Eleven of them indeed appear'd to be old Women of about Fourſcore; The Six others, were Men in an
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1243900600:205"/>
advanc'd Life, but (as I could gueſs) two of them might be under Seventy.</p>
            <p>It is highly probable, that an event of this Nature, may be paſs'd over by the greater Hiſtorians of our Times, as conducing very little or nothing to the unravelling and laying open the deep Schemes of Politicians and Myſteries of State; for which reaſon, I thought it might not be unacceptable to record the Facts, which in the Space of three Days came to my Knowledge, either as an Eye-witneſs, or from unqueſtionable Authorities; nor can I think this Narrative will be intirely without its Uſe, as it may enable us to form a more juſt Idea of our Countrymen in general, particularly in regard to their Faith, Religion, Morals and Politicks.</p>
            <p>Before WEDNESDAY Noon, the Belief was univerſal that the Day of Judgment was at Hand, inſomuch, that a Waterman of my accquaintance told me he counted no leſs than one hundred and twenty three Clergymen, who had been ferry'd over to <hi>Lambeth</hi> before twelve a-Clock: theſe, 'tis ſaid, went thither, to Petition, that a <hi>ſhort Prayer</hi> might be <hi>Penn'd</hi> and <hi>Order'd,</hi> there being none in the Service upon that occaſion. But as in things of this Nature, it is neceſſary that the <hi>Council</hi> be conſulted, their requeſt was not immediately comply'd with; and this I affirm to be the true and only Reaſon that the Churches were not that Morning ſo well attended; and is in no ways to be imputed to the Fears and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation of the Clergy, with which the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkers
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1243900600:206"/>
have ſince very unjuſtly reproach'd them.</p>
            <p>My Wife and I went to Church (where we had not been for many Years on a Week-day) and, with a very large Congregation, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of the Service. But (what will be ſcarce credible) by the careleſſneſs of a 'Prentice, in our abſence, we had a Piece of fine <hi>Cambric</hi> carried off by a Shop-lifter, ſo little impreſſion was yet made on the minds of thoſe wicked Women!</p>
            <p>I cannot omit the care of a particular <hi>Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Bank;</hi> I hope the worthy and wealthy Knight will forgive me that I endeavour to do him Juſtice; for it was unqueſtionably owing to Sir <hi>G<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>'s ſagacity that all the <hi>Fire-Offices</hi> were requir'd to have a particular Eye upon the <hi>Bank of England.</hi> Let it be recorded to his Praiſe that in the general hurry, this ſtruck him as his neareſt and tendereſt concern; but the next day in the Evening, after having taken due care of all his Books, Bills and Bonds, I was inform'd, his mind was wholly turn'd upon Spiritual Matters; yet, ever and anon, he could not help expreſſing his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the <hi>Tories</hi> and <hi>Jacobites,</hi> to whom he imputed that ſudden <hi>Run upon the Bank</hi> which happen'd on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>A Great Man (whom at this time it may not be prudent to name) employ'd all the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Morning, to make up ſuch an Account as might appear fair, in caſe he ſhould be call'd upon to produce it on the <hi>Friday;</hi> but was forced to deſiſt, after having
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1243900600:207"/>
for ſeveral Hours together attempted it, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to bring himſelf to a reſolution to truſt the many hundred Articles of his ſecret Tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon Paper.</p>
            <p>Another ſeem'd to be very melancholy, which his flatterers imputed to his dread of loſing his Power in a Day or two; but I rather take it, that his chief concern was, the Terror of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing try'd in a Court that could not be influenc'd and where a Majority of Voices could avail him nothing. It was obſerv'd too, that he had few Viſitors that Day; this added ſo much to his Mortification, that he read thro' the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> and wept over it bitterly; in ſhort, he ſeem'd a true Penitent in every thing but in Charity to his Neighbour. No buſineſs was that Day done in his <hi>Compting-Houſe;</hi> 'tis ſaid too, that he was advis'd to Reſtitution, but I never heard that he comply'd with it any farther than in giving half a Crown a piece to ſeveral craz'd, and ſtarving Creditors, who attended in the outward Room.</p>
            <p>Three of the <hi>Maids of Honour</hi> ſent to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand their Birth-day Cloaths; two of them burnt all their Collections of Novels and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, and ſent to a Bookſeller's <hi>in Pall-mall</hi> to buy each of them a Bible, and <hi>Taylor</hi>'s <hi>Holy Living and Dying.</hi> But I muſt do all of them the Juſtice to acknowledge, that they ſhew'd a very decent Behaviour in the drawing Room, and reſtrain'd themſelves from thoſe innocent Freedoms and little Levities ſo commonly inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to young Ladies of their Profeſſion. So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Birth-day Suits were countermanded the next
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1243900600:208"/>
Day, that moſt of the Taylors and Mantua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers diſcharg'd all their Journeymen and Women. A grave elderly Lady of great Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Modeſty who viſits theſe young Ladies, ſeem'd to be extreamly ſhock'd, by the Apprehenſions that She was to appear naked before the whole World; and no leſs ſo, that all Mankind was to appear naked before Her; which might ſo much divert her Thoughts, as to incapacitate her to give Ready and apt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the Interrogatories that might be made her. The Maids of Honour who had both Modeſty and Curioſity, could not imagine the Sight ſo diſagreeable as was repreſented; nay, one of them went ſo far as to ſay, ſhe perfectly long'd to ſee it; for it could not be ſo indecent, when every body was to be alike; and they had a Day or two to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to be ſeen in that condition. Upon this reflection, each of them order'd a Bathing-Tub to be got ready that Evening, and a Looking-Glaſs to be ſet by it. So much are theſe young Ladies both by Nature and Cuſtom addicted to cleanly appearance.</p>
            <p>A Weſt-Country Gentleman told me, he got a Church-Leaſe fill'd up that Morning for the ſame Sum which had been refus'd for three Years ſucceſſively. I muſt impute this meerly to accident; for I cannot imagine that any Divine could take the advantage of his Tenant, in ſo unhandſome a Manner; or that the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Life was in the leaſt his Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; though I have heard the ſame worthy
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1243900600:209"/>
Prelate aſpers'd and malign'd ſince upon this very Account.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Term</hi> being ſo near, the alarm among the LAWYERS was inexpreſſible, though ſome of them, I was told, were ſo vain as to promiſe themſelves ſome advantages in making their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, by being vers'd in the Practice of our earthly Courts. It is ſaid too, that ſome of the chief Pleaders were heard to expreſs great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that there had been but ſew <hi>State-Tryals</hi> of late Years. Several Attornies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>return of Fees</hi> that had been given the Lawyers: but it was anſwered the Fee was undoubtedly charg'd to their Client, and that they could not connive at ſuch Injuſtice, as to ſuffer it to be ſunk in the Attorney's Pockets. Our ſage and learned <hi>Judges</hi> had great conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſomuch as they had not pleaded at the Bar for ſeveral Years; the <hi>Barriſters</hi> rejoyced in that they were not <hi>Attornies,</hi> and the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies felt no leſs ſatisfaction that they were not <hi>Petti-foggers, Scriveners,</hi> and other meaner Officers of the Law.</p>
            <p>As to the ARMY, far be it from me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the Truth. Every Soldier's behaviour was as undiſmayed, and undaunted, as if nothing was to happen: I impute not this to their want of Faith, but to their martial Diſpoſition; though I cannot help thinking they commonly accompany their commands with more <hi>Oaths</hi> than are requiſite, of which there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable diminution this Morning on the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park. But poſſibly it was by choice, and on conſideration, that they
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:1243900600:210"/>
continued this way of Expreſſion, not to intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the common Soldiers, or give occaſion to ſuſpect that even the Fear of Damnation could make any impreſſion upon their Superior Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. A <hi>Duel</hi> was fought the ſame Morning between two Colonels, not occaſion'd, (as was reported) becauſe the one was put over the other's Head; that being a Point which might at ſuch a Juncture have been accommodated by the Mediation of Friends; but as this was upon the account of a Lady, 'twas judg'd it could not be put off at this time, above all others, but demanded immediate Satisfaction. I am apt to believe that a young Officer who deſir'd his Surgeon to defer putting him into a Salivation till <hi>Saturday,</hi> might make this requeſt out of ſome Opinion he had of the truth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; for the apprehenſions of any danger in the Operation could not be his Motive, the Surgeon himſelf having aſſured me that he had before undergone three ſevere Operations of the like Nature, with great reſignation and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p>There was an Order iſſued, that the <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains</hi> of the ſeveral <hi>Regiments</hi> ſhould attend their Duty; but as they were diſpers'd about in ſeveral parts of <hi>England,</hi> it was believ'd, that moſt of them could not be found, or ſo much as heard of, till the great Day was over.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the conſiderable PHYSICIANS by their outward demeanor ſeem'd to be Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; but at the ſame time, they every where inſinuated, that there might be a <hi>Peſtilential Malignancy</hi> in the <hi>Air,</hi> occaſion'd by the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:1243900600:211"/>
which might be arm'd againſt by proper and timely Medicines. This caution had but little effect; for as the time approach'd, the Chriſtian Reſignation of the People encreas'd, and moſt of them (which was never before known) had their Souls more at Heart, than their Bodies.</p>
            <p>If the Reverend CLERGY ſhow'd more Concern than others, I charitably impute it to their great <hi>charge of Souls;</hi> and what confirm'd me in this Opinion was, that the <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> and <hi>Terror</hi> could be diſtinguiſh'd to be greater or leſs, according to their <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like might be obſerv'd in all ſorts of Miniſters, though not of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> the higher their Rank, the more was their Fear.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak not of the COURT, for fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and I forbear Inſerting the <hi>Names</hi> of particular Perſons, to avoid the imputation of Slander, ſo that the Reader will allow this Narrative muſt be deficient, and is therefore deſir'd to accept hereof rather as a Sketch, than a regular circumſtantial Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>I was not inform'd of any Perſons who ſhew'd the leaſt Joy, except three Malefactors who were to be executed the <hi>Monday</hi> following, and one Old Man, a conſtant Church-goer, who being at the point of Death, expreſt ſome ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction at the News.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> Morning there was little or nothing tranſacted in <hi>Change-Alley;</hi> there were a Multitude of Sellers, but ſo few Buyers,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:1243900600:212"/>
that one cannot affirm the Stocks bore any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Price except among the <hi>Jews;</hi> who this Day, reap'd great Profit by their Infidelity. There were many who call'd themſelves <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> who offer'd to buy <hi>for time,</hi> but as theſe were People of <hi>great Diſtinction,</hi> I chuſe not to mention them, becauſe in effect it would ſeem to accuſe them both of Avarice, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Run</hi> upon the <hi>Bank</hi> is too well known to need a particular Relation; for it never can be forgotten that no one Perſon whatever (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Directors</hi> themſelves, and ſome of their particular Friends and Aſſociates) could convert a <hi>Bill</hi> all that Day into <hi>Specie;</hi> all hands being imploy'd to ſerve <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſeveral Churches of the City and Suburbs, there were ſeven Thouſand two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Forty Five, who publickly and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly declar'd before the Congregation, that they took to Wife their ſeveral <hi>kept Miſtreſſes,</hi> which was allow'd as valid Marriage, the Prieſts not having time to pronounce the Ceremony in Form.</p>
            <p>At St. <hi>Bride</hi>'s Church in <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Woolſton</hi> (who writ againſt the Miracles of our Saviour) in the utmoſt Terrors of Conſcience, made a publick Recantation. Dr. <hi>Mandevil;</hi> (who had been groundleſsly reported formerly to have done the ſame) did it now in good earneſt at St. <hi>James</hi>'s Gate; as did alſo at the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> Church ſeveral Gentlemen, who frequent <hi>Coffee-Houſes</hi> near the Bar. So great was the Faith and Fear of two of them, that they
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:1243900600:213"/>
dropt Dead on the Spot; but I will not record their Names, leſt I ſhould be thought invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to lay an Odium on their Families and Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the <hi>Players</hi> who had very little Faith before, were now deſirous of having as much as they cou'd, and therefore embrac'd the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion;</hi> the ſame thing was obſerv'd of ſome <hi>Bawds,</hi> and <hi>Ladies of Pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentleman out of pure Friendſhip came to make me a Viſit, and advis'd me to <hi>hire a Boat</hi> for the enſuing Day, and told me, that unleſs I gave earneſt for one immediately, he fear'd it might be too late; for his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had ſecured almoſt every Boat upon the River, as judging that, in the <hi>general Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to be upon the <hi>Water</hi> would be the <hi>ſafeſt Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were <hi>two Lords,</hi> and <hi>three Commoners,</hi> who, out of a ſcruple of Conſcience, very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily threw up their Penſions, as imagining a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was only an annual <hi>retaining Bribe.</hi> All the other great Penſioners, I was told, had their Scruples quieted by a <hi>Clergyman</hi> or two of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whom they happily conſulted.</p>
            <p>It was remarkable that ſeveral of our very richeſt <hi>Tradeſmen</hi> of the City, in common Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, gave away Shillings and Six-pences to the Beggars, who ply'd about the Church Doors; and at a particular Church in the City, a Weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Church-warden</hi> with his own Hands diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted Fifty twelve-penny Loaves to the Poor by way of Reſtitution for the many great and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:1243900600:214"/>
coſtly Feaſts, which he had eaten of at their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
            <p>Three great Ladies, a <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> two Lords, a Cuſtom-Houſe Officer, five Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay Captains, and a Baronet, (all noted <hi>Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>) came publickly into a Church at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and depoſited a very conſiderable Sum of Money in the Miniſter's Hands; the Parties whom they had defrauded, being either out of Town, or not to be found. But ſo great is the Hardneſs of Heart of this Fraternity, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong either the Noble, or Vulgar Gameſters, (though the Profeſſion is ſo general) I did not hear of any other reſtitution of this Sort. At the ſame time I muſt obſerve that (in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of theſe) through all parts of the Town, the Juſtice and Penitence of the <hi>Highway-Men, Houſe-breakers,</hi> and common <hi>Pick-Pockets</hi> was very remarkable.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Directors</hi> of our <hi>Publick Companies</hi> were in ſuch dreadful apprehenſions, that one would have thought a <hi>Parliamentary Enquiry</hi> was at hand; yet ſo great was their preſence of Mind, that all the <hi>Thurſday</hi> Morning was taken up in <hi>private Transfers,</hi> which by malicious People was thought to be done with deſign to conceal their Effects.</p>
            <p>I forbear mentioning the private Confeſſions of particular <hi>Ladies</hi> to their <hi>Husbands;</hi> for as their Children were born in Wedlock, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence are Legitimate, it would be an invidious Task to record them as Baſtards; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly after their ſeveral Husbands have ſo chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably forgiven them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:1243900600:215"/>
The Evening and Night, through the whole Town, were ſpent in Devotions both Publick and Private; the Churches for this one Day, were ſo crowded by the Nobility and Gentry, that Thouſands of common People were ſeen praying in the publick Streets. In ſhort, one would have thought the whole Town had been really and ſeriouſly religious. But what was very remarkable, all the different Perſuaſions kept by themſelves, for as each thought the other would be damned, not one would join in Prayer with the other.</p>
            <p>At length FRIDAY came, and the People cover'd all the Streets; Expecting, Watching and Praying. But as the Day wore away, their Fears firſt began to abate, then leſſen'd every hour, at Night they were almoſt extinct, till the total Darkneſs, that hitherto us'd to terrify, now comforted every <hi>Free-thinker</hi> and <hi>Atheiſt.</hi> Great numbers went together to the <hi>Taverns,</hi> beſpoke <hi>Suppers,</hi> and broke up whole <hi>Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads</hi> for joy. The ſubject of all Wit and Converſation was to ridicule the Prophecy, and railly each other. All the Quality and Gentry were <hi>perfectly aſham'd,</hi> nay, ſome utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own'd that they had manifeſted any Signs of Religion.</p>
            <p>But the next Day, even the Common People, as well as their Betters, appear'd in their uſual ſtate of Indifference. They Drank, they Whor'd, they Swore, they Ly'd, they Cheated, they Plunder'd, they Gam'd, they Quarrell'd, they Murder'd. In ſhort, the World went on in the old Channel.</p>
            <p>

I need not give any Inſtances of what will ſo eaſily be credited, but I cannot omit relating, that Mr. <hi>Woolſton</hi> advertis'd, in that very <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>'s <hi>Evening-Poſt,</hi> a new <hi>Treatiſe</hi> againſt the <hi>Miracles</hi> of our Saviour; and that the few, who had given up their Penſions the Day before, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to have them continued; which, as they had not been thrown up upon any Miniſterial Point, I am inform'd was readily granted.</p>

               <l>WELL; if ever I ſaw ſuch another Man ſince my Mother bound my Head,</l>
               <l>You a Gentleman! marry come up, I wonder where you were bred?</l>
               <l>I am ſure ſuch Words does not become a Man of your Cloth,</l>
               <l>I would not give ſuch Language to a Dog, faith and troth.</l>
               <l>Yes; you call'd my Maſter a Knave: Fie Mr. <hi>Sheridan,</hi> 'tis a Shame</l>
               <l>For a Parſon, who ſhou'd know better Things, to come out with ſuch a Name.</l>
               <l>Knave in your Teeth, Mr. <hi>Sheridan,</hi> 'tis both a Shame and a Sin,</l>
               <l>And the Dean my Maſter is an honeſter Man than you and all your kin:</l>
               <l>He has more goodneſs in his little Finger, than you have in your whole Body,</l>
               <l>My Maſter is a parſonable Man, and not a ſpindle-ſhank'd hoddy doddy.</l>

                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:1243900600:241"/>
And now whereby I find you would fain make an excuſe,</l>
               <l>Becauſe my Maſter one Day in anger call'd you Gooſe.</l>
               <l>Which, and I am ſure I have been his Servant four Years ſince <hi>October,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And he never call'd me worſe than Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart drunk or ſober:</l>
               <l>Not that I know his Reverence was ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to my knowledge,</l>
               <l>Tho' you and your Come-rogues keep him out ſo late in your Colledge.</l>
               <l>You ſay you will eat Graſs on his Grave: a Chriſtian eat Graſs!</l>
               <l>Whereby you now confeſs your ſelf to be a Gooſe or on Aſs:</l>
               <l>But that's as much as to ſay, that my Maſter ſhould die before ye,</l>
               <l>Well, well, that's as God pleaſes, and I don't believe that's a true Story,</l>
               <l>And ſo ſay I told you ſo, and you may go tell my Maſter; what care I?</l>
               <l>And I don't care who knows it, 'tis all one to <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Every body knows, that I love to tell Truth and ſhame the Devil,</l>
               <l>I am but a poor Servant, but I think Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks ſhould be civil.</l>

Beſides, you found fault with our Vittles one Day that you was here,</l>
               <l>I remember it was on a <hi>Tueſday,</hi> of all Days in the Year.</l>
               <l>And <hi>Saunders</hi> the Man ſays, you are always jeſting and mocking,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Mary</hi> ſaid he (one Day, as I was mending my Maſter's Stocking,)</l>
               <l>My Maſter is ſo fond of that Miniſter that keeps the School;</l>
               <l>I thought my Maſter a wiſe Man, but that Man makes him a Fool.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Saunders</hi> ſaid I, I would rather than a Quart of Ale,</l>
               <l>He would come into our Kitchen, and I would pin a Diſh-clout to his Tail.</l>
               <l>And now I muſt go, and get <hi>Saunders</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect this Letter,</l>
               <l>For I write but a ſad Scrawl, but my Siſter <hi>Marget</hi> ſhe writes better.</l>
               <l>Well, but I muſt run and make the Bed before my Maſter comes from Pray'rs,</l>
               <l>And ſee now, it ſtrikes ten, and I hear him coming up Stairs:</l>
               <l>Whereof I cou'd ſay more to your Verſes, if I cou'd write written hand,</l>
               <l>And ſo I remain in a civil way, your Servant to command</l>
