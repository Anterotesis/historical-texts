         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Each little ſtar, faint glitt'ring, caſt a ray,</l>
               <l>And ſpangled o'er the duſky robe of night.</l>

               <l>Fond of the ſcene, I wander'd far from home,</l>

               <l>The bat had been an hour on the wing,</l>

               <l>Thro' the wide breaches of the rock-built walls</l>
               <l>Pale Cynthia beam'd her lucid columns down</l>

               <l>A deep-felt ſigh from out the ruins came,</l>
               <l>As from a heart juſt burſting with its load,</l>

               <l>On the low baſis of a mould'ring urn</l>

               <l>A lovely boy, the offspring of their loves.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The wretched huſband on her neck reclin'd,</l>
               <l>Striving to chear his melancholy dame,</l>
               <l>Feigned a hope, tho' foreign to his heart:</l>
               <l>But when he found deſpair had ſeiz'd her ſoul,</l>
               <l>His tears burſt forth, and bath d his manly cheeks,</l>
               <l>And on his bended knees he trembling fell,</l>
               <l>Lifting his eyes with anguiſh 'gainſt the ſky,</l>
               <l>With invocations loud, and agonizing ſighs,</l>
               <l>Imploring heaven for a ray of peace,</l>
               <l>Till his loud accents ſhook the vaulted roof,</l>
               <l>And reft his tortur'd breaſt.—I cou'd no more,</l>
               <l>But flying to his aid with heart diſtreſs'd,</l>

He fix'd his eyes with furious glare upon me,</l>
               <l>And threaten'd me with death if I advanc'd;</l>
               <l>Like the fierce tyger, aſſail'd by hunters</l>
               <l>In his dreary den, he ſtood defenſive o'er his young,</l>
               <l>Shielding 'em from danger. With humble voice</l>
               <l>And friendly tears I mov'd him to attend,</l>
               <l>And liſten patient to the voice of pity.</l>
               <l>Joy then, with fear and admiration mix'd,</l>
               <l>O'erſpread each face, and as I ſpake, they bleſt;</l>
               <l>Hope, like the ſun that clouds had long o'erveil'd,</l>

Seeing others ſo, by me made happy.</l>

               <l>Mocking adverſity, in hollow ſounds,—</l>
