            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </lg>

               <l>With its moiſture refreſhes the ground,</l>
               <l>And the drops, as they hang on the plants and the flowers,</l>
               <l>Like rich gems beam a luſtre around:</l>
            </lg>

               <l>And the cuckow proclaims with his voice,</l>
               <l>That nature marks this for the ſeaſon to wooe,</l>
               <l>And for all that can love to rejoice:</l>

               <l>And trace the muſes to their fountain head?</l>

               <l>Ye ſacred nine, your mighty aid impart,</l>

               <l>Where nature warmth and genius has denied,</l>
               <l>In vain are art's ſtiff languid powers applied.</l>
               <l>Unforc'd the muſes ſmile, above controul:</l>

               <l>And each low period indolently chime.</l>
               <l>A common ear perhaps, or vulgar heart,</l>

            <l>Pomp, free from flattery, and from ſcorn,</l>
            <l>And love's ſweet flower, without the thorn.</l>

                  <p>Cupid opens his deſign of making the Kite, and offers his arms to Dian. The Loves deſcend. The plan for the Kite is laid out by a mechanical Love, who begs Cupid's bow of Dian. They all aſſiſt in the work, till the leaves of the copy-book are uſed. Here Mercury ſeaſonably fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes them with acts of parliament. The tail is finiſh'd, and the lanthorn added by Dian. Cupid receives it, and inſtitutes the game of leaping over the candle. A ſhort epiſode on this ſubject.</p>

            <l>The ſun darts forth, or hides his various ray;</l>
            <l>So high, ſo low, the lark aſpiring ſings,</l>
            <l>Or drops to earth again with folded wings;</l>
            <l>So ſmooth, ſo rough, the ſea that laves our ſhores,</l>
            <l>Smiles in a calm, or in a tempeſt roars.</l>
            <l>Believe me, Thomſon, 'tis not thus I write,</l>
            <l>Severely kind, by envy ſour'd or ſpite:</l>
            <l>Nor would I rob thy brows to grace my own;</l>
            <l>Such arts are to my honeſt ſoul unknown.</l>
            <l>I read thee over as a friend ſhould read,</l>
            <l>Griev'd when you fail, o'erjoy'd when you ſucceed.</l>
            <l>Why ſhould thy muſe, born ſo divinely fair,</l>
            <l>Want the reforming toilet's daily care?</l>
            <l>Dreſs the gay maid, improve each native grace,</l>
            <l>And call forth all the glories of her face:</l>
            <l>Studiouſly plain, and elegantly clean,</l>
            <l>With unaffected ſpeech, and eaſy mien,</l>
            <l>Th' accompliſh'd nymph, in all her beſt attire,</l>

            <l>To coin new words, or to reſtore the old,</l>
            <l>In ſouthern bards is dangerous and bold;</l>
            <l>But rarely, very rarely, will ſucceed,</l>

            <l>Shall learn from thee in bolder flights to riſe,</l>
            <l>To ſcorn the beaten road, and range the ſkies.</l>
            <l>A genius ſo refin'd, ſo juſt, ſo great,</l>

            <l>THus, when bleak winds their baleful influence ſhed,</l>
            <l>The lovely lilly droops her languid head;</l>
            <l>Till cheer'd by Sol's invigorating power,</l>
            <l>More fair revives the animated flower—</l>
            <l>With you reviv'd we grateful tribute pay,</l>
            <l>And bleſs the god of med'cine and of day.</l>
            <l>Poean, whoſe preſence health to mortals brings,</l>
            <l>Roſe on your bower with healing in his wings;</l>
            <l>And now rejoic'd we view, all mild and meek,</l>
            <l>Beams in your eye, and roſes on your cheek.</l>
            <l>As from the furnace glows the golden ore,</l>
            <l>Refin'd by fire, and brighter than before,</l>
            <l>So Amoret, new-clad in beauty's arms,</l>
            <l>Emerges irreſiſtable in charms.</l>
            <l>Thus late I ſaw, thro' Galileo's eyes,</l>
            <l>Venus, the ſplendid ſtar that gilds the ſkies,</l>
            <l>Immers'd within the ſun's refulgent rim,</l>
            <l>Her beams were faded, and her luſtre dim:</l>
            <l>Soon with freſh radiance glow'd her lovely face,</l>
            <l>The pride of evening, and the morning's grace:</l>
            <l>You now, dear Amoret, our lyres employ,</l>
            <l>Your late revival gives the public joy:</l>
            <l>No longer now your charms in ſhades you ſhroud,</l>
            <l>But riſe a brighter Venus from the cloud.</l>

            <l>WHere bold and graceful ſoars, ſecure of fame,</l>
            <l>The pile now worthy great Philippa's name,</l>
            <l>Mark that old ruin, Gothic and uncouth,</l>
            <l>Where the Black Edward paſs'd his beardleſs youth;</l>
            <l>And the Fifth Henry, for his firſt renown,</l>
            <l>Outſtripp'd each rival in a ſtudent's gown.</l>
            <l>In that coarſe age were princes fond to dwell</l>
            <l>With meagre monks, and haunt the ſilent cell;</l>
            <l>Sent from the monarch's to the muſe's court,</l>
            <l>Their meals were frugal, and their ſleeps were ſhort;</l>
            <l>To couch at curfeu-time they thought no ſcorn,</l>
            <l>And froze at mattins every winter morn;</l>
            <l>They read, an early book, the ſtarry frame,</l>
            <l>And liſp'd each conſtellation by its name;</l>
            <l>Art after art ſtill dawning to their view,</l>
            <l>And their mind opening as their ſtature grew.</l>

            <l>Nor took himſelf, but gave high heaven the praiſe?</l>
            <l>Thy nurſlings, antient dome! to virtue form'd,</l>

            <l>Deſcend triumphant to his antient ſeat,</l>
