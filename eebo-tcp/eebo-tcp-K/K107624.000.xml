            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> See no more Reason, why the Sordidness of some Workmen, should be the cause of contempt upon <hi>Manual Operations,</hi> than that the excellent Invention of a <hi>Mill</hi> should be dispis'd, because a blind Horse draws in it. And tho' the <hi>Mechanicks</hi> be, by some, accounted Ignoble and Scandalous? yet it is very well known, that many Gentlemen in this Nation, of good Rank and high Quality, are conversant in <hi>Handy-Works:</hi> And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations exceed us in numbers of such. How pleasant and healthey this their Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is, their Minds and Bodies find; and how Harmless and Honest, all sober men may judge?</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Geometry, Astronomy, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective, Musick, Navigation, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture,</hi> &amp;c. are excellent Sciences, all that know but their very Names will confess: Yet to what purpose would <hi>Geometry</hi> serve, were it not to contrive Rules for <hi>Handy-Works?</hi> Or how could <hi>Astronomy</hi> be known to any perfection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by Instruments made by Hand?
<pb facs="tcp:1212705000:5"/>
What <hi>Perspective</hi> should we have to delight our Sight? What <hi>Musick</hi> to ravish our Ears? What <hi>Navigation</hi> to Guard and Enrich our Country? Or what <hi>Architecture</hi> to defend us from the Inconveniencies of different Weather, without <hi>Manual Operations?</hi> Or how waste and useless would many of the Productions of this and other Counties be, were it not for <hi>Manufactures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To dive into the Original of the <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks</hi> is impossible, therefore I shall not offer at it; only I shall say, it is Rational to think, that the <hi>Mechanicks</hi> began with <hi>Man,</hi> he being the only Creature that Nature has imposed most Necessity upon to use it, endow'd with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Reason to contrive it, and adapted with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perest Members (as Instruments) to perform it.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it easie to find by any Authority, what part of the <hi>Mechanicks</hi> was first Practised by <hi>Man;</hi> therefore I shall wave that too, and only consider, that if we our selves were the first Men, what Branch of the <hi>Mechanicks</hi> we should first Need, and have recourse to.</p>
                  <p>I have considered, and Answer, That without the Invention of <hi>Smithing</hi> prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, most other <hi>Mechanick</hi> Invention
<pb facs="tcp:1212705000:6"/>
would be at a stand: The Instruments, or Tools, that are used in them, being either made of Iron, or some other matter, form'd by the help of Iron. But pray take Notice, that by Iron, I also mean Steel, it being originally Iron.</p>
                  <p>Nor would I have you understand, that when I name the <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> I mean that rough and Barbarous sort of working which is used by the Natives of <hi>America,</hi> and some other such Places; for, though they did indeed make Houses, Canoes, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Pots, Bows, Arrows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without the help of Iron, because they had then none amongst them: Yet since Iron is now known to them, they leave of their old way of working without it, and betake themselves to the use of it. Nor are, at this day, (though now they have in part the use of Iron) their <hi>Machines</hi> made by good and ready Rules of <hi>Art;</hi> for they know neither of <hi>Rule, Square,</hi> or <hi>Compass;</hi> and what they do, is done by Tedious Working, and he that has the best Eye at Guessing, works best upon the <hi>Straight, Square</hi> or <hi>Circle,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> in his <hi>Natural His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> reckons that <hi>Philosophy</hi> would be
<pb facs="tcp:1212705000:7"/>
improv'd, by having the Secrets of all Trades lye open; not only because much <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Philosophy,</hi> is Coucht amongst them; but also that the <hi>Trades</hi> themselves might, by a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> be improv'd. Besides, I find, that one <hi>Trade</hi> may borrow many Eminent Helps in <hi>Work</hi> of another <hi>Trade.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto I cannot learn that any hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken this Task, though I could have wisht it had been performed by an abler hand then mine; yet, since it is not, I have vetured upon it.</p>
                  <p>I thought to have given these <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,</hi> the Title of <hi>The Doctrine of Handy-Crafts;</hi> but when I better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered the true meaning of the Word <hi>Handy-Crafts,</hi> I found the <hi>Doctrine</hi> would not bear it; because <hi>Hand-Craft</hi> signifies <hi>Cunning,</hi> or <hi>Sleight,</hi> or <hi>Craft</hi> of the Hand, which cannot be taught by Words, but is only gained by <hi>Practise</hi> and <hi>Exercise;</hi> therefore I shall not undertake, that with the bare reading of these <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,</hi> any shall be able to perform these <hi>Handy-Works;</hi> but I may safely tell you, that these are the <hi>Rules</hi> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that will endeavour to perform
<pb facs="tcp:1212705000:8"/>
them must follow; and that by the true ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving them, he may, according to his stock of Ingenuity and Diligence, sooner or later, inure his hand to the <hi>Cunning</hi> or <hi>Craft</hi> of working like a <hi>Handy-Craft,</hi> and consequently be able to perform them in time.</p>
                  <p>For the Reason aforesaid I intend to begin with <hi>Smithing,</hi> which comprehends not only the <hi>Black-Smith's Trade,</hi> but takes in all <hi>Trades</hi> which use either <hi>Forge</hi> or <hi>File,</hi> from the <hi>Anchor-Smith,</hi> to the <hi>Watch-Maker;</hi> they all working by the same <hi>Rules,</hi> tho' not with equal exactness, and all using the same <hi>Tools,</hi> tho' of several Sizes from those the common <hi>Black-Smith</hi> uses, and that according to the various purposes they are applied to: And in order to it, I shall first shew you how to set up a <hi>Forge,</hi> and what <hi>Tools</hi> you must use in the <hi>Black-Smith's</hi> work; then the <hi>Rules,</hi> and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Circumstances</hi> of <hi>Forging,</hi> till your Work come to the <hi>File:</hi> Then of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sorts of Iron that are commonly used; and what sort is fittest for each purpose. Afterwards of <hi>Filing</hi> in general, and the <hi>Rules</hi> to be observed in it, in the making of
<pb facs="tcp:1212705000:9"/>
                     <hi>Jacks, Hinges, Screws, Clocks, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> &amp;c. In which Examples, you will find all other Sorts of <hi>Forging</hi> or <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> work whatsoever comprehended. And lastly, as a close to <hi>Smithing,</hi> I shall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise upon <hi>Steel,</hi> and its several Sorts, and how to Order and Temper it for its several Uses; and what Sort is fittest for each particular purpose; as which is fittest for <hi>Edge-Tools,</hi> which for <hi>Springs,</hi> which for <hi>Punches,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Some perhaps would have thought it more Proper, to have introduced these <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises</hi> with a more Curious, and less Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Art, than that of <hi>Smithing;</hi> but I am not of their Opinion; for <hi>Smithing</hi> is in all parts, as curious a <hi>Handy-Craft,</hi> as any is: Besides, it is a great Introduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion to most other <hi>Handy-Works,</hi> as <hi>Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, Turning,</hi> &amp;c. they (with the <hi>Smith</hi>) working upon the <hi>Straight, Square,</hi> or <hi>Circle,</hi> though with different <hi>Tools,</hi> upon different <hi>Matter;</hi> and they all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving dependance upon the <hi>Smith's Trade,</hi> and not the <hi>Smith</hi> upon them.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>SMITHING is an Art-Manual, by which an irregular Lump (or several Lumps) of Iron, is wrought into an intended Shape.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Definition, needs no Explanation; therefore I shall proceed to give you an Account of the Tools a Smith uses; not but that (they being so common) I suppose you do already know them; but partly because they may require some precaution in setting them up fittest to your use; and partly because it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves you to know the Names, Smiths call the several parts of them by; that when I name them in Smith's Language (as I shall oft have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to do in these <hi>Exercises</hi>) you may the easier understand them, as you read them.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Hearth,</hi> or Fire-place of the <hi>Forge</hi> mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed A. (in Plate 1.) is to be built up from your floor with Brick about two foot and an half, or sometimes two foot nine Inches high, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the purpose you design your <hi>Forge</hi> for; for if your <hi>Forge</hi> be intended for heavy work, your <hi>Hearth</hi> must lie lower than it need be for light
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1212705000:14"/>
work, for easiness of management, and so broad as you think convenient: It may be built with hollow Arches underneath, to set several things out of the way. The Back of the <hi>Forge</hi> is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to the top of the Ceiling, and inclosed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Fire-place with a <hi>Hovel,</hi> which ends in a <hi>Chimney</hi> to carry away the Smoak, as B. In the back of the <hi>Forge</hi> against the Fire-place, is fixed a thick Iron Plate, and a taper Pipe in it about five Inches long, called a <hi>Tewel,</hi> or (as some call it) a <hi>Tewel-Iron</hi> marked *, which Pipe comes through the Back of the <hi>Forge,</hi> as at C. Into this taper Pipe or <hi>Tewel</hi> is placed the Nose, or Pipe of the <hi>Bellows.</hi> The Office of this <hi>Tewel,</hi> is only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Pipe of the Bellows, and the back of the <hi>Forge</hi> about the Fire-place from burning. Right against the Back is placed at about twenty Inches, or two foot distance, the <hi>Trough,</hi> and reaches commonly through the whole breadth of the <hi>Forge,</hi> and is as broad and deep as you think good, as at D. The <hi>Bellows</hi> is placed behind the Back of the <hi>Forge,</hi> and hath as aforesaid, its Pipe fitted into the Pipe of the <hi>Tewel,</hi> and hath one of its Boards fixed so that it move not upwards or downwards. At the Ear of the upper Bellows board is fastened a <hi>Rope,</hi> or sometimes a <hi>Thong</hi> of Leather, or an Iron <hi>Chain</hi> or <hi>Rod,</hi> as E; which reaches up to the <hi>Rocker,</hi> and is fastened there to the farther end of the Handle, as at F. This <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> is fastened a cross a <hi>Rock-staff,</hi> which moves between two Cheeks upon the <hi>Center-pins,</hi> in two Sockets, as at G. So that by drawing down this Handle, the moving Board of the <hi>Bellows</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and by a considerable weight set on the top of its upper Board sinks down again, and by this Agitation performs the Office of a pair of <hi>Bellows.</hi>

                     <p>THE shape of a Black Smith's <hi>Anvil</hi> I have inserted in this Figure, though it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made with a <hi>Pike,</hi> or <hi>Bickern,</hi> or <hi>Beak-iron,</hi> at one end of it, whose use I shall shew you when I come to round hollow work. Its <hi>Face</hi> must be very flat and smooth, without Flaws, and so hard that <hi>a File will not touch it</hi> (as Smiths say, when a File will not cut, or race it.) The upper Plain A. is called the <hi>Face;</hi> it is commonly set upon a wooden <hi>Block,</hi> that it may stand very steady and solid, and about two foot high from the floor, or sometimes higher, according to the stature of the Person that is to work at it.</p>

                     <p>THere are two sorts of <hi>Tongs</hi> used by Smiths; the one the <hi>Straight-nosed Tongs,</hi> used when the work is short, and somewhat flat, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally for all Plate Iron. The other <hi>Crooked-nos'd Tongs,</hi> to be used for the forging small Bars, or such thicker work, as will be held within the Returns of their <hi>Chaps.</hi> The <hi>Chaps</hi> are placed near the Joint, because, that considering the length of the <hi>Handles,</hi> they hold the Iron faster than they would do, were they placed farther from the Joint, as in the Fig. 3.4. A the <hi>Chaps,</hi> B the <hi>Joint,</hi> CC the <hi>Handles.</hi>

                     <p>THere are several sorts of <hi>Hammers</hi> used by Black-Smiths; as first the <hi>Hand-hammer,</hi> which is sometimes bigger, or less, according to the Strength of the Work-man; but it is a <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> of such weight, that it may be weilded, or governed, with one hand at the <hi>Anvil.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Up-hand Sledge,</hi> used by under-Workmen, when the Work is not of the largest, yet requires

help to batter, or <hi>draw it out;</hi> they use it with both their hands before them, and seldom lift their <hi>Hammer</hi> higher than their head. Thirdly, the <hi>About Sledge</hi> is the biggest <hi>Hammer</hi> of all, and is also used by under-Workmen, for the batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or <hi>drawing out</hi> of the largest Work; and then they hold the farther end of the <hi>Handle</hi> in both their Hands, and swinging the <hi>Sledge</hi> above their Heads, they at Arms end let fall as heavy a Blow as they can upon the Work. There is also another <hi>Hammer</hi> used by them, which they call a <hi>Rivetting-hammer.</hi> This is the smallest <hi>Hammer</hi> of all, and very rarely used at the <hi>Forge,</hi> unless your Work prove very small; but upon cold I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron it is used for rivetting, or setting straight, or crooking small work.

You must have several Sizes of <hi>Drills,</hi> according as your work may require. The shape in Fig. 8. is enough to shew the Fashion of it; but it must be made of good Steel, and well temper'd.

                     <p>I Think it needless to tell you how to make your Fire, or blow it, because they are both but Labourers work; nor how little, or big, it need to be, for your own reason will, by the Size of your work, teach you that; only let me tell you the Phrase Smiths use for [make the Fire] is, <hi>Blow up the Fire,</hi> or sometimes, <hi>Blow up the Coals.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When it is burning with the Iron in it, you must, with the <hi>Slice,</hi> clap the Coals upon the out-side close together, to keep the heat in the body of the Fire; and as oft as you find the Fire begin to break out, clap them close again, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1212705000:20"/>
with the <hi>Washer</hi> dipt in Water, wet the out-side of the Fire to damp the out-side, as well to save Coals, as to strike the force of the Fire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the in-side, that your work may heat the sooner. But you ought oft to draw your work a little way out of the Fire, to see how it <hi>takes its Heat,</hi> and quickly thrust it in again, if it be not hot enough: For each purpose your work is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to, ought to have a proper <hi>Heat</hi> suitable to that purpose, as I shall shew you in the several <hi>Heats</hi> of Iron: For if it be too cold, it will not <hi>feel the weight of the Hammer</hi> (as Smiths say, when it will not batter under the <hi>Hammer</hi>) and if it be too hot, it will <hi>Red-sear,</hi> that is, break, or crack under the <hi>Hammer,</hi> while it is working between hot and cold.</p>

                     <p>THere are several degrees of <hi>Heats</hi> Smiths take of their Iron, each according to the purpose of their work. As first, a <hi>Blood-red Heat.</hi> Secondly, a <hi>White Flame Heat.</hi> Thirdly, a <hi>Spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> or <hi>Welding Heat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Blood-red Heat</hi> is used when Iron hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready its form and size, as sometimes square Bars, and Iron Plates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have, but may want a little Hammering to smooth it. Use then the Face of your <hi>Hand-hammer,</hi> and with light flat Blows, hammer down the irregular Risings into the Body of your Iron, till it be smooth enough for the File. And note<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it behoves a good Workman, to hammer his Work as true as he can; for one quarter of an hour spent at the <hi>Forge,</hi> may save him an hours work at the <hi>Vice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Flame,</hi> or <hi>White Heat,</hi> is used when your Iron hath not its Form or Size, but must be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into both; and then you must take a piece of Iron thick enough, and with the <hi>Pen</hi> of your
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1212705000:21"/>
                        <hi>Hammer,</hi> (or sometimes, according to the size of your work, use two or three pair of hands with <hi>Sledges</hi> to) batter it out; or, as Workmen call it, to <hi>draw it out,</hi> till it comes to its breadth, and pretty near its shape; and so by several <hi>Heats,</hi> if your work require them, frame it into Form and Size; then with the Face of your <hi>Hand-hammer,</hi> smooth your work from the Dents the <hi>Pen</hi> made, as you did with a <hi>Blood-red Heat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Sparkling,</hi> or <hi>Welding-heat,</hi> is only used when you <hi>double up</hi> your Iron (as Smiths call it) to make it thick enough for your purpose, and so <hi>weld,</hi> or work in the <hi>doubling</hi> into one another, and make it become one entire lump; or it is used when you join several Bars of Iron toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make them thick enough for your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and work them into one Bar; or else it is used when you are to join, or <hi>weld</hi> two pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Iron together end to end, to make them long enough; but, in this case, you must be very quick at the <hi>Forge;</hi> for when your two ends are throughout of a good <hi>Heat,</hi> and that the inside of the Iron be almost ready to Run, as well as the outside, you must very hastily snatch them both out of the Fire together, and (after you have with the Edge of your <hi>Hammer</hi> scraped off such Scales or Dirt as may hinder their incorporating) with your utmost diligence clap your left hand-piece, upon your right hand-piece, and with all speed (lest you lose some part of your good Heat) fall to Hammering them together, and work them soundly into one another: and this, if your Bars be large, will require another, or somtimes two or three pair of Hands besides your own to do: but if it be not throughly <hi>welded</hi> at the first <hi>Heat,</hi> you must reiterate your <hi>Heats</hi> so oft, till they be throughly <hi>welded;</hi> then with a <hi>Flame-heat</hi> (as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1212705000:22"/>
before) shape it, and afterwards smooth it with a <hi>Blood-red Heat.</hi> To make your Iron come the sooner to a <hi>Welding-heat,</hi> you must now and then with your <hi>Hearth-staff</hi> stir up the Fire, and throw up those Cinders the Iron may have run upon; for they will never burn well, but spoil the rest of the Coals; and take a little white Sand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your Finger and your Thumb, and throw upon the heating Iron, then with your Slice, quickly clap the outside of your Fire down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and with your <hi>Washer</hi> dipt in Water, damp the outside of the Fire to keep the Heat in.</p>
                     <p>But you must take special Care that your I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron <hi>burn</hi> not in the Fire, that is, that it do not <hi>run</hi> or melt; for then your Iron will be so brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that it will not endure Forging without breaking, and so hard, that a <hi>File</hi> will not touch it.</p>
                     <p>Some Smiths use to strew a little white Sand upon the <hi>Face</hi> of the <hi>Anvil</hi> also, when they are to hammer upon a <hi>Welding-heat;</hi> for they say it makes the Iron <hi>weld,</hi> or incorporate the better.</p>
                     <p>If through Mistake, or ill management, your Iron be too thin, or too narrow towards one of the ends; then if you have substance enough (and yet not too long) you may <hi>up-set</hi> it, that is, take a <hi>Flame-heat,</hi> and set the heated end up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right upon the <hi>Anvil,</hi> and hammer upon the cold end, till the heated end be beat, or <hi>up-set,</hi> into the Body of your Work. But if it be a long piece of Work, and you fear its length may wrong the middle, you must hold it in your left hand, and lay it flat on the <hi>Anvil;</hi> but so as the heated end intended to be <hi>up-set,</hi> may lie a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle over the further side of the <hi>Anvil,</hi> and then with your <hi>Hand-hammer</hi> in your right hand, beat upon the heated end of your work, minding that every stroak you take, you hold your work

stiff against the <hi>Face</hi> of the <hi>Hammer.</hi> Afterwards smooth it again with a <hi>Blood-red Heat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you are to Forge a <hi>Shoulder</hi> on one, or each side of your work, lay the Shank of your Iron at the place where your <hi>Shoulder</hi> must be on the edge of your <hi>Anvil</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that edge which is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to your hand) that if more <hi>Shoulders</hi> be to be made, turn them all successively, and ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer your Iron so, as that the Shank of the Iron that lies on the flat of the <hi>Anvil,</hi> feel as well the weight of your Blows, as the <hi>Shoulder</hi> at the edge of the <hi>Anvil</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for should you lay your blows on the edge of the <hi>Anvil</hi> only, it would instead of flatting the Shank to make the <hi>Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> cut your work through.</p>
                     <p>Your Work will sometimes require to have holes punched in it at the Forge, you must then make a Steel <hi>Punch</hi> to the size and shape of the hole you are to strike, and harden the point of it without tempering, because the heat of the Iron will soften it fast enough, and sometimes too fast, but then you must re-harden it; then taking a <hi>Blood-heat</hi> of your Iron, or if it be very large, almost a <hi>Flame-heat;</hi> lay it upon your <hi>Anvil,</hi> and with your left hand, place the point of the <hi>Punch</hi> where the hole must be, and with the <hi>Hand-hammer</hi> in your right hand punch the hole; or if your work be heavy, you may hold it in your left hand, and with your Punch fixed at the end of a <hi>Hoop-stick,</hi> or some such Wood, hold the stick in your right hand, and place the point of your <hi>Punch</hi> on the work where the hole must be, and let another Man strike, till your Punch come pretty near the bottom of your work; which when it does, the sides of your work round about the hole, will rise from the Face of the <hi>Anvil,</hi> and your Punch will print a bunching mark upon the hole of a <hi>Bolster,</hi> that is,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1212705000:24"/>
a thick Iron with a hole in it, and placing your Punch, as before, strike it through. But you must note, that as oft as you see your Punch heat, or change Colour, you take it out of the hole, and pop it into Water to re-harden it, or else it will batter in the hole you intend to strike, and not only spoil it self, but the Work too, by running aside in the Work. Having punched it through on the one side, turn the other side of your work, and with your Hammer set it flat and straight, and with a <hi>Blood-heat</hi> punch it through on the other side also; so shall that hole be fit for the <hi>File,</hi> or square bore, if the curiosity of your purposed Work cannot allow it to pass without filing. When your Work is Forged, do not quench it in water to cool it, but throw it down upon the <hi>Floor,</hi> or <hi>Hearth,</hi> to cool of it self; for the quenching it in water will harden it; as I shall shortly shew you, when I come to the Tempering of Steel.</p>

                     <p>YOU may have occasion sometimes to <hi>Braze</hi> or <hi>Solder</hi> a piece of work; but it is used by Smiths only, when their work is so thin, or small, that it will not endure <hi>Welding.</hi> To do this, take small pieces of Brass, and lay them on the place that must be brazed, and strew a little Glass beaten to powder on it to make it run the sooner, and give it a <hi>Heat</hi> in the <hi>Forge,</hi> till (by sometimes drawing it a little way out of the Fire) you see the Brass run. But if your work be so small, or thin, that you may fear the Iron will run as soon as the Brass, and so you lose your work in the Fire, then you must make a <hi>Loam</hi> of three parts Clay, and one part Horse-dung, and after they are wrought and mingled very well together in your hands, wrap your work with the Brass, and a little beaten Glass upon

                     <p>Thus much of Forging in general. It remains now, that you know what sorts of Iron are fittest for the several Uses, you may have occasion to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them.</p>

                     <head>Of several Sorts of <hi>Iron,</hi> and their proper Uses.</head>
                     <p>IT is not my purpose, in this place, to tell you how Iron is made, I shall defer that till I come to treat of Mettals, and their Refinings. Let it at present satisfie those that know it not, that Iron is, by a violent Fire, melted out of hard Stones, called <hi>Iron-Stones;</hi> of these <hi>Iron-Stones,</hi> many Countries have great plenty. But because it wastes such great quantities of Wood to draw the Iron from them, it will not, in many Places, quit cost to use them. In most parts of <hi>England,</hi> we have abundance of these <hi>Iron-Stones;</hi> but our <hi>English</hi> Iron, is generally a course sort of Iron, hard and brittle, fit for Fire-bars, and other such course Uses; unless it be about the Forrest of <hi>Dean,</hi> and some few places more, where the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron proves very good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Swedish</hi> Iron is of all Sorts, the best we use in <hi>England.</hi> It is a fine tough sort of Iron, will best en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Hammer, and is softest to file; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore most coveted by Workmen, to work upon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Spanish</hi> Iron, would be as good as <hi>Swedish</hi> Iron, were it not subject to <hi>Red-sear,</hi> (as Workmen phrase it) that is to crack betwixt hot and cold. Therefore when it falls under your hands, you
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1212705000:26"/>
must tend it more earnestly at the Forge. But tho' it be good, tough, soft Iron, yet for many Uses, Workmen will refuse it, because it is so ill, and un-evenly wrought in the Bars, that it costs them a great deal of labour to smooth it; but it is good for all great works that require <hi>welding,</hi> as the bodies of Anvils, Sledges, large Bell-clappers, large Pestles for Mortars, &amp; all thick strong Bars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is particularly chosen by <hi>Anchor-Smiths,</hi> because it abides the Heat better than other Iron, and when it is well wrought, is toughest.</p>
                     <p>There is some Iron comes from <hi>Holland</hi> (tho' in no great quantity) but is made in <hi>Germany.</hi> This Iron is called <hi>Dort Squares,</hi> only because it comes to us from thence, and is wrought into square Bars three quarters of an Inch square. It is a bad, course Iron, and only fit for slight Uses, as Window-Bars, Brewers-Bars, Fire-Bars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is another sort of Iron used for making of <hi>Wyer,</hi> which of all Sorts is the softest and toughest: But this Sort is not peculiar to any Country, but is indifferently made where any Iron is made, though of the worst sort; for it is the first Iron that runs from the <hi>Stone</hi> when it is melting, and is only preserved or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Wyer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By what hath been said, you may see that the softest and toughest Iron is the best: Therefore when you chuse Iron, chuse such as bows oftenest before it break, which is an Argument of tough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and see it break sound within, be grey of Colour like broken Lead, and free from such glistering Specks you see in broken <hi>Antimony,</hi> no flaws or divisions in it; for these are Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THE several sorts of Files that are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon use are the <hi>Square,</hi> the <hi>Flat,</hi> the <hi>three Square,</hi> the <hi>half Round,</hi> the <hi>Round,</hi> the <hi>Thin File, &amp;c.</hi> All these shapes you must have of several <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes,</hi> and of several <hi>Cuts.</hi> You must have them of several sizes, as well because you may have seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sizes of work, as for that it sometimes falls out that one piece of work may have many parts in it joined and fitted to one another, some of them great, and others small; And you must have them of several <hi>Cuts,</hi> because the <hi>Rough-tooth'd File</hi> cuts faster than the <hi>Bastard-tooth'd File,</hi> the <hi>Fine-tooth'd File</hi> faster than the <hi>Smooth-tooth'd File.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Rough</hi> or <hi>Course-tooth'd File</hi> (which if it be large, is called a <hi>Rubber</hi>) is to take off the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenness of your work which the <hi>Hammer</hi> made in the Forging; the <hi>Bastard-tooth'd file</hi> is to take out of your work, the deep cuts, or file-strokes, the <hi>Rough-file</hi> made; the <hi>Fine-tooth'd file</hi> is to take out the cuts, or file-strokes, the <hi>Bastard-file</hi> made; and the <hi>Smooth-file</hi> is to take out those cuts, or file-strokes, that the <hi>Fine file</hi> made.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see how the <hi>Files</hi> of several <hi>Cuts</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed one another, till your Work is so smooth as it can be filed. You may make it yet smoother with <hi>Emerick, Tripoli, &amp;c.</hi> But of that in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, because it suits not with this Section of <hi>Filing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You must take care when you use the <hi>Rough File,</hi> that you go very lightly over those dents the <hi>Hammer</hi> made in your work, unless your work be forged somewhat of the strongest, for the dents being irregularities in your work, if you should file away as much in them, as you do off the Eminencies or Risings, your work (whether it be straight or circular) would be as irregular, as it was before you filed it: And
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1212705000:28"/>
when you file upon the Prominent, or rising Parts of your Work, with your <hi>course cut File,</hi> you must also take care that you file them not more away than you need, for you may easily be deceived; because the <hi>course File</hi> cuts deep, and makes deep scratches in the Work; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can take out those deep scratches with your finer cut Files, those places where the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings were when your work was forged, may become dents to your Hammer dents; therefore file not those Risings quite so low, as the dents the Hammer made, but only so low as that the scratches the <hi>Rough-file</hi> makes may lie as low, or deep in your work, as your Hammer dents do; for then, when you come with your smoother Cut Files, after your <hi>Rough-file,</hi> the scratches of your <hi>Rough-file,</hi> and your Hammer-strokes, or dents, may both come out together. But to do this with greater certainty, hold your File so, that you may keep so much of the length of your File as you can to rub, range, (or, as near range as you can) upon the length of your work; for so shall the File enter upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Rising on your work, before it goes off the first, and will slip over, and not touch the dent or hollow between the two Risings, till your Risings are brought into a straight line with your hollow dent. But of this more shall be said when I come to the Practice of Filing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon several particular sorts of work.</p>
                     <p>If it be a square Bar, (or such like) you are to file upon, all its Angles, or Edges, must be left very sharp and straight. Therefore your <hi>Vice</hi> being well set up, according to foregoing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, you must in your filing athwart over the <hi>Chaps</hi> of the <hi>Vice,</hi> be sure to carry both your hands you hold the <hi>file</hi> in, truly Horizontal, or flat over the Work; for should you let either of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1212705000:29"/>
your hands mount, the other would dip, and the edge of that Square it dips upon would be taken off; and should you let your hand move never so little circularly, both the Edges you file upon would be taken off, and the Middle of your intended Flat would be left with a Rising on it. But this Hand-craft, you must attain to by Practice; for it is the great Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity in Filing.</p>
                     <p>If it be a round Piece, or Rod of Iron, you are to file upon, what you were forbid upon Square Work, you must perform on the Round for you must dip your Handle-hand, and mount your end-hand a little, and laying pritting near the end of your File to the Work, file circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly upon the Work, by mounting your Handle-hand by degrees, and dipping your End-hand, in such manner, as when the Middle of your File comes about the top of your Work, your File may be flat upon it, and as you continue your stroaks forwards, still keep your hands moving circularly till you have finished your full Stroak, that is, a Stroak the whole length of the File. By this manner of Circular filing, you keep your Piece, or Rod round; but should you file flat upon the top of your work, so many times as you shall remove, or turn your work in the <hi>Vice,</hi> so many Flats, or Squares, you would have in your work; which is contrary to your purpose.</p>
                     <p>When you thrust your <hi>File</hi> forwards, lean hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon it, because the <hi>Teeth</hi> of the <hi>File</hi> are made to cut forwards; but when you draw your <hi>File</hi> back, to recover another thrust, lift, or bear the File lightly just above the work; for it cuts not coming back.</p>

                        <p>When you cut out an <hi>Hinge,</hi> you must leave on the length of the Plate AB in this Figure, Plate enough to lap over for the <hi>Joints,</hi> I mean, to <hi>Turn,</hi> or <hi>Double</hi> about a round Pin, so big as you intend the Pin of your <hi>Hinge</hi> shall be, and also Plate enough to <hi>Weld</hi> upon the inside of the <hi>Hinge</hi> below the <hi>Pin-hole</hi> of the <hi>Joint,</hi> that the <hi>Joint</hi> may be strong.</p>

                           <hi>Tail-piece,</hi> as at DD, till the <hi>Joint</hi> at C fit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly into the Notch in the <hi>Cross,</hi> and that when the <hi>Pin</hi> is put into the <hi>Pin-hole</hi> DD on the <hi>Cross,</hi> the <hi>Pin-hole</hi> in the <hi>Tail-piece</hi> may also receive the <hi>Pin;</hi> then by holding the <hi>Tail-piece</hi> in one Hand, and the <hi>Cross</hi> in the other, double the <hi>Tail</hi> and <hi>Cross</hi> towards one another, to try if they move evenly and smoothly without shaking on the <hi>Pin;</hi> which if they do, the <hi>Joint</hi> is made; if they do not, you must examine where the Fault is, and taking the <hi>Pin</hi> out, mend the Fault in the <hi>Joint.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then <hi>File</hi> down all the Irregularities the <hi>Cold-Chissel</hi> made on the Edges of your Work, and (if the Curiosity of Work require it) <hi>file</hi> also the outer Flat of your Work. But tho' <hi>Smiths</hi> that make Quantities of <hi>Hinges,</hi> do <hi>brighten</hi> them, (as they call it) yet they seldom <hi>file</hi> them, but <hi>Grinde</hi> them on a Grindstone till they become <hi>bright,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Having finished the <hi>Joint,</hi> put the <hi>Pin</hi> in again; but take care it be a little longer than the Depth of the <hi>Joint,</hi> because you must batter the Ends of the <hi>Pin</hi> over the outer Edges of the <hi>Pin-hole,</hi> that the <hi>Pin</hi> may not drop out when either Edge of the <hi>Cross</hi> is turned upwards.</p>
                        <p>The chiefest Curiosity in the making these, and, indeed, all other <hi>Hinges</hi> is, 1. That the <hi>Pin-hole</hi> be exactly round, and not too wide for the <hi>Pin.</hi> 2. That the <hi>Joints</hi> are let exactly into one another, that they have no play between them, lest they shake upwards or downwards, nor yet are forced too hard into one another, lest when they are nailed on the Door, the <hi>Joint</hi> be in Danger of Breaking. 3. That the <hi>Cross,</hi> and the <hi>Tail</hi> lie on the Under-side exactly flat, for should they warp out of flat when they are nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, the Nails would draw the <hi>Joint</hi> a-wry, and not only make it move hard, and unevenly, but by oft Opening and Shutting break the <hi>Joint.</hi> 4.

                        </p>
                        <p>First, Cut out of an Iron Plate with a <hi>Cold-Chissel,</hi> the Size and Shape of the <hi>Main-Plate,</hi> as you were taught to cut the <hi>Cross</hi> and <hi>Tail-piece</hi> of the <hi>Cross-Garnet</hi>; then consider what Depth you intend the <hi>Bit</hi> of the <hi>Key</hi> shall have, and set that Depth off on the <hi>Main-Plate,</hi> by leaving about half an Inch of Plate between the Bottom of the <hi>Key-hole,</hi> and the Lower Edge of the <hi>Main-Plate,</hi> as at C (or more or less, according to the Size of the <hi>Lock.</hi>) Then measure with a Pair of <hi>Composses</hi> between the Bottom of the <hi>Bit,</hi> and the <hi>Centre</hi> of your <hi>Key</hi> (or your intended <hi>Key</hi>) and set that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance off from C to B, near the Middle between the two Ends of the <hi>Main-Plate,</hi> and with the <note n="(a)" place="bottom">A <hi>Prick-punch,</hi> is a Piece of temper'd Steel, with a round Point at one End, to prick a round Mark in cold Iron.</note> 
                           <hi>Prick-punch,</hi> make there a Mark to set one <hi>Foot</hi> of your <hi>Compasses</hi> in, then opening your <hi>Compasses</hi> to the Middle of the <hi>Bit</hi> of your intended <hi>Key,</hi> as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1212705000:37"/>
to D, describe the Arch EDE for the true Place the <hi>Top-hoop</hi> must stand on.</p>
                        <p>Then cut one other Piece of Plate as AAAA in <hi>Fig.</hi> 3. for a <hi>Cover-plate,</hi> with two Pieces one on each side, long enough to make <hi>Studs</hi> of to turn downwards, and then outward again as FF, GG, that the <hi>Cover-plate</hi> may stand off the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> the Breadth of the <hi>Bit</hi> of the <hi>Key</hi>; and at the two End of these <hi>Studs</hi> Punch holes, as GG, to <hi>Rivet</hi> the <hi>Cover-plate</hi> into the <hi>Main-plate.</hi> In the Middle of this Plate make the <hi>Centre,</hi> as at B, then open your <hi>Compasses</hi> to three Quarters the Length of the <hi>Bit,</hi> and half the Diameter of the <hi>Shank</hi> of the <hi>Key,</hi> and placing one <hi>Foot</hi> in the Point B, describe with the other <hi>Foot</hi> the Arch DCD for the true Place of the <hi>Main-ward,</hi> then set your <hi>Compasses</hi> to a little more than half the Diameter of the <hi>Shank,</hi> and place one <hi>Foot</hi> (as before) in the <hi>Centre</hi> B, and with the other <hi>Foot</hi> describe the small Arch E, for the true Place the <hi>Step-ward,</hi> or (as some call it) the <hi>Dap-ward</hi> must stand: So have you the true Places of the <hi>Wards,</hi> for an ordinary <hi>Spring-Lock</hi>; you may (if the Depth of your <hi>Bit</hi> will bear it) put more <hi>Wards</hi> in your Plates. But you must note, that the more <hi>Wards</hi> you put in, the weaker you make your <hi>Key</hi>; because that to every <hi>Ward</hi> on the Plates, you must make a Slit, or <hi>Ward</hi> in the <hi>Bit</hi> of the <hi>Key</hi>; and the more <hi>Wards</hi> you make, the weaker the Iron of the <hi>Bit</hi> will be; and then if the <hi>Bolt</hi> shoot not easily backwards, or forwards, the <hi>Bit</hi> may be in Danger of Breaking.</p>
                        <p>Having marked on your Plates the Places of all your <hi>Wards,</hi> you must take thin Plate, and with <hi>Hammering</hi> and <hi>Filing</hi> make them both <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                              <hi>Hammer-hard,</hi> is when you harden Iron, or Steel, with much hammering on it.</note> 
                           <hi>Hammer-hard,</hi> and of equal Thickness all the way. Then <hi>file</hi> one Edge very straight, by laying a <hi>straight Ruler</hi> just within the Edge of it, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or racing with a Point of hardned Steel, a bright Line by the side of the <hi>Ruler; File</hi> away
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1212705000:38"/>
the Edge of the Plate to that Line, then draw (as before) another straight Line Parallel to the first straight Line, or which is all one, Parallel to the filed Edge, just of the Breadth you intend the <hi>Wards</hi> shall be, and file as before, only, you must leave two, or sometimes three <hi>Studs</hi> upon this Plate, one near each End, and the other in the Middle, to <hi>Rivet</hi> into the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> to keep the <hi>Ward</hi> fixt in its Place. Therefore you must take care when you elect this thin Piece of Plate, that it be broad enough for the <hi>Ward,</hi> and these Studs too. Then laying the Plate a-thwart the <hi>Pike</hi> of the <hi>Bickern,</hi> hold your Hand even with the <hi>Face</hi> of the <hi>Bickern,</hi> and <hi>hammer</hi> this Plate down somewhat by the side of the <hi>Pike,</hi> and by Degrees you may (with care taken) bring it unto a circular Form, just of the Size of that Circle you described on the <hi>Main-plate</hi>; which when you have done, you must apply this <hi>Ward</hi> to the Circle you described on the <hi>Main-plate</hi>; setting it in the Position you intend it shall be fixed, and marking with a Steel Point where the <hi>Studs</hi> stand upon that Circle, in those marks <hi>Punch</hi> holes to <hi>Rivet</hi> the <hi>Studs</hi> to. Work so by all the other <hi>Wards.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If you have a <hi>Pin</hi> to the <hi>Lock, Punch</hi> a Hole through the <hi>Centre</hi> on the <hi>Cover-plate,</hi> somewhat smaller than the Wyre you are to make your <hi>Pin</hi> of, because you may then <hi>file</hi> one End of the <hi>Pin</hi> away to a <hi>Shank,</hi> which must fit the smaller Hole on the Plate, and the whole Thickness of the <hi>Pin</hi> will be a <hi>Sholder,</hi> which will keep the <hi>Pin</hi> steddy in the <hi>Centre-hole</hi> of the Plate, when the <hi>Pin</hi> is <hi>rivetted</hi> into the Plate. But because there is some Skill to be used in <hi>Rivetting,</hi> I shall, before I proceed any farther, teach you</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>RIvetting</hi> is to batter the Edges of a <hi>Shank</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Plate, or other Iron, the <hi>Shank</hi> is let into, so as the Plate, or other Iron, may be clinched close, and fixed between the Battering at the End of the <hi>Shank</hi> and the <hi>Sholder.</hi> So that</p>
                        <p>When you <hi>Rivet</hi> a <hi>Pin</hi> into a Hole, your <hi>Pin</hi> must have a <hi>Sholder</hi> to it thicker than the Hole is wide, that the <hi>Sholder</hi> slip not through the Hole, as well as the <hi>Shank</hi>; but the <hi>Shank</hi> of the <hi>Pin</hi> must be exactly of the Size of the Hole the <hi>Shank</hi> must be <hi>Rivetted</hi> into, and somewhat longer than the Plate is thick; <hi>file</hi> the End of the <hi>Shank</hi> flat, so shall the Edges of the End, the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silier batter over the Plate; then put your <hi>Shank</hi> into the Hole, wherein it is to be <hi>Rivetted,</hi> but be sure you force the <hi>Shank</hi> close up to the <hi>Sholder</hi>; then turn the Top of this <hi>Sholder</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (Plate and all) upon your <hi>Stake,</hi> but lay it so, as that the <hi>Sholder</hi> lie solid, and the <hi>Shank,</hi> at the same time, stand directly upright, and with your left Hand, keep your Work bearing hard upon the Flat, or <hi>Face</hi> of the <hi>Stake.</hi> Then holding your <hi>Hammer</hi> in your Right-hand, hold the Edge of the <hi>Face</hi> of it Dripping a-slope from the Right-hand outwards, and lay pretty light Blows upon the Edge of the End of the <hi>Shank,</hi> turning with your Left-hand your Work round to the <hi>Face</hi> of the <hi>Hammer,</hi> till you have battered the Edges of the <hi>Shank</hi> quite round about; but this is seldom done, with once turning your Work about; therefore you may thus work it round again and again, till you find it is pretty well <hi>Rivetted;</hi> then lay heavier Blows upon it, sometimes with the <hi>Face,</hi> sometimes with the <hi>Pen</hi> of the <hi>Hammer,</hi> till the End of the <hi>Shank</hi> is bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered effectually over the Plate.</p>
                        <p>One main Consideration in <hi>Rivetting</hi> is, that the <hi>Pin</hi> you <hi>rivet</hi> in, stand upright to the Plate,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1212705000:40"/>
or other Iron you <hi>rivet</hi> it upon; for if it do not stand upright, you will be forced to set it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, after it is <hi>rivetted,</hi> either in the <hi>Vice,</hi> or with your <hi>Plyers,</hi> or with your <hi>Hammer,</hi> and that may, if your Plate be thin, bow it, or if it be thick, break the Shank, or else the <hi>Sholder</hi> of your <hi>Rivet,</hi> and so you lose your Labour, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times spoil your Work.</p>
                        <p>Another Consideration is, that when you <hi>rivet</hi> a <hi>Pin</hi> to any Plate, and you fear it may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards twist about by some force that may be offered it, you must, to provide against this Danger, <hi>file</hi> the <hi>Shank</hi> you intend to <hi>Rivet,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Square, or Triangular, and make the Hole in the Plate you <hi>rivet</hi> it into, of the same Size and Form, and then <hi>rivet</hi> in the <hi>Shank,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. There are two ways to make your Hole, Square or Triangular, one is by <hi>filing</hi> it into these Forms, when it is first Punched round; the other by making a <hi>Punch</hi> of Steel, of the Size and Shape of the <hi>Shank</hi> you are to <hi>rivet,</hi> and punching that <hi>Punch</hi> into the Plate, make the same Form.</p>
                        <p>Now to return where I left off. The <hi>Pins</hi> and <hi>Shanks</hi> of these <hi>Wards</hi> must be made of a long Square Form, because, (the Plates of the <hi>Wards</hi> being thin) should you make them no broader than the Plate is thick, the <hi>Studs,</hi> or <hi>Shanks</hi> would be too weak to hold the <hi>Wards,</hi> therefore you must make the <hi>Rivetting-shank</hi> three or four times, or sometimes more, as broad as the Plate is thick, and then <hi>rivet</hi> them in, as you were taught just now.</p>
                        <p>Then place the <hi>Cover-plate</hi> upon the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> so as the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Cover-plate,</hi> may stand directly over and against the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> and make marks through the Hole GG, of the <hi>Studs</hi> of the <hi>Cover-Plate</hi> upon the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> and on those Marks Punch holes, and fit two <hi>Pins</hi> into them, to fasten the <hi>Cover-plate</hi> on to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1212705000:41"/>
the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> but you must not yet <hi>rivet</hi> them down, till the <hi>Key-hole</hi> be made, because this <hi>Cover-plate</hi> would then stop the Progress of the <hi>File</hi> through the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> when you <hi>file</hi> the <hi>Key-hole.</hi> When you have placed the <hi>Cover-plate</hi> upon the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> and fitted it on with <hi>Pins,</hi> so, as you may take it off, and put it on again, as your Work may require, you must <hi>Punch</hi> the <hi>Key-hole,</hi> or rather drill two Holes close by one another, if the <hi>Key-hole</hi> falls near the <hi>Wards,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Punching</hi> may be apt to set the <hi>Wards</hi> out of Form, and with small <hi>Files,</hi> file the two Holes into one another, to make the Hole big enough to come at it with bigger <hi>Files,</hi> and then file your <hi>Key-hole</hi> to your intended Size and Shape.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Key-hole</hi> being finished, forge your <hi>Key,</hi> as you were taught, <hi>Page</hi> 7. and if your <hi>Key</hi> is to have a <hi>Pin-hole,</hi> drill the Hole in the Middle of the End of the <hi>Shank,</hi> then file the <hi>Wards,</hi> or Slits in the <hi>Bit</hi> with thin <hi>Files</hi>; yet sometimes Smiths <hi>Punch,</hi> or cut them with a <hi>Cold-Chissel,</hi> at the same Distances from the Middle of the <hi>Pin-hole</hi> in the End of the <hi>Shank</hi> (which is the same <hi>Centre,</hi> which was made before, in the <hi>Main-plate</hi> on the <hi>Cover-plate</hi>) which you placed the <hi>Wards</hi> at, from the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Main</hi> and <hi>Cover-plate.</hi> But before you file these <hi>Wards</hi> too deep into the <hi>Bit</hi> of the <hi>Key,</hi> make Trials, by putting the <hi>Bit</hi> into the <hi>Key-hole,</hi> whether the <hi>Wards</hi> in the <hi>Bit,</hi> will agree with the <hi>Wards</hi> on the Plates, which if they do, you may boldly cut them to the Depth of the <hi>Wards</hi> on the Plate; if not, you must alter your Course till they do; but you must take great Care in Cutting the <hi>Wards</hi> down straight, and square to the Sides of the <hi>Bit</hi>; for if they be not cut down straight, the <hi>Wards</hi> on the Plates, will not fall in with the <hi>Wards</hi> in the <hi>Bit</hi> of the <hi>Key</hi>; and if they be not Square to the Sides of the <hi>Bit,</hi> the <hi>Bit</hi> will not only be weaker than it need be, but it will

But you must take care that your <hi>Chissel</hi> be neither too thick, or too broad, for this Punching of <hi>Wards</hi> is only to give the thin <hi>Files</hi> Entrance to the Work; which Entrance when you have, you may easily file your <hi>Cross,</hi> or <hi>Hook-wards,</hi> wider or deeper, as your Work may require; but if your <hi>Chissel</hi> be too broad, or too thick, it will make the <hi>Wards</hi> in the <hi>Bit</hi> too long, or too wide, and then (as I said before) the <hi>Bit</hi> of your <hi>Key</hi> will prove weaker than it needs to be.</p>
                        <p>Having made the <hi>Wards</hi> on the Plate, and in the <hi>Bit</hi> of the <hi>Key,</hi> you must <hi>Forge</hi> the <hi>Bolt</hi> of a considerable Substance, Thick and Square at the End that shoots into the <hi>Staple</hi> in the Frame of the Door, that it may be strong enough to guard the whole Door; but the rest of the <hi>Bolt</hi> that lies between the two <hi>Staples</hi> on the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> may be made very thin inwards, that is, the Side that lies towards the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> which because it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be seen when the <hi>Bolt</hi> is fixed upon the Plate, I have made a Figure of it, and turned the Inside to View, as in <hi>Fig.</hi> 4. where you may see, that the End A, hath a considerable Substance of Iron to guard the whole Door, as aforesaid, and B is a Square <hi>Stud,</hi> which doth as well keep the Outside flat of the <hi>Bolt</hi> on the Range, as serve for a <hi>Stud</hi> for the <hi>Spring</hi> H in <hi>Fig.</hi> 2. to press hard against, and shoot the <hi>Bolt</hi> forwards: This <hi>Bolt</hi> must be wrought straight on all its Sides, except the Topside, which must be wrought straight only as far as the <hi>Sholder</hi> G, called the <hi>Toe,</hi> or <hi>Nab</hi> of the <hi>Bolt,</hi> which rises, as you see in the Figure, considerably high, above the Straight on the Top of the <hi>Bolt</hi>; The Office of this <hi>Nab,</hi>

                        <p>Having <hi>forged</hi> and <hi>filed</hi> the <hi>Bolt,</hi> you must fit the Hollow-side of it towards the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> at that Distance from the <hi>Key-hole,</hi> that when the <hi>Key</hi> is put into the <hi>Key-hole,</hi> and turned towards the <hi>Bolt,</hi> the Bottom of the <hi>Bit</hi> may fall almost to the Bottom of the <hi>Nab,</hi> and shoot the <hi>Bolt</hi> back so much, as it needs to enter the <hi>Staple</hi> in the <hi>Door-frame.</hi> And having found this true Place for the <hi>Bolt,</hi> you must with square <hi>Staples,</hi> just fit to contain the <hi>Bolt</hi> with an easie Play, fasten these <hi>Staples,</hi> by <hi>Rivetting</hi> them with the <hi>Bolt</hi> within them, one near the <hi>Bolt</hi> end, the other near the <hi>Nab</hi> end, as at LL to the <hi>Main-plate.</hi>

This small Line is only for a guide to cut the <hi>Groove</hi> down by; for the making of a <hi>Screw</hi> is, indeed nothing else, but the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Groove</hi> down, for then the <hi>Worm</hi> remains: But you must not <hi>file</hi> in this small line, but leave it as a guide to lie on the middle of the <hi>Worm</hi> (as I said before): Therefore to cut down the <hi>Groove,</hi> take a <hi>Cold-Chissel,</hi> somewhat thinner than you intend the <hi>Groove</hi> shall be wide, <hi>viz.</hi> about
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1212705000:50"/>
the thickness of the breadth of the <hi>Worm,</hi> and, with heavy blows, cut out the <hi>Groove</hi> pretty near. The reason why you should not offer to cut the <hi>Grooves</hi> to their full wedth at the first, is, because your Hand may carry the <hi>Cold-Chissel</hi> somewhat awry, and should your <hi>Cold-Chissel</hi> be as thick as the <hi>Groove</hi> is wide, you could not smooth the Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities out, without making the <hi>Worm</hi> nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower than you intended it: Then with a <hi>Flat-file</hi> open and smooth the <hi>Groove, filing</hi> in the middle between the two next fine Lines cut by the <hi>half-round File,</hi> till you have wrought the <hi>Spindle</hi> from end to end, so shall the <hi>Worm</hi> remain. But you must not expect, that though the <hi>Groove</hi> be cut, it is therefore finished, for now you must begin to use the thin <hi>Plate-Gage,</hi> and try first, whether the <hi>Worm</hi> have equal breadth all the way. Secondly, whether the <hi>Grove</hi> have equal breadth all the way. And Thirdly, whether the <hi>Groove</hi> have equal depth all the way; and where ever you find the <hi>Worm</hi> too broad, you must <hi>file</hi> it thinner, and where the <hi>Groove</hi> is not deep enough, <hi>file</hi> it deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; therefore in cutting down the <hi>Groove</hi> you may observe, that if, at first, you <hi>file</hi> the <hi>Worm</hi> never so little too narrow or the <hi>Groove</hi> never so little too deep, you shall have all the rest of the <hi>Worm</hi> or <hi>Groove</hi> to <hi>file</hi> over again; because the whole <hi>Worm</hi> must be brought to the breadth of the smallest part of it, and the whole <hi>Groove</hi> to the depth of the deepest place all the way, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the <hi>Nut</hi> be to be <hi>Cast</hi> in <hi>Brass</hi> upon the <hi>Spindle</hi>; because the Mettal running close to the <hi>Spindle</hi> will bind on that place, and not come off it; but if the <hi>Nut</hi> be not to be <hi>Cast</hi> in <hi>Brass,</hi> but only hath a <hi>Worm</hi> brazed into it, this niceness is not so absolutely necessary, because that <hi>Worm</hi> is first <hi>Turned up,</hi> and bowed into the <hi>Grooves</hi> of the <hi>Spindle,</hi> and you may try that before it is

                           <hi>Braz'd</hi> in the <hi>Nut,</hi> and if it go not well about, you may mend, or botch it, either by <hi>Hammering</hi> or <hi>Filing,</hi> or both.</p>

                        <p>If your <hi>Spindle</hi> is to have three or four <hi>Worms</hi> winding about it, as <hi>Coining-Presses</hi> and <hi>Printing-Presses</hi> have, that they may not wear out too fast, you must divide the Circumference into three or four equal Parts, and having straight upright Lines, drawn as before, begin a <hi>Worm</hi> at each of those three, or four Divisions, on the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and considering the breadth of your <hi>Worm</hi> and width of your <hi>Groove,</hi> measure that width as oft as you can on all the upright Lines, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Marks on those at each Setting off, draw as before, a Line from the end of the <hi>Spindle,</hi> on the first upright Line to the Mark below it, which is the second Mark on the second upright Line, from thence to the third Mark, on the third up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Line, and so on to the other end of the <hi>Spindle.</hi> Having drawn the first <hi>Worm,</hi> work the other <hi>Worm</hi> as this.</p>

thus. If your Work, as in this Case, be an <hi>Outer-square,</hi> you must use the <hi>Inner-square,</hi> DEF to try it by; applying either the side ED or DF (but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the side ED) to one of the sides of your Work, chuse the flattest and truest wrought; if neither of the sides be flat, make of them flat, as you were taught <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol.</hi> 15, 16. if then you find the side DF of your <hi>Square</hi> lie all the way even upon the adjoining side of your Work, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude those sides are Square; but if the adjoining side of your Work comply not all the way with the adjoining side of the <hi>Square,</hi> you must file a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way your Work where the <hi>Square</hi> rides upon it, till the whole side be wrought to comply with
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1212705000:55"/>
the adjoining side of the <hi>Square,</hi> that is, till both the sides of your Work agree with both the sides of the <hi>Squares,</hi> when they are appli'd to one another. Having tried two sides Square, make a third side of your Work Square, by applying one of the sides of the <hi>Square</hi> to one of those sides of your Work, that are already made square, and as before, try the third untry'd side, and make that Square; and by the same Rule make the fourth side square.</p>
                     <p>If the Work you are to file be an hollow square, you must apply the outer Square ABC to it, and try how, when one side of the <hi>Square,</hi> is applied to one side of your Work, the other side of your Work agrees with the other side of the <hi>Square</hi>; which if it do, all is well: But if the <hi>Square</hi> and the Work comply not with one another, you must file the Work where it bears the <hi>Square</hi> off. But to return where I left.</p>
                     <p>Having made these two ends square, you must fit the length of them to the thickness of the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides</hi> into which they are to enter, but so as the Squares be not full so long as to come quite thro' the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides,</hi> lest when the <hi>Nuts</hi> are screw'd on the <hi>Screw-pins</hi> that are at the ends of these Squares, they screw full up to the Squares, and bear against the corners of them; which if they do, the <hi>Nuts</hi> will not draw the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides</hi> close against the shoulder of the Squares, on the <hi>top</hi> and <hi>bottom Pieces,</hi> and then the whole <hi>Jack Frame</hi> will not stand fast and firm together.</p>
                     <p>But before you fit this <hi>Frame</hi> thus together, you must consider the Diameter of the <hi>Main-wheel,</hi> that you may Punch round Holes in the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides</hi> to enter the <hi>Main-spindle.</hi> Therefore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen your Compass to half the intended Diameter of the <hi>Main-wheel,</hi> and half a quarter, or an whole quarter of an Inch more for play, between
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1212705000:56"/>
the Semi-diameter of the <hi>main Wheel,</hi> and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per flat of the <hi>bottom Piece,</hi> and set that distance off from the upper flat of the <hi>bottom Piece,</hi> on the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides,</hi> and with a round Punch, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what smaller than the intended size of the <hi>main Spindle,</hi> Punch Holes at that setting off. Your Punch must be smaller than the <hi>main Spindle,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the holes may perhaps not be so exactly round, or Punch'd so truly upright, or perfectly smooth as they ought to be; and should you make the holes so wide at first as they need to be, you could not mend them, without making them wider. These holes must be Punch'd at the <hi>Fire</hi> or <hi>Forge</hi> (as Smiths say, when they take an <hi>Heat</hi> of their Work to Punch it) because the <hi>Fore</hi> and the <hi>Backsides</hi> are <hi>too strong</hi> (as Smiths say) that is, too thick to Punch with the <hi>Cold Punch.</hi> The way of Punching them you were taught <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol.</hi> 11, 12. Besides a <hi>Cold Punch</hi> is commonly made flat at the bottom, and therefore does not prick an Hole, but cut an Hole (if the Iron be not too strong) for that flat bottom, and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right side about it, met in an Angle or Edge at the bottom, which Edge, by the force of the Hammer, cuts the Iron (if it be not too strong) when it is laid upon a <hi>Bolster,</hi> as it is describ'd <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol.</hi> 12. and should you cut out so much Iron in the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides,</hi> as would entertain the <hi>main Spindle</hi> (it being thick) you will make the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides</hi> too wide; therefore as I said, the Holes must be prickt in the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides</hi> at the <hi>Fire</hi> or <hi>Forge,</hi> which with a sharp pointed <hi>Punch</hi> is sooner done; nor does pricking diminish the substance or strength of the Iron, but makes it swell out at the sides, and retain both substance and strength. The irregularity or swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out that this Punching makes on the flats of the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides,</hi> you must Hammer down
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1212705000:57"/>
again with almost a <hi>Blood-red-heat,</hi> I say, almost a <hi>Blood-red-heat</hi>; because, should you take too great an <hi>Heat,</hi> you may make the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides</hi> stretch, and so put the whole <hi>Jack-frame</hi> out of order.</p>
                     <p>Having punch'd the Holes for the <hi>main Spindle,</hi> you must Punch the Holes in the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides</hi> for the <hi>Worm-wheel Spindle,</hi> as you Punch the Holes for the <hi>main Spindle</hi>; but these must be small Holes, to entertain the small Ends or Pins of the <hi>Worm-wheel Spindle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These Holes thus Punch'd, may perhaps not be exactly round or fit your size, nor will they be smooth enough within; therefore, with a <note n="a" place="bottom">The <hi>square Bore,</hi> is a square Steel Point or Shank well Temper'd, fitted into a square Socket in an Iron <hi>Wimble</hi>: It is describ'd, <hi>Fig.</hi> 3. Its use is to open a Hole and make it truly round and smooth within; when you use it, you must set the Head against your Breast, and put the Point of the <hi>square Bore</hi> into the Hole you punch'd or would open, and turning the Handle about, you with it turn about the Shank of the <hi>square Bore,</hi> whose Edges cut away the Irregularities of the Iron made in the Punching. But you must thrust or lean hard with your Breast against the Head of the <hi>square Bore,</hi> that it may cut the faster: And you must be sure to guide the <hi>square Bore</hi> truly straight forwards in the Hole, lest the Hole be wrought aslope in the Iron.</note> 
                        <hi>Square-bore,</hi> you must <note n="b" place="bottom">To <hi>open an Hole,</hi> is in Smith's Language, to make the Hole wider.</note> open them wider to your size, and that opening them in the inside, will both round <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>You must also Punch a square hole towards the top of the <hi>Foreside,</hi> for the <hi>Shank</hi> of the <hi>Worm-Loop.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then Forge and sit in your <hi>Main-wheel Spindle,</hi> and your <hi>Worm-wheel Spindle,</hi> which Spindles must both be exactly straight between the corners of their two ends (unless you like to have Moldings for Ornaments on them) and Forge a Square to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ends of both the Spindles, to fit into a square hole in the middle of the <hi>Cross</hi> of their <hi>Wheels,</hi> and leave substance enough for a shoulder beyond the square, to stop the square hole in the <hi>Cross</hi> of the <hi>Wheels</hi> from sliding farther on the <hi>Spindle,</hi> and you must leave substance of Iron e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Forge the <hi>Nut</hi> of the <hi>Worm-wheel</hi> near the other end. But in this, and indeed in all other Forging remember (as I told you <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol.</hi> 9) that it behoves you to <hi>Hammer</hi> or <hi>Forge</hi> your Work as true as you can, least it cost you great pains at the <hi>Vice.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:1212705000:58"/>Then Forge the <hi>Worm-spindle,</hi> which is all the way round and straight, unless you will have Moldings for Ornaments (as aforesaid) upon the <hi>Shank</hi> of it: But you must be sure to Forge substance enough for the <hi>Worm</hi> to be cut out of it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Main</hi> and <hi>Worm-wheels</hi> are Forg'd round and flat.</p>
                     <p>The manner of Forging these Wheels (which in Smith's Language is, <hi>Turning up the Wheels</hi>) is, first, to draw out a square Rod (as you were taught <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol.</hi> 9. among the several <hi>Heats of Iron</hi>) somewhat thicker than you intend your <hi>Wheel</hi> shall be; but it must be almost as thin on one side, as you intend the inner edge of the <hi>Wheel</hi> shall be, and the opposite to it above twice that thickness, for the outer edge of the <hi>Wheel</hi>: the reason you will find by and by. Having drawn from your square Rod a convenient length, <hi>viz.</hi> almost three times the Diameter of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Wheel, you must take almost a <hi>Flame-heat,</hi> and Hammer all along the whole length up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the thick edge, so will you find the long Rod by this Hammering, turn by degrees rounder and rounder in, upon the thin edge, which you Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer'd not upon, till it become a Circle, or pretty near a Circle. But you must make it somewhat more than a Circle, for the ends must lap over one another, that they may be <hi>welded</hi> upon one another.</p>
                     <p>Thus you may see the Reason for making the outer edge of the Rod thick, and the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Edge thin; for your Hammering upon the outer edge only, and not on the inner, makes the outer edge a great deal thinner, and at the same time makes the Wheel broader.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:1212705000:59"/>The Reason why I told you, you should draw fourth the Rod to almost three times the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the Wheel, and not to the Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical proportion; is, because that in Hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it to make it round, the Rod will stretch so considerably, that it will be long enough to make a <hi>Wheel</hi> of your intended Diameter, and most commonly somewhat to spare. But to return.</p>
                     <p>Before you take a <hi>welding Heat,</hi> as by <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol.</hi> 9, 10. you must flatten the two ends that are to be <hi>welded</hi> together, to a little more than half their thickness, that when they are lapt over one another, and <hi>welded</hi> together, they may be no thicker than the other part of the <hi>Wheel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Wheel</hi> be not <hi>turned up</hi> so round, that with a little labour you may mend them at the <hi>Vice</hi>; you must with <hi>Blood red Heats</hi> Hammer them round upon the <hi>Pike</hi> or <hi>Bickern</hi> of the <hi>Anvel,</hi> holding with your <hi>Tongs</hi> the inner edge of the <hi>Wheel</hi> upon it, and Hammering upon the outer edge of the <hi>Wheel,</hi> till the <hi>Wheel</hi> be fit for the <hi>Vice</hi>: Their insides must be divided into four equal Parts or four <note n="c" place="bottom">A <hi>Dufftail,</hi> is a Figure made in the form of a Doves-tail, and is us'd by many other Handy-crafts, as well as Smiths, but most especially by Joyners, as I shall shew, when I come to <hi>Joynery.</hi>

one end with an hole in it; but the Handle is not to hold it by when you use it, but the hole in it to go over a pin you hang it upon, when you do not use it. When you use it, you must lay it flat upon the Work bench, with its Handle, from you, and you must take care that it lies so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and steady, lest when you Work upon it, it slip from you; therefore you may strike a Nail in at the hole in the Handle, a little way into the Work bench, that you may draw it again, when you have done with the <hi>using File,</hi> you may drive in a small Tack on each side the <hi>using File,</hi> to keep it steddy or you may Tack down two small thin boards on either side and rip them off again when you have done.

                     <head>Of several sorts of Steel in common use among Smiths.</head>
                     <p>THE difficulty of getting good Steel makes many Workmen (when by good hap they light on it) commend that Country-Steel for best, from whence that Steel came. Thus I have found some cry up <hi>Flemish-steel,</hi> others <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish, English, Spanish, Venice,</hi> &amp;c. But according to my Observation and common Consent of the most ingenious Workmen, each Country pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces almost indifferently good and bad; yet each Country doth not equally produce such Steel, as is fit for every particular purpose, as I shall shew you by and by. But the several sorts of Steel, that are in general use here in <hi>England,</hi> are the <hi>English,</hi> the <hi>Flemish,</hi> the <hi>Swedish,</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> and the <hi>Venice-steel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>English-steel</hi> is made in several places in <hi>England,</hi> as in <hi>Yorkshire, Gloucestershire, Sussex,</hi> the <hi>Wild of Kent,</hi> &amp;c. But the best is made about the <hi>Forrest of Dean,</hi> it breaks Fiery, with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a course Grain But if it be well wrought and proves sound, it makes good Edge-tools, Files and Punches. It will work well at the Forge, and take a good Heat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:1212705000:72"/>The <hi>Flemish-steel</hi> is made in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Stiermark</hi> and in the <hi>Land of Luyck</hi>: From thence brought to <hi>Colen,</hi> and is brought down the River <hi>Rhine</hi> to <hi>Dort,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> some in <hi>Bars</hi> and some in <hi>Gads,</hi> and is therefore by us call'd <hi>Flemish-steel,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Gad-steel.</hi> It is a tough sort of Steel, and the only Steel us'd for Watch-springs. It is also good for Punches; File-cutters also use it to make their Chissels of, with which they cut their Files. It breaks with a fine Grain, works well at the Forge, and will take a weld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heat.</p>
                     <p>I cannot learn that any Steel comes from <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> but from <hi>Dantzick</hi> comes some which is call'd <hi>Swedish-steel</hi>: It is much of the same Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Finess with <hi>Flemish-steel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spanish-steel</hi> is made about <hi>Biscay.</hi> It is a fine sort of Steel, but some of it is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to work at the Forge, because it will not take a good Heat; and it sometimes proves very unsound, as not being well <hi>curried,</hi> that is well wrought. It is too quick (as Workmen call it) that is, too brittle for Springs or Punches, but makes good fine Edg'd-tools.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Venice-steel</hi> is much like <hi>Spanish steel,</hi> but much finer, and Works somewhat better at the Forge. It is us'd for Razors, Chirurgion's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, Gravers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Because it will come to a fine and thin Edge. Razor makers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally clap a small Bar of <hi>Venice-steel</hi> between two small Bars of <hi>Flemish-steel,</hi> and so Work or Weld them together, to strengthen the back of the Razor, and keep it from crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</p>

                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:1212705000:73"/>There is another sort of Steel, of higher com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations than any of the forgoing sorts: It is call'd <hi>Damascus-steel;</hi> 'tis very rare that any comes into <hi>England</hi> unwrought, but the <hi>Turkish-Cymeters</hi> are generally made of it.

                     <p>HAving chose your Steel and forg'd it to your intended shape, if you are either to File Engrave or to Punch upon it, you ought to Neal it first, because it will make it softer and consequently work easier. The common way is to give it a <hi>Blood-red-heat</hi> in the Fire, then take it out, and let it cool of it self.</p>
                     <p>There are some pretenders to know how to make Steel as soft as Lead; but so oft as my Curiosity has prompted me to try their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Processes, so oft have they fail'd me; and not only me, but some others, careful Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. But the way they most boast of, is the often heating the Iron or Steel in red-hot Lead, and letting it cool of it self with the Lead. I have many times try'd this without any other success, than that it does make Iron or Steel as soft as if it were well Neal'd the common way, but no softer: And could it be otherwise, the small Iron Ladles, that Letter-founders use to the casting of Printing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If your Steel be too hard, that is to brittle, and it be an edg'd or pointed Instrument you make, the edge or point will be very subject to break; or if it be a Spring, it will not bow, but with the least bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it will snap assunder: Therefore you must <hi>let it down</hi> (as Smiths say) that is, make it softer, by <hi>tempering</hi> it. The manner is thus, take a piece of Grin-stone or Whet-stone and rub hard upon your Work to take the black Scurf off it, and brighten it; then let it heat in the Fire, and as it grows hotter you will see the Colour change by degrees, coming to a light goldish Colour, then to a dark goldish Colour, and at last to a blew Colour; choose which of these Colours your Work requires, and then quench it suddenly in Water. The light goldish Colour is for Files, Cold-chissels and Punches, that Punch into Iron and Steel: The dark goldish Colour for Punches to use on Brass, and generally for most Edge-tools: The blew Colour gives the Temper to Springs in general, and is also us'd to Beautifie both Iron and Steel; but then Workmen some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

                     </p>
                     <p>But if you ask me how <hi>rank</hi> your <hi>Iron</hi> ought to be set? I answer, If your Wood be <hi>soft,</hi> and your <hi>Stuff free,</hi> and <hi>frowy,</hi> that is, evenly temper'd all the way, you may <hi>set</hi> the <hi>Iron</hi> to take a shaving off the thickness of an old coined Shilling, but scarce thicker; whereas, if your <hi>Stuff</hi> be <hi>hard,</hi> or <hi>curling,</hi> or <hi>knotty,</hi> you shall scarce be able to take a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving off the thickness of an old Groat. Therefore you must examine the Temper of your <hi>Stuff,</hi> by easy Trials, how the <hi>Plane</hi> will work upon it, and <hi>set</hi> your <hi>Iron</hi> accordingly. And observe this as a General Rule, that the <hi>Iron</hi> of the <hi>Fore-Plane</hi> is, for the first working with it, to be <hi>set</hi> as <hi>rank</hi> as you can make good work with; and that for speed sake.</p>
                     <p>If your <hi>Iron</hi> be <hi>set</hi> too <hi>rank,</hi> knock with an <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> upon the <hi>Britch</hi> of the <hi>Stock,</hi> and afterwards upon the <hi>Wedge</hi>; for this knocking upon the <hi>Britch,</hi> if you knock hard enough, 'twill raise the <hi>Iron</hi> a little, and <hi>set</hi> it <hi>fine</hi>; if you knock not hard enough, you must knock again, till the <hi>Iron</hi> do rise; but if you knock too hard, it will raise the <hi>Iron</hi> so much, that its edge will rise above the <hi>Sole</hi> into the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the <hi>Stock,</hi> and consequently not touch the <hi>Stuff</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore you must knock softly at first, till, by trials, you find the <hi>Iron</hi> rises to a convenient <hi>fineness.</hi> But as this knocking on the <hi>Britch</hi> raises the <hi>Iron,</hi> so it also raises and loosens the <hi>Wedge</hi>; therefore (as aforesaid) whenever
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1212705000:83"/>
you knock upon the <hi>Britch,</hi> you must also knock upon the <hi>Wedge,</hi> to soften the <hi>Iron</hi> again.</p>
                     <p>If you have raised the edge of the <hi>Iron</hi> too <hi>fine,</hi> you must knock softly upon the head of the <hi>Iron,</hi> and then again upon the <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

through the Mortesses in the <hi>Stock,</hi> till the <hi>Fence</hi> stands half an Inch off the Iron-Plate; and if the <hi>Staves</hi> are fitted stiff enough in the Mortess of the <hi>Stock,</hi> it will keep at that Distance whilst you Plow the <hi>Groove</hi>: For the <hi>Fence</hi> (lying low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the <hi>Iron</hi> of the <hi>Plane</hi>) when you set the <hi>Iron</hi> of the <hi>Plow</hi> upon the edge of the Board, will lie flat against the farther edge of the Board, and so keep the <hi>Iron</hi> of the <hi>Plow</hi> all the length of the Board at the same Distance, from the edge of the Board that the <hi>Iron</hi> of the <hi>Plow</hi> hath from the <hi>Fence.</hi> Therefore your <hi>Plow</hi> being thus fitted, plow the <hi>Groove</hi> as you work with other <hi>Planes,</hi> only as you laid hold on the <hi>Stock</hi> of other <hi>Planes</hi> when you use them, now you must lay hold of the two <hi>staves</hi> and their <hi>shoulders,</hi> and so thrust your Plow forwards, till your <hi>Groove</hi> be made to your depth.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Staves</hi> go not stiff enough in the Mortess of the Stock, you must stiffen them, by knocking a little wooden Wedge between the Staves and their Mortesses.</p>

                     <p>THere are several other <hi>Planes</hi> in use amongst Joyners, called <hi>Molding-planes</hi>; as, the <hi>Round,</hi> the <hi>Hollow,</hi> the <hi>Ogee,</hi> the <hi>Snipes-bill,</hi> the <hi>Rabbet-plane,</hi> the <hi>Grooving-plane,</hi> &amp;c. And of these they have several sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> from half a quarter of an Inch, to an Inch and a half. They are used as other <hi>Planes</hi> are. In the Planeing of Stuff, you must use <hi>Planes</hi> whose <hi>Irons</hi> have different Mountings; and that according to the hardness, or softness of the Wood, you are to work upon: For if the Wood be hard, the <hi>Iron</hi> must stand more upright than it need do, if the Wood be soft: For soft Wood, as <hi>Deal, Pear-tree, Maple,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Iron</hi> is set to make an Angle of 45 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1212705000:90"/>
with the <hi>Sole</hi> of the <hi>Plane</hi>: But if it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard Wood you are to Plane upon, as <hi>Box, Ebony, Lignum Vitae,</hi> &amp;c. It is set to 80 Degrees, and sometimes quite upright: So that these hard Woods, are, indeed, more properly said to be Scraped, than Planed.</p>
                     <p>But before you come to use your <hi>Planes,</hi> you must know how to grind, and whet them, for they are not so fitted when they are bought, but every Workman accomodates them to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as if it be an hard Wood he is to work on, he grinds his <hi>Basil</hi> to a more obtuse Angle, than he would do for soft Wood.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Basil,</hi> or Angle, an Iron is ground to, to work on soft Wood is about 12 Degrees, and for hard Wood about 18, or 20 Degrees. Where note, That the more acute, or thinner the <hi>Basil</hi> is, the better and smoother the <hi>Iron</hi> cuts; and the more obtuse and thicker, the stronger the Edge is to work upon hard Work.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>WHen you grind your <hi>Iron,</hi> place your two Thumbs under the <hi>Iron,</hi> and your Fingers of both Hands upon the <hi>Iron,</hi> and so clap down your <hi>Iron</hi> to the Stone, holding it to that Angle with the Stone you intend the <hi>Basil</hi> shall have: Keep the <hi>Iron</hi> in this Posture, without either mounting, or sinking its ends all the while the <hi>Stone</hi> is turning about; and when you lift the <hi>Iron</hi> off the <hi>Stone,</hi> to see if it be ground to your Mind; if it be not, you must be sure you place the <hi>Iron</hi> again in the same Position on the <hi>Stone</hi> it had before; for else you will make a double <hi>Basil</hi> on your <hi>Iron</hi>: But if it be true set on the <hi>Stone,</hi> and steddily kept to that Position, your <hi>Basil</hi> will be <hi>Hollow,</hi> and the smaller your <hi>Grind-stone</hi>

                     <p>Having ground your <hi>Iron,</hi> you must smoothen the edge finer with a good <hi>Whet-stone.</hi> Thus, hold the edge of your <hi>Iron</hi> upward in your left Hand, and your <hi>

                     <p>Joiners often grind their <hi>Irons</hi> upon a flat <hi>Grind-stone</hi> also: And then they hold the <hi>Iron</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in their Hands, in the same Posture as if it were to be ground on the <hi>Round Grind-stone</hi>: Yet then instead of keeping the <hi>Iron</hi> on one place of the <hi>Stone,</hi> they thrust it hard straight forwards, almost the length of the <hi>Stone,</hi> and draw it lightlier straight back again, keeping it all the while at the same Angle with the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the <hi>Stone</hi>; and then smoothen its edge with the <hi>Whet-stone,</hi> as if it had been ground upon the round <hi>Grind-stone.</hi> And this they do so often, till they have rubbed the hollowness of the <hi>Basil</hi> to a flat, and then they grind it again upon the round <hi>Grind-stone.</hi>

                        <hi>§. 15:</hi> Of the <hi>Square,</hi> and its Vse.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Square,</hi> marked D, is two adjunct Sides of a Geometrical Square. <hi>a</hi> The <hi>Handle. b</hi> The <hi>Tongue. c</hi> The <hi>Outer Square. d</hi> The <hi>Inner Square.</hi> For Joiner's use, it is made of two pieces of Wood, the one about an Inch thick, and the other about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Inch thick: These two pieces are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally shot exactly straight, and have each of their Sides parallel to each of their own Sides. The thick Piece (called the Handle) hath a Mortess in it, as long within a quarter of an Inch, as the thin piece (called the Tongue) is broad, and stifly so wide, as to contain the thickness of the Tongue. The Tongue is fastned into the Mortess of the Handle with Glew and wooden Pins, so as the two outer sides (and then consequently the two inner sides) may stand at right Angles with one another.</p>
                     <p>The Reason why the Handle is so much thicker than the Tongue, is, because the Handle should on either side become a Fence to the Tongue.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1212705000:97"/>
And the reason why the Tongue hath not its whole breadth let into the end of the Handle is, because they may with less care strike a line by the side of a thin than a thick piece: For if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of holding the Hand upright when they strike a Line, they should hold it never so little inwards, the shank of a Pricker falling against the top edge of the Handle, would throw the Point of a Pricker farther out than a thin Piece would: To avoid which Inconvenience, the Tongue is left about half an Inch out of the end of the Handle.</p>
                     <p>Another Reason is. That if with often striking the Pricker against the Tongue it becomes rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or uneven, they can with less trouble Plane it again when the Stuff is all the way of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual strength, than they can, if Cross grain'd Shoulders be added to any part of it.</p>
                     <p>Its use is for the striking of Lines square ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to other Lines, or to straight sides, and to try the squareness of their Work by; As if they would strike a Line square to a side they have already shot: They apply the inside of the Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle close to the side shot, and lay the Tongue flat upon the Work, than by the outerside of the Tongue, they draw with a Pricker a straight Line: This is called <hi>Striking, or drawing of a Square.</hi> Or, if they would Try the squareness of a Piece of Stuff shot on two adjoining sides, they apply the insides of the Handle and Tongue to the outsides of the Stuff, and if the outsides of the Stuff do all the way agree in Line with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides of the Square, it is true Square. Or if they would try the inward squareness of Work, they apply the two outsides of the Square to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides of the Work.</p>

                        <hi>§. 16.</hi> The manner of <hi>Plaining</hi> and <hi>Trying</hi> a piece of Stuff-square.</head>
                     <p>WE will take, for Example, a Piece of Stuff called a Quarter, which is commonly two Inches thick, four Inches broad, and seven Foot long. To plane this Square, lay one of its broad Sides upon the Bench, with one of its ends shov'd pretty hard into the Teeth of the Bench-hook, that it may lie the steddier. Then with the Fore-Plane, as you were taught, § 2. <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. Plane off the roughness the Saw made at the Pit, and work that side of the Quarter as streight in its length and breadth as you can with the Fore-Plane; which you may give a pretty good guess at, if the edge of the Iron have born all the way upon the Work. yet you may try by taking up your Work, and applying one end of it to one Eye, whilst you wink with the other, and observe if any Hollow, or Dawks be in the length; if not, you may conclude it pretty true: For the Work thus held, the Eye will discern pretty near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Or, for more certainty, you may apply the edge of the two-foot Rule, or rather a Rule shot the full length of the Quarter to your Work, and if it agree all the way with the Rule, you may conclude it is straight in length. But if you find it not straight, you must still with the Fore-Plane work off those Risings that bear the edge of the Rule off any part of the Stuff: Then try if the Breadth be pretty straight; if it be, (the Dawks the roughness the Fore-plane made excepted) the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Rank, and therefore makes great Dawks in the Stuff, you must set the Iron of your Fore-plane finer, as you were taught, §. 3. <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. and with it then work down even almost to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of those Dawks: then try it again, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and if you find it try all the way, you may, with the Jointer, or Smoothing-plane, but rather with the Jointer, go over it again, to work out the irregularities of the fine Fore plane: For the Iron of the Fore-plane being ground to a Rising in the middle, as has been shew'd, §. 2. <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. though it be very fine set, will yet leave some Dawks in the Stuff for the Jointer, or Smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-plane, to work out. Thus the first side of the Quarter will be finished.</p>
                     <p>Having thus tryed one side of the Quarter straight and flat, apply the inside of the Handle to it, and if one of the adjoining sides of the Quarter, comply also with the inside of the Tongue all the way, you need only smooth that adjoining side: But if it do not so comply, that is, if it be not square to the first side, which you will know by the riding of the inside of the Tongue upon one of the Edges; or some other part between the Edges, you must, with the Fore-plane Rank-set, plain away that Stuff which bears off the inside of the Tongue from complying all the way with it. But if the Risings be great, you may, for quickness, hew away the Risings with the Hatchet: but then you must have a care you let not the edge of your Hatchet cut too deep into the Stuff, lest you either spoil your Stuff, by making it unsizeable, if it be already small enough; or if it have substance enough, make your self more labour to get out those Hatchet-stroaks with the Plane than you need. Then take off the roughness the Hatchet made with the Fore-plane Rank-set, then fine set, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1212705000:100"/>
last of all with the Jointer, or Smoothing-plane: So is the second side also finished.</p>
                     <p>To work the third side, set the Oval of the Gage exactly to that width from the Gage, that you intend the Breadth of the Quarter (when wrought) shall have, which, in this our Example, is four Inches, but will be somewhat less, because working it true will diminish the Stuff: Therefore sliding the Oval on the Staff, measure on your Inch-Rule so much less than four Inches, as you think your Stuff diminishes in working: Measure, I say, between the Oval and the Tooth, your size: If, at the first proffer, your Oval stand too far from the Tooth, hold the Oval in your Hand, and knock the Tooth-end of your Staff upon the Work-bench, till it stand near enough: If the Oval stand too near, knock the other end of the Staff upon the Work-bench till it be fit. Then apply the flat of the Oval to the second wrought side of your Stuff, so as the Tooth may reach athwart the breadth of the Stuff upon the first side, and keeping the Oval close against the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond side, press the Tooth so hard down, that by drawing the Gage in this posture all along the length of the Quarter, the Tooth may strike a Line. In like manner upon the side opposite to the first, <hi>viz.</hi> the fourth side, Gage another line opposite to the first gaged Line, and work your Stuff down to those two gaged Lines on the third side, either with Plaining along, or with Hewing, and afterwards Plaining, as you were taught to work the second side.</p>
                     <p>To work the fourth side, set the Tooth of the Gage to its exact distance from the Oval, <hi>viz.</hi> two Inches wanting so much as you think the Stuff di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish'd in working, and apply the flat of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val to each side of the first side, and Gage as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore two Lines, one on the second, the other on
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1212705000:101"/>
the third wrought side. Work your Stuff then down on the fourth side to those two Gage lines, either with Plaining alone, or with Hewing, and afterwards Plaining, as you were taught to work the second side</p>

                     <p>YOU must take care in Mortessing and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, that as near as you can equallize the strength of the sides of the Mortess to the strength of the Tenant. I do not mean that the Stuff should be of an equal Substance, for that is not equalling strength: But the equalling strength must be considered with respect to the Quality, Position and Substance of the Stuff: As if you were to make a Tennant upon a piece of Fur, and a Mortess to recieve it in a piece of Oak, and the Fur and Oak have both the same size: The Tennant therefore made upon this piece of Fur, must be considerably bigger than a Tennant need be made of Oak, because Fur is much a weaker Wood than Oak, and therefore ought to have greater Substance to equallize the strength of Oak. And for Position, the shorter the Stuff that the Tennant is made on, the less Violence the Ten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nant is subject to. Besides, it is easier to split Wood with the Grain, than to break Wood cros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the Grain; and therefore the same Wood when posited as a Tennant, is stronger than the same Wood of the same size when posited as a Mortess: for the injury a Mortess is subject to, is spliting with the grain of the Wood, which, without good care, it will often do in working; but the force that must injure a Tennant, must offend it, cross the Grain of the Wood, in which Position it will best indure Violence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:1212705000:102"/>When two pieces of Wood, of the same qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and substance (as in this our Example) are elected to make on the one a Tennant, and in the other a Mortess. If you make the Mortess too wide, the sides of the Mortess will be weaker than the sides that contain the Mortess: And if one be weaker than the other, the weakest will give way to the strongest when an equal Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is offer'd to both. Therefore you may see a necessity of equallizing the strength of one to the other, as near as you can. But because no Rule is extant to do it by, nor can (for many Considerations, I think,) be made, therefore this equallizing of strength must be referred to the Judgment of the Operator. Now to the Work.</p>
                     <p>The Mortess to be made is in a Quarter four Inches broad. In this case Workmen make the Mortess an Inch wide, so that an Inch and an half Stuff remains on either side it. Therefore your Stuff being squar'd, as was taught in the last Section, set the Oval of the Gage an Inch and an half off the Tooth, and gage with it, on either side your Stuff, a straight line at that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the end you intend the Mortess shall be, then open your Compasses to two Inches, and prick off that distance in one of the Lines, for the length of the Mortess; then lay the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the Handle of the Square to one side of the Stuff, and upon both the pricks successively, and with your Pricker draw straight Lines through them by the side of the Tongue, so shall the bounds of your Mortess be struck out on the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If your Mortess go through the Quarter, draw the same Lines on the opposite side of the Quarter thus, Turn the Quarter, or it. Edge, and apply the inside of the Handle of the Square, to the ends of the former drawn Lines, and by
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1212705000:103"/>
the side of the Tongue draw two Lines on the edge of the Quarter; then turn the Quarter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with its other broad side upwards, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the inside of the Handle of the Square to the ends of the last Lines drawn on the edge, and by the side of the Tongue, draw two Lines on this broad side also. These two Lines (if your Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was truly squar'd) shall be exactly opposite to the two Lines drawn on the first broad side of the Quarter for the length of the Mortess: And for the width of the Mortess gage this side also, as you did the first; then for the Tennant, gage on that end of the Quarter you intend the Tennant shall be made, the same Lines you did for the Mortess. And because the Quarter is two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thick, prick from the end two Inches, and applying the inside of the Handle of the Square to the side of the Quarter, and the Tongue to that Prick, draw by the side of the Tongue a Line through that side the Quarter; then turn the other sides of the Quarter successively, and draw Lines athwart each side the Quarter, as you were taught to draw the opposite Lines for the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress.</p>
                     <p>Then place the edge of the Inch-Mortess-Chis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel with its Basil from you, and the Helve bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little towards you, within one half quarter of an Inch of one end of the struck Mortess, and with your Mallet knock hard upon it, till you find the Basil of the Chissel will no longer force the Chips out of the Mortess; then remove the Chis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to the other end of the Mortess, and work, as with the first end, till the Chips will void no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: Then work away the Stuff between the two Ends, and begin again at one of the Ends, and then at the other, and work deeper into the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess, then again between both; and so work deeper by degrees, till you have wrought the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1212705000:104"/>
Mortess through, or (if not through) to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Depth; then with the Mortess-chissel work nearer the drawn Lines at the ends of the Mortess, (for before you were directed to work but within half a quarter of an Inch of the drawn Lines,) by laying light blows on it, till you have made it fit to pare smooth with a narrow Paring-chissel, and then pare the ends, as you were taught to work with the Paring-chissel: Then with the broad Paring-chissel, pare the sides of the Mortess just to the struck Lines; so is the Mortess finished.</p>
                     <p>To work the Tennant, lay the other Quarter on edge upon your Work-bench, and fasten it with the <hi>Holdfast,</hi> as you were taught Sect. I. Then with the Tennant, saw a little without the Struck-line towards the end: You must not Saw just upon the Struck-line, because the Saw cuts rough: Besides, you must leave some Stuff to pare away smooth to the Struck-line, that the <hi>Stile</hi> (that is, the upright Quarter) may make a close Joint with the <hi>Rail</hi> (that is) the lower Quarter: Saw therefore right down with the Tennant-Saw, just almost to the gaged Lines for the thickness of the Tennant, and have a care to keep the Blade of the Saw exactly upright. Then turn the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Side of the Quarter upwards, and work as you were taught to work the first Side.</p>
                     <p>Then with the Paring-chissel, pare the Work close to the gaged Lines for the Tennant. Then try how it fits the Mortess: If it be not pared e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough away, you must pare it where it bears, that is, sticks. But if you should chance to have made it too little, you have spoiled your Work: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may see how necessary it is, not to make the Mortess too wide at first, or the Tennant too narrow.</p>
                     <p>Then with the Piercer pierce two holes through the Sides, or Cheeks of the Mortess, about half an
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1212705000:105"/>
Inch off either end one. Then knock the Tennant stiff into the Mortess, and set it upright, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Angle of the outer Square, to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle the two Quarters make, and with your Prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, prick round about the insides of the Pierced holes upon the Tennant. Then take the Tennant out again, and Pierce two holes with the same Bit, about the thickness of a Shilling above the Pricked holes on the Tennant, that is, nearer the Sholder of the Tennant, that the Pins you are to drive in, may draw the Sholder of the Tennant the closer to the flat side of the Quarter the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess is made in. Then with the Paring-chissel make two Pins somewhat Tapering, full big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and setting the two Quarters again square, as before, drive the Pins stiff into the Pierced holes.</p>
                     <p>If you make another Square, as you did this; and make also a Tennant on each Un-tennanted end of the Stiles, and another Mortess on the top and bottom Rails, you may put them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and make square Frames of them.</p>

                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:1212705000:106"/>It is used for striking a Miter-line, as the Square is to strike a Square-line, by applying the inside of the Handle to the outside of the Quarter, or Batten, you are to work upon; and then by strik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Line by the side of the Tongue: For that Line shall be a Miter-line. And if upon two Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens you strike two such Lines, and Saw and Pare them just off in the Lines, when the flats of those two sawn ends are applied to one another, the out and inside of the Battens, will form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into the Figure of a Square.</p>
                     <p>Thus Picture Frames, and looking Glass-frames, are commonly made, as by a more full Example you may see in the next Section.</p>

                     <p>AS the Square is made to strike an Angle of 90 Degrees, and the Miter an Angle of 45 Degrees, so the Bevil (marked F) having its Tongue movable upon a Center, may be set to strike Angles of any greater, or lesser numbers of Degrees, ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ording as you open the Tongue wider from, or shut it closer to the Handle. It is used as the Square, and the Miter, and will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Offices of them both, though it be not purposely made for either; but for the striking such Bevil-lines, as one part of your work must be cut away to, to make it join with another part of your Work: For Example,</p>
                     <p>We will propose to make a Frame for a Picture, Looking-glass. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> containing eight straight Sides; You may quickly perceive that all the ends of these eight Sides must be cut to Bevils, and what Bevils they must be, you will find if you describe upon a smooth flat Board, a Circle of any bigness, but the larger the better: Divide this Circle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eight equal Parts, and from every point draw a Line to the Center: Draw also straight Lines
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1212705000:107"/>
from every point to its next Point: Then lay the inside of the Handle of your Bevil exactly upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of these straight Lines, so as the Angle made by the inside of the Handle, and the inside of the Tongue, lie exactly at the very Angle made by this straight Line, and the Semi-Diametral Line proceeding from the Center, and move the Tongue nearer, or farther off the Handle, till the inside of the Tongue and the inside of the Handle, lie exactly upon those two Lines, so shall your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil be set.</p>
                     <p>Then having sitted your Pieces to your Scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, stick your Pricker as near the outward Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of your Pieces as your Stuff will bear, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the inside of your Handle also to the outer sides of your Pieces, and so as the inside of the Tongue may be drawn home to the Pricker. For then Lines drawn on those Pieces by the inside of the Tongue, shall be the Lines the Pieces must be cut in, to make these eight Pieces join evenly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the sides of each others Bevil: Then with the Strike-block smooth the ends of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, as you were taught in the Section of the Strike-block.</p>
                     <p>If you have a Board on the back-side of this Frame, you may Glew the back-sides of these Pieces, piece by piece to the Board; but first you must fit them to an exact Compliance of every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil with its Match, and when they are so fitted, drive two Nails close to the outside of every piece, but drive not the Nails deep into the Board, because when the Frame is set, and Glewed, or otherwise fastned, you must draw the Nails out again: For these Nails are only intended to serve for Fences to set, and fit each piece into its proper Place, before the whole Frame is fastned together. And should you not thus Fence them, though by your Eye you might judge you fitted the Bevils
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1212705000:108"/>
exactly, yet one piece being never so little out of its due Position, would drive the next piece more out, and that the next, till at the last, the last piece would not join, but either be too short, or too long, or stand too much out, or in, or else too open, or too close on the out, or inside.</p>
                     <p>But if you have no Board on the backside, you must, when you Saw the Bevilling Angles upon the square ends of pieces, not sawn quite through the depth of one end of every piece, but about half way through the depth, or thickness, and then with your Chissel either split, or else pare, the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per side of the square end flat away to the Bevil, and so leave part of the square end of your piece, to lap under the piece it is joined to. For Example,</p>
                     <p>In Fig. 3. Plate 5. <hi>ab</hi> is the square end of the piece, and <hi>bc</hi> is the Bevil you work the piece to. Therefore you must work away so much of the thickness of the square end, as is comprehended between <hi>a</hi> and <hi>c,</hi> so that you will see the Triangle <hi>abc,</hi> is to be wrought away half way down the thickness of the Stuff, and so will the Triangle <hi>abc</hi> be left for the other half thickness of the Stuff. But that end of the piece marked 1, which joins to the piece marked 2, must, upon its Bevil-stroak, be sawn quite off, and its underside must have the same Triangle wrought into it, just so fit as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Triangle in piece 2, and just so deep, as that when the Triangle on piece 2, is fitted into the Triangle in piece 1, the Superficies of both the pieces may be even with one another. And thus you may lap the ends of every piece into one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                     <p>These Triangles at the ends of the pieces you may Glew into one another, but if you think Glewing alone not strong enough, you may Pierce an hole near the inner edge of the Frame, because the Triangle hath there most Substance of Stuff;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1212705000:109"/>
and afterwards Pin it, as you are taught to Pin the Rail and Stile together in Sect. 17.</p>
                     <p>This way of Lapping over, is sometimes used also for square Miters, or other Angular Frames.</p>

                     <p>THere is another way used by Joiners that make many Frames, to save themselves the labour of Drawing, or striking out of Squares, Miters, and several Bevils upon their Stuff: And this is with a Tool called a <hi>Miter-Box,</hi> described in Plate 5. Fig. 2. It is composed of two pieces of Wood, of an Inch thick each, as A the upright piece, B the bottom piece. The Upright piece is nailed upright, fast upon the bottom piece. And this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right piece hath on its upper side the Miter Lines struck with the Miter Square, as <hi>de,</hi> on the left hand, and <hi>gh</hi> on the right hand: On these two Miter Lines the edge of the Saw is set, and a kerf made straight down the upright piece, as from <hi>de</hi> on the left hand to <hi>f,</hi> and from <hi>gh</hi> on the right hand to <hi>i.</hi> In like manner any other Bevil is struck upon the upper side of the upright piece with the Bevil, as <hi>kl</hi> on the left hand, and <hi>no</hi> on the right. On these two Bevil Lines the edge of the Saw is set, and a kerf made straight down the upright piece, as from <hi>k</hi> to <hi>lm,</hi> and from <hi>gh</hi> to <hi>i.</hi> You may make as many Bevils as you please on the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right piece of the Miter Box; Bevils to join Frames of either five, six, seven, eight Sides, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the manner to make them to any number of Sides, was in part taught in the last Section. For as there you were directed to divide the Circle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eight equal Parts, because eight was the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Sides, we proposed to make that Frame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of; So, if for any number of Sides you divide the Circle into the same equal parts, and work as you were there directed, you may find what Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1212705000:110"/>
the pieces must have that make a Frame that consists of any number of Sides.</p>
                     <p>So also for Sawing of any Batten, or other small pieces square: Strike at the Point <hi>a,</hi> on the upper side of the upright piece a line straight athwart it, to <hi>b,</hi> and Saw straight down the upper piece, to <hi>c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The manner how these Kerfs are sawn straight down with greatest certainty is, thus, Apply the inside of the Handle of the square to the upper side of the upright piece, so as the Tongue lie close to that end of the Miter, Bevil, or square Line struck through the upper side of the Miter-Box, and with the Pricker strike a Line close by the side of the Tongue, through that side of the upright piece; Turn the Tongue to the other side of the upright piece, and apply the inside of the Handle of the square to the other end of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Bevil, or Square Line, and with the Pricker strike also a Line close by the side of the Tongue through that side the upright piece. These two Lines struck on either <hi>side</hi> of the upright piece, shall be a Line on each side in which the edge of the Saw must run, to saw it straight down.</p>

                     <p>IN my former <hi>Exercises,</hi> I did not teach you how to chuse the Tools a Smith was to use; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a Smith's Office to make them: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in those <hi>Exercises</hi> I treated of making Iron-work, and Steel-work in general, and the making and excellency of some Tools in particular, which might serve as a general Notion for the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all Smith's Workmanship, especially to those that should concern themselves with Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But to those that shall concern themselves with Joinery, and not with Smithing; It will be necessary that I teach them how to chuse their Tools that are made by Smiths, that they may use them with more ease and delight, and make both quicker and nearer Work with them.</p>
                     <p>All sorts of Saws, for Joiner's Use, are to be sold in most Iron-monger's Shops, but especially in <hi>Foster-lane, London;</hi> Chuse those that are made
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1212705000:113"/>
of Steel, (for some are made of Iron) for Steel of it self is harder and stronger than Iron: You may know the Steel-<hi>Saws</hi> from Iron-<hi>Saws</hi> thus, The Steel-<hi>Saws</hi> are generally ground bright and smooth, and are (the thickness of the Blade con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered) stronger than Iron-<hi>Saws</hi>: But the Iron-<hi>Saws</hi> are only Hammer-hardned, and therefore if they could be so hard, yet they cannot be so smooth, as if the Irregularities of the Hammer were well taken off with the Grindstone: See it be free from flaws, and very well Hammered, and smoothly Ground, (that is, evenly Ground,) you may know if it be well Hammered by the stiff ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it, and if it be well Ground, (that is, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Ground,) it will not bend in one part of it more than in another; for if it do, it is a sign that part were it bends most is, either too much Ground away, or too thin Forged in that place: But if it bend into a regular bow all the way, and be stiff, the Blade is good: It cannot be too stiff, because they are but Hammer-hardned. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore often bow when they fall under unskilful Hands, but never break, unless they have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten bowed in that place. The Edge whereon the Teeth are, is always made thicker than the Back, because the Back follows the Edge, and if the Edge should not make a pretty wide Kerf, if the Back do not strike in the Kerf, yet by never so little irregular bearing, or twisting of the Hand awry, it might so stop, as to bow the <hi>Saw</hi>; and (as I said before) with often bowing it will break at last. When Workmen light of a good Blade thus qualified, they matter not much whether the Teeth be sharp or deep, or set to their mind: For to make them so, is a Task they take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: And thus they perform it: They wedge the Blade of the <hi>Saw</hi> hard into the <hi>Whetting-Block,</hi> marked P, in <hi>Plate</hi> 4. with the Handle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1212705000:114"/>
their left Hand, and the end of the <hi>Saw</hi> to the right, then with a three-square File they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the left hand end, leaning harder upon the side of the File on the right Hand, than on that side to the left Hand; so that they File the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the Tooth of the Saw a-slope towards the right Hand, and the underside of the Tooth a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a-slope towards the left, or, almost down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. Having filed one Tooth thus, all the rest must be so filed. Then with the <hi>Saw-wrest,</hi> mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed O, in <hi>Plate</hi> 4. they <hi>set</hi> the Teeth of the Saw: That is, they put one of the Notches marked <hi>aaa</hi> of the <hi>Wrest</hi> between the first two Teeth on the Blade of the <hi>Saw,</hi> and then turn the Handle Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontally a little about upon the Notch towards the end of the <hi>Saw</hi>; and that at once turns the first Tooth somewhat towards you, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Tooth from you: Then skipping two Teeth, they again put one of the Notches of the <hi>Wrest</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the third and fourth Teeth on the Blade of the <hi>Saw,</hi> and then (as before) turn the Handle a little about upon the Notch towards the end of the <hi>Saw,</hi> and that turns the third Tooth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what towards you, and the fourth somewhat from you: Thus you must skip two Teeth at a time, and turn the <hi>Wrest</hi> till all the Teeth of the <hi>Saw</hi> are <hi>set.</hi> This <hi>Setting</hi> of the Teeth of the <hi>Saw</hi> (as Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men call it) is to make the Kerf wide enough for the Back to follow the Edge: And is Set <hi>Ranker</hi> for soft, course, cheap Stuff, than for hard, fine, and costly Stuff: For the <hi>Ranker</hi> the Tooth is set, the more Stuff is wasted in the Kerf: And besides, if the Stuff be hard it will require greater Labour to tear away a great deal of hard Stuff, than it will do to tear away but a little of the same Stuff.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pit Saw,</hi> is Set so Rank for course Stuff, as to make a Kerf of almost a quarter of an Inch, but for fine and costly Stuff they set it finer to save
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1212705000:115"/>
Stuff. The <hi>Whip-Saw</hi> is set somewhat finer than the <hi>Pit-Saw</hi>; the <hi>Hand-Saw,</hi> and the <hi>Compass-Saw,</hi> finer than the <hi>Whip-Saw</hi>; but the <hi>Tennant-Saw, Frame-Saw,</hi> and the <hi>Bow-Saw,</hi> &amp;c. are set fine, and have their Teeth but very little turned over the Sides of their Blades: So that a Kerf made by them, is seldom above half a half quarter of an Inch.</p>
                     <p>The reason why the Teeth are filed to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, pointing towards the end of the <hi>Saw,</hi> and not towards the Handle of the <hi>Saw,</hi> or directly straight between the Handle and end of the <hi>Saw,</hi> is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Saw</hi> is designed to cut only in its Progress forwards; Man having in that Activity more strength to rid, and Command of his Hands to guide his Work, than he can have in drawing back his <hi>Saw,</hi> and therefore when he draws back his <hi>Saw,</hi> the Work-man bears it lightly off the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sawn <hi>Stuff</hi>; which is an ease to his Labour, and enables him the longer to continue his several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions of the <hi>Saw.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Master-Workmen, when they direct any of their Underlins to saw such a piece of Stuff, have seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Phrases for the sawing of it: They seldom say <hi>Saw that piece of Stuff</hi>; But <hi>Draw the Saw through it; Give that piece of Stuff a Kerf; Lay a Kerf in that piece of Stuff</hi>; and sometimes, (but most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly,) <hi>Cut,</hi> or <hi>Slit that piece of Stuff</hi>: For the Saw cannot properly be said to cut, or slit the Stuff; but it rather breaks, or tears away such parts of the Stuff from the whole, as the points of the Teeth prick into, and these parts it so tears away are proportionable to the fineness, or rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the setting of the Teeth.</p>
                     <p>The Excellency of Sawing is, to keep the Kerf exactly in the Line marked out to be sawn, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wriggling on either, or both sides; And straight through the Stuff, as Work-men call it;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1212705000:116"/>
that is, in a Geometrical Term, perpendicular through the upper and under side, if your Work require it, as most Work does: But if your Work be to be Sawn upon a Bevil, as some Work some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is, then you are to observe that Bevil all the length of the Stuff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The manner of their working is both alike, for if it be a Board they would slit off a piece of Timber, or if they would take any Square, Quarter, or Batten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> off, they first set off their Scantlin: For Example, If it be an Inch (or more, or less) they would take off a piece of Stuff, they open the Points of their Compasses to an Inch Measure on their Rule, and so much more as they reckon the Kerf of the <hi>Saw</hi> will make, and from on side of their Stuff they set off at either end of the Stuff, the Distance of the points of their Compasses; at this Distance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they make with the points of their Compasses a prick at either end of the Stuff; Then with Chalk they whiten a Line, by rubbing the Chalk pretty hard upon it; Then one holds the Line at one end upon the prick made there, and the other strains the Line pretty stiff upon the prick at the other end; then whilst the Line is thus strain'd, one of them between his Finger and Thumb draws the middle of the Line directly upright, to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient height (that it may spring hard enough down) and then lets it go again, so that it swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applies to its first Position, and strikes so strongly against the Stuff, that the Dust, or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1212705000:117"/>
of the Chalk that were rubbed into the Line, shake out of it, and remain upon the Stuff. And thus also they mark the under side of their Stuff: This is called <hi>Lining of the Stuff</hi>: And the Stuff cut into those Lines shall be called <hi>Inch-Stuff,</hi> because the Compasses that prickt the Stuff, were opened wider by the width of the Kerf than an Inch Measure upon the Rule: But had the Compasses been opened but an Inch exactly, that piece Sawn off should, in Workmen's Language, have been called <hi>In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>When two Work-men are not at hand to hold the Line at both ends, he that Lines it, strikes one point of his Compass, or sometimes a Pricker, or a Nail aslope towards that end into the prick set off, and putting the Noose at the end of his Line over his Compasses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> goes to the other end, and strains his Line on that prick, and strikes it as before.</p>
                     <p>The Stuff being thus lined is fastned with wedges over the <hi>Pit,</hi> (if the Joiner be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated with a <hi>Pit</hi>) if he have none, he makes shift with two high Frames a little more than Man high in its stead, (called <hi>great Trussels</hi>) with four Legs, these Legs stand spreading outwards, that they may stand the firmer: Over these two <hi>Trus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi> the Stuff is laid, and firmly fastned that it shake not. Its outer side from whence the Pricks were set off must be Perpendiculer, which you must try by a Plumb-line, for should the top edge of that side, hang never so little over the bottom edge, or the bottom edge not lie so far out as the top edge, the Scantlin you saw off would not be of an equal thickness on the Top or Bottom: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1212705000:118"/>
the Saw is to work exactly Perpendicular. Then with the <hi>Pit-Saw</hi> they enter the one end of the Stuff, the <hi>Top-man</hi> at the Top, and the <hi>Pit-man</hi> under him: The <hi>Top-man</hi> observing to guide the <hi>Saw</hi> exactly in the Line: And withal draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Saw</hi> somewhat towards him when the <hi>Saw</hi> goes down; and the <hi>Pit-man</hi> drawing it with all his strength Perpendicularly down; but not so low that the upper and lower Handles of the <hi>Saw</hi> sink below both their Managements: Then bearing the Teeth of the <hi>Saw</hi> a little off the Stuff, the <hi>Top-man</hi> draws the <hi>Saw</hi> up again, and the <hi>Pit-man</hi> assists, or eases him in it, and thus they continue sawing on till the <hi>Saw</hi> has run through the whole length upon the Stuff. But when the Kerf is made so long, that by the working of the <hi>Saw</hi> the pieces of Stuff on either side will shake against one another, and so more, or less, hinder the easie Progress of the <hi>Saw,</hi> they drive a Wedge so far in the Kerf as they dare do for fear of splitting the Stuff, and so provide the <hi>Saw</hi> freer and easier Passage through the Stuff: This Wedging they continue so oft as they find occasion.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Glew-pot</hi> is commonly made of good thick Lead, that by its Substance it may retain a heat the longer, that the <hi>Glew Chill</hi> not (as Work-men say when it cools) when it is to be used.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe clearest, driest, and most transparent Glew is the best: When you boil it, break it with your Hammer into small pieces, and put it into a clean Skillet, or Pipkin, by no means greasie, for that will spoil the Clamminess of the Glew, put to it so much Water as is convenient to dissolve the Glew, and to make it, when it is hot, about the thickness of the White of an Egg:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1212705000:123"/>
The quantity of Water cannot be assigned, because of the different Quality there is in Glew: Keep it stirring whilst it is melting, and let it not stick to the sides or bottom of the Vessel: When it is well boiled, pour it into your Glew-pot to use, but let your Glew-pot be very clean. When it is cold, and you would heat it again in your Glew-pot, you must take great care that it burn not to the sides or bottom of the Glew-pot, for that burning either turns to a thick hard skin, or else to a burnt Cinder-like Substance, which if it mingle with the Glew, will spoil it all; because by its Substance it will bear the two Joints you are to Glew together, off each other.</p>
                     <p>When (with often heating) the Glew grows too thick, you may put more Water to it; but then you must make it very hot, lest the Glew and Water do not wholly incorporate.</p>
                     <p>Some Joiners will (when their Glew is too thick, put Small-Beer into it, thinking it streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens it: I have tried it, and could never find it so, but think it makes the Glew weaker, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the Small-Bear chance to be new, and its Yest not well settled from it, or so stale, that it be either Draggy, or any whit mingled with the Settlings of the Cask.</p>

                     <p>YOur Glew must be very warm, for then it is thinnest, and as it chills, it thickens: With a small Brush you must smear the Glew well upon the Joint of each piece you are to Glew together; And before you set them as they are to stand, you must jostle them one upon the other, that the Glew may very well touch and take hold of the Wood; and that the Glew on each Joints may well incorporate. Then fit the two Joints as they must stand; And when you set them by to dry,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1212705000:124"/>
let the one stand upright upon the other; For if they stand a-slope, the weight of the Stuff when it leans upon two extream Edges, may make one end of the Joint <hi>Open.</hi>

                     <p>THe <hi>Waving Engine</hi> discribed in <hi>Plate</hi> 5. <hi>Fig.</hi> 7. Hath A B a long square Plank, of about se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Inches broad, five Foot long, and an Inch and half thick: All along the length of this Plank, on the middle between the two sides, runs a <hi>Rabbet,</hi> as part of it is seen at C: Upon this Rabbet rides a <hi>Block</hi> with a <hi>Groove</hi> in its under side: This <hi>Block</hi> is about three Inches square, and ten Inches long, having near the hinder end of it a wooden Handle going through it, of about one Inch Diameter, as DE: At the Fore-end of this <hi>Block</hi> is fastned a Vice, somewhat larger than a great Hand-Vice, as at F: The <hi>Groove</hi> in the <hi>Block</hi> is made fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Rabbet on the Plank.</p>
                     <p>At the farther end of the Plank is erected a square strong piece of Wood, about six Inches high, and five Inches square, as G. This square piece hath a square wide Mortess in it on the Top, as at H. Upon the top of this square piece is a strong square flat Iron Coller, somewhat loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted on, having two Male Screws fitted into two Female Screws, to screw against that part of the wooden Piece un-mortessed at the Top, mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed L, that it may draw the Iron Coller hard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Iron marked Q, and keep it stiff against the fore-side of the un-mortessed Piece, marked L, when the piece Q, is set to its convenient heighth; and on the other side the square wooden Piece is fitted another Iron screw, having to the end of its shank fastned a round Iron Plate which lies within the hollow of this wooden piece, and therefore cannot in Draft be seen in its proper
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1212705000:125"/>
place; But I have described it a part, as at M. (Fig. 9.) Its Nut is placed at M, on the wooden Piece. On the farther side of the wooden Piece is fitted a wooden Screw called a <hi>Knob,</hi> as at N. Through the farther and hither side of the square wooden Piece is fitted a flat Piece of Iron, about three quarters of an Inch broad, and one quarter of an Inch thick, standing on edge upon the Plank; but its upper edge is filed round: (the reason you will find by and by:) Its hither end comes through the wooden Piece, as at O, and its farther end on the opposite side of the wooden Piece.</p>
                     <p>Upright in the hollow square of the wooden Piece stands an <hi>Iron,</hi> as at Q, whose lower end is cut into the form of the Molding you intend your work shall have.</p>
                     <p>In the fore side of this wooden Piece is a square hole, as at R, called the <hi>Mouth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this Engine belongs a thin flat piece of hard Wood, about an Inch and a quarter broad, and as long as the <hi>Rabbet</hi>: It is disjunct from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, and in Fig. 8. is marked SS, called the <hi>Rack</hi>: It hath its under flat cut into those fashioned Waves you intend your Work shall have: The hollow of these Waves are made to comply with the round edge of flat Plate of Iron marked O (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed before) for when one end of the Riglet you wave, is, with the Vice, screwed to the plain side of the Rack, and the other end put through the Mouth of the wooden Piece, as at TT, so as the hollow of the Wave on the under side of the <hi>Rack</hi> may lie upon the round edge of the flat Iron Plate set on edge, as at O, and the Iron Q, is strong sitted down upon the Reglet: Then if you lay hold of the Handles of the <hi>Block</hi> DE, and strongly draw by them, the Rack and the Riglet will both together slide through the Mouth of the wooden Piece: And as the Rounds of the Rack
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1212705000:126"/>
rid over the round edge of the flat Iron, the Rack and Reglet will mount up to the Iron Q, and as the Rounds of the Waves on the under side of the Rack slides off the Iron on edge, the Rack and Reglet will sink, and so in a Progression (or more) the Riglet will on its upper side receive the Form of the several Waves on the under side of the Rack, and also the Form, or Molding, that is on the edge of the bottom of the Iron, and so at once the Riglet will be both molded and waved.</p>
                     <p>But before you draw the Rack through the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, you must consider the Office of the Knob N, and the Office of the Iron Screw M; For by them the Rack is screwed evenly under the Iron Q. And you must be careful that the Groove of the Block slip not off the Rabbet on the Plank: For by these Screws, and the Rabbet and Groove, your work will be evenly gaged all the way (as I said before) under the edge of the Iron Q, and keep it from sliding either to the right, or left Hand, as you draw it through the Engine.</p>

                  <head>Applied to the ART of <hi>House-Carpentry.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BEING now come to exercise upon the <hi>Carpenters</hi> Trade, it may be expected, by some, that I should insist upon <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture,</hi> it being so absolutely necessary for Builders to be acquainted with: But my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to them is, that there are so many Books of <hi>Architecture</hi> extant, and in them the Rules so well, so copiously, and so compleatly handled, that it is needless for me to say any thing of that Science: Nor do I think any Man that should, can do more than Collect out of their Books, and perhaps de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver their Meanings in his own Words. Besides, <hi>Architecture</hi> is a Mathematical Science, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore different from my present Undertakings, which are (as by my Title) Mechanick Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises: yet because Books of Architecture are as necessary for a Builder to understand, as the use of Tools; and lest some Builders should not know how to enquire for them, I shall at the latter end of <hi>Carpentry</hi> give you the Names of some Authors, especially such as are Printed in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue.</p>
                  <p>Some may perhaps also think it had been more proper for me in these Exercises to have introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Carpentry</hi> before <hi>Joinery,</hi> because Necessity, (the Mother of Invention) did doubtless compel
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1212705000:136"/>
our Fore-fathers in the beginning to use the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of the first, rather than the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of the last. I confess, I considered it my self, and had in my own Reason been persuaded to it. but that I also considered that the Rules they both work by are upon the matter in the same, in <hi>Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Mortessing, Tenanting, Scribing, Paring, Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Moulding,</hi> &amp;c. and likewise the Tools they work with the same, though some of them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what stronger for Carpenter's Use than they need be for Joiner's; because Joiners work more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and observe the Rules more exactly than Carpenters need do. And therefore I say it was, that I began with Joinery before Carpentry; for he that knows how to work curiously, may, when he lists, work slightly; when as they that are taught to work more roughly, do with greater difficulty perform the curious and nice work. Thus we see Joiners Work their Tables exactly flat and smooth, and shoot their Joint so true, that the whole Table shews all one piece: But the Floors Carpenters lay are also by Rule of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentry to be laid flat and true, and shall yet be well enough laid, though not so exactly flat and smooth as a Table.</p>
                  <p>Yet though the Rules Joiners and Carpenters work by are so near the same, and the Tools they work with, and Stuff they work upon, the same; yet there are many Requisites proper to a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, (especially a Master Carpenter) that a Joiner need take little notice of, which, after I have described the Carpenters Tools that are not exprest among the Joiners, I shall speak to.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe <hi>Ax</hi> marked <hi>A</hi> in <hi>Plate</hi> 8. is (as you see) different from what the Joiners Hatchet is,
<pb facs="tcp:1212705000:137"/>
                        <figure/>
                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:1212705000:138"/>
both in Size and Form; theirs being a light Hatchet, with a Basil edge on its left side, because it is to be used with one hand, and therefore hath a short Handle: But the Carpenter's <hi>Ax</hi> being to hew great Stuff, is made much deeper and heavier, and its edge tapering into the middle of its Blade. It hath a long Handle, because it is used with both their Hands, to square or bevil their Timbers.</p>
                     <p>When they use the Ax, the Timber hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly some Bauk or Log laid under it near each end, that the edge of the Ax may be in less danger of striking into the ground, when they hew near the bottom of the Timber. And they commonly stand on that side the Timber they hew upon.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="2" type="section">
                     <head>
                        <hi>§ 2.</hi> Of the <hi>Adz,</hi> and its use.</head>
                     <p>THe <hi>Adz</hi> marked <hi>B</hi> in <hi>Plate</hi> 8. hath its Blade made thin, and somewhat arching. As the Ax hath its edge parallel to its Handle, so the <hi>Adz</hi> hath its edge athwart the Handle, and is ground to a Basil on its inside to its outer edge: Wherefore when it is blunt they cannot well grind it, unless they take its Helve out of its Eye.</p>
                     <p>Its general Use is to take thin Chips off Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or Boards, and to take off those Irregularities that the Ax by reason of its Form cannot well come at; and that a Plane (though rank set) will not make riddance enough with.</p>
                     <p>It is most used for the taking off the Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on the framed Work of a Floor, when it is framed and pin'd together, and laid on its place; for that lying flat under them, the edge of the Ax being parallel to its Handle (as aforesaid) cannot come at the Irregularities to take them off; but the <hi>Adz</hi> having its edge athwart the Handle will. Again, upon some Posts framed upright, and range with other framed Work close to it,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1212705000:139"/>
the edge of the Ax cannot come at the Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the reason aforesaid, but the <hi>Adz</hi> will. And the like for the Irregularities of framed Work on a Ceiling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When they work upon the framed Work of a Floor, they take the end of the Handle in both their Hands, placing themselves directly before the Irregularity, at a small Distance, stradling a little with both their Legs, to prevent Danger from the edge of the <hi>Adz,</hi> and so by degrees hew off the Irregularity. But if they hew upon an Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, they stand directly before it.</p>
                     <p>They sometimes use the <hi>Adz</hi> upon small thin Stuff, to make it thinner, (but this is many times when the Ax, or some other properer Tool, lies not at hand) and then they lay their Stuff upon the Floor, and hold one end of it down with the Ball of the Foot, if the Stuff be long enough; if not, with the ends of their Toes, and so hew it lightly away to their size, form, or both.</p>

                        <hi>§ 3.</hi> Of Carpenters <hi>Chissels</hi> in general.</head>
                     <p>THough Carpenters for their finer Work use all the sorts of <hi>Chissels</hi> described in the Art of Joinery yet are not those sorts of <hi>Chissels</hi> strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for their rougher and more common Work, and therefore they also use a stronger sort of <hi>Chissels</hi>; and distinguish them by the name of <hi>Socket-Chissels</hi>: For whereas those <hi>Chissels</hi> Joiners use have their wooden Heads made hollow to receive the Iron Sprig above the Shoulder of the Shank, Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have their Shank made with an <hi>hollow Socket</hi> at its Top, to receive a strong wooden Sprig made to fit into the <hi>Socket,</hi> with a square Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der above it, the thickness of the Iron of the <hi>Socket,</hi> or somewhat more; which makes it much more strong, and able to endure the heavy blows of the <hi>Mallet</hi> they lay upon the head of the <hi>Chis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.</hi>
                        <pb n="121" facs="tcp:1212705000:140"/>
And the Shanks and Blades are made strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for Carpenter's Use than they are for Joiners.</p>
                     <p>Of these <hi>Socket-Chissels</hi> they have of the several sorts described in Joinery, though not all several<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distinguished by their Names; for they call them <hi>Half-Inch, Three-quarter-Inch Chissels, Inch and Half, Two-Inch,</hi> to <hi>Three-Inch Chissels,</hi> according to the breadth of the Blade. But their Uses are the same mentioned in Joinery, though the manner of using them be somewhat different too: For, as I told you in Joinery, the Joiners press the edge of the Blade into the Stuff, with the strength of their Shoulders, but the Carpenters with the force of the blows of the Mallet. And the Joiners guide their <hi>Chissels</hi> differently from what the Carpenters do their <hi>Socket-Chissels</hi>; for the Joiners hold the Shank and Blade of their <hi>Chissels,</hi> as I described in Joinery, <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. but the Carpenters hold the Shank of their <hi>Chissels</hi> in their clutched left Hand, and beat upon the Head with the <hi>Mallet</hi> in the right. See the Figure of <hi>Socket-Chissel</hi> in <hi>Plate</hi> 8. C. with its Head <hi>a</hi> out of the Socket.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Ripping-Chissel</hi> described in <hi>Plate</hi> 8. D. is a <hi>Socket-Chissel,</hi> and is about an Inch broad, and hath a blunt Edge. Its Edge hath not a <hi>Basil,</hi> as almost all other <hi>Chissels</hi> have, and therefore would more properly be called a <hi>Wedge</hi> than a <hi>Chissel</hi> But most commonly Carpenters use an old cast off <hi>Chis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel</hi> for a <hi>Ripping-Chissel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Its Office is not to cut Wood, as others do, but to <hi>rip</hi> or <hi>tear</hi> two pieces of Wood fastned together from one another, by entering the blunt Edge of it between the two pieces, and then knocking hard with the Mallet upon the head of the Handle, till you drive the thicker part of it between the two pieces, and so force the power that holds
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1212705000:141"/>
them together (be it Nails, or otherwise) to let go their hold: For its blunt Edge should be made of Steel, and well tempered, so that if you knock with strong blows of the Mallet the <hi>Chissels</hi> Edge upon a Nail (though of some considerable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) it may cut or brake it short asunder. If you cannot, at once, placing the <hi>Ripping-Chissel,</hi> part the two pieces, you must use two <hi>Ripping-Chissels,</hi> placing the second at the remotest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance in the breach, and driving that home, will both open the breach wider, and loosen the first <hi>Ripping-Chissel,</hi> so that you may take it again, and place it farther in the breach: And so you must continue edging farther and farther, till you have separated your intended pieces.</p>
                     <p>It is sometimes used when Carpenters have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Error in their Work, and must undo what they did, to mend it. But it is generally used in all Alterations, and old Work.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Draw-knife</hi> described <hi>Plate</hi> 8. E. is seldom used about House-building, but for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of some sorts of Houshold-stuff; as the Legs of Crickets, the Rounds of Ladders, the Rails to lay Cheese or Bacon on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When they use it, they set one end of their Work against their Breast, and the other end a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Work-bench, or some hollow Angle that may keep it from slipping, and so pressing the Work a little hard with their Breast against the Bench, to keep it steddy in its Position, they with the Handles of the <hi>Draw knife</hi> in both their Hands, enter the edge of the <hi>Draw-knife</hi> into the Work, and draw Chips almost the length of their Work, and so smoothen it quickly.</p>

F. <hi>a</hi> the <hi>Pin, b</hi> the <hi>Hook, c</hi> the <hi>Head.</hi> Its Office is to pin the Frame of a Floor, or Frame of a Roof to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whilst it is framing, or whilst it is fitting into its Position. They have many of these <hi>Hook-Pins</hi> to drive into the several Angles of the Frame. These drive into the Pin-holes through the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesses and Tennants, and being made Taper, do with a Hammer striking on the bottom of it knock it out again; or they most commonly strike under the Hook, and so knock it out. Then if the Frame lie in its place, they pin it up with wooden Pins.</p>

Its chief Use is for driving Nails into Work, and drawing Nails out of Work.</p>
                     <p>There is required a pretty skill in driving a Nail; for if (when you set the point of a Nail) you be not curious in observing to strike the flat face of the <hi>Hammer</hi> perpendicularly down upon the perpendicular of the Shank, the Nail (unless it have good entrance) will start aside<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or bow, or break; and then you will be forced to draw it out again with the <hi>Claw</hi> of the <hi>Hammer.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may see a reason when you buy a <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> to chuse one with a true flat <hi>Face.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A little trick is sometimes used among some (that would be thought cunning Carpenters) pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to touch the Head of the Nail with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Ear-wax, and then lay a Wager with a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Trick, that he shall not drive that Nail up to the Head with so many blows. The
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1212705000:144"/>
stranger thinks he shall assuredly win, but does assuredly lose; for the <hi>Hammer</hi> no sooner touches the Head of the Nail, but instead of entring the Wood it flies away, notwithstanding his utmost care in striking it down-right.</p>

                     <p>There are also some Engines used in Carpentry, for the management of their heavy Timber, and hard Labour, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Jack,</hi> the <hi>Crab,</hi> to which belongs Pullies and Tackle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wedges, Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, great Screws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I shall give you an

                        <hi>§ 13.</hi> Of the <hi>Ten-foot Rod,</hi> and thereby to measure and describe the <hi>Ground-plot.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>WE shall begin therefore to measure the <hi>Ground-plot,</hi> to which Carpenters use a <hi>Ten-foot Rod</hi> for Expedition, which is a Rod about an Inch square, and ten foot long; being divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ten equal parts, each part containing one foot, and is divided into 24 equal parts, and their Sub-divisions.</p>
                     <p>With this <hi>Rod</hi> they measure the length and breadth of the <hi>Ground-plot</hi> into Feet, and if there be odd Inches, they measure them with the <hi>Two-foot Rule.</hi> Their measure they note down upon a piece of paper, and having considered the situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sides, <hi>East, West, North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> they draw on paper their several Sides accordingly, by a small Scale, either elected, or else made for that purpose. They may elect their <hi>Two-foot Rule</hi> for some plots; for an Inch and an half may commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously serve to set off one Foot on some small <hi>Ground-plots,</hi> and then you have the Inches to that Foot actually divided by the Marks for the half quarters on the <hi>Two-foot Rule.</hi> But this large Scale will scare serve to describe a <hi>Ground-plot</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ten Foot in length, because a small sheet of Paper is not above 15 or 16 Inches long, and therefore one sheet of Paper will not contain it, if the <hi>Ground-plot</hi> be longer: Therefore if you make every half quarter of an Inch to be a Scale for two Inches, a sheet of Paper will contain 20 Foot in length: And if you make every half quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Inch to be a Scale for four Inches, a sheet of Paper will contain 40 Foot. And thus by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing the Scale, the sheet of Paper will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a greater number of Feet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:1212705000:146"/>But having either elected, or else made your Scale, you are to open your Compasses to the number of Feet on your Scale your <hi>Ground-plot</hi> hath in length, and then transfer that Distance to your paper, and to draw a straight Line between the two points, and mark that straight Line with <hi>East, West, North</hi> or <hi>South,</hi> according to the situation of that side of the <hi>Ground-plot</hi> it represents. Then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain open your Compasses to the number of Feet on your Scale one of the adjoining Sides contains, and transfer that Distance also to your paper, and draw a Line between the two points, and note its situation of <hi>East, West, North</hi> or <hi>South,</hi> as before. Do the like by the other Sides; and if either a Quirk, or any Addition, be added to the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on any side of your <hi>Ground-plot,</hi> you must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it also proportionably.</p>
                     <p>Then you are to consider what Apartments, or Partitions, to make on your <hi>Ground-plot,</hi> or second, or third Story, and to set them off from your Scale, beginning at your intended Front. As for Example, Suppose your <hi>Ground-plot</hi> be a Long-square, 50 Foot in length, and 20 Foot wide: This <hi>Ground-plot</hi> will contain in its length two good Rooms, and a Yard behind it 10 Foot long. If you will, you may divide the 40 Foot into two equal parts, so will each Room be 20 Foot square: Or you may make the Rooms next the Front deeper, or shallower, and leave the remainder for the Back-Room: As here the Front-Room is 25 Foot, and the Back-Room 15 Foot deep, and a setting off of 8 Foot broad and 10 Foot long tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Yard, for a Buttery below Stairs (if you will) and Closets above Stairs over it. But what width and depth soever you intend your Rooms shall have, you must open your Compasses to that number of Feet on your Scale, and set off that Distance on the <hi>East, West, North</hi> or <hi>South,</hi>
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:1212705000:147"/>
Line, according to the Situation of that side it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents on your <hi>Ground-plot.</hi> If you set it off the <hi>East</hi> Line, you must also set it off on the <hi>West</hi>; if on the <hi>North</hi> Line, you must also set it off on the <hi>South</hi> Line: Because between the two Settings off on the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> Lines, or <hi>North</hi> or <hi>South</hi> Lines, you must draw a straight Line of the length of your intended Partition. And in this manner you must from every Partition draw a Line in its proper place on the Paper, by measuring the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances each Partition must have from the outside of the <hi>Ground-plot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus you are also to describe by your Scale your Front, and several sides of the Carcase; allowing the <hi>Principal Posts, Enterduces, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings, Braces, Gables, Doors, Windows,</hi> and <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> their several Sizes, and true Positions by the Scale: Each side upon a Paper by it self: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we shall suppose our Master-Workman to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>Perspective</hi>; for then he may, on a sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle piece of Paper, describe the whole Building, as it shall appear to the Eye at any assigned Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>HAving drawn the <hi>Draft,</hi> the Master-Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is first to cause the Cellars to be dug, if the House shall have Cellars. And then to try the Ground, that it be all over of an equal firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that when the weight of the Building is set upon it, it may not sink in any part. But if the Ground be hollow or weaker in any place, he strengthens it, sometimes by well ramming it down, and levelling it again with good dry Earth, Lime-Core, Rubbish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or sometimes with ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in Stones, or sometimes with well Planking it; or most securely by driving in Piles. But driving in of Piles is seldom used for Timber

Houses, but for Stone, or Brick Houses, and that but in few places of <hi>England</hi> neither, but where the Ground proves <hi>Fenny,</hi> or <hi>Moorish.</hi> Therefore a farther account shall be given of Foundations, when I come to exercise upon <hi>Masonry,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Then are the Celler-Walls to be brought up by a <hi>Brick-layer</hi> with <hi>Brick</hi>; for small Houses two Bricks thick, for bigger two and an half Bricks thick, or three or four Bricks thick, according to the bigness of the House, and quality of the Ground, as I shall shew when I come to Exercise on <hi>Bricklaying.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the House be designed to have no Cellars (as many Country-Houses have not) yet for the better securing the Foundation, and preserving the Timber from rotting, Master-Workmen will cause three, or four, or five course of Bricks to be laid, to lay their <hi>Ground-plates</hi> upon that Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The Foundation being made good, the Master-Workman appoints his Under-Workmen their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Scantlins,</hi> for <hi>Ground-plates, Principal Post<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Draft of a Foundation I have described in <hi>Plate</hi> 10, according to a Scale of eight Foot in an Inch; where you have the Front AB 20 Foot long, the sides AC and BD 50 Foot long. The Shop, or first Room, EE 25 Foot (as aforesaid) deep. I make the first Room a Shop, because I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to describe <hi>Shop-windows, Stalls,</hi> &amp;c. though you may Build according to any other purpose: The <hi>Kitching,</hi> or <hi>Back-Room</hi> FF 15 Foot deep.

                     <p>I do not deliver this Draft of Partitions for the most Commodious for this Ground-plot, nor is the House set out designed for any particular Inhabitant; which is one main purpose to be considered of the Master-Workman, before he make his Draft; for a Gentleman's House must not be divided as a Shop-keeper's, nor all Shop-keepers House a-like; for some Trades require a deeper, others may dispence with a shallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Shop, and so an Inconvenience may arise in both. For if the Shop be shallow, the Front Rooms upwards ought to be shallow also: Because by the strict Rules of <hi>Architecture,</hi> all Partitions of Rooms ought to stand directly over one another: For if your Shop stands in an eminent Street, the Front Rooms are commonly more Airy than the Back Rooms; and always more Commodious for observing publick P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> that respect it will be inconvenient to make the Front Rooms shallow: But if you have a fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect backwards of Gardens, Feilds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which seldom happens in Cities) then it may be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to make your Back-Rooms the larger for Entertainment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Though I have spoken singularly of one Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Post, yet as you work this, you must work all four Principal Posts; and then set them plumb upright, which you must try with a Plumb-line described in <hi>Plate</hi> 8 §. 8.</p>
                     <p>Having erected the Principal Posts upright, you must enter the Tennants of the Bressum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers into their proper Mortesses, and with a Nail or two (about a single Ten or a double Ten) tack one end of a deal Board, or some other like piece of Stuff to the Bressummer, and the other end to the Fram'd Work of the Floor, to keep the Principal Posts upright, and in their places Then set up the several Posts between the Principal Posts; but these Posts must be Tennanted at each end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because they are to be no longer than to reach from Story to Story, or from Entertise to Entertise, and are to be framed into the upper and under Bres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summer. If the Entertises be not long enough, they set up a Principal Post between two or three Lengths, to reach from the Ground-plate up to the Raising-plates</p>
                     <p>It is to be remembred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Bressum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers and Girders are laid flat upon one o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> sides Perpendicular to the Ground-plot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; but the Joysts are to be laid contrary: For they
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1212705000:156"/>
are Framed so as to lie with one of their nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowest sides upwards, with their two broadest sides Perpendicular to the Ground-plot. The reason is, because the Stuff of the Bressummers and Girders are less weakned by cutting the Mortesses in them in this Position, than in the other Position; for as the Tennants for those Mortesses are cut between the top and bottom sides, and the flat of the Tennants are no broader than the flat of the narrowest side of the Joysts; so the Mortesses they are to fit into, need be no broader than the breadth of the Tennant, and the Tennants are not to be above an Inch thick, and consequently the Mortesses are to be made with an Inch Mortess-Chissel, as was shewn in <hi>Joinery,</hi> p. 86. for great care must be taken that the Bressummers and Girders be not weakned more than needs, lest the whole Floor dance,</p>
                     <p>These Tennants are cut through the two nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowest sides, rather than between the two broadest sides, because the Stuff of the Girders retains more strength when least of the Grain of the Stuff is cut: And the Tennants being made between the narrowest sides of the Joyces, requires their Mortess-holes no longer than the breadth of that Tennant: And that Tennant being but an Inch thick, requires its Mortess but an Inch wide to receive it; so that you Mortess into the Girder no more than three Inches wide with the Grain of the Stuff, and one Inch broad contrary to the Grain of the Stuff. But should the Tennant be cut between the two broad sides of the Joysts, the Mortess would be three Inches long, and but one Inch broad, and consequently, you must cut into the Girder three Inches cross the Grain of the Stuff, which would weaken it more than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:1212705000:157"/>But it may be objected that the Tennants of the Joysts being so small, and bearing at an Inch thickness must needs be too weak.</p>
                     <p>Answer, First, Though the Tennants be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but an Inch thick, and three Inches broad; yet the whole Bearing of the Joyces do not solely depend upon their Tennants; because the Girders they are framed into, prove common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly somewhat Wainny upon their upper sides, and the Joysts are always scribed to project over that Waynniness, and so strengthen their Bearing by so much as they project over the Roundness or Waynniness of the upper side of the Girder.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Floor is boarded with the length of the Boards athwart the Joysts, and these Boards firmly railed down to the Joysts, which also adds a great strength to them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Joysts are seldom made to Bear at above ten Foot in length, and should by the Rule of good Workmanship, not lie above ten Inches asunder at the most: So that this short Bearing and close discharging of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, renders the whole Floor firm enough for all common Occupation. But if the Joyces do Bear at above ten Foot in length, it ought to be the care of the Master-workman to provide stronger Stuff for them, <hi>viz</hi> Thicker and Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. If not, they cut a Tusk on the upper side of the Tennant, and let that Tusk into the upper side of the Girders.</p>
                     <p>Having erected the Principal Post, and other Posts, and fitted in the Bressummers, Girders, Joysts, <hi>&amp;c</hi> upon the first Floor, they pin up all the Frame of Carcass-work. But though the Girders and Joysts described for this first Floor, lie proper enough for it; yet for the second Story, and in this particular Case, the Joysts lie not proper for the second Story; because
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1212705000:158"/>
in the second Story we have described a <hi>Balcony.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore in this Case you must frame the Front-Bressummer about seven Inches lower into the Principal Posts: Because the Joysts for the second Floor are not to be Mortessed into the Bressummer to lie even at the top with it, but must lie upon the Bressummer, and project over it so far as you design the <hi>Balcony</hi> to project beyond the Upright of the Front: And thus laying the Joysts upon the Bressummer renders them much stronger to bear the <hi>Balcony,</hi> than if Joysts were Tennanted into the Front of the Bres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summer, and so project out into the Street from it.</p>
                     <p>But the Truth is, Though I have given you a Draft of the Joysts lying athwart the Front and Rear for the first Floor, you may as well lay them Range with the two sides on the first Floor. But then the Bressummer that reaches from Front to Rear in the middle of the Floor must be stronger: And Girders must then be Tennanted into the Bressummer, and the Ground-plates at such a Distance, that the Joysts may not Bear at above ten Foot in length. And the Tennants of the Joysts must be Tennanted into the Girders, so that they will then lie Range with the two Sides.</p>
                     <p>But, a word more of the Bressummer: I say (as before) the Bressummer to Bear at so great Length must be stronger, though it should be discharged at the Length of the Shop, (<hi>viz.</hi> at 25 Foot) with a Brick Wall, or a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on brought up of Brick. But if it should have no Discharge of Brick-work, but Bear at the whole 40 Foot in Length, your Bressummer must be yet considerably stronger than it need be, were it to Bear but 25 Foot in Length; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the shorter all the Bearings of Timbers are, the firmer they Bear. But then the Fraim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Work will take up m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re Labour: And in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1212705000:159"/>
many Cases it is cheaper to put in stronger Stuff for long Bearings, than to put a Girder between, to Discharge the Length of the Joysts to be fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Girders.</p>
                     <p>But to make short of this Argument, I shall give you the Scheme of Scantlins of Timber at several Bearings for <hi>Summers, Girders, Joysts, Rafters,</hi> &amp;c. as they are set down in the Act of Parlia. for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building the City of <hi>London,</hi> after the late dreadful Fire: Which Scantlins were well consulted by able Workmen before they were reduced into an Act.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IN Brick Buildings the <hi>Window-Frames</hi> are so framed, that the Tennants of the Head-sell, Ground-sell, and Transum, run though the outer <hi>Jaums</hi> about four Inches beyond them: And so they are set in a Lay of Morter upon the Brick-wall before the <hi>Peers</hi> on either side is brought up, at about three Inches within the Front; So that the Brick-work over the Head and about the Jaums defend it from the Weather. Then the <hi>Bricklayer</hi> brings up the <hi>Peers</hi> on both sides, so that the four Ends or Tennants that project through the outer Jaums being buried and trimmed into the Brick-work become a Fastning to the <hi>Window-Frame.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:1212705000:164"/>But if the Window-Frame stands on a Timber-house, the Head and Ground-sell are sometimes Tennanted into Posts of the Carcass; and then the Posts do the Office of the outer Jaums of the Window-Frame; and the Head and Ground-sell are then called <hi>Entertises,</hi> and therefore both Head and Ground-sell, and Posts or Jaums, are rabbetted about half an Inch on the outside of the Front, to receive the Pane of Glass that is fitted to it. And thus (as I said) the Posts become part of the Window-Frame.</p>
                     <p>But the better way is to frame a Window as the Brick-work Window, and to project it an Inch and a half beyond the side of the Building, and to Plaister against its sides, for the better securing the rest of the Carcass from the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>The Window-Frame hath every one of its Lights Rabbetted on its outside about half an Inch into the Frame, and all these Rabbets, but that on the Ground-sell, are grooved square, but the Rabbets on the Ground-sell is bevell'd down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that Rain or Snow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may the freelier fall off it. Into these Rabbets the several Panes of Glass-work is set, and fastned by the Glasier.</p>
                     <p>The square Corners of the Frame next the Glass is Bevell'd away both on the out and inside of the Building, that the Light may the freelier play upon the Glass And upon that Bevel is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Stuck a Molding (for Ornament sake) according to the Fancy of the Workman, but more generally according to the various Mode of the Times.</p>

                        <hi>§ 17.</hi> Of <hi>Stairs,</hi> and <hi>Stair-Cases.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>SEveral Writers of <hi>Architecture</hi> have delivered different Rules for the Height and Breadth of <hi>Steps,</hi> and that according to the several Capacities of the <hi>Stair-Cases.</hi> They forbid more than six, and less than four Inches for the Heighth of each Step, and more than sixteen, and less than twelve, for the Breadth of each Step. But here we must understand they mean these Measures should be observed in large and sumptuous Buildings: But we have here proposed an ordinary private House, which will admit of no such Measures, for want of room. Therefore to our present purpose.</p>
                     <p>The first and second Pair of Stairs the Steps shall be about 7 ⅓ Inches high, and 10 Inches broad. The third Pair of Stairs each Step may be about 6 ½ Inches high, and 9 ½ Inches broad. And for the fourth Pair of Stairs, each Step may be about 6 Inches high, and 9 Inches broad. But this Rule they do, or should follow, <hi>viz.</hi> to make all the Steps belonging to the same pair of Stairs of an equal height; which to do, they first consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the heighth of the Room in Feet and odd Inches, if any odd be, and multiply the Feet by 12, whose Product, with the number of odd Inches, gives the sum of the whole Heighth in Inches; which sum they divide by the number of Steps they intend to have in that Heighth, and the Quotient shall be the number of Inches and parts that each Step shall be high. Or, if they first design the Heighth of each Step in Inches, they try by Arithmetick how many times the Heighth of a Step they can have out of the whole Heighth of the Story, and so know the number of Steps.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>STAIRS are either made about a <hi>Solid Newel,</hi> or an <hi>Open Newel,</hi> and sometimes mixt, <hi>viz.</hi> with a Solid Newel for some few Steps; then a straight or Foreright Ascent, with <hi>Flyers</hi> upon the side of the square Open Newel, and afterwards a Solid Newel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Than reiterate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Mixt Newel'd Stairs,</hi> are commonly made in our <hi>Party-walled Houses</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> where no Light can be placed in the Stair-Case, because of the Party-walls; so that there is a necessity to let in a <hi>Sky-light</hi> through the Hollow Newel: But this sort of Stair-Cases take up more room than those with a single so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Newel; because the Stairs of a solid Newel spread only upon one small Newel, as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Foulds of the Fans Woman use spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Center: But these because they some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wind, and sometimes fly off from that winding, take therefore the more room up in the Stair-Case.</p>
                  <p>The manner of projecting them, is copiously taught in many Books of <hi>Architecture,</hi> whether I referr you: Yet not to leave you wholly in the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1212705000:168"/>
dark, I shall give you a small light into it. And first of the <hi>Solid Nowel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Winding Stairs are projected on a round <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file,</hi> whose Diameter is equal to the Base the Stair-Case is to stand on, suppose six foot square. This <hi>Profile</hi> hath its Circumference divided into 16 equal parts. The Semi-diameter of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file</hi> is divided into four equal parts, and one of them used for the Newel, and the rest for the length of the Steps: If you draw Lines from the Center through every one of the equal parts into the Circumference, the space between every two Lines will be the true Figure of a <hi>Winding-Step.</hi> And if they were all cut out and placed one above another, over the true place on the Profile round about the Newel, whose Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is one quarter the length of a Step, you would by supporting each Step with a <hi>Raiser</hi> have the modle of a true pair of <hi>Winding-Stairs.</hi> See Plate 10. Fig. 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hollow Newel'd</hi> Stairs are made about a square Hollow Newel. We will suppose the <hi>Well-hole</hi> to be eleven foot long, and six foot wide; and we would bring up a pair of Stairs from the first <hi>Floor</hi> eleven Foot high; it being intended that a Skie-light shall fall through the Hollow Newel upon the Stairs: We must therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the width and breadth of the Hollow New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el; and in this example admit it to be two foot and a half wide, and two foot broad: By the width I mean the sides that range with the Front and Rear of the Building, and by the breadth I mean the sides that range with the Party-walls.</p>
                  <p>I find (by the Rule aforesaid) that if I assign 18 Steps up, each Step will be seven Inches and one third of an Inch high.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:1212705000:169"/>You must Note, that the flying off, or else winding of these Steps will vary their places ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you design the first Ascent. For if you make the first Ascent as you come straight out of the Street (as in Plate 10.) on the <hi>South-side,</hi> you will first ascend upon a Pitch of <hi>Flyers,</hi> which Pitch (making an Angle of 38 deg. with the Floor) with ten Steps raise you six Foot high above the Floor, and bring you eight Foot towards the <hi>North</hi>-end of the <hi>Well-hole,</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king each Step ten Inches broad.</p>
                  <p>But now you must leave <hi>Flyers,</hi> and make four Winding Steps. These Winding Steps are made about a solid <hi>Newel</hi> (as hath been taught) and this <hi>Newel</hi> serves also for a <hi>Post</hi> to <hi>Trim</hi> the <hi>Stair-Case</hi> too. This Post stands upon the Floor, and is prolonged upwards so high, that Mortesses made in it may receive the Tennants of the <hi>Top</hi> and <hi>Bottom Rails</hi> of the whole Stair-case for that Floor: These four Winding steps aforesaid, rounding one quarter about the Newel, turns your Face in your Ascent now towards the <hi>East</hi>; these four steps are raised 2 foot, 5 ⅓ Inches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Flyers, so that (in all) your Stairs are now raised 8 foot 6 ⅔ Inches. Here remains now only 2 foot 5 ½ Inches to the <hi>Landing place,</hi> and these take up just four Flyers, which must be made as was taught before.</p>
                  <p>But now in your second pair of Stairs, it will be proper to begin your Ascent with your Face towards the <hi>West:</hi> For landing by the first pair of Stairs with your Face towards the <hi>East,</hi> you turn by the side of the Rail on the second Floor from the <hi>East</hi> towards the <hi>North,</hi> and at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of that Rail, you turn your Face again from the <hi>North</hi> towards the <hi>West,</hi> and begin your Ascent on the second pair of Stairs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:1212705000:170"/>Between the Skie-light and the Ascent is a Post set upright to fasten Rails into: (to bound the Stair-case) from the bottom of which, <hi>viz.</hi> on the second Floor you trim up three Flyers, and then turn off a quarter of a Circle, with Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Steps: Then again, Flyers to your designed pitch: And then again another quarter of a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle with Winding Steps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Rail these Steps are built upon, being at the beginning or bottom of the Ascent framed or otherwise fastned to the first upright Post, must at its higher end be framed into the next Post also, with a Bevel Tennant, as you were taught to frame <hi>Quarters</hi> into one another, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. § 17. Only with this difference, that there you were taught to frame Square; but here you must frame upon the <hi>Bevel,</hi> as you were taught, <hi>Numb</hi> 5. § 19. This Post aforesaid bears upon the Floor, to make its Bearing the stronger; and this Post must be continued to such an heighth, as it may also serve to receive the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted end of an upper and lower Rail framed into it. And between these <hi>Bevelling Rails, Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> make good the outside of the <hi>Stair-Case.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though I have here described this Contrivance of a pair of Stairs, yet do I not deliver it as the best Patern for this Building, or for these sorts of Stairs, nor matters it to our purpose whether it be or no; for (as I told you before) my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking is the <hi>Doctrine of Handy-works,</hi> not <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture</hi>; but it's <hi>Architecture</hi> considers the best forming of all Members in a Building for the capacity of the Ground-Plot, and the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the intended Inhabitant; but Carpenters (as Carpenters) only work by directions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the Architect.</p>
                  <p>These therefore are the common Rules that these sorts of Stairs, and indeed all others with
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1212705000:171"/>
carving according to the Profile or Ground-plot of the Stairs are made by. But those that will see many Inventions may consult Books of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>THough Carpenters never Floor the Rooms till the Carcass is set up, and also inclosed by the Plaisterer, lest weather should wrong the Flooring; yet they generally <hi>Rough-plane</hi> their <hi>Boards</hi> for Flooring before they begin any thing else about the Building, that they may set them by to season: Which thus they do, they lean them one by one on end aslant with the edge of the Board against a Bauk, somewhat above the height of half the length of the Board, and set another Board in the same posture on the other side the Bauk, so that above the Bauk they cross one another: Then on the first side they set ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Board in that posture, and on the second side another, till the whole number of Boards are set an end: Being set in this posture, there remains the thickness of a Board between every Board all the length, but just where they cross one another, for the Air to pass through to dry and shrink them, against they have occasion to use them: But they set them under some cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Shed, that the Rain or Sun comes not at them; for if the Rain wet them, instead of shrinking them, it will smell them; or if the Sun shine fiercely upon them, it will dry them so fast, that the Boards will <hi>Tear</hi> or <hi>Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> which is in vulgar English, <hi>Split</hi> or <hi>Crack.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They have another way to dry and season them, by laying them flat upon three or four Bauks, each Board about the breadth of a Board asunder, the whole length of the Bauks. Then they lay another Lay of Boards athwart upon
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1212705000:172"/>
them, each Board also the breadth of a Board asunder; then another Lay athwart the last, till all are thus laid: So that in this position they also lye hollow for the Air to play between them.</p>
                     <p>Thus then, the Boards being Rough-plain'd and Season'd. They try one side flat, as by <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. § 31. and both the edges straight, as if they were to shoot a Joint; as by <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. § 4. and cut the Boards to an exact length, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if the Boards are not long enough to reach athwart the whole Room, the ends may all lye in a straight Line, that the straight ends of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Boards laid against them may make the truer Joint, and this they call a <hi>Beaking Joint.</hi> But before they lay them upon the Floor, they try with the <hi>Level</hi> (described § 7.) the flatness of the whole Frame of Flooring again, lest any part of it should be <hi>Cast</hi> since it was first framed together; and if any part of the Floor lye too high, they with the <hi>Adz</hi> (if the eminency be large) take it off, as was shewed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 2. Or if it be small, with the <hi>Jack-Plain</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> 4 § 2. till it lye level with the rest of the Floor. But if any part of the Floor prove hollow, they lay a Chip, or some such thing, upon that hollow place, to bare up the Board, before they nail it down.</p>
                     <p>All this being done, they chuse a Board of the commonest thickness of the whole Pile for the first Board, and lay it close again one side of the Room athwart the Joysts, and so nail it firmly down with two Brads into every Joyst it crosses, each Brad about an Inch, or an Inch and a half within the edge of the Board.</p>
                     <p>If they should lay more than an ordinary thick or thin Board at the first, they would have a greater number of Boards to work to a Level
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1212705000:173"/>
than they need, because all the rest of the Boards must be equalized in thickness to the first.</p>
                     <p>Then they lay a second Board close to the first. But before they nail it down they again try how its sides agrees with the side of the first, and also how its thickness agrees with the first Board. If any part of its edge lye hollow off the edge of the first Board, they shoot off so much of the length of the Board from that hollowness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards either end, till it comply and make a close Joint with the first. But if the edge swell in any place, they plain of that swelling till it comply as aforesaid.</p>
                     <p>If the second Board prove thicker than the first, then with the <hi>Adz</hi> (as aforesaid) they hew away the under side of that Board (most commonly cross the Grain, lest with the Grain the edge of the <hi>Adz</hi> should slip too deep into the Board) in every part of it that shall bare upon a Joyst, and so sink it to a flat superficies to comply with the first Board. If the Board be too thin, they underlay that Board upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Joyst with a Cap, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as this second Board is laid, so are the other Boards laid, if they be well assured the Boards are dry, and will not shrink; but if they doubt the driness of the Boards, they (some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do, or should) take a little more pains; for after they have nailed down the first Board, they will measure the breadth of two other Boards, laying them by the side of the first. But yet they will not allow them their full Room to lye in, but after there edges are true shot in a straight line, they will pinch them off about half a quarter of an Inch room more or less, according as they guess at the well-season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness of the Boards; by nailing down the fourth Board nearer to the first Board by half a quarter
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1212705000:174"/>
of an Inch (more or less) then the breadth of both Boards are. And though it be afterwards somewhat hard to get these two Boards into that narrow room, <hi>viz.</hi> between the first and fourth Board, yet they help themselves thus: The under-edge of these Boards that are to join to each other, they Bevel somewhat away, and then the first and fourth Board being fast nailed down (as aforesaid) they set the outer edges of these two Boards again the two nailed Boards, letting the inner edges of the two loose Boards meet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make an Angle perpendicular to the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap> upon that Angle, these two Boards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> with forcing Pins and Wedges, force them together: And then with Brads they nail them down, as they did the first Board. Thus afterwards they nail down a seventh Board, as they did the fourth, and then fit in the fifth and sixth Boards, as they did the second and third Boards. And so on, nailing down every third Board, and forcing two others between it and the last nailed Board, till the whole Floor be boarded.</p>
                     <p>But if these Boards are not long enough (as I hinted before) to reach through the whole Room, they examine how true the ends lye in a straight line with one another, by applying the edge of the Two-foot Rule to the ends, and where the ends of any Boards keep of the edge of the Two-foot Rule from complying with the whole range of ends, they with the <hi>Chissel</hi> and <hi>Mallet</hi> cut off that irregularity, holding and guiding the Chissel, so that it may rather cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way more of the bottom then top of the Board, that so the Boards joined to the ends of the first
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1212705000:175"/>
laid Boards, may make on the Superficies of the Floor the finer and truer Joint.</p>
                     <p>Having thus Boarded the whole Room, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they used their best diligence to do it exactly, yet may the edges of some Boards lye somewhat higher than the Board it lies next to; therefore they peruse the whole Floor, and where they find any irregularities they plane them off with the Plane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>§ 19.</hi> The <hi>Hanging</hi> of <hi>Doors, Windows,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>THe Floors being Boarded, the next work is to <hi>Hang</hi> the <hi>Doors,</hi> in which tho' there be little difficulty, yet is there much care to be taking, that the <hi>Door</hi> open and shut well.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Door</hi> have a <hi>Door-Case</hi> (as Chamber-Doors, and Closet-Doors commonly have) the <hi>Jaums</hi> of the Door-Case must stand exactly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular, which you must try by the Plumb-line, as by § 8. and the Head of the <hi>Door-Case</hi> or Entertise must be fitted exactly square to the <hi>Jaums,</hi> as you where taught <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. § 17, 18, 19. and the Angles of the <hi>Door</hi> must be made exactly square, and the <hi>Rabbets</hi> of the <hi>Door</hi> to fit axactly into the <hi>Rabbets</hi> of the <hi>Door-Case.</hi> But yet they commonly make the <hi>Door</hi> about one quarter of an Inch shorter than the insides of the <hi>Jaums</hi> of the <hi>Door-Case,</hi> least if the Boards of the Floor chance to swell within the sweep of the <hi>Door,</hi> the bottom of the <hi>Door</hi> should drag upon the <hi>Floor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They consider what sort of <hi>Hindges</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perest for the <hi>Door</hi> they are to <hi>Hang.</hi> When they have a <hi>Street-door</hi> (which commonly is to take off and lift on) they use <hi>Hooks</hi> and <hi>Hindges.</hi> In a <hi>Battend-door, Back-door,</hi> or other <hi>Battend-door,</hi> or <hi>Shop-windows,</hi> they use <hi>Cross-Garnets.</hi> If a <hi>Framed Door, Side Hindges</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And for <hi>Cup-boards
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1212705000:176"/>
Doors,</hi> and such like, <hi>Duf-tails.</hi> (See the description of these Hindges in <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> 1. 5, 6.) But what sort of Hindges soever they use, they have care to provide them of a strength proportionable to the size and weight of the <hi>Door</hi> they hang with them. Well-made Hindges I have described <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 20. whither to avoid repetition I refer you.</p>
                     <p>If they hang a <hi>Street-door</hi> (which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly about six <hi>foot</hi> high) they first drive the <hi>Hooks</hi> into the <hi>Door-post,</hi> by entring the Post first with an <hi>Augure:</hi> But the <hi>Bit</hi> of the <hi>Augure,</hi> must be less than the Shank of the <hi>Hook,</hi> and the hole boared not so long, because the Shank of the <hi>Hook,</hi> must be strongly forced into the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure-hole, and should the Augure-hole be too wide, the Shank would be loose in it, and not stick strong enough in it. Therefore if the Shank be an Inch square, an half Inch-Augure is big enough to bore that hole with, because it will then endure the heavier blows of an Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to drive it so far as it must go; and the stronger it is forced in, the faster the <hi>Hook</hi> sticks; but yet they are careful not to split the <hi>Door-post.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These <hi>Hooks</hi> are commonly drove in about Fifteen Inches and an half above the <hi>Ground-sell,</hi> and as much below the top of the <hi>Door.</hi> It is, or should be, their care to chuse the Pin of the lower <hi>Hook</hi> about a quarter of an Inch longer than that they use for the upper <hi>Hook</hi> (or else to make it so) because these <hi>Doors</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly unweildy to lift off and on, especially to lift both the Hindges on both the <hi>Hooks</hi> at once. Therefore when the lower Hindge is lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the lower <hi>Hook,</hi> if the <hi>Door</hi> be then lifted perpendicularly upright, so high as the under side of the upper Hindge may just reach the top
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1212705000:177"/>
of the upper <hi>Hook,</hi> you may the easier slip the Eye of the upper Hindge upon the <hi>Hook</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if the lower <hi>Hook</hi> be either shorter, or just no longer than the other, instead of lifting it readily upon the upper <hi>Hook,</hi> you may lift it off the lower <hi>Hook,</hi> and so begin the labour again.</p>
                     <p>Having drove in the <hi>Hooks,</hi> they set the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bets</hi> of the <hi>Door</hi> within the <hi>Rabbets</hi> of the <hi>Door-post,</hi> and underlay the bottom of the <hi>Door,</hi> with a Chip or two about half a quarter of an Inch thick, to raise the <hi>Door</hi> that it drag not. Then they put the Eyes of the Hindges over the Pins of the <hi>Hooks,</hi> and placing the Tail piece of the Hindges parallel to the bottom and top of the <hi>Door,</hi> they so nail them upon.</p>
                     <p>This is the Rule they generally observe for Hanging <hi>Doors, Shop-windows,</hi> &amp;c. Only, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times instead of Nailing the Hindges upon the Door, they <hi>Rivet</hi> them on, for more strength. And then, after they have fitted the Door, or Window, into its Rabbets, and laid the Hindges in there proper place and position (as aforesaid) they make marks in the Nail-holes of the Hindge with the point of their Compasses upon the <hi>Door,</hi> and at those marks they Pierce holes, with a <hi>Piercer-Bit,</hi> that fits the shank of the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet</hi>; then they put the shank of the <hi>Rivet</hi> thro' the holes made in the <hi>Door</hi>; yet so that the Head of the Rivet be on the outside of the <hi>Door</hi>; and they also put the end of the Shank into the Nail-hole of the Hinge, and so whilst another Man holds the head of the Hatchet against the Head of the Rivet, they with the <hi>Pen</hi> of their <hi>Hammer</hi> batter and spread the flat end of the Shank over the Hole, as was shewn <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. <hi>fol.</hi> 24.25.</p>

                        <p>THe <hi>Puppets</hi> are square pieces of Wood, of a Substance convenient to the light or heavy work they intend to <hi>Turn:</hi> And <hi>Turnners</hi> will rather have their <hi>Puppets</hi> too strong than too weak; because, though the <hi>Puppets</hi> be very strong, yet they can turn light work with them; whereas if they be weak they cannot turn Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy work with them: For the weight of heavy unequal tempered Stuff running about, will be apt both to shake the <hi>Puppets,</hi> and loosen the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1212705000:194"/>
small hole of the <hi>Wedge</hi> in the <hi>Tennant</hi>; by either of which Inconveniences the Work in the <hi>Lathe</hi> may tremble, as aforesaid.</p>
                        <p>And though no size for the height of the <hi>Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi> can be well asserted, because of the several Diameters of Work to be <hi>Turned,</hi> yet Workmen generally covet to have their <hi>Puppets</hi> as short as they well can, to bear their Work off the <hi>Cheeks</hi> of the <hi>Lathe,</hi> because these <hi>Puppets</hi> stand in the firmer, and are less subject to loosen. But then, if the Diameters of the work be large, the <hi>Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi> may be too short to <hi>Turn</hi> that work in: For the <hi>Pikes</hi> of the <hi>Puppets</hi> must stand somewhat more than half the Diameter of the Work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the superficies of the <hi>Cheeks.</hi> Therefore <hi>Turners</hi> have commonly two or three pair of <hi>Puppets</hi> to fit one <hi>Lathe,</hi> and always strive to use the shortest they can to serve their Work, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the shortness of the <hi>Legs</hi> of the <hi>Lathe,</hi> makes the work fall too low for the pitch of the Work-man that is to work at the <hi>Lathe.</hi> Therefore in the making of the <hi>Lathe,</hi> the height of the <hi>Legs</hi> with relation to the intended Work, and height of the Work-man, are to be well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                        <p>At the lower end of these <hi>Puppets</hi> are made two <hi>Tennants,</hi> of such a thickness, that they may easily slide in the <hi>Grove</hi> between the two <hi>Cheeks,</hi> and so long, that a <hi>Mortess</hi> through it of the length of the <hi>Cheeks</hi> depth, and a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient strength of Wood below it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Into this <hi>Mortess</hi> is fitted a Tapering-<hi>Wedge,</hi> somewhat less at the fore end, and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at the hinder end than the <hi>Mortess,</hi> that as it is forced into the <hi>Mortess</hi> with a <hi>Mallet,</hi> or a <hi>Maul,</hi> it may draw the bottom Shoulder of the <hi>Puppet</hi> close and firmly down upon the <hi>Cheeks,</hi> that they may neither joggle or tremble in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>BUt when <hi>Turnners</hi> work heavy Work, such as the Pole and <hi>Tread</hi> will not Command, they use the <hi>Great Wheel.</hi> This Wheel is so commonly known, that I shall need give you no other Description of it than the Figure it self, which you may see in <hi>Plate</hi> 14. a. It is turned about with one, and sometimes with two Iron <hi>Handles,</hi> according as the weight of the Work may require.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>String</hi> hath both its ends strong and neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fastned together, not with a Knot, but lapt over one another about three Inches in length<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so is firmly whipt about with small Gut, that it may the easier pass over the narrow <hi>Groove</hi> in the edge of the <hi>Rowler.</hi> This <hi>String</hi> is laid in the <hi>Groove</hi> made on the edge of the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1212705000:203"/>
Wheel, and also in the <hi>Groove</hi> of the Work. But before it is laid upon both, one part of the <hi>String</hi> is lapt over and crosses the other, and the <hi>String</hi> receives the Form of a Figure of Eight (only one of its Bows or Circles becomes no bigger than the <hi>Groove</hi> in the Work, and the other as big as the <hi>Groove</hi> in the <hi>Wheel.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>Then the whole Frame wherein the <hi>Wheel</hi> is fixed is removed farther off the <hi>Lathe,</hi> that the <hi>String</hi> may draw tight upon the Work.</p>
                        <p>The reason why the <hi>String</hi> thus crosses it self, is, because it will touch and gird more upon the <hi>Groove</hi> of the Work, and consequently (as was said before ¶ 14.) will the better command the Work about.</p>
                        <p>The manner of Turning this <hi>Wheel,</hi> is as the manner of Turning other <hi>Wheels</hi> with <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Besides the commanding heavy Work about, the Wheel rids Work faster off than the Pole can do; because the springing up of the Pole makes an intermission in the running about of the Work, but with the <hi>Wheel</hi> the Work runs always the same way; so that the Tool need never be off it, unless it be to examine the work as it is doing.</p>
                        <p>When the Wheel is used, its Edge stands ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wart the <hi>Cheeks</hi> of the <hi>Lathe.</hi>

                        <p>UPon the thin end of the <hi>Pole</hi> is wound a considerable Bundle of <hi>String,</hi> that as a <hi>Mandrel</hi> requires to be bigger than ordinary, or the Work heavier, they may unwind so much of the <hi>String</hi> as will compass the <hi>Mandrel</hi> twice, or (if the Work be heavy) thrice; the easier to carry it about.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>String</hi> is made of the Guts of Beasts (most commonly of Sheep, and spun round of several thicknesses, of which the Workman chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses such sizes as are aptest for his Work; for large and heavy Work, very thick, but for small and light work, thin: And there are several rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for his Choice; for a thin <hi>String</hi> will be too weak for heavy Work; but if it were not too weak for heavy work, it would be apt to mark soft wood more than a thick <hi>String</hi> would, when they are forc'd to shift the <hi>String,</hi> and let it run upon the Work. Besides, a thin <hi>String</hi> (though it were strong enough) would not so well bring heavy Work about; because being small, but little of the <hi>String</hi> touches the wood to command it, unless they wind it the oftner about the Work, which both takes up time, and hazards the breaking of the <hi>String,</hi> by the fretting of the several twists against one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>Now a thick <hi>String</hi> is uncommodious for small work; because having a strength and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornness proportionable to its size, it will not comply closely to a piece of Work of small Diameter, but will be apt to slip about it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less both <hi>Pole</hi> and <hi>Tread</hi> be very strong; and then, if the Center-holes be not very deep, and the <hi>Pikes</hi> fill them not very tight, and the <hi>Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi> also not very well fixt, the strength of the

                     <p>The hollow edge is ground upon the Corner of a <hi>Grind-stone,</hi> which in short time wears the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of that Corner to comply and form with the hollow of the <hi>Gouge.</hi> It is afterwards set upon a round <hi>Whet-stone,</hi> that fits the hollow of the edge, or is somewhat less. But they do not set their <hi>Gouges</hi> or <hi>Chissels</hi> as (I told you in <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. § 10.) the Joyners do; for <hi>Turnners</hi> Tools being somewhat unweldy, by reason of their size, and long Handles, they lay the <hi>Blade</hi> of the <hi>Gouge</hi> with its convex side upon the <hi>Rest</hi> of the <hi>Lathe</hi>; and so with the <hi>Whet-stone</hi> in their right hand they rub upon the <hi>Basil</hi> the <hi>Grind-stone</hi> made, and as they rub, they often turn

another part of the hollow of the edge to bear upon the round of the <hi>Whet-stone,</hi> till they have with the <hi>Whet-stone</hi> taken off the roughness of the <hi>Grind-stone.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Handles</hi> to these <hi>Gouges</hi> (and indeed to all other <hi>Turning Tools</hi>) are not made as the <hi>Handles</hi> of <hi>Joyners</hi> or <hi>Carpenters Tools</hi> are, but tapering towards the end, and so long that the <hi>Handle</hi> may reach (when they use it) under the Arm-pit of the <hi>Work-man,</hi> that he may have more stay and steddy management of the Tool.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Flat Chissels</hi> are marked CC in <hi>Plate</hi> 15. These do the Office of <hi>Smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plains</hi> in <hi>Joyning</hi> and <hi>Carpentry</hi>; for coming after the <hi>Gouges</hi> they cut off the prominent Risings that the <hi>Gouges</hi> leaves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the hollow.</p>
                     <p>The edges of these <hi>Flat Chissels</hi> are not ground to such a <hi>Basil</hi> as the <hi>Joyners Chissels</hi> are, which are made on one of the Flat sides of the <hi>Chis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,</hi> but are <hi>Basil'd</hi> away on both the flat sides; so that the edge lyes between both the sides in the middle of the <hi>Tool:</hi> And therefore either sides of the <hi>Tool</hi> may indifferently be applied to the Work; which could not well be, should the edge lye on one of the sides of the <hi>Tool:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, if they should apply the <hi>Basil</hi> side of the <hi>Tool</hi> to the Work, the thickness of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi> would bear the edge of the <hi>Tool</hi> off: And should they apply that side of the <hi>Tool</hi> the edge lyes on to the <hi>Work,</hi> the swift coming about of the <hi>Work</hi> would (where a small irregularity of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1212705000:211"/>
Stuff should happen) draw or jobb the suddain edge into the Stuff, and so dawk it; which if the Stuff be already small enough, would now be too small, because in <hi>Turnings,</hi> all Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities must be wrought smooth down.</p>
                     <p>Of those <hi>Flat Chissels</hi> there are several sizes, <hi>viz.</hi> from a quarter of an Inch, one Inch, two Inches, to three Inches broad, according to the largness of the <hi>Work.</hi>

                     <p>These are Set with the <hi>Whet-stone</hi> as the <hi>Gouges</hi> are, only they often turn the <hi>Gouges</hi> upon the round side, because they would smoothen all the hollow edge; but these are laid flat upon the Rest, and with a flat <hi>Whet-stone</hi> rubbed on the <hi>Basil,</hi> as the <hi>Gouge</hi> was with the Round.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Hook</hi> is marked D in <hi>Plate</hi> 15. As the <hi>Gouge</hi> is used when the Work lyes before the <hi>Workman,</hi> viz. parallel to its <hi>Axis,</hi> and cuts right forwards, so the <hi>Hook</hi> is used when the <hi>Work</hi> stands on the right or left side the <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> as the flat sides of Boards to be Turned do; and therefore this <hi>Work</hi> may be said to lye ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wart its <hi>Axis.</hi> And the <hi>Hook</hi> is made so as to cut on the right or left side a Board, and to take off the extuberances from the plain of the Board. But though this <hi>Tool</hi> does the Office of a <hi>Gouge,</hi> yet it is more difficult for a <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to use than a <hi>Gouge,</hi> because it is made thinner and slenderer than a <hi>Gouge,</hi> that its edge cutting at a greater Bearing from the <hi>Rest,</hi> may the easier come at the Stuff it works upon, and the farther the edge that cuts lyes from the <hi>Rest</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more difficult it is for a <hi>Workman</hi> to guide it, because it is then more subject to tremble; especially since (as aforesaid) the edge of the <hi>Hook</hi> is and must be thinner than the edge of the <hi>Gouge.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>THere are several fashion'd <hi>Collers</hi>; As the <hi>Joynt-Coller</hi> marked G, the <hi>Round-Coller</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked H, and the <hi>Coller</hi> marked I, in Plate 13.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Joynt-Coller</hi> is made of two Iron <hi>Cheeks</hi> marked <hi>bb,</hi> which moving upon a Joint <hi>c</hi> at the Bottom, may be set close together, or else opened as the two insides of the <hi>Joynt-Rule</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters use to do. On the inner Edge of each <hi>Cheek</hi> is formed as many half-round holes or Semi-circles as you please, or the length of the <hi>Cheeks</hi> will conveniently admit: These Semicir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are made of different Diameters, that they may fit the <hi>Shanks</hi> or <hi>Necks,</hi> of different siz'd <hi>Mandrels:</hi> And these Semi-circles must be made so exactly against each other on the edges of the <hi>Cheeks,</hi> that when the two <hi>Cheeks</hi> moving upon their <hi>Joynt</hi> are clapt close together, the Semi-circles on both the <hi>Cheeks</hi> shall become a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect round hole, or circumference.</p>
                     <p>Near the top of one of these <hi>Cheeks</hi> is fastned with a <hi>Center-pin,</hi> a square Iron Coller marked <hi>d.</hi> with a small <hi>Handle</hi> to it marked <hi>e.</hi> This square Coller is made to contain the breadth of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1212705000:219"/>
both the <hi>Cheeks</hi> when they are shut together, and to hold them so fast together, that they shall not start assunder; and yet is made so fit, that it may slip off and on both the <hi>Cheeks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Joynt-Coller</hi> may serve to do the Office of the other two <hi>Collers,</hi> and its one particular Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice too: Yet to save the Charge of the price of this Tool, <hi>Turners</hi> seldom use them, but make shift with either of the other, or sometimes with a hole made in a Board only: But its particular Office is to hold a <hi>Mandrel,</hi> whose Neck is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to one of its Holes, and the work they are to <hi>Turn</hi> is required to stand out free from the outer Flat of the <hi>Cheeks</hi> of the <hi>Coller,</hi> the better to come at it with the <hi>Tool</hi>; such as are deep Boxes, or deep Cups, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>On the under-side, about the middle of the <hi>Bench,</hi> is fitted and fastned athwart it a square Iron <hi>Coller,</hi> deep enough to reach through the <hi>Cheeks</hi> of the <hi>Lathe,</hi> and so much deeper as it may receive a Wooden <hi>Wedge,</hi> such a one as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to one of the <hi>Puppets:</hi> And by the force and strength of the <hi>Wedge,</hi> the whole <hi>Drill-bench</hi> is drawn down and fastned athwart the <hi>Cheeks</hi> of the <hi>Lathe.</hi>

                     <p>Place therefore your Foot steddy upon the <hi>Treddle,</hi> so far forward as you can, to avoid the <hi>Poles</hi> rising from drawing your Thigh against the underside of the <hi>Lathe</hi>; and Tread the <hi>Treadle</hi> nimbly down, but not quite so low as to knock against the Floor: Then abate the weight of your Tread, and let the <hi>Pole</hi> draw the <hi>Treddle</hi> up, but still keep your Foot steddy, and lightly Bearing upon the <hi>Treddle:</hi> For then your succeeding <hi>Treads</hi> will prove easier to your Leg and Thigh, and you will with your Foot the better and quicker command the <hi>Treddle.</hi> Then <hi>Tread</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain nimbly down as before, and keep this train of Treading till your Work be finish'd, or that you may have occasion to stop and exaime how rightly you proceed.</p>
                     <p>In all small Work the <hi>Tread</hi> is lightly and nimbly performed; but in large and heavy work the <hi>Tread</hi> comes slow and heavily down.</p>
                     <p>This being premised, you may begin with your <hi>Gouge</hi>; lay the round side of it upon the <hi>Rest,</hi> and take the Handle of it in your Right Hand, and lay the Fore and Middle Fingers of your Left Hand upon the Hollow of the <hi>Gouge</hi> near the Work, mounting the Edge about a quarter of an Inch above the <hi>Axis</hi> of your Work, and sinking your Right Hand a little; for in this position the <hi>Gouge</hi> cuts best: And thus cut down on your Work near one end, a <hi>Groove</hi> for your <hi>String</hi> to run in: The <hi>Groove</hi> may be about an Inch, or an Inch and an half long; but it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not much what depth. Then slip your <hi>String</hi> into the <hi>Groove,</hi> and if you find the <hi>String</hi>
                        <pb n="202" facs="tcp:1212705000:228"/>
will not slip easily, you may put your Foot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Treddle</hi> and lift it a little up, that the <hi>String</hi> when no weight is hanged to it, may slide the easier into the <hi>Groove.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And by the way you may take notice, that the deeper you cut down the <hi>Groove,</hi> the oftner will your Work come about every Tread; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>String</hi> that comes down every Tread, measure a small Circumference oftener than it does a greater Circumference: But then the work is not so strongly carried about; because it hath a less portion of the <hi>String</hi> to command it. This I hint, not that in this our small proposed Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern it is very considerable: For if you only cut the <hi>Groove</hi> down but so low as there may be a Shoulder at the end, and another against the Work, to keep the <hi>String</hi> from slipping out of the Groove<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will be sufficient: But in heavy Work this <hi>Groove</hi> ought to be cut with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
                     <p>Now come to the Forming of your Work, and hold your <hi>Gouge,</hi> as you were taught before, but somewhat lightly against your Work, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at one end, and sliding your <hi>Gouge</hi> gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the other, cutting with its Edge all the way you go, and bearing somewhat stiff against the Work every Tread you make on the <hi>Treddle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the Stuff the <hi>Draw-knife</hi> left, even with the smallest part of your Work, you must in like manner (as before) work it over again. But you must have a special Care you take not too much Stuff away on any part of the whole Work: For this proposed Pattern being a <hi>Cilin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> if you take but a small matter to much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from any part, and make it smaller than your given measure there, the whole Work will be spoiled, as being smaller than the proposed Diameter; which to know, you may by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Points of your <hi>Callippers</hi> to two Inches on your <hi>Rule</hi> (the proposed Diameter of your <hi>Cilinder</hi>) try if the Points at that distance will just slip over the deepest <hi>Grooves</hi> of your Work (for we will not suppose that the <hi>Grooves</hi> are of an equal depth with the Rough-working of the <hi>Gouge</hi>) without straining the Joint, for then your Work is just sizeable: If not, work over again as before, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we will now suppose you have not taken too much away, but have made a due process with your <hi>Gouge.</hi> Therefore now proceed, and use a <hi>Flat Chissel,</hi> about an Inch and an half broad, to take off the Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities the <hi>Gouge</hi> left.</p>
                     <p>Take the Handle of it in your Right Hand, as you did the <hi>Gouge,</hi> and claspsing the <hi>Blade</hi> of it in your Left Hand, lean it steddy upon the <hi>Rest,</hi> holding the Edge a little aslant over the Work, so as a Corner of the thin side of the <hi>Chissel</hi> may bear upon the <hi>Rest,</hi> and that the Flat side of the <hi>Chissel</hi> may make a small Angle with the <hi>Rest,</hi> and consequently with the Work; (which is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the <hi>Rest</hi>) for should you set the edge of the <hi>Chissel</hi> parallel to the Work, it might run too fast into the Work, and dawk it. Therefore you must set the <hi>Chissel</hi> in such a position, that the lower, Corner, or near the lower Corner of the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1212705000:230"/>
edge, may cut lightly upon the Work: But this position is best described by a Figure, which to that purpose I have inserted in <hi>Plate</hi> 14. at O, where you may perceive in, or near, what posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Chissel</hi> must be set to cut the Work; and how the edge of the <hi>Chissel ab</hi> lying aslant the Work, and the further Corner of the edge of the <hi>Chissel b</hi> being somewhat mounted, as the Work comes about, the Bottom, or near the Bottom, of the edge of the <hi>Chissel</hi> is only capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to cut a narrow Shaving off the Work: And just in this manner you must keep the <hi>Chissel</hi> steddy bearing upon the Work, as the <hi>Pole</hi> comes down, and withdrawing it from the Work as the <hi>Pole</hi> Springs up (as you were taught to use the <hi>Gouge</hi>) and at the same time sliding it forwards from one end of the Work to the other, till it be wrought down all the way to its true Diameter between the points of the <hi>Callippers</hi>: For then a straight <hi>Ruler</hi> applied to your Work, the outside of your purposes <hi>Cilinder</hi> will be formed.</p>
                     <p>Only the ends must be cut down square to the length: Therefore open the points of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes to the distance of eight Inches on your <hi>Rule,</hi> and prick that distance hard off upon your Work, that the points of your <hi>Compasses</hi> may leave visible marks, by placing one point as near one end as you can, to leave Stuff enough to cut straight down all the way; that is, to cut it square down at right Angles with the outside of the Work. Which to do, you must hold the Handle of the <hi>Flat Chissel</hi> in your Right Hand (as before) and clasp the Blade of it in your Left, and lay one of the thin sides of it upon the <hi>Rest,</hi> so that the edge may stand upright, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near upright against the Work. Then sink your Right Hand somewhat below the Level of the <hi>Rest,</hi> that the lower Corner of the edge of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1212705000:231"/>
the <hi>Chissel</hi> may mount, and being thrust steddy against the Work, just in the mark one Point of the <hi>Compasses</hi> made, Tread the <hi>Treddle,</hi> and cut a pretty deep Circle into the Stuff. But you must have a care you do not direct the cutting Corner of the <hi>Chissel</hi> inwards, but rather out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, lest you make the end hollow instead of Flat: For if you do take off too little at first, you may by degrees cut it down to a Flat after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. As you cut deeper into the Stuff, you must turn the Flat of the <hi>Chissel,</hi> and with it cut down the Shoulder just at the end on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the mark, for else that may hinder the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the edge of the <hi>Chissel</hi> for coming at the Work.</p>
                     <p>Note, That if you hold not the edge of the <hi>Chissel</hi> truly before the Work, but direct it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and if you hold it not very steddy, and have a good guidance of it, the quick coming about of the Work, may draw the edge of the <hi>Chissel</hi> into it inwards and run a dawk on <hi>Cilin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> like the Grooves of a <hi>Screw,</hi> and so spoil your Work: For being once wrought to the true size, you cannot afterwards take any more off to cleanse it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

For this Tool is most commodious to serve you instead of the <hi>Gouge,</hi> when the Work stands athwart the <hi>Pikes</hi>; because the end of the Blade of this Tool being on its Flat side turned into a Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Figure, and that Circular Figure turned a little backwards, one of the Edges of this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Figure will conveniently (though the Tool be not held straight before the Work) come at any part of the Flat of the Board, and so by the Circulation of the Board against the Edge of the <hi>Hook,</hi> cut off its irregular Extube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.</p>
                     <p>In the using of this Tool, you must place the end of the <hi>Handle</hi> under your Arm-pit, and hold your Left Hand on the upper side of the Blade of the Tool close to the <hi>Rest,</hi> and your Right Hand close besides your Left Hand under the Tool, and with both your hands clasp the Tool hard, and press it steddy upon the <hi>Rest,</hi> and at the same time hold it also steddy, and yet light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bearing against the Work, that by the swift coming about of the Work it draw not the Edge of the thin and tender Blade of the <hi>Hook</hi> into it.</p>
                     <p>You must not hold the Blade of this Tool per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly before the Work, <hi>viz.</hi> parallel to the <hi>Pikes,</hi> but aslant, so as somewhat above the middle of the Convex of the <hi>Hook</hi> may touch against the Work. You may begin at the Verge, and so lay several Grooves close by one another
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1212705000:235"/>
till you come to the Center: But you must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve (as was said before in the <hi>Cilinder</hi>) that you lay all your <hi>Grooves</hi> of an equal depth into the Board: For if you lay one deeper than the rest, and an Hollow may not properly be in that place, you must again go over your work with your <hi>Hook,</hi> to work that dawk out: And then perhaps your Board may be made too thin for its intended purpose. But this Craft of the Hand must be acquired with some continued Use and Practice, which will better inform your Judgment what Errours you may be subject to commit, than many words (though significant) upon this Doctrine. And this I'm sure I found, when I first practised upon <hi>Turning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus with the <hi>Hook</hi> rough-plain'd the Board (for this <hi>Hook</hi> does in <hi>Turning</hi> the Office of a <hi>Fore-plain</hi> in <hi>Joynery</hi>) you must use the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular Grooving Tool,</hi> described in Turning § 5. <hi>Plate</hi> 15. and with one of its Edges smoothen down the ridges the <hi>Hook</hi> left on the Board.</p>
                     <p>But if your Work require any Molding near the Verge, or any other part of it, you must work that Molding as near as you can with the <hi>Hook,</hi> especially where Hollows are required; for that cuts faster and smoother than any other Tool, and most artificially forms an Hollow.</p>
                     <p>If a Flat be to be laid in the Board, you must first use the <hi>Triangular Point Tool,</hi> and with it strike so many Threds as the breadth of the Flat requires, and lay each Thred almost so deep into the Board as you intend the Flat shall be: And afterwards to smoothen it down, you must use the <hi>Flat Grooving Tool,</hi> or a <hi>Flat Chissel,</hi> and with either of them finish the Flat to its intended Depth and Breadth. And where a fine Thred, or Circle, is to be laid in the Board,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:1212705000:236"/>
you must use the <hi>Triangular Point Tool.</hi> And thus as you see occasion, you must accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date your self with a Tool apt and proper for your purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> such a Tool as will most conveniently come at, and from the intended Work.</p>

                        <hi>§ XV.</hi> Of Turning <hi>Hard Wood,</hi> and <hi>Ivory.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IF the Wood be very hard, as <hi>Ebony, Lignum Vitae</hi>; or if it be <hi>Ivory, Bone,</hi> or <hi>Horn</hi> they are to Turn; they neither use the same Tools they do for soft Wood; because their edge is to tender: Nor do they use their other Tools as they do soft Wood. For the Tools made for Hard Wood are made with a stronger Point, Edge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than they are for soft, as was said in Turning § 5. And they use them differently, because for Turning Soft Wood, they hold the Edge of the <hi>Gouge</hi> and <hi>Flat Chis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi> at some considerable Distance from the <hi>Rest,</hi> mounting the Edge at such an Angle as will best cut off from the Work, as a great Chip as they can, or desire. And as they Turn the Work smaller, they guide the <hi>Chissel</hi> to follow the Work: But for Hard Wood, they raise the <hi>Rest</hi> near the Horizontal Plain of the <hi>Axis</hi> of the Work, setting it as close as conveniently they can to their Work, and lay their Tool flat and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:1212705000:239"/>
steddy upon the <hi>Rest</hi>; which being hard held in this position, does by the comming about of the Work, cut or tear off all the Extuberances the Tool touches in the sweep of the Work. So that (as I said before) as in <hi>Turning</hi> soft Wood the Tool does somewhat follow the Work; in <hi>Turning</hi> hard Wood the Work comes to the <hi>Tool:</hi> And therefore you may perceive a great reason they have to keep the <hi>Tool</hi> steddy: For should it in one sweep of the Work be thrust nearer the <hi>Axis</hi> in any place, it would there take off more than it should.</p>
                     <p>Having prepared the Work fit for the <hi>Lathe,</hi> either with Hewing, or as some Hard Woods and Ivory may require, with Rasping, they pitch it between the <hi>Pikes,</hi> as before has been shewn, or such Work as it may be, as Boxes, and generally all Hollow Work, they fit into <hi>Collers,</hi> either by screwing the <hi>Mandrel</hi> on an Iron <hi>Axis</hi>; or fitting it with some other of the <hi>Mandrels</hi> described in Turning § 6. as is proper for it: As sometimes they fit the Work tight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an <hi>Hollow Mandrel,</hi> and the tight fitting in holds it whilst it is working upon: And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, if the Work be very thin, they fix it on a <hi>Flat Mandrel</hi> with Cement; But they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways either to chuse one of the <hi>Mandrels</hi> descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed already in Turning § 6. or else contrive (as they often do) some other <hi>Mandrel</hi> conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to the opportunity that accidentally their Business may require. For the Work (whether it be pitcht on the <hi>Pikes,</hi> or fitted into <hi>Hollow Mandrels,</hi> or otherwise) must run very steddy and tight.</p>
                     <p>But having thus fitted it into the <hi>Lathe,</hi> they begin to work with the <hi>Sharp-pointed Grooving Tool,</hi> or else with the <hi>Triangular Groowing Tool,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:1212705000:240"/>
                        <figure/>
                        <pb n="213" facs="tcp:1212705000:241"/>
and with the point of either of these <hi>Tools</hi> break the Grain of the Wood, by laying small Grooves upon its Surface, till they have pretty well wrought away Extuberances, and brought the Work tollerably near an intended shape, by streightning, hollowing, and leaving Risings in their several proper places.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards with edg'd <hi>Grooving Tools</hi> of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Breadth, they cut down and smoothen away the Extuberances left by the <hi>Sharp-pointed Groo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Tool,</hi> or the <hi>Triangular Grooving Tool,</hi> and bring the Work into a perfect shape. Which done, they smoothen the work with the Edge of a piece of a Blade of a broken Knife, basil'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, by following the Work with it: That is, holding the basil'd Edge of the Knife close against the Work while it comes about: For then its sharp Edge scrapes or shaves off the little rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the grosser <hi>Tools</hi> left upon the Work.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, they hold either a piece of Seal-skin or <hi>Dutch</hi> Reeds (whose outer Skin or Filme somewhat finely cuts) pretty hard against the Work, and so make it smooth enough to polish.</p>
                     <p>Hard Wood they polish with <hi>Bees-wax, viz.</hi> by holding <hi>Bees-wax</hi> against it, till it have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently toucht it all over; and press it hard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it by holding hard the edge of a Flat piece of hard Wood made sizable and suitable to the Work they work upon, as the Work is going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. Then they set a Gloss on it with a very dry Woollen Rag, lightly smear'd with <hi>Sallad Oyl.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Ivory</hi> they polish with Chalk and Water, and afterwards dry it with a Woollen Rag, and a light touch of <hi>Sallad Oyl</hi>; which at last they rub off again with a dry Woollen Rag, and so set a Gloss on it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="214" facs="tcp:1212705000:242"/>If there be a Screw to be made upon the thin Edge of an <hi>Ivory,</hi> or <hi>Hard Wood,</hi> or <hi>Brass Box,</hi> they use the <hi>Screw-Mandrel,</hi> and its <hi>Socket,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in Turning 6. ¶ 4. and 5. as is shewn at the latter end of that Section.</p>

                        <hi>§ XVII.</hi> Of the <hi>Brasiers Lathe</hi> and <hi>Turning Tools;</hi> and their manner of using them.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>BRrasiers</hi> that <hi>Turn</hi> Andirons, Pots, Kettles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have their <hi>Lathe</hi> made different from the Common <hi>Turners Lathe,</hi> as you may see in <hi>Plate</hi> 16. at A, where the <hi>Cheeks, Puppets</hi> and <hi>Rests,</hi> &amp;c. are much stronger and the <hi>Pikes</hi> stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and longer than those the common <hi>Turners</hi> use. Their <hi>Edge Tools</hi> which they call <hi>Hooks,</hi> are also of a different shape, as the Figures of them described at B 1, B 2, B 3. in the said <hi>Plate</hi> shew, as being bent backwards and forwards towards the cutting end, somewhat like an z. And as the common <hi>Turners</hi> work with a round <hi>String</hi> made of Gut, as hath been described in Turning § 1. ¶ 14. The <hi>Brasiers</hi> work with a <hi>Flat Leather Thong,</hi> which wrapping close and tight about the <hi>Rowler</hi> of their <hi>Mandrel,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it the easier and more forciably about. Their <hi>Thong</hi> runs between the <hi>Cheeks</hi> of the <hi>Lathe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The whole <hi>Lathe,</hi> and its parts, are made so strong, because the Matter they <hi>Turn</hi> being Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, is much heavier than Wood, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with forciable coming about, would (if the <hi>Lathe</hi> were slight) make it tremble, and so spoil the Work; as hath been said before.</p>
                     <p>The reason why the <hi>Hook</hi> is so turned back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and again forwards, towards the end, is, that they may the better direct the Edge of it as much below the Horizontal Plain of the <hi>Pikes</hi> as they list, the better (in many cases) to come at the Work: For contrary to Soft Wood, Hard Wood and Ivory <hi>Turners,</hi> they always dip the end of their <hi>Hook</hi> below the <hi>Rest,</hi> that so the <hi>Hook</hi> resting very steddy upon the <hi>Rest,</hi> and also against one of the Iron <hi>Pins</hi> standing upright in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1212705000:244"/>
the <hi>Rest,</hi> and held very steddy forwards to the Work, the strong coming about of the Work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the strong Edge of the <hi>Hook,</hi> scrapes off the extuberant Mettle lying in that Sweep.</p>
                     <p>I need no further describe the <hi>Lathe,</hi> and other <hi>Tools</hi> that belong to <hi>Brasiers</hi> Turning; or more of the manner of using them; because, by the whole proceeding Discourse, these Arguments are largely and sufficiently handled; especially considering I have given you the Figures of them in <hi>Plate</hi> 16. as aforesaid.</p>

the <hi>Axis</hi> next the left hand, they with a <hi>Drill-bow</hi> and <hi>Drill-string</hi> carry it about, as was shewn in Smithing <hi>fol.</hi> 6. with this difference, that when a Hole is drill'd in a piece of Mettal, they hold the <hi>Drill-bow</hi> in their Right Hand; but when they <hi>Turn</hi> Small Work, they hold the <hi>Drill-bow</hi> in their Left Hand, and with their Right Hand use the <hi>Tool,</hi> which is commonly a <hi>Graver,</hi> or sometimes a <hi>Sculpter,</hi> fit to such Moldings as are to be made on the <hi>Mettal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They begin to work first with the sharp point of a <hi>Graver,</hi> laying the Blade of it firm upon the <hi>Rest,</hi> and directing the point to the Work, and lay Circles upon it close to one another, till they have wrought it pretty true: Then with one of the broad Edges of the <hi>Graver</hi> they smoothen down what the Point left, and afterwards with <hi>Sculpters, Round</hi> or <hi>Flat,</hi> or great or small, they work their intended Moldings.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>I Had, soon after the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> occasion to lay Moldings upon the Verges of several round and weighty flat pieces of <hi>Brass:</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that time, by reason of the said Fire, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accommodated of a <hi>Lathe</hi> of my own, I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to put them out to be <hi>Turned:</hi> But then <hi>Turners</hi> were all full of Employment, which made them so unreasonable in their Prizes, that I was forc'd to contrive this following way to lay Mold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on their Verges.</p>
                     <p>I provided a strong Iron <hi>Bar</hi> for the <hi>Beam</hi> of a <hi>Sweep:</hi> (For the whole <hi>Tool</hi> marked in <hi>Plate</hi> 16,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1212705000:246"/>
is by Mathematical <hi>Instrument-makers</hi> called a <hi>Sweep.</hi>) To this <hi>Tool</hi> is filed a <hi>Tooth</hi> of Steel with such <hi>Roundings</hi> and <hi>Hollows</hi> in the bottom of it, as I intended to have <hi>Hollows</hi> and <hi>Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> upon my Work: For an Hollow on the <hi>Tooth,</hi> makes a <hi>Round</hi> upon the Work; and a <hi>Round</hi> upon the <hi>Tooth,</hi> makes an <hi>Hollow</hi> on the Work; even as they do in the <hi>Molding-plains Joyners</hi> use. Then I placed the <hi>Center-point</hi> of the <hi>Sweep</hi> in a Center-hole made in a square <hi>Stud</hi> of <hi>Mettal,</hi> and fixed in the <hi>Center</hi> of the Plain of the Work; and removed the <hi>Socket</hi> that rides on the <hi>Beam</hi> of the <hi>Sweep,</hi> till the <hi>Tooth</hi> stood just upon its intended place on the Verge of the Work, and there screw'd the <hi>Socket</hi> fast to the <hi>Beam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To work it out, I employ'd a Labourer, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting him in his Left Hand to hold the Head of the <hi>Center-pin,</hi> and with his Right Hand to draw about the <hi>Beam</hi> and <hi>Tooth,</hi> which (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the strength) he us'd, cut and tore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way great Flakes of the <hi>Mettal,</hi> till it receiv'd the whole and perfect Form the <hi>Tooth</hi> would make; which was as compleat a Molding as any Skillful <hi>Turner</hi> could have laid upon it.</p>
                     <p>Having such good Success upon <hi>Brass,</hi> I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd the invention so, as to make it serve for Wood also. And make a <hi>Plain-Stock</hi> with my intended Molding on the <hi>Sole</hi> of it, and fitted an <hi>Iron</hi> to that <hi>Stock</hi> with the same Molding the <hi>Sole</hi> had.</p>
                     <p>Through the sides of this <hi>Stock</hi> I fitted an Iron <hi>Beam,</hi> to do the Office of the <hi>Beam</hi> I used for the <hi>Sweep,</hi> viz. to keep the Plain always at what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition I listed from the Center (for thus the Iron in the Plain wrought about the Center, even as the Tooth in the <hi>Sweep</hi> (before rehearsed) and to that purpose I made a round Hole of about
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1212705000:247"/>

                     <p>You must use an <hi>Hollow-Mandrel,</hi> made fit stifly to receive the convexity of the <hi>Globe</hi> in its concavity, so as it may stick firmly in the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel,</hi> in its position: And you must take care that in pitching the <hi>Globe</hi> into the <hi>Mandrel,</hi> that the imaginary <hi>Axis</hi> of the <hi>Globe</hi> (which is the Line passing between the two Centers of the two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite Circles as aforesaid) lye in a straight Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Having thus pitcht the <hi>Globe</hi> true, and fixt it fast into the <hi>Mandrel,</hi> you must begin to work with the <hi>Triangular Grooving Point</hi> (described in Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning § 5. and <hi>Plate</hi> 15.) placing the point of it pretty near the Center of the Circle, and work into the <hi>Ball</hi> with the <hi>Grooving Point,</hi> and so by degrees make a Hollow in the <hi>Ball</hi> so deep, and so wide, as you think convenient, I mean so deep from the Superficies of the <hi>Globe</hi> towards the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Globe,</hi> and so wide from the Center of the Circle described on the Superficies of the

                        <hi>Globe</hi> towards that Circle, as it may have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Substance between this Hole, and the next intended to be <hi>Turned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus must every one of the eight Circles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed on the <hi>Globe,</hi> be successively by the same Rule, and after the same manner be pitcht out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and fixt into the <hi>Mandrel,</hi> and then Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed out as the first was. Where Note, That every Hollow is to be <hi>Turned</hi> to the same depth and width exactly as the first was: Which to do, you must use a <hi>Gage</hi> made of a thin Plate of Iron or Brass, as is described in <hi>Plate</hi> 17. <hi>Fig.</hi> D. whose two sides from <hi>a</hi> the Bottom of the <hi>Gage,</hi> to <hi>b</hi> the <hi>Shoulder</hi> are the depth of the <hi>Hollow</hi> from the Superficies of the <hi>Globe</hi> towards the Center: <hi>bb.</hi> is the width of the <hi>Hollow</hi> at the Superficies of the <hi>Globe</hi>; and <hi>aa</hi> is the bottom width of the <hi>Hollow</hi>; and the concave Arch between <hi>aa</hi> is an Arch that the Convexity of the little solid <hi>Ball</hi> to be <hi>Turned</hi> within all the <hi>Spheres</hi> must comply with. So that when each <hi>Hollow</hi> is <hi>Turned,</hi> the <hi>Gage</hi> must be put into it to try how the sides of the <hi>Hollow</hi> complies with the sides of the <hi>Gage,</hi> and also how the Arch in the bottom of the <hi>Gage,</hi> complies with the surface of the Solid <hi>Ball</hi> in the middle.</p>
                     <p>Having thus <hi>Turned</hi> all the <hi>Hallows</hi> in the <hi>Globe,</hi> you must provide several thin and narrow Arching <hi>Grooving Tools,</hi> whose convex and concave Arches comply both with the Convexity and Concavity of each <hi>Globe,</hi> or <hi>Sphere,</hi> to be <hi>Turned</hi> within the outermost: So that begining at the bottom of the Hollow, you Turn just half way of the Solid <hi>Ball</hi> loose from the Sphere it is contained in, <hi>viz.</hi> as far as the Equinoctial of the <hi>Globe</hi>; and in thus Turning it, you must take great care, that the Solid Ball on its Convexity and the Concavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Sphere it is contained in, be both at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>IN the middle of the <hi>Puppet</hi> is hollowed out a Hole about three Inches between the Fore and Back-side of the <hi>Puppet,</hi> and four Inches athwart the <hi>Cheeks</hi> in the <hi>Puppet,</hi> and four Inches deep: So that about an Inch of Substance remains on each of the four upright sides. But the Top is quite open, (as at <hi>a</hi>) through the middle of this square <hi>Hole</hi> runs the Iron <hi>Axis</hi> marked <hi>bb,</hi> on which is fixed the several <hi>Guides</hi> that are to be used in this sort of Working.</p>
                        <p>It is open at the Top, that Light may be let in to set the <hi>Guide-pulley</hi> to which <hi>Guide</hi> you please, and it is open on the hither side as at <hi>ee,</hi> about an Inch and an half above and below the <hi>Axis,</hi> that the <hi>Guide-pulley</hi> may be slid on its <hi>Axis</hi> to any of the <hi>Guides.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Guide-pulley</hi> marked <hi>d,</hi> is a brass Pulley of about an Inch Diameter, and a little above a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Inch thick, having a <hi>Groove</hi> in the Edge of it to receive the Edge of the <hi>Guide.</hi> It hath in its middle a round Hole about half an

Inch Diameter, which round Hole slips over a round Iron <hi>Pin</hi> of the same Diameter, marked <hi>ff,</hi> so as it may slide from one end of the said Iron <hi>Pin</hi> to the other, according as the <hi>Guides</hi> may be fixed towards either end.</p>
                        <p>When it is used, the Groove in the Edge of this <hi>Guide-pulley</hi> is set against the Edge of the <hi>Guide,</hi> and being fitted tight on the round Iron <hi>Pin</hi> aforesaid, and the two ends of the Iron Pin fast fixed into the Wood of the <hi>Puppet,</hi> the <hi>Guide-pulley</hi> may indeed move round on the Iron <hi>Pin</hi>; but the strength of the Iron <hi>Pin,</hi> and <hi>Guide-pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> will resist the extuberick parts of the Edge of the <hi>Guide</hi>; and so with the assistance of the strength of the <hi>Steel Bow</hi> force the <hi>Guide</hi> and <hi>Hollow Axis</hi> to move backwards; and then an Edge-Tool held to the Work in the <hi>Mandrel</hi> screwed in the <hi>Hollow Axis,</hi> will describe the same Figure on the Work, as is on the out Edge of the <hi>Guide.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Note, that when you are at Work, you must keep the Hole in the middle of the <hi>Guide-pulley</hi> well oyl'd, as also the round Iron <hi>Pin</hi> it slides and turns round upon; because this <hi>Guide-pulley</hi> ought to run round: For then the <hi>Axis</hi> will have and easier and swifter motion, tho' it may indeed perform the Work if it run not round upon the Iron Pin.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>TO the Turning of <hi>Swash-work</hi> you must have two such <hi>Puppets,</hi> as the <hi>Fore-puppet</hi> described in § 22. And also a round <hi>Swash-board,</hi> about ten Inches Diameter, and an Inch and an half thick, as is <hi>a</hi> in Fig. B. <hi>Plate</hi> 18. Upon both the flat sides of this <hi>Swash-board,</hi> in a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Line, is fastned upright an Arch of a Quadrant made of a Steel Plate, about half a quarter of an Inch thick, and an Inch and a quarter broad, as at <hi>bb, cc.</hi> The Convex edges of these Quadrants are cut into Notches, like the Teeth of an Hand-saw; that according as you may have occasion to set the <hi>Swash-board</hi> more or less a-slope, you may be accommodated with a Notch or Tooth to set it at. This <hi>Swash-board</hi> hath an Hole made about its Center, to slip o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Iron Axis,</hi> and being thus slipt over the <hi>Iron Axis,</hi> you set it to that Slope you intend the <hi>Swash</hi> on your Work shall have. And to fix it fast in this position, you must put the Blades of the Quadrants into two <hi>Slits,</hi> made in the <hi>Iron Axis</hi> as at <hi>dd,</hi> and fit the two opposite Teeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the two outer Shoulders of the <hi>Slits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You must moreover make two strong Steel <hi>Springs</hi> as at <hi>cc,</hi> to reach from the bottom of the outer sides of the <hi>Puppets,</hi> being strong nailed, or rather screwed down there, which must reach up so high as the <hi>Axis.</hi> And in the inner sides of these <hi>Springs</hi> must be made two Center holes for the points of the <hi>Axis</hi> to be fitted in: For the <hi>Oval-Guide</hi> being fitted to one end of the <hi>Axis,</hi> and a Low-Puppet, as at <hi>f,</hi> wedged close to one side of the <hi>Swash-board,</hi> when the <hi>Swash-board</hi> stands in its greatest declirity; then in a Revolution of the <hi>Axis,</hi> as the farther part of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1212705000:261"/>
the circumference of the <hi>Swash-board</hi> comes to the <hi>Low-Puppet,</hi> one <hi>Spring</hi> will be forced back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and the other will spring forwards; and an Edg'd-Tool held against the Work fixed on the <hi>Axis,</hi> will make on the Work the Form of a <hi>Swash,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>These <hi>Oval-Engines, Swash-Engines,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Engines,</hi> are excellently well made by Mr. <hi>Thomas Oldfield,</hi> at the sign of the <hi>Flower-de-luce,</hi> near the <hi>Savoy</hi> in the <hi>Strand, London.</hi>

                     <p>There are also in most Counties of <hi>England,</hi> Bricks made for the Paving of <hi>Floors</hi> of <hi>Rooms, Cellers, Dary-houses,</hi> &amp;c. which are made of a stronger sort of Earth, than the common <hi>Bricks</hi> for Building, the <hi>Earth</hi> being a kind of <hi>Clay,</hi> and in some Countries are called <hi>Clay Bricks,</hi> which are dearer than the <hi>Ordinary Bricks</hi> by about six Shillings in a Thousand.</p>

                     <p>The first sort are called <hi>Plains Tiles,</hi> being made of a strong sort of Earth like <hi>Clay</hi>; and are, or should be ten Inches and an half in length, in breadth six Inches and a Quarter, and in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness three quarters of an Inch.</p>
                     <p>The second sort are <hi>Gutter</hi> or <hi>Hip Tiles,</hi> which are used sometimes for <hi>Vallies</hi> and <hi>Hips</hi> of <hi>Rooffs,</hi> altho' here at <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Vallies</hi> are commonly tiled with <hi>Plain Tiles,</hi> and the <hi>Hips</hi> with <hi>Ridge,</hi> or (as some call them) <hi>Roof Toiles:</hi> These <hi>Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Tiles</hi> are in length ten Inches and an half, with convenient breadth and thickness accordingly, and are made Circular or hollow, and wider at one end than at the other.</p>
                     <p>The third sort are <hi>Ridge</hi> or <hi>Roof Tiles,</hi> being in length thirteen Inches, and made Circular breadthways like an half Cylinder, whose Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter is about ten Inches, or more, and about half an Inch and half a quarter in thickness: These are laid upon the upper parr, or ridge of the Roof, and also on the Hips.</p>
                     <p>The fourth sort are <hi>Pan-Tiles,</hi> being about thirteen Inches long, with a Nob or Button to hang on the Laths, and are made hollow or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular breadthways, being eight Inches in breadth, and about half an Inch in thickness, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more.

                     <head>Of Lime.</head>
                     <p>THere are two sorts, one made of Stone, which is the strongest, and the other of Chalk, both sorts being burnt in a <hi>Kilne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Lime that is made of soft Stone or Chalk is useful for Plastering of Seelings and Walls within Doors, or on the insides of Houses; and that made of hard Stone, is fit for Structures or Buildings, and Plastering without Doors, or on the out side of Buildings that lies in the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that which is made of greasy clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Stone, is stronger than that made of lean poor Stone; and that which is made of spongy Stone, is lighter than that made of firm and close stone; that is again more Commodious for Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering, this for Building.</p>
                     <p>Also very good <hi>Lime</hi> may be made of <hi>Mill-stone,</hi> not course and Sandy, but fine and Greasy.</p>
                     <p>Likewise of all kinds of Flints (but they are hard to burn except in a <hi>Reverbratory Kilne</hi>) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept those that are roled in the Water, because a great part of its increase goes away by a kind of Glass.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Lime</hi> also is useful in divers things, for 'tis use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Oyles and Wines, and good to Manure Land with; some season new Wine with it, mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigating the unpleasantness of the Wine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
                     <p>Moreover <hi>quick Lime</hi> being cast into an arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Vault, and Water thrown upon it, consumes dead Bodies put therein.</p>
                     <p>Also <hi>Diers</hi> and <hi>Tanners,</hi> and likewise <hi>Physicians</hi> use it, but they choose the newest, to wit, that which is newly drawn out of the <hi>Kiln,</hi> and not slack'd with Water or Air.</p>
                     <p>It will burn so vehemently, that it makes crusts, and will fire Boards or Timber against which it lies; but being slackt for sometime, it burns no more, yet it warms and dries, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves Flesh; and being washed three or four times, it Bites or Eats not, but dries quickly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lime</hi> mixt with Sand is much used in Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and <hi>Vitruvius</hi> says, That you may put three parts of Sand that is digged (or pit Sand) and one part of <hi>Lime</hi> to make <hi>Morter</hi>; but if the Sand be taken out of a <hi>River,</hi> or out of the <hi>Sea</hi>

                     <p>Here at <hi>London,</hi> where for the most part our <hi>Lime</hi> is made of <hi>Chalk,</hi> we put about thirty six Bushels of Pit-Sand, to twenty five Bushels o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Moreover there is other <hi>Morter</hi> used in making of Water-courses, Cisterns, Fish-ponds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is very hard and durable, as may be seen at <hi>Rome,</hi> at this day, which is called <hi>Maltha,</hi> from a kind of <hi>Bitumen</hi> Dug there; for as they build most firm Walls thereof naturally, so they use it in making of Cisterns to hold Water, and all manner of Water-works; and also in finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Plastering of Fronts to represent Stone.</p>
                     <p>And I find two kinds of Artifices used by the Antients, both of which is compounded of <hi>Lime</hi> and <hi>Hogs-grease,</hi> but to one is added the Juice of Figs, and to the other <hi>Liquid Pitch</hi>; and the Lumps of <hi>Lime</hi> are first wet or slack'd with Wine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then pounded or beat with <hi>Hogs-grease,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In latter times, two kinds of <hi>Cement</hi> are in use, in both which they use the Powder of <hi>Marble,</hi> or other <hi>Stone,</hi> to one is added the Whites of Eggs, to the other is added <hi>Pitch</hi>; to these some add other things, as the Gravers of <hi>Gems,</hi> they make it of <hi>Tile Dust</hi> and <hi>Pitch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another Material which <hi>Bricklayers</hi> use are <hi>Laths,</hi> which are made of heart of <hi>Oak,</hi> for out side Work, as <hi>Tiling</hi> and <hi>Plastering</hi>; and of <hi>Fir</hi> for inside <hi>Plastering</hi> and <hi>Pantile Lathing</hi>; their usual lengths being 5 Foot, and 4 Foot, and sometimes longer or shorter; their Breadth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 2 Inches, and one Inch and an half, the thickness about ¼ of an Inch or thicker: But for <hi>Pantiling,</hi> the <hi>Laths,</hi> are about ten Foot long, one Inch and half Broad, and half an Inch or more thick.</p>
                     <p>Another Material is <hi>Nails,</hi> of which they use three sorts, one is called, <hi>Reparation</hi> or <hi>Lath Nails,</hi> which are used for plain <hi>Tile Lathing,</hi> and outside and inside <hi>Lathing</hi> for Plastring; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother sort are four Penny, and six Penny Nails, used for <hi>Pantile Lathing</hi>; and a third sort are great Nails for Scaffolding.</p>
                     <p>Moreover they use <hi>Tile-Pins,</hi> which are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made of <hi>Oak,</hi> and sometimes of <hi>Fir,</hi> which they drive into holes that are made in the <hi>Plain Tiles</hi> to hang them upon their <hi>Lathing.</hi>

                     <p>The finishing Morter to represent Stone, should be made of the strongest Lime, and the sharpest Sand you can get, which Sand must be washed in a large Tub, very well, till no Scum or Filth arise in the Water, when you stir it about, which sometimes will require to have Water 5 or 6 times, when the Sand is somewhat foul; and it requires a greater Proportion of Sand than the ordinary Morter, because it must be extreamly beaten, which will break all the knots of <hi>Lime,</hi> and by that means it will require more Sand.</p>

                     <head>And first of Foundations.</head>
                     <p>'TIs usual, and also very convenient, for any person before he begins to Erect a Building, to have Designs or Draughts drawn upon Paper or Vellum, and also if it be a large Building, to have a Model of it made in Wainscot; in which Designs and Model, the Ground Plat or Ichnography of each Floor or Story, is deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and represented: As also the fashion and form of each Front, together with the Windows, Doors, and Ornaments, if they intend any, to wit, <hi>Facias, Rustick Quines, Architraves, Friezes</hi> and <hi>Cornices,</hi> are to be shewn in the Draughts or Designs of the Uprights or <hi>Orthographyes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If more Fronts than one be shewn <hi>Perspectively</hi> in one Draught, then 'tis called <hi>Scenography,</hi> which is not easily understood, except by those who understand the Rules of <hi>Perspective.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore it will be more Intelligible to the several Workmen, to have a Draught of each Front in a Paper by it self, and also to have a Draught of the Ground-Plat or <hi>Ichnography</hi> of every story, in a Paper by it self; because many times the Conveniences, or Contrivances in one Story, differs from those in another, either in bigness of Chimneys, or division of the Rooms, some being larger in one Story than another, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:1212705000:284"/>
sometimes having more Chimnies in one Story than in another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All which things being well considered, and drawn on Papers, or a Model made thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Building is begun, there will be no need of Alterations, or Tearing and pulling the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pieces after it is begun; for besides the hindrance of the Procedure of the Work, it makes the Building lame and Deficient, nothing being so well done, when 'tis put up, and pulled down, and set up again, as if it were well done at first.</p>
                     <p>Besides it makes the Workmen uneasy, to see their Work, in which they have taken a great deal of pains, and used a great deal of Art, to be pull'd to pieces.</p>
                     <p>The drawing of Draughts is most commonly the work of a Surveyor, although there be many Master Workmen that will contrive a Building, and draw the Designs thereof, as well, and as curiously, as most Surveyors: Yea, some of them will do it better than some Surveyors; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>And now concerning the <hi>Foundations.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AFter the Cellars are dug, if there are to be any, or if none, after the Trenches are dug, in which the Walls are to stand; the Master-Bricklayer, or else his Foreman (which ought to be an ingenious Workman) must in the first place try all the Foundations, in several places, with an Iron Croe, and Rammer, or, indeed, with a Borer (such as Well-Diggers use, to try what Ground they have to produce Water) to see whether the <hi>Foundations</hi> are all sound, and fit to bear the Weight which is to be set upon them. If he find any part of the <hi>Foundations</hi> defective, he ought to dig it deeper till he comes to firm ground; or if it proves to be loose, or made Ground to a great depth, then he must take care to make it good and sufficient to carry its Weight by Art, which may be done several ways.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> If the <hi>Foundation</hi> be not very lose, and insufficient, it may be made good, by ramming
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:1212705000:286"/>
in great Stones with a heavy Rammer, the Stones being placed close together, and about a foot wider on each side of the Trench than the width of the Wall is to be; because all Walls ought to have a Basis, or Footing, at least 4 Inches on a side broader than the thickness of the Wall; which Stones being well rammed, and the Basis being 8 Inches more in breadth than the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Wall, and this 8 Inches being set off, about one Inch, or one Inch and an half at a time on both sides (that so the middle of the Wall may stand on the middle of the Basis) may make the Foundation good, and able to bear its Burden.</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Foundation</hi> be somewhat worse than as aforesaid, then he must get good pieces of Oak, whose length must be the breadth of the Trench, or about two foot longer than the breadth of the Wall, which must be laid cross the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> about foot asunder, and being well ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med down, lay long Planks upon them, which planking need not be the length of the cross pieces, but only 4 Inches of a side wider than the Basis, or footing of the Wall is to be, and pin'd or spiked down to the pieces of Oak on which they lye.</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Foundations</hi> be so bad that this will not do, then he must provide good Piles made of Heart of Oak, of such a length as will reach ground, whose Diameter must be about 1/12 part of their length, which must be drove or forced down with a Commander, or an Engin for that purpose, and then lay long Planks upon them, and spike or pin the Planks to them, and the closer together that these Piles are drove the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it will be.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="256" facs="tcp:1212705000:287"/>Moreover, if the <hi>Foundation</hi> be faulty but in here and there a place, and there be good Ground in the other parts of it, you may turn Arches o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver those insufficient places, which will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and take off the weight from the loose places.</p>
                     <p>And when you make these Arches to shun the difficulty of the Earth, and to save the charge of Expence, they must be made of Bricks and Morter that are very good, and be well wrought, that they do neither settle nor give way.</p>
                     <p>You may observe for the greater strength of these Arches, or Discharges, to make them high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than a Semicircle, or half round, if the Work will admit of it, and to make the same, of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Arches: As in <hi>Plate</hi> 3. <hi>Fig.</hi> 4. you may see, they are described from an Equilateral Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle; that is to say, supposing the breadth of the Arch between the Piers to be <hi>AB</hi>; with this width, and from the points <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B,</hi> make the two Portions of the Arches <hi>AC</hi> and <hi>BC</hi>; this rising so high, adds great strength to the Arches to resist, or carry the Weight which they are to bear.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Architect <hi>Leon Baptista Albert</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises, when the Earth on which we would make Pillars or Piers is of equal resistance, that is to say, not good, to turn Arches inversed, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side down, and says, by this means one Pillar shall bear no more weight than another, when the Earth that is underneath is not so strong, or that it bears more than another part; which he doth thus.</p>
                     <p>Having wrought up the Pillars, or Piers, as high as is necessary from the <hi>Foundation,</hi> make from these Piers inverse Arches, as <hi>ABC</hi> in <hi>Plate</hi> 3. <hi>Fig.</hi> 5. whose Joints tend to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>D.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="257" facs="tcp:1212705000:289"/>By this construction he pretends for Example, that if the Pier <hi>F</hi> hath a worse <hi>Foundation,</hi> or hath a greater Weight, that is to say, is more charged than the other Piers, this charge, or weight, will be stopped, or stayed by the Inverse Arches <hi>ABC, IHK,</hi> because the Earth which is under these Arches keeps the Piers in the same height, that is to say, that they shall not sink.</p>
                     <p>But he must also suppose that this Earth is as firm as that of the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the Piers, or at least it must be made so.</p>
                     <p>The Ingenious Surveyor Mr. <hi>Hook,</hi> made use of this Artifice, as I am informed, in building the Lord <hi>Montague</hi>'s brave House in <hi>Bloomsbury,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> and where he was then Surveyor.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Foundation</hi> being all made firm, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, the Master-Bricklayer, or his Foreman, must take care to see all the <hi>Foundations</hi> set tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out, according to the design of the Ground-plat, or Cellar-floor, and that all his Walls be made of the same thickness as they are in the Design; which is very difficult to do, to wit, to take the true thickness of the Walls from a Design that is drawn to a small Scale, because the breadth of the Points of the Compasses will vary somewhat; therefore 'tis advisable for him that draws the Draught, to set the Dimensions in Figures to each Wall, Chimney, Window, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then the Workman cannot so easily make a Mistake.</p>
                     <p>And because the well-working and bonding of Brick-walls conduces very much to their strength, I will here add some some necessary Rules to be observed in the laying of Bricks, to make the Walls and strong and durable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:1212705000:290"/>
                        <hi>First.</hi> That the Morter be made of well burnt good Lime, and sharp Sand, and that it have a due proportion of Sand, that is to say, if it be very sharp, a Load of Sand, being about 36 Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shels, is sufficient for an Hundred of Lime, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 25 Bushels, or an hundred Pecks, (for I imagine that the word <hi>Hundred of Lime</hi> is used, because it contains an Hundred Pecks, and that in Old Time they used to sell it by the Peck, but now by the Bushel) to wit, to one Bushel of Quick Lime, a Bushel and half of Sand.</p>
                     <p>But if the Sand be not very sharp, then you may put a greater quantity of Sand, for Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which hath its due proportion of Sand, is stronger than that which hath less Sand in it, altho' some think otherwise.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> When you slack the Lime, take care to wet it every where a little, but do not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wet it, and cover with Sand every laying, or bed of Lime, being about a Bushel at a time as you slack it up, that so the Stream, or Spirit of the Lime, may be kept in, and not flee away, but mix it self with the Sand, which will make the Morter much stronger, than if you slack all your Lime first, and throw on your Sand alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at last, as some use to do.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That you beat all your Morter with a Beater three or four times over before you use it, for thereby you break all the Knots of Lime that go through the Sieve, and incorporate the Sand and Lime well together, and the Air which the Beater forces into the Morter at every stroak, conduces very much to the strength thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="259" facs="tcp:1212705000:291"/>If I might advise any one that is minded to build well, or use strong Morter for Repairs, I would have them beat the Morter well, and let it lie 2 or 3 Days, and then beat it well again when 'tis to be used.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If you lay bricks in hot dry Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and be it some small piece of Work that you would have very strong, dip every Brick you lay, all over in a Pale of Water, which will make the Wall much stronger than if the Bricks were laid dry: The reason why I mention a small piece of Work is, because 'tis a great deal of trouble to wet them for much Work, or a whole Building, and besides it makes the Workmen's Fingers sore; to prevent which, they may throw Pales of Water on the Wall after the Bricks are lay'd, as was done at the building of <hi>Physicians College</hi> in <hi>Warwick-Lane,</hi> by order of the Surveyor, which was the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Ingenious Mr. <hi>Hook,</hi> if I mistake not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Cover all your Walls in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-time to keep them from drying too hastily, for the Morter doth not Cement so str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ngly to the Bricks when it dries hastily, as when slowly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Be sure to cover them very well in the Winter-time, to preserve them from Rain, Snow and Frost, which last is a great Enemy to all kinds of Morter, especially to that which hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aken wet just before the Frost.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> In working up the Walls of a Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, do not work any Wall above 3 foot high before you work up the next adjoining Wall, that so you may join them together, and make
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1212705000:292"/>
good Bond in the Work: For 'tis an ill Custom among some <hi>Bricklayers,</hi> to carry, or work up a whole Story of the Party-walls, before they work up the Fronts, or other Work adjoining, that should be bonded or worked up together with them, which occasions Cracks and Setlings in the Walls.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eightly,</hi> Take care that you do not lay Joint on Joint, in the middle of the Walls as seldom as may be, but make bond there as well as on the outsides; for I have seen some, who in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Brick and half Wall, have laid the Header on one side of the Wall, upright upon the Header on the other side of the Wall, and so all along through the whole course, which indeed necessarily follows from the inconsiderate setting up of the Quine at a Toothing; for 'tis common to Tooth in the stretching course two Inches with the Stretcher only, and the Header on the other side, to be set upright upon the Header on this side, which causes the Headers to lye Joint in Joint in the middle of the Wall, as in <hi>Plate</hi> 3. <hi>Fig.</hi> 1. you may see.</p>
                     <p>Whereas if the Header of one side of the Wall, toothed as much as the Stretcher on the other side, it would be a stronger Toothing, and the Joints of the Headers of one side, would be in the middle of the Headers of the course they lye upon of the other side, as in <hi>Plate</hi> 3. <hi>Fig.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>All that can be said for this ill Custom of working, is this, that the Header will not well hang two Inches over the Bricks underneath it; I grant it will not, but then it may be made, by having a piece of Fir, or any other Wood of the thickness of a Course of Bricks, and two
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:1212705000:293"/>
Inches broad, and lay it on the last Toothing Course to bear it; or a <hi>Bat,</hi> put upon the last Toothing, will bear it till the next <hi>Quine</hi> is set upon it, and then the <hi>Bat</hi> may be taken away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ninthly,</hi> The same Inconveniency happens at an upright <hi>Quine</hi> in a <hi>Brick</hi> and half Wall, where 'tis usual to lay a Closier next the Header on both sides of the Wall, and in so doing 'tis Joint in Joint all the length of the Wall, except by chance a three quartern Bat happen to be laid.</p>
                     <p>To prevent which Inconveniency, and to make the Wall much stronger, lay a Closure on one side, and none on the other; but lay a three quarter Bat at the Quine in the stretching course, and in the Heading course adjoin an Header next to the Header at the Quine, as you may see it done in Plate 3. <hi>Fig.</hi> 1. and 2.</p>
                     <p>Where A and B in both Figures or Diagrams, represents a Brick and half Wall, having an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Quine at A, and a Toothing at B, and the Prick Lines represents the Course of Bricks laid upon the other course; so in <hi>Fig.</hi> 1. the black Lines next you are an heading course, and the Prick-lines next you, shew a Stretching course; And on the further side from you, the black Lines shew a stretching course, and the Prick-Lines an Heading course.</p>
                     <p>In which <hi>Fig.</hi> 1. is shewn the usual way of bad Working, but in <hi>Fig.</hi> 2. is shewn the true way it should be wrought, to be made firm and strong.</p>
                     <p>Also in working a two Brick Wall, I would advise in the Stretching courses, wherein you lay stretching on both sides the Wall next the Line, so also to lay stretching in the middle of the Wall, and Closiers next to each stretching Course that lies next the Line, as in <hi>Fig.</hi> 3. of <hi>Plate</hi> 3. you may see.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="262" facs="tcp:1212705000:294"/>Where the Diagram or Fig. AB, signifies a two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>We will suppose an Ellipsis Arch to be made over a Chimny, whose Diameter between the Jambs is eight feet, and the under side of the Arch at the Key to rise in height 18 Inches from the level of the place, whence you begin to spring the Arch; the height or depth of the Arch we will suppose to be made of the length of two Bricks, which when they are cut to the sweep of the Arch, will not contain above 14 Inches, and perhaps you must Cement pieces to many of the Courses in the Hanse to make them long enough to contain, or hold 14 Inches, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if you intend to make the Courses of the Hanse, and the Courses of the Scheam to seem alike in greatness, on the under side of the Arch; For if you make the Hanse to come to a true Sommering for the Scheam, by that time that
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:1212705000:311"/>
you have ended the Hanse, and are ready to set the first Courses of the Scheam: The Mould, and so likewise each Course in the Hanse, will be much less at the lower part, or under side of the Arch, than the Mould, or Courses of the Scheam, as you may perceive by the Hanse BK, in the 3d. <hi>Fig.</hi> which way of working these kind of Arches is stronger, than to make the Courses seem alike in bigness in Hanse and Scheam, although it be not so pleasing to the eye. In the 3d. <hi>Fig.</hi> I will shew how to make one half of the Arch this way, and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther half shew how to make the Courses in Hanse and Scheam of a bigness.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Describe the under side of the Arch, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Ellipsis ADB, whose Diameter AB is eight feet, and the height CD 18 Inches) upon some smooth Floor, or streight plaistered Wall, or such like; then continue (<hi>viz.</hi> draw longer) both the lines AB, CD, cutting each other at right Angles, then from A to E, also from B to F, likewise from D to G, set 14 Inches, the intended height of your Arch. Then describe another Ellipsis to that length and height, after this manner; lay a streight Ruler on the Centre by I, and on the joining of the Hanse, and the Scheam together, as at K, and draw the line KL, then set one point of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes in the centre of the Hanse at M, and open the other point of the Compasses to F, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the upper Hanse FL, likewise setting one point of the Compasses in the centre by I, with the other extended to G, describe the Scheam GL, (although I speak here of Compasses, yet when you describe an Arch to its full big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, you must make use of centre Lines or
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:1212705000:312"/>
Rules; the last are best, because Lines are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to stretch) then taking between your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes the thickness of a Brick, abating some small matter which will be rub'd off from both beds of the Brick; with the Compasses at this distance divide the upper Hanse from L to F into equal parts, and if they happen not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it into equal parts, then open them a small matter wider, or shut them a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter closer, till it doth divide it into equal parts, and look how many equal parts you divide the upper Hanse into, so many equal parts you must divide the lower Hanse from K to B into likewisewise (or you may divide the upper Hanse from the centre O, making a right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle from each sommering Line to the Ellipsis, as is shewn in describing the streight Arches fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; and from the centre O, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions in the upper Hanse being thus divided, you may draw the streight Lines to the lower Hanse, and not divide it with the Compasses) through each of which divisions with a Rule, and Pencil, draw streight lines, then get a piece of thin Wainscot, and make it to fit between two of these Lines, allowing what thickness for Morter you intend, this will be the Sommering Mould for the Hanse; then divide the upper Scheam likewise, with the Compasses at the same distance into equal parts, and laying a Ruler on the centre I, from each Division in the Scheam GL, draw streight Lines to the lower Scheam DK, then make another Sommering Mould to fit between two of these Lines, aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting so much as you intend the thickness of your Joints of Morter to be, which if you set very close Morters, the breadth of the Line will be enough to allow; then laying the inner Edge of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:1212705000:313"/>
a Bevil streight on the line KL, bring the Tongue to touch the under side of the first Course of the Scheam, then take up the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and set that Bevil line upon the Sommering Mould of the Scheam; which Bevil line serves for each Course in the Scheam; but you must take the Bevil of each Course in the Hanse, and set them upon your Sommering Mould by themselves, and Number them with 1, 2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because each Course varies.</p>
                     <p>Thus having made your Sommering Moulds, in the next place you must make the Moulds for the length of your Stretchers, and for the breadth of the Headers and the Closiers; a piece of Wainscot seven Inches long, and three Inches and an half broad will serve for the length of the Stretchers, and the breadth of the Headers, the Closiers will be 1 Inch and ¾. broad. So the Closier will be half the breadth of the Header, and the Header half the length of the Stretcher, which will look well.</p>
                     <p>It remains now to speak something to the other part of the Arch, to wit, AD, whose Courses both in <hi>Hanse</hi> and <hi>Scheam,</hi> run alike upon the <hi>Ellipsis</hi> Lines, and seem of one big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, although perhaps there may be some small matter of difference, by reason I have not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Courses to this Figure, from a right Angle, but every Course from the Angle, which it makes with the <hi>Ellipsis,</hi> which I chose rather to do, that so the <hi>Bevil</hi> of one Course, might not seem to run more upon the <hi>Ellipsis</hi> than the <hi>Bevil</hi> of another, and the difference of the thicknesses being so inconsiderate, is not discerned.</p>

                        <pb n="277" facs="tcp:1212705000:314"/>Having described both the <hi>Ellipsis</hi> lines AD, EG, divide each of them into a like number of equal parts, always remembring to make each Division on the upper <hi>Ellipsis</hi> line, no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the thickness of the Brick will contain, when it is wrought; then through each Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in both the <hi>Ellipses</hi> draw streight lines; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing them four or five Inches above the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Ellipsis</hi> Line, and as much below the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Ellipsis</hi> Line; then having provided some thin Sheets of fine Pastboard about 20 Inches square, cutting one edge streight, take one sheet and lay the streight edge even upon the line AE, so that it may cover both the Ellipsis lines, and being cut to advantage, it may cover eight courses (or nine of the streight Lines) having laid it thus upon the figure of the Arch, stick a Pin, or two, through it, to keep it in its place; then lay a Ruler upon the Past-board true to the 7, 8, or 9th. streight Line of the Arch, according as the Past-board is in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to cover them, and take a sharp Pen-knife, laying the Ruler upon the Past-board true to the streight Line (whose ends being continued longer than the Arch is deep, as I directed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, will be seen beyond the Past-board) and cut the Past-board true to the Line, then take another sheet, and join to it, and cut it as you did the first, so continue till you have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Arch from AE, just to the line DG, sticking Pins in each Sheet to keep them in the places where you lay them: Then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe both the Ellipsis Lines upon the Past-board, from the same Centres and Radii that you described the Ellipsis's under the Past-board, and either divide the Ellipsis Lines with the Compasses on the Past-board, or else draw lines

upper Closier, and make no mistakes when you come to set them; also the middle Headers in each Course should be marked besides its own number; the thickness of the upper Header being easily discerned from the lower Header needs no marking besides its own number; the cross Joints, and likewise the under side and upper side of each Course must be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>If you will add a Keystone, and Chaptrels to the Arch, as in the <hi>Figure,</hi> let the breadth of the upper part of the Keystone be the height of the Arch, <hi>viz.</hi> 14 Inches, and Sommer, from the Centre at I, then make your Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trels the same thickness that your lower part of the Keystone is, and let the Keystone break without the Arch, so much as you project or Sale over the Jaums with the Chaptrels.</p>
                     <p>Other kind of <hi>Circular Arches,</hi> as half Rounds and Scheams, being described from one Centre, are so plain and easy, that I need say nothing concerning them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But since <hi>Streight Arches</hi> are much used, and many Workmen know not the true way of describing them, I shall write some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing briefly concerning them. <hi>Streight Arches</hi> are used generally over Windows and Doors, according to the breadth of the Piers between the Windows, so ought the Skew-back or Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering of the Arch to be; for if the Piers be of a good breadth, as three or four Bricks in length, then the <hi>Streight Arch</hi> may be described (as its vulgarly said) from the <hi>Oxi,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but part of a Word, is taken from the word <hi>Oxigonium,</hi> signifying an Equilateral Triangle,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:1212705000:317"/>
with three sharp Angles; but if the Piers are small, as sometimes they are but the length of two Bricks, and sometimes but one Brick and an half, then the breadth of the Window, or more, may be set down upon the middle Line for the Centre, which will give a less Skew-back, or Sommering, than the centre from an <hi>Oxi.</hi> I will shew how to describe them both ways, and first from the <hi>Oxi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Suppose a <hi>Streight Arch,</hi> one Brick and an half in height, to be made over a Window, 4 feet in width. [See <hi>Fig.</hi> 4.] wherein one half of the Arch is described from the <hi>Oxi,</hi> and the other half from the width of the Window, let the width of the Window be AB, taking the width between the Compasses, from A and B as two Centres, describe the two Arches, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secting each other at P, (though I speak here of Compasses, yet when you describe the Arch to its full bigness, you must use a Ruler, or a Line, scarce any Compasses being to be got large enough.) Then draw another Line above the line AB, as the line CD, being parallel to it, at such a height as you intend your Arch to be, as in this <hi>Fig.</hi> at 12 Inches; but most commonly these sort of Arches are but 11 Inches in the height, or thereabouts, which answers to four Courses of Bricks, but you may make them more or less in height accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as occasion requires; then laying a Ruler on the centre P, and on the end of the line A, draw the line AC, which is vulgarly called the <hi>Skew-back</hi> for the Arch.</p>
                     <p>The next thing to be done, is to divide those two lines AB and CD into so many Courses
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:1212705000:318"/>
as the Arch will contain; the thickness of a Brick being one of them, which some do by dividing the upper line into so many equal parts, and from those parts, and from the Centre P, draw the Sommering Lines or Courses; others divide both the upper and lower line into so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny equal parts, and make no use of a Centre, but draw the Courses by a Ruler, being laid from the Divisions on the upper line, to the Divisions on the lower line, both which ways are false and erroneous; [but this by way of caution.]</p>
                     <p>Having drawn the <hi>Skew-back</hi> AC, take be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your Compasses the thickness that a Brick will contain, which I suppose to be two Inches when it is rub'd, and setting one point of the Compasses on the line CD. So that when you turn the other Point about, it may just touch the line AC in one place, and there make a Prick in the line CD, but do not draw the Sommering lines until you have gone over half the Arch, to see how you come to the Key, or middle; and if you happen to come just to the middle line, or want an Inch of it, then you may draw the lines, but if not, then you must open, or shut the Compasses a little till you do.</p>
                     <p>Then keeping one end of the Rule close to the Centre at P. (the surest way is to strike a small Nail in the Centre P. and keep the Rule close to the Nail) lay the other end of the Rule close to the Prick that you made on the line CD, keeping the Compasses at the same width (<hi>viz.</hi> two Inches) set one point of the Compasses on the line CD, as before, so that
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:1212705000:319"/>
the other Point being turned about, may just pass by the Rule; and as it were touch it in one place; (you must remove the point of the Compasses upon the line CD, farther or near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Rule, until it just touch the Rule in one place,) and so continue with the Rule and Compasses, until you come to the middle line, and if it happen, that your last space want an Inch of the middle, then the middle of the Key-course will be the middle of the Arch, and the number of the Courses in the whole Arch will be odd, but if the last space happen to fall just upon the middle line EF, as it doth in the <hi>Fig.</hi> then the Joint is the middle of the Arch, (but if it should happen neither to come even to the line, nor want an Inch of it, then you must open or shut the Compasses a small matter, and begin again till it doth come right) and the number of the Courses in the whole Arch, is an even Number.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> When the number of all the Courses in the Arch, is an even Number, then you must begin the two sides contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> A Header to be the lower Brick of the first Course on one side (or half) of the Arch, and a Stretcher the lower Brick of the first Course on the other side (or half) of the Arch: And contrariwise, if it happen that the Number of the Courses be an odd Number, as 25 or 27, or such like, then the first Courses of each half of the Arch, must be alike, that is, either both Headers, or both Stretchers, at the bottom.</p>
                     <p>Thus having described the Arch, the next thing to be done, is to make the Sommering Mould, which to do, get a piece of thin Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scot
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:1212705000:320"/>
(being streight on one edge, and having one side plained smooth, to set the Bevil strokes upon) about 14 Inches long, and any breadth above two Inches, then laying your Ruler, one end at the Centre P, and the other end even in the Skew-back line, clap the streight edge of the Wainscot close to the Rule, so that the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er end of the Wainscot may lye a little below the line AB, then take away the Centre Rule, but stir not the Wainscot; and laying a Ruler upon the Wainscot just over the line CD, strike a line upon the Wainscot, then set one Point of the Compasses being at the width of a Course (<hi>viz.</hi> two Inches) upon that line, so that the other Point being turned about, may just touch the streight edge of the Wainscot; (as you did before in dividing the Courses) then make a Prick on the line on the Wainscot, and laying your Centre Rule upon it, and on the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre P, draw a line upon the Wainscot by the Ruler, with a Pencil, or the Point of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, and cut the Wainscot to that line, and make it streight by shooting it with a Plain, then your Wainscot will fit exactly between any two lines of the Arch; you may let it want the thickness of one of the lines, or some small matter more, which is enough for the thickness of a Mortar; the length of your Stretcher in this Arch, may be 8 Inches and ¼, and the Header 3 Inches and ¾, but if your Arch be but 11 Inches in height, then make your Stretcher 7 Inches and ½ long, and the Header 3 Inches ½; one piece of Wainscot will serve both for the length of the Stretcher, and the length of the Header, making it like a long square or Oblong, whose sides are 8 Inches ¼, and 3 Inches and ¾. Then take a Bevil, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:1212705000:321"/>
the inner edge of it streight with the line AB, and the Angle of the Bevil just over the Angle at A, take off the Angle that the Skew-back line AC makes with the line AB, and set it upon the smoothed side of your Sommering Mould, for the Bevil stroke of your first Course; then drawing your Bevil towards E, streight in the line, until the Angle of the Bevil be just over the Angle, that the second Sommering line makes with the line AB; when it is so, draw the Tongue of the Bevil to lye even upon the second Sommering line; (in brief, cause the Bevil to lye exactly on the line AB, and on the second Sommering line) then take up your Bevil and lay it on the Mould; and strike that Bevil line on the Mould, with the Point of the Compasses, about half a quarter of an Inch distant from the first, and that is the Bevil of the underside of the second Course; proceed thus until you come to the middle line EF, but after you have set three Bevil lines upon your Sommering Mould, leave about ¼ of an Inch between the third and the fourth, and so likewise between the 6th and 7th, and the 9th, and 10th, which will be a great help to you, in knowing the Number of each line on the Mould.</p>
                     <p>The Moulds for the other half of the Arch, namely EB, are made after the same manner, but but the Arch is described from a Centre beneath P, as Q which causeth a less Skew-back (<hi>viz.</hi> B. D.)</p>
                     <p>The diminishing of the Sommering Mould to any Skew-back may be found by the Rule of Three, by dividing a foot into 10 equal parts,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1212705000:322"/>
and each of these into 10 parts, so that the whole foot may contain 100 parts, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thus. The upper line CF, will be 309, that is three Feet and almost one Inch, and the lower line AE will be 252, that is two Feet and an half an 2/100, and the upper part of the Sommering Mould will be 17 almost, that is, two Inches of such whereof there are 12 in a foot line measure; having these three Numbers (viz. 309, 252, 17.) work according to the Rule of Three, and you will find 13 and 6/1 of 100 parts, that is almost 14 (such parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are 100 in a Foot line measure) for the breadth of the lower part of the Mould.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE Clinatory is made of a square Board, ABCD, of a good thickness, and the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the better; between two of the sides is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed on the Center A, a <hi>Quadrant</hi> as EF divided into 90 equal parts or degrees, which are figured with 10, 20, 30 to 90; and then back again with the Complements of the same Numbers to 90: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Limb and the two Semi-diameters is made a round Box, into which a Magnetical Needle is fitted; and a Card of the Nautical Compass, divided into four nineties, beginning their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers at the <hi>East West North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> points of the Compass, from which points the opposite sides of the Clinatory receives their Names of <hi>East, West, North</hi> and <hi>South.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But <hi>Note,</hi> That the North point of the Card must be placed so many degrees towards the <hi>East</hi> or <hi>West</hi> sides of the Clinatory, as the Needle varies from the true <hi>North</hi> point of the World, in the place where you make your Dyal; which your Workman that makes your Clinatory will know how to sit.</p>
                        <p>Upon the Center A, whereon the Quadrant was described, is fastned a Plumb-line, having a Plummet of Lead or Brass fastned to the end of it, which Plumb-line is of such length that the Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met may fall just into the Groove GH, below the Quadrant, which is for that purpose made of such a depth, that the Plummet may ride freely within it, without stopping at the sides of it, <hi>See the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure annexed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>With this Clinatory you may examine the sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of Planes. As if your Plane be Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, it is direct: and then for the true scituating your Dyal, you have only the true North and South Line to find: which is done only by setting the Clinatory flat down upon the Plane, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it towards the right or left hand, till you can bring the North point of the Needle to hang just over the Flower-de-luce; for then if you draw a Line by either of the sides parallel to the Needle, that Line shall be a North and South Line.</p>
                        <p>If your Plane either Recline or Incline, apply one of the sides of your Clinatory parallel to one
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:1212705000:333"/>
of the Semi-diameters of the Quadrant to the Plane, in such sort that the Plumb-line hanging at liberty, may fall upon the Circumference of the Quadrant, for then the number of degrees of the Quadrant comprehended between the side of the Quadrant parallel to the Plane, and the Plumb-line shall be the number of degrees for Reclination, if the Center of the Quadrant points upwards; or Inclination, if the Center points downwards.</p>
                        <p>If your Reclining or Inclining Plane decline, draw upon it a Line parallel to the Horizon, which you may do by applying the Back-side of the Clinatory, and raising or depressing the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Quadrant, till the Plumb-line hang just upon one of the Semi-diameters, for then you may by the upper-side of the Clinatory draw an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal Line if the Plane Incline, or by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-side, if it Recline. If it neither Incline or Recline, you may draw a Horizontal Line both by the upper and under sides of the Clinatory. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving drawn the Horizontal Line, apply the North side of the Clinatory to it, and if the North end of the Needle points directly towards the Plane, it is then a South Plane. If the North point of the Needle points directly from the Plane, it is a <hi>North</hi> Plane: But if it points towards the <hi>East,</hi> it is an <hi>East</hi> Plane: If towards the <hi>West,</hi> a <hi>West</hi> Plane. If it do not point directly either East, West, North, or South, then so many degrees as the Needle declines from any of these four points to any of the other of these four points, so many degrees is the Declination of the Plane.</p>
                        <p>You may find a Meridian Line another way; thus, If the Sun shine just at Noon, hold up a Plumb-line so as the shadow of it may fall upon your Plane, and that shadow shall be a <hi>Meridian Line.</hi>
