            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Sir, be pleaſed to read the Title-Page. I began this Collection chiefly upon what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s, and beſides finding moſt of my Cuſtomers eager to ſee the Minds of Men, eſpecially in the Caſe of <hi>Epiſtolary Writing;</hi> and having conſiderable Supplies of the Kind, I publiſhed a <hi>Second Volume,</hi> as you ſee; and have Materials of equal Value, and ſufficient in Quantity, to make a <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Fourth.</hi>

What a Pox, do you think Gentlemen muſt be at the Slavery, like School-boys, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruing it to them in <hi>Engliſh?</hi> It would be well for you if you could pacify Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> perhaps if he and you were Friends, he might be prevailed on to take a hundred Guineas to do it for you.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Dryden</hi> was a tolerable Poet in his Time, but nothing in Compariſon to <hi>Pope.</hi> There's <hi>Le Neve</hi>'s <hi>Will and Creed,</hi> I like well enough, becauſe they contain partly my own Religion: But there's his Epitaph in <hi>Latin,</hi> why is not that tranſlated?</p>

                     <p>I grant it, Sir, becauſe the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of them did not intend it: But I am told there is much <hi>Good Senſe</hi> in them; that they open the Scene of the famous <hi>Partition Treaty,</hi> and the Deſigns of <hi>France</hi> upon the Death of King CHARLES II. of <hi>Spain;</hi> that they diſcover the Importance of a Man who is truſted with Affairs, and how mere <hi>un homme ſans conſequence</hi> a Man may be, with a great Employment, if the Conduct of the ſecret Springs of Action is placed in other Hands: With many other uſeful Leſſons.</p>

But, I preſume, had it been ſo, a <hi>Jacobite</hi> might poſſibly be a Man of Wit; for Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> is allowed to be ſo, tho' he owns himſelf a Papiſt. But here are Letters of my Lord's, that ſhew other Sort of Sentiments at a riper Age, with Regard to the Revolution Settlement.</p>

            <head>To Mr. CURLL.</head>
            <p>I Have read the Three Volumes of your <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary Correſpondence</hi> with Satisfaction. A Collection of good Letters is much wanted in our Language. The <hi>French</hi> have ſeveral; and I think they outdo us in no other Article of polite Literature. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Letters, written on Purpoſe to be publiſhed, are apt to fall ſhort of the vivid Force and Openneſs found in the unboſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Friend to Friend; therefore it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly difficult to imitate well, as it alſo is to obtain the Papers of a valuable real Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence.</p>
            <p>If Gentlemen could be ſatisfied, there would be no Endeavours to know how Letters came to the Preſs, I am perſuaded, our free, learned, polite Age and Country, might eaſily find you a genuine Collection in the beſt Taſte.</p>
            <p>For my own Part I will not have any Doubt of your Conduct in this Reſpect; therefore you now receive incloſed the very Mind of a Man of Senſe and Rank in his Country, upon public Affairs, from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution to the Year 1730. Moſt of them were Letters to the late Biſhop <hi>Atterbury,</hi>
               <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0104100603:11"/>
and the reſt, to an intimate Friend of his, who died before him.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop, a few Months before his Death, lent them to a Nobleman in <hi>France</hi> (from whom I had them) and at the ſame Time he told him, <hi>they were written by the honeſteſt Whig of his Acquaintance;</hi> that he differ'd from the Writer upon ſeveral Points, but look'd upon him to be a good <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in the main; that he (the Biſhop) had been cenſur'd by his Enemies as a hot Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-man, but that he could always reliſh the Correſpondence of a Perſon of Sincerity and Honour, though of different Sentiments in Politics or Religion; and that if he did not live to aſk for theſe Letters again (as he found himſelf in a declining Condition) he deſired they might not be loſt, becauſe there was <hi>much Truth and good Senſe in them;</hi> but inſiſted, <hi>that if they went abroad, it would be in ſuch a Manner as not to prejudice the Writer of them in any Branch of his Family, which might have Occaſion for the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Men in Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you think it agreeable to your Scheme, you may publiſh them; if not, I wiſh you Supplies more to your Purpoſe, and am,</p>

               <p>I Here ſend you the Elegy<note n="*" place="bottom">This, with ſome other Poetical Pieces, will be found in our FOURTH Volume.</note>, which you have but too often demanded of me, and which heretofore hath indeed been heard by others, but, till now, hath not been read by any.</p>
               <p>It is my Wiſh, that the ſame Fortune may in this happen to me as hath befallen you; who, after you have for ſo long time concealed the nobleſt things in the World, have in the Diſcovery of it, dazled all thoſe that have ſeen it. But it is an over-great Fondneſs for my own Verſes, to wiſh them that Advantage, nor indeed ſhould I wiſh them better, ſince they were not made for you: If you think them very ill, you are ſo much the more obliged to me for them, in that knowing it as well as you, yet I have not forborn ſending them to you. And, to deal freely with you, a leſs Power than what you have within theſe few Days gained upon me, would not have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:0104100603:21"/>
to have prevailed with me to do it: And, without your Command, Madam, they had never known any other Place than that of my own Memory. But it is high time it were delivered of them, to make room for ſomething more delightful; I mean that which Mrs. **** had the Grace to acquaint me with the other Day, and which fills it ſo much at preſent, that I doubt whether there be Place for any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>I perceive, Madam, that where it was my Deſign to ſend you a Letter of Excuſe and Compliment, I am fallen into one of Love; but I wiſh all the other Defects you ſhall find in it, were as pardonable as that. In the mean time let me aſſure you, that I have not of a long time been ſo engaged, and that there are many in the World to whom I would not ſay ſo much, even tho' they held a Dagger at my Throat.</p>
               <p>But, ſince there is no fear of any Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, you are obliged, Madam, at leaſt in my Opinion, to look favourably on thoſe Elements of Affection, were it but to ſee, how I ſhould behave myſelf, if I ſhould fall in Love; and, if I were permitted, what might be the Conſequence of it.</p>

               <p>THO' my Liberty were, as you ſay, greater than <hi>Alexander</hi>'s, it were more than recompenced by the Thanks you have been pleaſed to return it. Even his Ambition, as inſatiable as it was, would, by ſo extraordinary a Favour, have been li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited. He would have valued this Honour more highly than the <hi>Perſian</hi> Diadem, and he would not have envied <hi>Achilles</hi> the Praiſes of <hi>Homer,</hi> might he have Yours. In like manner, Madam, conſidering the Reputation you do me, if I envy his, it is not ſo much that which he hath acquired, as what you have beſtowed on him, and he hath received no Honours which I do not look upon below my own, unleſs it be that you do him, when you call him your Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant. Neither his own Vanity nor his Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers have ever advanced any thing ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to him, and the Quality of the Son of <hi>Jupiter Ammon</hi> was not ſo glorious as that. But, if nothing can cure me of
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:0104100603:23"/>
the Jealouſy I have of it, yet, Madam, knowing you as I do, I am confident, if you do him that Favour, it is not ſo much becauſe he is the greateſt of Mankind, as becauſe it is Two Thouſand Years ſince he was.</p>
               <p>However it be, we may ſee, in this, the Greatneſs of his Fortune, which not able to forſake him ſo many Years after his Death, adds to his Conqueſts a Perſon which cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates them more than the Wife and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Darius,</hi> and hath re-infuſed into him a Soul greater than that of the World he hath ſubdued.</p>

               <p>I Could never believe it poſſible that the Receipt of a Letter from you ſhould add to my Affliction, or that you could have poſſibly ſent me ſuch bad News, as that you could not comfort me at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>I thought my Unhappineſs at ſuch a Point as could not admit of any Addition, and that ſince you were able ſomething to ſtrengthen my Patience to endure the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of your Mother and You, there could not be any Misfortune which You could not have encouraged me to ſuffer. But give me leave to tell you, that I have found the contrary in the Affliction I have for the Death of Mrs. <hi>A****,</hi> which hath been heavy enough to cruſh me, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not much to ſpend the Remainder of my Patience.</p>
               <p>

You may eaſily judge, Madam, what an exceſſive Grief it muſt needs be to me to have loſt a Friend ſo good, ſo ſprightly and ſo accompliſhed as ſhe, and one that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always given me ſo many Expreſſions of her Affection, would needs do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing when ſhe had not many Hours to continue here. But tho' I reflected not on my own Concernments, yet could I not but infinitely regret a Perſon by whom you were infinitely beloved; and who, among many particular Endowments, had that of knowing you as much as may be, and eſteeming you above all things. Yet I muſt confeſs, if this Diſturbance can admit of any Remiſſion, it is to reflect on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy ſhe expreſſed, and the Fortitude wherewith ſhe hath ſuffered a Thing whereof the Name would make her trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at any time.</p>
               <p>I am extremely comforted to underſtand, that at her Death, ſhe had thoſe Qualities which only ſhe wanted in her Life, and that ſhe ſo opportunely found Courage and Reſolution. When I conſider it ſeriouſly, it is ſomewhat againſt my Conſcience to bemoan her, and methinks it ſpeaks an over-intereſted Affection, to be ſad becauſe ſhe hath left us to better her Condition, and is gone into the other World, (<hi>from</hi>

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">HAMLET.</note>) to find that Quiet ſhe could never meet with in this.</p>
               <p>I very heartily entertain the Exhortations you give me thereupon, which is, often to con over a Leſſon ſo profitable and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and to prepare myſelf for the like one Day; I know how to make my Advantage of your Remonſtrance. The Miſeries we have run thro' all this while is no ſmall Preparation for it: There's no better Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to inſtruct a Man how to die well, than not to take much Pleaſure in living.</p>
               <p>But if it be not impoſſible for the Hopes that Fortune propoſes to prove effectual; if after ſo many Years, we may preſume to expect ſome few fair Days, be pleaſed to give me leave, Madam, to entertain Thoughts more diverting than thoſe of Death; and if it be likely that we are ſhortly to ſee one another, let me not fall out with my Life.</p>
               <p>Where you ſay, <hi>You think me deſtined to great Things,</hi> you give ſo great Security of my Life, and ſo happy a Preſage of the Adventures that ſhall happen to me, that I ſhall not be ſorry for its Continuance yet

a while. For my part, if Deſtiny doth promiſe me any thing that is good, I aſſure you I will do my utmoſt to get it. I will contribute all I can thereto, that <hi>your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies may be fulfilled.</hi> In the mean time, I beſeech you to be confident, that of all the Favours I can beg of Fortune, what I moſt paſſionately deſire is, that ſhe would do for you what ſhe ought, and for myſelf, only afford me the Means to acquaint you with the Paſſion which obliges me to be ſo much,</p>

               <p>THeſe Memoirs go no farther than the Parliament's reſolving to treat no more with the King. My Lord <hi>Holles</hi> was of the Presbyterian Party, zealous at firſt, to take Arms againſt the King, but would not have carried it ſo far as the Independents did; he writes very virulently againſt them, gives Inſtances of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s and <hi>Haſlerig</hi>'s Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, as may be ſeen in the annexed Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;<note n="*" place="bottom">Alluding to the Table in the Manuſcript.</note> mentions Lord <hi>Savile</hi> as an Impoſtor, who accuſed himſelf and others.</p>

This Book is an Apology for the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Presbyterians, and a Satire againſt the Army and Independents, but wrote in ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and declaiming a Stile, that it does not pleaſe me; it treats only of public Facts known to every body, and tells none of thoſe ſecret Intrigues, Schemes, Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are what is moſt valuable in theſe ſort of Books.</p>

               </p>
               <p>By a Letter from <hi>King</hi>'s-College, <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> I am informed, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> was bred at <hi>Eton,</hi> in quality of an Oppidane; where he was very remarkable, even while a Boy, for a good Taſte of the Claſſics, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He was admitted a Fellow-Commoner of <hi>King</hi>'s-College, <hi>July</hi> 8, 1693, where, under the Tuition of Dr. <hi>Hare,</hi> he was ſoon perceived to grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable in the rougheſt Tracts of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, particularly the <hi>Ars Cogitandi:</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0104100603:54"/>
He was almoſt a ſingular Example a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe of his Station. <hi>Rarus ferme communis ſenſus in illa fortuna,</hi> ſays <hi>Horace,</hi> is as applicable to a Man of flouriſhing Circumſtances, as to the Patriot; and tho' it has been much controverted what was the Poet's View, yet in both Lights Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> has been thought to be an Exception."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Since Mr. LOCKE hath declared, that he <hi>conſidered Mr.</hi> COLLINS <hi>as a Philoſopher, and a Chriſtian,</hi> all the ſneering and lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Sarcaſms of <hi>Eccleſiaſtics</hi> ought to be held in the utmoſt Contempt.

               <p>That Part of <hi>Biography,</hi> Sir, which records Men famous in the Republic of Letters, is generally acceptable to the Learned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it attempteth to gratify a Curioſity, which prevaileth much, and is nouriſhed among them; whereby they are prompted to ſearch for, and enquire after the minuteſt Circumſtances, which relate to ſuch Authors, who are no otherwiſe known to them, than by the Works they have left behind them.</p>

'Tis well, as you obſerve, that they agree as ill with one another, as they do with common Senſe. For when by the Influence of ſome prevailing Head, they all lean one Way; Truth is ſure to be borne down, and there is nothing ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as to make any Enquiry after her; and to own her, for her own ſake, is the moſt unpardonable Crime.—'Tis no ſmall Advantage to me to have found ſuch a Friend, at the laſt Scene of my Life; when I am good for nothing, and am grown ſo uſeleſs, that I cannot but be ſure, that in every good Office you do me, you can propoſe to your ſelf no other Advantage, but the Pleaſure of doing it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter of 19. <hi>March</hi> 1704.</note>—Give me leave to deſire you, to beſtow ſome of your ſpare Hours on the <hi>Epiſtles to the Corinthians,</hi>

               <head>A LETTER To Mr. P***</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>EJOICE with me, my Friend, there is Probability of mine Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, this is the Reign of Expectancy. Never, if not now, ſhall I become conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Places of National and mighty Truſt, are given to thoſe the World will truſt no longer. Emulous of the <hi>Roman</hi> Simplicity, our Nobility, like ſo many CINCINNA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUS's, ſeem to be taken from the Plough; our Clergy, repreſenting the Mechanic Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory Founders of Chriſtianity, are Men of mean Deſcent, and altogether as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for their Ignorance. But as the uninterrupted Succeſſion of their Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is moſt undeniable, the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire theſe with thoſe. <hi>Saul</hi> from a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0104100603:61"/>
of his Father's ASSES, became a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Father to the People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and left his former Care. <hi>Caeſar</hi> too was called to be a King, but he retained his ASSES; ſome he made Judges, ſome Biſhops, and ſome Ambaſſadors, which occaſioned the Scoffers to ſay, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> only wore the <hi>Lion</hi>'s Skin. What led me, I believe, to this Subject, was the hearing of Papers now crying about the Streets, intitled, <hi>The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Aſſes;</hi> which naturally brought to my Remembrance, many Folks and Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, both at Home and Abroad. We have a Poet Laureat here, Thanks to my Lord Chamberlain, now grown old, who is twice a-Year brought forth to be kicked at by his Brethren.</p>

Nothing ſeems to me more unjuſt, than the Contempt which is offered to this noble ANIMAL by the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, who miſtake his ſolemn Majeſty for Dullneſs. Should this Epiſtle ever appear in Public, as I hope it never will, I am ſenſible it would be thought an inſinuating

Artifice of mine, to get a Place at Court, or recommend myſelf to Somebody in Power; whereas, I have no ſuch Intention, I aſſure you, but ſhall diſintereſtedly, and without Flattery, as far as I am able, take away part of the Burden from the Back of this generous Beaſt: For, What is heavier than an ill Name? in doing which, I have only imitated the renowned <hi>Osborn's</hi> and <hi>Walſingham's</hi> of theſe our Times, whoſe Labours I muſt acknowledge to be as far ſuperior to mine, as they are more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult: But to proceed; ASSES formerly were not contemptible, their Names were not made a Reproach; they ſometimes were cloathed in Furs like our Aldermen, and ſometimes in Scarlet, and Cloath of Gold, and King's and Princes uſed to ride upon them. <hi>Midas,</hi> a <hi>Phrygian</hi> Monarch, had himſelf the Ears of an Ass, which was in thoſe Days, held an uncommon Thing. Kings will not, out of brotherly Affection, deſpiſe them, moreover this ſtately Beaſt is not to be prevailed upon by Blows; the venerable Diſpenſers of our Laws are not endowed with more Gravity; all the Holy-gifted ones, ſhould reſpect him as an Elder, and one of themſelves; for he once ſpoke by the ſame Divine Power, they would be thought to ſpeak by: Beſides, he has that in him, which is well Worthy of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0104100603:63"/>
their Imitation, I mean his <hi>Patience.</hi> Both Sacred and Profane Hiſtory have emble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized Strength and Heroiſm by the Ass, than which, nothing can be more natural, noble, beautiful, or juſt. <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he bleſſes his Sons, ſays, Iſſachar <hi>is a ſtrong</hi> Ass, <hi>crouching down between two Burdens.</hi> And <hi>Homer,</hi> in the Eleventh Book of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> compares <hi>Ajax,</hi> making a noble Retreat, to one of theſe <hi>Animals</hi> forcing his Way into a Field of Corn, there ſatisfying his Hunger, and then retiring with a tardy ſullen Intrepidity, Maugre the Oppoſition of a Troop of Boys,

Had I nothing elſe to offer in their Behalf, the above-mentioned Inſtances are ſufficient to abate all Ridicule, and draw Reſpect from the viperous Tongue of Calumny itſelf.</p>
               <p>But farther, the moſt eminent Poets, Orators, Hiſtorians and Naturaliſts, have not thought it beneath them to treat of the Ass, either in Metaphor, Simile, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription Narrative. <hi>Pliny Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Cap.</hi> 37. gives large Account of him, deſcribes his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Paſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſhews us what Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we are to form of the pricking-up, and what from the limber and half-erected Poſition of his Ears. <hi>Virgil</hi> mentions him but ſparingly. <hi>Horace</hi> more frequent, the

Scarce do I know whether the Ass is more indebted to the Poet for this excellent Deſcription of him, or the Poet to the Ass, for thoſe Qualifications of his, which were the Occaſion of it: But certain I am, that every Language is enriched with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny terſe Sayings, Proverbs and Sentences, drawn from the known Qualities of this Quadrupede, <hi>fait en dos d'Aſne,</hi> ſignifies any Thing done with Cunning. <hi>Aſinus Antro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> is a Lob-Cock. <hi>Aſinus ad Lyram,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> in the Greek, are Proverbs which ſeem to reflect upon the Ass for his Unskilfulneſs in Muſic; whereas the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is manifeſt, for this Animal pays an extraordinary Attention to every ſort of Wind-Muſic, as may be eaſily diſcover'd by the pricking-up of his Ears, his ſimpering Geſture, his frolic Spurning of the Heels, attended by the Clangor of his own Pipe, with a ſeeming Deſire to bear a Part. It is moſt unqueſtionable, that he has the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of all other Beaſts, the Sounds he utters being more articulate: And many learned Critics agree, that no living Pipe ſo nearly reſembles the Hautboy, Bagpipe, or that more admired new-invented Water-Muſic, the French-Horn; the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers upon which Inſtruments, if he does

                  <hi>Oenus</hi> reſembles thoſe helliſh Miniſters, who thro' their evil Counſels make Ropes to bind the People in Slavery.

               <p>I Am got ſafe to <hi>Hartley-Row,</hi> and in a little better Humour than when I wrote my laſt. Our Landlord is a perfect Beau, and moſt exquiſitely performs the Honours of his Houſe. I am in pain for his Aſſidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: I cannot fetch a Step, no not to the Window, from the Table, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he is Squiring me; and ſo dreſſed, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, that nothing but ſerving a looſe Apprenticeſhip, could have ſet him up a Maſter in the Trade of Foppery. He was a <hi>Goldſmith</hi>'s 'Prentice, where he ſtudied more his Pleaſures, than Profit. This Houſe fell to him, and he wiſely reſolved to keep it himſelf, with the Help of his Siſter, who is a neat, houſewifely, obliging ſort of Woman. I ſuppoſe it is, by much, the beſt Entertainment this Road affords. They have a tolerable Cook; and I was glad to find ſomething I could eat at Three o'Clock, for we came in here at Two, and I can give you a little better Account of my Fellow-Travellers. The <hi>Sir,</hi> I ſpoke
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0104100603:78"/>
of, is a Baronet's Son, as he has carefully given me to underſtand: I take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he <hi>likes</hi> me, and would have me do the <hi>ſame</hi> by him. As he came in, he put off his Travelling Suit, for a Coat and Veſt, deſigned to dazzle the Curate and all his Congregation. The Way I took to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his Foppery, was, not to ſpeak a Word of the Change; which made him extream uneaſy: At length, cut of all Patience, he deſired my Opinion, if his Taylor had uſed him well? What the Brocade was worth a Yard? How many Ounces of Silver-Fringe? And recommended to my Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity the exquiſite Workmanſhip of the Loops; and then gave me the Sum Total of his Coſt. I anſwered him, That Finery was loſt upon me; I neither was, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be a Judge. He pertly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, He perceived by my Sullenneſs, that I had a great deal of Wit; tho' I underſtood he had but little by his Remark. Well, all this did not do: He would fain have had me enquired into his Family, Intrigues, and Fortune; which when he perceived I had no Curioſity for, 'Faith Madam, <hi>(ſays he)</hi> I beg your Ladyſhip's Opinion, if I am not the moſt unfortunate Man breathing: I'll tell you a very mortifying Adventure. Nay, you muſt hear me. I vow, this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency does not look natural to you;

your Eyes promiſe us much more Fire. <hi>I'll ſhut 'em, thought I, for ever, rather than ſuch a Fop ſhall find any thing to like them for.</hi> What! no Anſwer, Madam, <hi>(ſays he)</hi> I perceive your Attention by your Silence. 'Gad, I love a Perſon of your Breeding, that know themſelves better than to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt a good Story. Perhaps Madam is not well with her Journey, <hi>anſwered Mrs.</hi> May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oreſs <hi>of</hi> Totneſs. Alas! I wonder Riding in the Coach ſhould not have got you a better Stomach. Poor Gentlewoman, ſhe has ſcarce eat any thing.

               <p>It happened at <hi>Oxford</hi> three Months ago (where I often came, my Father's Eſtate being not far diſtant) I ſaw a Lady, and fell in Love with her; ay Gad, Madam, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in Love with her. She was a Perſon genteely bred, and had ſeen the <hi>Beau-Monde,</hi> made the <hi>Tour</hi> of all the Places of Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſhined in the Drawing-Room, languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Boxes, adorned the Park; in a Word, was all a Man of my Circumſtances
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0104100603:80"/>
could deſire in one he was reſolved to make an Oblation of his Heart to. But as her Honour was my Care, and not marrying my Deſign, I ſearched for a dexterous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to viſit, and be happy. I took Mr. <hi>Slye</hi> with me, a Gentleman of the Town, who had a Wife: To give you the Character of my Friend, He was naturally amorous, had a handſome Perſon, and Strains of natural Wit beyond whatever I ſaw in the moſt Acquired; and your Ladyſhip muſt allow me to be a Judge of Wit, by ſo dexterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finding out yours, maugre your Silence. I bowed for this extraordinary Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and thought I could not more agreeably return it, than by continuing my Silence; and as the Poet has it, <hi>left him to his dear Miſtake.</hi> Mr. <hi>Slye,</hi> continued he, was to propoſe a Marriage between me and my Lady <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> to the old People her Relations, whom ſhe was juſt come to live with: But as ſoon as he ſaw her, if I was her Firſt <hi>Oxford</hi> Victim, he was certainly the Second; and, as I found, preſently took with her. She had a very fine Hand, which Mr. <hi>Slye,</hi> according to the Country Liberty, kiſſed; and then, with <hi>Cleveland,</hi> ſaid,
<q>
                     <l>So ſoft, 'tis Air but once remov'd;</l>
                     <l>Tender, as 'twere a Jelly Glov'd.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0104100603:81"/>
She gave him a Look, which ſeemed to ſay, ſhe wondered in that Place at ſuch a Piece of Gallantry; and then purſuing with her Wit the Victory of her Eyes, charm'd my Friend to that Degree, that he told me, he muſt enjoy her, or die. <hi>'Gad, Madam, was not this a very odd Turn? I carried him to ſpeak for me; and he comes to make me the Confidant of his Deſigns?</hi> We agreed tho', as Friends ſhould, to keep our mutual Confidence ſecret from her, and to endeavour each of us to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf happy, and faithfully to relate the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of our Amours. But becauſe the Country is much given to Tatling, the Pretenſions of Marriage went on. Lady <hi>Conqueſt</hi> was Airy and Coquet; loved Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Gallantry, if they could be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with Safety: But ſhe knew ſo well how to manage every body, that none durſt ſpeak to her, more than ſhe had a mind to hear. I was one of the awed Fools. <hi>'Gad! would you believe, Madam, that Love could make ſo great an Aſs of a Man of my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding?</hi> And yet it was not altogether that neither, my Pride was concerned; I was reſolv'd not to ſerve for her Diverſion, till I was ſure ſhe was conſenting to be mine; but could no more keep out of her Company, than I could hang myſelf. I deſired her to walk: She conſented, with a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0104100603:82"/>
Crony ſhe picked up, upon Condition I would engage Mr. <hi>Slye</hi> of the Party. I was jealous, but to no Purpoſe; either my Rival's Company, or not my Miſtreſs's. <hi>Slye</hi> pretended Fear of his Wife, that he durſt not appear in public with any other Woman; for ſhe already began to have Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of my Lady <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> whoſe Way of Living was remote to thoſe of Country-Gentlewomens; and therefore he was reſolved to think no more of her; tho' infinitely pleaſing to him; for his Fortune depended, in a great meaſure, upon his Wife's Mother. I came back with this doleful News to Lady <hi>Conqueſt. Go tell him,</hi> anſwered ſhe, <hi>he who has pretended to love me, ſhould fear nothing more than not being beloved; and that I command him to meet us at the appointed Place.</hi> I ran, like a Fool, to do her Meſſage, which I believed Raillery, becauſe ſhe ought to have been more cautious of a married Man's Love, if ſerious. <hi>Slye</hi> wanted but Intreaty: He conſented, and we met, but not to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; tho' the Expence was mine, he had the Profit: She was not eaſy unleſs he ſat nigh her; ſhe talked to him, ſtared at him, did every thing to ſhew ſhe was pleaſed; whilſt I, by a Notion of Pride, would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend nothing, for fear I ſhould not have all: <hi>For 'Gad, Madam, I do not love being baulked thus.</hi> Several Times we met, but all
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0104100603:83"/>
as little to the Purpoſe. Undoubtedly, ſhe ſaw I loved her, but would not ſee, becauſe I was of Uſe in her Affair with <hi>Slye.</hi> The whole Town talked of our approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wedding, and I began to be Fool enough to reſolve on it, thro' <hi>Slye</hi>'s Perſuaſion, who continually extolled her Honour and Virtue, and tickled my Pride with the News of her Love; but that ſhe wanted a Declaration from me, before I could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Confeſſion from her. I told him, I would think on it; and ſo we parted. That Night (as Chance would have it) I paſſed along by the Houſe where ſhe lived, and I found the Gate open: I know not what Devil of Curioſity carried me in; and when in, to go to her Chamber: I did both unſeen, and concealed myſelf behind the Bed, which I ſaw ſitted for Night. I reſolved to wait till ſhe ſhould be in Bed, and then to take Advantage of her Woman's Abſence, (who lay in the Anti-Chamber) and there to declare my Love, and offer her Marriage. Long I had not waited, <hi>(tho' 'Gad, Madam, I was very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, and thought every Minute Seven)</hi> when the charming Fair came from her Dreſſing-Room, with nothing on but her Night-Gown and Slippers, which were ſoon thrown off, and the Goddeſs appeared more beauteous than the naked Queen of Love. The happy Bed ſoon received her;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0104100603:84"/>
and ſhe cryed, <hi>Haſte, and bring my Lover to me.</hi> At theſe Words her Woman went into the Anti-Chamber, and returned ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with <hi>Slye;</hi> who flew to her Arms, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, kiſſed, and died there.—<hi>Imagine my Surprize!</hi> 'Twas ſo great I could not in a long time ſhew myſelf to interrupt 'em: At length, ſeeing him undreſs for Bed, 'Gad, Madam, my Patience was quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; <hi>Traytor,</hi> ſays I, ſhewing myſelf, <hi>Is it thus thou preſerveſt thy feigned Duty to thy Wife?</hi> I laid my Hand upon my Sword, and he did the like on his; and we had certainly drawn, had not the Amorous Fair thrown herſelf out of Bed between us, and conjured us on her Knees to make no Noiſe, elſe ſhe was loſt for ever. I raiſed her naked Beauties, and carried them whence they came, but complained at my hard Fortune, which had made me the Inſtrument of my own Ruin. She ſaw I was extreamly touched at it, and after her Shame and Surprize was a little over, <hi>You have no Reaſon, Sir,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>to complain of me: I could have no Engagements with a Man who never pretended to love me. Tho' you have given me the Glory of refuſing you as a Huſband (in the Eyes of the Town) it could not but nettle me, to know there was nothing ſerious on your Side, but done like a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to ſecure my Reputation amongſt ill-bred</hi>

                  <hi>Fools, who know not the Charms of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and will not permit it (without Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) to thoſe that do. But 'Gad, Madam,</hi> (anſwered I) <hi>your Ladyſhip is not ſo dull, but to know I loved you: All my Aſſiduities, Uneaſineſs, Sighs, and Ogleings, muſt have informed you. Our Sex dares hardly believe yours</hi> (ſhe replied) <hi>when you take Pains to ſpeak: And ſure it were an unpardonable Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to draw ſuch Conſequences without it. Theſe Circumſtances you pretend, I have found common to all Gentlemen: Therefore muſt I conclude the whole World is in Love with me; and deny myſelf thoſe who tell me they are my Servants, for the vain Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that another is ſilently ſo? 'Gad, Madam,</hi> (anſwered I) <hi>I cannot poſſibly forgive the Preference of a dull, ſilly, ſober, married Man, to an airy, well-dreſſed, young, amorous One. I will be gone to</hi> London <hi>by Break of Day, for fear I ſhould not conceal my Reſentments, and ſo injure your Ladyſhip irreparably: For 'Gad, Madam, I muſt repeat again, you were to blame to ſlight all the Pains I took to breed you for nobler Game.</hi> This laſt, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, broke my ſplenetic Silence, and I could not hold laughing heartily; which amply paid my Squire for the Pains he had taken in his Relation. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it with telling me his Journey to <hi>London,</hi> and ſhort Stay there, only to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couter;

his Deſign of viſiting a Lady-Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, married into <hi>Devonſhire:</hi> And cloſed with Lauds to his good Fortune, that had thrown him into a Coach with a Lady of my Charms and Senſe, to whom he had ſacrificed the Relicks of Lady <hi>Conqueſt</hi> the firſt Minute that he ſaw me. I anſwered him, That I found Experience had made him reſolve againſt loſing a Second Miſtreſs for want of ſpeaking. He had Manners ſufficient (or rather Conſcience) to think he had given me enough of his <hi>Beau</hi>-ſelf for one Day, and withdrew.</p>
               <p>I could not forbear, late as it was, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you an Account: If you laugh in your Turn, I am paid for my Pains, as well as the Squire.

               <p>DO not you think I am more conſtant than your Friendſhip could hope, or mine pretend to? I think it a great Proof of it, amidſt the Fatigues of a Weſt-Country Journey, to give you thus duly an Account of my inſignificant ſelf, and Travels. We parted from <hi>Hartley-Row</hi> at Three this Morning, thro' a Croud of Beggars who watch our Coach for Alms; and will never leave it unbleſſed. Hence my <hi>Beau</hi> took Occaſion of <hi>Simile;</hi> bid me to obſerve how wakeful thoſe Wretches were for ſmall Charities, that he would do the like, in hopes of greater; and that my divine Idea had ſo filled his Sight, he could not reſolve to let Sleep intrude, for fear of ſhutting me out. I perceived he took Pains to be thought uneaſy, and I have more good Manners than to diſappoint him. Mrs. <hi>Mayoreſs,</hi> now ſhe is acquainted, has all the low, diſagreeable Familiarity of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of her Rank. She entertained us all the Morning with a ſorry Love-buſineſs

about her Second Huſband; Stuff ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, I remember nothing of it. <hi>Beau</hi> continues in his Aſſiduities: I think none was ever ſo plagued with dying Eyes; his are continually in that Poſture, and my Oppoſites, that I am forced to take a good deal of Pains to avoid them.

I never thought before that Dreſs was tolerable; but ſo wore, it ſeems a mighty Ornament.

High Prieſt of the Sun. The Canon gave me Cauſe to think he had dined too well, and was obliged to his Snuff, more than Religion, for keeping him awake. Well, Devotion done, I was forced to break up mine, and leave him without a Knowledge of his Conqueſt. As we were walking to our Inn, I aſked <hi>Beau</hi> what we ſhould do to paſs the next Day without being very weary of each other, for <hi>Sunday</hi> does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Travelling. He (you may be ſure) did not fail to tell me, he could never be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of me, tho' (himſelf) expiring by my Sight and Cruelty. I waved his Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and told him my Deſign of engaging the People in the <hi>Exeter</hi> Coach (if they ſeemed worth it) to live with us for the Time. When we returned, we were told it was not yet come in, occaſioned by the breaking of the Axle-tree five Miles off; but that a Fellow was gone to mend it, and they were expected every Moment. My Chamber-Window anſwered the Court; I roſe to it at the Noiſe of the Coach, and preſently ſaw alight, a tall, bluſtering, big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon'd, raw Thing, like an over-grown School-Boy, but conceited above any Thing. He had an Appurtenance, called a <hi>Wife,</hi> whom he ſuffered to get out as well as ſhe could. As long as he had lain by her, he did not think her worth the Civility of his Hand.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0104100603:91"/>
She ſeemed a Giant of a Woman, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine, with a right Cit's Air. He bluſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed preſently for the beſt Lodging, which he ſaw taken up by her that held the fine Fan before her Face: You may gueſs this was your humble Servant. The Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain told him, it was their Cuſtom, firſt come, firſt ſerved; but that there were very good Chambers beſides. The reſt of the Company were <hi>two</hi> Things that looked pert and aukward; Tradeſmens Daughters I judged them. But methoughts, caſting my Eyes upon a Gentlewoman and her Servant, that came out laſt, I found ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pleaſed me; whether it were becauſe ſhe really deſerved it, or that the Stuff ſhe was with ſet her off. I had a Baſin of fine Heart-Cherries before me, juſt come from the Garden: I cauſed them to be brought after me into the Gallery, and deſigned them as a Bait to the Woman whom I was to begin the Acquaintance with; for <hi>Beau</hi> deſigned to ſet up to get a Fortune in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and was unwilling to ſhew any Irregularity; and I thought myſelf above their Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The firſt that appeared was the Wife, with a riſing Belly: This ſeemed a good Hint; I offered them to her, not knowing but ſhe might <hi>long.</hi> The Sight (I ſuppoſe) did not diſpleaſe her, for ſhe readily accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and eat very greedily. The Genteel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0104100603:92"/>
Lady had much to do to be perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As for the other <hi>two,</hi> they were gone to chuſe a Lodging. We preſently grew acquainted, taking Travellers Liberty, and ſupped together. But, ſhall I tell you! the Wife grew jealous of me. It ſeems, her Temper was ſuch; and her Huſband (no ſmall Man in his Country, though him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf juſt ſet up in Merchandizing at <hi>London;</hi> his Father, one of the Canons at <hi>Exeter:</hi>) thought he might carry all Hearts before him, as well as the Country-Laſſes. They were come from viſiting their Friends, and returning to their Houſe in <hi>London.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Stanhope</hi> (for that was the Lady's Name whom I liked) told me, I was not to count upon the Conqueſt, for he had given her <hi>Douceurs</hi> all the Way, and made her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream uneaſy, becauſe his Wife appeared to be ſuch. We grew into an Intimacy, and left the Company. My <hi>Beau</hi> was to me faithleſs and inconſtant. One of the aukward little Things I told you of, and who had a tolerable Face, was a Goldſmith's Daughter of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and acquainted with his Lady-Siſter; that began their Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. She ſeemed free and fond: He took the Hint, and applied himſelf to her; which I was very glad of. Mrs. <hi>Stanhope</hi> went with me to my Chamber; and after much Diſcourſe, offered Friendſhip, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0104100603:93"/>
mutual Knowledge of each other; ſhe gave me this Account of her laſt Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</p>
               <p>I came now from <hi>Falmouth, (ſays ſhe)</hi> where I have been ever ſince the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Spring, to viſit a Brother and his Wife who live there. Until within theſe ſix Weeks I ſaw nothing that pleaſed me: At laſt it was a Captain of a Man of War had the Chance; my Brother brought him to his Houſe: And for my Excuſe, I muſt tell you, he is a very pretty, genteel young Gentleman, of a good Family and Education, and in Proſpect of coming to very good Fortune. They talked of the Town and Country Beauties: At laſt, a young Creature was named, whom I had not ſeen; but the Captain ſet her before every thing he had. I was concerned at his Opinion, and aſked him his of the Ducheſs of <hi>Grafton?</hi> He gave her due Praiſe; but yet in his Eſteem, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. I could not but think him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly in the Wrong; and was angry when I heard him wiſh himſelf a Man of mighty Fortune, to deſerve her. He ſailed that Night; and after ten Days Cruiſe, came in again. His firſt Viſit was to me. I aſked him if he had ſeen his Miſtreſs? He ſaid he had none. I remembred him of what he had ſpoke. He anſwered, that I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0104100603:94"/>
had taught him better. He continued his Applications, viſited me three Times a Day: And becauſe I was ſtill jealous of his Words, I had him watched, and an Account brought of all his Viſits. The young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's Uncle made a Ball; but becauſe my Brother and he were not well together, there was no Hopes of my being invited; which my Lover very well knew, and therefore ſaid, he would not be there, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received Orders to ſail. He took his Leave with tranſporting Sorrow; and had the Glory to find mine was real. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I would not loſe the Ball, becauſe I deſired to ſee my reputed Rival. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to tell you he had never ſeen her but once, when he praiſed her to that Degree; and dexterouſly told me, a ſecond Sight had undeceived him. I dreſſed myſelf like a Farmer's Wife, with a Baſket on my Arm; and by the Help of one of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, was placed like a Country Gazer at the Corner of the Room. I needed not to be told my Rival, a thouſand dazzling Charms diſtinguiſhed her; and tho' I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with jealous Eyes, muſt acknowledge I never ſaw any Beauty more perfect. All my Hopes lay in a certain Softneſs, which did not promiſe much Wit. In a little Time my Traytor (whom I imagined in the wide Ocean) came to the Ball, danced
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0104100603:95"/>
with his Miſtreſs, and was as aſſiduous as ſhe deſerved. I was ſo well pleaſed at the Diſcovery, I ſtayed not for any more, for fear I ſhould not eſcape myſelf. About Midnight he came (for a Minute) to ſee me, and told me he was juſt come aſhore, the Ship under Sail; yet without another Sight, it was impoſſible for him to depart. I confounded him with telling him what had ſo lately paſſed at the Ball: Yet he drew himſelf out of the Embarraſs, and ſaid every thing to make me think he loved me; and we were ſeriouſly treating upon the Affair of Matrimony. I told him he muſt get my Father's Conſent who lived at <hi>London,</hi> where I was going. He begged me to defer my Journey till he came in; which I too readily promiſed; and ſo we parted. I knew my Fortune fairer than my Rival's, and began to be perſuaded I had the better of her. For, what elſe could draw him to addreſs me? When I ſaw him return, it was with mutual Joy: But he was ordered that ſame Night to ſail to <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and did not expect to be back in a Week; therefore we agreed upon my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. He ſwore an inviolable Love, and would have contracted himſelf, if I durſt, without my Father's Conſent: He intended to write to his Friends above to aſk it. And thus we once more parted, but not till he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0104100603:96"/>
had ſeverely exclaimed againſt any Deſigns upon my Rival, before a whole Crew of Town-Goſſips, that I was ſure would tell her. You may conclude we agreed upon Writing. I took my Journey, and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at an Aunt's Houſe in <hi>Exeter</hi> Ten Days; where I heard that within Four of my Departure, my Lover returned; and in three more was publickly married to my Rival. I wrote to thank him for ridding me of a knaviſh Huſband, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him Joy, took Coach, and reſolved againſt too eaſily believing any Man again.</p>
               <p>The Poſt has juſt brought me a Letter from you: I find you curſe me with the Continuation of <hi>Egham</hi> Uneaſineſs, till I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to (the World in) <hi>London.</hi> Methinks it is unreaſonable to impoſe the continued Slavery of Writing: I aſſure you, I ſhall take Truce with it till at my Journey's End, unleſs ſomething happen worth your Notice.

               <head>LETTER VI.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>BEAU</hi> is now grown ſo <hi>inſipid,</hi> that I ſhall ſay very little of him for the future; and I have Reaſon to believe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>ſuch</hi> to him; for theſe two laſt Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (contrary to Cuſtom) he has not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed: The Fatigue which he ſeems more ſenſible of than any of us, has tarniſhed the Luſtre of his Eyes; and inſtead of any farther Ogleing, drowns all his amorous Pretenſions in as profound Sleep as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy Jolting of the Coach will permit. This is what I can never be ſo happy to gain. But to tell you ſomething of our laſt Night's Entertainment: Whilſt Supper was getting ready, the Gentleman I told you of, at <hi>Beau</hi>'s Intreaty, gave us an Account of what Affairs were carrying him to <hi>London:</hi> The ſhort of it is this,</p>
               <p>Your Ladyſhip <hi>(ſays he)</hi> may ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by my Accent, that I am a Foreigner. I had the Glory of following the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (now our auſpicious King) in his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0104100603:100"/>
Expedition into <hi>England.</hi> We landed in the Weſt, with all thoſe Particulars, which are needleſs to repeat. During our Stay at <hi>Exeter,</hi> I rendered my conſtant Devotion at the Cathedral; and in coming thence one Evening, an old Woman (with a Look as mean as a Beggar) preſented me a Letter; which when I had opened, I found from an Unknown, who ſtiled himſelf my Friend, and gave me this Advice, that a Lady of good Country-Quality and Fortune (and who was then in <hi>Exeter</hi>) was going to be diſpoſed of by her Mother to a Man ſhe no way affected: But that ſhe had been heard to ſay, <hi>If the handſome</hi> Switzer <hi>were in his Place, ſhe ſhould obey without Reluctancy.</hi> And concluded the Letter with giving me Advice, like a good Friend, to improve my growing Fortune; for ſo conſiderable an one as Twelve Thouſand Pounds was not every Day thrown into a Soldier's Lap. I had forgot to tell your Ladyſhip the Letter was writ in <hi>French,</hi> the Lady's Name, and Directions to her Lodgings. My Heart gave me a ſecret Preſage that the Matter would not be lucky to me, which I follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore took no Notice of the Letter. Three Days after, the ſame old Woman brought me another, much more preſſing: Upon which I gave myſelf blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up to my Deſtiny. I viſited, and found
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0104100603:101"/>
the Lady, tho' not a Beauty, yet genteel and taking. It was eaſy to gueſs by my Reception, that the Letters came from her. I will omit the Diſcourſe we had, and only reſt upon Matter of Fact. She obliged me to leave my Command, and go with her to her Eſtate. Her Mother looked upon me with an evil Eye, but my Miſtreſs was tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly kind, and much concerned that none of the Miniſters round durſt marry us, for fear of the old Lady. Whereupon we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded I ſhould pretend to take my Leave, as deſingning for <hi>London;</hi> but inſtead of that, go directly into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where ſhe had a conſiderable Eſtate, and would meet me. The Matter happened as we agreed; but for fear her Mother ſhould purſue us, ſhe conſented to <hi>take me for her Husband,</hi> before the Parſon could be got to make us <hi>ſuch.</hi> That happy Night I had all the Reaſon in the World to believe myſelf agreeable to her; and all was confirmed in the Morning by the Prieſt. Thus careſſed and bleſſed, we returned to her Houſe. The old Lady (who had no Command of her Daughter's Fortune, and ſaw the Buſineſs beyond Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy) was one of the firſt to make her Court to me, and wiſh me Joy. Three happy Months I had all the Satisfaction that innocent Marriage and exceſſive Love in a Bride, could give me. Then I began
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0104100603:102"/>
to conſider a little my Affairs, and propoſed to my Wife my being naturalized, that I might look after hers. She ſwooned at the Name; and when ſhe recovered, ſhe ſnatched a Bayonet of mine, and wounded herſelf under the Left Breaſt, but not much. I cannot expreſs my Surprize: We huſhed the Matter for fear of her Mother; and I employed ſome of my Soldiery Skill to cure it, which had the Effect. I enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Reaſon of this Extravagancy. She told me the Diſcovery of <hi>Intereſt</hi> in me, when ſhe had believed <hi>Love</hi> was the only Motive of our <hi>Marriage.</hi> Some Days paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and as often as I offered at it, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch mighty Diſguſt, that I reſolved to get it done without her Notice; for ſhe took me not as a Huſband, but a Lover. It was true, I was received as a Gueſt, but not a Maſter; and my Circumſtance (hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left my Command) required that. I got her Leave for my Journey: She ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch extravagant Paſſion at our Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I ſwore a ſpeedy Return; and reſolved to leave my Naturalization depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, look after my other Affairs and return within a Fortnight to her: But before that Time I had a dangerous Fit of Sickneſs at <hi>London.</hi> I wrote often to her, and gave her an Account that the <hi>Act was paſſed,</hi> and I could now happily call myſelf an
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0104100603:103"/>
                  <hi>Engliſh</hi> Husband. She only anſwered, She knew how to interpret it; but ſhe was out in her Cunning, if I ſhould find an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wife at my Service, who knew not the true Value and Uſe of one. This Letter damped me; but truſting to the Greatneſs of that Power Love had given me in her Heart, I did not queſtion but my Preſence would make all Things eaſy. I took Poſt, my Impatience would not ſtay the Coach, tho' the Remains of my Fever ſeemed to expect it. I gave myſelf no Reſt during the whole Journey. I ſent to give her No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of my Arrival: but what was my Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, to find all ſhut at home! I called under her Window where I perceived Light: It was a heavy Night of Rain: I knocked at the Gates, and ſtormed, but all to no Purpoſe; I was glad to take up my Lodging in the Porch. At Six in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning an Under-Servant appeared: I aſked for her Lady. She told me ſhe was gone none knew whether, and had conveyed away her Plate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that, if I pleaſed, an empty Houſe was at my Service. I calmly bore all this, imagining it but a Tryal, ſought her round the Country, but in vain; ſhe often ſhifted Places, and went diſguiſed. Not long after, ſhe commenced a <hi>Proceſs</hi> againſt me, and by a Pretence (which will for ever make her notorious)
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0104100603:104"/>
rendered me to the Court as <hi>Incapable.</hi> I was ſtill ſo tender of her Fame, as to ſuffer the Aſperſion. Common Law ſeparted us: She got the better, by my refuſing to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate myſelf; and I Fifteen Hundred Pounds of her Fortune and the Charges of the Court. It is ſince laſt <hi>Auguſt</hi> that this has happened. I have vainly tried to remove her implacable Averſion, or to learn the Cauſe of it: But I ſee my Endeavours are all fruitleſs; and I am now going to leave <hi>England</hi> (I think) for ever.</p>
               <p>I complimented him upon his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and really, in my Opinion, he could not be deſerving of them. 'Gad, Madam, (<hi>ſays</hi> Beau) ſee what inconſtant Things you Ladies are! I happened to be at this Gentleman's Houſe when he was firſt married, and never ſaw any thing ſo fond of him as his Wife. 'Gad, I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve whatever Woman I make happy, tho' her Eſteem be equal to my Merit, ſhe can poſſibly be fonder.</p>

            <head>A LETTER FROM A NUN in <hi>Portugal,</hi> TO A GENTLEMAN in <hi>France.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>OH my <hi>fled Heart!</hi> and he that ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly keeps it from me! Was not your barbarous Reſolution ſufficient that I ſhould never poſſeſs <hi>Yours;</hi> but you muſt add the Uſe of all your beſt Art to keep me from my <hi>Own?</hi> In what Diſorder do I ſpeak and write, for want of <hi>a poor tender Heart!</hi> That is gone a Pilgrimage to Love, and (the unkind Heavens not hearing its Prayer) has thro' Diſtraction loſt its Way, and never will return again? Fire fets on
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0104100603:111"/>
Fire: Why then does not my Flame make you burn? It is a falſe Maxim: <hi>Extremity of Cold ſcorches.</hi> Had I at firſt put on a Behaviour more cool and remote to your pretended Affection, and treated you with Unkindneſs, how many Bows and Vows would you have offered at <hi>Love's-Altar?</hi> With what Ardency would you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued your Proteſtations? Who would have thought that a Fire (at firſt) ſo well kindled as yours, ſhould need Fanning with an infectious Blaſt to preſerve its Heat? Or that the wholſome Sun ſhould put it out? But that alas! was my Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune: My Burning was the greater, and drew yours away.—How can I then with any Confidence blame you, for what I myſelf was truly and principally the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of? You too eaſily perceived how earneſtly I was wont to watch your Eyes, that they looked not on others; as if mine took it unkindly they were not gazed on altogether. How perverſe are our Fates! Why elſe was it not contrived that you might be as happy in me, as it was poſſible for me to be in you? Say what you will, you was to blame. What Care you took to aſſault my Affections, was ſufficiently diſcoverable in the conſtant Ardour and Formality of your Approaches; contriving to appear at all Times as engaging as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0104100603:112"/>
Your Conqueſt was not ſo great: You could not well have met with a Heart leſs fortified for a Defence: Ye Gods! that I ſhould yield upon your very <hi>firſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;</hi> and ſo diſhonourably, that I was not allowed <hi>Flying Colours!</hi> Nay, what is yet more, that I ſhould bear ſo mean, ſo low, and ſo contemptible a Spirit, as to take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more Delight in my own Captivity and Vaſſallage, than in the moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tranquillity! What do I thus rave up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? What would I have? If I am happy in my Condition, why do I not reſt and retain my Senſes like others of my Sex? But that ſtill (and I fear ever) I have the ſame ſad Tune to ſing;</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>My Conqueror (whom I adored for being ſo) is gone; and my Cloyſter is now as much a Priſon to me, as it was Heaven, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and all Things, when I had him there. It was an unworthy Thing to ſteal my better Part, my Soul, away, and not think this little Frame, its old Companion, worth taking with you. But what you had got, you thought was of light Carriage, needed little Stowage, paid no Freight, and (I dare ſtake my Life) was the All you ever intended to have of me: And to be ſo ſerved, is (it ſeems) the All I am ever likely to expect from you. How groſly did I flatter myſelf, and abuſe you,</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0104100603:113"/>
                  <hi>whenever I imagined you would be kind and true to me! You that are ſo cruel, that could you reduce any other Woman into my ill Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, if there was a Third in the World, you would certainly leave the former, and there feign freſh Adorations. If there was not, yet purely to gratify your Inhumanity to her, even I, now ſlighted and neglected, ſhould then have your Company; for you could not brook being put by a Pleaſure of that Kind, though it coſt you the Trouble of going to one who loved you more than the World.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>How very odd (and as tho' you were writing to ſome public Place of Intelligence) was that <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> of yours in your laſt Letter! <hi>concerning the great Lightning and Thunder which you ſay happened in your Parts!</hi> Alſo, <hi>you deſire to know what Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have had here.</hi> Are theſe proper Enquiries for a Love-Letter? Truly it might have <hi>Thundered, Lightened,</hi> and <hi>Rained,</hi> or it might have been very <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant delightful Weather</hi> for aught I know; for I am not capable of making any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks of that kind: But this I can inform you, being too ſure of the Truth of it, that it has been very <hi>ſtormy Weather</hi> in my <hi>Eyes</hi> ever ſince your Departure; and until you return (the only <hi>Sun,</hi> whoſe Influence
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0104100603:114"/>
can diſperſe theſe <hi>Clouds</hi>) I fear it will ever be <hi>Tempeſtuous.</hi> This Account (it may be) pleaſes you more than if I had ſent you Word the ill <hi>Weather</hi> had reached our Country, demoliſhed our Monaſtery, ſet me at Liberty, and I was in Purſuit of you. Then, then, how I would glut my Revenge by the Incurſions of my Love! For it ſhould hunt you in all Places and all Countries. And ſince it wore ſo much the Viſage of an evil Spirit in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit here, as to make you quit the Spot, I would try whether Change of Air would alter its Complection and Features, ſo as to force you into a better Opinion of it, and be thoroughly revenged on you that Way: For <hi>to love,</hi> I find is the Unhappineſs you would avoid above all other things: But your Appetite and Taſte is as much depraved as my Project is vain and imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable: I find the Sour of <hi>France</hi> gratifies your Palate above the Sweets of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and a <hi>French</hi> LADY (with her diſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards to your Addreſs, and, at laſt, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit artificial Acceptance) ſhall engage you much more than the Loyalty, Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Truth and Freedom of my unlimited Paſſion. Will not the World ſwear we are both mad? You for preferring a Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, (becauſe it gliſters, before the true Metal itſelf, which is known to every
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0104100603:115"/>
Child by its Weight:) I for my Fidelity to ſo much Ingratitude. But let the World blame us as it pleaſes, I am reſolved to be as true to you, as you to your natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy. To what a Degree of Bliſs ſhould I be advanced, if I could find you complaining of the Remiſſneſs of my Love, and admiring the Intenſeneſs of your own: Then I ſhould be but too happy if that Fault was not found on your Side, as alas! to all the World too viſibly it is: And the ſame Conceptions you make of an Immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, will but juſt ſerve you to fathom my Zeal, which (although cheriſhed and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after the moſt careful Manner) is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of nothing but the moſt bitter, ſour, and unpleaſant Fruits imaginable.—Your unkind Dealings and Actions to me, are the Fruits of my extraordinary Paſſion. What Soul could imagine ſuch diſſonant Notes ſhould ſtrike, to interrupt the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of my Affection? In what had you been the worſe, had you retaliated my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Kindneſs with but a little of yours; and although more than a little be my Due, yet with the leaſt Grain I could have wrought my own Contentment: But you are ſo unjuſt to deny all, and leave me to a racking and a miſerable Deſpair; one Hour's Torment of which, I would not wiſh you ſhould endure Ages to come, to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0104100603:116"/>
be ſet free myſelf; and yet no otherwiſe fond of my Condition, but as it is a Gift of yours, and which (for any Thing leſs than your Love) I will never part with. O! barbarous, barbarous Man! to deny me that which you take more Pains to throw away upon another, than I can do to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. You ſhall not uſe me thus; indeed you muſt not: It is I ſay it, but you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not that, ſo inſenſible are you of my Condition; which though never ſo unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate as to my own particular, yet is ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated with Cares for your Welfare, who are the ſole Cauſe of my Unhappineſs. How you will reliſh this <hi>Letter</hi> I know not; I fear you will think there are too many Invectives againſt your Tyranny; in which I will agree with you myſelf, and aſk your Forgiveneſs: But alas! they are as gentle as I could poſſibly perſuade my Pen to drop; for ſince you take ſo much Pleaſure in a hard Heart, I would not for the World any ways croſs you, by making you leſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate; ſo tenderly I value your Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo little (for your ſake) my own. But oh! the infinite Pleaſures you would find in <hi>Love,</hi> if you thought them worth the looking after! <hi>Love</hi> (as it is, or is not mutual) is the trueſt Epitome of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural States: If mutual, the Joys are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and never cloy; if not, the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0104100603:117"/>
are intolerable, yet muſt be endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Oh! that any thing I could ſay might diſſolve you to a Senſe of my miſerable Life; or, indeed rather your own! And yet if it could in the leaſt enter into my Thoughts, that you are altogether at Repoſe, I aſſure you, I would never interrupt you; no Noiſe of my Afflictions ſhould ever be your Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance: But I am very much miſtaken, if you are altogether without Remorſe for the Sufferings you have brought upon me. I remember you once was flexible, and of a compaſſionate Nature, and your Behaviour very like a Gentleman; whatever has miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided you to the Abuſe of my Favours, which (if I have Knowledge of my Heart) were at firſt, much more for your ſake than my own, you were the Aggreſſor, and not I; and whatever Kindneſs I ſhewed you, was more to make me happy, than your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; that by Charity to a Serpent, I at laſt was ſtung. It is ſaid that venomous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have a balſamick Quality in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to cure the Wounds they make: But you (more unnatural than all the reſt) have none; at leaſt, moſt cruelly you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it from me. Oh Heaven! that I had but Power to contain myſelf! that I had but Temper to be a little calm! But it is a Condition I have long ſince abandoned, and (till I ſee you again) will never re-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0104100603:118"/>
In the Rage I am in, I could think in you as many Unkindneſſes, as by and by the Fury of Love would find a Taſk to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel; for if one Half Hour I blame you, in the next I call it Injuſtice. So careful am I, that no ill Thought of you appear deſerving, that were you worſe than you are, my Pleaſure would conſiſt in being flattered that you are better than I think you: Nay, ſometimes I perſuade myſelf that you are a Man of the greateſt Juſtice in the World; and that it is not even in your Nature (wilfully) to do an unequal Thing. But it is moſt certain, I am doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a fruitleſs Love, without the leaſt Poſſibility of a Deliverance. Indeed, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I had a faint Proſpect (as I thought) of being in ſome meaſure reſtored; but I looked through falſe Opticks, that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with a wrong Object; and ſince that, I have done the great Work, of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be well ſatisfied with my intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condition. Did my Love run parallel with what is commonly found in the World, it would not be ſo deſperate.—Happy they, who (in a Pet, or upon ſome ſmall Diſguſt) can recede from their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſet up for new Ones elſewhere; and whatever they pretend, Self-Intereſt is the greateſt Thing. This is the Way of Amouring moſt in Faſhion: This is that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0104100603:119"/>
Impoſture which prevails upon ſo many tender Hearts: And in Caſes of Denial, very artificially can uſurp languiſhing Eyes, want no expreſſive Inſinuations, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Melancholy and Diſtraction; and all to ſerve ſome baſe Bye-End. If this had been the Quality of my Love, the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance you aſſign me had then been me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited. I verily believe, if it had had but the leaſt Tincture of Treachery, I ſhould have won your Heart, ſhould have made you jealous: And that Temper would have been very inconſiſtent with your Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to make a thorough Conqueſt: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than which (to a Man of Proweſs like you) could have been a real Pleaſure. Yes, yes; it is very plain, if my Paſſion had been forged, and bore a falſe Accent, it would certainly much better have agreed with yours, as being much nearer related; but the fatal Conſequence (of a true Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, returned with fair Aſſurances, and foul Actions) none knows but the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſolitary I. Upon the whole, I think verily I love you, becauſe you make me miſerable. If that be true, go on, be ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized to the World for your Unkindneſs, that the more I may be ſo, for my unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Affection. That I love you, Heaven knows; you know elſe I ſhould ſee you here again, cringing out the feigned
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0104100603:120"/>
Allegations of your Sincerity, though much more diſtant than we are. O, that we were to begin again! What Courſe would I then take! I fear, even fool myſelf, as I have done; for ſince I know no greater Pleaſure than the Love of you, I ſhould too willingly run the Riſque of any Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that could happen by it. I die a thouſand Deaths every Hour, and ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, to die them over again: Adieu. What could I not endure for your ſake? I have at this Moment ſo lively an <hi>Idea</hi> of you, that I almoſt fancy you here in Perſon. Methinks, how very kind you are! How affectionately you condole me for the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I have ſuffered in your Abſence; and how thankful I am to you for them! How you preſs my Hand, and ſwear you will never part with me! And Ah, <hi>Monſieur!</hi> How I believe you, for being hitherto ſo faithful!—Once more Adieu. I think I never writ Letters to you in my Life, but their Length made them ſtayed for. The Poſt (at my Requeſt) has waited a great while, and I am now ſent to; I wonder elſe, when I ſhould give over. You may judge a little of my Condition, when you ſee even hurrying-Poſt-haſte itſelf can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a Delay to pleaſe me. The Actions of all People that ſee me, are deſignedly kind, and of a Deſire to divert me. One takes
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0104100603:121"/>
me by the Hand, begging of me to be chearful, and leave my unprofitable Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſhewing me good Reaſon for it: But, alas! I find <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> two very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Things, not at all influencing each other. To-day a <hi>Siſter</hi> brought me Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the beſt Fruits; of which, nothing but a Piece of a <hi>Pomgranate,</hi> could I be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to eat. I might thank her, but I am not ſure I had ſo much Manners: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body excuſes my ill Breeding, but much wonder at my Alteration. The Rigour and Severity of our Religion can diſpenſe with many great Faults in me, that it will not allow in others. What ſhall I do? Well, I have only one Thing more (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a Thouſand) to ſay to you; which is, That if you can have Regard for any <hi>one</hi> Sentence in this long Letter; it may be to <hi>this</hi> laſt, <hi>I implore you to let me ſee you in</hi> Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal <hi>before I die.</hi> Adieu, Adieu.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OUR having no Proſpect of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a Commiſſion for me, can no way alter or cool my Deſire at this important Junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to venture my Life in ſome Manner or other, for my King and my Country.</p>
               <p>I cannot bear living under the Reproach of lying obſcure and idle in a Country Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0104100603:124"/>
when every Man, who has the leaſt Senſe of Honour, ſhould be preparing for the Field.</p>
               <p>You may remember, Sir, with what Reluctance I ſubmitted to your Commands upon <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Rebellion, when no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity could prevail with you to permit me to leave the Academy; I was too young to be hazarded; but give me Leave to ſay, it is glorious at any Age to die for one's Country, and the ſooner, the nobler the Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>I am now older by three Years; my Uncle <hi>Bathe</hi> was not ſo old, when he was left among the Slain at the Battle of <hi>Newbury:</hi> Nor you yourſelf, Sir, when you make your Eſcape from your Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to join your Brother at the Defence of <hi>Scilly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame Cauſe is now come round about again: The King has been miſ-led; let thoſe who have miſ-led him be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for it: Nobody can deny, but he is Sacred in his own Perſon, and it is every honeſt Man's Duty to defend it.</p>
               <p>You are pleas'd to ſay, it is yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, if the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are raſh enough to make ſuch an Attempt: But be that as it will, I beg Leave to inſiſt upon it, that I may be preſented to his Majeſty, as one, whoſe utmoſt Ambition it is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote

               <p>The Gentry aſſembled at <hi>York,</hi> to agree upon the Choice of Repreſentatives for the County, have prepared an Addreſs, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his Majeſty, they are ready to ſacrifice their Lives and Fortunes for him, upon this, and all other Occaſions; but at the ſame Time, they humbly beſeech him to give them ſuch Magiſtrates, as may be agreeable to the Laws of the Land; for at preſent, there is no Authority to which they can legally ſubmit.</p>
               <p>They have been beating for Volunteers at <hi>York,</hi> and the Towns adjacent, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Regiments at <hi>Hull,</hi> but nobody will liſt.</p>
               <p>By what I can hear, every body wiſhes well to the King, but they would be glad, his Miniſters were hang'd.</p>
               <p>The Winds continue ſo contrary, that no Landing can be ſo ſoon as was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; therefore, I may hope, with your Leave and Aſſiſtance, to be in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs before any Action can begin.</p>

               <p>This, my dear Lord, is a Preparative to bring you upon the Stage with ſome Luſtre at your firſt Appearance in the World. You
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0104100603:128"/>
are placed at the Head of a Body of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, entirely diſpos'd in Affection to you, and your Family: You are born poſſeſs'd of all thoſe amiable Qualities, which cannot fail of fixing their Hearts: You have no other Example to follow, but to tread in the Steps of your Anceſtors: It is all that is hoped or deſired from you.</p>
               <p>You are upon an uncommon Foundation in that Part of the World: Your Anceſtors, for at leaſt five hundred Years, never made any Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, Male or Female, out of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Counties: Thus there is hardly a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, either in <hi>Cornwall</hi> or <hi>Devon,</hi> but has ſome of your Blood, or you ſome of theirs. I remember, the firſt Time I accompany'd your Grandfather into the <hi>Weſt,</hi> upon hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Parliament of <hi>Tinners,</hi> as Warden of the <hi>Stannaries,</hi> when there was the moſt numerous Appearance of Gentry of both Counties, that had ever been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd together; I obſerv'd there was hardly any one but whom he call'd <hi>Couſin;</hi> and I could not but obſerve, at the ſame Time, how well they were pleaſed with it. Let this be a Leſſon for you, when it comes to your Turn to appear amongſt them. Nothing is more obliging, than to ſeem to retain the Memory of Kindred and Allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, tho' never ſo remote: And by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, nothing more diſobliging, than a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0104100603:129"/>
Forgetfulneſs of them; which is always imputed to an affected, diſdainful Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Pride.</p>
               <p>There is another Particular, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, of no ſmall Conſequence to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of your Intereſt, which I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to your Imitation; and that is, to make <hi>Stowe</hi> your principal Reſidence. I have heard your Grandfather ſay, if ever he liv'd to be poſſeſs'd of <hi>New-Hall,</hi> he would pull it down, that your Father might have no Temptation to withdraw from the ancient Seat of his Family. From the <hi>Conqueſt</hi> to the <hi>Reſtauration,</hi> your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors conſtantly reſided amongſt their Countrymen, except when the public Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice call'd upon them to ſacrifice their Lives for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stowe</hi> in my Grandfather's Time, till the Civil Wars broke out, was a Kind of Academy for all the young Men of Family in the Country: He provided himſelf with the beſt Maſters of all Kinds for Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the Children of his Neighbours and Friends ſhared the Advantage with his own. Thus he, in a Manner, became the Father of his Country; and not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the Affection of the preſent Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but laid a Foundation of Friendſhip for Poſterity, which is not worn out at this Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0104100603:130"/>
Upon this Foundation, my Lord, you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit Friends without the Trouble of make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and have only to preſerve them: an eaſy Taſk for you, to whom Nature has been ſo liberal of every Quality ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to attract Affection, and gain the Heart!</p>
               <p>I muſt tell you, the Generality of our Countrymen have been always <hi>Royaliſts;</hi> you inherit too much Loyal Blood to like them the worſe. There is an old Saying amongſt them, That a <hi>Godolphin</hi> was never known to want Wit; a <hi>Trelawney,</hi> Courage; or a <hi>Granville,</hi> Loyalty. Wit and Courage are not to be miſtaken; and to give thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies their Due, they ſtill keep up to their Character: But it is the Misfortune of Loyalty, not to be ſo clearly underſtood or defined. In a Country, ſubject to Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, what paſſes for Loyalty To-day, may be Treaſon To-morrow; but I make great Difference between Real and Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Treaſon. In the Quarrel of the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> both Sides were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Traitors, as the other prevailed: Even under <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Uſurpation, all who adhered to the King were proclaimed Traitors, and ſuffered as ſuch; but this makes no Alteration in the Thing itſelf: It may be enacted Treaſon to call black, black; or white, white: But black will
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0104100603:131"/>
be black, and white will be white, in Spite of all the Legiſlators in the World.</p>
               <p>There can be no Doubt about Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, unleſs Princes become Tyrants, and then they ceaſe to be Kings: They will no longer be reſpected as God's Vicegerents, who violate the Laws they were ſworn to protect. The Preacher may tell us of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience; that Tyrants are to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently ſuffer'd, as Scourges in the Hands of a righteous God, to chaſtiſe a ſinful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to be ſubmitted to, like Plagues, Famines, and ſuch like Judgments from above. Such Doctrine, were it true, could only ſerve to miſlead ill-judging Princes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a falſe Security; Men are not to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd out of their Senſes: Human Nature, and Self-Preſervation, will eternally arm againſt Slavery and Oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>It is therefore not to be ſuppoſed, that even the weakeſt Prince would run that Hazard, unleſs ſeduced by Advice, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly palliated by evil Counſellors. <hi>Nero</hi> himſelf, under the Influence of a good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, was the mildeſt, the moſt gracious, and beſt beloved of the Emperors: The moſt ſanguinary, the moſt profligate, and the moſt abhorr'd under a bad one. A Prince may be deceiv'd, or miſtaken in the Choice of his Favourites; but he has this
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0104100603:132"/>
Advantage, he is ſure to hear of it from the Voice of the Public: if then he is deaf, he ſeems to take upon himſelf the Blame and Odium of thoſe Actions which were chargeable before but upon his Adviſers.</p>
               <p>Idle Murmurs, groundleſs Diſcontents, and pretended Jealouſies and Fears, the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of private Prejudice and Reſentments, have been, and will ever be, under the wiſeſt Adminiſtrations: We are peſter'd with them even now, when we have a <hi>Queen,</hi> who is known to have nothing ſo much at Heart, as the Contentment of her People: Theſe are tranſitory Vapours, which ſcatter at the firſt Appearance of Light: The Infection ſpreads no farther than a particular Set of four, ſplenetic <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> in Politics, not worth minding or correcting. Univerſal Diſcontent can never happen but from ſolid Provocations.</p>
               <p>Many well-meaning Perſons however, abounding in Zeal, have been often unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily caught by popular Pretences, and not undeceived, till it was too late. Have a Care, my dear Couſin, of ſplitting upon that Rock: There have been <hi>falſe Patriots,</hi> as well as <hi>falſe Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>Fear God, and Honour the King,</hi> were Injunctions ſo cloſely tack'd together, that they ſeem to make but one and the ſame Command: A Man may as well pretend
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0104100603:133"/>
to be a good Chriſtian, without fearing God, as a good Subject without honouring the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deo, Patrice, Amicis,</hi> was your Great-Grandfather Sir <hi>Bevil</hi>'s Motto: In three Words he has added to his Example a Rule, which in following you can never err in any Duty of Life. The brighteſt Carriage, and the gentleſt Diſpoſition, is Part of the Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi>'s Character of him; ſo much of him you may have begun to ſhew us already; and the beſt Wiſh I can make for you, is to reſemble him as much in all—but his untimely Fate.</p>

               <p>EVery living Creature, my dear Lord, is entitled to Offices of Humanity: The Diſtreſs, even of an Enemy, ſhould reconcile us to him: If he thirſts, give him Drink; if he hungers, give him Food; overcome Evil with Good. It is with this Diſpoſition I would have you enter into the Exerciſe of that Authority, [<hi>Lord-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of</hi> Cornwall] with which her Majeſty has honoured you over your Countrymen. Let no body inſpire you with Party-Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and Reſentments. Let it be your Buſineſs to reconcile Differences, and heal Diviſions; and to reſtore, if poſſible, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and good Neighbourhood amongſt them: If then there ſhould be any left to wiſh you ill, make them aſham'd and confounded with your Goodneſs and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration:
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0104100603:135"/>
Not that I would ever adviſe you to ſacrifice one Hair of the Head of an old Friend to your Family, to gain fifty new ones; but if you can encreaſe the Number by Curteſy and Moderation, it may be worth the Trial.</p>
               <p>Believe me, my dear Lord, Humanity and Generoſity make the beſt Foundation to build a Character upon: A Man may have Birth, and Riches, and Power, Wit, Learning, Courage; but without Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity it is impoſſible to be a great Man: Whatever the Rich and Powerful may think of themſelves, whatever Value they may ſet upon their Abundance and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, they will find themſelves but the more hated and deſpis'd for the ill Uſe they make of it.</p>
               <p>You ſhould look upon yourſelves but as Stewards and Truſtees for the Diſtreſſed: Your Over-abundance is but a Depoſit for the Uſe and Relief of the Unhappy; you are anſwerable for all Superfluities miſpent: It is not to be ſuppoſed that Providence would have made ſuch Diſtinctions among Men, ſuch unequal Diſtributions, but that they might endear themſelves to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by mutual Helps and Obligations. <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> is the ſureſt Cement of Love, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Society.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0104100603:136"/>
There are, indeed, Rules to be obſerv'd, and Meaſures to be kept, in the Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Favours. We know who have both the Power and Inclination to do Good, but for Want of Judgment in the Direction, they paſs only for good-natur'd Fools in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of generous Benefactors.</p>
               <p>My Lord—will grudge a Guinea to an honeſt Gentleman in Diſtreſs, but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily give twenty to a common Strumper. Another ſhall reſuſe to lend fifty Pounds to his beſt Friend without ſufficient Security, and the next Moment ſet his whole Fortune upon a Card or a Die; a Chance, for which he can have no Security. My Lord—is to be ſeen every Day at a Toy-Shop, ſquandring away his Money in Trinkets and Baubles; and at the ſame Time leaves his Brothers and Siſters without common Neceſſaries.</p>
               <p>Generoſity does not conſiſt in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Money, in throwing it away at Random, without Judgment or Diſtinction; tho' that indeed is better than locking it up, for Multitudes have the Benefit of it; but in a right Diſpoſition to proper Objects, in Proportion to the Merit, the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Rank, and Condition of thoſe, who ſtand in Need of our Service.</p>
               <p>Princes are more expoſed than any others to the miſplacing their Favours: Merit is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0104100603:137"/>
ever modeſt, and keeps its Diſtance: The Forward and Importunate ſtand always neareſt in Sight, and are not to be put out of Countenance, nor thruſt out of the Way.</p>
               <p>I remember to have heard a Saying of the late King <hi>James, That be never knew a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Man make his Way in a Court. David Floyd,</hi> whom you know, being then in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his Majeſty's Elbow, reply'd blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Pray, Sir, whoſe Fault's that?</hi> The King ſtood corrected, and was ſilent. If Princes could ſee with their own Eyes, and hear with their own Ears, what a happy Situation it would be both for themſelves and their Subjects? To reward Merit, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the Injured, to relieve the Oppreſſed, to raiſe the Modeſt, to humble the Inſolent; what a God-like Prerogative, were a right Uſe made of it!</p>
               <p>How happy are you, my dear Lord, who are born with ſuch generous Inclinations, with Judgment to direct them, and the Means to indulge them! Of all Men moſt miſerable is he, who has the Inclination, without the Means. To meet with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Object of Compaſſion, without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Power to give Relief, of all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in Life is the moſt diſagreeable: To have the Power is the greateſt Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>

               <p>WHEN I look upon the Date of your laſt Letter, I muſt own myſelf blameable for not having ſooner return'd you my Thanks for it.</p>
               <p>I approve very well of your Reſolution of dedicating yourſelf to the Service of God; you could not chuſe a better Maſter, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you have ſo ſufficiently ſearch'd your Heart as to be perſuaded you can ſerve him well: In ſo doing you may ſecure to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf many Bleſſings in this World, as well as a ſure Expectation in the next. There is one thing which I perceive you have not thoroughly purg'd yourſelf from, which is Flattery: You have beſtow'd ſo much of that upon me in your Letter, that I hope you have no more left, and that you meant it only to take your Leave of ſuch Flights of Fancy, which, however well meant, oftener put a Man out of Countenance than oblige him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0104100603:140"/>
You are now become a Searcher after Truth: I ſhall hereafter take it more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be juſtly reprov'd by you, than to be undeſervedly complimented.</p>
               <p>I would not have you underſtand me, as if I recommended to you a ſour Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Severity; that is yet more to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Advice, like Phyſick, ſhould be ſo ſweeten'd and prepar'd, as to be made pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or Nature may be apt to revolt againſt it. Be always ſincere, but at the ſame Time always polite: Be humble without deſcending from your Character; reprove and correct without offending good Manners: To be a Cynick is as bad as to be a Sycophant: You are not to lay aſide the Gentleman with your Sword, nor to put on the Gown to hide your Birth and good Breeding, but to adorn it. Such has been the Malice of the World, from the Beginning, that Pride, Avarice, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, have been charg'd upon the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in all Ages, in all Countries, and in all Religions. What they are moſt oblig'd to combat againſt in their Pulpits, they are moſt accus'd of encouraging in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. It behoves you therefore to be more upon your Guard in this, than in any other Profeſſion: Let your Example confirm your Doctrine; and let no Man ever have it in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0104100603:141"/>
his Power to reproach you with practiſing contrary to what you preach.</p>
               <p>You had an Uncle, Dr. <hi>Dennis Granville,</hi> Dean of <hi>Durham,</hi> whoſe Memory I ſhall ever revere; make him your Example: Sanctity ſate ſo eaſy, ſo unaffected, and ſo graceful upon him, that in him we beheld the very Beauty of Holineſs: He was as chearful, as familiar, and condeſcending in his Converſation, as he was ſtrict, regular and exemplary in his Piety: As well bred and accompliſh'd as a Courtier, as reverend and venerable as an Apoſtle: He was indeed in every Thing apoſtolical, for he abandon'd all to follow his Lord and Maſter.</p>
               <p>May you reſemble him; may he revive in you; may his Spirit deſcend upon you, as <hi>Elijah</hi>'s upon <hi>Eliſha;</hi> and may the great God of Heaven, in guiding, directing, and ſtrengthening your pious Reſolutions, pour down his beſt and choiceſt Bleſſings upon you.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Peruſal of this DIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOGUE, in DEFENCE of the FAIR SEX, written by a GENTLEMAN of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, much ſurprized me: For it was not eaſy for me to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that one ſo young, could have treated ſo nice a Subject with ſo much Judgment. It is true, I was not ignorant that he was naturally ingenious, and that he had improved himſelf by Travelling; and from thence I might reaſonably have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0104100603:146"/>
that Air of Gallantry, which is ſo viſibly diffuſed thro' the Body of the Work, and is indeed the Soul that animates all Things of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But ſo much Variety of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both in ancient and modern Authors, ſuch Digeſtion of that Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo much Juſtneſs of Thought, that it leaves no Room for Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Pedantry, I may venture to ſay, are not overcommon amongſt practiſed Writers, and very rarely to be found amongſt Beginners. It puts me in Mind of what was ſaid of Mr. <hi>Waller,</hi> the Father of our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Numbers, upon the Sight of his firſt Verſes, by the Wits of the laſt Age, that <hi>he came out into the World Forty Thouſand ſtrong, before they had heard of him.</hi> Here, in Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Friend's Apoſtrophes, I hope the Reader need not be told, that Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> is only mentioned for Honour's ſake, that I am deſirous
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0104100603:147"/>
of laying hold on his Memory, on all Occaſions, and thereby acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging to the World, that unleſs he <hi>had</hi> written, none of us <hi>could</hi> write. I know my Friend will forgive me this Digreſſion; for it is not only a Copy of his Stile, but of his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. The Reader will obſerve, that he is ready for all Hints of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending Merit, and the Writers of this Age and Country are particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to him, for his pointing out thoſe Paſſages which the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Beaux Endroits,</hi> wherein they have moſt excelled. And tho' I may ſeem in this, to have my own Intereſt in View, becauſe he has more than once mentioned me, ſo much to my Advantage, yet I hope the Reader will take it only for a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> becauſe the Piece would have been very perfect without it. I may be ſuffered to pleaſe myſelf with the Kindneſs of my Friend,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0104100603:148"/>
without valuing myſelf upon his Partiality: He had not Confidence enough to ſend it out into the World, without my Opinion of it, that it might paſs ſecurely, at leaſt amongſt the fair Readers, for whoſe Service it was principally deſigned. I am not ſo preſuming, to think my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion can either be his Touchſtone, or his Paſſport: But I thought I might ſend him back to <hi>Arioſto;</hi> who has made it the Buſineſs of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Thirty <hi>Stanzas</hi> in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the 37th Book of his <hi>Orlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Furioſo,</hi> not only to praiſe that beautiful part of the Creation, but alſo to make a ſharp Satire on their Enemies; to give Mankind their own, and to tell them plainly, that from their Envy it proceeds that the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and great Actions of Women are purpoſely concealed, and the Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſome few amongſt them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with all the aggravating Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0104100603:149"/>
of Malice. For my own Part, who have always been their Servant, and have never drawn my Pen againſt them, I had rather ſee ſome of them praiſed extraordinarily, than any of them ſuffer by Detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And that in this Age, and at this Time particularly, wherein I find more <hi>Heroines</hi> than <hi>Heroes.</hi> Let me therefore give them Joy of their new Champion: If any will think me more partial to him than really I am, they can only ſay I have returned his Bribe: And the worſt I wiſh him, is, that he may receive <hi>Juſtice</hi> from the <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> only from the <hi>Ladies.</hi>

Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> will have it, that the LADY characterized by Mr. <hi>Walſh</hi> under the Name of EUGENIA, was his Miſtreſs. For this he could not have any other ground than his own malevolent Conjecture. But that our Author was a Gentleman very ſuſceptable of the <hi>ſoft Paſſion,</hi> appears plainly from his own Pen; ſending forth his <hi>Love-Letters</hi> and <hi>Poems</hi> with the following <hi>Addreſs</hi> to the Public:<q>

                     <l>May find the Thing they never felt, by Me.</l>

However, from this time forward, upon what Follies ſoever you fall, be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for my ſake, to ſpare thoſe of Love; being very well ſatisfied, there is not one Folly of that kind (except Marriage) which I have not already committed. I have been, without Railery, in Love with the Beauty of a Woman whom I have never ſeen; with the Wit of one whom I never heard ſpeak, nor ſeen any thing that ſhe has written; and with the heroic Virtues of a Woman, without knowing any one Action of her Life, that could make me think ſhe had any.—<hi>Cupid</hi> will have it ſo; and what can weak Mortals do againſt ſo potent a God? Adieu; live pleaſantly, that is, <hi>philoſophically;</hi> and guard your <hi>Heart</hi> from the <hi>Pains of Love.</hi> Such were the Sentiments of our Author when about Thirty Years of Age.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a dangerous thing, MADAM, it muſt be confeſſed, this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with fair Ladies; and it draws us into Inconveniencies, of which we do not at firſt ſee the Conſequences. I little thought, when I talked with your Ladyſhip, of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of your Sex, that you would have commanded me to have given my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon that Subject in Writing. I grant you, <hi>Madam,</hi> you might have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0104100603:155"/>
to ſeveral of your Acquaintance, who would have undertaken the Buſineſs at firſt Word, with all the Courage imaginable; but to me, who never durſt take Pen in Hand to write any thing beyond a Billet, the Enterprize ſeems very terrible. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, when you ſpoke to me of it firſt, I was well enough pleaſed with the Deſign; for I thought a Defence of the Sex, would be a Means of obliging all of the Sex, who were worth defending; and therefore look'd upon it as the writing a Circular Love-Letter to all the fair Ladies in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But as Men generally mix Intereſt with Honour, ſo, upon ſecond Thoughts, I conſidered what I ſhould get by it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Fame, if it ſhould ſucceed; and I found, if I perſuaded all Men to be as paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Servants to the Ladies as myſelf, I ſhould make but a very indifferent hand of it: Thus, <hi>Madam,</hi> you would engage me in a Controverſy, where it would be a Scandal to be vanquiſhed, and a Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to overcome: For I, who could never ſucceed in an Amour where there was any Fool pretended beſides myſelf, ſhould have great Hopes indeed, when I had perſuaded all Mankind to be my Rivals. After all, <hi>Madam,</hi> there were your Commands to encourge me to it; and the Commands of a fair Lady are to me beyond all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0104100603:156"/>
in Nature; I therefore reſolved upon the Undertaking. But as it is no new thing to ſee People undertake a Buſineſs that they are altogether unable to perform, ſo I muſt own, I found a thing of this Nature quite beyond my Strength: You may believe, <hi>Madam,</hi> I was very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly at it, and it was then that a Friend coming into my Chamber, asked me the Occaſion. As I never love to conceal any thing that afflicts me from a Friend, ſo I preſently told him the Buſineſs, That a Lady had commanded me to write her a Treatiſe in Defence of Women. If that be all (ſays he briskly) I am come to your Deliverance; for this very Morning have I been at a Converſation, where the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion concerning the Virtues and Vices of that Sex, has been handled as fully as can be deſired. Thou appeareſt to me, my dear Friend, (ſaid I, embracing him) like my better Genius, and therefore, without any farther Ceremony, ſit down, and give me an Account of the Conference.</p>
               <p>Taking a Walk (ſays he) this Morning in St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Park,</hi> with ſeveral of my Acquaintance, there was one among the reſt who was all the while, either gazing upon the Ladies as they came by, or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that Indifference to us, that made
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0104100603:157"/>
us very plainly ſee, he did not mind the Subject of our Diſcourſe, tho' we talked of all the moſt conſiderable Things that offer themſelves in ſuch Converſations. (A very ſtrange Man this, <hi>Madam,</hi> who was think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon ſome Miſtreſs, I warrant, when they were raiſing Taxes, and beating the <hi>French.</hi>) Another, who was a Perſon of excellent Senſe, and had a particular Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for this, tho' they would often diſpute about their ſeveral Thoughts of Women, in which Point they could never agree; (I wonder they ſhould diſpute about that, <hi>Madam,</hi> for the greateſt Diſputes in thoſe Caſes are, when they do agree) began to rally him upon this Subject; which he did ſo handſomely, that he pleaſed the reſt of the Company very well, without diſpleaſing his Friend in the leaſt. PHILOGYNES (which was the Name of the firſt, as MISOGYNES was of the other) (Here, <hi>Madam,</hi> I muſt confeſs, I fancied my Friend put falſe Names upon me; for beſides, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member neither of theſe Families in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the one, you muſt know, ſignifies a Woman-hater, and the other, a Woman-lover) cried to MISOGYNES, Tho' I allow you to rally me as much as you pleaſe, and am glad of any Occaſion I can give you, to exerciſe a Talent you poſſeſs in ſo eminent a Degree, yet I hope you do not in earneſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0104100603:158"/>
think the Converſation of Women ſo ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous as you would make us believe. Ten times worſe, ſaid MISOGYNES, than I can repreſent it; and ſince we have often had ſlight Skirmiſhes upon that Occaſion, and we have now Time enough to fight it out, if you have the Courage to loſe one Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's gazing at them, I challenge you to the private Walk by the Canal-ſide, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Cauſe; and theſe Gentlemen, if they pleaſe, ſhall be our Judges. Tho' I am very unwilling, anſwered PHILOGYNES, to loſe a Morning that has called out all the beſt Company of the Town, yet ſince it is in Defence of the Ladies, and you ſo boldly challenge me, I take you at your Word, upon Condition, that if I get the better in the Judgment of theſe Gentlemen, you ſhall engage to be in Love by To-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Morning. Upon Condition, that if I overcome, ſaid MISOGYNES, you will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to be out of Love by the ſame Time, I agree. That is no equal Stake, replied PHILOGYNES, for it is to lay Happineſs againſt Unhappineſs; however, I am ſo well ſatisfied of my Cauſe, that I will undertake you, even upon thoſe Odds.</p>
               <p>Upon this Agreement we walked all to the other ſide of the Park, full of Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Event of the Debate; when we were come thither, we found we had
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0104100603:159"/>
the whole Walk to ourſelves, and ſo MISO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GYNES who gave the Challenge, began in this manner:</p>
               <p>The Propagation of Mankind being the only Way to preſerve it from Extinction; and the Copulation with Women being the only Means that Nature has ordained to that End; there is no doubt but all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths ought to give any reaſonable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to it; I have therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways admir'd the Wiſdom of thoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments that incited, or compelled their Subjects to marry, as a Thing ſo much more neceſſary to Mankind in general, than pleaſing to any one in particular; but that a Man ſhould, out of a mere Act of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, run after Women; that he ſhould find Delight in their Company, is ſo very extraordinary, that the wiſe Men of old thought it hardly poſſible, otherwiſe they had had no need of making ſuch ſevere Laws to force them to it, as they did.</p>

Well, let them appear then; what do you find? Fine Coats, large Cravat-ſtrings, and good Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwigs, I muſt own, but for any Thing elſe, they, and their Perriwig Blocks are Critics alike. It is true, to do them Juſtice, they talk moſt learnedly of Points and Ribbons; have moſt mathematical Heads for the erecting of Ladies Top-knots, make as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Figures, talk as loud, and laugh more than any in Drawing-rooms and Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes; and thoſe who know nothing of their Language, would take them, by their Geſtures, to be the wittieſt Perſons in <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> but if unluckily you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, you will find it only falſe Fire, and that all this violent Laughter is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by no Jeſt. Then take them out of their own Element, begin a Diſcourſe of any Thing that is worth knowing, they are dumb; out of Modeſty? No; but they hate to talk of Things that are <hi>groſſier;</hi> and the Pedantry of Scholars, and Gravity of Men of Buſineſs, is utterly unfit for a Gentleman.</p>

Were it nothing but the Company of ſuch ſort of Creatures as theſe, it would be enough, I ſhould think, to frighten a Man of Senſe from them. Can you ſee theſe Fops, as much as you are uſed to them, without laughing? except it rather makes you bluſh to think you ſhould bring yourſelf into Competition with ſuch Tools as they are: I am far from blaming them for fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Ladies: They avoid the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Men who deſpiſe them, for that of Women who admire them: Nor do I find fault with the Ladies, for being pleaſed with them; for ſince Likeneſs, they ſay, breeds Love, what Wonder is it they are fond of thoſe Men whoſe Follies make them moſt like themſelves? but for a Man who has ſome Pretences to Wit and Learning; for one who might be acceptable to Men of Senſe, to run after them; nay, for a Man who ſpends all the Morning in the Study of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to ſpend the Afternoon among the Impertinencies of Women, puts me in mind of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank Stages in <hi>Naples,</hi> where the Jeſuits and Jackpuddings entertain the Spectators by Turns.</p>
               <p>It is poſſible, you will ſay, that all this makes for you; that the Faults of your Rivals render your Virtues the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and that there is no doubt, but
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0104100603:163"/>
a Man of Merit may ſucceed in any Place where a Man of no Merit may pretend; but, alas! Sir, you deceive yourſelf very much, if you encourage that Opinion. Had you fit Judges, there is no doubt but you were in the right: But if the faireſt Lady in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> were amongſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> where they paint the Devil of her Colour, do you expect they ſhould do her Beauty Juſtice? Or if a ſlender Man were among the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> do you think they would admire him for being well ſhaped, where they thought none but big-belly'd Men to be ſo? Credit me, Sir, a Man who leaves his Parts to the Judgment of Women, is very near the ſame Circumſtances: Will you not believe me in that Caſe, becauſe I profeſs an Enmity to them? You do well: but will you believe themſelves? View all the Town, take good Notice: Among all the young Heireſſes who run away from their Guardians, is there any one who does it with a Man of Senſe? Among all thoſe Widows who ruin themſelves by ſecond Marriages, is there any one who does it with a Man of Senſe? Among all thoſe Ladies who cuckold their Husbands, is there any one who does it with a Man of Senſe? We ſee them do theſe Things every Day, with Chaplains, Dancing-maſters, Butlers, and Footmen. Who are the Men that ſhew
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0104100603:164"/>
the tender Billets received? What are they who boaſt of the Favours of all the fineſt Women in Town? Are they not the moſt deſpicable of Mankind? Are they not ſuch whoſe Converſation is the Jeſt of Men of Senſe? And have they above one Thing about them, that diſtinguiſhes them from the other Sex?</p>
               <p>After all, Sir, are not the <hi>Women</hi> in the right in this Point? Or do they ever ſhew more Judgment, than when they pitch upon ſuch Men? What do they look for in a Husband, but one who will admire them, who will be governed by them, and upon whom all their little Tricks will paſs? And who but Fools are fit for that? What do they propoſe in a Gallant, but giving them Pleaſure without Scandal? And to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Part they have a received Notion of the Ability of Fools: Then for the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, who ſo likely to give none as thoſe Men, whom the World will hardly believe were favoured by them, tho' they took their Oaths upon it? For notwithſtanding Experience teaches us the contrary, yet People are apt to fancy, a Man of Senſe muſt ſucceed before a Coxcomb; and will rather believe the former are favoured, tho' they ſwear they are not; than the latter, tho' they ſwear they are.</p>

See here a dreadful Army, <hi>Madam,</hi> againſt us. I aſked my Friend what theſe Gentlemen had ſaid upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?

               <p>Here MISOGYNES left off, and PHYLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GYNES began to anſwer him: But I muſt beg your Pardon, Sir, ſaid my Friend, for my Time is come, and I muſt neceſſarily be gone.

a Lady a Defence of her Sex, and you will make me ſend her a Satire againſt it. Truly, my dear Friend, ſaid he, I deſigned to have told you all, but it is later than I thought, and I have Buſineſs waits for me. No Buſineſs, ſaid I, can be ſo conſiderable to you, as the ſatisfying a fair Lady is to me, therefore ſit down, and bring me fairly off what you have told me already, or you and I ſhall be Friends no longer. After all, <hi>Madam,</hi> to tell you the Truth, tho' there is no great Matter in this Speech of MISO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GYNES, yet I can hardly believe he made it upon a ſudden; 'tis poſſible tho', they two having diſcourſed the Matter as they told us before, might have provided themſelves each with Arguments. But ſuppoſing that, I can ſcarce believe one Man would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to talk ſo long without Interruption; at leaſt I am ſure, ſome who we know were none of the Company. But it is poſſible, that he who told me, might leave out all that was ſpoke by others, for Brevity ſake, being as you ſee in haſte.</p>
               <p>If you are as apt to be miſtaken in your Judgment of Things as of Looks, replied PHILOGYNES, it is no wonder you ſhould make ſuch ſtrange Concluſions. Whatever Seriouſneſs you may ſee in my Face, does not, I'll aſſure you, proceed from any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt of my Cauſe, but an Aſtoniſhment at
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0104100603:187"/>
what ſtrange Arguments the Invention of Man can ſuggeſt againſt the beſt Things that are. I ſay, the Invention of Man, for I am far from believing you in earneſt in this Point; I have too juſt an Opinion of MISOGYNES, to think he does any Thing but put on this Humour for a Trial of Skill; and I no more believe you a Hater of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for the Invective you have made againſt them, than I believe <hi>Eraſmus</hi> a Lover of Folly, for the Encomium he has writ upon it. If you have therefore any thing more to urge, forbear it not upon any ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Conviction you ſee in my Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; for, notwithſtanding that I think you have handled the Subject as fully as any one who has undertaken it, yet I will aſſure you I cannot ſubmit to your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and therefore am very ready to hear any thing you have further to urge. No, ſays MISOGYNES, I am ſenſible I have troubled the Company long enough about a Trifle, and it is very fit you ſhould have your Turn of ſpeaking now. Part of the Company was already convinced by his Arguments, the other Part thought he had ſaid as much as the Matter would bear, and therefore both agreed in deſiring PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOGYNES to ſpeak what he had to ſay, which he did in this Manner:</p>

I confeſs, Sir (ſaid he ſmiling) when I ſaw the Aſſociates you allotted me at firſt, I began to deſpair of my Cauſe; I own I was aſhamed of my Company, and reſolved to pack up Baggage inſtantly, and quit a Trade in which none but Fops and Fools were engaged; but when I ſaw the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creons,</hi> the <hi>Ovids,</hi> and all the Wits, antient and modern, in the ſame Circumſtances, I even took Heart again. Courage, ſaid I, the Buſineſs is not ſo bad as I thought, and it is poſſible his Heart may relent, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us ſome better Company than he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned us to at firſt. At leaſt, thought I, if it is a Folly to converſe with Women, it is ſome Comfort that he owns it to be a Folly of which the greateſt Wits of the World have been guilty before us: And when I ſaw all <hi>Greece,</hi> and the greater Part of <hi>Aſia</hi> venturing their Lives for <hi>One</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I thought I had ſomewhat the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of them, whilſt I ventured nothing but my Rhetoric for them <hi>All</hi> together. And when you named <hi>Samſon, Achilles, Hannibal,</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> I enquired who thoſe Gentlemen were; for certainly, thought I, if they were ſuch brave Men, and great Soldiers, as I have heard them repreſented, we have no Reaſon to deſpair of the Victory when we have them to lead us on.</p>

It is not the Cauſe of Bawds, or Courteſans that we undertake; tho' even amongſt them he repreſents a great part eaſy, loving, good-natur'd Fools, and us'd accordingly by their Lovers. But does <hi>Lucian</hi> pretend that there are no good Women? Does he fall upon the Sex in general? or does not he bring in <note n="*" place="bottom">In the Dialogue of Love.</note>
                  <hi>Charicles</hi> in one place defending them, and does not he make the greateſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium that can be of <hi>Panthaea</hi> in another, and ſpeak with abundance of Eſteem of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Women in the ſame? And if he does introduce <hi>Callicratides</hi> in one of his Dialogues railing at the Sex, in Oppoſition to <hi>Charicles,</hi> he does it in the Defence of a Sin, which I am ſure you will ſcarce think it civil to name. What ſhall we ſay to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal,</hi> but what <hi>Plato</hi> did to <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> bid him ſacrifice to the Graces. He is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways violent, always declaiming, always in a Paſſion; and what Wonder if he falls upon the Women in one of his Fits? After all, you will make no great Matter of him; for if he has writ one Satire upon the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, he has writ fifteen upon the Men. For the comic Poets and Satiriſts, whom you mention in general, when you name them in particular, I ſhall give them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Anſwers. And now truly, Sir, ſee yourſelf reduced to a miſerable Equipage;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0104100603:195"/>
ſome old Huſbands, and jilted Lovers; ſome Men with ill Faces, and worſe Miens, may poſſibly ſtick to you ſtill; but that is all: I am ſorry to ſee a Man ſo well made, of ſo much Wit, and who has been ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful amongſt the Ladies, rank himſelf with ſuch a Tribe; but you do it, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, by way of Variety only; and ſo let <hi>Miſogynes</hi> appear, at the Head of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that makes a worſe Figure than Sir <hi>John Falſtaffe</hi>'s; let them be encouraged with ſtummed Wine and muddy Ale; let them give Fire to their Mundungus, and ſo let the Battel begin, whilſt we with all the Heroes, Wits, and Philoſophers, ſee how we can defend the Cauſe we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken.</p>
               <p>I am ſenſible, Sir, that I have broken the Order of your Diſcourſe, and I beg your Pardon for it: But I thought it was neceſſary to diſtinguiſh our Enemies from our Friends, before the Armies joined, that ſo we might know whom to attack, and whom to ſpare; and having done that, I ſhall now confine myſelf to your Method, and follow the Courſe that you pleaſe to lead me.</p>
               <p>Though I perfectly agree with you in the Eſteem of the Laws made for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Marriage, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot but regret the Want of them
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0104100603:196"/>
amongſt ourſelves; yet I muſt beg your Pardon, Sir, if I wholly diſſent from you, in the Inference you would draw from it: For it is very apparent to me, and to any unbyaſſed Perſon elſe, I ſuppoſe, that thoſe Laws were never made, as you fancy, for the forcing Men to the Love of Women, to which all Countries were naturally enough enclined; but for the reſtraining them to Particulars; that whilſt they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the general Pleaſures of the Sex, they might not loſe the uſeful Part, which was the Procreation of Children. Had there been ſo few Virtues amongſt them, as you pleaſe to imagine, there had been no Need of this; When we have but one Diſh of Meat that we like, we fall upon that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Deliberation; but when the Fancy is diſtracted with Variety of Dainties, we often loſe more Time in the making our Choice, than would otherwiſe be requiſite to the ſatisfying our Appetites.</p>
               <p>It is true, Sir, it is a very good Way to judge of People by the Company they are fond of; but it is not a certain Way to judge of People by the Company that is fond of them. There was a Taylor in Love with Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but it does not neceſſarily follow that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was in Love with a Taylor. If there are ridiculous Fellows who follow the Ladies,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0104100603:197"/>
before we run down the Ladies for it, let us ſee if they do not laugh at them as well as we our ſelves. And I cannot think their purſuing them any Reaſon at all for Men of Senſe to avoid them. You would think it very hard, that <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould quit the Art of War, becauſe ſome <hi>Thraſoes</hi> and bragging Bullies pretended to it as well as they; and <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> would take it very ill, that you ſhould damn all Sorts of Poetry, becauſe of the <hi>Bavius</hi>'s and <hi>Maevius</hi>'s, who ſet up for it; and whatever Reaſon you would give againſt the being a Miniſter of State, I dare ſay, Sir <hi>Politic Woudbee</hi>'s aiming at it would be none. (Here <hi>Philogynes</hi> ſeems to me not to underſtand the right Uſe of that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Part of Mankind call'd Fools; For it is only the Half-Wit that is intolerable, and a true Fool, is next a true Wit the beſt Company in the World; for as a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Author has extreamly well obſerved,<q>

After this I need not tell you, Sir, that it is very ill judging of People by their Out-ſide; and as I laugh at thoſe who like a Man only for his being well dreſſed, ſo I fancy you will allow them to be as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, who run him down only for the ſame Reaſon.

               <p>(Courage! there are two good Precedents for the Beaux.)</p>
               <p>After all, Sir, I know there are a great many of theſe gay Coxcombs, of theſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pretenders to Love; and I have nothing to ſay in their Behalf; let them even ſhift for themſelves amongſt the <hi>Thraſoes,</hi> and <hi>Bavius</hi>'s. But they do not only pretend (you ſay) they are ſucceſsful too. It is very poſſible, Sir; I do not know but there may
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0104100603:199"/>
be Fools enough of the other Sex, to like the Fools of ours. But it is with the beſt Sort of Women too (you ſay) that they ſucceed. And who tells you ſo, pray? They themſelves. I ſwear, Sir, though I have a very great Eſteem for thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, yet I muſt beg their Pardon for my Faith in this Point; I can never think a Woman, whoſe Wit we all allow, can be fond of a Man whoſe Folly we all ſee. On the other ſide, I know how natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral it is, for every one to avoid Contempt; and when a Man is deſpiſed in one Place, what ſo reaſonable as to make you believe he is eſteemed in another. And I hope the Gentlemen themſelves will take it for a Compliment, when I tell them I do not believe a Word they ſay in this Point; ſince certainly a Man of Honour would rather of the two, tell a Lye to the Prejudice of a Woman who uſes him ill, than a Truth to the utter Ruin of one who grants him all the Favours he can aſk.</p>
               <p>But let us judge them by their Actions, ſay you! Do not moſt of the young Heireſſes run away with the pitiful Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? If they do, Sir, it ſhould rather deſerve your Pity than your Anger; or if you muſt be angry, be angry with the Guardians whoſe Severity frighten them away, and yet hinders them the Sight of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0104100603:200"/>
any Men of Merit to run away with. It is no Wonder that one who has never ſeen any Town, but where he was born, ſhould think that the fineſt in the World; and you cannot blame a Woman for being in Love with a Man who does not deſerve her, if ſhe never ſaw any who did. All that we can reaſonably expect in that Point is, that ſhe ſhould make ſome Satisfaction when ſhe ſees the World better; and if ſhe ſhews her Contempt of her Choice then, it is as much (if not more) than can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. In like manner you cannot ſay a Widow makes an ill choice, except you prove ſhe was offered a better. If a Man, who is obliged to ride a Journey, does it upon an ill Horſe, you will be very well ſatisfy'd certainly, when he tells you, it is the beſt he could get. (I confeſs, Madam, this ſeems to me but a very indifferent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for the Widows; for he would make us believe, it is but next Oars with them; and ſo I told my Friend; but he reply'd, I muſt conſider, it is only thoſe Widows who make an ill Choice, about which he is to ſpeak; and as he cannot ſay of them, as of the young Maids, that it was for want of ſeeing the World; ſo they muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with this Excuſe, or make a better for themſelves.) For the Wives, who you ſay cuckold their Huſbands, there may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0104100603:201"/>
more to be ſaid. Modeſty being almoſt an inſeparable Quality of Wit, there is no Wonder that a Man who is poſſeſſed of that, ſhould ſo ſeldom ſucceed in theſe Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; whilſt Fools, by their natural Impudence puſh on the Thing; and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Women are a ſort of Forts that are ſooner taken by Storm than Treaty. So that this ſhews rather the great Confidence of the Man, than the little Judgment of the Woman; who it is forty to one had much rather a Man of Senſe was poſſeſſed of her, if he would take the ſame Methods to gain her as the other had done.</p>
               <p>(After all, Madam, I think none of theſe Excuſes extraordinary; therefore if I were worthy to adviſe the Ladies, they ſhould rather make Uſe of Men of Wit in all theſe Capacities, than put their Friends to the Trouble of inventing ſuch pitiful Defences for them.)</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, as I cannot ſee any Reaſon why Women ſhould naturally love Fools more than Men of Wit, ſo I ſhall very hardly be brought to believe they do. In a Huſband I ſuppoſe they propoſe a Man whoſe Converſation ſhall be agreeable as well as his Perſon; and who ſhall have Wit to entertain them, as well as Wiſdom to direct them; and in whom can this be found, but in Men of the beſt Senſe? If in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0104100603:202"/>
a Gallant, as you ſay, they propoſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure without Scandal, tis very hard the Heat that warms a Man's Brain, ſhould ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſettle there, as to render him inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of pleaſing them otherwiſe; though it is poſſible, by reaſon of his having Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Thoughts to divert him, he may not give himſelf ſo entirely up to thoſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as People leſs capable of thinking do: And for the Scandal, who ſo proper to hinder that, as thoſe who have Prudence to manage Things ſo as not to be found out, and Wit enough to turn it off if they are? Whilſt a Fool by his Want of Senſe ſhall quickly make the Thing public, if there be an Intrigue, or by his Vanity brag of one, though there be none. Add to this, that when a Woman ſeems pleaſed with a Man of Wit, every body is apt to attribute it to the Pleaſure of his Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereas, when ſhe is fond of a Man, in whom we can ſee nothing to be liked, we naturally ſuppoſe ſhe likes him for ſomething that we do not ſee: And though it is poſſible it may be only Want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Lady, yet the World is apt to compliment her Underſtanding in that Caſe, to the Prejudice of her Reputation. And to conclude, Sir, though I do not believe all thoſe Men ſucceſsful who ſay they are not, yet I am very much inclined to believe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0104100603:203"/>
all thoſe Men not to be ſucceſsful, who ſay they are.</p>
               <p>For your Examples of Women-haters, I have ſufficiently I think reply'd to them already; and for your other Arguments, if it be an Affront to call a Man effeminate, I hope you do not think it any great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to tell a Woman ſhe is maſculine; and had that Argument been urged againſt you, I dare anſwer for you, you would have ſaid, that that only proved the Perfections of the Sexes different; and as Man was made for the ruder Labours, it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite he ſhould be ſtrong and coarſe; and the Women, being made for the eaſier Things, ought to be ſoft, tender, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate: And as for Mens being governed by their Wives, though the being hector'd by them is not ſo commendable; yet it <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>I have as great a Veneration for thoſe Poets you mention, as any Man can; and upon that Account I ſhall not believe all the Ill they ſay of their Miſtreſſes, becauſe I ſuppoſe they would not have me: As I have been a Lover myſelf, ſo I know very well that People are apt in thoſe Caſes to take Suſpicions for Realities, and Surmiſes for Matter of Fact.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0104100603:205"/>
and would not any one who came in when he was in one of his Rants, conclude, a Man who loved ſo well, would not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged againſt a Miſtreſs at that rate, unleſs her Falſhood was very apparent? And yet when we come to examine the Cauſe of this Diſorder, what is it, but <hi>Morats</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him his Life at her Requeſt, or his leaning upon her Lap when he died. I rather mention this than any of the Poets you ſpoke of, not only becauſe all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Paſſions of a Lover are deſcribed with as much Art and Delicacy, as in any of thoſe Antients, but alſo, that ſeeing the whole Buſineſs before you, you may judge of every little Cauſe of his Diſorder, as well as he himſelf, which in Odes and Elegies you cannot do. You ſee the Lover there in a Fury, but what Cauſe he has to be ſo, there is no body to tell you, but he who is in it. Add to this, that a Man often feigns Jealouſy of his Miſtreſs, to binder her from being ſo of him, and will upbraid her Falſhood to defend his own. (That is a Thing, now I confeſs, Madam, which I can hardly believe.) And it is evident, they had not really any ſuch bad Opinion of Women, ſince with all this they did not ceaſe to run after them. However, if you think theſe general Anſwers not ſufficient, let us ſee what we can ſay to Particulars.

For the Complaints of Cruelty and Scorn. I look upon them as Things of Courſe; and therefore, ſhall ſay nothing to them.

               <p>Now if Ruin and Deſolation has come to great Men, and States, from Women, it ſhewed they had a good Opinion of the Sex in general, that they would ſuffer for them; and had they not been ſenſible the greateſt Part were good, they could never have been impoſed upon by the Bad. Then as for thoſe ill Women whom you have

The Diſpute is not whether there have been any ill Women in the World, but whether there are not more Good.

If the <hi>Capuan</hi> Women deſtroyed <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Army, they deſtroyed a Body of Enemies that all the Men in <hi>Italy</hi> could not. In like manner, for your other Inſtances we might tell you, that <hi>Procopius,</hi> who tells thoſe terrible Stories of <hi>Theodora, Anecdota,</hi> is ſo very paſſionate all along, and mixes ſuch ridiculous Fables with what he tells, that there is no great Credit to be given to him. (This <hi>Procopius</hi> was a Soldier un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> and has writ, amongſt other Things, a ſecret Hiſtory of thoſe Times: In this he repreſents the Empreſs <hi>Theodora</hi>

more like a Devil than a Woman; he makes her and the Emperor converſe frequently with Spirits, and makes her put them to an Employment, that ſavours more of the Fleſh than the Spirit.) Though granting ſhe was as lewd as he repreſents her, what Wonder is it, that one who had been a ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Play-wench, and common Strumpet before the Emperor married her, ſhould not turn Saint after?

more celebrated in <hi>Italy,</hi> both for her Learning and Piety, by the Account that <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> has given them of her, than it is here at home.

But I can hardly omit two Ladies who are Strangers, and however I am ſtraitned for Room, yet methinks I ought to be juſt to thoſe who were civil to me; ſince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I received particular Favours from the Procurator <hi>Cornara,</hi> during my Stay at <hi>Venice,</hi> let me not paſs over in ſilence his Daughter, for whom moſt of the greateſt Princes, and Learned Men of <hi>Europe</hi> have teſtified ſuch an Eſteem.

Her Siſter, whom I had the Honour to ſee (ſhe herſelf being dead ſome Time before) is likewiſe a Perſon of very ſingular Endowments; and all this whilſt they are one of the beſt Families of a Town, where
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0104100603:219"/>
the Nobility ſeem almoſt as proud of their Ignorance, as their Liberty. The other I ſhall mention, is <hi>Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> a Princeſs whoſe Accompliſhments are ſo generally known, that it is enough to have named her; a Lady of that true Judgment, that ſhe knew how to eſteem Wit and Learning at the ſame Time that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed Crowns; and ſeemed to be born as a ſufficient Recompence to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Letters, for all the Miſchiefs her Predeceſſors the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> had done it before; I am ſatisfied it is impoſſible for me to add any Thing to a Glory ſo eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed as that of this Princeſs is; yet as I never paſſed any Time either with greater Benefit, or greater Satisfaction, than what I paſſed in her Converſation, ſo I am very well pleaſed, methinks, with any thing that gives me Occaſion to call it to my Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. There might be as advantageous Characters, perhaps, given of ſome Ladies of our own Country now living, did not their Modeſty, that inſeparable Quality of Wit and Women, deter me from it.</p>
               <p>We might tell you farther, Sir, that this Modeſty too often hinders them from make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Virtues known: That they are not of thoſe eternal Scriblers who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually plagueing the World with their Works; and that it is not the Vanity of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0104100603:220"/>
getting a Name, which ſeveral of the greateſt Men of the World have owned to be the Cauſe of their writing, that is the Cauſe of the Womens. Had not <hi>Sapho</hi> been ſo much in Love, it is poſſible we had never heard any Mention of one of the greateſt Wits that ever was born; had not <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Quintilian</hi> given us Accounts of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia,</hi> and the Daughters of <hi>Laelius,</hi> and <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> they had never done it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; had not <hi>Jane Gray</hi> been put to Death, her Virtues had never been ſo much taken notice of; had not the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Nun been deſerted by her Gallant, we had miſſed ſome of the moſt paſſionate Letters that theſe latter Ages have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; and had not <hi>Anna Maria Schur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Works been publiſhed by a Friend, without her Conſent, we had loſt the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of them. We may tell you too, that it is not only in reſpect of their own Sex that they are admired, but even of ours. That of thoſe two Odes we have yet of <hi>Sapho,</hi> we owe one to <hi>Dionyſius Halicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſaeus,</hi> the other to <hi>Longin,</hi> the two beſt Critics of <hi>Greece,</hi> who choſe them out for Examples to their Rules, before any of the Mens: That the Epiſtle of <hi>Sapho</hi> to <hi>Phaon,</hi> which is eſteemed the moſt delicate of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s, is ſuppoſed to be taken out of her Writings: That <hi>Corinna</hi> was five Times
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0104100603:221"/>
victorious over <hi>Pindar,</hi> the beſt Lyric Poet of our Sex. And were we here in <hi>England</hi> as forward in printing Letters, as they are in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> we might furniſh Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of them written by our own Ladies, that would make all the Women-haters bluſh, or make all Men elſe bluſh for them.</p>
               <p>(Here, <hi>Madam,</hi> I muſt own to you I grew jealous, for I could not imagine that PHILOGYNES would have ſaid this, without having ſeen ſome of your Ladyſhip's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.)</p>
               <p>We may tell you too, that granting the equal Capacities of both Sexes, it is a greater Wonder to find one Learned Woman, than a hundred Learned Men, conſidering the Difference of their Educations. If you ſhould go into <hi>Greece,</hi> and, ſeeing the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is among them at preſent, tell them their Countrymen were incapable of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would you not be very well ſatisfied, when they told you of the <hi>Platos</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotles</hi> of Antiquity? And that if they had not as famous Men now, it was becauſe they have not the ſame Advantages they had then? And pray why may not the Women be allowed the ſame Excuſe? Will you by your Laws and Cuſtoms en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep them ignorant, and then blame them for being ſo? And forbid all
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0104100603:222"/>
Men of Senſe keeping them Company, as you do, and yet be angry with them for keeping Company with Fools? Conſider what Time and Charge is ſpent to make Men fit for ſomewhat; Eight or Nine Years at School; Six or Seven Years at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity; Four or Five Years in Travel; and after all this, are they not almoſt all Fops, Clowns, Dunces, or Pedants? I know not what you think of the Women; but if they are Fools, they are Fools, I am ſure, with leſs Pains, and leſs Expence than we are.</p>
               <p>Upon ſecond Thoughts I hope, Sir, you will allow, that Women may have Wit and Learning; for their Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct we may poſſibly ſay more anon. But for Heaven's ſake, do not aggravate their Faults always at that Rate; for whatever <hi>Sapho</hi>'s Life and Converſation were, there is nothing in her Writings, but what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the moſt tender, and delicate Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the World: And as for <hi>Aloiſia Sigaea,</hi> (I give you Thanks for putting me in mind of <note n="*" place="bottom">

Should I but give you a Liſt of the Martyrs of that Sex, from thoſe who ſuffered under <hi>Tiberius,</hi> to thoſe who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered under our own Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> I fancy I ſhould make you aſhamed of your <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides,</hi> your <hi>Juvenal,</hi> and all your Satiriſts
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0104100603:238"/>
put together. Should I after this defend them in the Virtue to which they are thought to have leaſt Pretences, which is, Courage; ſhould I but name thoſe who have been famous for their warlike Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſhould I tell you of <hi>Deborah, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſilaea, Thaleſtris, Camilla;</hi> ſhould I ſhew you a Country <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Acoſta</hi>'s Hiſtory of the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
                  </note> of <hi>Amazons,</hi> even in our own Time: Should I carry you into <hi>France,</hi> and ſhew you a warlike Virgin (at leaſt an unmarried Woman) whoſe Memory is ſtill annually celebrated by one of their chiefeſt <note n="†" place="bottom">Orleans.</note> Towns, and who, beſides her Fame in their Chronicles, has given a Subject to one of the moſt famous <note n="‡" place="bottom">La Pucelle <hi>de Monſieur</hi> Chapelaine.</note> Heroic Poems which that Nation has produced; would you not, after all, confeſs they might very eaſily be defended, even in this Point too? But I ſhall wave that; I am ſatisfied with the Care univerſal Cuſtom has taken of them; and as Seamen in a Storm, to preſerve their Things of greateſt Value, throw away thoſe of leſs; ſo I am very well pleaſed that Mankind ſhould be expoſed to the Hazards of War, whilſt the Fair Sex is preſerved in Safety at Home, whoſe Smiles are the nobleſt Reward a brave Man can

deſire for all the Hazards and Fatigues he has endured in a Campagne.</p>
               <p>But it is generally agreed that all Virtues are requiſite for thoſe who govern well; and ſince there are ſome Countries where Women are excluded from the Throne, and no Country where they are not poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned, it would be convenient, methinks, to ſee what they do, when by Accident they are placed upon it. I ſhall not trouble you here with <hi>Deborah,</hi> nor <hi>Eſther,</hi> nor as much as mention <hi>Semiramis,</hi> though you have mentioned her upon another Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and yet certainly the Bravery of moſt of her Actions ought to make us forget the Faults of ſome few; but I ſhall confine myſelf within the Bounds of our own Country.</p>

                  </note>At a Time when the <hi>Britons</hi> groaned under the Servitude of the <hi>Romans;</hi> when the King, by thinking to oblige the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, gave him an Opportunity of pillag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Country; and that their Patience under their Sufferings, was only a Means of making them more; When their Houſes were robbed, their Wives and Daughters raviſhed, and their Sons taken away from them; then <hi>Boadicea</hi> aroſe, and by her Courage, as well as Eloquence, inſpired

her diſpirited Countrymen with a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of throwing off that Yoke which was grown intolerable to be born. It is true, indeed, the End was not anſwerable to the Succeſſes of the Beginning; nor to the Glory ſo heroic an Undertaking deſerved; however as it was neither Want of Courage nor Conduct in her, ſo we ought to render her that Veneration which is due to ſo reſolute an Enterprize.</p>
               <p>But as one of the greateſt Attempts the <hi>Britons</hi> made for their Liberty was whilſt they were led by a Woman, ſo we muſt own the greateſt Glory our Nation could ever boaſt, was under the Government of one of the ſame Sex. It was in the Time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> that this Iſland arrived at that Pitch of Greatneſs, to which it had been aſcending for ſeveral Ages, and from which it has been declining, till very lately, ever ſince: It is the Name of this Princeſs that is dearer to all <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> than the Names of all the Monarchs ſince the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt beſides, and the only one whoſe Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day has been celebrated after her Death, by the voluntary Gratitude of the People.</p>
               <p>But however we may forget Things that are paſt, let us not overſee that which lies before our Eyes; and ſince the Occaſion is ſo very fair, I know not how we can omit the ſhewing our Senſe of thoſe Virtues, of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0104100603:241"/>
which the whole Nation has demonſtrated ſo grateful an Acknowledgment by the Body of their Repreſentatives; and never were they more truly their Repreſentatives before. Yes, Sir, without going to foreign Countries, without ſearching the Hiſtories of our own, we have even in our own Time, and our own Country, a Princeſs who has governed to their general Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, a People the moſt curious to pry into the Faults of their Governors, of any People under the Sun. A Princeſs, who though ſhe never ſhewed any Fondneſs of Vain-glory, or Authority, yet when the Neceſſity of the Kingdom called her to the Helm, managed Affairs with that Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which is very rarely found in thoſe who are the moſt ambitious of Command. Every Thing during that little Time of her Government, was ordered with that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Conduct, and Prudence, that her greateſt Friends cannot find Eloquence enough to commend, nor her greateſt Enemies the leaſt Pretences to condemn. Though ſhe had a Husband venturing his Life in another Country, with a Bravery equal to what has made us ſuſpect the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Antiquity; tho' our Fleet, the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks of the Nation, was managed in a Manner the Courage of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seamen was utterly unacquainted with; tho' a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0104100603:242"/>
Monarch, who thinks himſelf able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with all <hi>Europe</hi> together, ſeemed to make his utmoſt Efforts againſt a Princeſs, who had nothing but the univerſal Hearts of her Subjects to defend her; tho' all Chriſtendom was in Suſpence to ſee the Event of the Undertaking, and every little Prince had forgot his own Danger to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template hers; even at this Time did we ſee her look with all the Unconcern ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, and whilſt every Body elſe was alarmed for her Safety, ſhe only ſeemed to have known nothing of the Danger. Not that this Unconcern proceeded from any Ignorance of her Condition, or unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Contempt of her Adverſary; no, ſhe provided againſt their Attempts with all the Prudence could be wiſhed for, at the ſame Time that ſhe looked upon the Danger with all the Courage in Nature.</p>
               <p>But however great theſe Virtues may appear, when they are ſet off by the Luſtre of a public Command, yet they are in Effect much greater, when they teach Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to deſpiſe all ſuch dazling Trifles. Here it is, Sir, that we have a freſh Field for Eloquence, when we ſee a Lady diſſatisfied at that Glory which ſhe had to every Bodies Satisfaction beſide, and grudge herſelf that Authority, which ſhe owed to the Abſence of a Husband whom ſhe loved ſo much
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0104100603:243"/>
better than that. What think you, Sir, of that Alacrity, of that Joy with which ſhe reſigned up the Government? Does it not put you in mind of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, who quitted their Plough to command an Army, and when the Victory was gain'd, returned with greater Content to their Plough again? This is that Wiſdom which we ſhould admire; this is that Virtue which we ſhould adore; and we ought to deſpiſe all thoſe little Pretenders to Buſineſs, who thruſt themſelves into the Management of Affairs againſt every Bodies Will but their own; and having neither Virtue nor Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough to retire from it at the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Murmurs of the People, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally made Sacrifices at laſt to the juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of an enraged Nation.</p>
               <p>Theſe are thoſe blazing Comets, whoſe fatal Glories portend Deſtruction to a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, whilſt the Virtues of the others, like thoſe of the Sun, give it Life and Heat, by their benign Influence. Much more, Sir, might be ſaid in <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Sex,</hi> which I ſhall purpoſely omit, becauſe I am ſatisfied I can never conclude with a more illuſtrious Example.</p>

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0104100603:251"/>
indeed, bragg'd to me of the Happineſs of a marry'd Life. I thought the beſt Way to find out this Happineſs, was in going to his Lady, who has fully convinced me of all her Husband ſaid. But as I have a perfect Friendſhip for the Gentleman, I muſt confeſs, Sir, I am as well ſatisfied with his having a fine <hi>Wife,</hi> as if I had <hi>one</hi> myſelf.</p>

               <speaker>HUSBAND.</speaker>
               <p>I confeſs, Sir, I have nothing to ſay in Contradiction to theſe Gentlemen. All that the one ſays, and the other would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, may be true for aught I know; nor do I think it much worth my While to enquire after it. Half the Town, the firſt ſays, laugh at me for being a <hi>Cuckold;</hi> and he would have me make it public, that the other Half might laugh at me too. But pray let us conſider how much wiſer he acts: He marry'd a <hi>Wife,</hi> who by the way is not extreamly taking; and yet you cannot imagine what Care, what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, what cunning Stratagems, this wiſe Perſon made Uſe of to ſearch out a Thing, which, after all, he did not care to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0104100603:252"/>

He does not pretend that Poetry makes People happy in this World, becauſe we very plainly ſee the contrary; but he pleaſes himſelf with a vain Reverſion of imaginary Honours that he is never to enjoy till he himſelf is inſenſible of them. It will be a very great Satisfaction, doubtleſs, to a Man when he is in the Grave, to think his Verſes run as ſmoothly as ever; and one muſt be an Infidel to doubt but that the Author of a fine Poem will be extreamly conſidered in the other World.</p>

my Particular, and ſpeak to the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a <hi>Stateſman</hi> in general. Is there then any Thing ſo ridiculous as for a Man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the making himſelf Great, as the End of all his Actions? The only End a Wiſe Man propoſes, is the making himſelf happy; how ridiculous then muſt he appear, who makes himſelf miſerable, in order to make himſelf Great? Who ſeeks the Contempt of the Wiſe, that he may get the Admiration of Fools? Who leads a falſe diſſembling Life; fawning upon thoſe who treat him inſolently, and treating thoſe inſolently who fawn upon him? Who values himſelf upon the bearing other Peoples Burdens, for which the only Thanks he gets, is Envy, or Contempt: Envy if he ſucceed, and Contempt if he fail? Should a Man, who came late to an Inn, inſtead of taking the Reſt that was requiſite to refreſh him for the next Day's Journey, enter into Cabals, form Deſigns, and manage Intrigues to get the beſt Room in the Houſe, which would make him very uneaſy if he fail'd of it; and from which, tho' he ſucceeded, he muſt neceſſarily depart the next Morning; would not this Man appear ridiculouſly fooliſh, and contemptible to all the World? And when we ſee a Man in a World from which he muſt neceſſarily depart in a very ſhort Space of Time, inſtead of preparing
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0104100603:263"/>
himſelf for what is to follow, waſte all that little Time in ſenſeleſs Cabals, in vain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and in ridiculous Intrigues, to make himſelf Great and Powerful; which, if he do not attain it, makes him uneaſy; and which, if he do, he muſt leave immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly again: Is not this Man ten Times more ridiculous, and more fooliſh than the other? The Man who by his Folly loſes his Reſt one Night, will without doubt grow wiſer, and take a double Share of Reſt the next: But, alas! in the other Caſe, it is quite different; there is no ſecond Opportunity of correcting the firſt; and he who has ſpent <hi>one</hi> Life fooliſhly, will never be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>another</hi> to employ better.</p>

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0104100603:264"/>
of the World, to pronounce all Men Mad beſide. 'Tis true, their Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance does not appear, perhaps, to the Vulgar; but as in a Mad-houſe, one of the Patients does not perceive <hi>that</hi> Madneſs in his Companion, which is preſently found out by a ſober Stander-by: So in this <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi> Madneſs which poſſeſſes the World in general, tho' they do not diſcover it in one another, yet it is at firſt Sight apparent to the Eyes of the Sage. Do you ask me then, who is this Wiſe Man that I have mentioned? It is he who places not his Felicity in his Beauty, his Wealth, or his Learning; who deſires no Pleaſure, who fears no Pain: Whom the Frowns of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune cannot deject, nor her Smiles exalt: Who is happy in Priſons, in Baniſhments, in Torments: Who, if he were broiling in <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s BULL, would cry out, <hi>How plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant is this!</hi> It matters not how many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows Fortune aims at him, ſince he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable to them all. As there are ſome Stones ſo hard, that the Iron cannot touch; as Diamonds can neither be cut nor broken, but reſiſt the ſtrongeſt Force; as Rocks in the Sea break the Fury of the Waves, and, beaten upon ſo many Ages, retain no Marks of its Rage; ſo is the Soul of a Wiſe Man, ſolid and firm; and has collected ſo much Strength, that it remains as ſafe from all
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0104100603:265"/>
Injuries, as any of the Things I mentioned. But what will you ſay; is there no one then who will attempt the injuring a Wiſe Man? Yes, they will attempt it, but they cannot perform it: He is elevated ſo much above the Vulgar, that none of their ill Deſigns can arrive at him. When that fooliſh King darkened the Day with his Arrows, there was not one of them which reached the Sun; when the Chains were caſt into the Sea, they could not bind the Waves; and thoſe who deſtroy the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, do no Injury to the Divinity: In like Manner, whatever is done proudly, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, or inſolently, againſt a Wiſe Man, (who is in nothing different from a God, but in Point of Time) is but attempted in vain.</p>

This mighty Man, who would laugh in <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s BULL, yet is liable to Pain and Anguiſh, as well as the meaneſt of the People; the moſt vulgar Weapon ſhall hurt him; and the moſt ordinary Strength ſhall reach him.

                  <hi>Mercury,</hi> thou art a ſwift Meſſenger, haſte away to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> inform him of what we have done, and know his further Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Matter: You may tell him, that upon a full Survey of Mankind it appears, that every one has ſuch a <hi>ſufficient Share of Folly,</hi> that he has no Reaſon at all to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of his Neighbours having more. That in Anſwer to thoſe who think their Folly obſtructs their Happineſs, it is very plain, that the Happineſs of Mankind is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with this Folly, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to cure them of the one, without endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering the other too. Should we convince the <hi>Fool</hi> who ſquanders away his Money, that he might live to want it; ſhould we convince the <hi>Fool</hi> who heaps up Treaſure, that in a little Time he muſt die, and have
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0104100603:269"/>
all his Treaſure taken from him; ſhould we convince the <hi>Husband,</hi> who places his Happineſs in his Wife and Children, that the one cuckolds him, and the other are none of his; ſhould we convince the <hi>Man</hi> who does Things to be eternally famous, that after Death he will have no Senſe of Fame, or of whatever is ſaid of him; we ſhould make them all miſerable and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. On the other Side, by taking away their Folly, we ſhou'd take away one of the moſt uſeful Qualities in the World, ſince it is very evident, that Mankind live upon the Follies of one another. Were there not <hi>Fools</hi> who ſell Eſtates, what would become of the <hi>Fools</hi> who buy them? Were there not <hi>Fools</hi> who marry, human Kind would come to an End. Were there not <hi>Fools</hi> of Buſineſs, how would the <hi>Fools</hi> that meddle with no Buſineſs be managed? Were there not fighting <hi>Fools,</hi> who would protect the <hi>Fools,</hi> that would not fight, from Oppreſſion? And were there not <hi>Writing Fools,</hi> what would the <hi>Reading Fools</hi> do for a Diverſion? So that upon the whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I think we had even as good leave the World as we find it. However, if he thinks there ought to be ſomewhat done in this Matter, after having made ſo much Noiſe about it; the moſt general Folly in Men being that of ſhewing Severity to other
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0104100603:270"/>
Peoples Faults, while they neglect thoſe they commit themſelves; He may order a ſolemn <hi>Proclamation</hi> to be made, <hi>That no Man ſhall have the Privilege of cenſuring the Follies of other People, till he can bring a Certificate, under the Hands of three judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Neighbours, that he has none at all of his own.</hi>

               <p>THOUGH I receiv'd your generous Preſent two Days after the Date, yet the Affairs of my Parents, and the Commands of a noble Lady,<note n="*" place="bottom">Lady <hi>Delawar.</hi>
                  </note> have harraſs'd me ſo much, that I could not get Time to return my Thanks ſooner. I doubt you'll quickly be convinc'd you have formed a very unjuſt Idea of me; for I proteſt, on a Self-Examination, I can't find one of thoſe good Qualities you lay to my Charge. However, 'tis highly obliging in you, to fancy me ingenious and agreeable, 'till you know the contrary; as ſuch, I accept the Compliment, and acknowledge your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Candor. The Queſtion now is, Whether I ought not to ſtop here, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your favourable Opinion by my Silence, rather than hazard it by a farther Diſcovery of my Ignorance? The firſt is certainly moſt prudent, but the latter, being more juſt, I think it a Point of Honour to undeceive you, and diſpel the falſe Charms of an imaginary Proſpect. Your <hi>American</hi> Simile
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0104100603:279"/>
would have been proper enough for me, but I can by no Means allow you to make Uſe on't, neither can I admit of a Barter ſo exceedingly diſadvantageous to my Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent. No, Sir, I'll preſerve your finiſh'd Poems as a Standard of good Verſe, but I ſhall not pretend to traffic with you, becauſe I never wrote any Thing that pleas'd myſelf; and ſurely if an Author can't ſatisfy her own Judgment, 'tis in vain to expect ſhe ſhould pleaſe others.</p>
               <p>I hope you'll be contented with this Anſwer, becauſe 'tis Truth; and I hope alſo, that if I ſhould not ſend ſo quick a Return to your Letters, as you may expect, or as they deſerve, you will not preſently accuſe me of Diſreſpect; for, what with the continued Weakneſs of my Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, and the neceſſary Concerns of Life, I have ſo little Time at my own Diſpoſal, that I dare not promiſe a conſtant Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, leſt I ſhould engage for more than I can perform. I conjure you, by your moſt beloved Muſe, never more to call any Thing of mine <hi>excellent,</hi> ſince, in my Opinion, <hi>unmerited Praiſe</hi> is no better than <hi>civil Lampoon.</hi> I ſhould pity your hard Fate in living among ſuch <hi>unſociable Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi> did I not believe that a <hi>wiſe Man</hi> ſcorns to be beholden to <hi>Fortune</hi> for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious Happineſs; and that you are this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0104100603:280"/>
Philoſopher, I no more doubt, than that you imitate the <hi>Elder</hi> SCIPIO, and improve your <hi>Lucky Idleneſs.</hi> However, ſince you ſeem too Modeſt to own the Happineſs you find in <hi>Solitude,</hi> and again think fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to Complaint, I will alſo confeſs, that I join in your juſt Reſentments, (for I have had the ſame Account of the ill-natur'd <hi>Wintonians</hi> by another Hand) and am now ſenſible, that what I took for a <hi>Satire,</hi> was no more than a <hi>Character</hi> well <hi>drawn.</hi> But is it poſſible the Inhabitants ſhould be all of a Piece? Is there no ſhining Exception, no generous Mind who has Fortitude enough to reſiſt the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Particles of its native Air? Yes, yes, you will confeſs, I know you will, that Mrs. <hi>Martland</hi> has Learning, Virtue, Wit, and good Humour, ſufficient to atone for the Vices, Folly, and Ill-nature of a much larger City than <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> How then can you complain of <hi>Solitude?</hi> or how can you call that Place dull, where our <hi>Engliſh</hi> SAPHO reſides? SAPHO was the Name Mr. CROMWELL choſe for her, and not unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly, her excellent Verſes requiring a nobler Epithet, if the Records of Time had afforded it. I know not whether you have the good Fortune to be acquainted with this incomparable Lady; if you are, and find a convenient Opportunity, I would

intreat you to give her my beſt Reſpects, and to aſſure her that I have been many Years very ambitious of ſubſcribing myſelf her unfeign'd Admirer.

               <p>INſtead of convincing me that I have form'd a very unjuſt Idea of you, your laſt Letter has but the more confirm'd my Opinion of your Worth and Goodneſs: and tho' an Unwillingneſs of owning the ſhining Qualifications of your Mind, and the diſtinguiſhing Character of true Merit, has conjur'd me never to uſe the Word <hi>excellent</hi> for any thing of <hi>yours,</hi> yet I muſt and will ſay, that I never ſaw any of your Writings, but what deſerv'd that <hi>Title;</hi> neither can I admit of your excuſive Arguments for ſolid Reaſons, why you ſhould deny me the Advantage and Satisfaction of a <hi>Poetical Merchandiſe,</hi> but only take them to be a modeſt Refuſal of my Offer, upon the Account of my Inſufficiency to become your Correſpondent in ſo precious a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity as <hi>Verſe.</hi> Tho' I have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſlow in anſwering your Letter, yet do not accuſe me of Diſreſpect or Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, ſince it is not deſign'd as a premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Silence, for indeed I have been ſeiz'd with ſo ſevere a Fit of Melancholy, that for the Space of ten Days I have not had
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0104100603:283"/>
the Heart to apply my Mind to any thing but the unſociable Companions of an uneaſy Being, Sorrow and Diſcontent; and how long it would have continu'd upon me, had not the prevailing Thoughts of Fair CORINNA rous'd me from that Lethargy of Temper, I cannot well determine. Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and Inſipidneſs are the Epidemical Diſtempers of our Town; therefore it is no Wonder that my Spirits, naturally prone to Dullneſs, ſhould ſo ſoon catch the reigning Contagion. LUCIUS FLORUS, in his <hi>Hiſtory of the Second</hi> PUNIC WAR, gives us an Account, how HANNIBAL in his Nonage was ſworn ROME's <hi>eternal Foe:</hi> In like manner, do I verily believe, that the <hi>Wintonians,</hi> in their Infancy, fretfully reſolv'd to be everlaſting Enemies to Mirth and Senſe; for at the leaſt Appearance of either, they ſtart like wild Beaſts at Fire-Arms, and raiſe all their Poſſe of Malice and Ill-nature to ſuppreſs whatever bears the Face of Wit or Diverſion. Tho' I am a Stranger, Madam, to Mrs. <hi>Martland</hi>'s Perfections, yet ſince you are pleaſed to beſtow ſo high an Elogy on her Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Virtue, Wit, and Good-humour, I believe her to be an extraordinary Lady, and on your Commendation, am very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of her Acquaintance, but how to introduce myſelf to her is the Point; for

you muſt know, that our <hi>Ladies</hi> here, like <hi>Snails,</hi> keep every one in their own <hi>Shell,</hi> and are wond'rous ſhy of Men Viſitants. How far a Perſon of ſuch fine Notions, and ſuch an exalted Mind as the <hi>Elder</hi> SCIPIO was, might improve the Minutes of a ſolitary Retirement, I am not able to judge; but ſure I am, that one of my ſlender Underſtanding, deſtitute of Books, and ingenious Converſation, can reap no other Advantage from a Country Life, than what DOMITIAN <hi>did from killing of Flies,</hi> paſſing away time in an idle Employment: Whatever Pleaſures that renowned <hi>Hero</hi> found in Solitude, were certainly owing to his Choice; but my Retirement is only the Reſult of invincible Neceſſity, which gives a Tincture of Bitterneſs and Diſguſt to all the Pleaſures of a rural Life.

               <head>Lady CHUDLEIGH, TO Mrs. THOMAS. 1720.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>YOUR various Styles of <hi>Croſs</hi> and <hi>Kind,</hi>
                  </l>

                  <l>
                     <hi>How Farmers,</hi> politickly, vein</l>
                  <l>Their <hi>Bacon-Hogs</hi> with Fat and Lean:</l>
                  <l>They feaſt them one Day, next they faſt,</l>
                  <l>And make 'em excellent at laſt.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>How generouſly <hi>condeſcending</hi> and <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humour'd</hi> were you, when you wrote that Letter of the 10th, and how <hi>peeviſh</hi> and <hi>ſplenatic</hi> in that of the 12th: But I ought to be the laſt who ſhould arraign you, ſince I know, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Experience, it is not always to be avoided, nor will I ever complain of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0104100603:293"/>
Style when you take the Pains to write, and are not abſolutely angry. What Pity it is, that the brighteſt Genius ſhould not inhabit the ſtrongeſt Conſtitution; and that our Intellects muſt ſympathize with thoſe crazy Machines our Bodies, which, like Barome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are affected with every Change of Air; but 'tis always ſo, the richeſt Jewels are ſet in the moſt malleable Metals, and Braſs and Iron ſerve for Implements of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Uſe. It is very rare that one ſhall meet with a fine Genius, in a <hi>Herculean</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; and I am often induced to compare ſuch Perſons to great Houſes, where the Garrets are generally the worſt furniſh'd.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, however, they have an Advantage which the others wants, they are pleas'd better cheap, and as they have leſs Delicacy, they find no Difficulties to their Satisfaction. For it is certainly a Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to have a Taſte too refined for the Age one lives in, and to ſpin ſuch Cobweb No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Excellence, as 'tis probable one may never find but in one's own Treaſury of Ideas.</p>
               <p>I have often endeavour'd to correct in myſelf this Reſearch, after what <hi>Reaſon</hi> would perſuade me was a <hi>Non-Entity;</hi> but I could never make my Reliſh deſcend to the Common, the Modiſh Entertainment of Life; I have at laſt ſound the <hi>Phoenix</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0104100603:294"/>
I deſpair'd of, and met with a Perſon whoſe Sentiments and Delicacy moſt exactly tally with mine, and entirely happy ſhould I be in ſuch a Friendſhip, had He, <hi>Madam,</hi> but a little more Steadineſs; but alas! when I conſider his Paſſion for Novelties, <note n="*" place="bottom">Sir <hi>George Chudleigh</hi> was very much addicted to Women.</note> I muſt own I ſuffer all the Torments of a final Separation.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST Excellent Youth, this your Reception of me, in the Entrance of your Court, with your oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oration, is truly acceptable. I rejoyce not ſo much that I am, as that this Houſe is adorned thereby; which has always been eſteemed the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of ingenuous Education; and I am with Pleaſure induced to believe, that your Cotemporaries are in all Things like your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: In which Expectation, if I am not deceived, you may with Confidence aſſure yourſelves of ſuch Incouragment and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as I have Power to beſtow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0104100603:305"/>
Your Congratulation, ſelect Batchelour, and that of your Society, is the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to me, for that it proceeds from thoſe who are grown up to a Maturity of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, enlarged and perfected by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Inſtructions of Philoſophy, and other various Kinds of Learning. I wiſh I was altogether the Man, which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand from you, they take me to be. He I truly am, who with the utmoſt Satisfaction behold a Learned Body of young Men hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily preſſing after whatever is praiſe-worthy, and who cannot therefore but greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the growing Commendation of your Houſe. I know I ſhall hear much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Love of the profound Sciences, the commendable Courſe of your Studies, and the Progreſs of your Learning, from that worthy Man the Sub-Dean of this Houſe; whoſe Vigilance and Induſtry if I can any ways aſſiſt, he will find in me, when Occaſion offers, an active Sharer of his Care and Counſel.</p>
            <p>Moſt Eloquent Reader of Rhetoric, you indeed ſhew yourſelf well fitted to that your Province, which you have ſuſtained for many Years with Reputation; when hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſlender a Subject to work upon, you dignify and enlarge it, with a plentiful Flow of Words, and all the forceful Charms of Eloquence. Both I myſelf am but too
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0104100603:306"/>
conſcious, and you, notwithſtanding the great Things you ſay of me, cannot be inſenſible how little I deſerve theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations; yet with what Ingenuity and Modeſty do you treat me, when not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it convenient to admoniſh me publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you have Recourſe to thoſe Rules of your Art which ſay, That an Exhortation is then moſt effectual, when you extol him whom you mean to excite. If any there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, led away by this Kind of Speech, ſhould imagine that the Virtues recited are mine, great is his Miſtake; it was deſigned to a different Intent, that whilſt you thus diſcharged your own Duty, you might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind me of mine; and your whole Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was, that the Auditors of this Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick might underſtand not who I am, but what he ought to be that has the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to preſide in this flouriſhing College; who being placed over ſo numerous a Body of thoſe already Learned, and others yet a Learning, ſhould be ever mindful to defend the Cauſe of Religion, cultivate good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and promote ſound Literature; truly a very difficult Undertaking! however, you ſhew me the Way to make it eaſier, for even at this Inſtant, we cannot but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thoſe worthy Men my Predeceſſors in this Truſt; from which Remembrance you readily hit upon all thoſe Perfections re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0104100603:307"/>
to compoſe a Picture, highly finiſhed, of the Greateſt Man, and the moſt Skilful Governor.</p>
            <p>However, when I think of filling this Poſt, now fallen to my Lot, and conſider my own Abilities, there ariſes a Dread and Diffidence ſufficient to confound and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm me; nor am I ever ſo diſpirited or out of love with myſelf, as when <hi>Fell</hi> and <hi>Aldrich,</hi> thoſe two great Luminaries of your Commonwealth of Letters, preſent themſelves to my Remembrance; for who has not Reaſon to dread treading in the Paths they trod, who (being endowed with the choiceſt Gifts of Nature, furniſhed with a great Variety of Arts, exerciſed in a long Tract of Academical Employments) brought this Houſe, which ever had its Share of Glory, ever illuſtrious for its Praiſe of Learning, to the utmoſt Pitch of Splendor and Perfection.</p>
            <p>Both of them were eagerly ſtudious of Knowledge, and earneſtly diſpoſed to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the liberal Sciences: Both of them were poſſeſſed with extraordinary Candour, ſo as to cheriſh every Appearance of Virtue that preſented itſelf, ever interpreting fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably and to the milder Senſe, whatever bore the Face of Doubt: Both of them were noble and generous, not carried away with the Thirſt of Riches or of Honours:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0104100603:308"/>
They were careleſs of their private Affairs, but vigilant for the Public Good: No Man ever loved his Family more ardently, or cheriſhed it with more Affection, than both of them did this Houſe: No Man's Country was ever dearer to him, than this Univerſity to them: By their own Labour, by their own Coſt, to increaſe the Art of Printing, to repair, to rebuild theſe Walls; as it was always a Care to them, ſo was it a Pleaſure: With theſe Thoughts, with theſe Deſires were they employ'd when liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor was there any Intermiſſion to the Hour of their Deaths. You are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the Things I ſpeak of, which ſo lately were, and ſtill are in your Sight and Hearing; but be they rivetted ever ſo ſtrongly in your Minds, the Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them will always be a Pleaſure, and the Remembrance of them delightful, who excelled in every Qualification that could be in Man. The Image of that moſt humane Man can never be forgot by me or you, by whoſe Demiſe this Houſe, as tho' it were deprived of a Parent, now lies in Mourning and in Sorrow: God grant that now, by my coming among you, it may in ſome meaſure be refreſhed and comforted. To him nothing was wanting which indulgent Nature could beſtow, either to the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating or Embelliſhment of Learning; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0104100603:309"/>
which could excite either the Love or Admiration of thoſe over whom he preſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: What Perſpicuity, what Strength of Thought, what a ready Utterance was he endowed with, applying himſelf to different Kinds of Learning, with Eaſe and Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! Never at a Loſs, nor a Stranger to any Sort of Literature that was laid before him: Whatſoever he undertook in any Art, was performed to Exactneſs; ſo that one might ſay, he was alone born for that Part which he then ſuſtained, and that all his Time and Labour had been imployed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: Whether he followed more ſerious Studies, or delighted himſelf with thoſe of leſs Conſequence; whether he treated of divine or moral Subjects, you could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive which he was more capable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, this or that: But then, in his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and Converſation, in his Receſs and Buſineſs, how genteel was his Behaviour, how plain and open was his Mind! What Integrity in his Life, what Truth in his Words, what Modeſty in his Countenance, what Gracefulneſs in his Front! Adorned with theſe Gifts of Nature, that which often ſeems moroſe and ſevere in abſtraſe Learning, he was wont to allay, with a wonderful Pleaſantneſs; ſo that he could mould and form the Minds of young Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners, not barely by his Precepts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0104100603:310"/>
but by his Aſpect and engaging Manner, to the Love of Learning and all the Praiſes of Humanity. In this Man were many Things admirable, many Things excellent, but nothing more ſo, than that he held the Memory of bleſſed <hi>Fell</hi> in ſingular Regard and Veneration, looking upon him, and declaring him to be the unerring Guide and Pattern of all his public Actions, the beſt Maſter for the Inſtruction and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Youth, a Reſtorer of that Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline which was interrupted amongſt us in the Times of Diſtraction; and, in a Word, the Guardian Eſtabliſher of this ſpacious Building: And, truly, ever ſince a Way was opened for the Return of true Religion and ſound Learning to this Place, from whence it was driven. Whatſoever this Houſe hath contributed to the Help of Science, or the Increaſe of Piety; whatſoever Benefit hath accrued from it to the Church or State, all flows from the Labour, Care, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of that moſt holy Prelate: By him was laid the Foundation of our Praiſes; by him were ſown the Seeds of Virtue, Induſtry and Learning, which even now flouriſh, and which from him, both living and dead, hath ſo often ripened into a plenteous and joyful Harveſt.</p>
            <p>As often, therefore, as I conſider this Body ſtill flouriſhing by the Inſtructions of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0104100603:311"/>
               <hi>Fell,</hi> methinks I ſee that well planted Field, which <hi>Cyrus</hi> formerly ſhewed <hi>Lyſander,</hi> where, if I may ſay ſo, one might admire the Height, Ranks, and regular Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Trees, the Ground cultivated, ſmooth and clean, with the ſweet and flagrant Odor wafted from the Flowers, but above all, the Diligence and Induſtry of him by whom they were thus planted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.</p>
            <p>Happy that Huſbandman of ours, who can truly ſay with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> All theſe have I thus diſpoſed, mine is the Order, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is mine; many of theſe Trees have I alſo planted with my own Hands, for the Benefit of this, and, perhaps, of the coming Generation. To me therefore, in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this Office (ſhall I ſay it was a Happineſs or a Misfortune, immediately to ſucceed ſuch eminent Men) what now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, but that I, who am diffident of my own Abilities, ſhould rouſe myſelf up by the Contemplation of thoſe Virtues with which they excelled, and that thoſe beſt of Maſters whom I profitted by, when living, I ſhould copy after when dead, and look on them as Examples to be followed in all Things according to my Ability.</p>
            <p>They truly, by their excellent Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments obtained this, that they were ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſerviceable to you, which I too well
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0104100603:312"/>
know I can never attain to. There is one Thing, however, which I boaſt to ſhare in common with them. It is a certain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Degree of Love and good Will, which I bear towards this Houſe, by which I have at Heart, you and all your Intereſts. In this I truſt never to be out-done by any of thoſe my Anceſtors, with ſome of whom, in nothing elſe am I worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT He, may never be forgotten, who has raked the Repoſitaries of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and been indefatigable in fetching Learning from Places where many would not have ſought after it; a few Memorials of his Life, and ſome Obſervations on his Writings, will, we hope, redound to his Credit.</p>
               <p>In the Pariſh-Regiſter of <hi>Abbots,</hi> or <hi>White-Waltham,</hi> a Village about ſix Miles
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0104100603:323"/>
diſtant from <hi>Windſor,</hi> it ſtands upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that he was baptized by the Name of <hi>Thomas,</hi> Son of <hi>George Hearne</hi> and <hi>Edith</hi> his Wife on the Eleventh of <hi>June,</hi> 1678. His Father, we have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, was a conſiderable Antiquary of the lower Claſs; and was Sacriſtan of that Parochial Church to the Day of his Death. So that Mr. <hi>Hearne,</hi> in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, received his great Propenſity to the Study of Antiquity as it were <hi>ex Traduce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is agreed on all Hands that his early Inclination to Letters firſt diſcovered it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf among the <hi>Tumuli</hi> of his own Pariſh Church-yard; over which he was obſerved to be continually plodding lmoſt as ſoon as he was Maſter of the Engliſh Alphabet. To this ſoon after adding a little Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he grew impatient after Antiquity: reſolved never to be unprepared for col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting Materials that might be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hereafter, and accordingly ſtuffed his Diary (which was his conſtant Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) with every Occurrence worthy his Notice. This he prudently foreſaw would turn to a good Account in his more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced Years; Vacancies in his future Labours might be ſupplied with a Story from his Journal; and tho' it might not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0104100603:324"/>
be very methodical, or perhaps not at all to his Purpoſe in Hand, yet the Deſign of preſerving it might ſufficiently juſtify its Publication.</p>
               <p>This was the advantageous Method he purſued all his Life Time: He co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied <hi>Monuments</hi> and <hi>Inſcriptions; Original Letters</hi> and <hi>venerable Ballads of Antiquity;</hi> Stories of honeſt <hi>John Roſs</hi> and <hi>Peter Langtoft; Robert</hi> of <hi>Brune</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas Cantilupe:</hi> Men! who had not Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> lived, might have lain for ever buried in an ignoble Obſcurity. The Preſervation of theſe Things may be aſcribed to his <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectanea</hi> which are now ſwelled to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Size.</p>
               <p>It is difficult indeed to determine to what particular Number theſe MSS Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes are now grown, becauſe they are kept with as ſtrict and ſacred a Care from the Eyes of Mankind as the <note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi>'s Account of theſe choice <hi>Leaves</hi> in the 485 page of Vol. 2. of his <hi>Connection:</hi> where we find that none but the Keepers of them were ever ſuffered to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe them, and They only upon particular Exigencies.</note> Oracles of the <hi>Sibylls</hi> depoſited in the Capitol.

               <p>This Digreſſion we hope the Reader will pardon; and ſo, without dwelling on the firſt eight or ten Years of his Life, we ſhall follow him to the School, where we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0104100603:326"/>
are told he laid the Foundation of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Greatneſs.</p>
               <p>It was happy for him as well as the <hi>World</hi> that he fell into the Hands of a good <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Gibſon, <hi>Author of the excellent</hi> Grammatical Exceptions againſt the late Alterations made in the common Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence and Grammar.</note>Maſter at <hi>Bray</hi> School: it being a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly Thing to conſider how many great Genii have either been cramped or utterly ſpoiled thro' the Ignorance or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence of trifling Pedagogues.

                  </note> of the Pariſh where his Benefactor lived was at that Time a conſiderable Tutor in <hi>Edmund Hall,</hi> and in the Study of Antiquity moſt eminently remarkable. Thro' this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Means he was admitted into this Place, and uſed more like a Son than barely a Pupil by him.</p>
               <p>A few Years being ſpent in Academical Learning, by the Help of which he had improved his Propenſity to Antiquity; He gave the World a Specimen of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Deſigns. In the Year MDCCII (but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years from his Matriculation) he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a copious Index of the principal Paſſages in Sir <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange</hi>'s Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of <hi>Joſephus;</hi> which ſeems to have met with ſo good a Reception, that the ſame was reprinted not long after in an Octavo Edition. In MDCCIII he obliged the World with (or at leaſt occaſioned the Publication of) the <hi>Reliquiae Bodleianae,</hi> or ſome genuine Remains of Sir <hi>Thomas Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> adding the ſame Year, to his other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. <hi>Pliny</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtles</hi> and <hi>Panegyric,</hi> with various Lections and Annotations; not to mention his Edition of <hi>Eutropius,</hi> with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0104100603:328"/>
many other Things publiſhed all in this Year. In MDCCIV and V came out that laborious Work called <hi>Doctor Hiſtorious,</hi> in two Volumes, 8<hi>vo,</hi> being a ſhort Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of Univerſal Hiſtory, and an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the Study of it.</p>
               <p>It would be almoſt endleſs to expatiate particularly on his Labours, or to give an Account of the Product of every Year; for which Reaſon we muſt refer the Reader to his own printed Catalogue of them, inſerted at the End of every Book, he publiſhed, ſince they became numerous.</p>
               <p>During this Period however it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable that his <hi>Vindication</hi> of Thoſe who take the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which loudly ſpeaks in the Behalf of Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi>'s Induſtry, and ſhews the early Application he had made to Books. The many juſt Quotations in it from ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hiſtory as well as Profane, from Acts of Parliament and Lawyers of the greateſt Name, we flatter ourſelves will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe our writing a Panegyrick, and its Author's Name recommend it enough to the Peruſal of Mankind.</p>
               <p>In MDCCIII, on the 3d of <hi>July,</hi> he took the Degree of Maſter of Arts, and had
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0104100603:329"/>
no ſooner compleated it, but the Eyes of the whole Univerſity were upon him: His Induſtry was almoſt become a Proverb, and (notwithſtanding a little Surlineſs of Temper which it is thought he brought into the World with him, and which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably increaſed with his ſevere Studies) he met with Friendſhip in a great many, and much Reſpect from all Men,</p>
               <p>I ſhould have mentioned indeed before this, the Encouragement he had from the <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> Principal of St. <hi>Mary-Hall.</hi>
                  </note>Head Librarian, who (acquainted with his Diligence) made him Underkeeper of the <hi>Bodleian</hi> Library. There he had Room enough for his Inquiſitive Genius to range in; of which he made ſo good a Uſe, that the Product of every Year afterwards may juſtly be aſcribed to the Acquiſitions he had made in this Treaſure of Learning.</p>
               <p>After ſome Years ſpent in this Way, of printing <hi>Indexes, Itineraries</hi> and <hi>Collectanea,</hi> his Labours met with an additional Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; being on the 19th of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1714-15, elected <hi>Architypographus</hi> of the Univerſity and ſuperior <hi>Beadle</hi> of Civil Law <note n="†" place="bottom">

                  </note> This we find him acknowledging with Pleaſure and Humility to be an Honour, which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0104100603:330"/>

               </p>
               <p>In this happy Poſture of Affairs one would have imagined he might have been eaſy and ſatisfied: But neither Friendſhip nor Preferment could put a Stop to his Enquiry after <hi>Truth.</hi> Soon after this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion he acquired better Reaſons (to <hi>Himſelf</hi> at leaſt) for Non-Compliance with the Oaths which were neceſſary for <hi>keeping</hi> it, than he had before for the <hi>Acceptance</hi> of it; and accordingly reſigned that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Poſt, which the Univerſity had ſo lately conſered on him, as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent

               </p>
               <p>Ever ſince he ſteadily adhered to the Principles of a Non-juror; ſpent his Time in annually obliging the World with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing relating to the Hiſtory of <hi>England,</hi> or with ſome other Affairs as they accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have fallen in his Way, both for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and Pleaſure of Mankind.

               <p>It is obſervable here, in the fifth place, that <hi>Sprott</hi> lived (according to Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi>'s own Confeſſion) in 1274, which was in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt; that he Studied <hi>in ea parte Aedis Chriſti quam vulgo vocant Quadrangulum Cantuari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſe,</hi> and that he wrote of <hi>Canterbury College,</hi> and left a Book behind him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, is evident from the above-cited Preface to <hi>Sprott</hi>'s <hi>Chronicle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a very ſurpriſing <hi>Canterbury</hi> Tale indeed; and that would make <hi>Sprott</hi> (provided it could be proved) more Famous than the <hi>Samian</hi> Philoſopher, who, by the Help of Tranſmigration, paſſed thro' two or three Succeſſive Stages of Generation, but never under the ſame Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sprott,</hi> who lived in 1274, in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, ſtudied in <hi>Canterbury College,</hi> which was not built till 1363, and therefore agreeable to this Account, muſt either have lived about 89 Years before he was born, or at leaſt written

               <p>At the latter <note n="*" place="bottom">Pag. 405</note> End of the Life of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d, there is a <hi>Letter</hi> printed and Mr. (<hi>Hearne</hi> ſays an <hi>Original</hi> one) of

                  <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt when Prince of <hi>Wales:</hi> It is directed to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and interpreted by the <hi>Publiſher</hi> of it, as carrying on an Affair of Gallantry. Be the Letter what it will, <hi>Original</hi> or not, He ought to have given a better Reaſon for making it publick. He was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive (he tells us) that if ſuch a <hi>Letter</hi> ſhould be ſtifled, ſome Perſons might interpret it an Inſtance of Partiality, and be apt to make baſe Reflections upon it. Let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine this kind of Reaſoning a little. The ſtifling this <hi>Letter</hi> would have been thought an <hi>Inſtance</hi> of <hi>Partiality;</hi> The Reaſon of which muſt be this; Becauſe Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> was neceſſarily obliged to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh every Thing he met with. And then, he ſays, that ſome Perſons would be apt to make baſe Reflections on it: On the <hi>Letter</hi> we ſnppoſe, which if ſtifled, they might never ſee or hear of: Or if he meant thoſe Gentlemen who communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it to him, he again forgot his <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis Amor,</hi> becauſe they never intended it ſhould be printed. That it might eſcape therefore all <hi>Cenſure</hi> he publiſhed it in a heap of <hi>Appendixes</hi> and <hi>Curae ſecvndae,</hi> and made it a hundred Times more eaſy for baſe Reflections to be caſt on it than it was before.</p>

This is the <hi>Reaſon</hi> given for publiſhing this <hi>Letter.</hi> In the next Book printed by him, which was <hi>Trokelowe</hi>'s Annals of <hi>Edward</hi> the 2d) we have an Apology in his Preface for the very ſame Thing. The <hi>Letter</hi> became the Subject of almoſt every one's Diſcourſe, and a Reflection caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Prince, remarkable for his <hi>uncommon Chaſtity,</hi> could not but be taken Notice of by many of his Friends. Whether it had like to have diſcontinued any of his Subſcriptions, or whether he had more maturely conſidered the Matter, we cannot ſay; this however is plain, that his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> was deſigned to give a ſofter Turn, than was hinted in his <hi>Explanation</hi> of the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> and that he had rather have it thought, that the <hi>Prince</hi> was unwarily <hi>miſled,</hi> than <hi>inclined</hi> to this Gallantry.</p>
               <p>It had been more <hi>prudent</hi> (and we may add leſs <hi>officious</hi>) in Mr. <hi>Hearne,</hi> whilſt he was thus endeavouring to clear himſelf, to have firſt got leave for the Printing this Letter from the <hi>Gentleman</hi> who ſhewed it him, and who, we are informed ſince, ſo highly reſents it, that he broke off a Friendſhip with him, which had been kept very ſtrict for many Years. We muſt ſubjoin by the way, that it is certainly a greater Inſtance of <hi>Partiality</hi> to publiſh a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0104100603:344"/>
                  <hi>Letter</hi> as an <hi>Original,</hi> which the Editor could not at that Time, nor afterwards, prove to be ſo.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apology</hi> will appear, upon a little Conſideration, not at all inferior to his <hi>Reaſon</hi> for printing it; eſpecially if we obſerve, that tho' he did not know what the <hi>Intrigue</hi> was, yet he happily conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, by making the <hi>Prince</hi> to be inticed like <hi>Joſeph</hi> by the Importunity of a lewd Miſtreſs; tho' we do not remember that <hi>Joſeph</hi> ever wrote to a third Perſon about his Affair. Nay, it may be remarked farther, that Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> makes the <note n="*" place="bottom">This Blunder reached our Author's Ears, and in his Preface to <hi>Tho. Caius</hi> ſtands corrected, th with ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance.

               <p>Had this unfortunate <hi>Prince</hi> lived ſome hundred Years before he did, Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi>'s Love for <hi>Antiquity</hi> might probably have

doubt but that he retracted what he had ſaid in both Caſes, and fruſtrated the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of ſome People who thought he delighted in <hi>Abuſe,</hi> tho' we hope he acowledged our <hi>Friendſhip</hi> in ſetting him right.</p>

               <p>One Rule which we have been informed he at firſt laid down, and generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſely obſerved, was always to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Authors religiouſly.

The Word <hi>Longeſpe,</hi> inſerted in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, is not upon the Stone, how legible ſoever he aſſerted it to be; and the Spelling of <hi>Werwick</hi> quite altered by him, without the leaſt Authority whatever but his own.</p>
               <p>This Blunder may in ſome Meaſure be accounted for in this Manner.—There is now in the <hi>Anatomy School</hi> (which was formerly under the Care of Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi>) a Stone found at <hi>Rewly,</hi> (probably the Foundation-Stone of a Chapel there) bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Inſcription—ELE LONGESP COMIT: WAREW: HANC CAPELLAM FECIT: This no doubt had often been peruſed by our <hi>Antiquary,</hi> as well as the other before mentioned; and perhaps the

truſting too much to Memory, might raiſe a confuſed Notion of both Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and corrupt the <hi>Monkiſh Jingle</hi> in the former Caſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe few Miſtakes then having taken their Riſe from not ſticking cloſely to his <hi>Copy:</hi> we ſhall take Notice of but One more, which was occaſioned by following it too cloſely; and it may be ſeen in his Edition of that valuable <note n="*" place="bottom">MS.

               </p>
               <p>Let it be obſerved in the firſt Place, that this MS. is in very old Capital Letters, and each Page divided into two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns: The firſt contains the <hi>Latin,</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> is wrote collaterally in the other. Thro' the <hi>Oſcitancy</hi> of the Scribe, the <hi>Latin</hi> Sentence is frequently carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Bounds of its own Column, by which means it becomes intermixed with the <hi>Greek.</hi> The Text as he has printed it ſtands thus: <hi>viz.</hi>

At the Bottom of his Page (not contented

with Dr. <hi>Mills</hi>'s <hi>Reading.</hi>) he adds <hi>ſic plane in Codice noſtro non</hi>

                  <hi>ut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Millium;</hi> tho' it will appear beyond all Diſpute upon any one's Enquiry, that the Doctor was not in the leaſt to be blamed. For, as we obſerved before, thro' the Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs of the Scribe, the Latin Line be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing carried beyond its due Bounds into the Greek Column, and the Words MENTE and MEN TE conſiſting of five Capital Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, juſt the ſame in both Languages, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily led Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> into this Miſtake. So that by defalcating one Word from the Latin, and converting it into two Greek ones of no Signification at all, he ſpoiled the Senſe of the one, and made the other quite ſuperfluous.—But ſome Faults ſure are pardonable in ſo <hi>voluminous</hi> a Writer.</p>
               <p>To be particular in ſhewing his Talent at <hi>Reaſoning</hi> would, we fear, be making too free with our <hi>Reader</hi>'s Time: We might quote three Parts of his Diſcourſe on the <hi>Stunsfield Pavement,</hi> had not Mr. <hi>Peyntr</hi> thoroughly conſidered it already; and give ſuch Inſtances of it which nothing but <hi>Envy</hi> or <hi>Ill-Nature</hi> could find Fault with: But the following <hi>Epiſtle</hi> prevents our dwelling upon this Excellency, it being a Maſter-piece of its kind, and what the Reader, we hope, will be greatly delighted with.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0104100603:353"/>
But let the Epiſtle ſpeak for itſelf: There is one Paragraph in his <note n="*" place="bottom">Pag. 28, 29.</note>Preface to <hi>Sprott</hi>'s <hi>Chronicle,</hi> which really ſeems to be a new Method of <hi>Reaſoning,</hi> ſuch as no Writer but himſelf, we believe, dares lay any Claim to. He is there ſpeaking in <hi>Sprott</hi>'s Praiſe, and his Words are theſe—<q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Adeo ut non videam cur mihi ſit Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento, ſi publice declarem me opinari de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademia noſtra Oxonienſi Opus etiam juſtum ac diſtinctum contexuiſſe:</hi>
                  </q> And then comes the Reaſon in the very next Sentence, viz. <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Opinioni favet Auctoris Pietas. Quod ſi Tu aliter ſentias, Ego in Sententia non perſtabo</hi> nec <hi>quorſum recidant quaecunque animadverti magnopere laborabo, ſi modo il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lud conceſſeris de Collegio Cantuarienſi Opus poſt ſe reliquiſſe, in quo multa itidem de to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Academia è Monumentis praeclaris obiter notaverit.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Argument produced to prove that the Author of that <hi>lean Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle</hi> (whether <hi>Sprott</hi> or ſome other) it not clearly appearing that <hi>Sprott</hi> was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, compoſed many other valuable Books, not at all inferior to the <hi>Chronicle</hi> which is publiſhed. Great Pity indeed! that ſuch profitable Works ſhould be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0104100603:354"/>
in Obſcurity; and doubtleſs was there not ſome Hope of their being ſtill recoverable, <hi>Sprott</hi>'s Admirers (how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible ſoever in other Caſes) would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment greatly under their Loſs in this.</p>
               <p>Agreeable to this new Method of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning we find an uncommon Conjecture in his Preface to the Sixth Volume of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s <hi>Itinerary,</hi> which very few Writers would ever have made. From a Medal of <hi>Carauſius</hi> bearing this Inſcription, VICTORIA CEA, he endeavours to prove, that the Brogue of the common People is the true Standard of the <hi>Roman</hi> Dialect and Pronunciation. The Word <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this <hi>curious Remark,</hi> is not to be pronounced as it generally is by People of Faſhion and Breeding, <hi>Ceſar,</hi> but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the broad Manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſed by the moſt ruſtic of Mankind, and as it ſtands upon the Coin, CEASAR.</p>
               <p>We acknowledge the Obſervation to be a very curious one, and to ſtand upon the Authority of a Medal, but if it ſhould ever be diſcovered, that it proceeded from an Error of the <hi>Mint-Maſter,</hi> from a ſimple Literal Tranſpoſition, or from any other Accident (as poſſibly it might) the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark will then ſink into its Value; The
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0104100603:355"/>
Coin indeed may be curious upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Blunder, but is no more an Argument to aſcertain the Truth of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or Pronunciation, than that <hi>ſpurious Halfpenny</hi> of his preſent <hi>Majeſty,</hi> would be a Standard in the next Age for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing GEOGIVS inſtead of GEORGIVS.</p>
               <p>It would waſte too much of the Reader's Time probably, to offer here a Collection of all the Poetical Fragments ſcattered thro' his Labours; the Preſervation of which by Printing them, we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, ſhews no ſmall Deſire to be uſeful to Mankind, as theſe Rhythmes contain either Leſſons of Oeconomy; ſuch as,<q>

Now Sir, tho' I ſhould be as far from interrupting the indefatigable Labours of Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> in his Hiſtorical Studies as any Man living; yet I think no Man ought to be indefatigable in Slander, and that the Unchriſtian Temper he has ſhewn ought to be reprehended. And it gives me no ſmall Concern to find the grave Style of an Antiquarian changed to the foul-mouthed Language of the moſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned Proſtitute. Neither can I by any means agree, that whatever <hi>unguarded Expreſſions</hi> Mr. <hi>Moyle</hi> may have dropt, can be juſt Grounds of Provocation for ſuch Scurrility, as I believe never before fell from the Pen of any Controvertiſt. But Mr. <hi>Moyle</hi> has himſelf hit the right Nail on the Head in the Paſſage above cited. Mr. <hi>Moyle</hi> was a profeſſed <hi>Whig,</hi> and a hearty Well-wiſher to his Country. Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> is a profeſſed <hi>Non-Juror,</hi> and a fiery Bigot to thoſe of his own Principles. With him, Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the XI, and Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> were equally Infallible, and, in the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, I believe ſo too. Mr. <hi>Moyle,</hi> as a <hi>Whig,</hi> muſt be <hi>a Republican, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner of Religions; one who had a natural Antipathy to the Clergy and their Friends, a meer Ignoramus,</hi> and, in good Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Charity, <hi>gone to the Devil.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0104100603:365"/>
help therefore asking you, Sir, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you really think the Poſitions advanced by Mr. <hi>Moyle</hi> in his <hi>Leſcard</hi>-Charge, or any part of his Conduct to which you were ever a Witneſs, could deſerve ſuch Treatment, eſpecially from one who never knew him otherwiſe than by his Writings.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Critical Diſpute,</hi> I ſhall be as ſilent as I reſolve to be about the <hi>Legendary one</hi> above mentioned. Yet I cannot help obſerving, that what Dr. <hi>Woodward</hi> ſays, is very merrily dogmatical. For, he will have it that Mr. <hi>Hearne forms a right Judgment of all Mr.</hi> Moyle<hi>'s Works,—becauſe the beſt Antiquaries have judged his Shield to be a</hi> Clypeus Votivus. And Mr. <hi>Moyle</hi> is highly criminal, <hi>and paſſes Sentence upon it, without ever having ſeen it,</hi> otherwiſe than by two Draughts. Now I would only ask the learned Doctor one plain Queſtion; <hi>If I ſee the Picture of a Horſe,</hi> am I to believe the <hi>living Animal</hi> it repreſents to be a <hi>Bear?</hi> But indeed he deſcends a little, and ſays, That <hi>the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> Spanheim <hi>and Mr.</hi> Sellers intended to write Diſſertations upon it, and that ſome other Antiquarians really believed it to be an Antique; <hi>(anglice)</hi> the Back of an Old Sconce, which I have been credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed he bought in <hi>Rag-Fair.</hi>

As to that Piece of Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s, which Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> complains is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly printed, it is to be hoped he will oblige the learned World with a more correct Copy; tho' this Imputation does not lye againſt Mr. <hi>Moyle,</hi> but againſt the <hi>Perſon</hi> who tranſmitted that Piece to him.</p>
                     <p>May Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> hereafter retain a more Chriſtian Temper.

In the firſt place you will have it, that all who diſſent from Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> are <hi>a ſet of abandoned Wretches, and ſuch indeed was</hi> Walter Moyle <hi>

Wherein is evidently ſhewed, That the common Good of a Nation is what is primarily and principally reſpected in an Oath, and therefore when the Oath is inconſiſtent with that, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have taken it, are abſolved from it. In proving of which, the</hi> Caſe <hi>of</hi> Maud <hi>and King</hi> Stephen <hi>is particularly conſidered. In a Letter to a Non-Juror.</hi> Conſcientia mille Teſtes.

               <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>NE muſt have but little Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of human Nature, not to be ſenſible of that Curioſity which prompts Mankind to be acquainted with the Hiſtory of Perſons diſtinguiſhed by their extraordinary Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Qualifications, and who have experienced many uncommon Varieties of Life. In reading their Tranſactions, we become agreeably intimate with the Characters which have raiſed our Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; we attend them in the different Scenes thro' which they paſs, and are ſenſible of a ſecret Longing to imitate the ſhining Parts of their Conduct: They frequently teach us an eaſy Moderation in Proſperity, and are no leſs ſucceſsful in reconciling us to the ſevere Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0104100603:390"/>
THE Impreſſions we receive from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Characters, are more lively and affecting than ſuch as are imparted to us by moral Precepts; and thoſe Virtues, which Inſtitutions of Philoſophy might give us but a languid Invitation to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, are altogether irreſiſtable, when they are ſet off by the Conduct of Perſons of Elevation; and they muſt be thrown into Action, in order to give them their laſt Poliſh and Refinement.</p>
               <p>THIS may be one Reaſon why Bio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy has generally met with ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Reception, and we may venture to affirm, that if the Authors who engage in this Kind of Writing, would ſelect ſuch Characters as are entertaining, and inſtructive at the ſame Time, they would have no Cauſe to complain of any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard from the Public.</p>
               <p>THE noble Lady, who is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the following Memoirs, has made ſo conſpicuous and engaging a Figure, thro' the ſeries and Viciſſitudes of a long Life, that ſhe may be juſtly reputed an Honour to her own Sex, as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0104100603:391"/>
ſhe has always been the Admiration of ours.</p>
               <p>IF a Deſcent from an illuſtrious Race of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nobility, a polite and generous Education, an early Familiarity with the moſt amiable Accompliſhments, an inchanting Harmony of Perſon and Mind, a Virgin Purity of Youth, and a taintleſs Fidelity of conjugal Life, have any Charms in the ſofter Sex, they have all lent their full Luſtre to the late Dutcheſs of <hi>ORMONDE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT ſhould ſeem as if Providence intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to guard this Lady from every Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that could be formed againſt her by envious and detracting Minds, and therefore would not confine her Virtues to Scenes of Satisfaction and Proſperity; ſhe had long convinced the World of her Ability to act an unexceptionable Part in ſuch a Situation, but ſomething ſtill remained to give her Conduct its full Perfection. The appointed Period ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived; this incomparable Perſon was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the deareſt of all her Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: She ſaw herſelf for ever ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from her darling Conſort, and her former Affluence contracted into a very
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0104100603:392"/>
moderate Limitation: Her Sunſhine of Happineſs darkened with Adverſity; but that Adverſity only gave her an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of charming all who knew her, by her inimitable Reſignation to the Decrees of Heaven.</p>
               <p>AS there was Reaſon to believe the Public would be curious to know the Particulars of a Life ſo diverſified by ſuch unuſual Events, all poſſible Care has been taken to collect every authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Circumſtance that could make ſuch a Relation uſeful and entertaining; and, we preſume, that the Impartiality with which we have proceeded, on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, will intitle this Performance to a candid Reception from thoſe who are pleaſed to favour it with their Peruſal.</p>

THE moſt noble Houſe of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> as it was auguſt in its Original, ſo it has been perpetuated by a Train of Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, who have been juſtly eſteemed the Ornaments of their Country. And the great <hi>Plantagenets,</hi> who founded this illuſtrious Family, have tranſmitted their Virtues thro' a long Series of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, and adorned the Kingdom with a Progeny, of both Sexes, which will be ever remembered with Honour.</p>
               <p>THE Dutcheſs of <hi>ORMONDE</hi> was born at <hi>Beaufort</hi>-Houſe, near <hi>Chelſea, Anno</hi> 1665; and, in her early Years, preſented ſuch a Dawn of amiable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to her noble Parents, as convinced them that the Luſtre of their Family would receive no Diminution from their lovely Daughter. Animated by this Perſuaſion, they were particularly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to cultivate, by a ſuitable Education, the Virtues which had already ſprung up in her Mind with ſuch a luxuriant Bloom. Their Cares ſucceeded to their Wiſh, and there was no Accompliſhment neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to give Perfection to her Sex, but what appeared with all its Charms in the Conduct of this young Lady.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0104100603:395"/>
NATURE ſometimes preſents us with a great deal of Inequality in her Produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and it is no uncommon Thing to ſee a very diſagreeable Exterior allotted to a finiſhed Mind; but ſhe now determined to be uniform in her Operations, and prepared, for the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi>'s Daughter, a Form as amiable, as the Soul which was to claim it, for her Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>IT would require a Pen, much more maſterly in Deſcription than mine, to give the Reader a competent Idea of this engaging Lady; the inchanting Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of her Shape, the Luſtre and Viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of her Eyes, which inſpired all who beheld them with unutterable Impreſſions; the glowing Bluſh of the Roſe, which was blended in her Cheeks with the Virgin Purity of the Lilly, the flowing Shade of Hair which wantoned in a Profuſion of Ringlets, that no Pencil could imitate; the delicate Turn of her Face, and the bewitching Softneſs which diffuſed itſelf thro' every Feature; the panting Snow of her Boſom, and the taper Whiteneſs of her Arms; with a thouſand other Beauties which perpetually played around her, formed ſuch an Aſſemblage of Perfection,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0104100603:396"/>
that was to be reſiſted by nothing but Inſenſibility itſelf.</p>
               <p>WE believe we ſhall not be taxed with Falſhood, when we affirm, that ſuch a Prodigality of Charms were capable, without any other Aſſiſtance, of capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating a thouſand Hearts; but we have already intimated that Nature diſcarded all Partiality in her Plan, and made this irreſiſtable Form the Reſidence of a Soul which was altogether as attractive as its lovely Manſion: The moſt refined Poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of her Wit was contraſted by the ſedateſt Judgment; and each of theſe fine Qualifications were ſo beautifully ſoftened by her native Sweetneſs of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that her Pleaſantry never gave Pain, and none ever thought themſelves inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her ſuperior Penetration.</p>
               <p>THE Happineſs of her Memory facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated her Improvement, by thoſe Books and Induſtry, with which ſhe was daily converſant; and, in a few Years, it proved ſuch a Treaſury of Knowledge and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, as few Ladies of her Age were ever enriched with: The little Levities of the Sex, and thoſe refined Deviations from Sincerity and Sanctity of Manners, which are become ſo faſhionable a Part
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0104100603:397"/>
of modern Education were altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to her. True Virtue is certainly amiable in herſelf, but ſhe puts on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled Charms when ſhe ſhines in the Conduct of a blooming Virgin.</p>
               <p>SUCH was the Lady we are deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; her Mind was as immaculate as her Face, and every Year that added to her Youth, preſented her with new Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and awaken'd a general Curioſity to know what happy Man was to be bleſs'd with the Endearments of her nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Love.</p>
               <p>IT is not to be imagined in what Manner that pleaſing Expectation influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced ſome of the nobleſt of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Youth. A virtuous young Lady of Rank and Beauty is a publick Bleſſing, ſhe civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizes the Souls of her Admirers more than all their Academical Inſtitutions, and fires them to aim at a proper Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Accompliſhments. Innocence, Purity and Honour appear ſo perſuaſive in the Fair-One, that it is no Wonder if ſhe daily increaſes the Number of their Votaries, and brings them freſh Acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Homage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0104100603:398"/>
AMONGST the ſhining Crouds of Adorers who wiſhed to inſpire her with the ſoft Senſibility of Love, none made ſo conſpicuous a Figure as the Duke of <hi>Ormonde;</hi> he was deſcended from a very antient and illuſtrious Family that had given many Heroes to their Country, and, in the Perſon of the Duke, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it with an Ornament that did not a little contribute to its Luſtre. Death had for ſome Time deprived him of his firſt Lady (who was the eldeſt Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Rocheſter</hi>) and left him a Widower in the full Bloom of his Youth. His endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Behaviour to his deceaſed Dutcheſs, warmed many of the faireſt with ſecret Wiſhes to ſucceed her in his Embraces. His Perſon was ſuch as might impart the ſofteſt Impreſſions to the chaſteſt Heart, and was ſet off by ſuch a winning Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of Sweetneſs, Generoſity, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other Quality which conſtitutes the fine Gentleman, that it was almoſt impoſſible for him to be long conſidered with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference by any Lady to whom he breathed his Paſſion. We may add to this, that he poſſeſſed ſuch a Princely Eſtate, that Fortune ſeemed to contend with Nature which of them ſhould be his greateſt Benefactor. It is true, the Duke
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0104100603:399"/>
only valued the Favours of the former, as they enabled him to diſtinguiſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by numberleſs Acts of Humanity, and indulged him in his natural Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to Benevolence. And if the Goddeſs has not of late been ſo liberal to many others, it may have proceeded from their being deſtitute of his Inclinations to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate her Bounties to their Fellow Creatures.</p>
               <p>AFTER the Account I have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give of theſe two illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it will be natural to conclude, that they were formed for each other; and therefore, without entering into the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of that tender Intercourſe which Love, and a Similitude of Diſpoſitions, eſtabliſhed between them, it will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient if we acquaint the Reader, that his Grace was ſo fortunate in his Addreſſes, as to prevail on the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi>'s charming Daughter to conſent to be the lovelieſt Bride in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Number of the young Dutcheſs's Admirers was not diminiſhed by her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and tho' they found themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from diſcloſing to her the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with which her Charms had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired them, yet there were ſeveral who

               <p>IT often happens, that Men of Wit, thro' too much Partiality to themſelves, are apt to fancy that a Lady's Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Converſation, muſt create a Fondneſs for their Perſons, and the Earl did not fail to impute to the Dutcheſs, Impreſſions in his Favour, which ſhe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was never ſenſible of; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he was always ready to improve every Inſtance of her Complacency too much to his own Advantage. The Opinion he entertained of his being more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her than he really was, made him look on the diſhonourable Conduct he was meditating againſt the Duke, as a Crime that was capable of a very eaſy Vindication, he thought it more hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable to ſucceed with the Dutcheſs, than to preſerve Fidelity in his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to her Lord; and to ſuch an Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation was he hurried by his guilty Love, that he imagined it to be the moſt criminal Action in the World to neglect the Happineſs which his Vanity repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Dutcheſs inclinable to afford him.</p>

IN Conſequence of this Perſuaſion, as he had the Honour one Evening to lead her Grace from the Drawing Room, he ſlipt a Letter into her Hand, as ſhe was ſtepping into her Coach, and then retired with a profound Reverence. The Lady believed the Paper contained ſome agreeable Piece of Poetry, in which the Earl, as we intimated before, was very happy, and was impatient to read this new Product of his Capacity: But who can deſcribe her Confuſion and Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when ſhe found it to be a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Love, and her Diſpleaſure was the greater, as ſhe was conſcious that no Part of her Conduct could poſſibly give that Nobleman any Pretentions to the indecent Preſumption with which he treated her; and tho' it was late at Night, ſhe reſolved to acquaint the Dutcheſs her Mother with the Affront that had been offered to her Virtue.</p>
               <p>SHE accordingly ordered her Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to drive to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>'s Houſe, and, at her Arrival there, went into her Grace's Bed-Chamber, and intreated her, with a Flood of Tears, to read the Letter ſhe put into her Hands.

to ſee her Daughter in a Diſorder of Mind intirely new to her, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately read over the Letter, with an Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment natural to ſuch an Event. <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Is it poſſible, Madam,</hi> ſaid the Dutcheſs of <hi>Ormonde, that any Man can dare to think he has a Privilege to treat me in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable Manner! I can appeal to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, that my Conduct has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been without Reproach, which makes this Violation of the Reſpect due to me, ſo inſupportable.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THE Dutcheſs of <hi>Beaufort</hi> was as much diſſatisfied with this Adventure, as her Daughter, and was juſtly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that it might be attended with very fatal Conſequences; to prevent which, all imaginable Diſcretion was neceſſary.</p>
               <p>WHILST they were deliberating what Steps were moſt proper to be taken in ſo delicate an Affair, a Lady of great Quality, and a near Relation to them both, came in very ſeaſonably to aſſiſt at the Conſultation; and after ſhe had heard a particular Account of the whole Affair, ſhe gave it as her Opinion, that <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>it would be moſt proper for the Dutcheſs of</hi> Ormonde <hi>to diſſemble her Reſentment, and treat the amorous Peer with ſuch an</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0104100603:405"/>
                     <hi>Air of Indifference, as would effectually mortify his Vanity, and diſcourage him from perſiſting in his criminal Deſires:</hi> The Lady added, <hi>that if ſuch a Courſe of Behaviour ſhould not have the Effect that might be reaſonably expected, ſhe would undertake to diſcloſe the Affair to the Duke of</hi> Ormonde, <hi>in ſuch a Light as ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him to come into a Scheme ſhe had formed for making this new Lover the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the whole Town.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS Advice was allowed to be juſt, and, after ſome farther Conſideration, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Ormonde</hi> took her Leave, with a Determination to conduct herſelf according to her Relations Sentiments. It was not long before the young Earl ſaw her, and, as he was pleaſed to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf, that the Graces of his Wit and Perſon were irreſiſtable, he was not a little ſurpriſed at the negligent Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the Dutcheſs heard all the fine Things he ſaid to her; and as he found that he had not made the leaſt Impreſſion on her Heart, he began to imagine ſhe might poſſibly not have read his Letter, for he could not believe that ſo much premeditated Wit and Tenderneſs as it contained, could prove ineffectual; and therefore reſolved to be certain that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0104100603:406"/>
his next Letter ſhould be read by the Dutcheſs; for which Purpoſe, he found Means to gain, as he imagined, one of her Women to his Intereſt; he made her a Preſent of a large Purſe of Gold, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying it with a ſecond Billet, which he intreated her to deliver into her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's Hands, and, at the ſame Time, gave her to underſtand, that if ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted herſelf of the Confidence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in her, to his Satisfaction, there was nothing ſhe might not promiſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from his future Bounty.</p>
               <p>THE Dutcheſs's Woman performed her Commiſſion, and gave the Letter to her Lady, with a particular Account of the Earl's Liberality, and all the large Promiſes he had made her. The Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs, after ſhe had read the Letter, made her Mother, and the other Lady, who had inſtructed her how to behave, acquainted with the Contents; upon which they thought it now a proper Time to make the Duke of <hi>Ormonde</hi> privy to the Secret. This they did, in ſuch a Manner as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſpoſed his Grace to come into their Meaſures, to make his Rival as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as his Vanity ought to render him. To accompliſh which, it was agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that the Dutcheſs ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0104100603:407"/>
her Lover's Letter, and it is eaſy to imagine, that an Epiſtle dictated by ſuch Perſons, and on ſuch an Occaſion, was artful enough to deceive, even a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Earl's Penetration. It would be no diſagreeable Entertainment to the Reader, could I repeat all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Things, and the diverting Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances that were invented by this illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Company, to expoſe the preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lover. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Ormonde</hi> was for having him <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>privately admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Houſe, and ſhut up in ſome Place where he might be half frozen, before he ſhould be ſet at Liberty:</hi>
                  </q> But the Duke replied, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>That would be a Management of too low a Turn for the Earl's nice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Taſte,</hi>
                  </q> and then recollecting, that his Garden Wall was of a very conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Heighth, he thought it would be beſt <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>for the Lover to climb over it, in order to come to his Lady, the Danger and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty only tending to compleat the Glory of ſuch a gallant Adventure; beſides,</hi> added he, <hi>we ſhall by this Means ſee whether his Lordſhip is in earneſt, and dare ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his fine Perſon in the Proſecution of his Amour.</hi>

into the Garden to examine the Wall, and, obſerving a Place that had Hooks, which a Ladder might be commodiouſly faſtened to, the Dutcheſs's Woman had Directions to deſcribe this convenient Situation to the Earl; but it was not done till ſeveral Letters had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the Dutcheſs, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came perſuaded, that his Addreſſes were as ſucceſsful as he could wiſh. And now the Dutcheſs's Woman acquainted him, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>he had made all imaginable Impreſſions on her Lady, and that ſhe expected the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Company with the greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, but then,</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>it will be impoſſible for your Lordſhip to paſs by the Porter in any Diſguiſe; and you are not inſenſible what Regard is due to a Lady's Reputation, in an Affair of this Nature, and therefore ſome Expedient muſt be thought of, to prevent any Diſcovery of your being admitted into my Lady's Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THE Earl, upon this, gave her the ſtrongeſt Aſſurances of his ſtrict Regard for the Dutcheſs's Honour; <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I am deſirous of being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in any Manner you can contrive, to prevent my being diſcovered by any of the Servants, and there is no Danger, that I</hi>

                     <hi>will ever decline to accompliſh my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with all the Privacy my lovely Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs can poſſibly deſire.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THE Gentlewoman finding him in ſuch a Reſolution, thought it then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to acquaint him, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>That no Way would be more effectual, to prevent the Affair from being detected, than for his Lordſhip to climb over the Garden-Wall,</hi>
                  </q> and then ſhe deſcribed that particular Part of it, where the Hooks were faſtened; <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>your Lordſhip,</hi> added ſhe, <hi>is too gallant, to heſitate at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny little Danger that you may be expoſed to, on ſuch an Occaſion, and you are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to conſider, that you could not have a more favourable Opportunity of convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Lady, that your Paſſion for her, can make you deſpiſe every Hazard and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty that may lie between you and the Happineſs you are in Purſuit of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if your Lordſhip has no Objection to what I have been propoſing, I will be, at Eleven this Night, in the Garden to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>HIS Lordſhip was ſo animated, with the Hopes of his imagined Joys, that he told the Gentlewoman, in a Kind of Tranſport, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>That he thought Fortune was very propitious to him, in giving him ſuch</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0104100603:410"/>
                     <hi>an Opportunity of convincing her Lady how much his Paſſion could ſurmount eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Danger and Impediment;</hi>
                  </q> upon which he took his Leave, with a ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to be punctual to the appointed Time; and then went to pay a Viſit to the Duke of <hi>Ormonde,</hi> by whom, as was before obſerved, he was treated with the greateſt Friendſhip and Intimacy.</p>
               <p>THE Duke received him with his uſual Affability, and after ſome Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, walked with him in his Garden, where he could not forbear ſmiling to himſelf, to obſerve, with what a curious Eye his Viſitor examined rhe Wall he was to ſcale that Evening. After they had taken a few Turns, the Earl took his Leave, and went to his own Houſe, where he paſſed the Remainder of the Day with all the impatient Deſires, natural to a Lover, who expects the happy Period of all his Wiſhes. The appointed Hour was, at laſt, come, and his Lordſhip did not fail to be exactly punctual at the Place agreed on, where he found the Ladder of Ropes thrown over the Wall, by the Means of which he mounted to the Top, with wonderful Activity, and from thence, as nimbly deſcended into the Garden: But, alas! how frequently
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0104100603:411"/>
do Diſappointments and Diſgrace attend the fineſt Schemes of poor Mortals; and how common is it for Men to meet with the moſt diſagreeable Accidents, in the very Inſtant that he promiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf nothing but Rapture, and the moſt perfect Felicity! The adventrous Peer had no ſooner ſet Foot on the fatal Ground, than the Gardener, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be a very ſturdy Fellow, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to miſtake him for a Perſon who intended to rob the Houſe, fell upon him with Herculean Force, and gave him ſuch a vigorous Drubbing, that he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to cry out for Aſſiſtance. The Noiſe alarmed the Houſe, and the Duke, with all the Company, who were then at Supper with him, came out in a ſeeming Surpriſe to know the Occaſion of the Clamours they heard. Any one will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the unfortunate Lover made no very graceful Figure in ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture; and, as it was impoſſible for the Spectators of his Diſgrace, to keep their Countenances, he grew ſenſible, that this had been a premeditated Scheme to expoſe him. But, as he had a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Preſence of Mind, and was, likewiſe, one of thoſe Philoſophic Lovers, who never run diſtracted at the Diſappoinment of their Paſſion, he asked the Duke's
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0104100603:412"/>
Pardon for the Folly he had committed, deſiring his Grace to impute it to a youthful Inconſideration he would no longer indulge; after which, he joined with the Company in their Mirth, and rallied himſelf very pleaſantly for the Diſcipline he had received from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Gardiner.</p>
               <p>THE Earl's ill Succeſs in his Amour, ſoon became public, and was, for a conſiderable Time, the Entertainment of all the gay Company about the Court; and beſides this, it entirely extinguiſhed the Hopes of all who ſighed for the amiable Dutcheſs in Secret. They were convinced, that her Vertue was impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and that it was poſſible for a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be the faireſt of her Sex, and, at the ſame Time, capable of preſerving an untainted Fidelity to her Nuptial Vow.<note n="*" place="bottom">The foregoing was an Adventure of the late Duke of <hi>Buckinghamſhire</hi> when he was Earl of <hi>Mulgrave.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>ANY one will eaſily believe, that the Duke, after this amiable Proof of his Lady's Virtue, could not but cheriſh ſuch a Treaſure with the utmoſt Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and, indeed, our noble Pair lived in ſo mutual an Intercourſe of Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as rendered them the Envy and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0104100603:413"/>
Admiration of the Age. I ſay, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, becauſe there have been People ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious enough to declare, that the Dutcheſs, ſome time after her Marriage, entertained ſuch a Fondneſs for Cards, as in a great Meaſure alienated the Duke's Affection from her for a conſiderable Time. But whilſt ſome have been ſo ungenerous as to propagate ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and others ſo weak as to believe it, all muſt acknowledge this to be the only Frailty that was ever imputed to that Lady, and even this has been aggravated much beyond the Reality of the Fact. The Truth is, Cards being at that Time, as well as now, the faſhionable Amuſement of the Fair, it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Dutcheſs, whoſe Houſe was continually filled with the beſt Company in the Kingdom, to do otherwiſe than comply with the Inclinations of her Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors in that Diverſion; and it may be true, that ſhe might ſometimes ſit up late at Play to oblige her Company, and we will not deny, that the Duke might be ſenſible of ſome Uneaſineſs to find his Lady compelled by the reigning Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum among the Great, to be abſent more Hours from him, than were agreeable to her Inclinations. But, at the ſame Time, in Juſtice to the Memory of that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0104100603:414"/>
Lady, we muſt affirm, That the Moment ſhe was ſenſible of the leaſt Uneaſineſs in her Lord on that Account, ſhe never after would ſuffer Play to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her from him, to any late or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable Hour. A ſingular Inſtance this, of a Lady, who could reſolve to ſacrifice what was then thought an innocent Amuſement, to the Repoſe of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort; whereas the ſame Motive now, is frequently inſufficient to make Numbers of the Sex reſign Pleaſures that are really criminal and injurious to their own and their Husband's Reputation. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to this noble Pair.</p>
