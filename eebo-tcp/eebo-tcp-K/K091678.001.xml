            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
                  <p>THIS Work was begun a great number of years paſt, when the empire of <hi>Great Britain</hi> was entire, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the northern part of the New World with envied ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. At that period I formed a deſign of collecting materials for a partial Hiſtory of its Animals; and with true pains, by various correſpondencies, made far greater progreſs in my plan than my moſt ſanguine expectations had framed. Above a century ago, an illuſtrious predeceſſor in the line of Natural Hiſtory, who as greatly exceeded me in abilities as he did in zeal, meditated a voyage to the New World, in purſuance of a ſimilar deſign. The gentleman alluded to was FRANCIS WILLUGHBY, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who died in 1672, on the point of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his deſign in execution. Emulous of ſo illuſtrious an example, I took up the object of his purſuit; but my many relative duties forbade me from carrying it to the length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by that great and good man. What he would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, from an actual inſpection in the native country of the ſeveral ſubjects under conſideration, I muſt content myſelf to do, in a leſs perfect manner, from preſerved ſpecimens tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me; and offer to the world their Natural Hiſtory, taken from gentlemen or writers who have paid no ſmall attention to their manners.</p>
                  <p>Let me repeat, that this Work was deſigned as a ſketch of the Zoology of <hi>North America.</hi> I thought I had a right to
<pb facs="tcp:0591300301:4"/>
the attempt, at a time I had the honor of calling myſelf a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſubject with that reſpectable part of our former great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; but when the fatal and humiliating hour arrived, which deprived <hi>Britain</hi> of power, ſtrength, and glory, I felt the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication which muſt ſtrike every feeling individual at loſing his little ſhare in the boaſt of ruling over half of the New World. I could no longer ſupport my clame of entitling myſelf its humble Zoologiſt: yet, unwilling to fling away all my labors, do now deliver them to the Public under the title of the ARCTIC ZOOLOGY. I added to them a deſcription of the Quadrupeds and Birds of the north of <hi>Europe</hi> and of <hi>Aſia,</hi> from latitude 60 to the fartheſt known parts of the <hi>Arctic</hi> World, together with thoſe of <hi>Kamtſchatka,</hi> and the parts of <hi>America</hi> viſited in the laſt voyage of the illuſtrious COOK. Theſe additional parts I have flung into the form of an Appendix to each ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, and diſtinguiſhed by a <hi>fleur de lis;</hi> and the ſpecies by literal inſtead of numeral marks, which diſtinguiſh thoſe of <hi>North America.</hi> Theſe will, in a great meaſure, ſhew the dilatation of Quadrupeds and Birds, and the migrations of the feathered tribe, within part of the northern hemiſphere.</p>
                  <p>I have, whenever I could get information, given their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive reſidences, as well as migrations to far more northern parts, to ſhew to what very remote places the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath impelled them to retire, to breed in ſecurity. This wiſe proviſion preſerves the ſpecies entire, and enables them to return by myriads, to contribute to the food or luxuries of ſouthern climates. Whatever is wanting in the <hi>American</hi> part, I may foreſee, will in time be amply ſupplied. The powers of literature will ſoon ariſe, with the other ſtrengths of the new empire, and ſome native Naturaliſt give perfection to that
<pb facs="tcp:0591300301:5"/>
part of the undertaking, by obſervations formed on the ſpot, in the uſes, manners, and migrations. Should, at preſent, no one be inclined to take the pen out of my hand, remarks from the other ſide of the <hi>Atlantic,</hi> from any gentlemen of conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſtudies, will add peculiar pleaſure to a favorite purſuit, and be gratefully received.</p>
                  <p>I muſt reckon among my moſt valued correſpondents on the New Continent, Doctor ALEXANDER GARDEN<note n="*" place="bottom">Now reſident in <hi>London.</hi>
                     </note>, who, by his long reſidence in <hi>South Carolina,</hi> was enabled to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to me variety of curious remarks and ſubjects, as will appear in the following pages.</p>
                  <p>To the rich muſeum of <hi>American</hi> Birds, preſerved by Mrs. ANNA BLACKBURN, of <hi>Orford,</hi> near <hi>Warrington,</hi> I am indebted for the opportunity of deſcribing almoſt every one known in the provinces of <hi>Jerſey, New York,</hi> and <hi>Connecticut.</hi> They were ſent over to that Lady by her brother, the late Mr. <hi>Aſhton Blackburn;</hi> who added to the ſkill and zeal of a ſportſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the moſt pertinent remarks on the ſpecimens he col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for his worthy and philoſophical ſiſter.</p>
                  <p>In the foremoſt rank of the philoſophers of the Old Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, from whoſe correſpondence I have benefited, I muſt place Doctor PETER SIM. PALLAS, at preſent Profeſſor of Natural Hiſtory in the ſervice of the illuſtrious EMPRESS of <hi>Ruſſia:</hi> he not only favored me with the fulleſt remarks on the Zoological part of that vaſt empire, moſt of which he formed from actual travel and obſervation, but collected for my uſe various other remarks from the manuſcripts of his predeceſſors; eſpecially what related to <hi>Kamtſchatka</hi> from thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:0591300301:6"/>
of STELLER; which have aſſiſted me in the hiſtory of parts hitherto but very ſlightly underſtood.</p>
                  <p>From the correſpondency and labors of Mr. EBERH. AUG. WILLIAM ZIMMERMAN, Profeſſor of Mathematics at <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wic,</hi> I have collected moſt uncommon inſtruction. His <hi>Specimen Zoologiae Geographicae Quadrupedum</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">A quarto in <hi>Latin,</hi> containing 685 pages, printed at <hi>Leyden,</hi> 1777; ſold in <hi>London</hi> by Mr. <hi>Faden,</hi> Geographer, <hi>St. Martin's Lane.</hi>
                     </note> is a work which gives a full view of the claſs of Quadrupeds, and the progreſs they have made in ſpreading over the face of the earth, according to cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates and latitudes. Their limits are deſcribed, in general, with uncommon accuracy. Much is ſaid of the climates themſelves; of the varieties of mankind; of the effects of heat and cold on them and other animals. A moſt curious map is joined to the work, in which is given the name of every animal in its proper cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; ſo that a view of the whole Quadruped creation is placed before one's eyes, in a manner perfectly new and inſtructive<note n="†" place="bottom">A new edition of the map has been lately publiſhed by the learned Author; the geographical part is corrected according to the late voyages of Captain COOK, and great additions made to the zoological part. An explanation is given, in the third volume of the <hi>Zoologia Geographica,</hi> lately publiſhed in <hi>German</hi> by the Author.</note>.</p>
                  <p>To the following foreigners, diſtinguiſhed for their literary knowlege, I muſt pay my beſt acknowlegement for variety of moſt uſeful communications: Doctor ANDERS SPARMAN, of <hi>Stockholm;</hi> Doctor CHARLES P. THUNBERG, of <hi>Upſal;</hi> Mr. AND. J. RETZIUS, Profeſſor of Natural Hiſtory at <hi>Lund;</hi> Mr. MARTIN THRANE BRUNNICH, Profeſſor of Natural Hiſtory, and Mr. OTHO MULLER, Author of the <hi>Zoologia Danica,</hi> both of <hi>Copenhagen:</hi> and let me add my great obligations to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors of the Reverend Mr. OTTO FABRICIUS, for his moſt finiſhed <hi>Fauna</hi> of <hi>Greenland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:0591300301:7"/>To many of my countrymen my beſt thanks are due for literary aſſiſtances. Sir JOSEPH BANKS, Baronet, will, I hope, accept my thanks for the free admittance to thoſe parts of his cabinet which more immediately related to the ſubject of the following ſheets.</p>
                  <p>To Sir ASHTON LEVER, Knight, I am highly indebted, for the more intimate and cloſer examination of his treaſures than was allowed to the common viſitors of his moſt magnificent muſeum.</p>
                  <p>To Mr. SAMUEL HEARN, the great explorer by land of the <hi>Icy Sea,</hi> I cannot but ſend my moſt particular thanks, for his liberal communication of many zoological remarks, made by him on the bold and fatiguing adventure he undertook from <hi>Hudſon's Bay</hi> to the <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of the north on that ſide.</p>
                  <p>Mr. ANDREW GRAHAM, long a reſident in <hi>Hudſon's Bay,</hi> obliged me with numbers of obſervations on the country, and the uſe of multitudes of ſpecimens of animals tranſmitted by him to the late muſeum of the Royal Society, at the inſtance of that liberal patron of ſcience, my reſpected friend the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable DAINES BARRINGTON.</p>
                  <p>Let me cloſe the liſt with acknowleging the great aſſiſtance I have found in the Synopſis of Birds by Mr. JOHN LATHAM; a work now brought almoſt to a concluſion, and which contains a far greater number of deſcriptions than any which has gone before. This is owing not only to the aſſiduity of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, but alſo to the peculiar ſpirit of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation, which has, in its voyages to the moſt remote and moſt oppoſite parts of the globe, payed attention to every branch of ſcience. The advantages are pointed out by the able pen of the Reverend Doctor DOUGLAS, in his Introduction to the laſt Voyage of
<pb facs="tcp:0591300301:8"/>
our great navigator, publiſhed (under the auſpices of the Lords of the Admiralty) in a manner which reflects honor on our country in general, and will prove a moſt laſting monument to the memory of the great Officer who ſo unfortunately pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by ſavage hands, and his two able conſorts, who at length ſunk beneath the preſſure of fatigue, in carrying the glory of diſcovery far beyond the attempts of every preceding adventurer.</p>

                  <head>INTRODUCTION. OF THE ARCTIC WORLD.</head>
                  <p>AKNOWLEGE of the geography, climate, and ſoil, and a general view of the productions of the countries, whoſe Zoologic Hiſtory is to be treated of, are points ſo neceſſary, that no apology need be made for introducing them into a prefatory diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>It is worthy human curioſity to trace the gradual increaſe of the animal world, from the ſcanty pittance given to the rocks of <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> to the ſwarms of beings which enliven the vegetating plains of <hi>Senegal:</hi> to point out the cauſes of the local niggardneſs of certain places, and the prodigious plenty in others. The Botaniſt ſhould attend the fancied voyage I am about to take, to explain the ſcanty herbage of the <hi>Arctic</hi> regions; or, ſhould I at any time hereafter deſcend into the lower latitudes, to inveſtigate the luxuriancy of plants in the warmer climates.</p>
                  <p>The Foſſiliſt ſhould join company, and point the variations of primaeval crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the ſolid rock of <hi>Spitzbergen</hi> through all the degrees of terreſtrial matter: the ſteps it makes to perfection, from the vileſt earth to the precious diamond of <hi>Golconda.</hi> The changes in the face of the globe ſhould be attended to; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions by vulcanoes; the ravages of the ſea on ſome coaſts, and the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence it may have made to others, by the retreat of its waters.</p>
                  <p>The purſuit of theſe enquiries will alſo have a farther and more important object. Hiſtory ſhould be called in, and a brief account given of the population of the more remote countries—the motives which induced mankind to ſeek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats in climates ſeemingly deſtitute of incitements to migration. Particular attention ſhould be paid to the means of peopling the new world, and of ſtocking it with animals, to contribute to the ſupport of mankind, after the firſt coloniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—the increaſe of thoſe animals, and their ceſſation, and giving place in a certain latitude to genera entirely different.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="II" facs="tcp:0591300301:12"/>Here the fine ſtudy of Geography ſhould ſtep in to our aſſiſtance. The outline of the terreſtrial globe ſhould be traced; the ſeveral approximations between part and part ſhould be attended to; the nature of the oceans obſerved; the various iſlands pointed out, as the ſteps, the baiting-places where mankind might have reſted in its paſſage from an overcharged continent.</p>
                  <p>The manners of the people ought not leſs to be attended to; and their changes, both mental and corporeal, by compariſon of the preſent ſtate of remote people with nations with whom they had common anceſtors, and who may have been diſcovered ſtill to retain their primaeval ſeats. Some leading cuſtoms may ſtill have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in both; or ſome monuments of antiquity, proofs of congenial habitudes, poſſibly no longer extant in the ſavage than in the cultivated branches of the common ſtock.</p>
                  <p>Let me take my departure northward, from the narrow ſtreights of <hi>Dover,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">STREIGHTS OF DOVES.</note> the ſite of the iſthmus of the once peninſulated <hi>Britain.</hi> No certain cauſe can be given for the mighty convulſion which tore us from the continent: whether it was rent by an earthquake, or whether it was worn through by the continual daſhing of the waters, no <hi>Pythagoras</hi> is left to ſolve the <hi>Fortuna locorum:</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Vidi ego, quod ſuerat quondam ſolidiſſima tellus</l>
                        <l>Eſſe fretum</l>
                     </q>
But it is moſt probable, that the great philoſopher alluded to the partial deſtruction of the <hi>Atlantica inſula,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Plato</hi> as a diſtant tradition in his days<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Plato</hi> died about the year 347 before CHRIST, aged 81. <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> about 497, aged 90.</note>. It was effected by an earthquake and a deluge, which might have rent aſunder the narrow iſthmus in queſtion, and left <hi>Britain,</hi> large as it ſeems at preſent, the mere wreck of its original ſize<note n="†" place="bottom">See this opinion farther diſcuſſed by Mr. <hi>Somner, Ph. Tranſ. Abridg.</hi> iv. 230.</note>. The <hi>Scilly</hi> iſles, the <hi>Hebrides, Orknies, Schet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> and perhaps the <hi>Feroe</hi> iſlands, may poſſibly be no more than fragments of the once far-extended region. I have no quarrel about the word <hi>iſland.</hi> The little iſthmus, compared to the whole, might have been a junction never attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to in the limited navigations of very early times. The peninſula had never been wholly explored, and it paſſed with the antients for a genuine iſland. The correſpondency of ſtrata on part of the oppoſite ſhores of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> leaves no room to doubt but that they were once united.<note place="margin">CHALKY STRATA.</note> The chalky cliffs of <hi>Blanc-nez,</hi> between <hi>Calais</hi> and <hi>Bologne,</hi> and thoſe to the weſtward of <hi>Dover,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly tally: the laſt are vaſt and continued; the former ſhort, and the termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the immenſe bed. Between <hi>Bologne</hi> and <hi>Folkſtone</hi> (about ſix miles from
<pb n="III" facs="tcp:0591300301:13"/>
the latter) is another memorial of the junction of the two countries; a narrow ſubmarine hill, called the <hi>Rip-raps,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">RIP-RAPS.</note> about a quarter of a mile broad, and ten miles long, extending eaſtwards towards the <hi>Goodwin</hi> Sands. Its materials are boulder-ſtones, adventitious to many ſtrata. The depth of water on it, in very low ſpring-tides, is only fourteen feet. The fiſhermen from <hi>Folkſtone</hi> have often touched it with a fifteen feet oar; ſo that it is juſtly the dread of navigators. Many a tall ſhip has periſhed on it, and ſunk inſtantly into twenty-one fathoms water. In <hi>July</hi> 1782, the <hi>Belleiſle</hi> of ſixty-four guns ſtruck, and lay on it during three hours; but, by ſtarting her beer and water, got clear off.</p>
                  <p>Theſe celebrated ſtreights are only twenty-one miles wide in the narroweſt part.<note place="margin">WIDTH OF THE STREIGHTS.</note> From the pier at <hi>Dover</hi> to that at <hi>Calais</hi> is twenty-four. It is conjectured, that their breadth leſſens, and that they are two miles narrower than they were in antient times. An accurate obſerver of fifty years, remarks to me, that the encreaſed height of water, from a decreaſe of breadth, has been apparent even in that ſpace. The depth of the channel, at a medium, in higheſt ſpring-tides, is about twenty-five fathoms. The bottom, either coarſe ſand or rugged ſcars, which have for ages unknown reſiſted the attrition of the currents.<note place="margin">DEPTH.</note> From the ſtreights, both eaſtward and weſtward, is a gradual increaſe of depth thorough the channel to a hundred fathoms, till ſoundings are totally loſt or unattend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to.</p>
                  <p>The ſpring-tides in the ſtreights riſe, on an average, twenty-four feet; the neap-tides fifteen. The tide flows from the <hi>German</hi> ſea, paſſes the ſtreights, and meets, with a great rippling, the weſtern tide from the ocean, between <hi>Fairleigh,</hi> near <hi>Haſtings,</hi> and <hi>Bologne</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">All the intelligence reſpecting the tides, &amp;c. in theſe parts, I received from Mr. <hi>James Hammond</hi> of the cuſtom-houſe, <hi>Dover,</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Cowly,</hi> a veteran pilot of the ſame place.</note>; a proof, that if the ſeparation of the land was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the ſeas, it muſt have been by the overpowering weight of thoſe of the north.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt certain, that <hi>Britain</hi> was peopled from <hi>Gaul.</hi> Similar cuſtoms,<note place="margin">BRITAIN, WHENCE PEOPLED.</note> as far as can be collected, evince this fact. The period is beyond the reach of hiſtory.

If, after the event by which our iſland was torn from the continent, the migra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over ſo narrow a ſtreight might, in the earlier ages, have been very readily effected in the <hi>vitilia navigia</hi> or coracles, or the <hi>monoxyla</hi> or canoes in uſe in the remote periods; but the numerous ſpecies of Quadrupeds never could have ſwam into our iſland, even over ſuch a contracted water, which at all times muſt have been poſſeſſed by tides ſo rapid, as to baffle their utmoſt efforts: their paſſage, therefore, muſt have been over the antient iſthmus; for it is contrary to common ſenſe to ſuppoſe, that our anceſtors would have been at the trouble of tranſporting ſuch gueſts as wolves and bears, and the numerous train of leſſer rapacious ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, even had it been practicable for them to have introduced the domeſtic and uſeful ſpecies.

Boars were common in the neighborhood of <hi>London</hi> in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> II. and continued in our kingdom, in a wild ſtate, till 1577: they were then only to be found in the woods of Lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> who, we are informed by Doctor <hi>Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet,</hi> took great delight in their chace<note n="*" place="bottom">Health's Emprovement.</note>.

We can boaſt of only one hundred and thirty-one kinds of land-birds, and one hundred and twenty-one of water-fowl. <hi>France,</hi> on the contrary, has one hundred and fifty-ſix of the firſt, and one hundred and thirteen of the laſt.

rough ſhore, of little rocks and ſtones. At <hi>Holkham, Wells,</hi> and <hi>Wareham,</hi> the ſandy ſhores terminate in little hillocks of ſand, kept together by the <hi>Arundo Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria,</hi> or <hi>Bent,</hi> the great preſervative againſt the inundations of ſand, which would otherwiſe deſtroy whole tracts of country, and in particular ſoon render uſeleſs the range of ſalt-marſhes which theſe are backed with. <hi>Hunſtanton</hi> cliff riſes a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed feature in this flat tract. The ſurface is the uſual vegetable mould, about a foot deep; beneath that are two feet of ſmall broken pieces of chalk: the ſolid ſtratum of the ſame, after having been loſt for numbers of miles, here again makes its appearance, and forms a ſolid bed thirty feet in thickneſs, reſting on a hard red ſtone four feet deep, which is often ground and made into a red paint. Seven feet of looſe friable dirty yellow ſtone ſucceeds, placed on a baſe of iron-colored plumb-pudding-ſtone, projecting into the ſea, with vaſt fragments ſcattered over the beach. This cliff is about eighty feet high, lies on the entrance of the waſhes, the <hi>Metaris Eſtuarium</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy.</hi> From hence, all the coaſt by <hi>Snettiſham</hi> to <hi>Lynn</hi> is low, flat, and ſhingly.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Holm,</hi> the northern promontory of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the ſea advances deeply weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and forms the great bay called the <hi>Waſhes,</hi> filled with vaſt ſand-banks, the ſummits of which are dry at low water; but the intervening channels are the means of prodigious commerce to <hi>Lynn</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> ſeated on the <hi>Ouze,</hi> which is circulated into the very inland parts of our iſland, through the various rivers which fall into its long courſe. <hi>Lynn</hi> is mentioned in the <hi>Doomſday Book;</hi> but became conſiderable for its commerce with <hi>Norway</hi> as early as the year 1284.</p>
                  <p>The oppoſite ſhore is that of <hi>Lincolnſhire.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">LINCOLNSHIRE.</note> Its great commercial town, <hi>Boſton,</hi> ſtands on the <hi>Witham,</hi> a few miles from the head of the bay. Spring-tides riſe at the quay fourteen feet, and convey there veſſels of above a hundred tons; but greater ſhips lie at the <hi>Scap,</hi> the opening of the eſtuary. Such is the caſe at <hi>Lynn;</hi> for the ſluggiſh rivers of theſe tame tracts want force to form a depth of water.</p>

This very extenſive tract, from the <hi>Scap</hi> to the northern headland oppoſite to <hi>Hull,</hi> preſents to the ſea a bow-like and almoſt unindented front; and ſo low as to be viſible from ſea only at a ſmall diſtance; and churches, inſtead of hills, are the only landmarks to ſeamen. The whole coaſt is fronted with ſalt-marſhes or ſand-hills, and ſecured by artificial banks againſt the fury of the ſea. Old <hi>Holinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> gives a long liſt of ports on this now inhoſpitable coaſt. <hi>Waynfleet,</hi> once a noted haven, is at preſent a mere creek. <hi>Skegneſs,</hi> once a large walled town, with a good harbour, is now an inconſiderable place a mile from the ſea: and the port of

                     <hi>Grimeſby,</hi> which in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> III. furniſhed him with eleven ſhips, is now totally choaked with ſand.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Great Level,</hi> which comprehends <hi>Holland</hi> in this county, with part of <hi>Northamptonſhire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge,</hi> and <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> a tract of ſixty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted miles in length, and forty in breadth, had been originally a wooded country. Whole foreſts of firs and oaks have been found in digging, far beneath the moor, on the ſolid ground; oaks fifteen feet in girth, and ſixteen yards long, moſtly burnt at the bottoms, the antient method of falling them: multitudes of others entirely rooted up, as appears, by the force of the ſea burſting in and overwhelming this whole tract, and covering it with <hi>ſilt,</hi> or the mud which it carried with it from time to time. <hi>Ovid</hi>'s beautiful account of the deluge was here verified; for under <hi>Conington Down,</hi> in <hi>Huntingdonſhire,</hi> was found the ſkeleton of a whale near twenty feet long, which had once ſwam ſecure to this diſtance from its native reſidence.</p>

                  <p>In proceſs of time this tract underwent another revolution.

Thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and indefatigable people firſt taught us the art of embanking, and recovered the valuable lands we now poſſeſs.

Neglect of their labors ſucceeded: the drains were neglected, and the whole became fen and ſhallow lake, reſembling the preſent eaſt fen; the haunt of myriads of water-fowl, or the retreat of banditti. <hi>Ely</hi> and many little tracts which had the advantage of elevation, were at that period literally iſlands.

                  <p>The vaſt fenny tracts of theſe counties were in old times the haunts of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of water-fowl; but the happy change, by attention to draining, has ſubſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their place thouſands of ſheep; or, inſtead of reeds, made thoſe tracts laugh with corn. The Crane, which once abounded in theſe parts, has even deſerted our iſland. The Common Wild Duck ſtill breeds in multitudes in the unreclamed parts; and thouſands are ſent annually to the <hi>London</hi> markets, from the numerous decoys. The Grey Lag Gooſe, <hi>Br. Zool.</hi> ii. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 266, the origin of the Tame, breeds here, and is reſident the whole year: a few others of the Duck kind breed here. Ruffs, Redſhanks, Lapwings, Red-breaſted Godwits, and Whimbrels, are found here during ſummer; but, with their young, in autumn, diſperſe about the iſland. The Short-eared Owl migrates here with the Woodcock, and is a welcome gueſt to the farmer, by clearing the fields of mice.

On attaining the ſummit, he finds himſelf at a diſtance from the ſea, amidſt corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields or verdant paſtures, with a fine view of the country, and a gentleman's ſeat near to the place from which he had emerged. Such may be the amuſement of the curious in ſummer calms! but when the ſtorms are directed from the eaſt, the view from the edge of this hollow is tremendous; for, from the height of above three hundred feet, they may look down on the furious waves, whitened with foam, and ſwelling from their confined paſſage.</p>
                  <p>Peninſulated rocks often jut from the face of the cliff's, precipitous on their ſides, and waſhed by a great depth of water. The iſthmus which joins them to the land, is often ſo extremely narrow as to render it impaſſable for more than two or three perſons a-breaſt; but the tops ſpread into verdant areas, containing veſtiges of rude fortifications, in antient and barbarous times the retreat of the neighboring inhabitants from the rage of a potent invader<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe deſcriptions borrowed from my own <hi>Tours.</hi>

After paſſing the <hi>Spurn-head,</hi> navigators ſteer between the inner and outer <hi>Douſings,</hi> for the <hi>floating light</hi> kept on board a ſmall veſſel (conſtructed for that purpoſe) always anchored at the inner edge of a ſand called <hi>Dogſhon's Shoal,</hi> about eight leagues from the coaſt of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> in about fifteen fathom water.

                  <p>But fortunately, to the north of theſe,<note place="margin">SAND-BANKS.</note> this ſea is much more remarkable for ſand-banks of utility than of danger, and would never have been obſerved but for the multitudes of fiſhes which, at different ſeaſons, according to their ſpecies, reſort to their ſides, from the great northern deeps, either for the ſake of variety of food which they yield, or to depoſe their ſpawn in ſecurity. The firſt to be taken notice of does not come within the deſcription, yet ſhould not be paſſed over in ſilence, as it comes within the natural hiſtory of the <hi>North</hi> ſea.

                  <p>Between theſe and the main land, about two miles from the <hi>Cathneſs</hi> ſhore, lies <hi>Stroma,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">STROMA.</note> the <hi>Ocetis</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> a little iſland, an appertenance to that county, fertile by the manual labor of about thirty families; pleaſant, and lofty enough for the reſort of the Auk tribe. The noted mummies are now loſt, occaſioned by the doors of the caverns in which they were depoſited being broken down, and admiſſion given to cattle, which have trampled them to pieces. This catacomb ſtands on a neck of land bounded by the ſea on three ſides. The ſalt air and ſpray expels all inſects, and is the only preſervation the bodies have; ſome of which had been lodged here a great number of years. In many of the iſles, the inhabitants uſe no other method for preſerving their meat from putrefaction than hanging it in caves of the ſea, and the method is vindicated by the ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>This iſland lies in the <hi>Pentland Firth,</hi> noted for the violence of the tides;<note place="margin">TIDES.</note> tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous to the ſight, but dangerous only when paſſed at improper times. They ſet in from the north-weſt: the flood, on the contrary, on the coaſts of <hi>Lewis,</hi> pours in from the ſouth<note n="†" place="bottom">Mackenſie's Charts of the Orknies, <hi>p. 4, 5.</hi>
                     </note>. The tide of flood upon <hi>Stroma</hi> (and other iſlands ſimilarly ſituated in mid-ſtream) divides or ſplits before it reaches it. A current runs with great violence on both ſides, then unites, at ſome diſtance from the oppoſite end, and forms a ſingle current, running at ſpring-tides at the rate of nine knots an hour; at neap, at that of three only. The ſpace between the dividing tides, at different ends of an iſland, is quite ſtagnant, and is called the eddy. Some of them are a mile or two long, and give room for a ſhip to tack to and fro, till the tides are ſo far ſpent as to permit it to purſue its voyage.</p>
                  <p>The moſt boiſterous parts of the ſtreams are at the extremities of the iſland,<note place="margin">THE SWELCHIE OF STROMA.</note> and a little beyond the top of the eddy, where they unite. The colliſion of theſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſtreams-excite a circular motion, and, when the tide is very ſtrong, occaſion whirlpools in form of an inverted bell, the largeſt diameter of which may be about three feet. In ſpring-tides they have force enough to turn a veſſel round, but not to do any damage: but there have been inſtances of ſmall boats being ſwallowed up. Theſe whirlpools are largeſt when firſt formed; are carried away with the ſtream, and diſappear, but are quickly followed by others. The ſpiral motion or ſuction
<pb n="XXIV" facs="tcp:0591300301:36"/>
does not extend far beyond the cavity: a boat may paſs within twenty yards of theſe whirlpools with ſafety. Fiſhermen who happen to find themſelves within a dangerous diſtance, fling in an oar, or any bulky body, which breaks the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity of the ſurface, and interrupts the vertiginous motion, and forces the water to ruſh ſuddenly in on all ſides and fill up the cavity. In ſtormy weather, the waves themſelves deſtroy this phaenomenon. A ſunk rock near the concourſe of theſe rapid tides occaſions a moſt dreadful appearance. The ſtream meeting with an interruption, falls over with great violence, reaches the bottom, and brings up with it ſand, ſhells, fiſhes, or whatſoever elſe it meets with; which, with boats, or whatſoever it happens to meet, is whirled from the centre of the eruption towards the circumference with amazing velocity, and the troubled ſurface boils and bubbles like a great cauldron, then darts off with a ſucceſſion of whirlpools from ſucceſſive ebullitions. Theſe are called <hi>Rouſts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ROUSTS.</note> and are attended with the utmoſt danger to ſmall boats, which are agitated to ſuch a degree, that (even ſhould they not be overſet) the men are flung out of them, to periſh without any chance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. It is during the ebb that they are tremendous, and moſt ſo in that of a ſpring-tide with a weſt wind, and that in the calmeſt weather; for during flood they are paſſed with the greateſt ſafety. Veſſels in a calm are never in danger of touching on an iſland or viſible rock, when they get into a current, but are always carried ſafe from all danger.</p>

That called <hi>Maviſgrind,</hi> which unites the pariſh of <hi>North Maven,</hi> is only eighty yards broad. But the irregular ſhape of this iſland occaſions it to abound with the fineſt and moſt ſecure ports, called here <hi>voes;</hi> a moſt providential diſpenſation in a ſea which ſwarms with fiſhes of the moſt general uſe. The adjacent iſlands are in general ſo near to the mother iſland, and their headlands point ſo exactly to its correſponding capes, that it is highly probable that they once made a part of the <hi>Mainland.</hi> The rocks and ſtacks aſſume great variety of forms, ſuch as ſteeples and Gothic cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals riſing out of the water, fleets of ſhips, and other fancied ſhapes. The <hi>Dore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,</hi> in the pariſh of <hi>North Maven,</hi> is very ſingular: part is rounded, the reſt ſeems a ruin, compoſed of a ſingle thin fragment of rock, with a magnificent arch within, ſeventy feet in height.</p>
                  <p>To uſe the words of Captain <hi>Thomas Preſton,</hi> to whom we are indebted for an excellent chart of this group, <q>the land is wild, barren, and mountanous; nor is there ſo much as a buſh or a tree to be ſeen. The ſhores are difficult, and in many parts inacceſſible; rude, ſteep, and iron-like; the ſight of which ſtrikes the mind with dread and horror; and ſuch monſtrous precipices and hideous rocks as bring all <hi>Brobdingnag</hi> before your thoughts. Theſe iſlands lie between lat. 60 to 61. In winter the ſun ſets ſoon after it riſes, and in ſummer riſes ſoon after it ſets; ſo that in that ſeaſon the nights are almoſt as light as the day; as on the contrary, in <hi>December</hi> the day is nearly as dark as the night. About the ſolſtice, we ſee every night the <hi>aurora borealis,</hi> or, as they are called by the natives, the <hi>merry dancers,</hi> which ſpread a broad glaring appearance over the whole northern hemiſphere<note n="*" place="bottom">Phil.

                  <p>They are the conſtant attendants of the clear evenings in all theſe northern iſlands, and prove great reliefs amidſt the gloom of the long winter nights.<note place="margin">AURORA BORE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ALIS.</note> They commonly appear at twilight near the horizon, of a dun color, approaching to yellow: ſometimes continuing in that ſtate for ſeveral hours without any ſenſible motion; after which they break out into ſtreams of ſtronger light, ſpreading into columns, and altering ſlowly into ten thouſand different ſhapes, varying their colors from all the tints of yellow to the obſcureſt ruſſet. They often cover the whole hemiſphere, and then make the moſt brilliant appearance. Their motions at theſe times are moſt amazingly quick; and they aſtoniſh the ſpectator with the rapid change of their form. They break out in places where none were ſeen before, ſkimming

briſkly along the heavens: are ſuddenly extinguiſhed, and leave behind an uniform duſky tract. This again is brilliantly illuminated in the ſame manner, and as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly left a dull blank. In certain nights they aſſume the appearance of vaſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, on one ſide of the deepeſt yellow, on the other declining away till it becomes undiſtinguiſhed from the ſky. They have generally a ſtrong tremulous motion from end to end, which continues till the whole vaniſhes. In a word, we, who only ſee the extremities of theſe northern phoenomena, have but a faint idea of their ſplendor, and their motions. According to the ſtate of the atmoſphere they differ in colors. They often put on the color of blood, and make a moſt dreadful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. The ruſtic ſages become prophetic, and terrify the gazing ſpectators with the dread of war, peſtilence, and famine. This ſuperſtition was not peculiar to the northern iſlands; nor are theſe appearances of recent date. The antients called them <hi>Chaſmata,</hi> and <hi>Trabes,</hi> and <hi>Bolides,</hi> according to their forms or colors<note n="*" place="bottom">Ariſtol. Meteorolog. <hi>lib. i. c. 5.</hi> Plin. Nat. Hiſt. <hi>lib. ii. c. 26.</hi>
                     </note>. In old times they were extremely rare, and on that account were the more taken notice of. From the days of <hi>Plutarch</hi> to thoſe of our ſage hiſtorian Sir <hi>Richard Baker,</hi> they were ſuppoſed to have been portentous of great events: and timid imagination ſhaped them into aerial conflicts.

After, I ſuppoſe, a very long intermiſſion, they appeared with great brilliancy in <hi>England,</hi> on <hi>March</hi> 6rh, 1715-16. The philoſophers paid a proper attention<note n="†" place="bottom">See various accounts of them in the <hi>Phil. Tranſ. abr.</hi> iv. part ii. 138.</note>. The vulgar conſidered them as marking the introduction of a foreign race of princes.

                  <p>Multitudes of the inhabitants of each cluſter of iſlands feed, during the ſeaſon,<note place="margin">FOWLING.</note> on the eggs of the birds of the cliffs. The method of taking them is ſo very hazardous, as to ſatisfy one of the extremity to which the poor people are driven for want of food. <hi>Copinſha, Hunda, Hoy, Foula,</hi> and <hi>Noſs head,</hi> are the moſt celebrated rocks; and the neighboring natives the moſt expert climbers and adventurers after the game of the precipice. The height of ſome is above fifty fathoms; their faces roughened with ſhelves or ledges, ſufficient only for the birds to reſt and lay their eggs. To theſe the dauntleſs fowlers will aſcend, paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidly from one to the other, collect the eggs and birds, and deſcend with the ſame indifference. In moſt places, the attempt is made from above: they are lowered from the ſlope contiguous to the brink, by a rope, ſometimes made of ſtraw, ſometimes of the briſtles of the hog: they prefer the laſt, even to ropes of hemp, as it is not liable to be cut by the ſharpneſs of the rocks; the former is apt to untwiſt. They truſt themſelves to a ſingle aſſiſtant, who lets his companion down, and holds the rope, depending on his ſtrength alone; which
<pb n="XXX" facs="tcp:0591300301:43"/>
often fails, and the adventurer is ſure to be daſhed to pieces, or drowned in the ſubjacent ſea. The rope is often ſhifted from place to place, with the impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weight of the fowler and his booty. The perſon above receives ſignals for the purpoſe, his aſſociate being far out of ſight; who, during the operation, by help of a ſtaff, ſprings from the face of the rocks, to avoid injury from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting parts.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Foula,</hi> they will truſt to a ſmall ſtake driven into the ground, or to a ſmall dagger, which the natives uſually carry about them; and which they will ſtick into the ground, and, twiſting round it a fiſhing cord, deſcend by that to climbing places, and, after finiſhing their buſineſs, ſwarm up by it without fear. Few who make a practice of this come to a natural death. They have a common ſaying, <q>Such a one's <hi>Gutcher</hi> went over the <hi>Sneak;</hi> and my father went over the <hi>Sneak</hi> too.</q> It is a pity that the old <hi>Norwegian</hi> law was not here in force. It conſidered this kind of death as a ſpecies of ſuicide.

                  <p>But the moſt ſingular ſpecies of fowling is on the holm of <hi>Noſs,</hi> a vaſt rock ſevered from the iſle of <hi>Noſs</hi> by ſome unknown convulſion, and only about ſixteen fathoms diſtant. It is of the ſame ſtupendous height as the oppoſite precipice<note n="†" place="bottom">480 feet.</note>, with a raging ſea between; ſo that the intervening chaſm is of matchleſs horror. Some adventurous climber has reached the rock in a boat, gained the height, and faſtened ſeveral ſtakes on the ſmall portion of earth which is to be found on the top: correſpondent ſtakes are placed on the edge of the correſpondent cliffs. A rope is fixed to the ſtakes on both ſides, along which a machine, called a cradle, is contrived to ſlide; and, by the help of a ſmall parallel cord faſtened in like manner, the adventurer wafts himſelf over, and returns with his booty, which is the eggs or young of the Black-backed Gull, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 451, and the Herring Gull, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 452.</p>

                  <p>After the expulſion of the <hi>Norwegians,</hi> the coaſts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which they poſſeſſed, were ſtill protected by caſtles; many of which, ſuch as <hi>Oldwick,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit very ſmall improvements on the model left by the antient <hi>Scandinavian</hi> architects: a few deviated from the original manner, were ſquare, had great thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of wall, furniſhed with cells like thoſe in the round towers or <hi>burghs. Borve</hi> caſtle,<note place="margin">BORVE CASTLE.</note> in <hi>Cathneſs,</hi> is a little more advanced. This was the reſidence of <hi>Thorkel,</hi> a famous freebooter in the tenth century. It is a ſmall ſquare building, on a rock projecting into the ſea, adjoined to the main land by an iſthmus not ten feet wide; and beneath the caſtle is a magnificent paſſage for boats, which pierces the rock from ſide to ſide, and is covered by a matchleſs natural arch.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but revert to the former ſubject, to mention the <hi>Snaburgh</hi> in <hi>Tet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> one of the moſt remote of the <hi>Schetland</hi> iſles. It is in the form of a <hi>Roman</hi> camp;<note place="margin">ROMAN CAMP:</note> and when entire, had in the middle a rectangular area ſurrounded by a wall, and that by an earthen rampart of the ſame figure, at ſome diſtance from it. Two ſides of the walled area have the additional defence of another rampart of earth; which commences on the inſide of one of the narrower ſides, and, preſerving the ſame diſtance from the leſſer area as the two other ſides of the outward fence do, terminates at the latter, near an artificial well. That this was <hi>Roman,</hi> I greatly ſuſpect. The care for water was a peculiar object with that wiſe nation; but neglected by barbarians. This is incloſed within the rampart, and at a ſmall diſtance on the outſide, had the protection of a mount, which once probably had its caſtellet, garriſoned for the further ſecurity<note n="†" place="bottom">Vegetius de re Milit. <hi>lib. iv. c. 10.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">CIRCLES.</note> Druidical circles of ſtones, the temples of primaeval religion of our iſland, are not uncommon. The fineſt and moſt entire are thoſe at <hi>Stennis,</hi> in one of the <hi>Orkney</hi> iſles. The diameter of the circle is about a hundred and ten yards. The higheſt ſtone fourteen feet. The whole is ſingularly ſurrounded with a broad and deep ditch, probably to keep at a diſtance the unhallowed vulgar.</p>

                     <note place="margin">SEMICIRCLES.</note>At the ſame place is a noble ſemicircle, conſiſting of four vaſt ſtones entire, and one broken. The higheſt are twenty feet high above ground. Behind them is a mound of earth, conformable to their poſition. If there never was a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſtones to complete a circle, this antiquity was one of the kind which the learned Doctor <hi>Borlaſe</hi> calls a theatre, and ſuppoſes was deſigned for the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of dramatical performances<note n="*" place="bottom">Antiq.

                     </note>. I ſuſpect them to have been either for the purpoſes of religion, or judicial tranſactions; for the age was probably not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently refined for the former amuſements. Upright ſtones, either memorials of the dead,<note place="margin">PLAIN COLUMNS.</note> or victories obtained on the ſpot, are very numerous. The moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable is the ſtone of <hi>Sator,</hi> in the iſle of <hi>Eda.</hi> It is a flag, fifteen feet high, five and a half broad, and only nine inches thick.

The other circle is only twenty-two feet in diameter, and has only two rings, formed of earth:<note place="margin">CIRCULAR.</note> in the centre is a barrow, the ſides of which are fenced with ſtones.

They are too ſhort to receive a body at full length: the ſkeletons found in them lie with the knees preſſed to the breaſt, and the legs doubled along the thighs. A bag, made of ruſhes, has been found at the feet of ſome of theſe ſkeletons, containing the bones, moſt probably, of another of the family. In one were to be ſeen multitudes of ſmall beetles. Whether they were placed there by deſign, or lodged there by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I will not determine; but, as I have diſcovered ſimilar inſects in the bag which incloſed the ſacred <hi>Ibis,</hi> we may ſuppoſe that the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the nation to whom theſe <hi>tumuli</hi> did belong, might have had the ſame ſuperſtition reſpecting them. On ſome of the corpſes interred in this iſland, the mode of burning was obſerved. The aſhes, depoſited in an urn which was covered on the top with a flat ſtone, have been found in the cell of one of the barrows. This coffin or cell was placed on the ground, then covered with a heap of ſtones, and that again caſed with earth and ſods. Both barrow and contents evince them to be of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent age from the former. Theſe tumuli were in the nature of family vaults: in them have been found two tiers of coffins<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Low</hi>'s account, and plate, <hi>Archaeologia,</hi> iii. 276. tab. xiii.</note>. It is probable, that on the death of any one of the family, the tumulus was opened, and the body interred near its kindred bones.</p>

Near them are multitudes of graves, which are diſcoverable only by one, two, three, four, and ſometimes even more ſhort upright ſtones, ſet in the level ſand. The corpſe was interred a few feet deep, and covered with a layer of fine clay, to keep the ſand from touching it.

Not only human bones, but thoſe of oxen, horſes, dogs, and ſheep, have been found in theſe graves.

There are ſeventeen which are habitable, each of which is a lofty mountain ariſing out of the waves, divided from the others by deep and rapid currents. Some of them are deeply indented with ſecure harbours; providence ſeeming to have favored mankind with the ſafeſt retreats in the moſt boiſterous ſeas. All are very ſteep, and moſt of

The ſurface of the mountains con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of a ſhallow ſoil of remarkable fertility; for barley, the only corn ſown here, yields above twenty for one; and the graſs affords abundant paſturage for ſheep.

                     <note place="margin">FOWLING.</note>The manner of fowling is ſo very ſtrange and hazardous that the deſcription ſhould by no means be omitted. Neceſſity compels mankind to wonderful attempts. The cliffs which contain the objects of their ſearch are often two hundred fathoms in height,<note place="margin">FROM ABOVE.</note> and are attempted from above and below. In the firſt caſe, the fowlers provide themſelves with a rope eighty or a hundred fathoms in length. The fowler faſtens one end about his waiſt and between his legs, recommends himſelf to the protection of the Almighty, and is lowered down by ſix others, who place a piece of timber on the margin of the rock, to preſerve the rope from wearing againſt the ſharp edge. They have beſides a ſmall line faſtened to the body of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer, by which he gives ſignals that they may lower or raiſe him, or ſhift him
<pb n="XLI" facs="tcp:0591300301:56"/>
from place to place. The laſt operation is attended with great danger, by the looſening of the ſtones, which often fall on his head, and would infallibly deſtroy him, was it not protected by a ſtrong thick cap; but even that is found unequal to ſave him againſt the weight of the larger fragments of rock. The dexterity of the fowlers is amazing; they will place their feet againſt the front of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, and dart themſelves ſome fathoms from it, with a cool eye ſurvey the places where the birds neſtle, and again ſhoot into their haunts. In ſome places the birds lodge in deep receſſes. The fowler will alight there, diſengage himſelf from the rope, fix it to a ſtone, and at his leiſure collect the booty, faſten it to his girdle, and reſume his pendulous ſeat. At times he will again ſpring from the rock, and in that attitude, with a fowling net placed at the end of a ſtaff, catch the old birds which are flying to and from their retreats.

He, by means of the rope, brings up one of the boats crew; the reſt are drawn up in the ſame manner, and each is furniſhed with his rope and fowling-ſtaff. They then continue their progreſs upwards in the ſame manner, till they arrive at the region of birds; and wander about the face of the cliff in ſearch of them. They then act in pairs; one faſtens himſelf to the end of his aſſociate's rope, and, in places where birds have neſtled beneath his footing, he permits himſelf to be lowered down, depending for his ſecurity to the ſtrength of his companion, who is to haul him up again; but it ſometimes happens that the perſon above is overpowered by the weight, and both inevitably periſh.

                  <p>The ſea which ſurrounds theſe iſlands is extremely turbulent. The tides vary greatly on the weſtern and eaſtern ſides.

ſo as to leave a great temporary chaſm in the ſpot on which it falls, and carries away with it, to an amazing diſtance, any fiſhes which may happen to be within reach of its fury. Thus great ſhoals of Herrings have been found on the higheſt moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Feroe.</hi> It is equally reſiſtleſs on land, tearing up trees, ſtones, and animals, and carrying them to very diſtant places.

                  <p>Among the numerous whirlpools of theſe ſeas, that of <hi>Suderoe,</hi> near the iſland of the ſame name, is the moſt noted. It is occaſioned by a crater, ſixty-one fathoms in depth in the centre, and from fifty to fifty-five on the ſides. The water forms four fierce circumgirations. The point they begin at is on the ſide of a large baſon, where commences a range of rocks running ſpirally, and terminating at the verge of the crater. This range is extremely rugged, and covered with water from the depth of twelve to eight fathoms only. It forms four equidiſtant wreaths, with a channel from thirty-five to twenty fathoms in depth between each. On the outſide, beyond that depth, the ſea ſuddenly ſinks to eighty and ninety. On the ſouth border of the baſon is a lofty rock, called <hi>Sumboe Munk,</hi> noted for the multitude of birds which frequent it. On one ſide, the water is only three or four fathoms deep; on the other fifteen. The danger at moſt times, eſpecially in ſtorms, is very great. Ships are irreſiſtibly drawn in: the rudder loſes its power, and the waves beat as high as the maſts; ſo that an eſcape is almoſt miraculous: yet at the reflux, and in very ſtill weather, the inhabitants will venture in boats, for the ſake of fiſhing. Mr. <hi>Debes</hi> omits the times of greateſt danger.

Here are to be ſought the antient cuſtoms and diet of their original ſtock, which are now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably worn out in the land of their diſtant anceſtors. The luxury of food has ſo little crept in among them, that their meat and drink in general is peculiar to themſelves; and much of the former compoſed of herbs neglected in other places.</p>

Sheep are met with in great flocks in every farm; the wool is manufactured at home, the meat ſalted, and, with the ſkins, much of it is ſold to the Company, at the twenty-two ports al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted for the purpoſes of traffic. It is remarkable, that the climate diſpoſes their horns to grow very large, and even to exceed the number of thoſe of the ſheep of other countries; examples of three, four, and five, being extremely frequent. Goats and ſwine are very ſcarce; the firſt, for want of ſhrubs to brouze, the laſt through deficiency of their uſual food, and the ſupply which the farm-yards of other countries afford.</p>
                  <p>The dogs are ſharp-noſed, have ſhort and ſharp upright ears, buſhy tails, and are full of hair.

<pb n="L" facs="tcp:0591300301:65"/>
berries are but thinly diſperſed, theſe little animals are obliged to croſs rivers to make their diſtant forages. In their return with the booty to their magazines, they are obliged to repaſs the ſtream; of which Mr. <hi>Olaffen</hi> gives the following account:— "The party, which conſiſts of from ſix to ten, ſelect a flat piece of dried cow-dung, on which they place the berries in a heap in the middle; then, by their united force, bring it to the water's edge, and after launching it, embark, and place themſelves round the heap, with their heads joined over it, and their backs to the water, their tails pendent in the ſtream, ſerving the purpoſe of rudders<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Olaffen,</hi> as related to him.</note>."

                     <note place="margin">BEARS.</note>The Polar Bear, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 18, is often tranſported from <hi>Greenland,</hi> on the iſlands of ice; but no ſooner is its landing diſcovered, than a general alarm is ſpread, and purſuit made till it is deſtroyed. The <hi>Icelanders</hi> are very intrepid in their attack on this animal; and a ſingle man, armed only with a ſpear, frequently enters the liſts with this tremendous beaſt, and never fails of victory. A perſon who lived near <hi>Langeneſs,</hi> the extreme northern point, where the Bears moſt frequently land, is ſtill celebrated for having ſlain not fewer than twenty in ſingle combat. There is a reward for every ſkin, which muſt be delivered to the next magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>The Common Bat, p. 185, A. is ſometimes found in this iſland, and finiſhes the liſt of the land-animals of the country.</p>
                  <p>The amphibious quadrupeds, or Seals, are very numerous. <hi>Iceland,</hi> being bleſſed with domeſtic animals, has leſs uſe of this race than other <hi>Arctic</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; yet they are of conſiderable advantage. The ſkins are uſed for cloathing; a good one is equal in value to the ſkin of a ſheep, or the hide of a cow; and the fat ſupplies the lamps in the long nights with oil. The Common, during winter, is exceſſively fat, and will yield ſixty pounds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">SEALS.</note> The <hi>Icelanders</hi> have two ſpecies of native Seals: the Common, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 72, called by them <hi>Land Saelur,</hi> becauſe it keeps near the coaſt; the other, the Great, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 73, or <hi>Ut-Saelur.</hi> They are taken in nets placed in the creeks and narrow bays, which they paſs through to get on ſhore. When it begins to grow dark the hunters make a fire, and fling into it the ſhavings of horns, or any thing that ſmells ſtrong; this allures the Seals, who ſtrike into the nets, and are taken.
<pb n="LI" facs="tcp:0591300301:66"/>
At other times, a <hi>koder</hi> or lure is tied to a rope, and placed before the nets; to which the Seals, ſuppoſing it to be ſome ſtrange animal, will eagerly ſwim, and ſtrike into the nets, paying with their lives for their curioſity. This carries them ſometimes ſo far, that they will ſtray to a conſiderable diſtance inland, attracted by a candle, or the fire in a ſmith's forge. If they are taken young, they are capable of being tamed: they will follow their maſter, and come to him like a dog, when called by the name which is given them. The <hi>Icelanders</hi> have a ſtrange ſuperſtition about theſe animals: they believe they reſemble the human ſpecies more than any other, and that they are the offspring of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt, who were converted into Seals when they were overwhelmed in the <hi>Red Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Other ſpecies of Seals are migratory. Among them is the Harp, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 77, or <hi>Vade-Selur.</hi> Theſe quit the ſeas of <hi>Iceland</hi> in <hi>March,</hi> and ſwim through the ſtreights of <hi>Davies,</hi> by ſome unknown opening, to the fartheſt north; bring forth their young, and return, by the north of <hi>Greenland,</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> extremely lean, to the north of <hi>Iceland;</hi> continue their route, and return to that iſland about <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> chiefly upon the drift-ice, on which they are either ſhot, or harpooned. The Hooded Seal, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 76, or <hi>Bladru</hi> Seal, is rarely taken here. The Walrus, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 71, or <hi>Roſt-unger,</hi> is ſometimes wafted here from <hi>Greenland</hi> on the ice.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be expected,<note place="margin">BIRDS.</note> that many of the feathered tribe ſhould inhabit an iſland ſo very ſevere in its climate, and ſo remote from the more ſouthern continent and iſlands. It is, like all other <hi>Arctic</hi> countries, the aſylum to water-fowl, to breed and educate their young; but, being an inhabited place, fewer reſort here than to the untrodden waſtes of the more diſtant north. The Guland Duck, p. 572. E. may poſſibly be a local bird.

Notwithſtanding they are ſurrounded with a ſwelling ſea, and tremendous breakers, the <hi>Icelanders</hi> venture there annually, in order to collect the eggs, to contribute to the proviſion of the year.

In the days of the geographer <hi>Mela,</hi> there certainly was a ſtrong tide in this upper part of the <hi>Baltic;</hi> for, ſpeaking of the iſlands off <hi>Finland,</hi> he ſays, <q>Quae <hi>Sarmatis</hi> adverſa ſunt, ob alternos acceſſus recurſuſque pelagi, et quod ſpatia queis diſtant, modò operiuntur undis, modò nuda ſunt; aliàs inſulae videntur, aliàs una et continens terra.</q> With propriety, therefore, in another place, does he compare it to a ſtreight, <hi>par freto,</hi> notwithſtanding he was ignorant of its other entrance.<note place="margin">ANTIENT STREIGHTS BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TWEEN</note> Doctor <hi>Pallas</hi> moſt juſtly aſcribes the formation of not only the <hi>Baltic,</hi> but its former communication with the <hi>White Sea,</hi> to the effects of a deluge.

This was the ſtreight through which the tide poured itſelf from the <hi>Hyperborean</hi> ocean, and covered, at its flux, the iſlands deſcribed by <hi>Mela.</hi> This, like the other northern ſeas, was annually frozen over, and could be no obſtacle to the ſtocking of <hi>Scandinavia</hi> with quadrupeds. There is no fixing the period in which this paſſage was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. An influx of ſand, or an earthquake, might cloſe it up.

There are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſoundings from the land to the edge of the ſtream, where the depth is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſeventy fathoms; after that no bottom can be found. The ſoundings off Cape <hi>Cannaveral</hi> are very ſteep and uncertain, as the water ſhallows ſo quick, that from forty fathoms it will immediately leſſen to fifteen, and from that to four, or leſs; ſo that, without great care, a ſhip may be in a few minutes on ſhore. It muſt be obſerved, that, notwithſtanding the gulph-ſtream in general
<pb n="LXX" facs="tcp:0591300301:85"/>
is ſaid to begin where ſoundings end, yet its influence extends ſeveral leagues within the ſoundings; and veſſels often find a conſiderable current ſetting to the northward all along the coaſt, till they get into eight or ten fathom water, even where the ſoundings ſtretch to twenty leagues from the ſhore; but their current is generally augmented or leſſened by the prevaling winds, the force of which, however, can but little affect the grand unfathomable ſtream. From Cape <hi>Cannaveral</hi> to Cape <hi>Hatteras</hi> the ſoundings begin to widen in the extent of their run from the ſhore to the inner edge of the ſtream, the diſtance being generally near twenty leagues, and the ſoundings very regular to about ſeventy fathoms near the edge of the ſtream, where no bottom can be afterwards found. Abreaſt of <hi>Savannah</hi> river, the current ſets nearly north; after which, as if from a bay, it ſtretches north-eaſt to Cape <hi>Hatteras;</hi> and from thence it ſets eaſt-north-eaſt, till it has loſt its force. As Cape <hi>Hatteras</hi> runs a great way into the ſea, the edge of the ſtream is only from five to ſeven leagues diſtant from the cape; and the force and rapidity of the main ſtream has ſuch influence, within that diſtance, over ſhips bound to the ſouthward, that in very high foul winds, or in calms, they have frequently been hurried back to the northward, which has often occaſioned great diſappointment both to merchant ſhips and to men of war, as was often experienced in the late war. In <hi>December</hi> 1754, an exceeding good ſailing ſhip, bound from <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> got abreaſt of Cape <hi>Hatteras</hi> every day during thirteen days, ſometimes even with the tide, and in a middle diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the cape and the inner edge of the ſtream; yet the ſhip was forced back regularly, and could only recover its loſt way with the morning breeze, till the fourteenth day, when a briſk gale helped it to ſtem the current, and get to the ſouthward of the Cape. This ſhews the impoſſibility of any thing which has fallen into the ſtream returning, or ſtopping in its courſe.</p>
                  <p>On the outſide of the ſtream is a ſtrong eddy or contrary current towards the ocean; and on the inſide, next to <hi>America,</hi> a ſtrong tide ſets againſt it. When it ſets off from Cape <hi>Hatteras,</hi> it takes a current nearly north-eaſt; but in its courſe meets a great current that ſets from the north, and probably comes from <hi>Hudſon's Bay,</hi> along the coaſt of <hi>Labrador,</hi> till the iſland of <hi>Newfoundland</hi> divides it; part ſetting along the coaſt through the ſtreights of <hi>Belleiſle,</hi> and ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſt Cape <hi>Breton,</hi> runs obliquely againſt the gulph-ſtream, and gives it a more eaſtern direction: the other part of the northern current is thought to join it on the eaſtern ſide of <hi>Newfoundland.</hi> The influence of theſe joint cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents muſt be far felt; yet poſſibly its force is not ſo great, nor contracted in ſuch a pointed and circumſcribed direction as before they encountered.

                  <p>Theſe Herrings frequent the great ſand-banks, where they depoſit their ſpawn. They are followed by the Spring Herrings, a leſſer fiſh, which approach much nearer to the ſhore; after which arrive the Summer Herring, which almoſt literally fill every creek: the whole fiſhery is of immenſe profit.

                  <p>THE Cod yields another fiſhery of great profit.<note place="margin">COD.</note> They firſt arrive immediately after the earlieſt Herrings, and grow ſo pampered with their fry, that they reject a bait; and are taken in vaſt nets, which are ſet down in fifty or ſeventy fathom water, and taken up every twenty-four hours, with four or five hundred great fiſh entangled in them. As the Herrings retire, the Cod grows hungry; and after that is taken with hook and line, baited with Herring. In more advanced ſeaſon, other varieties of Cod arrive, and are taken, in common with Turbot and other fiſh, with long lines, to which two hundred ſhort lines with hooks are faſtened: the whole is ſunk to the bottom; its place is marked by a buoy faſtened to it by another line of fit length. The extent of the Cod-fiſhery may be judged of on hearing that 40,000 <hi>tonder,</hi> of four buſhels each, of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſalt, are annually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into <hi>Bergen</hi> for that purpoſe only.</p>

                  <p>The ſcene, diveſted of the horror from the eventful expectation of change, was the moſt beautiful and pictureſque:—Two large ſhips becalmed in a vaſt baſon, ſurrounded on all ſides by iſlands of various forms: the weather clear: the ſun gilding the circumambient ice, which was low, ſmooth, and even; covered with ſnow, excepting where the pools of water on part of the ſurface appeared cryſtalline with the young ice<note n="‖" place="bottom">Phips Voy. <hi>tab. iv.</hi>
                     </note>: the ſmall ſpace of ſea they were confined in perfectly ſmooth. After fruitleſs attempts to force a way through the fields of ice, their limits were perpetually contracted by its cloſing; till at length it beſet each veſſel till they became immoveably fixed<note n="§" place="bottom">Same, tab. iii.</note>. The ſmooth extent of ſurface was ſoon loſt: the preſſure of the pieces of ice, by the violence of the ſwell, cauſed them to <hi>pack;</hi> fragment roſe upon fragment, till they were in many places higher than the main-yard. The movements of the ſhips were tremendous and involuntary, in conjunction with the ſurrounding ice, actuated by the currents. The water ſhoal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fourteen fathoms. The grounding of the ice or of the ſhips would have been equally fatal: the force of the ice might have cruſhed them to atoms, or have lifted them out of the water and overſet them, or have left them ſuſpended on the ſummits of the pieces of ice at a tremendous height, expoſed to the fury of the winds, or to the riſque of being daſhed to pieces by the failure of their frozen dock<note n="¶" place="bottom">See theſe diſtreſsful ſituations in tab.

attempt was made to cut a paſſage through the ice; after a perſeverance worthy of <hi>Britons,</hi> it proved fruitleſs. The commander, at all times maſter of himſelf, directed the boats to be made ready to be hauled over the ice, till they arrived at navigable water (a taſk alone of ſeven days) and in them to make their voyage to <hi>England.</hi> The boats were drawn progreſſively three whole days<note n="*" place="bottom">Phips Voy. <hi>tab. v.</hi>
                     </note>. At length a wind ſprung up, the ice ſeparated ſufficiently to yield to the preſſure of the full-ſailed ſhips, which, after laboring againſt the reſiſting fields of ice<note n="†" place="bottom">Same, tab. vi.</note>, arrived on the 10th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the harbor of <hi>Smeeringberg,</hi> at the weſt end of <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and <hi>Hackluyt's Headland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was the hard fortune of Lord <hi>Mulgrave,</hi> at this ſeaſon, to meet with one of thoſe amazing ſhoals of ice which cover, at times, theſe ſeas, for multitudes of leagues. He made the fulleſt trial, from long. 2 to 21 eaſt, and from about lat. 80. 40, as low as about 78. 30, oppoſed by a face of ice without the leaſt opening, and with all the appearance of a ſolid wall. It is well known, that the coaſts of <hi>Sibiria</hi> are, after a northern tempeſt, rendered inacceſſible for a vaſt extent, by the polar ice being ſet in motion. It is as well known, that a ſtrong ſouthern wind will again drive them to their former ſeats, and make the ſhores of the Frozen ocean as clear as the equatorial ſeas. A farther diſcovery on this ſide was denied to the noble navigator. His misfortune will for ever redound to his honor, as it proved his ſpirit, his perſeverance, and a ſoul fertile in expedients among the greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties!</p>
                  <p>That navigators have gone into higher latitudes I cannot deny: the authenticated inſtances only ſhew their accidental good fortune, in having the ice driven towards the pole, and in making a retreat before they were enveloped in the returning ice. The <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> under vice-admiral <hi>Tſhitſhaghef,</hi> within theſe very few years, made an attempt to ſail to the pole by the eaſtern ſide of <hi>Spitzbergen;</hi> but after ſuffering great hardſhips, returned without effecting any diſcovery. Curioſity has been amply ſatisfied: and I believe we may reſt fully content with the common paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to <hi>India,</hi> on the conviction of this tract being totally impracticable.</p>

                     </note>. The approximation of two great fields produces a moſt ſingular phaenomenon; it forces the leſſer (if the term can be applied to pieces of ſeveral acres ſquare) out of the water, and adds them to their ſurface: a ſecond, and often a third ſucceeds; ſo that the whole forms an aggregate of a tremendous height. Theſe float in the ſea like ſo many rugged mountains, and are ſometimes five or ſix hundred yards thick<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ellis's Voy. <hi>127.</hi>
                     </note>; but the far greater part is concealed beneath the water. Theſe are continually encreaſed in height by the freezing of the ſpray of the ſea, or of the melting of the ſnow, which falls on them. Thoſe which remain in this frozen climate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive continual growth; others are gradually wafted by the northern winds into ſouthern latitudes, and melt by degrees, by the heat of the ſun, till they waſte away, or diſappear in the boundleſs element.</p>
                  <p>The colliſion of the great fields of ice, in high latitudes, is often attended with a noiſe that for a time takes away the ſenſe of hearing any thing elſe; and the leſſer with a grinding of unſpeakable horror.</p>
                  <p>The water which daſhes againſt the mountanous ice freezes into an infinite variety of forms; and gives the voyager ideal towns, ſtreets, churches, ſteeples, and every ſhape which imagination can frame<note n="‖" place="bottom">Marten, <hi>37.</hi> Crantz, <hi>i. 31.</hi>

                  <p>I ſhall juſt mention ſome of the attempts made to paſs through the <hi>Icy Sea</hi> to that of <hi>Kamtſchatka.</hi> The firſt was in 1636, from the ſettlement of <hi>Yakutzk.</hi> The rivers from the <hi>Jana</hi> to the <hi>Kolyma</hi> were in conſequence diſcovered. In 1646 a company of <hi>Ruſſian</hi> adventurers, called <hi>Promyſchleni,</hi> or Sable-hunters, made a voyage from the <hi>Kolyma</hi> to the country of the <hi>Tſchutſki,</hi> and traded with thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the teeth of the <hi>Walrus.</hi> A ſecond, but unſucceſsful voyage was made in the next year; but in 1648 one <hi>Deſchnew,</hi> on the 20th of <hi>June,</hi> began his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable voyage, was fortunate in a ſeaſon free from ice, doubled the <hi>Tſchutſki-noſs,</hi> arrived near the river <hi>Olutora,</hi> ſouth of the river <hi>Anadyr,</hi> where he ſuffered ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck,
<pb n="CI" facs="tcp:0591300301:116"/>
but eſcaped to enjoy the honor of his diſcovery. Many other attempts were made, but the moſt which the adventurers have done was to get from the mouth of one great river to another in the courſe of a ſummer. I find very few names, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of rivers, in a tract ſo vaſt as it is, on account of its being ſo little frequented. To the eaſt of the promontory <hi>Taimura,</hi> that of <hi>St. Transfigurationis</hi> bounds the eaſt ſide of the bay of <hi>Chatanga,</hi> in lat. 74. 40, long. from <hi>Ferro</hi> 125. <hi>Swaitoi-noſs,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Cape,</hi> in lat. 73. 15, is a far-projecting headland, and, with the iſles of the <hi>Lena,</hi> and another intervening headland, forms two vaſt bays. Out of the moſt eaſtern, into which the river <hi>Yana</hi> diſcharges itſelf, one <hi>Schalourof,</hi> a broken <hi>Ruſſian</hi> merchant, took his departure for an eaſtern diſcovery. He began his voyage in <hi>July</hi> 1760 from the <hi>Lena,</hi> but was ſo obſtructed with ice that he was forced into the <hi>Yana,</hi> where he was detained the whole winter, by the ſame cauſe, till <hi>July</hi> 29th, 1761. He doubled the <hi>Swaitoi-noſs September</hi> the 6th; according to ſome, ſaw to the north a montanous land, poſſibly an iſland. He was eight days in getting through the paſſage between the continent and the iſle of <hi>St. Diomede,</hi> which lies a little to the ſouth-eaſt of the <hi>Noſs.</hi> He paſſed with a favorable wind the mouths of the <hi>Indigirka</hi> and <hi>Alazeia,</hi> and getting entangled among the ice between the <hi>Medviedkie Oſtrova,</hi> or <hi>Bear Iſlands,</hi> was obliged to lay up his veſſel in one of the mouths of the <hi>Kolyma</hi> during winter, where he ſubſiſted on rein-deer, which frequented thoſe parts in great herds during the ſevere ſeaſon; and on various ſpecies of ſalmon and trout, which were puſhing their way up the river before it was frozen. After this he made two other attempts. In the year 1763 he paſſed the <hi>Peſzcanoi-noſs,</hi> and got into a deep bay, called <hi>Tſchaoûn Skaja Goûba,</hi> with the iſle of <hi>Sabedei</hi> at its mouth; the great <hi>Schalatſkoi-noſs</hi> to the eaſt; and at its bottom the little river <hi>Tſchaoûn,</hi> which diſcharges itſelf here out of the land of the <hi>Tſchutſki,</hi> ſome of whom he ſaw on the ſhore, but they fled on his appearance. He found no means of ſubſiſting in this bay, therefore was obliged to return to the <hi>Lena,</hi> and was greatly aſſiſted in his paſſage by the ſtrength of the current, which uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly ſet from the eaſt. In 1764 he made his laſt attempt, and was, as is conjectured, ſlain by the <hi>Tſchutſki;</hi> but whether he doubled the famous cape of that name, is left uncertain. A MS. map, which Doctor PALLAS favored me with, places the montanous iſle before mentioned in lat. 75, oppoſite to the cape <hi>Schalatſkoi</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">This was ſuppoſed to have been part of the continent of <hi>America;</hi> but in 1768, M. <hi>Tchitſcherin,</hi> governor of <hi>Sibiria,</hi> put the matter out of doubt; for he ſent there three young officers in the winter, on the ice. They found ſome ſmall deſart iſles, without the leſt appearance of land on the north; but on one they met with a ſort of defence, formed of floating wood, on the ſide of a precipice, but by whom formed, or againſt what enemy, is hard to gueſs.

Off <hi>Thaddeus Noſs</hi> appeared, on <hi>June</hi> 29th, abundance of walruſes and great ſeals; and even the wandering <hi>albatroſs</hi> was ſeen in this high latitude<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Voyage</hi> iii. 241.</note>. Between this and the <hi>Penginſk</hi> gulph, at the end of the ſea of <hi>Ochotſk,</hi> is the <hi>iſthmus</hi> which unites the famous peninſula of <hi>Kamtſchatka</hi> to the main land, and is here about a hundred and twenty miles broad, and extends in length from 52 to 61, north lat. The coaſts are often low: often faced with cliffs, in many parts of an extraordinary height; and out at ſea are rude and ſpiring rocks, the haunts of leonine ſeals, whoſe dreadful roarings are frequently the preſervation of mariners, warning them of the danger, in the thick fogs of this climate<note n="‡" place="bottom">Deſcr. Kamtſch. <hi>429.</hi>
                     </note>. The coaſt has but few harbours, notwithſtanding it juts frequently into great headlands. The moſt remarkable are, the <hi>North Head,</hi> with its needle rocks, at the entrance of the bay of <hi>Awatcha (Voyage,</hi> vol. iii. tab. 58); <hi>Cheepoonſkoi Noſs,</hi> ſtill further north, engraven in vol. ii. tab. 84; and <hi>Kronotſkoi Noſs,</hi> with its lofty cliffs. The peninſula widens greatly in the middle, and leſſens almoſt to a point at Cape <hi>Lopatka,</hi> which ſlopes into a low flat, and forms the ſouthern ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the country. The whole is divided lengthways by a chain of lofty rocky mountains, frequently covered with ſnow, and ſhooting into conic ſummits,<note place="margin">VULCANOS.</note> often ſmoking with vulcanic eruptions. They have broken out in numbers of places: the extinct are marked by the craters, or their broken tops. The vulcano near <hi>Awatcha</hi>

ſurprized at the poverty of its <hi>Flora.</hi> It muſt not be ſuppoſed that the ſcanty enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of its plants ariſes from a neglect of ſearch, or the want of a botaniſt to explore its vegetable kingdom. STELLER, a firſt-rate naturaliſt of <hi>Germany,</hi> who attended BERING in his laſt voyage, reſided here a conſiderable time after his eſcape from that unfortunate expedition, expreſsly to complete his remarks in natural hiſtory. The reſult of his botanical reſearches was communicated to Doctor <hi>Gmelin,</hi> another gentleman ſent by the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> government to examine into the natural hiſtory of its dominions. <hi>Europe</hi> has from time to time been ranſacked for men of abilities to perform this meritorious miſſion, and the fruits of their labors have been liberally communicated to a public thirſting for knowlege. The names of MULLER, GMELIN, STELLER, DE L'ISLE, KRASHANINICOFF, GUILDENSTAEDT, LEPECHIN, and PALLAS, will ever be held in reſpect, for adding to the ſtock of natural knowlege. But how much is it to be lamented that <hi>England</hi> wants a patron to encourage the tranſlation of their works, locked up at preſent in <hi>Ruſſian</hi> or <hi>German,</hi> concealed from the generality of readers, to the great ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of knowlege!</p>
                  <p>I here give a liſt of the plants of <hi>Kamtſchatka</hi> in ſyſtematic order; and from it annex an account of the uſes made of them by the natives of the peninſula. I muſt not omit my thanks to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> and the Rev. Mr. <hi>Hugh Davies</hi> of <hi>Beaumaris,</hi> for the great aſſiſtance I received from them. Let me premiſe, that the plants marked <hi>A.</hi> are common to <hi>America</hi> and <hi>Kamtſchatka;</hi> with <hi>B.</hi> to BERING'S Iſle; with <hi>E.</hi> to <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland;</hi> and with <hi>Virg.</hi> thoſe which extend to <hi>Virginia,</hi> or the eaſtern ſide of <hi>North America</hi>

of the <hi>Arctium Lappa,</hi> or common Burdock, which they frequently change till the cure is effected.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Heracleum Panaces,</hi> or <hi>Sweet graſs,</hi> was a plant of the firſt uſe with the <hi>Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatkans,</hi> and formerly made a principal ingredient in all their diſhes; but ſo powerful does the love of hot liquors ſway with the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> that, ſince their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, it is entirely applied to diſtillation. The beginning of <hi>July</hi> the more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent ſtalks and leaves are gathered; after the down is ſcraped off with ſhells, they are layed to ferment; when they grow dry, they are placed in bags, and in a few days are covered with a ſaccharine powder: only a quarter of a pound of powder is collected from a pood, or thirty-ſix pounds of the plant, which taſtes like liquorice. They draw the ſpirit from it by ſteeping bundles of it in hot water; then promote the fermentation in a ſmall veſſel, by adding the berries of the <hi>Lonicera Xyloſteum,</hi> Sp. Pl. i. 248, and <hi>Vaccinium uliginoſum,</hi> 499. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the proceſs by pouring on more water, after drawing off the firſt: they then place the plants and liquor in a copper ſtill, and draw off, in the common manner, a ſpirit equal in ſtrength to brandy<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Voyage,</hi> iii. 337.</note>. Accident diſcovered this liquor. One year, the natives happening to collect a greater quantity of berries of ſeveral kinds, for winter proviſion, than uſual, found in the ſpring that a great quantity had fermented, and become uſeleſs as a food. They reſolved to try them as a drink, and mixed the juice with water. Others determined to experience it pure; and found, on trial, the <hi>Arctic</hi> beatitude, drunkenneſs<note n="†" place="bottom">Gmelin, Fl. Sib. <hi>i. 217.</hi>
                     </note>. The <hi>Ruſſians</hi> caught at the hint, introduced diſtillation, and thus are enabled to enjoy ebriety with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the country.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Moucho-more</hi> of the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> the <hi>Agaricus muſcarius,</hi> Sp. Pl. 1640, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other inſtrument of intoxication. It is a ſpecies of Toadſtool, which the <hi>Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadales</hi> and <hi>Koriaks</hi> ſometimes eat dry, ſometimes immerſed in a fermented liquor made with the <hi>Epilobium,</hi> which they drink notwithſtanding the dreadful effects. They are firſt ſeized with convulſions in all their limbs, then with a raving ſuch as attends a burning fever; a thouſand phantoms, gay or gloomy (according to their conſtitutions) preſent themſelves to their imaginations: ſome dance; others are ſeized with unſpeakable horrors. They perſonify this muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room; and, if its effects urge them to ſuicide, or any dreadful crime, they ſay they obey its commands. To fit themſelves for premeditated aſſaſſinations, they take the <hi>Moucho-more.</hi> Such is the faſcination of drunkenneſs in this country, that nothing can induce the natives to forbear this dreadful potion<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hiſt.

                     <pb n="CXVIII" facs="tcp:0591300301:133"/>As a food, the <hi>Saranne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">SARANNE.</note> or <hi>Lilium Kamtſchatcenſe,</hi> is among the principal. Its roots are gathered by the women in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> dried in the ſun, and layed up for uſe: they are the beſt bread of the country; and after being baked are reduced to powder, and ſerve inſtead of flour in ſoups and ſeveral diſhes. They are ſometimes waſhed, and eaten as potatoes; are extremely nouriſhing, and have a pleaſant bitter taſte. Our navigators boiled and eat them with their meat. The natives often parboil, and beat it up with ſeveral ſorts of berries, ſo as to form of it a very agreeable confection. Providentially it is an univerſal plant here, and all the grounds bloom with its flower during the ſeaſon<note n="*" place="bottom">Deſc. Kamtſch. <hi>363.</hi>
                     </note>. Another happineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked here is, that while fiſh are ſcarce, the <hi>Saranne</hi> is plentiful; and when there is a dearth of this, the rivers pour in their proviſions in redoubled profuſion. It is not to the labors of the females alone that the <hi>Kamtſchatkans</hi> are indebted for theſe roots. The <hi>oeconomic Mouſe,</hi> p. 134. A. ſaves them a great deal of trouble. The <hi>Saranne</hi> forms part of the winter proviſions of that little animal: they not only gather them in the proper ſeaſon, and lay them up in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines, but at times have the inſtinct of bringing them out, in ſunny weather, to dry them, leaſt they ſhould decay<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  <p>Let me add, that STELLER enumerates other ſpecies of the Lilly genus, which I believe are edible. Every ſpecies of fruit, except berries, is denied to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind climate; but the inhabitants uſe various ſorts of them as wholeſome ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, which they eat freſh, or make into palatable jams, or dreſs with their fiſh, either freſh or when preſerved for winter uſe: ſuch are thoſe of the <hi>Lonicera Xylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteum</hi> or <hi>Gimoloſt,</hi> a ſort of Honeyſuckle: the <hi>Rubus Chamaemorus, Morochka,</hi> or Cloudberries: the <hi>Vaccinium Myrtillus, Uliginoſum, Vitis Idaea,</hi> and <hi>Oxycoccos,</hi> or Bilberries, Marſh Bilberries, Red Bilberries, and Cranberries: the <hi>Empetrum Nigrum,</hi> or Heathberries: the <hi>Prunus Padus,</hi> or Bird Cherry: <hi>Crataegus Oxyacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> or White Thorn with red and with black berries: the <hi>Juniperus Communis,</hi> or Common Juniper: and finally, of thoſe of the <hi>Sorbus Aucuparia,</hi> or Common Service.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>Epilobium Latifolium,</hi> Sp. Pl. 494, or <hi>Kipri,</hi> is brewed a common beve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; and, with the aſſiſtance of the Sweet Plant, is made an excellent vinegar: the leaves are uſed as a tea, and the pith is mixed with many of the diſhes, and ſerved up green as a deſert. When the infuſion of it is mixed with the Sweet Herb in the diſtillation, much more brandy is procured than if water alone is uſed<note n="‡" place="bottom">Deſc. Kamtſch. <hi>368.</hi>

The <hi>Solidago Itſchitſchu,</hi> Fl. Sib. ii. 170, is dried and boiled with fiſh; and the broth from it taſtes as if the fleſh of the <hi>Argali</hi> or wild ſheep had been ſeethed in it. The root of <hi>Kotkonnia,</hi> a ſpecies of <hi>Tradeſcantia,</hi> is eaten either freſh, or uſed with the roes of fiſh: the berries have an agreable acidity, like an unripe apple, but will not keep, therefore they muſt be eaten as ſoon as they are gathered. <hi>Allium Urſinum, Tcheremcha,</hi> our Wild Garlic, is very common, and uſeful in medicine as well as food; both <hi>Ruſſians</hi> and natives gather it in great quantities for winter ſervice: they ſteep it in water, then mix it with cabbage, onions, and other ingredients, and form out of them a ragout, which they eat cold. It is alſo the principal remedy for the ſcurvy. As ſoon as this plant appears above the ſnow, they ſeem to put this dreadful diſorder at defiance, and find a cure almoſt in its worſt ſtages. The <hi>Potentilla fruticoſa,</hi> Sp. Pl. i. 709, or Shrubby Cinquefoil, is very efficacious in the dyſentery, or in freſh wounds. The <hi>Dryas pentapetala,</hi> Sp. Pl. i. 717, or <hi>Ichagban,</hi> is employed in ſwellings or pains of the limbs. That dreadful poiſon the <hi>Cicuta viroſa,</hi> Sp. Pl. i. 366, Water Hemlock, the <hi>Omeg,</hi> is applied to uſe, by the bold practitioners of this country, in caſes of pains in the back. They ſweat the patient profuſely, and then rub his back with the plant, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to touch the loins, which, they ſay, would bring on immediate death.</p>
                  <p>The trees of uſe are a dwarf ſpecies of <hi>Pinus Cembra,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">TREES.</note> or Pine with edible kernels; it grows in great quantities on both the mountains and plains, covered with moſs. It never grows upright, but creeps on the ground, and is therefore called by the <hi>Ruſſians, Slanetz.</hi> The natives eat the kernels, with even the cones, which brings on a teneſmus; but the chief uſe of the tree is as a ſovereign medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in the ſcurvy. BERING taught the <hi>Kamtſchatkans</hi> to make a decoction of it: but they have neglected his inſtructions, notwithſtanding they ſaw num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his people reſtored to health in a ſhort time, and ſnatched, as it were, from the jaws of death<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>The <hi>Pinus Larix,</hi> or Larch-tree, grows only on the river of <hi>Kamtſchatka,</hi> and the ſtreams which run into it.

<pb n="CXX" facs="tcp:0591300301:135"/>
Of the <hi>Betula alba,</hi> or Common Birch, a tree ſo uſeful to theſe northern nations, they make their ſledges and canoes; and cut the freſh bark into ſmall ſlices like vermicelli, and eat it with their dried caviar: they alſo tap the trees, and drink the liquor without any preparation. With the bark of the alder they dye their leather; but that, and every tree they have near the coaſt, is ſtunted, ſo that they are obliged to go far inland for timber of proper ſize.</p>
                  <p>I muſt add, as a vegetable of uſe in oeconomics, the <hi>Triticum,</hi> Gm. Sib. i. 119, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 56, which grows in great quantities along the ſhores, which they mow, and work into mats, which ſerve for bed clothes and curtains; into mantles, ſmooth on one ſide, and with a pile on the other, which is water-proof.

It is ſingular, that neither the lakes or rivers have any ſpecies of fiſh but what come from the ſea.

                  <p>The <hi>Ruſſians</hi> ſoon annexed theſe iſlands to their conqueſts.

The others are in the ſame caſe; ſo nothing is more probable than their gradual diminution, and, by conſequence, the more eaſy communication formerly from one continent to the other, before the injuries of time, the effects of vulcanoes, and other cataſtrophes, had inſenſibly diminiſhed the ſize, and perhaps the number of theſe iſles, which form the chain; and had eaten in the coaſts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which every where exhibit traces of the ravages they have undergone<note n="*" place="bottom">I am indebted to Doctor PALLAS for the whole account of this chain of iſlands, except where I make other references.—My extracts are made from a <hi>French</hi> Memoir, drawn up by my learned friend, and communicated to me.</note>.</p>

Mention is made of adventurers who brought from hence to <hi>Kamtſchatka</hi> the ſkins of 1,872 Sea Otters, 940 females, and 715 cubs. Another, on a ſmall adjacent iſle, killed 700 old, and 120 cub Sea Otters, 1,900 blue Foxes, 5,700 black Urſine Seals, and 1,310 of their cubs<note n="*" place="bottom">Coxe's Ruſſ. Diſc.</note>.

By the vaſt ſpace of ſea which Doctor PALLAS allows between the two groups, Captain COOK is fully vindicated for omitting, in his chart, the multitude of iſlands which, in the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> maps, form almoſt a complete chain from BERING'S iſle to <hi>America.</hi> Dr. PALLAS'S information muſt have been of the beſt kind; and he and our illuſtrious navigator coincide in opinion, that they have been needleſsly multiplied, by the miſtake of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> adventurers in the reckoning, or, on ſeeing the ſame iſland in different points of view, putting it down as a new diſcovery, and impoſing on it a new name.

The natives, the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of people, are in a ſtate of paradiſaical nature, or at leſt were ſo before the arrival of the <hi>European</hi> coloniſts among them. The men went nearly naked, without the conſciouſneſs of being ſo. The head is the only part they pay any attention to; and that is ſurrounded with a chaplet of net-work, ornamented with feathers, fruits, or mother of pearl. The women have a neat matted apron falling to their knees: they fling over their ſhoulders the ſkin of ſome beaſt, or of ſome large bird, and wear a head-dreſs like the other ſex. The weapons of the country are bows, arrows, javelins, and bearded darts, calculated either for war or the chace. In the art of navigation, they have not got beyond the bark-log, made of a few bodies of trees bound parallel together; and in theſe they dare the turbulent element. They have no houſes. During ſummer they ſhelter themſelves from the ſun under the ſhade of trees; and during nights ſleep under a roof of branches ſpread over them. In winter they burrow under ground, and lodge as ſimply as the beaſts themſelves: ſuch however was their condition in 1697; I have not been able to learn the effect of <hi>European</hi> refinement on their manners. Numbers of ſettlements have, ſince that time, been formed there, under the auſpices of the Jeſuits. The Order was of late years ſupported by the Marquis <hi>de Valero,</hi> a patriotic and munificent nobleman<note n="‡" place="bottom">This is the nobleman whom the writer of Lord <hi>Anſon</hi>'s Voyage ſtigmatiſes with the epithet of <hi>munificent bigot.</hi> It was not by a reverend author, as is generally ſuppoſed, but by a perſon whoſe principles were unhappily in the extreme of another tincture.—Having from my youth been honored with the friendſhip of the <hi>Anſon</hi> family, I can give a little hiſtory of the compilation of the Voyage:—A Mr. <hi>Paman</hi> firſt undertook the work.

Mr. <hi>Robins</hi> unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately forgot that he was writing in the character of a divine; and it was not thought proper to affront Mr. <hi>Walters,</hi> by omitting his name in the title-page, as he had taken in ſubſcriptions: this, therefore, will account for the conſtant omiſſion of the word <hi>Providence,</hi> in a voyage which abounded with ſuch ſignal deliverances.</note>, who favored their attempts, in order to extend the power and wealth of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>

                     <note place="margin">COOK'S RIVER.</note>The eſtuary of COOK'S river is of great length and extent. The river begins between <hi>Anchor Point</hi> and the oppoſite ſhore, where it is thirty miles wide: the depth very conſiderable, and the ebb very rapid. Far within, the channel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts to four leagues, through which ruſhes a prodigious tide, agitated like breakers againſt rocks. The riſe of the tide in this confined part was twenty-one feet. It was examined ſeventy leagues from the entrance, as far as lat. 61. 30, long. 210, and its boundaries were found to be flat, ſwampy, and poorly wooded, till they reached the foot of the great mountains. Towards the north, it divides into two great branches, or perhaps diſtinct rivers. That to the eaſt is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the name of <hi>Turn-again</hi> river. The firſt is a league wide, and navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable, as far as was tried, for the largeſt ſhips, and continued very brackiſh; there is therefore the greateſt probability of its having a very long courſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in after times, of conſiderable uſe in inland navigation: that it is of ſome even at preſent is very certain; for here, as well as in <hi>Prince William</hi>'s ſound, the <hi>Indians</hi> were poſſeſſed of glaſs beads and great knives of <hi>Engliſh</hi> manufacture, which the <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s bay company annually ſend in great quantities, and exchange for furs with the natives, who travel to our ſettlements very far from the weſt. The company alſo ſend copper and braſs veſſels; but neither copper or iron in bars. There does not ſeem to be any direct dealings with the <hi>Indians</hi> of this coaſt: the traffic is carried on by intermediate tribes, who never think of bringing furs to a people ſo amply ſupplied as the <hi>Indians</hi> are who deal with our factories. Nations who uſe the moſt pretious furs merely as a defence from the cold, make no diſtinction of kinds: if they could get more beads or more knives for the ſkins of Sea Otters
<pb n="CLI" facs="tcp:0591300301:167"/>
than any other, they would inſtantly become articles of commerce, and find their way acroſs the continent to the <hi>European</hi> ſettlements.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Turn-again</hi> river to the neareſt part of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s bay, is fifty-five degrees, or about ſixteen hundred miles; but from the moſt weſtern part of <hi>Arapatheſcow</hi> lake (which is intermediate) is only twenty-ſix degrees, or about ſeven hundred and fifty miles. There is no diſcharge out of that vaſt water but what runs into <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s bay. We have ſome obſcure accounts of rivers <note n="*" place="bottom">Particularly from one <hi>Joſeph de la France,</hi> who in 1739 made a very long journey to the weſt, and was a very obſervant man.

                  <p>The inhabitants of <hi>Cook</hi>'s river differed very little from thoſe of <hi>Prince William</hi>'s found.

                  <p>Among the iſles, thoſe of <hi>Schoumagin</hi> are the moſt important, which received their name from having been the place of interment of one of <hi>Bering</hi>'s crew, the firſt which he loſt in theſe ſeas.

                  <p>From Cape <hi>Darby</hi> the land trends to the weſt, and ends in <hi>Point Rodney;</hi> low land, with high land far beyond, taking a northerly direction inland.

It was ten feet long, twenty inches broad, with a rail on each ſide, and ſhod with bone; all neatly put together, in ſome parts with wooden pins, but moſtly with thongs of whalebone: a proof of the ingenuity of the natives. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was to be drawn with dogs or rein-deer, does not appear; for the iſland was deſerted, and only the remains of a few <hi>jourts</hi> to be ſeen.

The continent oppoſite to it bends towards the eaſt, and forms a ſhallow bay; then ſuddenly runs far into the ſea, and makes the moſt weſtern extremity yet known, and probably the moſt weſtern of all. On it were ſeveral huts; and ſtages of bone, ſuch as had been obſerved in the <hi>Tſchutſki</hi> country.

                  <p>The ſea, from the ſouth of BERING'S ſtreights to the creſcent of iſles between

                     <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> is very ſhallow. It deepens from theſe ſtreights (as the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſeas do from thoſe of <hi>Dover)</hi> till ſoundings are loſt in the Pacific Ocean; but that does not take place but to the ſouth of the iſles. Between them and the ſtreights is an increaſe from twelve to fifty-four fathom, except only off St. <hi>Thaddeus Noſs,</hi> where there is a channel of greater depth. From the vulcanic diſpoſition I am led to believe not only that there was a ſeparation of the continents at the ſtreights of BERING, but that the whole ſpace, from the iſles to that ſmall opening, had once been occupied by land; and that the fury of the watery element, actuated by that of fire, had, in moſt remote times, ſubverted and overwhelmed the tract, and left the iſlands monumental fragments.</p>
                  <p>Whether that great event took place before or after the population of <hi>America,</hi> is as impoſſible, as it is of little moment, for us to know. We are indebted to our navigators for ſettling the long diſpute about the point from which it was effected. They, by their diſcoveries, prove, that in one place the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance between continent and continent is only thirty-nine miles, not (as a celebrated caviliſt <note n="*" place="bottom">

This narrow ſtreight has alſo in the middle two iſlands, which would greatly facilitate the migration of the <hi>Aſiatics</hi> into the New World, ſuppoſing that it took place in canoes, after the convulſion which rent the two continents aſunder. Beſides, it may be added, that theſe ſtreights are, even in the ſummer, often filled with ice; in winter, often frozen: in either caſe mankind might find an eaſy paſſage; in the laſt, the way was extremely ready for quadrupeds to croſs, and ſtock the continent of <hi>America.</hi> I may fairly call in the machinery of vulcanoes to tear away the other means of tranſit farther to the ſouth, and bring in to my aſſiſtance the former ſuppoſition of ſolid land between <hi>Kamtſchatka</hi> and <hi>Oonalaſcha,</hi> inſtead of the creſcent of iſlands, and which, prior to the great cataſtrophe, would have greatly enlarged the means of migration; but the caſe is not of that difficulty to require the ſolution. One means of paſſage is indiſputably eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>But where, from the vaſt expanſe of the north-eaſtern world, to fix on the firſt tribes who contributed to people the new continent, now inhabited almoſt from end to end, is a matter that baffles human reaſon. The learned may make bold and ingenious conjectures, but plain good ſenſe cannot always accede to them. As mankind encreaſed in numbers, they naturally protruded one another forward. Wars might be another cauſe of migrations. I know no reaſon why the <hi>Aſiatic</hi> north might not be an <hi>officina virorum,</hi> as well as the <hi>European.</hi> The overteeming country, to the eaſt of the <hi>Riphaean</hi> mountains, muſt find it neceſſary to diſcharge its inhabitants: the firſt great wave of people was forced forward by the next to

                  <p>The inhabitants of the NEW do not conſiſt of the offspring of a ſingle nation: different people, at ſeveral periods, arrived there; and it is impoſſible to ſay, that any one is now to be found on the original ſpot of its colonization.

All that is advanced in proof is, a quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from one of our poets, which proves no more than that he had diſtinguiſhed himſelf by ſea and land.

But for that, the <hi>Llama</hi> and the <hi>Pacos</hi> might ſtill have inhabited the heights of <hi>Armenia</hi> and ſome more neighboring <hi>Alps,</hi> inſtead of laboring to gain the diſtant <hi>Peruvian Andes;</hi> the whole genus of <hi>Armadillos,</hi> ſlow of foot, would never have abſolutely quitted the torrid zone of the Old World for that of the New; and the whole tribe of Monkies would have gambolled together in the foreſts of <hi>India,</hi> inſtead of dividing their reſidence between the ſhades of <hi>Indoſtan</hi> and the deep foreſts of the <hi>Braſils.</hi> Lions and Tigers might have infeſted the hot parts of the New World, as the firſt do the deſerts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and the laſt the provinces of <hi>Aſia;</hi> or the Pantherine animals of <hi>South America</hi> might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained additional ſcourges with the ſavage beaſts of thoſe antient continents. The Old World would have been overſtocked with animals; the New remained an unanimated waſte! or both have contained an equal portion of every beaſt of the earth. Let it not be objected, that animals bred in a ſouthern climate, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the deſcent of their parents from the ark, would be unable to bear the froſt and ſnow of the rigorous north, before they reached <hi>South America,</hi> the place of their final deſtination. It muſt be conſidered, that the migration muſt have been the work of ages; that in the courſe of their progreſs each generation grew hardened to the climate it had reached; and that after their arrival in <hi>America,</hi> they would again be gradually accuſtomed to warmer and warmer climates, in their removal from north to ſouth, as they had in the reverſe, or from ſouth to north. Part of the Tigers ſtill inhabit the eternal ſnows of <hi>Ararat,</hi> and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the very ſame ſpecies live, but with exalted rage, beneath the Line, in the burning ſoil of <hi>Borneo</hi> or <hi>Sumatra;</hi> but neither Lions or Tigers ever mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated into the New World. A few of the firſt are found in <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> but they are found in numbers only in <hi>Africa.</hi> The Tiger extends as far north as weſtern <hi>Tartary,</hi> in lat. 40. 50, but never has reached <hi>Africa.</hi> I ſhall cloſe this account with obſerving, that it could be from no other part of the globe except <hi>Aſia,</hi> from whence the New World could receive the animal creation.</p>
                  <p>The late voyage of the illuſtrious COOK has reduced the probable conjectures of philoſophers into certainty. He has proved that the limits of the Old and New World approach within thirteen leagues of each other. We know that the intervening ſtreights are frequently frozen up; and we have great reaſon to ſuppoſe, that the two continents might have been once united, even as low as the <hi>Aleutian</hi> iſlands, or lat. 52. 30. Thus are diſcovered two means of paſſage from <hi>Aſia</hi> to <hi>America;</hi> the laſt
<pb n="CLXVII" facs="tcp:0591300301:183"/>
in a climate not more rigorous than that which ſeveral animals might very well endure, and yet afterwards proceed gradually to the extreme of heat.</p>
                  <p>In fact, every other ſyſtem of the population of the New World is now over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. The conjectures of the learned, reſpecting the vicinity of the Old and New, are now, by the diſcoveries of our great navigator, loſt in conviction. The ſtrained ſyſtems of divines, laudably indeed exerted in elucidating SACRED WRIT, appear to have been ill-founded; but, in the place of imaginary hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the real place of migration is uncontrovertibly pointed out. Some (from a paſſage in <hi>Plato</hi>) have extended over the <hi>Atlantic,</hi> from the ſtreights of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> to the coaſt of <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South America,</hi> an iſland equal in ſize to the continents of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> over which had paſſed, as over a bridge, from the latter, men and animals; wool-headed Negroes, and Lions and Tigers<note n="*" place="bottom">Catcott on the Deluge, <hi>edit. 2d. p. 139, 15,</hi> &amp;c.</note>, none of which ever exiſted in the New World. A mighty ſea aroſe, and in one day and night engulphed this ſtupendous tract, and with it every being which had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted its migration into <hi>America.</hi> The whole Negro race, and almoſt every Quadruped, now inhabitants of <hi>Africa,</hi> periſhed in this critical day.

                     <pb n="CLXXV" facs="tcp:0591300301:191"/>Some years ago a very important diſcovery was made,<note place="margin">JOURNEY TO THE ICY SEA.</note> not very remote from the place where Captain COOK was obliged to deſiſt from his northern voyage. Mr. <hi>Samuel Hearne,</hi> in the ſervice of the <hi>Hudſon's Bay</hi> Company, by direction of the governors, began a journey, on <hi>December</hi> 7th 1770, towards the northern li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of <hi>America.</hi> He went attended only by <hi>Indians,</hi> with whom he had been long acquainted. He ſet out from <hi>Prince of Wales</hi> fort, 58. 50, north lat. He for a long ſpace took a north-weſtern courſe, croſſed <hi>Meniſchtic</hi> lake, in lat. 61, a water thirty-five miles in breadth, full of fine iſlands, and joining with the river <hi>Namaſſy.</hi> He paſſed over <hi>Wiethen</hi> and <hi>Caſſed</hi> lakes, and from the laſt kept due weſt. In <hi>April</hi> he reached <hi>Thleweyaza Yeth,</hi> a ſmall lake in long. 19, weſt from <hi>Churchil</hi> fort, lat. 61. 30, near which he made ſome ſtay to build canoes, now requiſite againſt the breaking up of the froſt. From that lake he began a courſe due north, and croſſed a chain of lakes, of which <hi>Titumeg</hi> is one. In lat. 64. he went over <hi>Peſhew</hi> lake; after that, the great lake <hi>Cogeed,</hi> out of which iſſues a river pointing north-eaſt, which is ſuppoſed to fall into <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ffin</hi>'s bay. About the middle of <hi>June</hi> he croſſed the great river <hi>Conge-catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wha-chaga,</hi> in lat. 68. 46; and from <hi>Churchil</hi> river weſt long. 24. 2. About thoſe parts are the <hi>Stoney Mountains,</hi> extending in longitude from 116 to 122 from <hi>London:</hi> craggy, and of a tremendous aſpect. On <hi>July</hi> 7th he arrived at <hi>Buffalo</hi> lake, in lat. 69. 30: here he firſt ſaw the <hi>Muſk Buffalo,</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2. Near the north end is <hi>Grizzle Bear-hill,</hi> in about lat. 70, ſo called from its being the haunt of numbers of thoſe animals. On <hi>July</hi> 13th he reached the banks of <hi>Copper River,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">COPPER RIVER.</note> which runs due north into the <hi>Icy Sea.</hi> About the ſouth end is much wood, and very high hills. Its current is very rapid, and its channel choaked with ſhoals, and croſſed with ſtoney ridges, which form three great cataracts. Its banks are high, the breadth about a hundred and eighty yards; but in ſome places it expands into the form of a lake. In an iſland of the river unfortunately happened to be a ſummer encampment of five tents of <hi>Eſkimaux.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ESKIMAUX.</note> The <hi>Indians</hi> attendant on Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> grew furious at the ſight of them. It is their firm opinion, that theſe ſavages are magicians, and that all the evils they experience reſult from their incantations. Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> in vain ſolicited his <hi>Indians</hi> to forbear injuring theſe poor people. They, with their uſual cowardice, deferred the attack till night, when they ſurpriſed and murdered every one, to the number of between twenty and thirty. A young woman made her eſcape, and embraced Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi>'s feet; but ſhe was purſued by a barbarian, and transfixed to the ground. He obſerved in their tents (which were made of deer-ſkins with the hair on) copper veſſels, and whale-bone, and the ſkins of Seals, wooden troughs, and kettles made of a ſoft ſtone (by his deſcription a <hi>lapis ollaris),</hi> and diſhes and ſpoons formed from
<pb n="CLXXVI" facs="tcp:0591300301:192"/>
the thick horns of the Buffalo. Their arms are ſpears, darts, and bows and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; the laſt pointed with ſtone or copper, but moſt rudely made, for want of proper tools. In their dreſs they much reſemble the <hi>Eſkimaux</hi> of <hi>Hudſon's Bay,</hi> but the tails of their jackets are ſhorter; neither do the women, like them, ſtiffen out the tops of their boots. Their canoes differ in not having long projecting prows, but in other reſpects are of the ſame conſtruction. In moſt circumſtances theſe people reſemble thoſe of the <hi>Bay;</hi> and differ materially only in one, for the men in theſe pull out by the roots all the hair of their heads.—Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> firſt ſaw the ſea on <hi>July</hi> 16, at the diſtance of eight miles. He went to the mouth of the river (in lat. 72; weſt long, from <hi>London</hi> 121) which he found full of ſhoals and falls, and inacceſſible to the tide, which ſeemed to flow twelve or fourteen feet. The ſea was at this time full of ice, and on many pieces he ſaw Seals. The land trended both to the eaſt and to the weſt, and the ſea was full of iſlands. The land about <hi>Copper</hi> river, for the ſpace of nine or ten miles to the ſea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of fine marſhes, filled in many places with tall Willow, but no ſort of berry-bearing ſhrubs. There are no woods within thirty miles of the mouth of <hi>Copper</hi> river; and thoſe which then appear, conſiſt of ill-ſhaped and ſtunted Pines.</p>

                  <p>JOHN DAVIS, a moſt able ſeaman, was the firſt who examined the weſt ſide of <hi>Greenland.</hi> Before his time the eaſtern coaſt was the only part known to <hi>Europeans.</hi> He made there three different voyages, in 1585, 1586, and 1587. After doubling <hi>Cape Farewell,</hi> he ſounded, and could not find bottom with three hundred fathoms of line. North of what he properly called <hi>the Land of Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he arrived in a filthy, black, and ſtagnating water, of the depth of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty fathoms. He found drift-wood in lat. 65, and one entire tree ſixty feet long, with its root; the ſpecies were Fir, Spruce, and Juniper<note n="‡" place="bottom">Davis's Voy. <hi>in</hi> Hackluyt, <hi>iii, 101.</hi>

                  <p>DAVIS got as high as lat. 72, and called the country <hi>London Coaſt.</hi> The ſtreight he paſſed, between the weſt of <hi>Greenland</hi> and the great iſlands, is honored by his name. He ſeems to have been engaged among the great iſlands; for he ſays he ſailed ſixty leagues up a ſound, found the ſea of the ſame color with the main ſea, and ſaw ſeveral Whales. He ſailed through another ſound to the ſouth-weſt, found ninety fathom water at the entrance; but within could not touch ground with three hundred and thirty. He had hopes of having found the long-ſought-for paſſage. The tides roſe ſix or ſeven fathoms; but, as is frequent among iſlands, the flood came from ſuch variety of places, that he could not trace its principal origin<note n="†" place="margin">Hackluyt, <hi>iii. 102.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">BAFFIN'S BAY.</note>At lat. 72. 30, I muſt take as my pilot that great ſeaman <hi>William Baffin,</hi> who gave name to the great bay I now enter on. His firſt voyage was in 1613; his ſecond, in which he made the moſt effectual trial for the north-weſt paſſage, was in 1616. He paſſed through <hi>Davis's Streights.</hi> In lat. 70. 20, on the <hi>London Coaſt,</hi> he found the tides riſe only eight or nine feet. In <hi>Horn Sound,</hi> lat. 73. 45, he met with ſeveral people<note n="‡" place="margin">Same, 846.</note>. To the north of that, in 75. 40, was a large and open bay; <hi>Cape Dudley Digges</hi> forms its northern point; within is <hi>Weſtenholme Sound;</hi> beyond that, <hi>Whale Sound;</hi> and in the extreme north, or bottom of this great bay, is that named by <hi>Baffin</hi> after Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> lying in 78 degrees. In thoſe three ſounds were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Whales; but in the laſt the largeſt in all this bay. It is highly probable, that there are one or more communications from hence to the <hi>Icy Sea,</hi> through which the Whales paſs at certain ſeaſons; and this (if I may collect from their numbers) might be that of their migration ſouthward. The diſtance into the <hi>Icy Sea</hi> can be but very ſmall, but probably blocked up with ice; or if not, from the ſudden ſhifting of the ice in that ſea by the change of wind, the paſſage muſt be attended with too great hazard to be attempted. The ice prevented our great ſeaman from making trial of the tides in this bay, which would have brought the matter to greater certainty. He ſaw multitudes of <hi>Walruſes</hi> and Seals in theſe parts, but no ſigns of inhabitants. From hence the land trended weſterly,
<pb n="CLXXXVII" facs="tcp:0591300301:203"/>
to a ſound he called by the name of <hi>Alderman Jones,</hi> in lat. 76. 40. Here the land ran due ſouth to a great ſound in lat. 74. 20, which he called Sir <hi>James Lancaſter</hi>'s. From this place the land took an eaſtern curvature, to the ſtreights between the continent and <hi>Cumberland</hi> iſland. <hi>Baffin</hi> took his courſe between that iſle and the iſle of <hi>Saint James,</hi> left his name to the ſtreight he paſſed, and arrived ſafe in <hi>Cockin's Sound,</hi> on the coaſt of <hi>Weſt Greenland,</hi> where he found the tide riſe eighteen feet: this, and ſimilar exceſſes, ariſing from the confined ſituation of places<note n="*" place="bottom">For the account of this curious voyage, ſee <hi>Purchas,</hi> iii. from p. 836 to 848.</note>.</p>
                  <p>This is the only voyage ever made into <hi>Baffin's Bay.

                  <p>Before I quit theſe frozen regions, I muſt once more return to <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> to relate, what has but very lately been communicated to me, that the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> have of late attempted to colonize theſe dreadful iſlands. They have, for a few years paſt, ſent parties to continue there the whole year; who have eſtabliſhed ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the iſle of <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> at <hi>Croon Bay, King's Bay, Magdalena Bay, Smee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renburgh,</hi> and <hi>Green Harbour;</hi> where they have built huts, each of which is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied by about two boats crews, or twenty-ſix men. They bring with them ſalted fiſh, rye-flour, and the ſerum or whey of ſour milk. The whey is their chief beverage, and is alſo uſed in baking their bread. Each hut has an oven, which ſerves alſo as a ſtove; and their fuel is wood, which they bring with them from <hi>Archangel.</hi> The huts are above ground, and moſt ſurprizingly warm; placed alſo in ſituations which may guard them as much as poſſible from the keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the northern wind.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Erſkine Tonnach,</hi> ſurgeon of <hi>Dunbar</hi> (who, by the friendſhip of the worthy Mr. <hi>George Paton,</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> favored me with this account) gives me the following particulars from his own knowledge.—"During our ſlay on the iſland, my curioſity prompted me to go on ſhore, that I might ſee the oeconomy of theſe arctic ſettlers; and had an opportunity of ſeeing them dine: and though their fare appeared coarſe, the diſpatch they uſe, ſaid a great deal for their health and

appetite. They boil their fiſh with water and rye-meal: and this conſtitutes their diet during winter. In the ſummer they live chiefly on fowls, or their eggs; but in general they forbear fleſh, as the faſts preſcribed by their religion are ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous. They are dreſſed in the ſkins of the animals they kill, which they uſe with the fur ſide next to their bodies: their bedding is likewiſe compoſed of ſkins, chiefly of thoſe of the Bear or Rein Deer. The ſkin of the Fox is the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable; but theſe are preſerved as articles of commerce in their own country. They catch the Beluga, or white Whale, in nets, being converſant in this ſpecies of fiſhery; but are ignorant of that of the great Whale. They were very ſolicitous to get information on that ſubject; which I endeavoured to inſtruct them in, in return for the information they ſo readily gave me. They are moſt excellent markſmen; but, what is peculiar, in preſenting their piece, they do not raiſe it to their ſhoulder, but place the butt-end between their arm and their ſide, fixing their eye on the object toward which they direct the barrel. I ſaw a Bear receive a conſiderable ſhot: it aſtoniſhed me greatly to ſee the animal apply great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of ſnow to the part (which was bleeding freely) as if conſcious of its ſtyptic powers. It retreated with much ſlowneſs; but at ſhort intervals looked behind, and, with much art, threw abundance of ſnow with its hind-paws into the wound. Few of the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> die from the ſeverity of the cold, but are often froſt-bitten, ſo as to loſe their toes or fingers; for they are ſo hardy as to hunt in all weathers. I naturally aſked them, Had they a ſurgeon? They replied, 'No! no! CHRIST is our doctor!' They quit the iſland in <hi>September,</hi> and are privileged to leave the place by the 22d of that month, whether they are relieved by a freſh party from <hi>Ruſſia</hi> or not."—Let me remark, that the great exerciſe uſed by theſe volunteer adventurers; their quantity of vegetable food; their freſhening their ſalt provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by boiling it in water, and mixing it with flour; their beverage of whey; and their total abſtinence from ſpirituous liquors—are the happy preſervatives from the ſcurvy, which brought all the preceding adventurers, who periſhed, to their miſerable end<note n="*" place="bottom">See this ſubject amply treated by Doctor <hi>Aikin,</hi> in a Treatiſe on the ſucceſs, with reſpect to the health, of ſome attempts to paſs the winter in high northern latitudes.</note>.</p>

The land here grew contracted into a very narrow paſſage. Here the adventurers entered with the cutter, and diſcovered that the end was in a magnificent freſh-water lake, to which was given the name of <hi>Baker</hi>'s. The land was quite level, rich in graſs, and abounding with Deer. They found the end quite innavigable, and to terminate in a ſmall ſtream, with many ſhoals at its mouth, and three falls acroſs it. After finding the water decreaſe to the depth of two feet, they returned fully ſatisfied with their voyage.</p>

                     <hi>Hudſon's Bay</hi> has been ſo frequently deſcribed, that I ſhall only give a general view of it and its adjacent parts. Its entrance from the ocean, after leaving to the north <hi>Cape Farewell</hi> and <hi>Davis's Streights,</hi> is between <hi>Reſolution</hi> iſles on the north, and <hi>Button's</hi> iſles, on the <hi>Labrador</hi> coaſt, to the ſouth, forming the eaſtern extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the ſtreights diſtinguiſhed by the name of its great diſcoverer. The coaſts very high, rocky, and rugged at top; in places precipitous; but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times exhibit large beaches. The iſles of <hi>Saliſbury, Nottingham,</hi> and <hi>Digges,</hi> are alſo very lofty, and naked. The depth of water in the middle of the bay is a hundred and forty fathoms. From <hi>Cape Churchill</hi> to the ſouth end of the bay are regular ſoundings; near the ſhore ſhallow, with muddy or ſandy bottom. To the north of <hi>Churchill,</hi> the ſoundings are irregular, the bottom rocky, and in ſome parts the rocks appear above the ſurface at low water. From <hi>Mooſe</hi> river, or the bottom of the bay, to <hi>Cape Churchill,</hi> the land is flat, marſhy, and wooded with Pines, Birch, Larch, and Willows. From <hi>Cape Churchill</hi> to <hi>Wager's Water</hi> the coaſts are all high and rocky to the very ſea, and woodleſs, except the mouths of <hi>Pockerekeſko,</hi> and <hi>Seal</hi> rivers. The hills on their back are naked, nor are there any trees for a great diſtance inland.</p>
                  <p>The mouths of all the rivers are filled with ſhoals, except that of <hi>Churchill,</hi> in which the largeſt ſhips may lie; but ten miles higher, the channel is obſtructed with ſand-banks; and all the rivers, as far as has been navigated, are full of rapids

and cataracts, from ten to ſixty feet perpendicular. Down theſe rivers the <hi>Indian</hi> traders find a quick paſſage; but their return is a labor of many months.</p>
                  <p>As far inland as the Company have ſettlements, which is ſix hundred miles to the weſt, at a place called <hi>Hudſon Houſe,</hi> lat. 53. long. 106. 27, from <hi>London,</hi> is flat country: nor is it known how far to the eaſtward the great chain, ſeen by our navigators from the <hi>Pacific Ocean,</hi> branches off.</p>

The ice on the rivers is eight feet thick. Port wine freezes into a ſolid maſs; brandy coagulates. The very breath fell on the blankets of the beds in form of a hoar froſt, and the bed-cloaths often were found frozen to the wall<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>The iſle of <hi>Newfoundland</hi> is of a triangular form, and lies between lat. 46. 40, and 51. 30: viſited occaſionally, but not inhabited, by ſavages from the continent.</p>
                  <p>The boaſted mine of this iſland lies on the ſouthern and weſtern ſides, on the great bank, which ſtretches from north-eaſt to ſouth-weſt, about two hundred leagues. The water on the bank is from twenty-two to fifty fathoms; on the outſide from ſixty to eighty; on the leſſer banks much the ſame. A great ſwell and thick fog generally mark the place of the greater. The ſubject of the fiſhery has been often treated of; but the following ſhort though clear account of ſo intereſting a ſubject cannot fail being acceptable to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> reader.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">NEWFOUNDLAND FISHERY.</note>"The boats or ſhallops are forty feet in the keel, rigged with a mainmaſt and foremaſt, and lugſails; furniſhed with four oars, three of which row on one ſide, and the other (which is twice as large) <hi>belays</hi> the other three, by being rowed ſideways over the ſtern, by a man who ſtands up for that purpoſe, with his face towards the rowers, counteracting them, and ſteering at the ſame time as he gives way to the boat.</p>
                  <p>"Each of the men in this boat is furniſhed with two lines, one at each ſide of the boat, each furniſhed with two hooks; ſo here are ſixteen hooks conſtantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; which are thought to make a tolerable good day's work of it, if they bring in from five to ten quintals of fiſh, though they have ſtowage for, and ſometimes bring in thirty. Two hundred quintals is called a ſaving voyage; but not under. The bait is ſmall fiſh of all kinds; Herring, Capelin, Lance, Tom Cod, or young Cod; the firſt of which they ſalt, and keep for ſome time, in caſe of ſcarcity of the reſt; but theſe are not near ſo eagerly taken by the fiſh when ſalted. In caſe ſmall fiſh cannot be got, they uſe ſea-fowl, which are eaſily taken in vaſt numbers, by laying nets over the holes in the rocks where they come to rooſt in the night. If neither ſmall fiſh nor birds are to be got, they are forced to uſe the maws of fiſh they catch, which is the worſt bait of any.</p>
                  <p>"When the fiſh are taken, they are carried to the ſtage, which is built with one end over the water for the conveniency of throwing the offals into the ſea, and
<pb n="CXCVII" facs="tcp:0591300301:213"/>
for their boats being able to come cloſe to diſcharge their fiſh. As ſoon as they come on the ſtage a boy hands them to the header, who ſtands at the ſide of a table next the water end; whoſe buſineſs it is to gut the fiſh and cut off the head, which he does by preſſing the back of the head againſt the ſide of the table, which is made ſharp for that purpoſe; when both head and guts fall through a hole in the floor into the water. He then ſhoves the fiſh to the ſplitter, who ſtands oppoſite to him; his buſineſs is to ſplit the fiſh, beginning at the head, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it down to the tail; at the next cut he takes out the larger part of the back-bone, which falls through the floor into the water. He then ſhoves the fiſh off the table, which drops into a kind of hand-barrow, which, as ſoon as filled, is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off to the ſalt-pile. The header alſo flings the liver into a ſeparate baſket, for the making of train-oil, uſed by the curriers, which bears a higher price than Whale-oil.</p>
                  <p>"In the ſalt pile, the fiſh are ſpread upon one another, with a layer of ſalt between. Thus they remain till they have taken ſalt; and then are carried, and the ſalt is waſhed from them by throwing them off from ſhore in a kind of float called a <hi>Pound.</hi> As ſoon as this is completed, they are carried to the laſt operation, of drying them; which is done on ſtanding flakes made by a ſlight wattle, juſt ſtrong enough to ſupport the men who lay on the fiſh, ſupported by poles, in ſome places as high as twenty feet from the ground: here they are expoſed, with the open ſide to the ſun; and every night, when it is bad weather, piled up five or ſix on a heap, with a large one, his back or ſkinny part uppermoſt, to be a ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the reſt from rain, which hardly damages him through his ſkin, as he reſts ſlanting each way to ſhoot it off. When they are tolerably dry, which in good weather is in a week's time, they are put in round piles of eight or ten quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals each, covering them on the top with bark. In theſe piles they remain three or four days to ſweat; after which they are again ſpread, and when dry put into larger heaps, covered with canvas, and left till they are put on board.</p>
                  <p>"Thus prepared, they are ſent to the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> where they fetch a good price; but are not eſteemed in <hi>England:</hi> for which place another kind of fiſh is prepared, called by them Mud Fiſh; which, inſtead of being ſplit quite open, like their dry fiſh, are only opened down to the navel. They are ſalted, and lie in ſalt, which is waſhed out of them in the ſame manner with the others; but inſtead of being laid out to dry, are barrelled up in a pickle of ſalt boiled in water.</p>
                  <p>"The train-oil is made from the livers: it is called ſo to diſtinguiſh it from Whale or Seal oil, which they call fat oil, and is ſold at a lower price (being only
<pb n="CXCVIII" facs="tcp:0591300301:214"/>
uſed for lighting of lamps) than the train-oil, which is uſed by the curriers. It is thus made:—They take a half tub, and, boring a hole through the bottom, preſs hard down into it a layer of ſpruce boughs; upon which they place the livers; and expoſe the whole apparatus to as ſunny a place as poſſible. As the livers cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the oil runs from them, and, ſtraining itſelf clear through the ſpruce boughs, is caught in a veſſel ſet under the hole in the tub's bottom."</p>

from fifty to ſeventy-two feet high, and with moſt amazing rapidity. Hogs, which feed along the ſhores, are much more ſenſible of its approach than mankind: they are obſerved to liſten, to prick up their ears for ſome time, and then ſuddenly to run off at full ſpeed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">MAGNIFICENT VIEWS.</note>The coaſts are, in general, rude and rocky, with ſome variations; but in many places exhibit moſt pictureſque ſcenery. All the northern ſide is high, red, and rocky. The iſles of <hi>Canſo</hi> are varied with many low white rocks. From them to <hi>Torbay</hi> is a ſeries of lofty coaſt, broken and white. <hi>Beaver Harbour</hi> is guarded by moſt pictureſque rounded iſles. South ſhore of <hi>Chebucto</hi> ſteep: the plaiſter cliffs in <hi>George Bay</hi> are remarkable for their precipitous face and white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Sable</hi> or <hi>Sand Iſland</hi> is diſtinguiſhed (as the name imports) by amazing ſand-hills of a ſugar-loaf form. The iſle of <hi>Great Manan,</hi> on the weſtern ſide of the entrance of the bay of <hi>Fundy,</hi> is very lofty, the ſtrata divided, and the top wooded. <hi>St. Mary's Bay</hi> is nobly bounded by high rocks, cloathed on their ſummits with woods: the entrance into it are the <hi>Grand</hi> and <hi>Petit Paſſage;</hi> the ſides of the laſt are either covered with hanging woods, ſloping to the water-edge, or broke into ſhort precipices. The entrance into the fine harbour of <hi>Annapolis</hi> is moſt auguſt: a narrow gut, bounded by enormous precipices, with lofty hills ſoaring above, the tops of which are even and cloathed with woods. The approach to the baſon of <hi>Minas</hi> is not leſs magnificent. The columnar rocks of <hi>Cape Split</hi> are very ſingular. The iſle of <hi>Haute</hi> is lofty and ſteep on every ſide. The whole neighborhood abounds with views of the moſt ſublime and romantic caſt. This peninſula joins the great continent by a very narrow iſthmus, beyond which we retain a wretched barren remnant of near half of the New World; the ſad reverſe of the ſhort ſpace of twenty years!—My eyes withdraw themſelves from the mortifying ſight. BRITAIN, which ſate (by the wiſdom of one man) as the Queen of Nations, now deplores her folly; and ought to confeſs, that <q>thoſe things which were for her wealth, proved to her an occaſion of falling.</q> She ſunk under the deluſion of proſperity, by falſe ſecurity, and the pride of victories. If ſhe makes a proper uſe of adverſity, ſhe ſtill may riſe into glory and wealth, by honeſt induſtry, and by the repreſſion of rapacity and ſordid ambition.—Once more, gracious Heaven, endeavour to ſave an ungrateful people! once more raiſe up ſome great inſtrument to execute thy mercies!—Pour with full meaſure into our youthful Miniſter the virtues of his father!—Emulate, young Man, his virtues, and then—

                           <p>It is difficult to ſay in what manner theſe animals migrated ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from the old to the new world; it is moſt likely it was from the north of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which in very antient times might have been ſtocked with them to its moſt extreme parts, notwithſtanding they are now extinct. At that period there is a probability that the old and the new continents might have been united in the narrow chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel between <hi>Tchutki noſs</hi> and the oppoſite headlands of <hi>America;</hi>

                           <p>But that they paſſed from <hi>Aſia</hi> to <hi>America</hi> is far the more probable, than that they ſtocked the new world from the ſide of <hi>Europe,</hi> not only on account of the preſent narrowneſs of the ſtreight between the two continents, which gives a greater cauſe to ſuppoſe them to have been once joined; but that we are now arrived at a certainty, that theſe animals in antient days were natives of <hi>Sibiria:</hi> the ſculls, with the horns affixed, of a ſize far ſuperior to any known at this time, have been found foſſil not only on the banks of the <hi>Ilga,</hi> which falls into the <hi>Lena,</hi> but even in thoſe of the <hi>Anadyr,</hi> the moſt eaſtern of the <hi>Sibirian</hi> rivers, and which diſembogues north of <hi>Kamtſchatka</hi> into thoſe ſtreights: ſimilar ſkulls and horns have been diſcovered near <hi>Dirſchau,</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> alſo of a gigantic magnitude; and in my opinion of the ſame ſpecies with the modern Biſons<note n="*" place="bottom">

It has not yet been found to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: notwithſtanding they had the appearance for a time of having loſt their ſavage nature, yet they always grew impatient of reſtraint, and, by reaſon of their great ſtrength, would break down the ſtrongeſt incloſure, and entice the tame cattle into the corn-fields.

                           <p>Theſe were the only animals which had any affinity to the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> cattle on the firſt diſcovery of the new world: before that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, it was in poſſeſſion of neither Horſe nor Aſs, Cow nor Sheep, Hog, Goat, nor yet that faithful animal the Dog. Mankind were here in a ſtate of nature; their own paſſions unſubdued, they never thought of conquering thoſe of the brute creation, and rendering them ſubſervient to their will. The few animals which they had congenerous to thoſe mentioned, might poſſibly by induſtry have been reclamed. This animal might have been brought to all the uſes of the <hi>European</hi> Cow; the <hi>Pecari</hi> might have been ſubſtituted for the Hog; the Fox or Wolf for the Dog: but the natives, living wholly by chaſe, were at war with the animal creation, and neglected the cultivation of any part, except the laſt, which was imperfectly tamed.</p>
                           <p>Such is the caſe even to the preſent hour; for neither the example of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> nor the viſible advantages which reſult from an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to that uſeful animal the Cow, can induce the <hi>Indian</hi> to pay any reſpect to it.

I dare not pronounce that they extend to the continent of <hi>America;</hi> yet I have received from Doctor <hi>Pallas</hi> a fringe of very fine twiſted wool, which had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namented a dreſs from the iſle of <hi>Kadjak;</hi> and I have myſelf another piece from the habit of the <hi>Americans</hi> in latitude 50. The firſt was of a ſnowy whiteneſs, and of unparalleled fineneſs; the other as fine, but of a pale brown color: the firſt appeared to be the wool which grows intermixed with the hairs of the <hi>Argali;</hi> the laſt, that which is found beneath thoſe of the Muſk Ox. Each of theſe animals may exiſt on that ſide of the continent, notwithſtanding they might have not fallen within the reach of the navigators in their ſhort ſtay off the coaſt.</p>

                           <p>Theſe animals are ſhot with guns or with arrows; ſometimes with croſs-bows, which are placed in the paths, and diſcharged by means of a ſtring whenever the <hi>Argali</hi> happens to tread on it. They are often chaſed with dogs, not that they are overtaken by them; but when they are driven to the lofty ſummits, they will often ſtand and look as if it were with contempt on the dogs below, which gives the hunter an opportunity of creeping within reach while they are ſo engaged; for they are the ſhyeſt of animals.</p>

They often have recourſe to water-plants, which they can readily get at by wading. <hi>M.

                           <p>In paſſing through the woods, they raiſe their heads to a horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal poſition, to prevent their horns from being entangled in the branches.</p>

                              <note place="margin">GAIT.</note>They have a ſingular gait: their pace is a ſhambling trot, but they go with great ſwiftneſs. In their common walk they lift their feet very high, and will without any difficulty ſtep over a gate five feet high.</p>
                           <p>They feed principally in the night. If they graze, it is always againſt an aſcent;<note place="margin">RUMINATE.</note> an advantage they uſe for the reaſon above aſſigned. They ruminate like the Ox.</p>
                           <p>They go to rut in autumn; are at that time very furious, ſeeking the female by ſwimming from iſle to iſle.<note place="margin">YOUNG.</note> They bring two young at a birth, in the month of <hi>April,</hi> which follow the dam a whole year. During the ſummer they keep in families. In deep ſnows they col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in numbers in the foreſts of pines, for protection from the incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the weather under the ſhelter of thoſe ever-greens.</p>
                           <p>They are very inoffenſive, except in the rutting-ſeaſon; or except they are wounded, when they will turn on the aſſailant, and attack

                           <p>Their fleſh is extremely ſweet and nouriſhing. The <hi>Indians</hi> ſay,<note place="margin">FLESH.</note> that they can travel three times as far after a meal of Mooſe, as after any other animal food. The tongues are excellent, but the noſe is perfect marrow, and eſteemed the greateſt delicacy in all <hi>Canada.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The ſkin makes excellent buff; is ſtrong, ſoft, and light.<note place="margin">SKIN.</note> The <hi>Indians</hi> dreſs the hide, and, after ſoaking it for ſome time, ſtretch and render it ſupple by a lather of the brains in hot water. They not only make their ſnow-ſhoes of the ſkin, but after a chaſe form the canoes with it: they ſew it neatly together, cover the ſeams with an unctuous earth, and embark in them with their ſpoils to return home<note n="*" place="bottom">La Hontan, <hi>i. 59.</hi>

                           <p>The palmated parts of the horns are farther excavated by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, and converted into ladles, which will hold a pint.<note place="margin">HORNS.</note>

                           <p>It is not ſtrange that ſo uſeful an animal ſhould be a principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of chaſe. The ſavages perform it in different ways. The firſt,<note place="margin">CHASE.</note> and the more ſimple, is before the lakes or rivers are frozen. Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes aſſemble in their canoes, and form with them a vaſt creſcent, each horn touching the ſhore. Another party perform their ſhare of the chaſe among the woods; they ſurround an extenſive tract, let looſe their dogs, and preſs towards the water with loud cries. The animals, alarmed with the noiſe, fly before the hunters, and plunge into the lake, where they are killed by the perſons in the canoes, prepared for their reception, with lances or clubs<note n="†" place="bottom">Charlevoix, <hi>v. 188.</hi>

                           <p>The other method is more artful. The ſavages incloſe a large ſpace with ſtakes hedged with branches of trees, forming two ſides
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0591300301:243"/>
of a triangle: the bottom opens into a ſecond encloſure, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely triangular. At the opening are hung numbers of ſnares, made of ſlips of raw hides. The <hi>Indians,</hi> as before, aſſemble in great troops, and with all kinds of noiſes drive into the firſt encloſure not only the Mooſes, but the other ſpecies of Deer which abound in that country: ſome, in forcing their way into the fartheſt triangle, are caught in the ſnares by the neck or horns; and thoſe which eſcape the ſnares, and paſs the little opening, find their fate from the arrows of the hunters, directed at them from all quarters<note n="*" place="bottom">Charlevoix, <hi>and</hi> La Hontan, <hi>i. 65.</hi>
                              </note>.</p>
                           <p>They are often killed with the gun. When they are firſt unhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, they ſquat with their hind parts and make water, at which inſtant the ſportſman fires; if he miſſes, the Mooſe ſets off in a moſt rapid trot, making, like the Rein-deer, a prodigious rattling with its hoofs, and will run for twenty or thirty miles before it comes to bay or takes the water. But the uſual time for this diverſion is the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The hunters avoid entering on the chaſe till the ſun is ſtrong enough to melt the frozen cruſt with which the ſnow is covered, otherwiſe the animal can run over the firm ſurface: they wait till it becomes ſoft enough to impede the flight of the Mooſe; which ſinks up to the ſhoulders, flounders, and gets on with great difficulty. The ſportſman purſues at his eaſe on his broad rackets, or ſnow-ſhoes, and makes a ready prey of the diſtreſſed animals,

Such ſpots are called <hi>licking-places.</hi> The huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are ſure of finding the game there; for, notwithſtanding they are often diſturbed, the Buffaloes and Deer are ſo paſſionately fond of the ſavory regale, as to bid defiance to all danger, and return in droves to theſe favorite haunts.</p>
                           <p>The ſkins are a great article of commerce, 25,027 being imported from <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>Penſylvania</hi> in the ſale of 1764.</p>
                           <p>The Deer are of the firſt importance to the Savages. The ſkins form the greateſt branch of their traffick, by which they procure from the coloniſts, by way of exchange, many of the articles of life. To all of them it is the principal food throughout the year; for by drying it over a gentle but clear fire, after cutting it into ſmall pieces, it is not only capable of long preſervation, but is very portable in their ſudden excurſions, eſpecially when reduced to powder, which is frequently done.</p>
                           <p>Hunting is more than an amuſement to theſe people. They give themſelves up to it not only for the ſake of ſubſiſtence, but to ſit themſelves for war, by habituating themſelves to fatigue. A good huntſman is an able warrior.

The Savages have their particular hunting countries; but if they invade the limits of thoſe belonging to other nations, feuds enſue, fatal as thoſe between <hi>Percy</hi> and <hi>Douglas</hi> in the famed <hi>Chevy Chace.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>As ſoon as they arrive on the borders of the hunting country, (which they never fail doing to a man, be their reſpective routes ever ſo diſtant or ſo various) the captain of the band delineates on the bark of a tree his own figure, with a Rattleſnake twined round him with diſtended mouth; and in his hand a bloody tomahawk.

                           <p>The chaſe is carried on in different ways. Some ſurpriſe the Deer by uſing the ſtale of the head, horns, and hide, in the manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned: but the general method is performed by the whole body. Several hundreds diſperſe in a line, encompaſſing a vaſt ſpace of country, fire the woods, and drive the animals into ſome ſtrait or peninſula, where they become an eaſy prey. The Deer alone are not the object; Foxes, Raccoons, Bears, and all beaſts of fur, are thought worthy of attention, and articles of commerce with the <hi>Europeans.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The number of Deer deſtroyed in ſome parts of <hi>America</hi> is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; as is pretended, from an abſurd idea which the Savages have, that the more they deſtroy, the more they ſhall find in ſucceeding years. Certain it is that multitudes are deſtroyed; the tongues only preſerved, and the carcaſes left a prey to wild beaſts. But the motive is much more political. The Savages well diſcern, that ſhould they overſtock the market, they would certainly be over-reached by the <hi>European</hi> dealers, who take care never to produce more goods than are barely ſufficient for the demand of the ſeaſon, eſtabliſhing their prices according to the quantity of furs brought by the natives. The hunters live in their quarters with the utmoſt feſtivity, and indulgence
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0591300301:255"/>
in all the luxuries of the country. The chaſe rouzes their appetites; they are perpetually eating, and will even riſe to obey, at midnight, the calls of hunger. Their viands are exquiſite. Veniſon boiled with red peaſe; turkies barbecued and eaten with bears fat; fawns cut out of the does belly, and boiled in the native bag; fiſh, and crayfiſh, taken in the next ſtream; dried peaches, and other fruits, form the chief of their good living<note n="*" place="bottom">Lawſon, <hi>207.</hi>

                              <p>The Savages who trade to <hi>Hudſon's Bay</hi> make uſe of the wolfiſh kind to draw their furs.</p>
                              <p>It is ſingular, that the race of <hi>European</hi> Dogs ſhew as ſtrong an antipathy to this <hi>American</hi> ſpecies, as they do to the Wolf itſelf. They never meet with them, but they ſhew all poſſible ſigns of diſlike, and will fall on and worry them; while the wolfiſh breed, with every mark of timidity, puts its tail between its legs, and runs from the rage of the others. This averſion to the Wolf is natural to all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Dogs: for it is well known that a whelp, which has never ſeen a wolf, will at firſt ſight tremble, and run to its maſter for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: an old dog will inſtantly attack it.</p>
                              <p>I ſhall conclude this article with an abſtract of a letter from Dr. <hi>Pallas,</hi> dated <hi>October</hi> 5th 1781; in which he gives the following confirmation of the mixed breed of theſe animals and Dogs.</p>
                              <q>I have ſeen at <hi>Moſcow</hi> about twenty ſpurious animals from dogs and black wolves. They are for the moſt part like wolves, except that ſome carry their tails higher, and have a kind of coarſe bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They multiply among themſelves: and ſome of the whelps are greyiſh, ruſty, or even of the whitiſh hue of the Arctic wolves: and one of thoſe I ſaw, in ſhape, tail, and hair, and even in bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo like a cur, that, was it not for his head and ears, his ill-natured look, and fearfulneſs at the approach of man, I ſhould hardly have believed that it was of the ſame breed.</q>

                              <p>CAT.

The deer has no other way of ſaving itſelf, but by plunging into the water, if there happens to be any near; for the Panther, like the Cat, deteſts that element. It will feed even on beaſts of prey.

                              <p>Neceſſity alone ſometimes compels them to attack and feed on the ſwine they meet in the woods: but fleſh is to them an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural diet. They live on berries, fruits, and pulſe of all kinds; are remarkably fond of potatoes, which they very readily dig up with their great paws; make great havock in the fields of maize; and are great lovers of milk and honey. They feed much on herrings, which they catch in the ſeaſon when thoſe fiſh come in ſhoals up the creeks, which gives their fleſh a diſagreeable taſte; and the ſame effect is obſerved when they eat the bitter berries of the <hi>Tupelo.</hi>

                              <p>They are equally inoffenſive to mankind, provided they are not irritated; but if wounded, they will turn on their aſſailant with great fury, and, in caſe they can lay hold, never fail of hugging him to death; for it has been obſerved they never make uſe, in their rage, of either their teeth or claws.

                              <p>The naturaliſt's poet, with great truth and beauty, deſcribes the retreat of this animal in the frozen climate of the north:

                                    <l>And with ſtern patience, ſcorning weak complaint,</l>
                                    <l>Hardens his heart againſt aſſailing want.</l>
                                 </q>
Thoſe of the ſouthern parts dwell in the hollows of antient trees. The hunter diſcovers them by ſtriking with an ax the tree he ſuſpects they are lodged in, then ſuddenly conceals himſelf. The Bear is immediately rouzed, looks out of the hollow to learn the cauſe of the alarm; ſeeing none, ſinks again into repoſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Du Pratz, <hi>ii. 61.</hi>
                                 </note>. The hunter then forces him out, by flinging in fired reeds; and ſhoots him while he deſcends the body of the tree, which, notwithſtanding his aukward appearance, he does with great agility; nor is he leſs nimble in aſcending the tops of the higheſt trees in ſearch of berries and fruits.</p>
                              <p>The long time which theſe animals ſubſiſt without food is amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They will continue in their retreat for ſix weeks without the leſt proviſion, remaining either aſleep or totally inactive. It is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they live by ſucking their paws; but that is a vulgar error. The fact is, they retire immediately after autumn, when they have fattened themſelves to an exceſſive degree by the abundance of the fruits which they find at that ſeaſon. This enables ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which perſpire very little in a ſtate of reſt, to endure an abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of uncommon length. But when this internal ſupport is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and they begin to feel the call of hunger, on the approach of the ſevere ſeaſon, they quit their dens in ſearch of food.

                                 <note place="margin">CHASE.</note>The chaſe of theſe animals is a matter of the firſt importance, and never undertaken without abundance of ceremony. A principal warrior firſt gives a general invitation to all the hunters. This is followed by a moſt ſerious faſt of eight days, a total abſtinence from all kinds of food; notwithſtanding which, they paſs the day in continual ſong. This they do to invoke the ſpirits of the woods to direct them to the place where there are abundance of bears. They even cut the fleſh in divers parts of their bodies, to render the ſpirits more propitious. They alſo addreſs themſelves to the <hi>manes</hi> of the beaſts ſlain in preceding chaſes, as if it were to direct them in their dreams to plenty of game. One dreamer alone cannot determine
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0591300301:285"/>
the place of chaſe, numbers muſt concur; but, as they tell each other their dreams, they never fail to agree: whether that may ariſe from complaiſance, or by a real agreement in the dreams from their thoughts being perpetually turned on the ſame thing.</p>
                              <p>The chief of the hunt now gives a great feaſt, at which no one dares to appear without firſt bathing. At this entertainment they eat with great moderation, contrary to their uſual cuſtom. The maſter of the feaſt alone touches nothing; but is employed in relating to the gueſts antient tales of the wonderful feats in former chaſes: and freſh invocations to the manes of the deceaſed bears conclude the whole. They then ſally forth amidſt the acclamations of the village, equipped as if for war, and painted black. Every able hunter is on a level with a great warrior; but he muſt have killed his dozen great beaſts before his character is eſtabliſhed: after which his alliance is as much courted as that of the moſt valiant captain.</p>
                              <p>They now proceed on their way in a direct line: neither rivers, marſhes, or any other impediments, ſtop their courſe; driving before them all the beaſts which they find in their way. When they arrive in the hunting-ground, they ſurround as large a ſpace as their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany will admit, and then contract their circle; ſearching, as they contract, every hollow tree, and every place fit for the retreat of the bear, and continue the ſame practice till the time of the chaſe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.</p>
                              <p>As ſoon as a bear is killed, a hunter puts into its mouth a lighted pipe of tobacco, and, blowing into it, fills the throat with the ſmoke, conjuring the ſpirit of the animal not to reſent what they are going to do to its body; nor to render their future chaſes unſucceſsful. As the beaſt makes no reply, they cut out the ſtring of the tongue, and throw it into the fire: if it crackles and runs in (which it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſure to do) they accept it as a good omen; if not, they conſider that the ſpirit of the beaſt is not appeaſed, and that the chaſe of the next year will be unfortunate.</p>
                              <p>The hunters live well during the chaſe, on proviſions which they bring with them. They return, home with great pride and ſelf-ſufficiency;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0591300301:286"/>
for to kill a bear forms the character of a complete man. They again give a great entertainment, and now make a point to leave nothing. The feaſt is dedicated to a certain genius, perhaps that of Gluttony, whoſe reſentment they dread, if they do not eat every morſel, and even ſup up the very melted greaſe in which the meat was dreſſed. They ſometimes eat till they burſt, or bring on themſelves ſome violent diſorders. The firſt courſe is the greateſt bear they have killed, without even taking out the entrails, or taking off the ſkin, contenting themſelves with ſingeing the ſkin, as is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed with hogs<note n="*" place="bottom">

                                 </note>. In <hi>Sibiria</hi> it is taken by making a trap-fall of a great piece of timber, which drops and cruſhes it to death: or by forming a nooſe in a rope faſtened to a great log; the bear runs its head into the nooſe, and, finding itſelf engaged, grows furious, and either falls down ſome precipice and kills itſelf, or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries itſelf to death by its agitations.</p>
                              <p>The killing of a bear in fair battle is reckoned as great a piece of heroiſm by the <hi>Kamtſchatkans</hi> as it is with the <hi>Americans.</hi> The victor makes a feaſt on the occaſion, and feaſts his neighbors with the beaſt; then hangs the head and thighs about his tent by way of trophies.</p>

                              <p>The killing of a Bear was reckoned as great an exploit in <hi>Lapland</hi> as it was in <hi>America,</hi> and the hero was held in the higheſt eſteem by both ſexes; and, by a ſingular cuſtom, was forbid all commerce with his wife for three days. The <hi>Laplanders</hi> bring home the ſlain beaſts in great triumph. They erect a new tent near their former dwelling, but never enter it till they have flung off the dreſs of the chaſe. They continue in it three entire days; and the women keep at home the ſame ſpace. The men dreſs the fleſh of the Bear in the new tent, and make their repaſt, giving part to the females; but take great care never to beſtow on them a bit of the rump. Neither will they deliver to them the meat through the common entrance of the hut, but through a hole in another part. In ſign of victory, the men ſprinkle themſelves with the blood of the beaſt.</p>
                              <p>After they have finiſhed eating the fleſh, they bury the bones with great ſolemnity, and place every bone in its proper place, from a firm perſuaſion that the Bear will be reſtored, and re-animate a new body.</p>

From that time they run into the pouch as an aſylum from danger.

                              <p>WEESEL.

                              <p>This ſpecies varies in the diſpoſition of the ſtripes, and I ſuſpect the male is entirely black, as deſcribed by <hi>M. Du Pratz</hi>

It is of an uniform color; but what is a ſtronger proof of their differing only in ſex, is the agreement in number of toes in the fore feet, there being four on each; an exception to the character of this Genus.</p>
                              <p>In ſize it is equal to an <hi>European</hi> Pole-cat, but carries its back more elevated.</p>
                              <p>Theſe animals are found from <hi>Penſylvania</hi> as far as <hi>Louiſiana,</hi> where they are known by the name of the Pole-cat <note n="‡" place="bottom">

                              <p>Nature hath furniſhed this and the following a ſpecies of defence ſuperior to the force either of teeth or claws. The <hi>French</hi> moſt juſtly call theſe animals <hi>enfans du Diable,</hi> or children of the Devil, and <hi>Bêtes puantes,</hi> or the ſtinking beaſts; as the <hi>Swedes</hi> beſtow on them that of <hi>Fiſkatta.</hi> The peſtiferous vapour which it emits from behind, when it is either attacked, purſued, or frightened, is ſo ſuffocating and foetid, as at once to make the boldeſt aſſailant retire with precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0591300301:306"/>
A ſmall ſpace is often no means of ſecurity; the animal either will turn its tail, and by a frequent crepitus prevent all repetition of attempts on its liberty; or elſe ejaculate its ſtiffing urine to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of eighteen feet<note n="*" place="bottom">

Its enemy is ſtupified with the abominable ſtench; or perhaps experiences a temporary blindneſs, ſhould any of the liquid fall on his eyes. No waſhing will free his cloaths from the ſmell: they muſt even be buried in freſh ſoil, in order to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually purified.</p>
                              <p>Perſons who have juſt undergone this misfortune, naturally run to the next houſe to try to free themſelves from it; but the rights of hoſpitality are denied to them: the owner, dreading the infection, is ſure to ſhut the door againſt them.</p>
                              <p>Profeſſor <hi>Kalm</hi> ran the danger of being ſuffocated by the ſtench of one, which was purſued into a houſe where he was.</p>
                              <p>A maid-ſervant, who deſtroyed another in a room where meat was kept, was ſo affected by the vapour as to continue ill for ſeveral days; and the proviſions were ſo infected, that the maſter of the houſe was forced to fling them away<note n="†" place="bottom">The ſame, 277.</note>.</p>
                              <p>Travellers are often obliged, even in the midſt of foreſts, to hold their noſes, to prevent the effects of its ſtench.</p>
                              <p>The brute creation are in like dread of its effluvia. Cattle will roar with agony; and none but true-bred dogs will attack it: even thoſe are often obliged to run their noſes into the ground before they can return to complete its deſtruction. The ſmell of the dogs, after a combat of this nature, remains for ſeveral days intolerable.</p>
                              <p>Notwithſtanding this horrible quality, the fleſh is eaten, and is eſteemed as ſweet as that of a Pig. The bladder muſt be taken out, and the ſkin flayed off, as ſoon as the animal is killed<note n="‡" place="bottom">Lawſon, <hi>119.</hi> Kalm, <hi>i. 278.</hi>

                              <p>I ſhould think it a very diſagreeable companion: yet it is often tamed ſo as to follow its maſter like a Dog; for it never emits its

                              <p>The ſkin is neglected by the <hi>Europeans,</hi> by reaſon of the coarſeneſs of the hair. The <hi>Indians</hi> make uſe of it for tobacco pouches, which they carry before them like the <hi>Highlanders.</hi>

                              <p>It is ſuppoſed that they bring but one at a time. They go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween eight and nine months with young, and ſuckle it almoſt the whole year. The young never quits its dam till it takes a mate. They are monogamous, and very conſtant.</p>
                              <p>They bring forth on land: often carry the young between their teeth, fondle them, and frequently fling them up and catch them again in their paws. Before the young can ſwim, the old ones will take them in their fore feet, and ſwim about upon their backs.</p>
                              <p>They run very ſwiftly: ſwim ſometimes on their ſides, on their backs, and often in a perpendicular direction. They are very ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, embrace each other, and kiſs.</p>

                              <p>They are fond of thoſe parts of the ſea which abound moſt with weeds, where they feed on fiſh, ſepiae, lobſters, and ſhell-fiſh, which they comminute with their flat grinders.</p>

                              <p>Thirdly, they are purſued by two boats till they are tired, for they cannot endure to be long at a time under water.</p>

A fifth party is buſied in collecting twigs to wattle the piles.

                              <p>Beavers have in <hi>America</hi> variety of lakes and waters in which they might fix their ſeats; but their ſagacity informs them of the preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tenure of ſuch dwellings, which are liable to be overthrown by every flood. This induces them to undertake their mighty and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous labors. They therefore ſelect places where no ſuch inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences can be felt. They form a dam to ſupport a reſervoir, fed only by a ſmall rill; and provide for the overflow of the waſte water by a ſuitable channel in the middle of their bank.

But theſe methods are uſed only in ſummer, and not much practiſed; for the ſkins in that ſeaſon are far leſs valuable than in the winter. At that time they are taken in nets placed above and below their houſes, acroſs the creeks, on ſtakes. If the water is frozen, the ice is cut from ſhore to ſhore, in order to put down the ſtakes. When the net is ſet, the <hi>Indians</hi> ſend their women to the Beaver-houſes to diſturb the animals; who dart into the water, and are uſually taken in the net, which is inſtantly hauled up; and put down again with all expedition. If the Beaver miſſes the net, it ſometimes returns to its houſe, but oftener into the vaults on the ſides of the banks; but the poor creature ſeldom eſcapes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purſued into all his retreats, the houſes being broke open, and the vaults ſearched by digging along the ſhores.</p>

From its ſcent it is ſtyled the Muſk Rat, and Muſquaſh. The <hi>Hurons</hi> call it <hi>Ondathra;</hi> from which <hi>M. de Buffon</hi> gives it the name of <hi>Ondatra</hi>

                                 </note>. Like the Beaver, it forms its houſe of a round ſhape, covered with a dome, and conſtructed with herbs and reeds cemented with clay. At the bottom and ſides are ſeveral pipes, through which they paſs in ſearch of food; for they do not lay in a ſtock of proviſion, like the former. They alſo form ſubterraneous paſſages, into which they retreat whenever their houſes are attacked.</p>
                              <p>Theſe houſes are only intended for winter habitations; are deſerted, and rebuilt annually. During ſummer, they live in pairs, and bring forth their young from three to ſix at a time. At approach of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they conſtruct their houſes, and retire into them, in order to be protected from the inclemency of the ſeaſon. Several families occupy the ſame dwelling, which is oft-times covered many feet with ſnow and ice; but they creep out and feed on the roots which lie beneath. They are very fond of the <hi>Acorus Verus,</hi> or <hi>Calamus Aromaticus</hi>

This perhaps gives them that ſtrong muſky ſmell theſe animals are ſo remarkable for; which they loſe during winter, probably when this ſpecies of plant is not to be got. They alſo feed on the freſh-water Muſſels. They feed too on fruit; for <hi>Kalm</hi> ſays, that apples are the baits uſed for them in traps. We may add, that in winter they eat the roots of nettles, and in ſummer, ſtrawberries and raſberries<note n="‖" place="bottom">Charlevoix, <hi>v. 158.</hi>

Theſe, and the other ſpecies of Squirrels, are the greateſt peſts to the farmers of <hi>North America.</hi> They ſwarm in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the provinces, and often deſcend in troops from the back ſettlements, and join the reſt in their ravages on the plantations of mayz, and the various nuts and maſt which that fertile country produces.</p>
                              <p>Thoſe which migrate from the mountains generally arrive in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn; inſtantly clear the ground of the fallen acorns, nuts, and maſt, and form with them magazines for their winter proviſions, in holes which they dig under ground for that purpoſe. They are often robbed of their hoards; for the coloniſts take great pains to find them out; and oft-times the hogs, which rove about the woods, root up and devour their magazines. It is from theſe that they ſupply themſelves, from time to time, with proviſions, quitting their neſts, and returning with a ſufficient ſtock to laſt them for ſome ſpace; it being obſerved, that during winter they do not care to quit their warm retreat, unleſs on a viſit to their ſtorehouſes; therefore, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are obſerved to run about the woods in greater numbers than uſual, it is a certain ſign of the near approach of ſevere cold; for inſtinct directs them to lay in a greater ſtock than uſual, leaſt the inclemency of the weather ſhould deprive them of acceſs to their ſubterraneous magazines.</p>
                              <p>The damage which they do to the poor planters, by deſtroying the mayz, is incredible. They come by hundreds into the fields, climb up the ſtalks, and eat the ſweet corn wrapt up in the heads, and will deſtroy a whole plantation in a night. For this reaſon they were proſcribed. In ſome places the inhabitants were, each, obliged an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to bring in four Squirrels heads. In others, a ſum was given,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0591300301:339"/>
about three pence, for every one that was killed. This proved ſuch an encouragement, as to ſet all the idle people in the province in purſuit of them. <hi>Penſylvania</hi> paid, from <hi>January</hi> 1749 to <hi>January</hi> 1750, 8000l. currency: but on complaint being made by the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that their treaſuries were exhauſted by theſe rewards, they were reduced to one half. How improved muſt the ſtate of the <hi>Americans</hi> then be, in thirty-five years, to wage an expenſive and ſucceſsful war againſt its parent country, which before could not bear the charges of clearing the provinces from the ravages of theſe inſignificant ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals!</p>
                              <p>It has been obſerved, that the Squirrels are greatly multiplied within theſe few years, and that in proportion to the encreaſe of the fields of mayz, which attract them from all parts; I mean not only the grey ſpecies, but all the others.</p>
                              <p>They are eaten by ſome people, and are eſteemed very delicate. Their ſkins, in <hi>America,</hi> are uſed for ladies ſhoes; and are often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into <hi>England,</hi> for lining or facing for cloaks.</p>
                              <p>They make their neſts in hollow trees, with moſs, ſtraw, wool, and other warm materials. They chiefly inhabit trees of the deciduous kind; but ſometimes in pines, whoſe cones are an article of their proviſion. They keep their neſts for ſeveral days together, ſeldom ſtirring out, except for a freſh ſupply of food. Should a deep ſnow prevent them from getting to their ſtorehouſes, multitudes periſh with hunger.</p>
                              <p>When they are ſitting on a bough, and perceive a man, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly move their tails backward and forward, and gnaſh their teeth with a very conſiderable noiſe. This makes them deteſted by the ſportſmen, who loſe their game by the alarm they give. The GREY Squirrel is a difficult animal to kill: it ſits on the higheſt trees, and often between the boughs, and changes its place with ſuch expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the quickeſt markſman can ſcarcely find time to level his piece; and if it can once get into a hole, or into any old neſt, nothing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0591300301:340"/>
can provoke it to get out of its aſylum. They run up and down the bodies of trees, but very rarely leap from one to the other.</p>
                              <p>They are eaſily made tame; will even be brought to play with cats and dogs, which in a ſtate of domeſticity will not hurt them. They will alſo attach themſelves ſo far as to follow children to and from the woods.</p>
                              <p>They agree in their manner of feeding with the <hi>European</hi> kinds; and have all the ſame ſort of attitudes.</p>

When they would leap, they extend the hind legs, and ſtretch

out the intervening ſkin, which producing a larger ſurface, makes the animals ſpecifically lighter than they would otherwiſe be: even with all this advantage, they cannot keep in a ſtrait line, but are urged downward with their weight.

continued through all the Arctic countries, whereſoever wood is found; abounds throughout <hi>Sibiria,</hi> except in the north-eaſt parts, and in <hi>Kamtſchatka,</hi> where it ceaſes, by reaſon of the ceſſation of foreſts.</p>
                              <p>In all theſe countries they are red in ſummer, but at approach of winter change to various and elegant greys. Their furs are of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſoftneſs, and are the ſorts known to us by the name of <hi>Petit Gris.</hi> In the more ſoutherly parts of theſe cold climates, they retain a tinge of the ſummer red, and are leſs valuable. The change of color is effected gradually, as is its return in ſpring to its ferruginous coat.</p>
                              <p>It is very ſingular, that the alteration is not only performed in the ſeverity of the open air, but even in the warmth of a ſtove. Dr. <hi>Pallas</hi> made the experiment on one which was brought to him on the 12th of <hi>September,</hi> and was at that time entirely red. About the 4th of <hi>October</hi> many parts of the body began to grow hoary; and at the time it happened to die, which was on the 4th of <hi>November,</hi> the whole body had attained a grey color, and the legs, and a ſmall part of the face, had alone the reddiſh tinge<note n="*" place="bottom">Nov.

in the day-time. Lives on the buds and catkins of the birch, and on the ſhoots and buds of pines, which give its juices a ſtrong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinous ſmell; and its excrements will burn ſtrongly, with a pitchy ſcent. The laſt are always found at the root of the tree, as if the animal deſcended to eaſe nature. It ſeldom comes out in bad wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but certainly does not remain torpid during winter; for it is often taken in the traps laid for the Grey Squirrels. The ſkins are often put up in the bundles with the latter, ſo that the purchaſer is defrauded, as their fur is of no value. They leap at vaſt diſtances from tree to tree, and never deſcend but for the purpoſe before mentioned. By reaſon of ſimilitude of color between them and the birch bark, they are ſeen with great difficulty, which preſerves them from the attacks of rapacious birds.</p>
                              <p>They bring forth two, three, and rarely four, young at a time. When the parent goes out for food, ſhe laps them carefully up in the moſs. They are very difficult to be preſerved, and ſeldom can be kept alive, by reaſon of want of proper food. They are born blind, and continue ſo fourteen days. The mother pays them great atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; broods over them, and covers them with its flying membrane. The <hi>Ruſſians</hi> call them <hi>Ljetaga,</hi> or the <hi>Flying.</hi>

                              <p>They make their burrows with the greateſt ſkill, immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſurface of the ſoft turfy ſoil. They form a chamber of a flattiſh arched form, of a ſmall height, and about a foot in diameter, to which they ſometimes add as many as thirty ſmall pipes or entrances. Near the chamber they often form other caverns, in which they lodge their winter ſtores: theſe conſiſt of various kinds of plants, even ſome of ſpecies poiſonous to mankind. They gather them in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, harveſt them, and even at times bring them out of the cells to give them a more thorough drying in the ſun. The chief labor reſts on the females. The males, during ſummer, go about ſolitary, and inhabit ſome old neſts; and in that ſeaſon never touch their hoards, but live on berries. They are monogamous, and the male and female at other times found in the ſame neſt. The female brings two or three young at a time, and breeds often in the year.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0591300301:356"/>No little animals are ſo reſpected by the <hi>Kamtſchatkans</hi> as theſe, for to them they owe a delicious food; and with great joy, about autumn, rob the hoards, and leave there many ridiculous preſents by way of amends: they alſo never take the whole of their proviſions, and leave beſides a little dried ovaries of fiſh for their ſupport.</p>
                              <p>But the migrations of theſe Mice, in certain years,<note place="margin">MIGRATIONS.</note> is as extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary a fact as any in natural hiſtory: I will only mention thoſe of <hi>Kamtſchatka.</hi> The cauſe is unknown. Doctor <hi>Pallas</hi> thinks it may ariſe from the ſenſations of internal fire in that vulcanic tract, or a preſcience of ſome unuſual and bad ſeaſon. They gather together in the ſpring in amazing numbers, except the few that are converſant about villages, where they can pick up ſome ſubſiſtance. This makes it probable that the country is over-ſtocked, and they quit it for want of food. The mighty hoſt proceeds in a direct courſe weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and with the utmoſt intrepidity ſwims over rivers, lakes, and even arms of the ſea: many are drowned, many deſtroyed by water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowl, or rapacious fiſh; thoſe which eſcape reſt awhile, to baſk, dry their fur, and refreſh themſelves. If the inhabitants find them in that ſituation, they treat them with the utmoſt tenderneſs, and endeavour to bring them to life and vigor. As ſoon as they have croſſed the river <hi>Penſchim,</hi> at the head of the gulph of the ſame name, they turn ſouthward, and reach the rivers <hi>Judoma</hi> and <hi>Ochot</hi> by the middle of <hi>July.</hi> The ſpace is moſt ſurpriſing, on conſulting the map of the country. The flocks are alſo ſo numerous, that an obſerver has waited two hours to ſee them all paſs. Their return into <hi>Kamtſchatka,</hi> in <hi>October,</hi> is attended with the utmoſt feſtivity and welcome. The natives conſider it as a ſure prognoſtic of a ſucceſsful chaſe and fiſhery: the firſt is certain, as the Mice are always followed by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of beaſts of prey. They equally lament their migration, as the ſeaſon is certainly filled with rains and tempeſts.</p>

finds, that if they even had a ſuperfluity of wood, it would not do, they can uſe nothing but train in them. They alſo mollify their dry food, moſtly fiſh, in the train; and finally, they barter it for all kinds of neceſſaries with the factor. They can few better with fibres of the Seals ſinews than with thread or ſilk. Of the ſkins of the entrails they make their windows, curtains for their tents, ſhirts, and part of the bladders they uſe at their harpoons; and they make train bottles of the maw. Formerly, for want of iron, they made all manner of inſtruments and working-tools of their bones. Neither is the blood waſted, but boiled with other ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, and eaten as ſoup. Of the ſkin of the Seal they ſtand in the greateſt need; for, ſuppoſing the ſkins of Rein-deer and birds would furniſh them with competent cloathing for their bodies, and coverings for their beds; and their fleſh, together with fiſh, with ſufficient food; and provided they could dreſs their meat with wood, and alſo new model their houſe-keeping, ſo as to have light, and keep themſelves warm with it too; yet without the Seals ſkins they would not be in a capacity of acquiring theſe ſame Rein-deer, fowls, fiſhes, and wood; becauſe they muſt cover over with Seal-ſkin both their large and ſmall boats, in which they travel and ſeek their proviſion.

He tries to conceal himſelf behind a wave, and makes haſtily, but ſoftly, up to it, till he comes within four, five, or ſix fathom of it; mean while he takes the utmoſt care that the harpoon, line, and bladder, lie in proper order. Then he takes hold of the oar with his left hand, and the harpoon with his right by the hand-board, and ſo away he throws it at the Seal, in ſuch a manner that the whole dart flies from the hand-board and leaves that in his hand. If the harpoon hits the mark, and buries itſelf deeper than the barbs, it will directly diſengage itſelf from the bone-joint, and that from the ſhaft; and alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind the ſtring from its lodge on the <hi>kajak.</hi> The moment the Seal is pierced, the <hi>Greenlander</hi> muſt throw the bladder, tied to the end of the ſtring, into the water, on the ſame ſide as the Seal runs and dives; for that he does inſtantly, like a dart. Then the <hi>Greenlander</hi> goes and takes up the ſhaft ſwimming on the water, and lays it in its place. The Seal often drags the bladder with it under water, though 'tis a conſiderable impediment, on account of its great bigneſs; but it ſo wearies itſelf out with it, that it muſt come up again in about a quarter of an hour to take breath. The <hi>Greenlander</hi> haſtens to the ſpot where he ſees the bladder riſe up, and ſmites the Seal, as ſoon as it appears, with the great lance deſcribed in the 6th Section<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Sections referred to, and tab. v.</note>. This lance always comes out of its body again; but he throws it at the creature afreſh every time it comes up, till 'tis quite ſpent. Then he runs the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0591300301:375"/>
little lance into it, and kills it outright, but ſtops up the wound directly to preſerve the blood; and laſtly, he blows it up, like a bladder, betwixt ſkin and fleſh, to put it into a better capacity of ſwimming after him; for which purpoſe he faſtens it to the left-ſide of his <hi>kajak,</hi> or boat<note n="*" place="bottom">See vol. i. 150. tab. viii.</note>.</p>
                              <p>In this exerciſe the <hi>Greenlander</hi> is expoſed to the moſt and greateſt danger of his life; which is probably the reaſon that they call this hunt, or fiſhery, <hi>kamavock,</hi> i. e. the Extinction, <hi>viz.</hi> of life. For if the line ſhould entangle itſelf, as it eaſily may, in its ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and violent motion; or if it ſhould catch hold of the <hi>kajak,</hi> or ſhould wind itſelf round the oar, or the hand, or even the neck, as it ſometimes does in windy weather; or if the Seal ſhould turn ſuddenly to the other ſide of the boat; it cannot be otherwiſe than that the <hi>kajak</hi> muſt be overturned by the ſtring, and drawn down under water. On ſuch deſperate occaſions the poor <hi>Greenlander</hi> ſtands in need of all the arts deſcribed in the former Section, to diſentangle himſelf from the ſtring, and to raiſe himſelf up from under the water ſeveral times ſucceſſively; for he will continually be overturning till he has quite diſengaged himſelf from the line. Nay, when he imagines himſelf to be out of all danger, and comes too near the dying Seal, it may ſtill bite him in the face or hand; and a female Seal that has young, inſtead of flying the field, will ſometimes fly at the <hi>Greenlander</hi> in the moſt vehement rage, and do him a miſchief, or bite a hole in his <hi>kajak</hi> that he muſt ſink.</p>
                              <p>In this way, ſingly, they can kill none but the careleſs ſtupid Seal, called <hi>Attarſoak</hi>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0591300301:376"/>
leagues long, but very narrow. There the <hi>Greenlanders</hi> cut off their retreat, and frighten them under water by ſhouting, clapping, and throwing ſtones; but, as they muſt come up again continually to draw breath, then they perſecute them again till they are tired, and at laſt are obliged to ſtay ſo long above water, that they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round them, and kill them with the fourth kind of dart, deſcribed in the 6th Section. During this hunt we have a fine opportunity to ſee the agility of the <hi>Greenlanders,</hi> or, if I may call it ſo, their huſſar-like manoeuvres. When the Seal riſes out of the water, they all fly upon it, as if they had wings, with a deſperate noiſe; the poor creature is forced to dive again directly, and the moment he does, they diſperſe again as faſt as they came, and every one gives heed to his poſt, to ſee where it will ſtart up again; which is an uncertain thing, and is commonly three quarters of a mile from the former ſpot. If a Seal has a good broad water, three or four leagues each way, it can keep the ſportſmen in play for a couple of hours, before 'tis ſo ſpent that they can ſurround and kill it. If the Seal, in its fright, betakes itſelf to the land for a retreat, 'tis welcomed with ſticks and ſtones by the women and children, and preſently pierced by the men in the rear. This is a very lively and a very profitable diverſion for the <hi>Greenlanders,</hi> for many times one man will have eight or ten Seals for his ſhare.</p>
                              <p>The third method of killing Seals upon the ice, is moſtly prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in <hi>Diſko,</hi> where the bays are frozen over in the winter. There are ſeveral ways of proceeding. The Seals themſelves make ſometimes holes in the ice, where they come and draw breath; near ſuch a hole a <hi>Greenlander</hi> ſeats himſelf on a ſtool, putting his feet on a lower one to keep them from the cold. Now when the Seal comes and puts its noſe to the hole, he pierces it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly with his harpoon; then breaks the hole larger, and draws it out and kills it quite. Or a <hi>Greenlander</hi> lays himſelf upon his belly, on a kind of a ſledge, near other holes, where the Seal
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0591300301:377"/>
come out upon the ice to baſk themſelves in the ſun. Near this great hole they make a little one, and another <hi>Greenlander</hi> puts a harpoon into it with a very long ſhaft or pole. He that lies upon the ice looks into the great hole, till he ſees a Seal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the harpoon; then he gives the other the ſignal, who runs the Seal through with all his might.</p>
                              <p>If the <hi>Greenlander</hi> ſees a Seal lying near its hole upon the ice, he ſlides along upon his belly towards it, wags his head, and grunts like a Seal; and the poor Seal, thinking 'tis one of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent companions, lets him come near enough to pierce it with his long dart.</p>
                              <p>When the current wears a great hole in the ice in the ſpring, the <hi>Greenlanders</hi> plant themſelves all round it, till the Seals come in droves to the brim to fetch breath, and then they kill them with their harpoons. Many alſo are killed on the ice while they lie ſleeping and ſnoring in the ſun<note n="*" place="bottom">pp. 153, 4, 5, 6, 7.</note>.</p>
                           </q>
                           <p>Nature has been ſo niggardly in providing variety of proviſion for the <hi>Greenlanders,</hi> that they are neceſſitated to have recourſe to ſuch which is offered to them with a liberal hand.<note place="margin">USES IN KAMT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SCHATKA.</note> The <hi>Kamtſchatkan</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which enjoy ſeveral animals, as well as a great and abundant choice of fiſh, are ſo enamoured with the taſte of the fat of Seals, that they can make no feaſt without making it one of the diſhes. Of that both <hi>Ruſſians</hi> and <hi>Kamtſchatkans</hi> make their candles. The latter eat the fleſh boiled, or elſe dried in the ſun. If they have a great quantity, they preſerve it in the following manner:</p>
                           <p>They dig a pit of a requiſite depth, and pave it with ſtones; then fill it with wood, and ſet it on fire ſo as to heat the pit to the warmth of a ſtove. They then collect all the cinders into a heap. They ſtrew the bottom with the green wood of alder, on which they place ſeparately the fleſh and the fat, and put between every layer branches of the ſame tree; when the pit is filled they cover it with ſods, ſo that the vapour cannot eſcape. After ſome hours they take out both
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0591300301:378"/>
fat and fleſh, and keep it for winter's proviſions, and they may be preſerved a whole year without ſpoiling.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Kamtſchatkans</hi> have a moſt ſingular ceremony.<note place="margin">SUPERSTITIOUS CUSTOM.</note> After they take the fleſh from the heads of the Seals, they bring a veſſel in form of a canoe, and fling into it all the ſculls, crowned with certain herbs, and place them on the ground. A certain perſon enters the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a ſack filled with <hi>Tonchitche,</hi> ſweet herbs, and a little of the bark of willow. Two of the natives then roll a great ſtone towards the door, and cover it with pebbles; two others take the ſweet herbs and diſpoſe them, tied in little packets. The great ſtone is to ſignify the ſea-ſhore, the pebbles the waves, and the packets Seals. They then bring three diſhes of a haſh, called <hi>Tolkoucha;</hi> of this they make little balls, in the middle of which they ſtick the packets of herbs: of the willow-bark they make a little canoe, and fill it with <hi>Tolkoucha,</hi> and cover it with the ſack. After ſome time, the two <hi>Kamtſchatkans</hi> who had put the mimic Seals into the <hi>Tolkoucha,</hi> take the balls, and a veſſel reſembling a canoe, and draw it along the ſand, as if it was on the ſea, to convince the real Seals how agreeable it would be to them to come among the <hi>Kamtſchatkans,</hi> who have a ſea in their very <hi>jurts,</hi> or dwellings. And this they imagine will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Seals to ſuffer themſelves to be taken in great numbers. Various other ceremonies, equally ridiculous, are practiſed; in one of which they <hi>invoke the winds, which drive the Seals on their ſhores, to be propitious</hi>

                              <note place="margin">CAPTURE.</note>The Seals in this country are killed by harpooning, by ſhooting, by watching the holes in the ice and knocking them on the head as they riſe; or by placing two or three ſtrong nets acroſs one of the rivers which theſe animals frequent: fifty or more people aſſemble in canoes on each ſide of the nets, while others row up and down, and with great cries frighten the Seals into them. As ſoon as any are entangled, the people kill them with pikes or clubs, and drag them on ſhore, and divide them equally among the hunters; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a hundred are taken at a time in this manner.</p>

                           <p>SEAL. With four cutting teeth above, four below: fore feet like the human; the thumb long: the membranes on the hind feet extend beyond the claws: on the forehead of the male is a thick folded ſkin, ridged half the way up, which it can inflate and draw down like a cap, to defend its eyes againſt ſtorms, waves, ſtones, and ſand. The females and young have only the rudiment of this guard. It has two ſpecies of hair; the longeſt white, the ſhorteſt thick, black, and woolly, which gives it a beautiful grey color.</p>
                           <p>It grows to the length of eight feet. The <hi>Greenlanders</hi> call it <hi>Neitſek-ſoak</hi>

Is polygamous; copulates with its body erect. Brings forth in <hi>April</hi> one young upon the ice. Keeps much on the great fragments, where it ſleeps in an unguarded way. Bites hard: barks, and whines: grows very fierce on being wounded; but will weep on being ſurprized by the hunter. Fight among themſelves, and inflict deep wounds. Feed on all kinds of greater fiſh. The ſkins of the young form the moſt elegant dreſſes for the women. The men cover their great boats with thoſe of the old; they alſo cover their houſes with them, and when they grow old convert them into ſacks. They uſe the teeth to head hunting-ſpears. Of the gullet and inteſtines they make the ſea-dreſſes. The ſtomach is made into a fiſhing-buoy.</p>
                           <p>It is alſo found in <hi>Newfoundland.</hi> Our Seal-hunters name it the <hi>Hooded</hi> Seal, and pretend they cannot kill it till they remove that integument. The <hi>Germans</hi> call it <hi>Klap-Mutz,</hi> from its covering its face as if with a cap.</p>
                           <p>The moſt dreaded enemy which this ſpecies has in <hi>Greenland,</hi> is the <hi>Phyſeter Microps;</hi> on the very ſight of which it takes to the ice,

                           <p>SEAL. With a round head: high forehead: noſe ſhort: large black eyes: whiſkers diſpoſed in ten rows of hairs: four cutting teeth in the upper jaw, the two middlemoſt the longeſt; four alſo in the lower, leſs ſharp than the others: two canine teeth in each jaw: ſix grinders in each jaw, each three-pointed: hairs ſhort: ſkin thick and ſtrong.</p>
                           <p>Head, noſe, and chin, of a deep cheſnut color, nearly black; reſt of the body of a dirty white, or light grey: on the top of the ſhoulders is a large mark of the ſame color; with the head bifurcated, each fork extending downwards along the ſides half way the length of the body. This mark is always conſtant; but there are beſides a few irregular ſpots incidental to the old ones.</p>
                           <p>The female has only two, retractile, teats; and brings only one young at a time. The cub, the firſt year, is of a bright aſh-color, whitiſh beneath, and marked in all parts with multitudes of ſmall black ſpots, at which period they are called by the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> White Seals.

It never aſcends the fixed ice; but lives and ſleeps on the floating iſlands in great herds. Swims in great numbers, having one for a leader, which ſeems to watch for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the whole. Eats its prey with its head above water. Swims in various ways; on its belly, back, and ſide, and often whirls about as if in frolick. Frequently ſleeps on the ſurface of the water. Is very incautious. Has great dread of the <hi>Phyſeter Microps,</hi> which forces it towards the ſhore. It is often ſurrounded by troops of hunters, who compel it even to land, where it is eaſily killed.</p>

                              <note place="margin">USES.</note>The ſkin is uſed to cover trunks; that of the young, taken in the iſle of <hi>Solovki,</hi> on the weſt ſide of the <hi>White Sea,</hi> is made into boots, and is excellent for keeping out water.

them thicker. With theſe they cover their boats, and with the undreſſed ſkins their tents; and, when they can get no other, make uſe of them for cloathing.</p>
                           <p>The oil extracted from the blubber of this Seal is far the moſt valuable, being ſweet, and ſo free from greaves as to yield a greater quantity than any other ſpecies. The fleſh is black.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Newfoundland</hi> Seal-hunters call it the <hi>Harp,</hi> or <hi>Heart</hi> Seal, and name the marks on the ſides the ſaddle. They ſpeak too of a brown ſort, which they call <hi>Bedlemer,</hi> and believe to be the young of the former.</p>

                           <p>The whole animal is of great deformity: the neck thick, and its union with the head ſcarcely diſcernible: the two feet, or rather fins, are fixed near the ſhoulders; are only twenty-ſix inches long; are deſtitute of toes, or nails, but terminate in a ſort of hoof, concave beneath, lined with briſtles, and fitted for digging in ſand.</p>
                           <p>The outward ſkin is black, rugged, and knotty, like the bark of an aged oak: without any hair; an inch thick, and ſo hard as ſcarcely to be cut with an ax; and when cut, appears in the inſide like ebony. From the nape to the tail it is marked with circular wrinkles riſing into knots, and ſharp points on the ſide. This ſkin covers the whole
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0591300301:399"/>
body like a cruſt, and is of ſingular uſe to the animal during winter, in protecting it againſt the ice, under which it often feeds, or againſt the ſharp-pointed rocks, againſt which it is often daſhed by the wintry ſtorms. It is alſo an equal guard againſt the ſummer heats; for this animal does not, like moſt other marine creatures, feed at the bottom, but with part of the body expoſed, as well to the rays of the ſun as to the piercing cold of the froſt. In fact, this inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is ſo eſſential to its preſervation, that <hi>Steller</hi> has obſerved ſeveral dead on the ſhore, which he believes were killed by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental privation of it. The color of this ſkin, when wet, is duſky, when dried, quite black.</p>
                           <p>The tail is horizontally flat;<note place="margin">TAIL.</note> black, and ending in a ſtiff fin, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of laminae like whale-bone, terminating with fibres near nine inches long. It is ſlightly forked; but both ends are of equal lengths, like the tail of a Whale.</p>
                           <p>It has two teats placed exactly on the breaſt. The milk is thick and ſweet, not unlike that of a Ewe. Theſe animals copulate <hi>more humano,</hi> and in the ſeaſon of courtſhip ſport long in the ſea; the female feigning to ſhun the embraces of the male, who purſues her through all the mazes of her flight.</p>
                           <p>The body, from the ſhoulders to the navel, is very thick; from thence to the tail grows gradually more ſlender. The belly is very large; and, by reaſon of the quantity of entrails, very tumid.</p>

                           <p>Theſe animals frequent the ſhallow and ſandy parts of the ſhores,<note place="margin">MANNERS.</note> and near the mouths of the ſmall rivers of the iſland of <hi>Bering,</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly pleaſed with the ſweet water. They go in herds: the old keep behind and drive their young before them: and ſome keep on their ſides, by way of protection. On the riſing of the tide they
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0591300301:401"/>
approach the ſhores, and are ſo tame as to ſuffer themſelves to be ſtroked: if they are roughly treated, they move towards the ſea; but ſoon forget the injury, and return.</p>
                           <p>They live in families near one another: each conſiſts of a male and female, a half-grown young, and a new-born one. The families often unite, ſo as to form vaſt droves. They are monogamous. They bring forth a ſingle young, but have no particular time of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turition; but chiefly, as <hi>Steller</hi> imagines, about <hi>autumn.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>They are moſt innocent and harmleſs in their manners, and moſt ſtrongly attached to one another. When one is hooked, the whole herd will attempt its reſcue: ſome will ſtrive to overſet the boat, by going beneath it; others will fling themſelves on the rope of the hook and preſs it down, in order to break it; and others again will make the utmoſt efforts to force the inſtrument out of its wounded companion.</p>
                           <p>Their conjugal affection is moſt exemplary: a male, after uſing all its endeavours to releaſe its mate which had been ſtruck, purſued it to the very edge of the water; no blows could force it away. As long as the deceaſed female continued in the water, he perſiſted in his attendance; and even for three days after ſhe was drawn on ſhore, and even cut up and carried away, was obſerved to remain, as if in expectation of her return.</p>
                           <p>They are moſt voracious creatures, and feed with their head under water, quite inattentive of the boats, or any thing that paſſes about them; moving and ſwimming gently after one another, with much of their back above water. A ſpecies of louſe harbours in the roughneſs of their coats, which the Gulls pick out, ſitting on them as Crows do on Hogs and Sheep. Every now and then they lift their noſe out of the water to take breath, and make a noiſe like the ſnort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Horſes. When the tide retires, they ſwim away along with it; but ſometimes the young are left aſhore till the return of the water: otherwiſe they never quit that element: ſo that in nature, as well as form, they approach the cetaceous animals, and are the link between Seals and them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0591300301:402"/>They were taken on <hi>Bering</hi>'s iſle by a great hook faſtened to a long rope. Four or five people took it with them in a boat,<note place="margin">CAPTURE.</note> and rowed amidſt a herd. The ſtrongeſt man took the inſtrument, ſtruck it into the neareſt animal; which done, thirty people on ſhore ſeized the rope, and with great difficulty drew it on ſhore. The poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes the ſtrongeſt reſiſtance, aſſiſted by its faithful companions. It will cling with its feet to the rocks till it leaves the ſkin behind; and often great fragments of the cruſty integument fly off before it can be landed. It is an animal full of blood; ſo that it ſpouts in amazing quantities from the orifice of the wound.</p>
                           <p>They have no voice; only, when wounded, emit a deep ſigh.</p>
                           <p>They have the ſenſes of ſight and hearing very imperfect; or at leſt neglect the uſe of them.</p>
                           <p>They are not migratory; for they were ſeen about <hi>Bering</hi>'s iſland the whole of the ſad ten months which Mr. <hi>Steller</hi> paſſed there after his ſhipwreck.</p>

It would often ſtand erect for a conſiderable ſpace, with one-third of its body above water; then dart beneath the ſhip, and appear on the other ſide; and repeat the ſame thirty times together.
