            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with whom he got an annuity of 500 merks, payable out of
ſome houſes in the <hi>Cowgate</hi> which ſhe had from—<hi>Gilchriſt</hi>
her former Huſband. But ſo far was ſhe from bringing the
money alledged with her, that her houſhold-furniture was ſold
to pay her debt, and was not ſufficient; neither could it be,
as her firſt Huſband was bankrupt, and his eſtate ſoon after
brought to ſale before your Lordſhips, and purchaſed by
Bailie <hi>Thomſon,</hi> for payment of which he ſold part of the
lands in <hi>Potterow</hi> which came by his firſt wife. During the
ſubſiſtence of this marriage, Bailie <hi>Thomſon</hi> purchaled ſome
houſes, and ſold others, and carried on an extenſive trade as
a Brewer and Diſtiller, which was managed by the Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from 1721 to 1729; when the Petitioner wanting to
have the Reſpondent away from his Father's preſence, and
from any management in his buſineſs, prevailed on the Father
to take a Brewery for him; for which he promiſed to give
him at the rate of 15 bolls of malt for all the years he had ſerved
in his brewery; part of which he got, but not near to the
quantity promiſed; which was all the ſtock the Reſpondent
had from his Father, and was far from being ſufficient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
him to carry on his trade.</p>
            <p>But ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut the 1732, the Bailie finding his own Brewery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affairs
going into diſorder under the management of the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
be ſolicited the Reſpondent to come back again, and
take upon him the management thereof; which he did, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the promiſe of ten pound <hi>per annum,</hi> to keep his pocket:
which he never got. So that the Petitioner is in the wrong
to ſay, that the Bailie's affairs were brought into diſorder by
any advancements or cautionry for him. It is true he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
bound for <hi>Andrew,</hi> his ſecond Son, at his ſetting up a
cloth and ſilk ſhop, to the extent of L. 200; which will fall
to be more particularly noticed afterwards: Baſides this, the
Bailie gave a portion with his Daughter when ſhe was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried;
but the Reſpondent knows not what that was and he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1296604000:3"/>
gave L. 20 to his third ſon <hi>Adam,</hi> who was bred a Surgeon,
when he went abroad. This is all, ſo far as the Reſpondent
knows, that the Bailie gave to his children of the firſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
which was far from bringing his affairs into any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order;
for, after that he continued in very good circumſtances,
poſſeſſed of houſes which yielded him L. 176 a-year of rent,
beſides his extenſive trade as Brewer and Diſtiller.</p>
            <p>The Bailie finding himſelf growing old,<note place="margin">1738.</note> of this date,
thought it reaſonable, to make a Settlement of his eſtate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his children of the firſt and ſecond marriage; in which
he diſponed to the Reſpondent his houſes in <hi>Briſtow</hi> and
<hi>Potterow,</hi> which yeilded L. 22 of rent; beſides which, he
had formerly, at making the purchaſe of the Brewery in the
Graſs-market, and ſome other houſes in the Town, ſecured
the fee of them to the Reſpondent; which made the ſhare
deſigned him by his Father to be about L. 80 a-year; but
this was burthened with the Petitioner's liferent to the extent
of L. 58: 5: 6. He likewiſe diſponed to <hi>Adam,</hi> his third
Son of the firſt marriage, lands in the Weſt-port to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of L. 13, and to <hi>John</hi> his eldeſt Son of the ſecond mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
he gave lands about the foot of <hi>Forreſter</hi>'s wynd, and
about the Meal-market and Exchange, which yielded
L. 57: 15 s. of rent; and to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> his ſecond Son of
the ſecond marriage, he gave his lands in the <hi>Cannongate</hi> head,
which yeilded L. 12: 10 s. of rent; to <hi>Anne</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth,</hi>
he gave the lands in <hi>Netherbow</hi> and <hi>Leith,</hi> which
yeilded L. 20, 15 s. of rent; to <hi>Jean</hi> and <hi>Helen;</hi> he gave
ſome houſes above Smith's Land: but as theſe were ſold by
himſelf, he, by an after-deed, burthened his executors with
the payment of L. 100 to each of them; and to <hi>Janet,</hi> he
gave his houſes in <hi>Niddrey</hi>'s wynd, which yielded L. 9, 5 s.
and as the Reſpondent's part was ſo far affected with the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner's
liſerent, the Bailie burthened <hi>John</hi> with the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of 200 merks to him during the continuance of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1296604000:4"/>
liferent, and with a 100 merks to <hi>Andrew</hi> his ſecond Son
during his life, to whom he gave no part of his heritance.</p>
            <p>Here it will be proper to inform your Lordſhips of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew's</hi>
ſituation. It has been already obſerved, that the Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
had become bound with his Son <hi>Andrew,</hi> at his ſetting up
ſhop, for L. 200 to <hi>Robert Pringle.</hi> Upon this ſtock, <hi>Andrew</hi>
carried on buſineſs for ſome time, and dealt with <hi>Snee</hi> and
Company Merchants in London; but his ſales not being able
to anſwer his credit, and his Father refuſing to become fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bound for him, his London Creditors refuſed to give
him any more advances, and were threating diligence: to prevent
which, and to bring the Creditors into a compoſition, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
that he ſhould make over, by aſſignation, his whole
ſhop goods, extending to near L. 300 to his Father, who,
about this time. had got right to the debt for which he had
become Cautioner. And the whole goods were put into his
poſſeſſion; but having got poſſeſſion thereof, he was perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
by ſome very bad advice, to refuſe to give the ſaid En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Creditors, who were the only other Creditors of <hi>Andrew,</hi>
any ſhare thereof, tho' they were willing to have accepted ten
ſhillings in the pound. And, for his further ſecurity, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
a ſham-poinding of theſe goods already in his own
hands; which ſo irritated the Creditors, that they indorſed
their Bills to Mr <hi>Mansfield,</hi> who brought a proceſs againſt
the Bailie for payment of their debt, extending to L, 197: 9
: 11; in which the Aſſignation and Poinding were reduced.
But the Bailie dying before Decreet was pronounced, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
was transferred againſt the Petitioner, and all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Bailie of the firſt and ſecond marriage, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
was obtained againſt them all ſor that ſum. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
and perhaps ſome reflections by <hi>Andrew</hi> that his
Father had not acted according to the agreement with him,
was the reaſon why the Bailie, in the Settlement of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair's,
gave him nothing but the liferent-annuity of 100 merks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1296604000:5"/>
The Bailie, about this time, finding himſelf a dying exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
a Settlement of his moveables to the Petitioner,<note place="margin">1743</note> Mr.
<hi>Montgomery,</hi> now Commiſſioner of the Cuſtoms. <hi>William
Wardrobe, John Bell,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Chalmer,</hi> as Truſtees for
his five daughters of the ſecond marriage, who were autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed
to turn all his moveables into money, to be ſtock't out
on annual rent, and to be liferented by the Petitioner for the
aliment and education of her children; and in reſpect he had
ſold the houſes diſponed to <hi>Jean</hi> and <hi>Helen</hi> in the Settlement
1738, he ordained them to ſecure L. 100 Sterl to each of them,
beſide their ſhare of the reſidue, which they were to draw
with the reſt of their Siſters, when the liſerent ceaſed; But
it is expreſsly provided, That, during the Petitioner's life and
continuing unmarried, ſhe was to have the ſole management of
theſe ſubjects, and the management of the other Truſtees
was only to commence when any one of theſe events happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
ſo that the Petitioner has no reaſon to complain that theſe
Truſtees refuſed to accept of the truſt, ſeeing, during her
life, they could have no power to act. In this deed, the
Truſtees are appointed to ſell the houſes in Cannongate-head,
which he by the deed 1738 had conveyed to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was
then dead, and to pay the price thereof to the Truſtees for
the Creditors of Mr <hi>Mantgomery</hi> of <hi>Wrae,</hi> from whom he had
bought it at a judicial ſale.</p>
            <p>Bailie <hi>Thomſon</hi> having thus ſettled his affairs, wherein he
did full juſtice to the Petitioner and her children, died ſoon
after in opulent circumſtances, as was reputed by all that
knew him, both in heritage and moveables, and not above
L. 500 of debt: and after his death, there was a meeting
of ſome friends for the Reſpondent with the Petitioner; at
which ſhe complained loudly of the Bailie's Settlements, and
alledged his affairs were in diſorder, and that his effects
would not be able to anſwer his debts, and the other purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
therein deſigned: upon which an offer was made for the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1296604000:6"/>
Reſpondent, that if ſhe would give up her right to the movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
ſhe ſhould have ſufficient ſecurity for L. 500 to herſelf
and Children, and be freed of all her huſband's debts. But
this ſhe abſolutely refuſed; and as ſhe had a right to the
moveables, ſo ſhe kept poſſeſſion of them; and ſhe has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that ſhe likewiſe kept poſſeſſion and uplifted the
rents of all the houſes belonging to her huſband, except two
or three little houſes which the Reſpondent uplifted the rents
of, which afforded him but a ſcrimp maintainence; and the
Petitioner, after keeping poſſeſſion of her Huſband's effects,
and carrying on the Brewing and Diſtilling as formerly, from
the month of April, when her Huſband died, to the month
of December, ſhe at laſt confirmed herſelf executor, but took
care to give up as little in Inventary, as ſhe could with decency
do.</p>
            <p>The Reſpondent being thus ſtript of his Father's inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
was about raiſing a Proceſs for recovering his right,
when a Submiſſion was propoſed, which was readily gone into
by him and his Brother <hi>Andrew,</hi> who likewiſe thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
injured, as they had not money to carry on proceſſes;
and their diſputes were accordingly ſubmitted to Meſſ.

with the parties and their Doers; but in all their meetings,
eſpecially after the 1745, he perceived an evident partiality
in favours of the Petitioner, who got allowance of every
article claimed by her. But this Submiſſion happening to
expire without any Decreet-arbitral being pronounced, the
Reſpondent was reſolved never to ſubmit his affair again to
theſe Arbiters, and brought a Proceſs againſt the Petitioner
before the Sheriff, to account for her intromiſſions with her
Huſband's effects, and for freeing him of his Father's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable
debts.</p>
            <p>The Petitioner, afraid of being brought to account, and
anxious to have the Submiſſion renewed to the ſame Arbiters,
fell upon this ſtratagem. She paid <hi>Mansfield</hi>'s debt, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1296604000:7"/>
took right to his Decreet and Diligence in the name of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Richaradſon</hi> her Truſtee, which Decreet was againſt her
and all the Repreſentatives of Bailie <hi>Thomſon,</hi> and which ſhe,
as ſole intromitter with his effects, was obliged to pay; and
upon this diligence a Caption was raiſed, and the Reſpondent
was taken, and threatned with being put in priſon, unleſs he
would renew the Submiſſion to the ſame Arbiters; which he
alſolutely refuſed; whereupon he was put in priſon on the
14th July 1748, an his Brother <hi>Andrew,</hi> who was then in
a dying condition under a decay, came up in the afternoon
to ſee him, and he was likewiſe arreſted; but no intreaties,
by his wife and her friends, repreſenting the danger he was in
of dying in priſon, could prevail with Mr <hi>Richardſon,</hi> the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner's
Truſtee, and <hi>John Walker,</hi> her Son-in-law and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Doer, to conſent to his liberation, unleſs the Reſpondent
and his Brother would ſign a new Submiſſion to theſe Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
So they paſt that night in priſon, in which <hi>Andrew</hi> had
almoſt died, which, with the moſt earneſt ſolicitations of
<hi>Andrew</hi>'s wife and her Couſin Bailie <hi>Blackwood,</hi> and of <hi>George
Balfour, Andrew</hi>'s Doer, induced the Reſpondent next day to
ſign this extraordinary Submiſſion; but at the ſame time he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that he would rather have lain in priſon till he rotted,
than have ſigned the Submiſſion to theſe Arbiters, had it not
been out of regard to his Brother, and ſave his life. And
here its to be obſerved, that theſe ſolicitors were all the friends
of <hi>Andrew,</hi> and acting for him, but had no connection with
the Reſpondent.</p>
            <p>Upon ſigning of this Submiſſion, they were ſoon after ſet
at liberty, and not the leaſt demand was made upon either of
them for payment of the debt upon which they were laid in
priſon, nor of any corroborative ſecurity therefor. They had
obtained the ſole purpoſe for which they had execute the
Caption; but they took care, that <hi>Richardſon,</hi> in whoſe name
the Caption was, ſhould noit be a party-ſubmitter; ſo that
Diligence was ſtill kept as an aweband over their heads, in caſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1296604000:8"/>
they ſhould offer to quarrel the Submiſſion on account of its
being extorted from them <hi>metu carceris,</hi> it being in their power
to put it in execution at any time.</p>
            <p>Whether the Arbiters had any meetings afterwards before
the ſigning of the Decreet-arbitral upon the 6th November
following, the Reſpondent knows not; but one thing he is
ſure of, that he never met with them after, nor did he ever
deſire or impower his Doer <hi>William Garden</hi> to meet with
them, or to give in any papers or Memorials to them; and,
ſo far as he knows, Mr <hi>Garden</hi> never met with any of them,
nor gave in any Memorials to them; for he had told him
that he was reſolved to quarrel the Submiſſion whenever he
was in a capacity to do it.</p>
            <p>The Decreet-arbitral was no ſooner put into the Regiſter,
than a Charge was given to the Reſpondent to obtemper the
Decreet-arbitral; and upon his refuſing, a Caption was taken
out, which obliged him to retire to the Abbey, and there he
was narrowly watched for ſeveral years with different Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,
in caſe he ſhould happen at any time to come out of
the Sanctuary. As he was ſtript of all his Father's inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and had nothing to live on but the charity of friends,
it was no wonder that he was not able to bring his quarrel of
this Submiſſion and Decreet-arbitral ſooner.</p>
            <p>The Petitioner having got the Decreet-arbitral abſolutely
to her mind, ſhe, for herſelf and children, and her ſon-in-law
<hi>John Walker,</hi> led Adjudications againſt the eſtate; which
obliged the other Creditors likewiſe to adjudge; and a proceſs
of Ranking and Sale was carried on in the name of <hi>Richard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
the Petitioner's Truſtee, in which a ſtate of the debts
was made out, where ſhe, her children, and <hi>John Walker</hi>
her ſon-in-law craved to be ranked for no leſs a ſum than
L. 1405: 3: 10 Sterling; which is more than the proven
value of the eſtate, and would have been tanked accordingly,
of the Reſpondent had not appeared, and oppoſed the ſame;
and this over and above the Pettioner's, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1296604000:9"/>
the whole moveables of her Huſband, and the rents of his
eſtate for 9 years, when the Reſpondent, the father's eldeſt
Son, and heir to his mother, who brought ſo large a part of
this ſubject with her, is ſtript of all.</p>
            <p>The Reſpondent hopes he will be excuſed in giving your
Lordſhips ſo full a detail of paſt tranſactions, which he thought
himſelf obliged to do, that your Lordſhips might have a juſt
and true view of the matter. He ſhall now proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the ſeveral arguments inſiſted upon for altering the Lord
Ordinary's Interlocutor, twice adhered to by his Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is, That there is no legal evidence that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
was ſigned in priſon. As to which, it is true, that
Mr <hi>Alexander Blackwood</hi> is the only perſon who depones to
the preciſe fact of the Submiſſion being ſigned in priſon; but
as he was an inſtrumentary witneſs to their ſigning the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
there, and the only ſurviving inſtrumentary witneſs, it
is ſubmitted to your Lordſhips, whether his ſingle Depoſition
is not a ſufficient proof of the fact, in which he could not be
miſtaken nor under any doubt, though he uſes the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution,
which every witneſs is allowed to do, eſpecially when
deponing of facts which happened 12 years before, <q>That,
to the beſt of his remembrance, he carried up a ſcrole
of the propoſed Submiſſion to the priſoners, which they
reviſed; and that they having agreed to the ſcrole, he
afterwards carried up the Submiſſion extended upon ſtamp
paper; and that, to the beſt of his remembrance, he received
both the ſcrole and principal Submiſſion, either from Mr
<hi>Balfour,</hi> or from Mrs <hi>Thomſon,</hi> the priſoner's wife: and
that, to the beſt of his remembrance, he ſaw both the ſaid
<hi>James</hi> and <hi>Andrew Thomſon</hi>'s ſign the ſaid principal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
in the priſon; to which, ſo far as he can recollect,
he is a ſubſcribing witneſs; and that the Deponent thinks
they were very ſoon releaſed after ſigning the Submiſſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He alſo ſays. <q>That he remembers that both the ſaid <hi>James</hi>
and <hi>Andrew Thomſons</hi> ſeemed averſe to enter into the ſaid
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1296604000:10"/>
Submiſſion; and that <hi>James</hi> in particular ſaid, he was
afraid it might hurt him with reſpect to ſome deeds execute
by his Father in favours of him the ſaid <hi>James.</hi> He
ſwears likewiſe to <hi>Andrew</hi>'s bad ſtate of health, and that
his wife was anxious for his liberation, and told him that
their liberation was offered them upon condition of their
ſigning a Submiſſion; and that, at her deſire, he went ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times up to priſon to perſwade him; and that <hi>George
Balfour, Andrew</hi>'s Doer, was with him at ſome of theſe
times.</q> This, the Reſpondent apprehends, is as full and
ſatisfying a proof as can be deſired, and as could well be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
when the other inſtrumentary witneſs is dead. And
it is confirmed in every other circumſtance, except the ſigning
of the Submiſſion in priſon, by <hi>Maney Blackwood,</hi> the widow
of <hi>Andrew Thomſon,</hi> who, as being more particularly concerned
in the affair than Bailie <hi>Blackwood,</hi> is more pointed and clear
as to ſeveral circumſtances attending that tranſaction than he
can be ſuppoſed to be at ſuch a diſtance of time, and in an
affair where he had but an accidental concern. And if this
proof ſhould not be thought ſufficient, the Reſpondent could
yet adduce two other witneſſes, <hi>Alexander Henderſon</hi> and <hi>James
Brown,</hi> who came up to them in priſon, after their ſigning
the Submiſſion, and were employed by them to go and ſeek
money to pay the priſon-dues, in order to their getting out.</p>
            <p>It is next ſaid, That though the fact of ſigning the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
in priſon was proven, yet it was not relevant to ſet
aſide the decreet-arbitral, which is indeavoured to be ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at great length, and ſeveral caſes are taken notice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
tranſactions with debtors in priſon for payment of juſt
debts, or for granting additional ſecurities therefore. But the
Reſpondent apprehends, that the law is quite clear, by the
Civil law the edict of Praetor was the rule, <hi>Quod metus
cauſa geſtum erit ratum non babebo.</hi> And in the 22d <hi>l. dig.
Quod metus cauſa in carcerem quem detruſit ut aliquid ei ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torqueret,
quid ob banc cauſam ſactum eſt, nultius momenti eſt.</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1296604000:11"/>
And Lord <hi>Stair, tit. Reparation, parag.</hi> 8. That, by the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's
edict, and the cuſtom of this and other nations, ſuch
deeds and obligations as are by force and fear, are made utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
void; and he cites a deciſion very parallel to the preſent
caſe, 22d January 1667, <hi>Mair contra Stewart</hi> of <hi>Shambelly,</hi>
where <hi>metus</hi> was ſuſtained to reduce a Bond granted by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
taken by Caption, becauſe he was ſick. The Reſpondent
apprehends, that there is no compulſitor in law to oblige a
perſon to enter into a Submiſſion: That can only be brought
about by the free and voluntary conſent of parties; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the uſing a diligence, which is allowed by law, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
payment of a debt, for this purpoſe, is a perverting
of the law; and the uſing it ſo againſt a perſon ſick and in
danger of dying, was a glaring and groſs perverting of the
law, which the Petitioner is forced to own will afford a ground
for reducing theſe deeds as exported <hi>vi et metu carceris.</hi> The
Reſpondent might add, That as the Petitioner had poſſeſſed
herſelf of all her Huſband's effects, and ſhe has acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
that ſhe had paid that debt, no doubt, out of the
produce of her Huſband's effects, as ſhe had no other funds,
he ſubmits it to your Lordſhips, how far ſhe could have uſed
that diligence againſt the Reſpondent for re-payment of it to
her, as ſhe the executrix had already paid it out of the funds
of her Huſband the original debtor; and if ſhe could not, then
all her argument juſtifying the impriſonment of the Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and his Brother, falls to the ground.</p>
            <p>The Reſpondent apprehends, he needs not take up much
time in anſwering the ſeveral caſes founded on by the petitioner
in ſupport of her claim; for in theſe the intention of impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment
was to get payment or ſecurity, and the debtor was
under an obligation to pay the debt, or to grant further ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
for it, and if he either paid it in priſon, of granted
new ſecurity for it, he did no more than the law obliged him
to do; and therefore theſe tranſactions may be held good in
law, though done in priſon; and in theſe caſes the debtor
gave a full conſent to the tranſaction; whereas here the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1296604000:12"/>
gave no conſent to the thing, and ſhowed to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
that he only did it to ſave his Brother's life, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
perſonal liberty to both. But, at the ſame time, it is
certain, that if any iniquity was done to perſons in priſon by
theſe tranſactions, they would be reduced on this head, which
makes a very material difference between theſe caſes and the
preſent one; for here, if the ſubmiſſion be ſupported, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet-arbitral
following thereon, how iniquous ſoever, cannot
be reduced, iniquity not being one of the grounds of law for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
a Decreet-arbitral.</p>
            <p>The Petitioner endeavours to juſtify her inſiſting on a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
as a reaſonable action for ſettling the mutual claims,
which each party had on one another. But here it will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that the Petitioner had no claim upon the Reſpondent,
but to get him to confirm her illegal uſurpation of all her
Huſband's eſtate. He indeed had a claim againſt her, to
reſtore to him what part of his Father's inheritance he had left
to him, and to free him of his Father's moveable debts, which
ſhe was obliged to do, as intromitter with his moveable effects.
But, from paſt experience, he had found that he was in no
likelihood to obtain this before the former Arbiters; and
therefore, nothing but to ſave his Brother's life, could have
induced him to ſubmit his cauſe again to theſe Gentlemen.
However good their character may be otherwiſe, their decern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch a ſum to the Petitioner and her children, and, at the
ſame time, ſtripping the Reſpondent is ſufficient to ſhow the
iniquity of their Decreet-arbitral. But he apprehends his
plea for reducing the Submiſſion is good, upon the head of
fear and force.</p>
            <p>The Petitioner ſays, That the Reſpondent did homologate
the Submiſſion, when he was at liberty, by his Doer <hi>William
Garden,</hi> giving in Memorials and other papers to the Arbiters
upon the ſubject of the Submiſſion. This has already been
taken notice of, and denied; and it is but very faintly alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the Petitioner; for all ſhe can ſay on this head is, that
it appears from Mr. <hi>Garden's</hi> compt-book, where he ſtates an
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1296604000:13"/>
article, in his accompt with the Reſpondent, for drawing a
Memorial to be given in to theſe Arbiters. How the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
got acceſs to Mr <hi>Garden</hi>'s compt-books, is not known;
but from her ſtating it, it does not appear, whether this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
was to be given in to the Arbiters, during the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the firſt Submiſſion, or of the ſecond. Neither does
it appear whether ever that Memorial was given in to the
Arbiters: But, if it was given in to them, during the ſecond
Submſſion, he poſitively denies that ever he gave Mr <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
any warrant or commiſſion to give in ſuch Memorial.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, in ſupport of his having homologate the Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that he made no challenge of it for ſome years, though
he was at his full liberty all the while. Your Lordſhips will
have obſerved, from the narrative of the caſe, that he was
far from being at liberty; the Petitioner had no leſs than two
Captions againſt him, one upon <hi>Mansfield</hi>'s debt, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the Decreet-arbitral, and the Meſſengers hired to
watch him, in caſe he came out of the Abbey. It was, no
doubt, the Reſpondent's intereſt to have brought his quarrel
ſooner; but his want of liberty, and eſpecially his want of
money to carry on the proceſs, was the occaſion of the delay;
and if he had not got your Lordſhips <hi>gratis</hi> warrant, he muſt
have been ſilent ſtill; at the ſame time, he apprehends, it
would have been competent to him to have brought his action
any time within forty years.</p>
            <p>It is an affected pretence in the Petitioner to ſay, that ſhe has
loſt the vouchers of her accompts, which ſhe looked upon as
unneceſſary to be kept for ſo long a time, by which ſhe could
have ſupported the Decreet-arbitral in every point; for your
Lordſhips will have obſerved, that the Reſpondent, <hi>de recenti,</hi>
refuſed to ratify and fulfil the Decreet-arbitral, and ſaid he
would quarrel it whenever he had it in his power; whereupon,
ſhe took a Caption againſt him; and that being the caſe, it is
not probable that ſhe has loſt any one of her vouchers.</p>
            <p>In ſupport of the reaſons of reduction before the Lord Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
ſeveral particular iniquities committed by the Arbiters,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1296604000:14"/>
were mentioned, and many more could have been inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on; but, as there Were Objections and Anſwers lying before
his Lordſhip, to be adviſed when the Decreet-arbitral ſhould
be ſet aſide, there were only a few noticed, which the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
has endeavoured to take off, which makes it neceſſary
for the Reſpondent to reſume them, though he thinks his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
well founded without them. The <hi>firſt</hi> was, That
ſhe ought to have ſhown diligence for ſetting the houſes, and
for recovering the rents and outſtanding debts, which the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters
had not found her liable to do; upon which it is now
ſaid that iniquity in Arbiters is no ground for reducing their
Decreet-arbitral; and <hi>2dly,</hi> That it would have been impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for an executor to waſte the funds of the executry in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diligence for debts, where there was not the ſmalleſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of recovery; but, at this rate, every executor might
have it in his power to do what ſhe pleaſed with the executry
without being liable to quarrel from any hand; whereas, It
is an eſtabliſhed rule in law, That an executor muſt make up
full inventaries in a cafe, where there is a competition of Clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mants,
whether creditors or heirs, and is liable to do diligence
for making the executry effectual, and is obliged to find a
cautioner for that effect. No body, to be ſure, would inſiſt
that ſhe ſhould lay out good money in ſeeking in deſperate
debts; but ſtill it was incumbent upon her to ſhew what of
theſe debts were deſperate, which ſhe was not ordained to do
by the Arbiters.</p>
            <p>The Petitioner now has acknowledged, that ſhe has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
of the executry to the amount of L. 700 Sterling,
and upwards; the Reſpondent believes ſhe has or might have
recovered a great deal mare as it was reputed to be above L. 1600.
But here a queſtion naturally occurs, What has ſhe done with
this great ſum of executry intromitted with by her? The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct's
moveable debts ought naturally to have been paid out of
his executry. Has ſhe done that? it is believed ſhe will not anſwer
in the affirmative; the debts of her Huſband were in and about
L. 500 Sterling; and it appears from the liſt of debts now in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1296604000:15"/>
the Ranking, that they are all ſtill outſtanding, and not ſo
much as the annualrent of any of them paid, though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this executry intromitted with by her, ſhe had nine years
poſſeſſion of her huſband's heritable eſtate of L. 164 <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
except the two houſes poſſeſt by the Reſpondent; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
whereof the Arbiters find her a Creditor on the
ſubject for L. 101: 19: 11⅓ Sterling; and L. 95: 6: 6
Sterling.</p>
            <p>It was noticed before the Lord Ordinary, that the Arbiters
had committed iniquity in finding the Petitioner intitled to
aliment for her children, which is now ſaid to be highly juſt,
as their proviſions conſiſted in certain heritable ſubjects, which
were liferented by their Mother, and that therefore they were
intitled to be alimented with their Father's effects till they came
to enjoy their own proviſions. Here an obvious anſwer will
occur, The Father, by his deed in the 1738, diſponed to the
Petitioners children, houſes which yielded upwards of L. 90
of rent; and as the Petitioner's two liferents, amounting to
1100 merks, or L. 61: 2: 2 ⅔ Sterling, was laid upon the
Reſpondent's part of the heritage to the extent of L. 58: 5: 6
Sterl. it is evident that very little of her children's proviſions
ſtood affected with their Mother's liferent: So that if ſhe had
managed matters a-right, there was a ſufficiency to have aliment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her children out to their own proviſions; and ſhe had beſides
the reſidue of the executry over payment of the debts made over
to her by her huſband. But tho' that had not been the caſe,
a queſtion would have ariſen, in caſe the eſtate be bankrupt,
as ſhe pretends, Whether the Creditors would be obliged to
maintain her Children or not, eſpecially when ſhe their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was peaceably enjoying two jointures extending to 1100
merks, free of all publick burdens? And another queſtion
would have occured, whether the Reſpondent, as matters
ſtood by the deeds of his Father, would have been obliged
to aliment his Brothers and Siſters, ſuppoſing the eſtate had
not been bankrupt?</p>
            <p>Another article of complaint againſt the Decreet-arbitral
mentioned before the Ordinary was, That the expenses of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1296604000:16"/>
repairs of the houſes which ſhe had in liferent from her laſt
Huſband were allowed her, through that was not provided
in the Contract of Marriage, to which it is now ſaid that the
huſband became bound that the houſes ſhould yield 600
merks free of all taxations and publick burdens. But repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of liferented houſes, is a burden upon the liſerenter,
and is neither to be accounted a taxation or publick burden.</p>
            <p>The Petitioner, in the <hi>laſt</hi> place, endeavours to make an
apology for the ſmalneſs of the rent accounted for by her for
the five years of her intromiſſion preceeding the Decreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arbitral,
when compared with the five years rents uplifted by
your Lordſhips Factor, when the eſtate was ſequeſtrate, and
ſays, that ſundry of the houſes were waſte and in bad repair,
and that the ſums laid out by her in reparing them, made
them ſet better afterwards. But here it is to be obſerved,
that, after all her repairs, the higheſt rent ſhe brings up the
houſes to in the laſt year of her intromiſſion, is but L. 129
and ſome odd ſhillings, whereas the Factor's rental is L. 164.</p>
            <p>And, upon the whole, the Petitioner concludes, that there
is no good exception againſt the juſtice of the Decreet-arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral,
and that there is no relevant ground in law for reducing
this Submiſſion, and that iniquity is no relevant ground for
reducing the Decreet-arbitral. The Reſpondent apprehends,
that he has much better ground to ſay, that the Decreet-arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
is in every particular iniquous, and that whether it was
iniquous or not, he is founded in law to reduce the Submiſſion,
the ſigning of which was elicit from him and his Brother
<hi>metu carceris;</hi> and that the petitioner, by her extraordinary,
illegal and unwarrantable management of her huſband and
childrens affairs, has occaſioned difficulties, and probably loſs,
which may not be eaſily recovered from her, and ſhe in the
mean time is quietly in poſſeſſion of 1100 merks free of public
burdens, tho' ſhe has only now two of her ſix children with
her, while the Reſpondent, the heir, has not a farthing of his
Father's effects to live upon, which he hopes will merit the
conſideration of the Court.</p>
