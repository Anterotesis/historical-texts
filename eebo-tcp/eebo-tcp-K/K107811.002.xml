            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
               <p>THE materials that form the Firſt Part of the following Poem are taken from the Scandinavian poetics, The EDDA! In the remarks on the third fable of the Edda, are theſe words, <q>A powerful Being had with his breath animated the drops out of which the firſt giant was formed. This Being, whom the Edda affects not to name, was entirely diſtinct from Odin, who had his birth long after the formation of the giant Ymir.</q>—This firſt agent, or Genius, whom the Edda affects not to name, is ſuppoſed, in the following Poem, to create, from his own immediate power, the ſyſtem of the Scaldic mythology. As it would have been impoſſible to introduce the whole ſyſtem without running into a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious enumeration, the principal features of it are only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ſufficient (it is preſumed) to give ſome idea of the character of the northern poetry. Among other omiſſions, the reader will find that no mention is made of <hi>Gimlé,</hi> the manſion of bliſs, that was appropriated to the reception of the virtuous, nor of <hi>Naſtrande,</hi> the abode of the impious; theſe places not being ſuppoſed to exiſt in their full extent till the general deſtruction of the world; whereas the hall of Odin, and the caves of Hela, were peculiarly the Elyſium and the Tartarus of the Runic poetry: they are perpetually referred to in the ancient ſongs of the Scalds, and the wild ſyſtem of theſe contraſted abodes ſeems well calculated to encourage
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0087601102:43"/>that ſpirit of war and enterprize which runs through the whole Scandinavian minſtrelſy.</p>
               <p>Some expreſſions taken from the Edda may appear obſcure without an explanation.—In the language of the Scalds, the world is ſtiled the great veſſel that floats on the ages.—The rainbow, the bridge of the gods.—To drink the blood of friendſhip, alludes to a ceremony performed by two warriors when they enter into an alliance of friendſhip; they made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions in their arms or breaſt, and taſting each other's blood, they mutually ſwore, that the death of the firſt of them who fell in battle ſhould not paſs unrevenged.</p>
               <p>To celebrate the maſs of weapons, was to fight againſt the Chriſtians, whoſe religious ſentiments the Scandavians held in contempt, as thinking them adverſe to the ſpirit of war.</p>
               <p>The Valkeries are a female troop, whom Odin ſends to the field of battle upon inviſible ſteeds; their function is to chooſe ſuch as are deſtined to ſlaughter, and conduct their ſpirits to the Paradiſe of the Brave.</p>
               <p>Fenris is a large wolf, who is to break his chains at the general conflagration, and to ſwallow the ſun.</p>

               <p>THE Monaſtery of CLUNI, from whence ABELARD is ſuppoſed to write the following Epiſtle, was founded in the year 611, near the village of Maſcon, on the river Graone. The Head of this convent (in the time of ABELARD) was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed for his learning and humanity. Hiſtory elevates him above the vulgar herd of monks, by the appellation of the Venerable PETER! He extended his generous protection to the unfortunate ABELARD, when he was under the cenſure of the court of Rome.</p>
               <p>SAINT BERNARD alſo is connected with the ſtory of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclete. This great man ſtands eminently forward in the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the twelfth century: Born with a mind too reſtleſs and enterpriſing to be confined within the circle of monaſtic occupations, he ruſhed into the tumult of active life, and took the lead in ſome of the moſt important tranſactions of that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. With an undiſciplined ardour peculiar to his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, he precipitated his country into that ruinous meaſure, the ſecond cruſade. Behold him at another time haſtening to the conteſt that held all EUROPE in ſuſpence, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited two contending candidates for the popedom. The authority and vehemence of BERNARD overpowered the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of ANACLETUS, and INNOCENT was ſeated on the papal throne. The enemies of this celebrated Abbot ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver impeached his moral character; but it muſt be allowal
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0087601102:73"/>that in his zeal againſt the innovation of new opinions, he has ſometimes left unregarded the ſuperior duty of charity. A letter of his to the Cardinal GUIDO, the pope's legate in France, contains the moſt intolerant and ſanguinary counſel.</p>
               <p>ABELARD in the following Epiſtle lays a conſiderable ſtreſs upon his ſentence of excommunication: In the dark ages, that ſpiritual humiliation was felt as the greateſt cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; the relation, the parent, the lover, the friend, ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their endearing offices, and withdrew from the degraded offender.</p>
               <p>THE following Poem has been diſtinguiſhed by a beautiful ſonnet, inſerted in a volume of Poems that does honour to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera poetry, by Mr. Taylor, a gentleman whoſe commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a paſſport to Fame, except where it is directed (as in the preſent intlance) by the amiable bias of friendſhip.</p>

               <p>The following little Drama was written for (that ornament of the Stage) Mrs. POPE, who performed it on the night of her benefit. This Interlude has alſo been performed at BRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENBURGH Houſe: the part of MARGARET received from the theatrical abilities of her Serene Highneſs the Margravine the richeſt colouring and the moſt impreſſive truth of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
               <p>The ſubject is taken from a remarkable incident in the life of MARGARET.—That unfortunate Queen, flying with her Son into a foreſt after the battle of HEXHAM, ſaw a Robber approach with his naked ſword; and finding that ſhe had no means of eſcaping, ſhe ſuddenly embraced the reſolution of truſting entirely for protection to his generoſity. The man,
