            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is ſcarcely poſſible that any one ſhould entertain a more humble opinion of the following little Production, than ſhe who preſents it to you. It is a trifle which, ſhe confeſſes, has but a very ſlender claim to your protection; but ſhe conſiders that your Name will be an ornament to her Book, as your Friendſhip has been an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to its Author.</p>
            <p>Where merit is inconteſtible, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters are decided by the concurring ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of mankind, praiſe becomes almoſt impertinent. It is abſurd to be induſtrious in proving truths ſo ſelf-evident, that no one ever thought of controverting them.</p>
            <p>I may be accuſed of advancing a ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling propoſition, when I declare that you are an enemy to the Muſes; but if it be allowed that deſcription and invention are
<pb facs="tcp:0118704500:3"/>
the very ſoul of Poetry, I ſhall be juſtified by the world in general, who conſtantly behold you diſplaying talents which cannot be deſcribed, and exhibiting excellencies which leave nothing to be imagined.</p>
            <p>Whatever reaſon I may find to regret my having ventured theſe little Poems in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, I ſhall at leaſt have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pleaſure in recollecting one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance attending them, ſince they furniſh me with an occaſion of aſſuring you with what eſteem and admiration I am,</p>

               <l>Yet early was ſhe doom'd the child of care,</l>
               <l>For love, ill-fated love ſubdued the fair.</l>

               <l>Young POLYDORE, the pride of rural ſwains,</l>
               <l>Was wont to viſit <hi>Belmont</hi>'s blooming plains.</l>

               <l>Th' unerring dart to wound the flying doe?</l>
               <l>How leave the ſwifteſt at the race behind,</l>

               <l>Breathe the ſoft flute, or ſtrike the louder lyre?</l>
               <l>From that fam'd lyre no vulgar muſic ſprung,</l>

               <l>The ſocial ſweetneſs, and the ſylvan ſong;</l>
               <l>He taught, fair Wiſdom in her grove to woo,</l>

               <l>The ſavage herds in mute attention ſtood,</l>

               <l>Young POLYDORE was rich in large domains.</l>

               <l>An hapleſs victim thus I had not died:</l>
               <l>If there be gods, and gods there ſurely are,</l>
               <l>lnſulted virtue doubtleſs is their care.</l>
               <l>Then haſten, righteous Heaven ! my tedious fate,</l>
               <l>Shorten my woes, and end my mortal date:</l>
               <l>Quick let your power transform this failing frame,</l>
               <l>Let me be any thing but what I am !</l>
               <l>And ſince the cruel woes I'm doom'd to feel,</l>
               <l>Proceed, alas ! from having lov'd too well;</l>
               <l>Grant me ſome form where love can have no part,</l>
               <l>Nor human weakneſs reach my guarded heart:</l>
               <l>If pity has not left your bleſt abodes,</l>
               <l>Change me to flinty adamant, ye Gods;</l>
               <l>To hardeſt rock, or monumental ſtone,</l>
               <l>Rather than let me know the pangs I've known:</l>
               <l>So ſhall I thus no farther torments prove,</l>
               <l>Nor taunting rivals ſay, ' ſhe died for love.</l>
               <l>For ſure if aught can aggravate our fate,</l>
               <l>'Tis ſcorn, or pity from the breaſt we hate."</l>

               <l>Now, ſtrange to tell! if rural folks ſay true,</l>
               <l>To harden'd Rock the ſtiffening damſel grew;</l>
               <l>No more her ſhapeleſs features can be known,</l>
               <l>Stone is her body, and her limbs are ſtone;</l>
               <l>The growing Rock invades her beauteous face,</l>
               <l>And quickly petrifies each living grace;</l>
               <l>The ſtone her ſtature nor her ſhape retains,</l>
               <l>The nymph is vaniſh'd, but the Rock remains;</l>
               <l>Yet wou'd her heart its vital ſpirits keep,</l>
               <l>And ſcom'd to mingle with the marble heap.</l>

               <l>And, "Take, ſweet maid,"he cried, "my parting groan."</l>
               <l>Fainting, the ſteel he graſp'd, and as he fell,</l>
               <l>The weapon pierc'd the Rock he lov'd ſo well;</l>
               <l>The guiltleſs ſteel aſſail'd the mortal part,</l>
