            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH, M.B.<note n="*" place="bottom">In theſe Memoirs, which were publiſhed in London, ſoon after the death of Dr. Goldſmith, were ſeveral miſtakes, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to our author's age, the time of his admiſſion into the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Dublin, &amp;c. which are here corrected from accurate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note>
            </head>
            <p>OLIVER GOLDSMITH, ſon of the Reverend Charles Goldſmith, was born at Elphin, in the county of Roſcommon in Ireland, in the year 1729. His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had four ſons, of whom Oliver was the third. After being well inſtructed in the claſſics, at the ſchool of Mr. Hughes, he was admitted a ſizer in
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0110502800:4"/>
Trinity-college, Dublin, on the 11th of June, 1744. While he reſided there, he exhibited no ſpecimens of that genius, which, in his maturer years, raiſed his character ſo high. On the 27th of February, 1749, O. S. (two years after the regular time) he obtained the degree of Bachelor of Arts. Soon after, he turned his thoughts to the profeſſion of phyſic; and, after attending ſome courſes of anatomy in Dublin, proceeded to Edinburgh, in the year 1751, where he ſtudied the ſeveral branches of medicine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the different profeſſors in that univerſity. His beneficent diſpoſition ſoon involved him in unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected difficulties; and he was obliged precipitately to leave Scotland, in conſequence of having engaged himſelf to pay a conſiderable ſum of money for a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſtudent.</p>
            <p>A FEW days after, about the beginning of the year 1754, he arrived at Sunderland, near Newcaſtle, where he was arreſted at the ſuit of one Barclay, a taylor in Edinburgh, to whom he had given ſecurity for his friend. By the friendſhip of Mr. Laughlin Maclane and Dr. Sleigh, who were then in the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, he was ſoon delivered out of the hands of the bailiff, and took his paſſage on board a Dutch ſhip to Rotterdam, where, after a ſhort ſtay, he proceeded to Bruſſels. He then viſited great part of Flanders; and, after paſſing ſome time at Straſbourg and Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain, where he obtained a degree of Bachelor in phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, he accompanied an Engliſh gentleman to Geneva.</p>
            <p>IT is undoubtedly fact, that this ingenious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate man made moſt part of his tour on

               </note> He had left England with very little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and, being of a philoſophical turn, and at that time poſſeſſing a body capable of ſuſtaining every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, and a heart not eaſily terrified by danger, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an enthuſiaſt to the deſign he had formed of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manners of different countries. He had ſome knowledge of the French language, and of muſic; he played tolerably well on the German flute; which, from an amuſement, became at ſome times the means of ſubſiſtence. His learning produced him an hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table reception at moſt of the religious houſes that he viſited; and his muſic made him welcome to the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants of Flanders and Germany. <q rend="inline">'Whenever I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached a peaſant's houſe towards night-fall,'</q> he uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">'I played one of my moſt merry tunes, and that generally procured me not only a lodging, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence for the next day: but <hi>in truth</hi>'</q> (his conſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion) <q rend="inline">'I muſt own, whenever I attempted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain perſons of a higher rank, they always thought my performance odious, and never made me any return for my endeavours to pleaſe them.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>ON his arrival at Geneva, he was recommended as a proper perſon for a travelling tutor to a young man, who had been unexpectedly left a conſiderable ſum of money by his uncle Mr. S******. This youth, who was articled to an attorney, on receipt of his fortune determined to ſee the world; and, on his engaging with his preceptor, made a proviſo, that he
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0110502800:6"/>
ſhould be permitted to govern himſelf: and our travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſoon found his pupil underſtood the art of direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in money concerns extremely well, as avarice was his prevailing paſſion.</p>
            <p>DURING Goldſmith's continuance in Switzerland, he aſſiduouſly cultivated his poetical talent, of which he had given ſome ſtriking proofs at the college of Edinburgh. It was from hence he ſent the firſt ſketch of his delightful epiſtle, called the <hi>Traveller,</hi> to his brother Henry, a clergyman in Ireland.</p>
            <p>FROM Geneva Mr. Goldſmith and his pupil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the ſouth of France, where the young man, upon ſome diſagreement with his preceptor, paid him the ſmall part of his ſalary which was due, and embarked at Marſeilles for England. Our wanderer was left once more upon the world at large, and paſſed through a number of difficulties in traverſing the greateſt part of France. At length his curioſity being gratified, he bent his courſe towards England, and arrived at Dover, the beginning of the winter, in the year 1758.</p>
            <p>HIS finances were ſo low on his return to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that he with difficulty got to the metropolis, his whole ſtock of caſh amounting to no more than a few halfpence! An entire ſtranger in London, his mind was filled with the moſt gloomy reflections in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his embarraſſed ſituation! He applied to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral apothecaries in hopes of being received in the capacity of a journeyman, but his broad Iriſh accent, and the uncouthneſs of his appearance, occaſioned him to meet with inſult from moſt of the medicinal tribe. The next day, however, a chymiſt near Fiſh-ſtreet,
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0110502800:7"/>
ſtruck with his forlorn condition, and the ſimplicity of his manner, took him into his laboratory, where he continued till he diſcovered that his old friend Dr. Sleigh was in London. That gentleman received him with the warmeſt affection, and liberally invited him to ſhare his purſe till ſome eſtabliſhment could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for him. Goldſmith, unwilling to be a burden to his friend, a ſhort time after eagerly embraced an offer which was made him to aſſiſt the late Rev. Dr. Milner, in inſtructing the young gentlemen at the Academy at Peckham; and acquitted himſelf greatly to the Doctor's ſatisfaction for a ſhort time; but, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtained ſome reputation by the criticiſms he had written in the Monthly Review, Mr. Griffith, the principal proprietor, engaged him in the compilation of it; and, reſolving to purſue the profeſſion of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he returned to London, as the mart where abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of every kind were ſure of meeting diſtinction and reward. Here he determined to adopt a plan of the ſtricteſt oeconomy, and, at the cloſe of the year 1759, took lodgings in Green-Arbour-court in the Old Bailey, where he wrote ſeveral ingenious pieces. The late Mr. Newbery, who, at that time gave great encouragement to men of literary abilities, became a kind of patron to our young author, and introduced him as one of the writers in the Public Ledger, in which his <hi>Citizen of the World</hi> originally appeared, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of 'Chineſe Letters.'<note n="*" place="bottom">During this time, (according to another account) he wrote for the Britiſh Magazine, of which Dr. Smollet was then Editor, moſt of thoſe <hi>Eſſays</hi> and <hi>Tales,</hi> which he afterwards collected and publiſhed in a ſeparate volume. He alſo wrote occaſionally, for the Critical Review; and it was the merit which he diſcovered in criticiſing a deſpicable tranſlation of Ovid's <hi>Faſti</hi> by a pedantic ſchool-maſter, and his <hi>Enquiry into the preſent ſtate of learning in Europe,</hi> which firſt introduced him to the acquaintance of Dr. Smollet, who recommended him to ſeveral literati, and to moſt of the bookſellers by whom he was afterwards patronized.</note>

               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0110502800:8"/>
FORTUNE now ſeemed to take ſome notice of a man ſhe had long neglected. The ſimplicity of his character, the integrity of his heart, and the merit of his productions, made his company very acceptable to a number of reſpectable perſons; and, about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the year 1762, he emerged from his mean apartments near the Old Bailey to the politer air of the Temple, where he took handſome chambers, and lived in a genteel ſtyle. The publication of his <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,</hi> his <hi>Vicar of Wakefield,</hi> and his <hi>Hiſtory of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was followed by the performance of his comedy of <hi>the Good natured Man</hi> at Covent Garden theatre, and placed him in the firſt rank of the poets of the preſent age.</p>
            <p>OUR Doctor, as he was now univerſally called, had a conſtant levee of his diſtreſt countrymen, whoſe wants, as far as he was able, he always relieved; and he has been often known to leave himſelf even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a guinea, in order to ſupply the neceſſities of others.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER feature in his character we cannot help laying before the reader. Previous to the publication of his <hi>Deſerted Village,</hi> the bookſeller had given him a note for one hundred guineas for the copy, which the Doctor mentioned, a few hours after, to one of his friends, who obſerved it was a very great ſum for ſo ſhort a performance. <q rend="inline">'In truth,'</q> replied Goldſmith, <q rend="inline">'I think ſo too, it is much more than the honeſt man can afford, or the piece is worth; I have not been

eaſy ſince I received it; I will therefore go back and return him his note:'</q> which he actually did, and left it entirely to the bookſeller to pay him according to the profits produced by the ſale of the poem, which turned out very conſiderable.</p>
            <p>DURING the laſt rehearſal of his comedy, intitled, <hi>She ſtoops to Conquer,</hi> which Mr. Coleman thought would not ſucceed, on the Doctor's objecting to the repetition of one of Tony Lumpkin's ſpeeches, being apprehenſive it might injure the play, the Manager, with great keenneſs replied, <q rend="inline">'Pſha, my dear Doctor, do not be fearful of <hi>ſquibs,</hi> when we have been ſitting almoſt theſe two hours upon a <hi>barrel of gunpowder.</hi>'</q> The piece, however, contrary to Mr. Coleman's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, was received with uncommon applauſe by the audience; and Goldſmith's pride was ſo hurt by the ſeverity of the above obſervation, that it entirely put an end to his friendſhip for the gentleman who made it.</p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the great ſucceſs of his pieces, by ſome of which, it is aſſerted, upon good authority, he cleared 1800 l. in one year, his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances were by no means in a proſperous ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! partly owing to the liberality of his diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and partly to an unfortunate habit he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted of gaming, with the arts of which he was very little acquainted, and conſequently became the prey of thoſe who were unprincipled enough to take advantage of his ignorance.</p>
            <p>JUST before his death he had formed a deſign for executing an univerſal dictionary of arts and ſciences,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0110502800:10"/>
the <hi>proſpectus</hi> of which he actually printed and diſtributed among his acquaintance. In this work ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his literary friends (particularly Sir Joſhua Reynolds, Dr. Johnſon, Mr. Beauclerc, and Mr. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick) had promiſed to aſſiſt, and to furniſh him with articles upon different ſubjects. He had entertained the moſt ſanguine expectations from the ſucceſs of it. The undertaking, however, did not meet with that encouragement from the bookſellers which he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined it would undoubtedly receive; and he uſed to lament this circumſtance almoſt to the laſt hour of his exiſtence.</p>
            <p>HE had been for ſome years afflicted, at different times, with a violent ſtrangury, which contributed not a little to imbitter the latter part of his life; and which, united with the vexations he ſuffered upon other occaſions, brought on a kind of habitual deſpondency. In this unhappy condition he was attacked by a nervous fever, which, being improperly treated, terminated in his diſſolution on the 4th day of April, 1774, in the forty-fifth year of his age. His friends, who were very numerous and reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, had determined to bury him in Weſtminſter-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, where a tablet was to have been erected to his memory. His pall was to have been ſupported by Lord Shelburne, Lord Louth, Sir Joſhua Reynolds, the Hon. Mr. Beauclerc, Mr. Edmond Burke, and Mr. Garrick; but from ſome unaccountable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances this deſign was dropped, and his remains were privately depoſited in the Temple burial-ground.<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſubſcription, however, has ſince been raiſed by his friends, to defray the expence of a marble monument which is now executed by Mr. Nollikens, an eminent Statuary in London, and is ſhortly to be placed in Weſtminſter-abbey, with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſcription, written by Dr. Samuel Johnſon.

AS to his character, it is ſtrongly illuſtrated by Mr. Pope's line,

            <p>THE learned leiſure he loved to enjoy was too often interrupted by diſtreſſes which aroſe from the openneſs of his temper, and which ſometimes threw him into loud fits of paſſion; but this impetuoſity was corrected upon a moment's reflection, and his ſervants have been known, upon theſe occaſions, purpoſely to throw themſelves in his way, that they might profit by it immediately after; for he who had the good fortune to be reproved was certain of being rewarded for it. His diſappointments at other times, made him peeviſh and ſullen, and he has often left a party of convivial friends abruptly in the evening,
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0110502800:12"/>
in order to go home and brood over his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
            <p>THE univerſal eſteem in which his poems are held, and the repeated pleaſure they give in the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, are ſtriking proofs of their merit. He was a ſtudious and correct obſerver of nature, happy in the ſelection of his images, in the choice of his ſubjects, and in the harmony of his verſification; and, though his embarraſſed ſituation prevented him from putting the laſt hand to many of his productions, his <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi> his <hi>Traveller,</hi> and his <hi>Deſerted Village,</hi> bid fair to claim a place among the moſt finiſhed pieces in the Engliſh language.</p>
            <p>AS different accounts have been given of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious man, the writer of <hi>theſe</hi> anecdotes cannot conclude without declaring, that they are all found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon facts, and collected by one who lived with him upon the moſt friendly footing for a great number of years, and who never felt any ſorrow more ſenſibly than that which was occaſioned by his death.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>AS there is nothing I diſlike ſo much as news-paper controverſy, particularly upon trifles, permit me to be as conciſe as poſſible in informing a correſpondent of yours, that I recommended Blainville's Travels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I thought the book was a good one; and I think ſo ſtill. I ſaid, I was told by the bookſeller that it was then firſt publiſhed; but in that, it ſeems, I was miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and my reading was not extenſive enough to ſet me right.</p>
                  <p>Another correſpondent of yours accuſes me of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken a ballad, I publiſhed ſome time ago, from one <note n="*" place="bottom">The Friar of Orders Gray.—<hi>Reliq. of Anc. Poetry,</hi> vol. 1, p. 243.</note> by the ingenious Mr. Percy. I do not think there is any great reſemblance between the two pieces
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0110502800:26"/>
in queſtion. If there be any, his ballad is taken from mine. I read it to Mr. Percy, ſome years ago; and he (as we both conſidered theſe things as trifles at beſt) told me, with his uſual good humour, the next time I ſaw him, that he had taken my plan to form the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Shakeſpeare into a ballad of his own. He then read me his little Cento, if I may ſo call it, and I highly approved it. Such petty anecdotes as theſe are ſcarce worth printing: and, were it not for the buſy diſpoſition of ſome of your correſpondents, the public ſhould never have known that he owes me the hint of his ballad, or that I am obliged to his friendſhip and learning for communications of a much more important nature.</p>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM ſenſible that the friendſhip between us can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no new force from the ceremonies of a Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and perhaps it demands an excuſe thus to prefix your name to my attempts, which you decline giving with your own. But as a part of this Poem was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly written to you from Switzerland, the whole can now, with propriety, be only inſcribed to you. It will alſo throw a light upon many parts of it, when the reader underſtands, that it is addreſſed to a man, who, deſpiſing Fame and Fortune, has retired early to Happineſs and Obſcurity, with an income of forty pounds a year.</p>
                  <p>I now perceive, my dear brother, the wiſdom of your humble choice. You have entered upon a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred office, where the harveſt is great, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers are but few; while you have left the field of Ambition, where the labourers are many, and the harveſt not worth carrying away. But of all kinds of ambition, what from the refinement of the times, from different ſyſtems of criticiſm, and from the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0110502800:39"/>
diviſions of party, that which purſues poetical fame is the wildeſt.</p>
                  <p>Poetry makes a principal amuſement among unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed nations; but in a country verging to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes of refinement, Painting and Muſic come in for a ſhare. As theſe offer the feeble mind a leſs labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous entertainment, they at firſt rival Poetry, and at length ſupplant her; they engroſs all that favour once ſhewn to her, and though but younger ſiſters, ſeize upon the elder's birth-right.</p>
                  <p>Yet, however this art may be neglected by the powerful, it is ſtill in greater danger from the miſtaken efforts of the learned to improve it. What criticiſms have we not heard of late in favour of blank verſe, and Pindaric odes, choruſſes, anapeſts and iambics, alliterative care and happy negligence! Every abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity has now a champion to defend it, and as he is generally much in the wrong, ſo he has always much to ſay; for error is ever talkative.</p>
                  <p>But there is an enemy to this art ſtill more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I mean Party. Party entirely diſtorts the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deſtroys the taſte. When the mind is once infected with this diſeaſe, it can only find pleaſure in what contributes to increaſe the diſtemper. Like the tyger, that ſeldom deſiſts from purſuing man after having once preyed upon human fleſh, the reader, who has once gratified his appetite with calumny, makes, ever after, the moſt agreeable feaſt upon mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered reputation. Such readers generally admire ſome half-witted thing, who wants to be thought a bold man, having loſt the character of a wiſe one. Him they dignify with the name of poet; his tawdry
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0110502800:40"/>
lampoons are called ſatires, his turbulence is ſaid to be force, and his phrenzy fire.</p>
                  <p>What reception a Poem may find, which has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abuſe, party, nor blank verſe to ſupport it, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, nor am I ſolicitous to know. My aims are right. Without eſpouſing the cauſe of any party, I have attempted to moderate the rage of all. I have endeavoured to ſhew, that there may be equal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſtates, that are differently governed from our own; that every ſtate has a particular principle of happineſs, and that this principle in each may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a miſchievous exceſs. There are few can judge, better than yourſelf, how far theſe poſitions are illuſtrated in this Poem. I am,</p>

                  <p>I CAN have no expectations in an addreſs of this kind, either to add to your reputation, or to eſtabliſh my own. You can gain nothing from my admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I am ignorant of that art in which you are ſaid to excel; and I may loſe much by the ſeverity of your judgment, as few have a juſter taſte in poetry than you. Setting intereſt therefore aſide, to which I never paid much attention, I muſt be indulged at preſent in following my affections. The only dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation I ever made was to my brother, becauſe I lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him better than moſt other men. He is ſince dead. Permit me to inſcribe this poem to you.</p>
                  <p>How far you may be pleaſed with the verſification and meer mechanical parts of this attempt, I don't pretend to inquire; but I know you will object (and indeed ſeveral of our beſt and wiſeſt friends concur in the opinion) that the depopulation it deplores is no where to be ſeen, and the diſorders it laments are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found in the poet's own imagination. To this I can ſcarce make any other anſwer than that I ſincerely believe what I have written; that I have taken all poſſible pains, in my country excurſions, for

theſe four or five years paſt, to be certain of what I allege, and that all my views and inquiries have led me to believe thoſe miſeries real, which I here at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to diſplay. But this is not the place to enter into an inquiry, whether the country be depopulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or not; the diſcuſſion would take up much room, and I ſhould prove myſelf, at beſt, an indifferent poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, to tire the reader with a long preface, when I want his unfatigued attention to a long poem:</p>
                  <p>In regretting the depopulation of the country, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh againſt the increaſe of our luxuries; and here alſo I expect the ſhout of modern politicians againſt me. For twenty or thirty years paſt, it has been the faſhion to conſider luxury as one of the greateſt nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal advantages; and all the wiſdom of antiquity in that particular, as erroneous. Still, however, I muſt remain a profeſſed ancient on that head, and continue to think thoſe luxuries prejudicial to ſtates, by which ſo many vices are introduced, and ſo many kingdoms have been undone. Indeed ſo much has been poured out of late on the other ſide of the queſtion, that, meerly for the ſake of novelty and variety, one would ſometimes wiſh to be in the right. I am,</p>

                     <l>When toil remitting lent its turn to play,</l>
                     <l>And all the village train, from labour free,</l>
                     <l>Led up their ſports beneath the ſpreading tree,</l>
                     <l>While many a paſtime circled in the ſhade,</l>
                     <l>The young contending as the old ſurvey'd;</l>

                  <l>What if I give a maſquerade?—I will.</l>
                  <l>But how? ay, there's the rub! <stage>[pauſing]</stage> —I've got my cue:</l>

                  <l>The haunch was a picture for painters to ſtudy,</l>
                  <l>The fat was ſo white, and the lean was ſo ruddy,</l>

                  <l>To ſpoil ſuch a delicate picture by eating;</l>
                  <l>I had thoughts, in my chambers, to place it in view,</l>
                  <l>To be ſhewn to my friends as a piece of virtu:</l>
                  <l>As in ſome Iriſh houſes, where things are ſo ſo,</l>
                  <l>One gammon of bacon hangs up for a ſhow:</l>
                  <l>But, for eating a raſher of what they take pride in,</l>
                  <l>They'd as ſoon think of eating the pan it is fry'd in.</l>

But hold—let me pauſe—don't I hear you pronounce,</l>
                  <l>This tale of the bacon's a damnable bounce;</l>
                  <l>Well, ſuppoſe it a bounce—ſure a poet may try,</l>
                  <l>By a bounce now and then, to get courage to fly.</l>

                  </l>
                  <l>To go on with my tale—as I gaz'd on the haunch;</l>
                  <l>I thought of a friend that was truſty and ſtaunch,</l>
                  <l>So I cut it, and ſent it to Reynolds undreſt,</l>
                  <l>To paint it, or eat it, juſt as he lik'd beſt.</l>
                  <l>Of the neck and the breaſt I had next to diſpoſe;</l>
                  <l>'Twas a neck and a breaſt that might rival Monroe's:</l>
                  <l>But in parting with theſe I was puzzled again,</l>
                  <l>With the how, and the who, and the where, and the when.</l>
                  <l>There's H—d, and C—y, and H—rth, and H—ff,</l>
                  <l>I think they love veniſon—I know they love beef.</l>
                  <l>There's my countryman Higgins—Oh! let him alone,</l>
                  <l>For making a blunder, or picking a bone.</l>
                  <l>But hang it—to poets who ſeldom can eat,</l>
                  <l>Your very good mutton's a very good treat;</l>
                  <l>Such dainties to them their health it might hurt,</l>
                  <l>It's like ſending them ruffles, when wanting a ſhirt.</l>
                  <l>While thus I debated, in reverie center'd,</l>
                  <l>An acquaintance, a friend as he call'd himſelf, enter'd;</l>
                  <l>An under-bred, fine-ſpoken fellow was he,</l>

                  <l>Why whoſe ſhould it be? cried I, with a flounce,</l>

Some lords, my acquaintance, that ſettle the nation,</l>
                  <l>Are pleas'd to be kind—but I hate oſtentation.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>If that be the caſe then, cried he, very gay,</l>
                  <l>I'm glad I have taken this houſe in my way.</l>
                  <l>To-morrow you take a poor dinner with me;</l>
                  <l>No words—I inſiſt on't—preciſely at three:</l>
                  <l>We'll have Johnſon, and Burke, all the wits will be there,</l>
                  <l>My acquaintance is ſlight, or I'd aſk my lord Clare.</l>
                  <l>And, now that I think on't, as I am a ſinner!</l>
                  <l>We wanted this veniſon to make out the dinner.</l>
                  <l>What ſay you—a paſty, it ſhall, and it muſt,</l>
                  <l>And my wife, little Kitty, is famous for cruſt.</l>
                  <l>Here, porter—this veniſon with me to Mile-end;</l>
                  <l>No ſtirring—I beg—my dear friend—my dear friend!</l>
                  <l>Thus ſnatching his hat, he bruſht off like the wind,</l>
                  <l>And the porter and eatables follow'd behind.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Left alone to reflect, having emptied my ſhelf,</l>

                  </l>
                  <l>Tho' I could not help thinking my gentleman haſty,</l>
                  <l>Yet Johnſon, and Burke, and a good veniſon paſty,</l>
                  <l>Were things that I never diſliked in my life,</l>
                  <l>Tho' clogg'd with a coxcomb, and Kitty his wife.</l>
                  <l>So next day in due ſplendor to make my approach,</l>
                  <l>I drove to his door in my own hackney-coach.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>When come to the place where we all were to dine,</l>
                  <l>(A chair-lumber'd cloſet juſt twelve feet by nine:)</l>

My friend bade me welcome, but ſtruck me quite dumb,</l>
                  <l>With tidings that Johnſon, and Burke would not come,</l>
                  <l>For I knew it, he cried, both eternally fail,</l>
                  <l>The one with his ſpeeches, and t'other with Thrale;</l>
                  <l>But no matter, I'll warrant we'll make up the party,</l>
                  <l>With two full as clever, and ten times as hearty.</l>
                  <l>The one is a Scotchman, the other a Jew,</l>
                  <l>They both of them merry, and authors like you;</l>
                  <l>The one writes the Snarler, the other the Scourge;</l>
                  <l>Some thinks he writes Cinna—he owns to Panurge.</l>
                  <l>While thus he deſcrib'd them by trade and by name,</l>
                  <l>They enter'd, and dinner was ſerv'd as they came.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>At the top a fried liver, and bacon were ſeen,</l>
                  <l>At the bottom was tripe, in a ſwinging tureen;</l>
                  <l>At the ſides there was ſpinnage and pudding made hot;</l>
                  <l>In the middle a place where the paſty—was not.</l>
                  <l>Now, my lord, as for tripe it's my utter averſion,</l>
                  <l>And your bacon I hate like a Turk or a Perſian;</l>
                  <l>So there I ſat ſtuck, like a horſe in a pound,</l>
                  <l>While the bacon and liver went merrily round:</l>
                  <l>But what vex'd me moſt, was that d—'d Scottiſh rogue,</l>
                  <l>With his long-winded ſpeeches, his ſmiles and his brogue,</l>
                  <l>And, madam, quoth he, may this bit be my poiſon,</l>
                  <l>A prettier dinner I never ſet eyes on;</l>
                  <l>Pray a ſlice of your liver, tho' may I be curſt,</l>
                  <l>But I've eat of your tripe, till I'm ready to burſt.</l>
                  <l>The tripe, quoth the Jew, with his chocolate cheek,</l>
                  <l>I could dine on this tripe ſeven days in the week:</l>
                  <l>I like theſe here dinners ſo pretty and ſmall;</l>
                  <l>But your friend there, the-doctor, eats nothing at all.</l>
                  <l>O—oh! quoth my friend, he'll come on in a trice,</l>
                  <l>He's keeping a corner for ſomething that's nice:</l>

There's a paſty—a paſty! repeated the Jew;</l>
                  <l>I don't care, if I keep a corner for't too.</l>
                  <l>What the de'il, mon, a paſty! re-echo'd the Scot;</l>
                  <l>Though ſplitting, I'll ſtill keep a corner for that.</l>

                  <l>We'll all keep a corner was echo'd about.</l>
                  <l>While thus we reſolv'd, and the paſty delay'd,</l>
                  <l>With looks that quite petrified, enter'd the maid;</l>
                  <l>A viſage ſo ſad, and ſo pale with affright,</l>
                  <l>Wak'd Priam in drawing his curtains by night.</l>
                  <l>But we quickly found out, for who could miſtake her?</l>
                  <l>That ſhe came with ſome terrible news from the baker:</l>
                  <l>And ſo it fell out, for that negligent ſloven,</l>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>WHEN I undertook to write a comedy, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I was ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed in favour of the poets of the laſt age, and ſtrove to imitate them. The term, genteel comedy, was then unknown amongſt us, and little more was deſired by an audience, than nature and humour, in whatever walks of life they were moſt conſpicuous. The author of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcenes never imagined that more would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of him, and therefore to delineate character has been his principal aim. Thoſe who know any thing of compoſition, are ſenſible, that in purſuing humour, it will ſometimes lead us into the receſſes of the mean; I was even tempted to look for it in the maſter of a ſpunging-houſe: but in deference to the public taſte, grown of late, perhaps, too delicate; the ſcene of the bailiffs was retrenched in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation. In deference alſo to the judgment of a few friends, who think in a particular way, the ſcene is here reſtored. The author ſubmits it to the reader in his cloſet; and hopes that too much refinement will not baniſh humour and character from ours, as it has already done from the French theatre. Indeed the French comedy is now become ſo very elevated and ſentimental, that it has not only baniſhed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and Moliere from the ſtage, but it has baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all ſpectators too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0110502800:101"/>
Upon the whole, the author returns his thanks to the public for the favourable reception which the Good-Natur'd Man has met with: and to Mr. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in particular, for his kindneſs to it. It may not alſo be improper to aſſure any, who ſhall hereafter write for the theatre, that merit, or ſuppoſed merit, will ever be a ſufficient paſſport to his protection.</p>

                        <p>What ſignifies his affection to me; or how can I be proud of a place in a heart where every ſharper and coxcomb find an eaſy entrance?</p>

                        <p>I grant you that he's rather too good-natur'd; that he's too much every man's man; that he laughs this minute with one, and cries the next with another; but whoſe inſtructions may he thank for all this?</p>

                        <p>Not mine, ſure? My letters to him during my em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in Italy, taught him only that philoſophy which might prevent, not defend his errors.</p>

                     <sp>

                        <p>Faith, begging your honour's pardon, I'm ſorry they taught him any philoſophy at all; it has only ſerv'd to ſpoil him. This ſame philoſophy is a good horſe in the ſtable, but an errant jade on a journey. For my own part, whenever I hear him mention the name on't, I'm always ſure he's going to play the fool.</p>

                        <p>Don't let us aſcribe his faults to his philoſophy, I entreat you. No, Jarvis, his good nature ariſes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from his fears of offending the importunate, than his deſire of making the deſerving happy.</p>

                        <p>Ay, or that does not aſk it. I have been now for ſome time a concealed ſpectator of his follies, and find them as boundleſs as his diſſipation.</p>

                        <p>And yet, faith, he has ſome fine name or other for them all. He calls his extravagance, generoſity; and his truſting every body, univerſal benevolence. It was but laſt week he went ſecurity for a fellow whoſe face he ſcarce knew, and that he called an act of exalted mu—mu—munificence; ay, that was the name he gave it.</p>

                        <p>And upon that I proceed, as my laſt effort, tho' with very little hopes to reclaim him. That very fellow has juſt abſconded, and I have taken up the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. Now, my intention is to involve him in fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious diſtreſs, before he has plunged himſelf into real calamity. To arreſt him for that very debt, to clap an officer upon him, and then let him ſee which of his friends will come to his relief.</p>

                        <p>Well, if I could but any way ſee him thoroughly vexed, every groan of his would be muſic to me; yet faith, I believe it impoſſible. I have tried to fret him myſelf every morning theſe three years; but, inſtead of being angry, he ſits as calmly to hear me ſcold, as he does to his hair-dreſſer.</p>

What a pity it is, Jarvis, that any man's good will to others ſhould produce ſo much neglect of himſelf, as to require correction. Yet, we muſt touch his weakneſſes with a delicate

                        <p>Love me! Sure, Jarvis, you dream. No, no; her intimacy with me never amounted to more than friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip—mere friendſhip. That ſhe is the moſt lovely woman that ever warm'd the human heart with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, I own. But never let me harbour a thought of making her unhappy, by a connection with one ſo unworthy her merits as I am. No, Jarvis, it ſhall be my ſtudy to ſerve her, even in ſpite of my wiſhes; and to ſecure her happineſs, tho' it deſtroys my own.</p>

                        <speaker>MISS RICHLAND.</speaker>
                        <p>OLIVIA not his ſiſter? Olivia not Leontine's ſiſter? You amaze me!</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>GARNET.</speaker>
                        <p>No more his ſiſter than I am; I had it all from his own ſervant; I can get any thing from that quarter.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>MISS RICHLAND.</speaker>
                        <p>But how? Tell me again, Garnet.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>GARNET.</speaker>
                        <p>Why, madam, as I told you before, inſtead of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Lyons, to bring home his ſiſter, who has been there with her aunt theſe ten years; he never went further than Paris; there he ſaw and fell in love with this young lady, by the bye, of a prodigious family.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>MISS RICHLAND.</speaker>
                        <p>And brought her home to my guardian, as his daughter?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>GARNET.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, and his daughter ſhe will be. If he don't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to their marriage, they talk of trying what a Scotch parſon can do.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>MISS RICHLAND.</speaker>
                        <p>Well, I own they have deceived me—And ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murely as Olivia carried it too!—Would you believe it, Garnet, I told her all my ſecrets; and yet the ſly cheat concealed all this from me?</p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>GARNET.</speaker>
                        <p>And, upon my word, madam, I don't much blame her; ſhe was loath to truſt one with her ſecrets, that was ſo very bad at keeping her own.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>MISS RICHLAND.</speaker>
                        <p>But, to add to their deceit, the young gentleman, it ſeems, pretends to make me ſerious propoſals. My guardian and he are to be here preſently, to open the affair in form. You know I am to loſe half my fortune if I refuſe him.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>GARNET.</speaker>
                        <p>Yet, what can you do? For being, as you are, in love with Mr. Honeywood, madam—</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>MISS RICHLAND.</speaker>
                        <p>How! idiot; what do you mean? In love with Mr. Honeywood! Is this to provoke me?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>GARNET.</speaker>
                        <p>That is, madam, in friendſhip with him; I meant nothing more than friendſhip, as I hope to be married; nothing more.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>MISS RICHLAND.</speaker>
                        <p>Well, no more of this! As to my guardian, and his ſon, they ſhall find me prepared to receive them; I'm reſolved to accept their propoſal with ſeeming pleaſure, to mortify them by compliance, and ſo throw the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal at laſt upon them.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>GARNET.</speaker>
                        <p>Delicious! and that will ſecure your whole fortune to yourſelf. Well, who could have thought ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent a face could cover ſo much cuteneſs!</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>MISS RICHLAND.</speaker>
                        <p>Why, girl, I only oppoſe my prudence to their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and practiſe a leſſon they have taught me againſt themſelves.</p>

                        <p>Lord! good ſir, moderate your fears; you're ſo plaguy ſhy, that one would think you had changed ſexes. I tell you we muſt have the half or the whole. Come, let me ſee with what ſpirit you begin? Well, why don't you? Eh! What? Well then—I muſt, it ſeems—Miſs Richland, my dear, I believe you gueſs at our buſineſs; an affair which my ſon here comes to open, that nearly concerns your happineſs.</p>

                        <p>Yes, my dear; it comes intirely from my ſon; it's all a requeſt of his own, madam. And I will permit him to make the beſt of it.</p>

                        <p>The whole affair is only this, madam; my father has a propoſal to make, which he inſiſts none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall deliver.</p>

                        <p>'AN Engliſh gentleman, of large fortune, has for ſome time made private, tho' honourable propoſals to your daughter Olivia. They love each other tenderly, and I find ſhe has conſented, without let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any of the family know, to crown his addreſſes. As ſuch good offers don't come every day, your own good ſenſe, his large fortune, and family conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will induce you to forgive her.</p>
                        <p>'Yours ever, RACHEL CROAKER.'</p>
                        <p>My daughter, Olivia, privately contracted to a man of large fortune! This is good news indeed. My heart never foretold me of this. And yet, how ſlily the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle baggage has carried it ſince ſhe came home. Not a word on't to the old ones for the world. Yet, I thought, I ſaw ſomething ſhe wanted to conceal.</p>

                        <p>Ay, favours are more eaſily aſked than granted, as we ſay among us that practice the law. I have taken an oath againſt granting favours. Would you have me perjure myſelf?</p>

                        <p>Yet, Mr. Honeywood, this does not convince me but that ſeverity in criticiſm is neceſſary. It was our firſt adopting the ſeverity of French taſte, that has brought them in turn to taſte us.</p>

They draw a parallel, madam, between the mental taſte and that of our ſenſes. We are injured as much by French ſeverity in the one, as by French rapacity in the other. That's their meaning.</p>

Yet, it gives me plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to find, that, among a number of worthleſs friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, he has made one acquiſition of real value; for there muſt be ſome ſofter paſſion on her ſide that prompts this generoſity.

                        <p>Then, madam, what can we do? You know I never make promiſes. In truth, I once or twice tried to do ſomething with him in the way of buſineſs; but, as I often told his uncle, ſir William Honeywood, the man was utterly impracticable.</p>

I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly contented to huſband out my places and penſions with ſome degree of frugality; but, curſe it, of late I have given away the whole Court Regiſter in leſs time than they could print the title page: yet, hang it, why ſcruple a lie or two to come at a fine girl, when I every day tell a thouſand for nothing. Ha! Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood here before me. Could miſs Richland have ſet him at liberty?</p>

as I had been once her father's friend, I did all in my power to fruſtrate her guardian's baſe intentions. I had even meditated to reſcue her from his authority, when your ſon ſtept in with more pleaſing violence, gave her liberty, and you a daughter.</p>

                        <p>Ay, ſir, too well I ſee it; and I can't but ſay I have had ſome boding of it theſe ten days. So, I'm reſolved, ſince my ſon has placed his affections on a lady of moderate fortune, to be ſatisfied with his choice, and not run the hazard of another Mr. Lofty, in helping him to a better.</p>

I ſaw, with indignation, the errors of a mind that only ſought applauſe from others; that eaſineſs of diſpoſition, which, though inclined to the right, had not courage to condemn the wrong. I ſaw, with regret, thoſe ſplendid errors, that ſtill took name from ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring duty. Your charity, that was but injuſtice; your benevolence, that was but weakneſs; and your friendſhip, but credulity. I ſaw, with regret, great talents and extenſive learning, only employed to add ſprightlineſs to error, and encreaſe your perplexities. I ſaw your mind with a thouſand natural charms: but, the greatneſs of its beauty ſerved only to heighten my pity for its proſtitution.</p>

this very hour, to quit for ever a place where I have made myſelf the voluntary ſlave of all; and to ſeek among ſtrangers that fortitude which may give ſtrength to the mind, and marſhal all its diſſipated virtues. Yet, ere I depart, permit me to ſolicit favour for this gentleman; who, notwithſtanding what has happened, has laid me under the moſt ſignal obligations. Mr. Lofty—</p>

                        <p>Mr. Honeywood, I'm reſolved upon a reformation, as well as you. I now begin to find, that the man who firſt invented the art of ſpeaking truth was a much cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninger fellow than I thought him. And, to prove that I deſign to ſpeak truth for the future, I muſt now aſſure you, that you owe your late enlargement to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; as, upon my ſoul, I had no hand in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So now if any of the company has a mind for preferment, he may take my place, I'm determined to reſign. <stage>[Exit.</stage>

                           <p>I VOW, Mr. Hardcaſtle, you're very particular. Is there a creature in the whole country, but ourſelves, that does not take a trip to town now and then, to rub off the ruſt a little? There's the two miſs Hoggs, and our neighbour, Mrs. Grigſby, go to take a month's poliſhing every winter.</p>

                           <p>Ay, and bring back vanity and affection to laſt them the whole year. I wonder why London cannot keep its own fools at home. In my time, the follies of the town crept ſlowly among us, but now they travel faſter than a ſtage-coach. Its fopperies come down, not only as inſide paſſengers, but in the very baſket.</p>

                           <p>Humour, my dear: nothing but humour. Come, Mr. Hardcaſtle, you muſt allow the boy a little hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>

                           <p>I'd ſooner allow him an horſe-pond. If burning the footmens ſhoes, frighting the maids, and worry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the kittens, be humour, he has it.

                        <p>O! Sir, you're only pleaſed to ſay ſo. We country perſons can have no manner at all. I'm in love with the town, and that ſerves to raiſe me above ſome of our neighbouring ruſtics; but who can have a manner, that has never ſeen the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theon, the Grotto Gardens, the Borough, and ſuch places where the nobility chiefly reſort? All I can do, is to enjoy London at ſecond-hand. I take care to know every tête-à-tête from the ſcandalous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine, and have all the faſhions, as they come out, in a letter from the two miſs Rickets of Crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane. Pray how do you like this head, Mr. Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</p>

                           <p>You ſhall hear. I firſt took them down Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-bed-lane, where we ſtuck faſt in the mud. I then rattled them crack over the ſtones of Up-and<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down Hill—I then introduc'd them to the gibbet on Heavy-tree Heath, and from that, with a circumben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus, I fairly lodged them in the horſe-pond at the bottom of the garden.</p>

                           <p>My dear Conſtance, why will you deliberate thus? If we delay a moment, all is loſt for ever. Pluck up a little reſolution, and we ſhall ſoon be out of the reach of her malignity.</p>

                           <p>I find it impoſſible. My ſpirits are ſo ſunk with the agitations I have ſuffered, that I am unable to face any new danger. Two or three years patience will at laſt crown us with happineſs.</p>

                     <l>As I have conquer'd him to conquer you:</l>

                     <l>Harmleſs and young, of ev'ry thing afraid;</l>
                     <l>Bluſhes when hir'd, and with unmeaning action,</l>

Her ſecond act diſplays a livelier ſcene,—</l>

                     <l>Next the ſcene ſhifts to town, and there ſhe ſoars,</l>
                     <l>The chop-houſe toaſt of ogling connoiſieurs.</l>

                     <l>Even common councilmen forget to eat.</l>
                     <l>The fourth act ſhews her wedded to the 'ſquire,</l>
                     <l>And madam now begins to hold it higher;</l>
                     <l>Pretends to taſte, at Operas cries caro,</l>
                     <l>And quits her Nancy Dawſon, for Che Faro.</l>
                     <l>Doats upon dancing, and in all her pride,</l>
                     <l>Swims round the room, the Heinel of Cheapſide:</l>
                     <l>Ogles and leers with artificial ſkill,</l>
