            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE laſt general meeting of the County of York having adopted a propoſition <q>
                  <hi>to ſhorten the duration of parliament to a term not exceeding three years,</hi>
               </q> the worthy gentlemen of your own committee may probably have been induced, by the laudable deſire of preſerving <hi>unanimity</hi> with that reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble county, to recommend the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition for your adoption. Be pleaſed, therefore, previouſly to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is probable that a majority of the freeholders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Yorkſhire meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing did really mean to prefer <hi>triennial elections</hi> to the ancient legal uſage and conſtitution of <hi>annual parliaments,</hi> or whether they may not rather have been induced to poſtpone the open declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their <hi>loyal</hi> attachment to that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>law</hi> for frequent parliaments, <hi>(viz.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0299501300:3"/>
every year once, and more often if need be,)</hi> merely through a deſire to preſerve the <hi>unanimity</hi> of their <hi>own meeting,</hi> by yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little, for the preſent, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of a few particular gentlemen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, (perſons, indeed, of great worth and eſteem, in many reſpects, and whoſe ſentiments in general deſerve the utmoſt attention and regard, but) who unhappily, in this point, are apt to conceive, that <hi>annual</hi> elections, and <q>
                  <hi>more often if need be,</hi>
               </q> would be attended with ſome inconveniences to <hi>themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have undoubtedly, in your own county, alſo, ſeveral worthy gentlemen of fortune, to whom great reſpect is due from <hi>the people,</hi> on account of their known independence, and ſteady oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to bad meaſures in general, who nevertheleſs, perhaps, may entertain <hi>the ſame erroneous conceptions of frequent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections;</hi> and therefore you can, by your own feelings, (I mean your reſpect and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0299501300:4"/>
eſteem for ſuch worthy men,) more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily judge of <hi>the effect</hi> which the ſame kind of laudable influence muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily have cauſed in the Yorkſhire meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which is the beſt reaſon, I believe, that can be aſſigned for their having adopted that <hi>unconſtitutional</hi> meaſure.</p>
            <p>You are therefore moſt earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to conſider the following plain propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That, though great deference and reſpect be certainly due to ſuch worthy and independent gentlemen as I have deſcribed, yet your condeſcenſion to them ought to have ſome <hi>due limitation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. That the bounds of the <hi>ancient parliamentary conſtitution</hi> of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ought ſurely to mark out <hi>the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent</hi> of your compliance with the worthy part of the <hi>ariſtocratical intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. That if, on the contrary, your endeavours to preſerve UNANIMITY
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0299501300:5"/>
ſhould carry you <hi>beyond theſe legal bounds,</hi> you will really injure thoſe very gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whom you wiſh to oblige, as well as the whole <hi>ariſtocratical intereſt</hi> (the crown, the lords, the country gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in general); becauſe there is but <hi>one true common intereſt,</hi> which <hi>the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental laws of the conſtitution alone can preſerve.</hi> Conſider alſo,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That <hi>unanimity</hi> is as <hi>baneful</hi> in a bad meaſure as it is <hi>ſalutary</hi> in a good one: and,</p>
            <p n="5">V. That, if any <hi>compliance</hi> in proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is to be made at all <q>
                  <hi>for the ſake of unanimity,</hi>
               </q> it ought certainly to be made where a <hi>compliance is moſt due;</hi> viz. to the <hi>conſtitutional reſolutions</hi> of a ſelect body of intelligent gentlemen, <hi>deputed to a national conference,</hi> by freely-elected committees from a very conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the counties and moſt populous cities and towns in England;—to reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were <hi>unanimouſly</hi> agreed upon by the ſaid <hi>deputies;</hi> and, therefore,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0299501300:6"/>
               <hi>"a compliance, for the ſake of unanimity,"</hi> was moſt juſtly due to <hi>them;</hi> and, the more eſpecially, as it appears that they formed their concluſions by the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental laws and uſages of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <note n="‖" place="bottom">The deputies, in their memorial, declare, that <q>
                     <hi>ſhortening the duration of the ſitting of parliament can only be done,</hi> CONSISTENTLY WITH THE CONSTITUTION, <hi>or with the beſt policy in any enlarged view,</hi> BY SHORT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENING IT TO THE PERIOD OF A YEAR.</q> And this they farther explain in the words of the old ſtatutes, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>that a parliament ſhould be holden</hi> ONCE <hi>every year, and</hi> MORE OFTEN <hi>if need be;</hi>
                  </q> from whence it is manifeſt, that <hi>the longeſt duration, conſiſtent with the conſtitution, is the period of one ſingle ſeſſion,</hi> even though two or more ſuch ſeſſions ſhould be neceſſary in <hi>one</hi> or <hi>the ſame</hi> year.</note> The ſtriking, ſimilarity alſo of <hi>this deputation,</hi> in many reſpects, to an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent example of a <hi>national deputation</hi> from all the counties, cited, on this occaſion, by lord Carysfort,<note n="*" place="bottom">See page 15 of his lordſhip's very judicious and <hi>loyal</hi> letter to the committee of the county of Huntingdon.</note> from Hoveden, adds great weight to the reſolutions in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as to the importance of that <hi>unanimity</hi> with which they were formed.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That the members of the late depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation have <hi>unanimouſly</hi> declared, in their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0299501300:7"/>
memorial, that <q>
                  <hi>annual parliaments</hi> are the <hi>ancient conſtitution</hi> of this kingdom, and the <hi>birthright of Engliſhmen;</hi>
               </q> and, in the three laſt paragraphs of their <hi>memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> which are highly worthy your moſt careful attention, have not only proved that the old <hi>laws,</hi> requiring <q>a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to be holden every year once, and more often if need be,</q> meant a <hi>new</hi> parliament <hi>every year, &amp;c.</hi> (by the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of writs iſſued <q>two or three times in the ſame year, for new elections,</q>) but they alſo prove, from the experience of former ages, that theſe <hi>very frequent elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> were <hi>not</hi> attended with any ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, as the advocates for long parliaments commonly pretend, but, on the contrary, recommend them, <hi>"as conſiſtent with the greateſt peace," &amp;c.</hi>—<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>
                     <q>The fact is, (ſay the deputies from the ſeveral peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning counties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) during the whole of that reign, (king Edw. III.) and for the firſt eighteen years of the following one, writs were annually iſſued, and, in ſome inſtances, two or three times in the ſame year, for new elections, till Richard II. made himſelf abſolute. And various were the occaſions, in thoſe times, when the commons gave for anſwer, to any new propoſitions of magnitude, that THEY DARED NOT AGREE WITH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUT CONFERENCE WITH THEIR COUNTRIES. At what period then was it, that the conſent of the people was aſked and obtained to ſo momentous a propoſal as that of diveſting them of their expected controul over their repreſentatives? in fact, of changing the terms on which the delegation had paſſed from their hands? AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUAL PARLIAMENTS are, therefore, the ANCIENT CONSTITUTION of England, and the BIRTHRIGHT of Engliſhmen.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Nor are they leſs beneficial in policy than unalienable in right. In the language of ancient times, before the prejudices of habit had thrown falſe colours over names and things, <hi>they were ever deſcribed as conſiſtent with the greateſt peace, and moſt peaceably conducted.</hi> And, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary records, for more than two hundred years together, from 49 Hen. III. till 22 Edw. IV. we find not ſo much as <hi>one</hi> double return, nor more than two or three inſtances of elections queſtioned on any ground;— a circumſtance ſurely moſt inviting, when put in contraſt with that multitude of perplexing enquiries which, of late years, hath conſumed ſo much time in committees, to the great hindrance of the national buſineſs. The plain reaſon is founded not in the time, but in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of the thing; the duration of the ſeat was not an object for a violent conteſt. This will alſo diſpel the objection ariſing from the probability of tumult and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſiveneſs; to remove which it will farther contribute not a little, if we would give attention to what paſſes now among thoſe large bodies of electors, who annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chooſe their corporate officers. But the argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt corruption ſurmounts every thing elſe. Nothing can give ſo much aſſurance of defeating it as this limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A ſeat for three years might induce a man's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to a bribe. He that ſits but for one is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to experience ſuch an offer, or will certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it, if he would not wiſh to put all his future expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to an imminent riſque.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>When once the conſtitution of parliament is improved in theſe leading points, every thing elſe, that may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have its ſhare in reformation, muſt be ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in its claſs, and muſt follow in its time. And, the more effectually to inſure theſe, we entreat you, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the next or any future election, to engage your ſupport to any candidate, before you are ſatisfied that he will give his aſſiſtance, in parliament, to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of ſo much of theſe reforms as may not then be accompliſhed.</q>
                  </p>
               </note>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0299501300:8"/>
And, therefore, you are deſired to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0299501300:9"/>VII. That the Yorkſhire propoſition for ſhortening <q>the duration of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to a term, not exceeding three years,</q> is totally different from the <hi>ſhortening of duration,</hi> explained and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the ſaid deputies, as <q>the ancient conſtitution of the kingdom, and the birthright of Engliſhmen;</q> and, what is worſe, has been adopted without the leaſt mention of that <hi>birthright</hi> in any ſaving clauſe, to aſſert and preſerve your juſt claim to it for a <hi>future</hi> time: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is manifeſt, that the promoters of this <hi>triennial</hi> ſcheme have really been <hi>the firſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0299501300:10"/>
offenders</hi> againſt that deſirable <hi>unanimity,</hi> which the conference of deputies was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to effect; and, therefore, the cry of <hi>"neceſſary unanimity,"</hi> by which alone that <hi>unconſtitutional</hi> propoſition is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent recommended, deſerves not the leaſt attention. What! would you be <hi>unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> againſt the ancient legal parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary conſtitution of the kingdom, which the <hi>triennial</hi> ſcheme is manifeſtly calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to ſupplant? You ought never to forget,</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. That the people have already been betrayed by a <hi>triennial</hi> parliament! That the <hi>repreſentatives</hi> of the people, in a <hi>triennial</hi> parliament, uſurped the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative authority of their conſtituents for a longer time than it was delegated; and treacherouſly preſumed, <q>without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting their countries,</q> to prolong the duration of parliaments to the preſent unreaſonable term of <hi>ſeven</hi> years; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0299501300:11"/>
by they eſtabliſhed the baſis of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable ſyſtem of corruption which has been the true ſource of all your preſent grievances! And, therefore, be pleaſed to conſider, —</p>
            <p n="9">IX. That <hi>triennial</hi> parliaments, as well as <hi>ſeptennial,</hi> are manifeſtly dangerous to the ſtate, and ſo groſſly inconſiſtent with the ancient legal parliamentary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this kingdom, that the moſt eſſential <hi>laws</hi> and <hi>uſages,</hi> by which that conſtitution is declared and known, are really <hi>ſuſpended</hi> by them. You cannot, therefore, without notorious <hi>diſloyalty,</hi> (in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word,) adopt the propoſition for <hi>triennial</hi> parliaments: ſo that you have a moſt ample excuſe for not concurring with a few particular gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, (whom you would otherwiſe wiſh to oblige,) <hi>viz.</hi> that your <hi>compliance</hi> with them, in this matter would exceed the <hi>conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal</hi> bounds of condeſcenſion, (mentioned
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0299501300:12"/>
in the three firſt propoſitions,) and would really tend to ſubvert the people's juſt right <hi>to more frequent elections.</hi> — Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is manifeſt, —</p>
            <p n="10">X. That the <hi>conceſſion</hi> of a popular right, made by the people themſelves in their collective capacity, at their ſeveral county-meetings, is infinitely more bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them (to exclude any future claim to the ceded right) than the ſame <hi>conceſſion</hi> would be, if made merely by their <hi>repreſentatives</hi> in parliament, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the inſtruction or concurrence of the people. And, therefore, you ought to be particularly thankful, —</p>
            <p n="11">XI. That the people themſelves, the great body of conſtituents, have never yet, by any ſuch <hi>conceſſion,</hi> betrayed that valuable <hi>birthright,</hi> (as the deputies call it,) the ancient <hi>law</hi> for <hi>annual</hi> parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It has too often been <hi>ſuſpended</hi> indeed; ſometimes through the <hi>diſloyalty</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0299501300:13"/>
of kings, and laſtly even by the <hi>diſloyalty</hi> of parliament itſelf, (of which the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical <hi>triennial</hi> and <hi>ſeptennial</hi> acts are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable inſtances); yet, as the <hi>ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of it has never been promoted by the requiſition or inſtruction of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at large, their right to it remains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. The preſumption and treachery of their repreſentatives, in conſenting to the <hi>triennial</hi> and <hi>ſeptennial</hi> acts, cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure their juſt title to it; becauſe, in both theſe inſtances, the repreſentatives pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to act contrary to an eſtabliſhed rule of parliament, by adopting a <hi>new device,</hi> (which even affected a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal law of the kingdom,) <q>without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting their countries,</q> which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution abſolutely requires in ſuch an important caſe; ſo that even that unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable preſumption of the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives (in neglecting to conſult the people) is the very circumſtance which ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0299501300:14"/>
that fundamental and eſſential law <hi>as a part of the conſtitution,</hi> and as a juſt right of the people, which they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to demand and reſume whenever they ſhall be pleaſed to inſtruct their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives for that purpoſe; and to charge all perſons with <hi>diſloyalty,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>treaſon to the conſtitution,</hi> who ſhall dare to oppoſe them! But if, on the contrary, the <hi>people themſelves, in their ſeveral county-courts,</hi> or <hi>aſſemblies,</hi> ſhould be ſo inconſiderate, or ſo depraved, as to conſent indiſcriminately to the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a <hi>triennial</hi> election, without a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving clauſe to aſſert their <hi>birthright</hi> and reſerve their title to more frequent elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (which the Yorkſhire meeting has unwarily done,) know, for a certainty,—</p>
            <p n="12">XII. That, in ſuch an unhappy inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to their own rights, (which, I pray to God, they may never be curſed with,) they would <hi>betray</hi> the conſtitution
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0299501300:15"/>
of the kingdom! — they would betray a fundamental <hi>law</hi> of their anceſtors; which would mark their character with an eternal ſtain of <hi>diſloyalty!</hi> And as they may, perhaps, never have again ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable an opportunity, as the preſent, of recovering their ancient birthright of <hi>annual elections,</hi> it would probably be loſt, irretrievably loſt, for ever! Your new triennial repreſentatives (in ſuch a caſe) would moſt likely behave as former triennial repreſentatives have heretofore done, — <hi>betray and enſlave you by another ſeptennial ſyſtem of corruption!</hi> And (what is worſe) you yourſelves would <hi>moſt juſtly deſerve it!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I hope better things of you; and I truſt alſo that you will excuſe the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my expreſſions in this addreſs, as being prompted merely by an ardent zeal for your proſperity.</p>
