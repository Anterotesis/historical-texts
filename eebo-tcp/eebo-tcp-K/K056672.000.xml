            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

ESSAY
ON THE
Treaty of Commerce
WITH
FRANCE, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is in vain to make Complaints of
the Iniquity of the Times; and
make a long Introduction to blame
the People for the Humour that at
preſent, like a Contagion, infects the
Nation, and ſpreads it ſelf Univerſally
into all Converſation, (<hi>viz.</hi>) of finding
Fault with, and Condemning every pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Tranſaction, before they Weigh or
Conſider the Reaſon and Nature of the
thing. It is enough to ſit down and
look on it with regret, and with a juſt
Pity for the Diſtempers of our Native
Country, apply ſuitable Remedies for
the uſe of ſuch as are not Incurable, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0386703500:3"/>
for the opening the Eyes of thoſe who
are not wilfully and reſolutely blind;
leaving the reſt, as the Pariſhes uſed to
do Houſes ſhut up with the Plague, to
their own Fate, with <hi>Lord ha' Mercy and
a Croſs</hi> ſet upon the Door.</p>
            <p>The Treaty of Commerce made with
<hi>France,</hi> is the preſent Subject of every
Man's Diſcourſe, and it were to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
People came to the Reading it with
leſs reſolution to Diſlike it beforehand
than they do, or at leaſt with a juſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to Read and Conſider it, before
they paſſed their judgment for or againſt;
but ſince that cannot be hoped for in this
Age, it may not be a uſeleſs endeavour
to open the Eyes of ſome miſguided miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
People, about ſuch things in the
ſaid Treaty, which they may either on
one ſide or other Cauſeleſly Condemn,
or too eaſily approve. That things being
ſet in a true light, every Man may Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
with himſelf calmly of this matter;
for certainly a thing of this Conſequence
ought to be Duly weigh'd, and Cooly
Debated, before we come to make ſuch
Concluſions as are to Determine our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
both of the Treaty made, and of
thoſe that made it.</p>
            <p>To Do this as it ought to be done, it
ſeems needful to enquire a little into the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0386703500:4"/>
ſtate of our Commerce with <hi>France</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the War began, that People may a
little know upon what Foundation things
formerly ſtood, and may accordingly
judge whether we are better or worſe
than we were before.</p>
            <p>We are told in the Treaty of a General
TARIF, that is, an Act of Trade
made in the Year 1664, by the <hi>French</hi>;
by this, ſome People underſtand a Treaty
of Commerce formerly made between
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> which is a general
miſtake, and which miſtake ought to be
ſet right, the Words themſelves explain
it, <hi>a Tarif made in</hi> France, (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the
Treaty) by which is to be underſtood,
a Table or Decree of the ſeveral Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
and Prohibitions, made by the
King of <hi>France,</hi> for the Regulation
of his own Subjects, declaring what
Goods ſhall be Imported into <hi>France,</hi> and
from what Countries, and what ſhall
not be Imported, and what Cuſtoms
or Duties ſhall be paid in <hi>France</hi> upon
thoſe Goods which are allow'd to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported;
ſomething like our act of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,
allowing for the difference of
the Subject only.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0386703500:5"/>
to their Liberty of Trading into <hi>France,</hi>
upon that Tarif of 1664, <hi>that is to ſay,</hi>
They have declared themſelves Content
with thoſe Conditions of Trade, and have
only Articled that they ſhould not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
obſtructed; and therefore we
found that in all the Tranſactions at
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> when the <hi>Dutch</hi> were Inſiſting
on the particulars of their Trade to <hi>France,</hi>
it was call'd, <hi>The</hi> French <hi>granting</hi> them
the Tarif of 1664, that is, <hi>granting</hi>
that no other Impoſitions or Prohibitions
ſhould be laid upon them in <hi>France,</hi> than
that Act of Trade had formerly laid.</p>
            <p>Purſuant to this Notion, we never find
any of our former Treaties with <hi>France</hi>
make the leaſt mention of theſe things,
ſince admitting or not admitting the
Importation of Goods and Merchandizes
into a Kingdom, is the undoubted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
and Right of the Sovereign Power
or Government of that Kingdom, much
more the determining what Duties, Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or Impoſitions, ſhall be charged
upon the reſpective Goods brought in;
which Payments and Duties being paid
by the People of the ſaid Nation who
Import, no other Nation can Object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them.</p>
            <p>And therefore we find in all our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Treaties, nothing of this nature has
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0386703500:6"/>
been entred into at all: The firſt Treaty
of Peace between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>
after the Reſtoration, was the Treaty of
<hi>Breda, Anno</hi> 1667. wherein all that is
ſaid of this matter, is in the Fourth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
thus, <q rend="inline">"Navigation and Commerce
ſhall be Free between the Subjects of
both the Kings, as it was during the
Peace, inſomuch that all of them may

Kingdoms, Provinces, Places of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,

            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Feburary</hi> following, there was a
Treaty between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
at St. <hi>Germans on Lay,</hi> the late
Duke of <hi>Montague,</hi> being then the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Ambaſſador in <hi>France,</hi> and this is call'd
a Treaty of Commerce; yet from one
end to the other, there is not one Word
mention'd in it of the Duties paid or to
be paid in either Kingdom by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants;
as what really was the peculiar
of every Prince or Sovereign Power
in their reſpective Dominions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tho' this Treaty is called a Treaty of
Commerce, it ought rather to have been
call'd a Treaty of Navigation, every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
therein reſpecting the Navigation of
Ships, Freedom of Ports, Viſiting Ships,

and how to be Seiz'd, and the like; but
not a Word about Tolls, Cuſtoms, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon Importation.</p>
            <p>The next Treaty, was that of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi>
where the <hi>Dutch</hi> were only immediately
concern'd, and a Treaty of Commerce
was likewiſe ſettled then, between <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Holland, Anno</hi> 1678, but even in
this Treaty we have not a Word relating
to what Duties or Impoſits the <hi>French</hi>
ſhould lay upon Goods Imported into
<hi>France,</hi> except as follows. <q rend="inline">"Neither
Party ſhall be permitted to grant to
their own Subjects any Immunities,
Benefits, Gratuitous Conceſſions, or
any other Advantages, beſides thoſe

The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were as much concern'd
in this Impoſition of Fifty <hi>Sols per</hi> Tun, as
any Nation, the <hi>Dutch</hi> excepted; but
ſeeing no juſt Foundation to object againſt
the reaſonableneſs of the <hi>French</hi> laying
ſuch an Impoſition, and having by their
own Act, called, <hi>The Act of Navigation,</hi>
done almoſt the ſame thing, or in effect
worſe, they contented themſelves with
laying a like Duty of 5 <hi>s. per</hi> Tun, upon
all <hi>French</hi> Ships which ſhould Lade in the

reſted till this time.</p>
            <p>The next Treaty of Peace was at <hi>Ryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
and in this <hi>England</hi> made no Treaty
of Commerce at all; It was indeed Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally
agreed, that Commiſſioners ſhould
be appointed to meet afterwards to enter
into a Treaty of Commerce, and to ſettle
the Trade between the two Nations;
But as <hi>France</hi> did not ſeek it, and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
thought they had no occaſion for it,
the War alſo being very quickly renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that Propoſal vaniſhed.</p>
            <p>Now to make way a little to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
the preſent Article of Commerce
in debate, it may not be amiſs to enquire
Why <hi>England</hi> was ſo indifferent at the late
Treaty at <hi>Ryſwick,</hi> whether they entred
into a Treaty of Commerce with <hi>France</hi>
or no? And if this thing be rightly Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0386703500:11"/>
it will open the Eyes of many, if
not of every conſidering Perſon, to the
Juſtice, nay, to the Advantage to <hi>England,</hi>
by the preſent Article of the Treaty of
Commerce now made, which ſo many
complain of, and ſo few underſtand.</p>
            <p>It is too well known, to need any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
that <hi>England</hi> had for many Years,
we may ſay Ages, carried on the Trade
with <hi>France,</hi> with manifeſt diſadvantages;
That by the prodigious quantity of Wines,
Brandies, Silks, Linnen, Paper, Glaſs,
and other Goods, which we greedlly
Imported into <hi>England</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> the
Ballance of Trade went againſt us to a
very great yearly Sum; <hi>France</hi> having
uſed many ways to encourage the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
of their own People in Woollen
Manufactures there, in order to leſſen, as
much as might be, the demand they
might make from <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the War interven'd, <hi>England</hi>

high Duties upon ſome of the
Goods uſually Imported from <hi>France,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
Wine and Brandy, and others
were entirely prohibited to encourage

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0386703500:12"/>
Wrought Silks, and the like, theſe high
Duties and Prohibitions remain'd in Force
even when the War was at end; nor did
the reſtoring of Commerce in general
Terms by the Treaty of <hi>Ryſwick</hi> alter the
Caſe at all.</p>
            <p>It came immediately into Debate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Men of Trade, Whether the
<hi>French</hi> Trade was worth ſo much to us
as to make it worth while to open it at
the Expence of taking off thoſe high
Duties and Prohibitions or no? And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
ſo evident that it was abſolutely
neceſſary to keep on the high Duties, as
well to encourage the Trade to <hi>Portugal,</hi>
from whence all our Wines came in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
for Woollen Manufactures; as alſo to
prevent the exceſſive Flux of <hi>French</hi> Wine
and Brandy to the over-ballancing the
Trade to <hi>France,</hi> as alſo to ſupport our
ſeveral Manufactures of Silk, Glaſs, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
Wrought Linnen, Iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in
which we began to Improve, ſo as to be
likely in time, not to want any or thoſe
Goods from <hi>France.</hi> I ſay this appeared
ſo evident, that no Man c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uld think with
any Patience, of entring into any Treaty
of Commerce with <hi>France</hi>; but every one
was convinc'd, that it was neceſſary to
keep on the high Duties, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to give the
Advantage to the other Trades above
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0386703500:13"/>
named, and keep the <hi>French</hi> Trade under
foot.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe accounts it was that no
Treaty ever came to any head with <hi>France</hi>
(notwithſtanding Peace was made) for
the regulation of Commerce, and it was
apparent that <hi>England</hi> was in the right of
it at that time, for that in that Interval of
time, from the Peace of <hi>Reſwick,</hi> to the
Commencement of the laſt War, the
<hi>French</hi> bought exceeding Great Quantities
of Goods from us, while we on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
took but very few Goods of them
in Return, and the Ballance of Trade was
turn'd againſt <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This the <hi>French</hi> King was ſo ſenſible of,
That to give his People the Equivalent,
he made a new Tarif or Settlement of
Duties and Cuſtoms of Goods <hi>Anno</hi> 1699.
the ſame which is now mentioned in the
9th Article of the preſent Treaty, by
which ſome Goods he entirely Prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from <hi>England,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi>) Red Herrings,
which when ſome of his own Merchants
Petitioned againſt, he anſwered wiſely,
<hi>Is not the Sea open? If my Subjects want
Herrings let them Catch them, not Buy
them of others.</hi> Upon other Goods from
<hi>England</hi> he laid higher Duties than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
eſpecially our Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
ſuppoſing two things, (1.) That
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0386703500:14"/>
it would encourage his own People
to make them at Home; and (2.)
might lead the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to open the Trade
for <hi>French</hi> Wines and Brandies, in order
to make way for the Trade of the Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Manufactures again into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this had no effect here; for the
Government here, who eaſily foreſaw that
the Trade of our Woollen Manufactures
in <hi>France,</hi> was never equal to their Trade
of Wine and Brandy here, and that
the Channel of Trade was Happily
turn'd to our Advantage againſt <hi>France,</hi>
were far from enclining to alter it, and
thus the Notion of a Treaty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
was ſlighted as a thing <hi>France</hi>
might deſire indeed, but we were better
without than with; And this was the
true Reaſon why it never came to a head.</p>
            <p>Upon renewing the War, New Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions
of Commerce on both ſides fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
of Courſe, and to prevent the Wine
Trade falling in by private Methods, ſuch
as Confiſcation, Prize-taking and the like,
under which Heads, while the Duties were
low, great quantities of <hi>French</hi> Wine was
dayly brought, a new Duty additional
to the former was lay'd upon Wine and
Brandy, particularly 25 <hi>per</hi> Ton upon
the Wine, and <hi>per</hi> Ton upon the
Brandy, which amounted to a meer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0386703500:15"/>
except for a very ſmall quantity,
ſo great an Advance of the Price reducing
the Conſumption to almoſt nothing; and
the <hi>Portugal</hi> Wines, a very profitable
Trade to <hi>England,</hi> became our general
Draught all over <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the true ſtate of the Affair of
Commerce between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>
and thus Her Majeſty found things when
her Miniſters came at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> to Treat of
the Settling a New Treaty of Commerce,
and from Hence it will appear that the
Meaſures taken in the ſaid Treaty, and
the Conditions agreed on relating to our
Manufactures in <hi>France,</hi> and their Wine
and Brandy in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and taking
off the Duty on either ſide, are not only
equal and juſt, but are founded on the
True Intereſt of Trade, and much more
to the advantage of <hi>Britain</hi> than of <hi>France,</hi>
as will appear, if the following Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
are Impartially Conſidered.</p>
            <p>Upon this New Treaty, after having
in General Agreed in the 6th Article, thus,
That <hi>the Subjects of each Party ſhall Pay the
Tolls, Cuſtoms and Duties of Import and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
through all the Dminions and Provinces
of either Party, as are Due and Accuſtomed:</hi>
That is, as the Government of that reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Country ſhall Exact or legally Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
And again in the 5th Article, <q rend="inline">'That
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0386703500:16"/>
Subjects of each of their Royal Majeſties
may have Leave and Licence, to come
with their Ships, as alſo with the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes

(the Trade and Importation where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>This again allows that either Nation
may Make, and Continue ſuch Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Trade as they think fit, without
any Infringement of the Peace. Indeed
the Nature of the Thing implies that
they ſhould and ought to do ſo; for every
Country is judge for themſelves, what it
is they ought to Admit, and what to
Prohibit.</p>
            <p>The Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> then finding
the High Duties neceſſary to be Continued
upon Wine and Brandy, at leaſt to a certain
Degree, as well to ſupport the Appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of thoſe Duties, as to prevent the
Ruin of our Trade; and alſo Conſidering
that thoſe Duties being laid by Parliament,
could not be taken off but by Parliament;
and that therefore the Plenipotentiaries
could not poſitively agree to take off
what their Principals had no Diſpenſing
Power to Direct. Our ſaid Miniſters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0386703500:17"/>
               <hi>I ſay,</hi> could not therefore reaſonably
yield to the taking off thoſe Duties by an
abſolute Conceſſion: And as it could not be
expected on the other hand that the <hi>French</hi>
would, without ſuch a Conceſſion, take
off the Duties they had laid on our Goods,
and leave the Duties we had laid upon
theirs to be paid, there appeared but one
Expedient for ſettling this, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the 9th Article (<hi>viz.</hi>) That
when the Parliament and Government of
<hi>England</hi> ſhall agree to take off the high
Duties in <hi>England,</hi> then the <hi>French</hi> ſhall
take off their Duties upon our Goods in
<hi>France:</hi> The Ballance of Equallity in
which is evedently given to <hi>Great Britain,</hi>
in that the <hi>French</hi> are bound, and the
Choice is given to <hi>England,</hi> whether to
take off their Duties and open the Trade,
or let it remain as it is.</p>
            <p>I can ſee no Objection that lies againſt
this Article, but what is founded upon
thoſe unreaſonable Peoples Notions, who
expect the <hi>French</hi> to give up all Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Trade to us, and that we at the
ſame time ſhould abſolutely tye up our
Trade from them; and ſince the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Trade as it now ſtands lyes
manifeſtly againſt the <hi>French,</hi> the leaving
this Article to our own Choice, to Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0386703500:18"/>
upon and Determine as we ſhall
find Cauſe, is a tacit preſerving in our
own Hands thoſe Advantages as long as
we ſhall think fit, which is a kind of
Advance made upon the <hi>French,</hi> that they
have very ſeldome been found to admit;
and had any ſuch Advantage been given
on our ſide, ſome People would have val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
themſelves very much upon taking
hold of it, againſt the Prudence or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of thoſe who Managed the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>I ſhall return to this Head again, after
a brief Examination of ſome Clauſes in
Commerce which are ſettled by this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
particularly to the advantage of the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Trade, and which no Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Terms ſhould be Anſwer'd and Silenc'd by
ſuch Particulars; but it may be needful
to remind ſome People (more Reaſonable
than others,) how far the Intereſts of the
Commerce of <hi>Britain</hi> are really ſecured
by this Treaty, and what Advantages in
Trade are obtain'd by this Treaty, which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0386703500:19"/>
never were obtain'd before. <hi>For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Impoſition of 50 <hi>Sols per</hi> Ton
is here expreſly agreed to be quitted in
<hi>France</hi> to all Her Majeſty's Ships: It is
true, we quit at the ſame time the 5 <hi>s.
per</hi> Ton on <hi>French</hi> Ships; but whoever
pleaſes to Calculate the Number of Ships
Trading from each Kingdom reſpectively,
will allow there is no Compariſon to be
made; and tho' we contented our ſelves,
as is noted before, with laying that Duty
of 5 <hi>s. per</hi> Ton upon <hi>French</hi> Shipping, as
a Return for their Tax of 50 <hi>Sols per</hi> Ton,
it was becauſe it was a Duty of the
ſame kind with the other, rather than
that it was any way Proportion'd in the
Collection; and therefore when the
<hi>French</hi> take of their 50 <hi>Sols per</hi> Ton, for
your 5 <hi>s. per</hi> Ton, they give you 20 <hi>s.</hi> for
every 1 <hi>s.</hi> you give them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Liberty of Importing Cured or
Salted Fiſh into <hi>France,</hi> is a Point in
Trade Gain'd m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rly by this Treaty, and
which as I noted before, after the Peace
at <hi>Reſwick,</hi> was abſolutely Prohibited in
<hi>France,</hi> and upon the beſt Reaſons (turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Tables, and making <hi>their</hi> ſide
<hi>our own</hi>) that could be imagined (<hi>viz.</hi>)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0386703500:20"/>
to Encourage his own Subjects to Fiſh for
themſelves, which is many ways an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the <hi>French</hi> more than to other
Nations, eſpecially in the Breeding and
Encreaſing their Seamen, a thing they ſo
greatly want. This Trade by the 3d
Article of the Appendix to the Treaty is
to be admitted, being only referr'd to the
Diſcuſſion of Commiſſioners, whether it
ſhall pay according to the Rule of the
Tarif of 1694, or of 1699.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Liberty of Religion comes in as an
Addition to this Treaty, and which I do
not obſerve to be mentioned in any of the
former Treaties, occaſion'd, I ſuppoſe,
by an Edict of the King of <hi>France,</hi> paſt and

            <p>I might enlarge on the juſtice of this
Article, and the Conſequences, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
it might have brought to this
Nation; but being principally engaged
here, in matters relating to Commerce,
I purpoſely omit it for the preſent.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Fourth Article, <hi>viz.</hi> for the
Freedom and Equality of Importing
<hi>Virginia</hi> Tobacco into <hi>France,</hi> ſeems to
be very conſiderable, and eſpecially upon
two Accounts, or in two Caſes, in which
<hi>England</hi> has been, and might be, under
eſpecial diſadvantages in the Tobacco
Trade in <hi>France</hi>; which Trade, as it is
Improving in <hi>France,</hi> is of the laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
to <hi>England</hi> to preſerve, and if
poſſible, to Improve it; that Trade being
at this time in the greateſt danger ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
of being utterly loſt to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as to that part of it eſpecially which
is Exported again to other Countries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0386703500:22"/>
The two Heads of this Article, relate
(1.) to the ſelling it into <hi>France,</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
which, more eſpecially it is to be
obſerv'd that there is a certain ſet of Men
who have engroſſed, <hi>as we would call it
here,</hi> the Privilege, or obtain'd a Patent
from the King, <hi>to uſe our own Words again,</hi>
for the ſole Liberty of Importing Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co.
Again by another Edict, no Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
can be allowed to Sell or Import any
Tobacco, but it muſt be done by ſuch
and ſuch; ſo that whoever brings any
Tobacco into <hi>France,</hi> is obliged to ſell
it to theſe Men, or have it ſeized, and
give it to them for nothing which he
pleaſes. Now this Monopoly is put to
an end, and the Subjects of the Queen of
<hi>Great Britain,</hi> may Import and Sell their
own Tobacco to whom they pleaſe, and
for the beſt price they can; and in one of
the Articles not yet adjuſted, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by our Ambaſſadors, That the
letting out the Duties of Tobacco to
Farmers, ſhall wholly ceaſe. (2.) The
other Article relating to the Trade of
Tobacco, is, that <hi>Tobacco Imported into</hi>
France <hi>from</hi> England<hi>, ſhall pay the ſame
Duties, and no other, as the Tobacco
of any Country in</hi> Europe <hi>or</hi> America<hi>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought into</hi> France<hi>, does, or ſhall pay</hi>;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0386703500:23"/>
this I mention, becauſe of the loud Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
that ſome People make of the
great probability, nay, certainty, that
after the Peace, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> would
give and take reciprocally ſuch Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
in Trade, to, and from each other,
as ſhould be very much to the detriment
of <hi>England,</hi> and to the Advantage of
<hi>France</hi> in matters of Commerce. Now as
it is manifeſt, that in the Article of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
eſpecially Tobacco prepared, as for
Snuff, <hi>&amp;c. Spain</hi> has great quantities
brought Home yearly from <hi>America,</hi> and
that it would be much for the Advantage
of <hi>Spain</hi> to have the ſame Imported upon
eaſy and good terms into <hi>France</hi>; yet, that
by this Treaty, <hi>France</hi> obliges her ſelf to
give neither <hi>Spain</hi> or any other Nation
any advantage over the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the
Trade of Tobacco.</p>
            <p>Nor is this an Inconſiderable Article,
<hi>France</hi> being lately come into the Cuſtom
of Smoaking Tobacco, and which <hi>England</hi>
can ſupply, (placing the Goodneſs againſt
the Price,) Cheaper and Better than any
Nation in the World, alſo the Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon the <hi>Virginia</hi> Trade which have
happen'd in theſe few years, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidred
together with the diſcouragements
which the <hi>Virginia</hi> Merchants have of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0386703500:24"/>
late met with, this <hi>Article</hi> is of very great
Conſequence to them, and may help
to ſave that ſinking Trade from final Ruin,
till ſome other Methods may be found out
which may reſtore and revive it ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way.</p>
            <p>As to the reſt of the Articles of this
Treaty as they are the ſame <hi>Mutalis Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandis,</hi>
with the other Treaties of the
ſame kind, either made by <hi>England</hi> or by
other Nations with the <hi>French,</hi> there
needs no other Remark to be made, nor
can any Objection lye againſt them, the
uſual Forms being Calculated for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Commerce and Navigation. I
ſhall therefore return to the ſaid Ninth
Article, in which all that can reaſonably
be objected againſt in the whole Treaty
ſeems to be contain'd; and here it may be
enquir'd what the real Objections, that
our People pretend to make are, and to
what they tend; for, till this is known, it
will be very difficult to know what part
of it wants explanation.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing which I meet with, is,
That our high Duties and Impoſitions as
well as Prohibitions, upon the Growth
and Manufactures of <hi>France,</hi> are demanded
to be taken off, and thoſe Duties reduc'd
to an equality with the Duties on the like
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0386703500:25"/>
Goods brought into <hi>Great Britain</hi> from
other Parts.</p>
            <p>This, it is alledged, cannot be done,
(1.) Becauſe it is expreſly ſtipulated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
in our Treaty with <hi>Portugal.</hi>
(2.) Becauſe it would Ruin our Wine
Trade to other Countries. (3.) Becauſe
it would over-run our whole Trade, and
turn the ballance againſt us again, as it was
before in favour of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſhort Anſwer to this without any
Circumlocutions, is, <hi>Then, can't you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
it and not take thoſe Duties off?</hi> But
then ſay Objectors, You cannot have the
free Export of your Manufactures into
<hi>France</hi>; to which the Anſwer is alſo
direct, you muſt do without that too. And
what then? <hi>Why then,</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. You will have as free an Export as
you had before the War.</item>
                  <item>2. You had better be without that
free Export, if the equivalent which
you are to give for it would Ruin your
Trade. But let us enquire into the thing:</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay, <hi>You will have as free an Export
as what you had before the War</hi>; this has
ſome things in it which would a little
reflect upon the Prudence and Judgment
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0386703500:26"/>
of ſome People, and for that Reaſon I
ſhall mention them very cautiouſly;
(1.) You will have the ſame Liberty of
Trade, which you had after the Treaty
of <hi>Ryſwick,</hi> and which then was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
of at all. (2.) If as ſome alledge,
the <hi>French</hi> are ſo fallen upon making the
Woollen Manufactures of <hi>England,</hi> that
they are in a Condition to ſupply <hi>Spain,</hi>
What need have we to inſiſt ſo much, and
at ſo great a Price, upon the Liberty of
ſending our Manufactures to them who
can have no occaſion for them, being
able to ſupply themſelves and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
alſo? But to purſue this Argument
would ſeem Inviduous, this Paper has no
ſuch Deſign, the preſent Argument ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
thus far only; The State of the
Caſe between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>French</hi>
Trade is ſuch, That no other Concluſion
could poſſibly be made, in the particular
Article of the reſpective Duties. Our
Miniſters, if they had been willing,
could not have conceded the high Duties
(laid here) to the <hi>French,</hi> becauſe they
could not repeal Acts of Parliament. Some
of the Prohibitions laid on <hi>French</hi> Goods
are ſo eſſential to the encouraging the like
Manufactures here, that it could by no
means be thought of; at leaſt, till it was
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0386703500:27"/>
laid before the Parliament, by whom
theſe Encouragements and Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
were Granted and Made. On
the other Hand, How could it be asked
of any Nation to open their Doors to our
Trade, and agree that we ſhould ſhut our
Doors againſt theirs? And yet, even in
that Caſe, the Treaty, as it ſtands, has, <hi>as is
ſaid above,</hi> actually done ſo in ſome Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
for whereas not the leaſt Farthing is
abated by the Treaty on our ſide, the <hi>French</hi>
in the ſeveral Articles mentioned before,
have actually receeded from ſeveral things
on their ſide, as the Fifty <hi>Sols per</hi> Ton
upon Ships; the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nopoly of Tobacco;
the admitting Fiſh in Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rels, that is, <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
and <hi>Salmon,</hi> which they had prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
before? All this is done on their
Side without the leaſt Conceſſion on our
Side; but all that is offered on our Side,
is left to the Parliament to determine,
whether they will come into it or no.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Equivalent, which you are
to grant in Lieu of the <hi>French</hi> Trade be
too great, if it be ruinous to our Trade,
we had better be without it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0386703500:28"/>
Upon this Foundation, no queſtion the
Plenipotentiaries of her Majeſty acted;
for firſt obliging the <hi>French</hi> to ſtand to it
on their part, they left it entirely to the
Determination of the Parliament, to
whom it would certainly occur, what
the value was they Exchanged, as well
on one Side as the other: If it be true
that the <hi>French</hi> have Wooll ſufficient for
their own Manufacturing, and both can
and do Manufacture ſufficient, not only
to ſupply their own Dominions, Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and Plantations, but alſo to Export
to other Nations, then it muſt certainly
be of no great Uſe to us to open a Trade
with them at all, becauſe there is no
Advantage to us in it, they having little
or no occaſion for the Manufactures
which we think to ſupply them with.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, If it be true that
the <hi>French</hi> upon taking off their new Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
revoking and repealing their Edicts
and Tarifs, will neceſſarily take off a
great quantity of our Manufactures; then
it cannot be true, as has been ſo warmly
ſuggeſted by ſame Writers, That the
<hi>French</hi> have go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>en the Manufacture into
their own Hands, and will not only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themſelves, but other Nations alſo.
On the other hand, <hi>France</hi> is a Country
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0386703500:29"/>
of a vaſt Extent, full of People, and if
they take our Manufactures for their own
Uſe, will take ſo great a quantity as we
can hardly Buy ſuch an Advantage too
Dear, and the reducing the Duties of
their Goods here; eſpecially as it is
mention'd in the Ninth Article of the
Treaty, may, or may not be a thing of
great Extent to them and to us too, as we
do or do not rightly manage it. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:</p>
            <p>What is it they ask of us? I ſee but two
things that are material in their Demand.
They ask (1.) That we ſhould Repeal all
our Prohibitions. And (2.) Reduce our
Additional Cuſtoms, which have been laid
upon their Goods ſince the Year 1664.
and they offer to do the like. Well ſays
our Merchants, What then muſt the
Cuſtoms of Wines and Brandies be no
more than in the Year 1664. that will
bring Claret down to the Price of Six
Pound, to Eight Pound a Hogſhhead
again, and the common Tavern Price
to One Shilling <hi>per</hi> Quart, and what then
will become of our <hi>Spainiſh</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi>
Wine Trade? The Article anſwers for
it ſelf in this Caſe, the miſtake is in the
Reader, not in the Expreſſion; for in
truth, there is nothing at all of ſuch a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0386703500:30"/>
reduction; but on the contrary, the
<hi>French</hi> are oblig'd to ſubmit to whatever
Duties we think fit to lay upon the Wine
and Brandy, as will appear more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culary
in the next Head: For the <hi>French</hi>
are wiſely brought down to conſent to this
Propoſal, <hi>viz.</hi> That their Wine ſhould
pay as much as the <hi>Portugal</hi> Wine, only
we join to admit, that it ſhall pay no
more, and yet the Complaint of our
People, againſt this Clauſe, is, <hi>ſo loud,</hi>
that the old Proportion of things can be
ill heard, and ſome People conlude, that
this equality will ruin the Trade of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
For, <hi>ſay they,</hi> The Inclination of
our People to <hi>French</hi> Wine is ſuch, that
if it be at the ſame price with the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi>
Wine, none will Drink the latter; and
therefore it is abſolutely neceſſary, that
the <hi>French</hi> Wine ſhould be laid under the
diſadvantage in their payment of Cuſtoms,
that the <hi>Portugal</hi> Wines may ſtill be
made the <hi>Common Draught,</hi> as it is called
through the Nation.</p>
            <p>To this there lies two Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ections.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it be true that upon opening the
<hi>French</hi> Trade as above, they will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
take our Manufactures in Return for
their Wines, then we have the ſame Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0386703500:31"/>
in both Trades, and ought to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
one as well as the other, and the
Reaſon is juſt that the Duties ſhould be
alike, and the Encouragements or Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
equal; if it be not ſo, then it
alters the Caſe: But then ſome other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
will be ill maintain'd, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
<hi>That the</hi> French <hi>have rejected our Trade to
ſet up the Manufactures among themſelves,
and plac'd high Duties on all our Goods,
without which they would be out-done, and
their own Manufactures Diſcouraged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade always paid
a leſs Duty than the <hi>French,</hi> is a great
miſtake, and conſequently it is a miſtake,
That it they are reduced to an Equality,
the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade will be ruin'd; for it
is apparent that from the Reſtoration to
the Revolution, being Twenty eight
years, and the Reign of two Kings, the
<hi>French</hi> Wines were always Charg'd at
above 6. 10 <hi>s. per</hi> Ton leſs Cuſtome
than the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Wines, which always
paid <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine Duties, and yet the
<hi>Portugueſe</hi> had a very conſiderable Trade
with us for Wine, and very far it was
from being loſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0386703500:32"/>
Again, We do not ſee that this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the <hi>French</hi> will help their Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Trade at all: For all they Demand is
that their Brandy ſhall pay no more Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
than the Brandy of other Nations, it
is but paſſing an Act then that the Brandy
from <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> or any other Nation, ſhall
pay as much as the <hi>French</hi> pay now, and
the Brandy Trade ſtands juſt where it was:
This is ſo eaſie to do, and of ſo little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
to us, that it cannot be Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
For all the Brandy that we Import
from <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> is ſo little, and ſo
ordinary, that it matters not to us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we Import any of it or no; and
what-ever then is wanting in the Import
of Brandy by reaſon of the high Duty,
will be made up in Malt and Melaſſes
Spirits, and ſo the Treaty of Commerce,
may be a means to preſerve the Diſtilling
Trade to us, which every one owns is of
the Greateſt Conſequence, and which
can be ſupported, humanly ſpeaking, no
other way.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plenipotentiaries fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
this, they acted very wiſely when
they brought the <hi>French</hi> to yield up that
Point, and not abſolutely Determine the
reducing the Duties to what they were
before the firſt War, which would have
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0386703500:33"/>
been very injurious to our Trade; if
they did not forſee it, the good Luck is
greater than the good Meaning; and it is
to be hoped the Commiſſioners who are
to Treat ſtill of farther Regulations, will
take care to make this Article of the
Brandy effectual.</p>
            <p>In this could we be Impartial in our
Judgment of things, we might ſee that
this Treaty of Commerce is made with
ſeveral advantageous Clauſes againſt the
<hi>French</hi> Trade, which none that ever paſt
before Contain'd, and in this particular it
is remarkably advantageous, That the
<hi>French</hi> are bound to take off all the Duties,
Cuſtoms, Tarifs, Edicts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſince 1664.
as by the Article; but we are only obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to provide by a Law that their
Goods pay no more than the Goods of
other Nations: So that if we pleaſe to
Charge the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Brandy, the <hi>Portugal</hi>
Reds, <hi>Malaga</hi> Whites, <hi>Florence, Galitia,</hi>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at 100 <hi>l. per</hi> Ton, the <hi>French</hi> muſt
pay the ſame.</p>
            <p>I would not be found putting a wrong
Conſtruction upon the Treaty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
upon the Treaters; but I leave
every Man to make his judgment from
the Words of the 9th Article, which run
thus:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0386703500:34"/>
               <q rend="inline">'It is farther Enacted, That within
the ſpace of two Months after, a Law
ſhall be made in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it ſhall be ſufficiently provided, That
no more Cuſtoms or Duties be paid for
Goods and Merchandizes brought from
<hi>France</hi> to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> than what are
payable for Goods and Merchandizes
<hi>of the like Nature</hi> Imported into <hi>Great-Britain</hi>
from any other Country in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>;
and that all Laws made in <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain</hi>
ſince the year 1664. for Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
the Importation of any Goods
and Merchandizes coming from <hi>France,</hi>
which were not Prohibited before that
time, be Repealed. The General Tarif

in the year 1664. ſhall take Place
there again, and the Duties payable in
<hi>France</hi> by the Subjects of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>
for Goods Imported and Exported,
ſhall be paid according to the Tenor of
the Tarif above mentioned, and ſhall
not exceed the Rule therein ſettled.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems plain here as Words can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
it, 1. That we are only to make a
Law or Act of Parliament, to reduce the
Duty of <hi>French</hi> Wines, and the Duty of
all other Country Wines, to the ſame
Rate, the like of Brandies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. That
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0386703500:35"/>
upon our doing this, upon our paſſing
this Law, or within two Months after it,
the <hi>French</hi> are obliged to admit our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Goods upon the Foot of the Tarif of
1664. and to Repeal all the Additions of
Taxes. Cuſtoms or Duties Whatſoever
which have been laid ſince that time, to
the Rate they were at before.</p>
            <p>I believe this part of the Article has not
been Conſidered as it might have been
by moſt People, and if it had, perhaps ſo
many would not blindfold have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd

eaſily rectified, and the People will be

               </gap>t upon their Weakneſs.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, the Treaty, like
other things of ſo nice a nature, gives
many People uneaſineſs at firſt ſight,
for want of rightly underſtanding the
intent and meaning of it, and to others,
for want of Conſidering rightly what they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0386703500:36"/>
do underſtand of it: The Conditions of
it are evidently to the Advantage of the

            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0386703500:37"/>
And that we may a little open the
Eyes of the Commons about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for they ſeem to be the moſt affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Danger from it; a Word or
two may be neceſſary to ſay to them:</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the Woollen Manufacturers:
It has been for many Years the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
That the <hi>French</hi> have Prohibited
our Woollen Manufacture; That they
have put a ſtop to our Trade; That
the <hi>Dutch</hi> have a great Trade to <hi>France,</hi>
               <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> who make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
quantities of our kinds of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures,
ſend them into <hi>France,</hi> and
ours are Prohibited, and the like: The
Government having now made an Eſſay
to Remedy this Evil, and to open a
Trade for our Manufactures, We ſeem
agriev'd, and as much offended the other
way; becauſe by opening this Trade
with them the Silk Trade and the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi>
Wine Trade will be touch'd. But look
into your Woollen Manufacture Trade, if
opening a Trade with <hi>France</hi> Gives you
a Free Market in ſo large a Country
where you had none before, Shall not
this Encreaſe the Conſumption of the
Woollen Manufacture? And is not that
of infinitely more vallue than what we
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0386703500:38"/>
ſpeak of againſt it? Every one agrees
that our Woollen Manufacture is the Life
and Soul of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade, and if
this be but forwarded and promoted,
whatever other Trade ſuffers, it is able
ſufficiently to make us amends for that
Loſs: The Employment of Families is
this way, and perhaps this way only to
be ſupplied. If it were poſſible that
other Manufactures could be Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd,
and this be Preſerv'd, we ſhould
all be pleas'd and ſatisfied: But this
muſt be Preſerv'd, muſt be Encourag'd,
muſt be Extended, what-ever riſque
we run of the reſt. Either <hi>France</hi> will,
<hi>upon the making this Treaty Effectual,</hi> take
off a very great quantity of our Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Manufactures, or it will not; <hi>if it
will not,</hi> Why do we deſire a Treaty of
Commerce at all? Why do we Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that the <hi>French</hi> have Prohibited
Trade with us? <hi>If it will,</hi> if the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
for our Manufactures will be great
in <hi>France,</hi> then what are we Diſſatisfied
at? and why is not the Treaty now
made our Advantage? Let thoſe People
who argue againſt it Compare the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of an Encreaſe of our Wollen
Manufacture, with all the Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
to other Trades, and ſee whether
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0386703500:39"/>
the Benefit on one hand is not ſuch,
that the Loſs on the other hand ought
to be riſqu'd for it.</p>
            <p>But here comes in our Complaining
Crouds with Petitions and mournful
Repreſentations, That their Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
will be ruin'd; the <hi>Colcheſter</hi>
poor People, as I have been told, are
particularly alarm'd, and yet it was
never heard that the <hi>French</hi> ever went
about to make a Piece of Bays in this
World, no, nor are they able to do it,
they know the impracticableneſs of it.
What then can be the Diſſatisfaction
that can affect that ſide! I might
name ſundry other People who are
Employed in Manufactures in <hi>England,</hi>
eſpecially thoſe which depend upon the
goodneſs of the Wooll, whether the
Fineneſs, or the Length of the Staple:
The Petitions therefore of theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
if they come, ought to expreſs
that their Apprehenſions of the <hi>French</hi>
are grounded upon ſufficient Evidence
of Fact, ſuch as, That they have already
attempted, or are likely to attempt the
making Bays in <hi>France,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0386703500:40"/>
It were then to be wiſh'd, ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
would calculate a little from juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
what quantity of Manufactures
<hi>France</hi> has uſually taken from us, when
we Traded with them upon the Foot
of the Tarif of 1664. and what it is
probable they may take again, if mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
return to that Channel; and
then it would be ſeen what price we
ought to bid, in Order to reſtore the
Trade to that Rule of Taxation; and
what ſuch a purchaſe would be worth
in our other Trade, which, as they ſay,
we muſt give in Exchange for it; and
this would be a very good way to make
a right Judgment of the thing, for, as
is ſaid before, either our Goods will
find a Sale in <hi>France,</hi> or they will not;
if they will, it is certainly our Intereſt
to procure the Trade to be open, and
though it ſhould hurt us a little in ſome
other branches of our Commerce, the
loſs would not be felt, <hi>at leaſt,</hi> not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to move us to prevent it, becauſe
of the Profit of the Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
which is our main Support and
Dependency.</p>
            <p>This brings me to mention the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of thoſe who are concern'd in the
Silk Manufactures, which is the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0386703500:41"/>
to the other. Theſe People are
made to believe, that they ſhall Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
not ſuffer only, but be ruin'd; and
they talk already of ſuch a ſtop to the
Weaving, that I know not how many
Journey-men Weavers (more I believe
by a great many than there are in the
whole Broad Weaving Trade) are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
turn'd off, and out of Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I do acknowledge it is a hard and
melancholly Circumſtance when any
publick Tranſaction ſo claſhes the parts
of the Body, I mean the Body of the
Nation, that one can hardly live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Deſtruction of the other, and
yet as I ſaid above, the Woollen Trade
is ſo great, that there is no compariſon
between it and the Silk Manufacture;
neither muſt the preſervation of the one
be ſet in competition, when the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the other is the immediate
Queſtion: But what if after all the
Melancholly things which have been ſaid
upon this Subject, it ſhould appear, that
the Silk Manufacture in <hi>England</hi> may
be preſerv'd and ſupported in a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency
with the preſent Treaty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
and particularly with that part
of the Ninth Article, which Conditions
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0386703500:42"/>
for the taking off the Prohibitions upon
the <hi>French</hi> Goods Imported into <hi>England.</hi>
This is a Point few have touch'd upon;
but I make no queſtion, it may be farther
handled in time; and thoſe Perſons,
whoever they ſhall be, who ſhall be
employ'd by the Government to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Duties of the two Naions,
and to remove the difficulties that
may be in the way, cannot be ſo
Deſtitute, as to want a proper medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
for the claſhing Intereſts between
the Silk Manufactures of each King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as well as for that of the Woollen.</p>
            <p>If then the Woollen Manufacture be
encreaſed, and the Silk not diminiſhed,
the Woollen advanced, and the Silk not
diſcouraged, Men muſt be very much
at a loſs to find out wherein the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
or Intricacy of the Ninth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the Treaty of Commerce does
conſiſt.</p>
            <p>The miſsfortune lies in the difficulty
there is to open the Eyes of the Poor
People, who are ſeverally employ'd in
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures, whether of
Silk or Wooll, both which, for ought
I ſee, are equally allarm'd, and equally
poſſeſs'd with apprehenſions of their
Trade being ruin'd by the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0386703500:43"/>
But all popular Diſatisfactions are
allay'd by time, the care of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
will be to prevent the real
Miſchiefs, and the Fears of the People
will wear off in the experiment, when
the Woollen Manufacturers ſhall ſee
that a greater quantity of Goods are
Vended than uſed to be, and the Silk
Manufacturers ſhall ſee, that as many
Looms are employ'd as were before,
then the Folly and Blindneſs of their
preſent apprehenſions will abate, and
they will Peaceably acknowledge that
that were miſtaken.</p>
