            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE averſion a woman ought to feel at the neceſſity of engaging even in a literary conteſt has induced me to endure a variety of imputations; yet, to publiſh a piece, and leave all unanſwered, might at once give a ſanction to the paſt, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage future ſlanders:—let this plead my excuſe for introducing myſelf to thoſe who have ſo generouſly received a comedy I would wiſh more worthy their patronage.</p>
            <p>Charged early in life with the care of a family, I accompanied my father eight years ago into the rules of a priſon, where the perjury of an enemy, and the injuſtice of a judge for a time confined him. To amuſe ſome of my melancholy leiſure, I there (from a fondneſs for Marmontel's beautiful tale of Lauretta) firſt conceived the deſign of introducing into the Drama a female heart, capable of frailty, yet ſhuddering at vice, and perhaps ſufficiently puniſhed in her own feelings. A lover, whoſe error was likewiſe in his heart, not head; and even for him I contrived a chaſtiſement in the agony of loſing her: nor did I imagine, in adopting a religious te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, I could ever be accuſed of offending morality. Subſequent characters and incidents aroſe in the manner they now appear, except that the governor had then no place in it. It is now ſeven years ſince the piece was brought thus forward; ſoon after which a friend lent me a tranſlation of Monſieur Diderot's Pere de Famille.—This fine performance gave me infinite pleaſure under all the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a tranſlation; and the chance-ſimilitude
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0057901500:5"/>
which now and then occurred between that and mine rather flattered than grieved me, ſince, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of my own originality, and imagining even my worſt enemy, if he charged me with a plagiariſm, would at leaſt allow, while the ſubject was new to our ſtage, my only crime was in denying it.—I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the tranſlated play, and mine lay dormant ſeveral years. Sentiment was now exploded, and I therefore ſought to diverſify it with humour. The character of the auſtere Commander in Monſieur Diderot's play had particularly pleaſed me; and not being miſtreſs of the French language, I ſought in vain for a tranſlation, on purpoſe to interweave him into mine. Not able to meet with any, I created the character of Governor Harcourt, whoſe chief likeneſs to the French uncle is in name) and heightened the piece with every event relative to him: but an unbounded partiality I muſt ever retain for muſic made me finiſh it as a three act opera.</p>
            <p>In the interim my father had been engaged as a capital Actor by Mr. Harris. Life opened gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon me, and diſſipated the illuſions of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. I learnt that merit merely is a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient recommendation to managers in general; and as I had neither a proſtituted pen or perſon to offer Mr. Harris, I gave up, without a trial, all thoughts of the Drama, and ſought an humble home in Bath, reſolving to bury in my own heart its little talent, and be a poor any thing rather than a poor author. Some valuable friends, I had long poſſeſſed there, inſiſted I ſhould be wanting to myſelf in conſigning this piece voluntarily to oblivion, and offered me a recommendation to Mr. Harris, with a promiſe of concealing my name, unleſs it was accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I could deſire nothing more: and under theſe circumſtances it was put into that gentleman's
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0057901500:6"/>
hands above a twelvemonth ago. The praiſes he gave it induced my friend to own my name, and from that moment (let his conſcience tell him why) it ſunk in Mr. Harris's favour. He ſaid he had frequently refuſed a play of Mr. Macklin's taken from le Pere de Famille, and could not accept an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other on the ſame ſubject; inſiſted, that the ſerious part of mine was all Diderot's; adviſed me to cut it entirely out, and convert the humorous part into an after-piece, which be would bring out in the courſe of the ſeaſon.—Reaſons very remote from the Stage could alone induce me to liſten a moment to his propoſal, and thoſe brought me a hundred miles to converſe with him on the ſubject; when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me the copy ſent him, ſo worn out and dirty, that I had reaſon to conclude he had lent it to every one he knew, at leaſt.—I was enough miſtreſs of myſelf to liſten with complaiſance to the moſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious and unmeaning criticiſms, and agreed to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilate it according to his ideas. The Actors were now named. I had every reaſon to imagine it a ſettled thing; and returning to Bath, ſent the reduced copy at the appointed time, viz. early in September. A month elapſed without my even knowing he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it; when, with the continued ill-manners of addreſſing me by a third perſon, (for he never wrote a ſingle line in anſwer to ſeveral letters) I was ſhewn a paragraph from Mr. Harris by the friend already mentioned, importing, that I "had ſent him <hi>four</hi> acts inſtead of <hi>two,</hi> and muſt ſtill take away half; adding, that he adviſed me by all means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my own, diſregarding Diderot's."—I did retain my own; for, as the manuſcript was luckily returned for another alteration, I thought it time to conſider what was due to myſelf, and that the character of mildneſs and complacency would be rather dearly
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0057901500:7"/>
bought if I gave up all merit for it; I therefore wrote him a civil letter, and finally withdrew it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not expatiate on this treatment. I was perhaps in ſome degree blameable, for believing that man would ſet any value on my time or my money, who knew not the value of his own; nay, I may be in reality obliged to him in one ſenſe, ſince his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of my Comedy would inevitably have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to oblivion thoſe parts of it honored with the moſt laviſh applauſe.</p>
            <p>What pleaſure do I feel in retracting the general aſperſion caſt upon managers, when I ſpeak of Mr. Colman—Obliged to get the piece repreſented if poſſible, leſt the ſubject ſhould be borrowed (an evil too common of late) I encloſed it with an anonymous letter to that Gentleman, briefly relating theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and it was left at his houſe early in the year by an unknown perſon. At the expiration of a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night the manuſcript or his anſwer was demanded, and the latter by this means rendered both impartial and deciſive. Mr. Colman thought the general name of Author entitled to the compliment of his own hand-writing; and, by a flattering opinion, and immediate acceptance of my piece, encouraged me to avow myſelf. By his advice I cut out the ſongs, and lengthened it into five acts. Nor did his kindneſs end there. He gave me the benefit of his judgment and experience, both in heightening and abbreviating the buſineſs, with every attention in caſting and getting it up; generouſly uniting to the name of Manager that of Friend Mr. Colman has brought into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice a woman who will ever with pride and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure acknowledge the obligation.</p>

Becauſe it was not provoking enough to lounge away a whole ſummer in the country, here am I driven up to town, as if the devil was at my heels in the ſhape of our hopeful heir; who has neither ſuffered my Lord nor me to reſt one moment, thro' his confounded impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to ſee his uncle.</p>

                  <p>Umph,—he'll have enough of the old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman preſently. He is the very moral of my poor dear lady, his ſiſter, who never was at peace herſelf, nor ſuffer'd any one elſe to be ſo. Such a houſe as we have had ever ſince he came!—why he is more full of importance and airs than a bailiff in poſſeſſion; and hectors over Miſs Mortimer, 'till ſhe almoſt keeps her chamber to avoid him.</p>

                  <p>Hate her? ay, that he does. He look'd, as if he could have kill'd her, the moment ſhe came down to ſee him; and got into his chamber preſently after, where he ſends for me.—"Who is this young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Mrs. What's your name?" ſays he. Why, ſir, ſays I, ſhe is the orphan of a Colonel Mortimer, whoſe intimacy with my Lord, ſays I—"Pho, pho, ſays he, all that I know, woman; what does ſhe do in this houſe?" ſays he; his face wrinkling all over,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0057901500:13"/>
like cream when it's ſkimming. Why, ſir, ſays I, her father unluckily died, juſt before the Duke his brother, and ſo could not leave her one ſhilling of all that fine fortune; ſo my Lord intends to marry her to Mr. Woodville, ſays I.—"He does? cries he; heav'n be prais'd I'm come in time to mar that dainty project, however. You may go, woman, and tell Miſs, I don't want any thing more to-night."—So up goes I to Miſs Mortimer, and tells her all this. Lord! how glad ſhe was, to find he intended to break the match, tho' ſhe can't gueſs what he means.</p>

                  <p>I have; you ſaw her on your arrival, I ſuppoſe, for I left her in town to attend a ſick aunt. Poor Mortimer!—he died one month before the Duke his brother, and miſſed a fine title and eſtate. You know how I loved the honeſt fellow, and cannot won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I took home his orphan'd daughter, as a match for Woodville.</p>

                  <speaker>Gov.</speaker>
                  <p>Brother, brother! you are too generous; it is your foible, and artful people know how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it to their own advantage.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Glen.</speaker>
                  <p>It is, if a foible, the nobleſt incident to humanity. Sophia has birth, merit, accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and wants nothing but money to qualify her for any rank.</p>

                  <p>Can ſhe have a worſe want on earth? Birth, merit, accompliſhments, are the very things that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der money more eſſential: if ſhe had been brought up in a decent plain way indeed,—but ſhe has the airs of a peereſs already; and, if any philoſopher doubts of the perpetual motion, I would adviſe him to watch the knocker of your houſe. Then you have, out of your preciſe decorums, removed your ſon, to make way for this flirt of faſhion; and what is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of rendering him thus early his own maſter?</p>

                  <p>If you run on thus, only to divert your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with all my heart; but, if you would throw a real imputation on Miſs Mortimer's conduct, ſhe is entitled to my ſerious defence. I never ſaw any good ariſe from ſecluding young people; and authoriſe Woodville and Sophia to live with that innocent ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, which renders ev'ry rank eaſy, and prevents pleaſure from ſeducing the heart, or ignorance the ſenſes.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I am amazed at you! was there ever yet a woman who didn't mean to paſs for a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs? Do they not gain upon us continually, 'till nothing of our prerogative remains but the name? We are wiſe fellows truly, if we do not keep down this humour of theirs as long as poſſible, by breeding them in retirement. Every tinſel fop will find addreſs enough to convince wife ſhe is an angel; and the huſband muſt be lucky, as well as ſenſible, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles her to treatment ſo inferior to her deſerts. Woodville will agree with me, I dare ſay; for the character ſuits with his intended; and, 'faith, he will

make but a modiſh huſband, or he could not endure to ſee her flying about, like the queen-bee with the whole hive at her heels.</p>

                  <p>That's true, indeed!—if I wrong her, and this was but an inſult,—there is a noble ſincerity in her own letter which ſets ſuſpicion at defiance.—If he ſtumbled on one word of truth during this viſit, the criſis of my fate approaches.—Oh, wherever thou art, if the exalted being I will ſtill hope my Cecilia, thou ſhalt I know I have at leaſt deſerv'd thee!
