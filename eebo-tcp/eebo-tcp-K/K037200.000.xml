            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <lg>
               <l>THE time hath been, but in a barbarous age,</l>
               <l>When poets brav'd their audience from the ſtage,</l>
               <l>Poets pontifical, whoſe lofty tone</l>
               <l>Acknowledg'd no tribunal but their own,</l>
               <l>And ſent their Prologue-purveyor to raiſe</l>
               <l>Firſt fruits and fines of tributary praiſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Our modern bards are taught an humbler ſtrain,</l>
               <l>And, if leſs valiant, are not half ſo vain;</l>
               <l>No longer aim the nation's taſte to lead,</l>
               <l>Content if they can follow and ſucceed.</l>
               <l>Thus if the time ſhould come, when in the place</l>
               <l>Of Nature you ſhou'd ſubſtitute grimace,</l>
               <l>(Fatal reverſe!) What cou'd the Poet do?</l>
               <l>Offend the many to appeaſe the few?</l>
               <l>No, if in Greece true taſte had been as ſcarce,</l>
               <l>The Stagyrite himſelf had ſtood for farce.</l>
               <l>If wit thro' five long acts will not hold out,</l>
               <l>Momus muſt help to ſtir the laugh about,</l>
               <l>And when you crown his mummery with applauſe,</l>
               <l>You bribe him to tranſgreſs the drama's laws.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He were a very wild romantic elf,</l>
               <l>Who only wrote to figure on the ſhelf;</l>
               <l>To hear his own ſad ſentiments rebound</l>
               <l>Thro' empty galleries with a dying ſound,</l>
               <l>And ſit like Seneca in calm decay,</l>
               <l>Watching how life ſteals drop by drop away:</l>
               <l>No, let him take his profit and his eaſe,</l>
               <l>And trifle on ſo long as trifles pleaſe:</l>
               <l>Too weak to ſtruggle againſt faſhion's tide,</l>
               <l>If with the current he's content to glide,</l>
               <l>He only yields as Caeſar did before,</l>
               <l>When Tiber's torrent drove him from the ſhore.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The ſimple tale we have to tell this night,</l>
               <l>Shews truth triumphant over ranc'rous ſpite,</l>
               <l>Caſts in dark ſhades the baſe defamer's part,</l>
               <l>And crowns with juſt reward the liberal heart.</l>
               <l>Oh might our efforts gain their wiſht for end,</l>
               <l>The gay to' amuſe, the faulty to amend,</l>
               <l>Make fiction rule her thoughts by nature's laws,</l>
               <l>And wit exert her powers in virtue's cauſe,</l>
               <l>Then and then only might we claim applauſe.</l>

I tell you it is all up with him: lawyer Earling has done his buſineſs. If ever he enters my lady's doors, or touches a ſhilling of her fortune while he breathes, ſet me down for a fool and a falſe prophet.</p>

                  <p>I'll tell you then. Had my aunt bequeath'd to me her fortune, ſhe wou'd have probably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted me from marrying Emily; having given it to Emily, ſhe has doubtleſs tied her up from marrying me. Had ſhe done neither one nor the other, I have enough to maintain her, and the prize had been my own.</p>

                  <p>Very true; lay it aſide altogether; it will bring a plaguy deal of miſchief upon me, and do no good to you.</p>

                  <p>You'll comprehend it at once. There is a proper valet to be hir'd for the heireſs, fit to wait upon her perſon, and grace the back of her chair at table.</p>

                  <speaker>Alg.</speaker>
                  <p>I can't do it; I am not equal to the taſk; I can't approach ſo near, and yet refrain. When ſhe ſpoke to me, I ſhou'd be loſt; when ſhe look'd on me, I ſhou'd betray myſelf; and when I hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her the plate, I ſhould preſent it on my knee.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Scud.</speaker>
                  <p>Aye, then you wou'd be vollied out of the window, and I kick'd out of the doors. Now, ſilly Jenny, what's become of your project?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Alg.</speaker>
                  <p>Hold there! tho' dangerous in the extreme it is not altogether deſperate. If I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the offices you deſcribe, I may yet preſent myſelf as a candidate for her ſervice; and in that character perhaps obtain an interview with my charmer. That hope is worth an effort.</p>

One evening I had rambled about a mile from home, when upon entering a little copſe, thro' which my footpath led, judge of my horror, when a villain, ſuch I muſt call him, ſurpriz'd me, ſeiz'd me, and in ſpite of cries, prayers and entreaties—</p>

                  <p>Exquiſite creature! I'm enchanted with her. By heaven! 'twould be the heighth of my ambition, the object I have moſt at heart in life, to ſee my Lionel—Oh that I cou'd!—here kneeling at her feet.—Born of ſuch parents, train'd by ſuch inſtructions, and grac'd with charms ſo lovely, Emily, without a fortune, is a match for princes.</p>

                  <p>No, I regard a duelliſt with horror; I hold him as an agent of the enemy of mankind, ſent to diſturb ſociety, and rend the parent's and the widow's hearts aſunder: one action, one only action, and that a doubtful one, had met my ear in favour of that wretch whom I call nephew, and henceforth even that one I totally diſcredit, and renounce him.</p>

                  <p>Hold, I conjure you. In the midſt of wrath let us remember juſtice. I, like you, abhor a duelliſt profeſt; yet I am taught by long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience how to make allowances for younger ſpirits, and warmer paſſions, that will not ſubmit to meet the world's contempt, and ſcorn its prejudices.</p>

                  <p>I will. Your nephew has had an affair with Mr. Algernon, and is wounded. You have viſited him no doubt. Has he related to you the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of that unpleaſant buſineſs?</p>

If you muſt now fall back into your ſtation, it is not that I have withdrawn my favour from you, but from your miſtreſs.</p>

                  <p>Aye, and in the county too, when it ſhall be known that you have forfeited my lady's favour by ſpeaking up for Mr. Algernon; he is ſo much pitied and belov'd by all men, that your neighbours will ſham ſick on purpoſe to employ you.</p>

                  <p>Forgive me, my good lady, if I come to atone to you and this fair advocate for my unjuſt ſuſpicions of your nephew. I have one here waiting, who'll confront that gentleman, his accuſer, and, I truſt, remove ſome falſe impreſſions that your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may have imbibed from his unfounded charges. Come in, ſir, if you pleaſe.</p>

                  <p>He firſt came here humbly to aſk for ſervice, pleaded decay, and ſaid he was a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by birth; I pitied him, and offer'd him relief.

Theſe are ſuſpicious circumſtances, and I ſhou'd have ſome better reaſons for believing him than I am yet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of. Do you know any ſuch, Sir Oliver?</p>
