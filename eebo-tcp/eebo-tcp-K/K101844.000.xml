            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>CHARLES, here are more ſtories for you,—ſtories about good boys, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0466101800:3"/>
naughty boys, and ſilly boys; for you know what it is to be good now. And there is a ſtory about two fooliſh Cocks that were always quarrelling, which is very naughty. You do not quarrel? No. I am glad of it; but if you ſee any little boys that quarrel you may tell
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0466101800:4"/>
them the ſtory of the Two Cocks. This is it:</p>
               <p>There was once a Hen who lived in a farm-yard, and ſhe had a large brood of chickens. She took a great deal of care of them, and gathered them under her wings every night, and fed them, and nurſed them
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0466101800:5"/>
very well: and they were all very good, except two Cocks, that were always quarrelling with one another. They were hardly out of the ſhell before they began to peck at each other; and when they grew bigger they fought till they were all bloody. If one picked
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0466101800:6"/>
up a barley-corn the other always wanted to have it. They never looked pretty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their feathers were pulled off in fighting till they were quite bare; and they picked at one another's eyes till they were both almoſt blind. The old Hen very often told them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0466101800:7"/>
how naughty it was to quarrel ſo; but they did not mind her.</p>
               <p>So one day theſe two Cocks had been fighting, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways did; and the biggeſt Cock, whoſe name was Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticleer, beat the other, and crowed over him, and drove
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0466101800:8"/>
him quite out of the yard. The Cock that had been beat ſlunk away and hid himſelf; for he was vexed he had been conquered, and he wanted ſadly to be revenged; but he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ough himſelf. So, after
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0466101800:9"/>
thinking a great deal, he went to an old ſly Fox that lived near, and ſaid to him, Fox, if you will come with me I will ſhew you where there is a large fat Cock in a farm-yard, and you may cat him up if you will. The Fox was very glad, for he was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0466101800:10"/>
hungry enough; and he ſaid, Yes, I will come with all my heart, and I will not leave a feather of him. So they went together, and the Cock ſhewed Reynard the way into the farm-yard; and there was poor Chanticleer aſleep upon the perch. And
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0466101800:11"/>
the Fox ſeized him by the neck, and ate him up; and the other Cock ſtood by and crowed for joy. But when the Fox had done, he ſaid, Chanticleer was very good, but I have not had enough; and ſo he flew upon the other
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0466101800:12"/>
Cock, and ate him up too in a moment.</p>

               <p>I will tell you a ſtory.</p>
               <p>There was a little boy whoſe name was Harry; and his papa and mamma ſent
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0466101800:13"/>
him to ſchool. Now Harry was a clever fellow, and loved his book; and he got to be firſt in his claſs. So his mamma got up one morning very early and called Betty the maid, and ſaid, Betty, I think we muſt make a cake for Harry, for he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0466101800:14"/>
has learned his book very well. And Betty ſaid, Yes, with all my heart. So they made a nice cake. It was very large, and ſtuffed full of plums and ſweetmeats, orange and citron; and it was iced all over with ſugar: it was white and ſmooth on
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0466101800:15"/>
the top like ſnow. So this cake was ſent to the ſchool. When little Harry ſaw it he was very glad, and jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about for joy, and he hardly ſtayed for a knife to cut a piece, but gnawed it like a little dog. So he ate till the bell rang for ſchool, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0466101800:16"/>
after ſchool he ate again, and ate till he went to bed; nay, his bed-fellow told me that he laid his cake under his pillow, and ſat up in the night to eat ſome. So he ate till it was all gone.—But preſently after this little boy was very ſick and ill,

and every body ſaid, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what is the matter with Harry—he uſed to be ſo briſk, and play about more nimbly than any of the boys; and now he looks pale and is very ill. And ſomebody ſaid, Harry has had a rich cake, and eat it all up very

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0466101800:26"/>
was blind, he had a little dog in a ſtring to lead him. So he came into the court, and ſat down upon a ſtone, and ſaid, My pretty lads, if you will, I will play you a tune. And they all left off their ſport, and came and ſtood round him. And
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0466101800:27"/>
Billy ſaw that while he play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tears ran down his cheeks. And Billy ſaid, Old man, why do you cry?

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0466101800:48"/>
it would drown you if you were as tall as two church ſteeples. I wonder what they call this great water! there is an old, old fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſitting upon a ſtone drying himſelf; for he is very wet. I think we will aſk him. Pray, fiſherman,

what is this great water? It is the Sea: did you never hear of the ſea? What! is this great water the ſame ſea that is in our map at home? Yes, it is. Well, this is very ſtrange! we are come to the ſea that is in our map. But it is very little in the

               <p>Pray, Fiſherman, is there any thing on the other ſide of this ſea? Yes; fields,

tell you what, little boy! they are made on purpoſe to go over the ſea; and the wind blows them along faſter than a horſe can trot. What do they call them? They call them Ships. You have ſeen a ſhip in a picture. Shall we get in? What have

               <p>Now we are upon the great ſea. Blow, blow wind! Sail away ſhip! There are little rooms in the ſhip. Thoſe little rooms are called cabins. Let us walk about,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0466101800:57"/>
and look at the ſhip. Why, you cannot walk ſteady: I am afraid you are tipſy! Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſhip rolls about. But the ſailors can walk ſteady. The ſea is not like the river; it is greeniſh. Well; here is water enough if we ſhould be thirſty. Yes, here
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0466101800:58"/>
is water enough; but you would not like to drink it. It is ſalt and bitter. You could not drink it. How faſt we go! Now the fields are a great way off. Now we cannot ſee any green fields at all, nor any houſes, nor any thing but the great

England. And the deep ſea is between France and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land? Yes, you know it is ſo in the map.</p>
               <p>O, France is a pretty place It is warmer than our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: and here are pretty flowers, and fine fruit, and large grapes. I never ſaw
