            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Why, you muſt know, we are to have an election ſhortly for the county that I live in, which young Lord Turnabout wants to carry for one of his own gang; and as the election in a great meaſure depends upon my intereſt, the young fox, knowing the conceit and vanity of my wife, has taken her by her favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite ſoible, and tickled it up, by telling her that if I direct my intereſt properly, it would not be difficult to procure me a title. Now, ſir, this piece of flattery has ſtirred up ſuch a rage of quality and title in her giddy head, that I cannot reſt night or day for her importunity—in ſhort, ſhe would have me deſert my friends, and ſell myſelf, my honour, and my country, as ſeveral others have done before me, merely for a title, only that ſhe may take place of a parcel of fooliſh idle women, and ſink the antient name of Dogherty in the upſtart title of Lady Thingum, my Lady Fiddle F addle, or ſome ſuch ridiculous nonſenſe.</p>

                  <p>Why the name of this cuckold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker is Muſhroom, but from his conceit and impertinence, the women and jokers of this town have dignified him with the title of Count Muſhroom. Sir, he is the ſon of a pawn-broker in London, who having a mind to make a gentleman of his ſon, ſent him to the univerſity
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0149200100:12"/>
of Oxford; where, by mixing in the follies and vices of irregular youth, he got into a moſt ſanguine friendſhip with young Lord Old-Caſtle, who you know has a large eſtate in this country, and of whoſe anceſtors mine have held long and profitable leaſes, which are now near ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring—in ſhort, ſir, this ſame Count Muſhroom and my Lord became the Pylades and Oreſtes of the age, and ſo very fond was my Lord of him, that out of ſheer friendſhip to the Count, he got his ſiſter with child.</p>

                  <p>O yes, it was what you may call modern friendſhip, taſte, and bun tun; and my Lord being a man of gratitude, in return made him his agent in this country, and ſent him over to ſettle his affairs here. And the Count and I being in treaty to renew the leaſes with my Lord, and we not being able to agree upon the terms, the coxcomb ſends my wife a warm billedoux, in which he very gallantly tells her, that ſhe ſhall decide the difference between us, and ſettle the leaſes at her own price, only upon the trifling condition that he may be permitted now and then to be the occaſional lord of her ladyſhip's matrimonial manor.</p>

                  <p>O immenſely, ſir—it is a damn'd fine country, ſir — and excellent claret — excellent claret upon my honour! 'tis true indeed it is not ſuch claret as we drink in London—however, upon the whole, it's a pretty, neat, light, ſoft, ſilky, palateable wine, and I like it mightily—but your fiſh in this here country is horrid. There you want taſte, Hamilton—that there is an article of the ſcavoir vivre, in which you are totally ignorant—quite barbarous—</p>

Can there be any thing more provoking to a woman of my teeſt and ſpirit, than to hear the titles of a parcel of upſtart ugly creatures bawled in one's ears upon every occaſion—my Lady Kinnegad's coach there—my Lady Kilgobbin's chair there—my Lady Caſteknock's ſervants there—my Lady Tanderagee's chariot there. And after all theſe titles only conſider how my vile neem founds—

You croſs me in every thing, you are always finding fault with my routs, and my drums, and my fancy ball—t'other night you would not make up a dreſs for it, nor appear at it—O fie, fie, fie—but you are true Iriſh to the very bone of you.</p>

                  <p>O my dear, I tell you again and again, that the Engliſh can never be precedent to us. They, by their genius and conſtitution, muſt always run mad about ſomething or other, either about burlettas, pantomimes, a man in a bottle, a Cock-lane ghoſt, or ſomething of equal importance. But, my dear, they can afford to run mad after ſuch nonſenſe; why they owe more money than we are worth; ſtay 'till we are as rich as they are, and then we may be allowed to run mad after abſurdities as well as they.</p>

                     <p>It is very true, but his prettineſs will be his ruin; for as he makes it his buſineſs and his glory to win the affections of women, wherever he goes, and as he has made conqueſts of ſeveral married women in this town, there are half a dozen huſbands of us that have agreed to poiſon him.</p>
