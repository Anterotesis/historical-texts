            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SO many different opinions having of late
been offered to the public concerning
the cauſe of the preſent advanced price of
proviſions, ſome attributing it to the engroſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and monopolizing of land, others to
luxury, others again to regraters and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallers;
I cannot forbear giving my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on theſe ſubjects, as I think the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
arguments I have met with are by
no means ſatisfactory; but ſuch as, in
many inſtances, may tend to miſlead my
countrymen, and inflame the imaginations
of that claſs, who, on ſuch occaſions, often
become riotous, and dangerous to a ſtate.
When this is the caſe, it is ſurely incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on every one who thinks he has it in
his power, to ſet ſuch authors right where
it may appear they have been miſinformed;
I ſhall therefore not ſcruple, though unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to the preſs, to refute theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:0398000400:3"/>
in the manner which my profeſſion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables
me to do. Accordingly, I ſhall in the
following ſheets endeavour to point out the
real cauſes of ſcarcity, and at the ſame time
offer ſuch remedies as appear to me capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of producing the deſired effect; I
mean regular and moderate prices of
proviſions.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the article of mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polizing
land, as that ſeems to be the
moſt general topic of the preſent times.
The evil tendency of this has been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to be explained by ſeveral writers,
whoſe plauſible arguments may miſlead
thoſe who are not converſant in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and management of different ſoils,
and who therefore give credit to every
abſurdity; for if the ſubject ſavours of
compaſſion, it is popular, and carries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
though it is not underſtood.</p>

AN
INQUIRY
INTO THE
Connection between the preſent advanced
PRICE OF PROVISIONS,
AND THE
SIZE OF FARMS.</head>
         <div n="1" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAPTER I. ON MONOPOLIZING LAND.</head>
            <p>TO proceed with all poſſible candor
in my inveſtigation of this ſubject,
I ſhall enumerate the many evils which are
ſaid to ariſe from the monopolizing of land,
whereby it is ſuppoſed the preſent ſcarcity
is artificially produced. A cool examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of facts will probably ſhew us, whether
this practice bears any, and what ſhare in
the calamity we complain of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0398000400:7"/>
It is ſaid, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That large farmers, by
growing opulent, become negligent of their
buſineſs; that they, conſequently, do not
cultivate their lands to ſo much advantage
as they might, and that by this means their
produce is leſs than that of an equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of land in the hands of many ſmall
farmers, who, with their families, did the
chief of the work themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That large farmers, being opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
are not under the neceſſity of bringing
their corn to market, but retain it, to the
great diſtreſs of the poor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That our markets are not ſo
well ſupplied with pigs, poultry, butter,
and eggs, as when there were ſmall far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
whoſe wives attended the markets
with thoſe articles, which rendered the
price of butcher's meat cheap.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That large farms are the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of depopulation, whereby the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of labourers is ſo much diminiſhed,
that, in ſome places, there are ſcarcely
hands ſufficient to till the ground; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that the cropping of the land is
neglected, and the harveſt badly got in;
both which muſt diminiſh the quantity,
and enhance the price of corn.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0398000400:8"/>
               <head>SECTION I. The national benefit of proper ſized farms.</head>
               <p>IN anſwer to the firſt of the foregoing
objections againſt large farms, I ſhall
ſet out with laying down a principle in
which I am confident all parties will agree;
it is, that the produce of the earth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in tin, lead, iron, corn, or wool, is the
riches of our nation; and therefore, that
however thoſe articles may be obtained, it
is the quantity that is the only national
object. Farther, that whatever the article
is, the ſurplus of what is wanted will be
locally a drug in real value or eſtimation,
till converted to its proper uſe; if lead or
iron, it will be ſold to purchaſe neceſſaries;
if corn, we ſhall conſume what is neceſſary
for our ſupport, and the ſurplus will be
ſold for other commodities which we may
require: at all events, it is the quantity
to be produced which the nation ſhould
attend to. This being granted, it remains
to prove by what means the greateſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
is to be produced.</p>
               <p>The advocates for ſmall farms will ſay,
By the induſtry which is ſo conſpicuous
among ſmall farmers, who, being obliged
to ſtruggle for their livelihood, can neither
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0398000400:9"/>
commit waſte, nor be guilty of neglect. I
ſay, that it is by the induſtry of thoſe who,
being eaſy in their circumſtances, can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
their buſineſs with ſpirit and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
and who, by daily taſting the
ſweets of their labours, are encouraged to
redouble their activity. But let us conſult
facts, and ſee which argument they will
beſt ſupport.</p>
               <p>It has pretty generally been laid down
as a maxim, by the gentlemen I allude to,
that farms of one hundred acres are the
proper ſize<note n="*" place="bottom">Viz. Author of Political Speculations, and others.</note>. This they ſay without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying
the kind of ſoil; a circumſtance,
ſurely, ſomewhat material to be known.
However, I will aſſiſt them in that point,
which I am enabled to do, by finding
others, or perhaps the ſame under another
ſignature, talk of 50 <hi>l.</hi> a year.—We will
therefore ſuppoſe the land at 10 <hi>s.</hi> an acre;
and as we muſt take the average price of
England, I will call it good loam; and to
aſſiſt their argument, I will tell them what
are the neceſſary requiſites for ſuch a farm.
Firſt, it is abſolutely neceſſary that the
farmer ſhould have in ready caſh at leaſt
500 <hi>l.</hi>—When I mention this ſum, I am
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0398000400:10"/>
far within bounds: had he more, he and
his country would reap the benefit of it.
I ſhall not enter into the minute detail of
every inſtrument to be purchaſed, and every
operation neceſſary to be done, but only
chalk out the great outlines of the oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
neceſſary on ſuch a farm.</p>
               <p>He muſt keep at leaſt 4 horſes; 5 would
be better, but almoſt too much for his capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
He muſt keep
<list>
                     <item>1 Ploughman,</item>
                     <item>1 Boy,</item>
                     <item>1 Threſher,</item>
                     <item>1 Maid,</item>
                     <item>1 Odd man.</item>
                  </list>
Now, without entering into the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his farm, or conſidering whether
he is a good or a bad farmer; I mean to
prove, from the above circumſtances, that
three hundred acres of ſuch land in the
hands of one man, will produce more,
and conſequently that ſuch a ſized farm,
conſidered in a national view, is more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial.
I ſhall not be thought unreaſonable
in alloting my farmer on the three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
acres, a proportionate ſum of money,
cattle, and ſervants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0398000400:11"/>
Thus he will have 1500 <hi>l.</hi> in money,
<list>
                     <item>12 Horſes,</item>
                     <item>9 Men,</item>
                     <item>3 Boys,</item>
                     <item>3 Maids, or the labour of three women.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Previous to what I am now going to ſay,
I muſt mention ſome facts which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
by way of explanation to ſome of my
readers, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are operations on
this, and indeed almoſt every kind of ſoil,
which, at different times, require different
ſtrength of horſes: for example, ſometimes
ſix horſes will be required in one plough,
to break up a piece of ground for fallow;
thus, in this inſtance, the farmer of three
hundred acres will have two ploughs at
work, when the little farmer cannot have
one, but muſt wait till it is perhaps too
late to recover his ſeaſon; or at leaſt he
will have loſt all the benefit of the roaſting
weather, which is to make his fallow. On
the other hand, there are many operations
in fallowing, and in feed-time, when three-horſe
ploughs are ſufficient; in which caſe
the farm of three hundred acres will have
four three-horſe ploughs at work when the
other can have but one. To this ſome will
ſay, why not in the one inſtance hire, and
in the other work with two-horſe ploughs,
in which caſe they would be equal, as in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0398000400:12"/>
part of Yorkſhire, Norfolk, Eſſex, &amp;c.
I anſwer, that at the one time, perhaps,
his neighbours are equally buſy with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and as to the latter, I will agree
there are times when two-horſe ploughs
are uſeful: but if horſes go abreaſt when
there is any moiſture in this ſort of land,
the damage done by their trampling the
ſurface of the ground, will not be recovered
in a twelvemonth. If what I have ſaid
be truth, it is as evident, that the farmer
of three hundred acres, with a proportionate
capital and number of horſes, is able to do
more than his proportion of work in the
ſame time; and the doing of it at the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
juncture, is of ſo much the greater
conſequence; thus his ground is naturally
in better tilth, his fallows, ſeed-time, dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart,
in ſhort, every operation performed
better, becauſe they can be diſpatched;
and his ground being in better order, it will
not be denied but that his produce muſt be
greater. There is alſo an advantage in the
proportion of ſervants, which will not ſo
eaſily be underſtood but by practical men;
for it is natural to ſay, As one is to four, ſo
are three to twelve: but this will not hold
good in practice; for, in harveſt-time, and
many other operations which require that
kind of diſpatch, by throwing many hands
together, the work is better and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditiouſly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0398000400:13"/>
done: for example, in harveſt;
two drivers, two loaders, two pitchers, two
rakers, and the reſt at the rick, or in the
barn, will diſpatch double the work that
the ſame number of hands would do, if divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into different gangs on different farms.
Howſoever unintelligible this matter may
appear to ſome, it is fact. But the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the great farmer's employing an
equal number of men may be denied; in
anſwer to which I can only ſay, that daily
obſervation proves it, and ſhall add more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
that reapers will flock to him, when
the little farmer is not able to get a hand:
the reaſon is evident, namely, that labourers
will always prefer that maſter who is moſt
likely to employ them longeſt, that they
may not loſe time in ſhifting. But as I
mean to confute by facts, and not by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
I will appeal to the farmer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what I advance is true or not.</p>
               <p>The great farmer will alſo have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
advantage in reſpect to his carts
and waggons; for he will not require above
two waggons and four carts, whereas each
of the little ones is obliged to have one
waggon and two carts; thus there will be
a ſaving of the expence of one waggon
and two carts on an equal ſpot of ground;
which ſurplus may be expended in ſtock
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0398000400:14"/>
or labour: the ſame will hold good with
regard to harrows, rollers, and many other
implements.</p>
               <p>There is likewiſe a national advantage
attending this farm, which cannot be on
the ſmall one; I mean, the keeping of
live ſtock; oxen, or ſheep, or both. It
may be aſked, Why? and whether an
equal number of cattle may not be kept
on the three ſmall farms? The reaſons
why they cannot are many: The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing
of ſtock, and providing artificial
food for them, not only requires capital,
but the reſolution of a man in an extenſive
buſineſs: for though 500<hi>l.</hi> are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
for one hundred acres, yet ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
a part laid by for ſuch purpoſes,
I will ſay 50<hi>l.</hi> out of each 500<hi>l.</hi> my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is, that 150<hi>l.</hi> in the hands of one
man, will encourage him to do more than
50<hi>l.</hi> in thoſe of the other. For the truth
of this I will appeal to the feelings of
farmers, or indeed of men on the Royal
Exchange. However, there is a yet more
ſubſtantial reaſon; which is, that the little
farmer cannot do it with ſo much profit;
for ſuppoſe he ſhould have a flock of one
hundred ſheep, which is a great many for
ſuch a farm, that flock will not maintain
a ſhepherd, though it requires as much
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0398000400:15"/>
care and attendance as triple the number,
which would be very eaſily tended by one
man; nor is it ſufficient to make a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
fold: even if there is a common, the
ſmall farmer will not reap an equal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
with the larger; for his ſheep muſt
ſtraggle by themſelves, and the ſhepherd
who attends the large flock will always
take care to have the beſt feed, while the
others are drove among buſhes and furzes
to ſeek a miſerable livelihood; loſing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
half their wool before ſheering time;
and thus they become of leſs benefit, either
to the owners or to the nation. With
oxen, it is nearly the ſame: there muſt
be artificial food provided for them, which
is rarely ſeen on ſmall farms; nor indeed
will the little farmer eaſily be induced to
go into ſuch a culture: his capital is too
ſmall, and he truſts to his corn to pay his
rent, though the benefit of the dung of
theſe cattle would be very conſiderable.
This is one of the great advantages which
attends the farmer who at the ſame time is
the grazier; and who is of ſo much more
value to his country, as he can, by the
aſſiſtance of artificial paſture, bring cattle
to market at a cheaper rate than when fed
on old paſtures and hay; with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
benefit to the nation, of employing
more hands in procuring that food for the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0398000400:16"/>
cattle, though they can be brought to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
cheaper, and will be of courſe when
the practice becomes more general.</p>
               <p>In oppoſition to theſe arguments, I hear
ſome ſay, that corn can be raiſed cheapeſt by
the ſmall farmer, becauſe the chief of the
labour is executed by himſelf and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
whereas the labour on the great farm
is done by others, whoſe wages muſt be
paid out of the profits. Thoſe who argue
thus are little acquainted with huſbandry
affairs; for it will appear upon inquiry,
that there neither is or can be one ſervant
leſs kept on the three ſmall farms, than
there are on the three hundred acres in the
hands of one man. However induſtrious
the ſmall farmer may be, it does not exempt
him from keeping one ſingle ſervant the
leſs; he muſt have, as I ſaid before,
<list>
                     <item>1 Ploughman,</item>
                     <item>1 Boy,</item>
                     <item>1 Threſher,</item>
                     <item>1 Odd-man,</item>
                     <item>1 Maid.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>If his ſons and daughters are grown up,
and able to do the buſineſs of the farm,
they ſeldom remain at home; and if they
do, they are not maintained for ſo little as
hired ſervants: but we will ſuppoſe that
matter equal. I only mean to prove, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0398000400:17"/>
the farmer cannot rely on his own labour;
and if he does, I will maintain that he
is a loſer by it. His employment ſhould
be, a general attention to the whole: his
threſher muſt be watched, or he will ſoon
loſe his wages in corn not threſhed out;
his mowers, reapers, &amp;c. muſt be looked
after; he muſt conſtantly go round his
ſences; he muſt ſee there is no neglect;
which would be the caſe if he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to any one ſpot: if he chances to
have a few ſheep, they will require as
much attendance as a larger flock; yet he
cannot afford to keep a ſhepherd: thus
there are three men employed to look after
three hundred acres, which would be at
leaſt as well managed by one man on his
horſe. To this it will be ſaid, No; the
great farmer growing opulent, becomes
negligent, and of courſe, his ground is
not ſo well managed, and his produce is
conſequently leſs. This is a contradiction
in terms; for if he grows opulent, in
what manner did he acquire his riches,
but by having a greater return for his
capital, and thereby being able to lay up
ſomething annually, which the ſmall far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſeldom or ever has it in his power to do,
unleſs indeed by a very uncommonly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
huſbandry. There cannot be a clearer
proof that a certain tract in the hands of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0398000400:18"/>
one man produces more than in the hands
of many: for was it otherwiſe, and that
he was carrying on a loſing trade, it is a
known fact, that the greater his undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the ſooner he would be ruined: but
on the other hand, if there is ever ſo ſmall
an annual ſaving, that will ſoon accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;
and I will venture to ſay, that the
man who finds he is carrying on a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
buſineſs, will attend it with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more ſpirit, than the poor dejected
wretch, who is always labouring againſt
the ſtream.</p>
               <p>But this calculation of the comparative
advantage of labour on the great and ſmall
farms, only regards the common buſineſs
of a farmer, without taking in the ſeveral
great works of marling, land-draining, &amp;c.
by which ſuch conſiderable improvements
have been made, but which there is rarely,
if ever, an inſtance of on ſmall farms, for
want of a ſufficient capital for ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking;
and when I mention this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
let it be remembered that I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it as a national one, as I cannot admit
a diſtinction between the profit of the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and that of the nation, each depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo intimately on the other.</p>

               <head>SECTION II. That the large farmers retaining their corn;
under the preſent laws, is beneficial to the
nation.</head>
               <p>THE general outcry which has been
made againſt the great farmer, for
keeping his corn from market, has not failed
to inflame the minds of almoſt all ranks of
people. The arguments made uſe of have
been plauſible, and could not but have
weight with thoſe among us who are neither
acquainted with huſbandry, the nature of
markets, nor the corn laws. It is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of men compaſſionating the miſerable
ſtate of the diſtreſſed Poor, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
one of thoſe popular topics which
muſt affect the religious good man. But
when we come coolly to examine the ſtate
of our huſbandry, markets, and corn laws,
and who are the preſent purchaſers of corn,
we ſhall perhaps find, that it is a moſt
happy circumſtance for this nation, that
there are a ſett of wealthy farmers who
have it in their power to retain a part of
their growth in thoſe natural and beſt of
granaries, their ricks. Was it otherwiſe, as
the corn laws now ſtand, we might often,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0398000400:20"/>
even with a moſt plentiful harveſt, be in the
utmoſt danger of famine.</p>
               <p>The argument made uſe of is, that the
little farmer is, through neceſſity, obliged
to threſh out his corn and bring it to market;
but that the opulent man will not produce
his, until it comes to a certain price. The
firſt fact I will allow; for true it is, that the
little farmer is obliged to bring his corn to
market before Chriſtmas, to enable him to
pay his rent; and therefore it is at that
time that corn is cheapeſt: but what is the
conſequence? Their little portion is ſoon
gone, and you have no reliance but on the
ricks of the great farmer to afford you a
regular ſupply. Had their corn likewiſe
been threſhed out and brought to market,
what would have been the conſequence? the
Poor could not have conſumed it; but it
would have been cheap, and ſo cheap, that
Bear-Key, which is eſteemed the barometer
of our produce, would have pronounced
corn plenty this year, at a time, when, I
am confident, England had the greateſt
reaſon to dread a ſcarcity; and, in this caſe,
your corn might have been exported, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
with a bounty, without a poſſibility of
receiving a ſingle grain back again. What
would then have become of your Poor at
Midſummer? This is a real fact, and lucky
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0398000400:21"/>
it is for us at preſent, that either the great
farmers wilfully retain, or by ſome other
circumſtances have it not in their power to
ſend corn to market in ſuch quantities as
would gratify the ſpleen of ignorant, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
people: for my own part, I am
apt to ſuſpect that ſome have not in their
power to do it: for I will confeſs that there
is in ſome inſtances an evil attending great
farms, which is, where landlords, when
they lay many ſmall farms together, deſtroy
barns to avoid the expence of repairs. Thus
the want of threſhing-floors, added to the
bad yield of the crop, may, in ſome places,
prevent the great farmer's ſending to market
what he would otherwiſe do. Some there
may be, who greedy of gain, may wait a
higher market; but they as often outſtand
it. Wheat is now near 15<hi>l.</hi> per load: do not
imagine that farmers in general are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with ſuch a price. The fair trader in
London would be ſatisfied with ſuch a profit:
yet there are ſcheming ſpeculators who ruin
themſelves and their neighbours. So it is
with farmers. They are men like your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and let them ſtand on the ſame
ground, for their occupation is full as
honourable, and infinitely more beneficial
to a nation. In plentiful years they muſt
ſell cheap: let them then, when they have
ſcanty crops, have a price equal to the loſs
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0398000400:22"/>
in their quantity; treat them as you would
be done by, and ceaſe ſuch illiberal abuſes
againſt men who deſerve every encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and who ſhould be conſidered by a
wiſe nation as it's bulwark and the ſource
of it's riches. Let theſe declaimers point
me out a number of merchants, who, at
the approach of a war, when a heavy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of taxes is to be laid on the Poor,
would not monopolize hemp, though the
enhancing its price to government muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
add to the weight already laid on
the Poor? How few are there who will not
engroſs a commodity neceſſary for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturer,
and thereby render the national
advantage of exporting his labours abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
by raiſing the price ſo that we cannot
fell upon an equal footing with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours?
How very few are there, who, in
the greateſt dearth at home, will not export
our beef and corn, if they can do it to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage?
But if the farmer retains his corn
but a day, applications are made to parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to force it if poſſible out of his barn.
Let theſe declaimers, among whom there
are many who, to get money, will think
no ſcheme too wild, turn their hands to the
plough, and ſee what plenty they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to their families. They will, I ſuſpect,
though too late, diſcover that more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
is requiſite in that, than in fabricating
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0398000400:23"/>
a bill upon the Royal-Exchange, and that
cloſe attention and hard labour are the price
of the comforts which the farmer enjoys.</p>

               <head>SECTION III. Of the different ſupply of markets from large
or ſmall farms, in regard to pigs, poultry,
butter, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>ANOTHER national evil which has
been pointed out as proceeding from
the preſent cuſtom of monopolizing land,
is the want of that ſupply of pigs, poultry,
butter, and eggs, with which markets were
ſo well ſtocked by little farmers, and which
greatly tended to lower the price of other
proviſions. In anſwer to the two firſt of
theſe articles, I ſhall briefly obſerve, that
they are not objects worthy the attention of
the legiſlature; for few will conceive that
dainties ſhould be brought to market to
reduce the average price of proviſions: but
was it otherwiſe, I will ſay, that no ſmall
farmer can raiſe pigs and fowls in the ſame
diſtrict at ſo low a price as butcher's meat,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0398000400:24"/>
no more than he can afford to ſell veal and
lamb at the ſame price as beef and mutton;
and therefore, eſpecially, when proviſions
are dear, it is better that ſuch delicacies be
kept from market, and that what they coſt
in cramming, be expended in rearing up
live ſtock.</p>
               <p>But as ſome may differ with me in
opinion, I ſhall inform ſuch, that it is not
the little farmer who can rear either to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
If he is a ſuckler, not one drop
of milk can be ſpared to the ſow which is
to fatten her pigs, and if he has only one
cow for the uſe of his family, the milk will
be more advantageouſly conſumed among
them than in his ſtye: farther, unleſs he
has conſtant threſhing going on, that the
pigs and poultry may always have to pick
up the corn which is left in the ſtraw thrown
out at the barn door, he will find that they
will want the many handfuls of corn thrown
to them, which are never taken account of,
and not miſſed, becauſe they are taken from
the great heap, but which, if meaſured out
to the good houſewife, whoſe perquiſite
they are, would ſtartle her at the end of
the year. So thoroughly is a neighbour of
mine ſatisfied of the truth of this, that he
is determined never to rear another pig;
convinced that he can buy ſtore pigs to put
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0398000400:25"/>
up for fattening, cheaper than he can rear
them; being well aſſured that they do not
coſt him leſs than 8<hi>d.</hi> per pound before they
are put up: much leſs will he be able to
ſell a ſucking pig at the price of butcher's
meat. Thoſe who are acquainted with the
fattening of ſuckling animals, know the
truth of what I ſay.</p>
               <p>It is only the cottager and large farmer
who can rear them to advantage; the firſt,
by letting a ſow with her litter of pigs run
in the lanes, or rather, under that pretence,
in the fields and meadows of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
farmers. Yet this cannot be deemed
a national benefit. The only perſon who
can rear pigs to real advantage, is the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
who ſows fields of clover purpoſely for
their uſe, (but this muſt be at a diſtance
from large towns, where hay does not fetch
an extraordinary price) or the dairy-man
who makes butter and cheeſe. Theſe are
likewiſe the only people who can ſupply us
with butter at a reaſonable rate, and that by
dint of capital and cloſe attention to that
one article: nor are theſe men ſeated on
what are called arable farms.</p>
               <p>Here I will inform my opponents of a
practice they are probably not acquainted
with, which is, that in Denbighſhire and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0398000400:26"/>
Flintſhire, it is no uncommon thing to ſee
hundreds of pigs, for which they grow
clover on purpoſe, and which graze on the
graſs lands adjoining the beach, and when
the tide is out, they go down and feed on
the ſea ooze, where they find ſhell-fiſh, &amp;c.
Theſe pigs are as regularly folded at night
as ſheep. They are bought up by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillers,
&amp;c. By this means pigs, or what
is more proper for the farm, pork, is reared
to moſt advantage. The perſon from whom
I had this information, and who has been
long a dealer in hogs, aſſures me of this fact;
and that it is not uncommon to ſee five
thouſand in one market; and he confirmed
to me what I have advanced, that it is the
great farmer only who can rear them to
advantage, and that by this practice.</p>
               <p>As to eggs, they may indeed, at particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
times of the year, have been brought to
market by the ſmall farmer: the ſame may
alſo be done by the cottager's wife, not
that it is ſuch a ſupply as will anſwer the
purpoſe. It is the quantity which comes
from Scotland, and other cheap countries,
that can affect the market.</p>
               <p>With regard to fowls, it is a known fact
that it is the great farmers who chiefly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0398000400:27"/>
ſupply markets with them; for they only
can do it to advantage.</p>
               <p>One Shallcroft, who had a farm of 400
acres, and who lately died worth 10,000<hi>l.</hi>
ſupplied Croydon market with fowls; and
what is remarkable is, that it is chiefly the
great farmers who have ſupplied that
market with poultry and butter for many
years paſt, and their wives have attended
that market as regularly as the farmers did
the corn market. That of butter cannot
be doubted; and the other is as evident to
thoſe who are the leaſt converſant in the
matter. The threſhing-floor of the great
farmer is always open, and it is the corn
thrown out in the ſtraw that fattens the
barn-door fowl; whereas the little farmer,
whoſe threſhing-floor is not conſtantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
muſt at times feed them, and the
wife, whoſe perquiſite they are, will not let
them ſtarve while there is a grain of corn
in the heap. If this is the caſe at Croydon,
which is ſo near London, and from whence
ſo much ſtraw is carried to ſupport the
London market with all this grain in it,
which would be picked out of the ſtraw by
pigs and fowls; how ſtrong a proof is it,
that the markets, at a diſtance from great
towns, muſt be more eaſily ſupplied with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0398000400:28"/>
fowls in the neighbourhood of large farms,
than where they are all ſmall ones?</p>
               <p>I am almoſt aſhamed to have given a
place to theſe anſwers; but the loſs of pigs,
poultry, butter, and eggs, has been ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
a topic in all companies, and in every
pamphlet which has appeared, that, inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
as the ſubject is, I could not avoid
expoſing the fallacy of the arguments
made uſe of on this occaſion.</p>
               <p>Let me now, in my turn, aſk, Who is
it that ſupplies our markets with beef and
mutton? It is the great and opulent
farmer. Who is it that furniſhes the Poor
with cheeſe, and ſuch butter as they ought
to eat, good potted Cambridge butter? It
is the great dairy men.—But among the
various lamentable complaints with which
we have been peſtered, I have not heard a
ſyllable of the want of veal or lamb; No!
there is plenty of them. Let theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimers,
if they really feel, as they pretend
to do, for the Poor, bluſh at the ſight of
it on their table. This is one of the real
cauſes of the high price of meat. When a
calf or a lamb can be made to fetch as
much at three months old, as they would
be worth when a ſteer or wether at two
years old in the ordinary method of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0398000400:29"/>
ſtock, this may ſometimes become a
real evil; but not the want of other lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uries
of the ſame kind.</p>

abſurdity of the aſſertion has often amazed

is, that the ſame writer who tells us there

intended to give my opinion on
this very intereſting ſubject, and am now
the more particularly induced ſo to do, as
I mean to avail myſelf of the very argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

Now it is reaſonable to allow the ſame

not, I know that there is the ſame number
of hands employed, though perhaps more

               <p>Thus there will be</p>

               <p>But the oeconomy of this farmer's family

I ſhall take no notice of them,
ſuppoſing them to be better employed

in ſcrubbing and dreſſing victuals for
the ſingle men on the ſmall farms. I
will therefore throw them into the
number of cottagers wives, ſuppoſing
ſome of theſe to be dead: but ſurely I
have a right to claim ſeven men for
the ſeven ſupernumerary farmers; and
their work ought to be reckoned as
ſomething; conſequently their labour
allowed on the large tract in the occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of one man; or elſe they muſt
be conſidered as uſeleſs bailiffs, and
conſequently as an incumbrance on the

much ſtreſs upon the labour of the ſmall
farmer, we will admit them on this
farm; and, ſuppoſing them likewiſe
married, and with children, they will
amount to 35</p>

               </p>
               <p>I have taken this mode of calculating the
inhabitants from the Author's own plan:
but allowing the ſeven ſupernumerary mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
men to be ſingle, and deducting for
their wives and children 28, there would
remain 114, among whom there would be
20 married men inſtead of only 16 on the
8 ſmall farms. Had this Author ſtated the
fact otherwiſe, and made the compariſon on
paſture land, I ſhould have agreed with
him: but on arable land, nothing is more
contrary to the fact than what he lays down.
Now we have each of us told our tale, and
the fact only muſt determine who is right.
At all events, I would adviſe gentlemen to
make very ſtrict inquiry into the truth of
the matter before they ſuffer themſelves to
be led away by every publication that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.
I will acknowledge, that there is a
management of land which may tend to
diminiſh the number of people in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
pariſh where it is practiſed; it is
indeed what rarely happens in old farms,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0398000400:36"/>
but it may be an attendant on ſome of the
new-incloſed common-field land, where,
perhaps at the inſtigation of the landlord,
too great a proportion is laid down to graſs.
A ſenſible tenant will be glad to meet with
old meadow; but few, I believe, will court
new paſtures, ſince the introduction of
clovers, &amp;c. I will likewiſe ſay, that there
are circumſtances when it may be prudent
for both tenant and landlord. For example;
ſuppoſe common-field land on a moory ſoil,
beſt adapted to paſture land, and which
with good management will, in a very few
years, become equal to the beſt: or ſuppoſe
chalky land, excellently well adapted to
ſainfoin, but by the barbarous cuſtom of
common-field tenure, rendered almoſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to the tenant. Are thoſe tenants who
ſenſibly pay higher rent for ſuch land when
incloſed, to be precluded the liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
it to what it ought to be, merely to
gratify the whim of a few theoretical
farmers; or ſhould the nation be deprived
of the increaſed produce, by its not being
put under proper culture? and yet, if this
is done to a great extent, it muſt diminiſh
the labour, and conſequently drive away
ſome of the inhabitants. But where do
theſe gentlemen-writers think they are gone
to? Perhaps to other ſpots, which once
were poor ſtinted commons, but now are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0398000400:37"/>
covered with ſheaves of corn, inſtead of the
few ſtarved ſheep which were maintained
there in the ſummer, for the winter food of
crows and ravens. It is indeed certain,
that large tracts of paſture land muſt keep a
diſtrict thin of inhabitants: it could not well
be otherwiſe, when, as formerly, graſs and
hay were the only method of fattening
bullocks: nor was that a branch which uſed
to be carried on by the little or middling
farmer: it was done by people of capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
and to turn it to the moſt advantage,
or indeed to employ their capital, large
tracts of land were neceſſary. It is, and
muſt continue to be, the ſame in breeding
countries; and on the downs, where our
flocks are bred, large tracts are requiſite for
a ſheep-walk. Beſt maiden down will not
carry above two ſheep per acre to fold,
without clover or good meadow to bait
them on: but let it not be imagined that
this is waſte; theſe little animals doubly
earn their value before they come to market,
by their fleeces, and by the many adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acres which they manure; and on this
account it is, that in theſe and ſuch-like
ſpots, large farms are indiſpenſably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary:
and the advantage of a large fold is
ſo well known, that in parts of Wiltſhire
where there are ſmall farms which have but
ſmall flocks, it is a common practice to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0398000400:38"/>
throw them into one fold, each man having
them for as many nights as are equal to the
proportion of his flock: nor indeed do I
know any tract of country where exceſſive
large farms, ſuch as have been alluded to,
prevail, but in downy countries, where
ſheep-walk is ſo neceſſary, and where often
many acres are rented for a few ſhillings,
Norfolk and Effex farms excepted: but in
Norfolk I hope our author will not ſay the
country has been depopulated by large
farms, for by the ſenſible and ſpirited cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the inhabitants of that country,
nobly inſpired by Lord Townſhend, who
quitted the office of Secretary of State to
become the uſeful huſbandman, they have
converted a barren ſand into the moſt fertile
ſpot in England. View their fields of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips,
barley, clover, wheat, and ſhew me
ſuch management in a country inhabited by
little farmers. But how have they done it?
by induſtry, and a ſenſible attention to their
buſineſs; by the landlords ſenſibly dividing
the country among opulent men, who, by
dint of capital, were able to cover their ſoil
with clay or marle at the expence of the
then fee-ſimple of the land, and not by
becoming indolent, becauſe they grew opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent:
and I will ſay, that it redounds much to
the honour of thoſe landed proprietors, that
they ſuffered the ſons to enjoy the fruits of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0398000400:39"/>
the labours of their fathers: not but that
their rents are now properly increaſed.</p>
               <p>This leads me neceſſarily to hint at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
obſervation of the author I allude to,
who ſeems to lay ſo great a ſtreſs on the
national advantage of increaſed rents, and
of the old method of calculating the profits
of the farmer by the three rents. In the
infancy of agriculture, it was a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and equal partition of property; ſuch
as is now practiſed in the leſs enlightened
parts of the world; in moſt parts of France,
Germany, and in ſome of our American
colonies: the one finds land and capital,
the other knowledge and labour: but on a
well-cultivated and good ſoil, the rent is
now the leaſt object: it is the ſum which a
man can ſink in ſtock, and in the annual
expence of his labour, on which he is to
reckon the intereſt of his money, or income.
—The ſubject has already led me beyond
the intended limits of this Chapter: but in
anſwering the author of the above-quoted
Pamphlet, on the topic of depopulation, I
was naturally led to point out ſome other
circumſtances in large farms, in which he
ſeemed to be equally miſinformed.</p>
               <p>Let it not, however, be thought that I
am ſo abſurd as to propoſe that all England
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0398000400:40"/>
ſhould be divided into large, or indeed any
particular-ſized farms. I have only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to refute the abſurd doctrine of thoſe
who maintain that large farms have brought
on a ruin to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ion and that the only
remedy is to divide the land into ſmall
farms. I ſay that there ſhould be, as there
are now, farms of all ſizes, to ſuit the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
capitals of the people who engage in
farming. If ſuch writers as I am ſpeaking
of were at all converſant in huſbandry, they
would know, as I have already explained,
that the proportion of land, which is in
ſome degree governed by its value, ſhould
be equal to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> capital; and if they
were acquainted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ words">
                     <desc>〈◊…〉</desc>
                  </gap> nature of the moſt
valuable trade of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ion, they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
agriculture in this country to be the
firſt object of commerce, and therefore they
would ſee that it is as abſurd to confine a
farmer with 10,000<hi>l.</hi> to one hundred acres,
as to place a man with 500<hi>l.</hi> on one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
acres. To ſay that a man, who, by
induſtry, has increaſed his capital in farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſhall ceaſe to be a farmer, is as great a
contradiction to common ſenſe; for ſuch
prohibition it would be, not to permit a
man to employ his capital in the buſineſs he
has been brought up to and underſtands.
Whatever may be the opinion of theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
I will maintain, that the produce
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0398000400:41"/>
of the earth is the only wealth of a
nation: if corn is our natural produce,
corn ſhould be our trade, as gold is that of
Peru; and perhaps it is the only trade that
cannot be over-done: we do not want in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
to prove, that artificial trade is often
extended to the ruin of a nation: that
cannot be the caſe with the produce of the
earth: manufactures have a limited con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption;
beſides which, that nation which
will not wear your cloth, will eat your
corn. Let this manufacture then go on in its
uſual courſe: it is in the hands of men who
underſtand it better than you do, and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, their own intereſt will tell them
what is moſt proper to be done.</p>

their compaſſion to the Poor only, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
their pity even to the farmer. Their
complaints are poured out againſt jobbers,
foreſtallers, and regrators; though I am
confident that many of them do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0398000400:42"/>
the particular occupation of either of
theſe, but confound the whole in one maſs.
I confeſs that there are many inſtances in
the ſale of cattle at Smithfield, which muſt
confirm theſe people in their opinion: a
very recent and remarkable one happened
on the 16th of November laſt, when oxen ſold
at 2 <hi>d.</hi> per pound; and yet there was no
viſible alteration in the price of butcher's
meat. This would naturally induce them
to believe that there is plenty, but that it is
withheld by art. It muſt, likewiſe, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that ſheep were dearer that very
day, than had been known for ſome time
paſt. However, as tales are told imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
and too often that part of them only
which makes for an argument, I am not
ſurprized that well-diſpoſed men are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
miſled. I ſhall not ſay but that
there may be, and is, craft in that buſineſs, as
there muſt be in every other where the leaſt
reſtriction will always give the attentive
artful man an advantage over his neighbour:
at the ſame time, it muſt be conceived, that
there is in this, as in all other articles, a
fluctuation in the price: nor will it be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to explain that this fluctuation muſt
operate by greater ſtrides in live cattle, than
in any commodity which can be depoſited
in magazines. All that the wiſdom of
legiſlature can do, or ought to attempt, is,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0398000400:43"/>
to let thoſe ſtreams of plenty flow from
their ſource in their natural channel; for
the dam that occaſions ſtill-water above, is
ſure to create a torrent below, which carries
every thing before it.</p>
            <p>To inveſtigate the truth of what is here
advanced, I ſhall explain the natural cauſes
of this fluctuation in the price of live cattle:
this will account for the ſudden fall of beef
on the day abovementioned, and prove that
it neither could have, nor ought to have,
any great effect on the price of butcher's
meat: I ſhall then proceed to point out the
channel in which the ſupply of live cattle
uſed to flow, till it met with a check,
which, I believe, has given ſome foundation
for a part of the complaints we have heard.
In doing this, I ſhall deſcribe the different
occupation of each man concerned in this
traffick; and from thence it will appear,
that the aboliſhing of either muſt eternally
produce the evil complained of.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, I ſhall inform the Reader,
that the fluctuation in the price of live ſtock
does, and ever muſt, depend on the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
there is of the different ſorts of food
neceſſary to ſupport thoſe cattle in their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
ſtages of age and degree of fatneſs.
For example; if after-paſture, fodder and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0398000400:44"/>
turnips fail, lean ſtock muſt be cheap, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there will not be purchaſers for them
at the fairs; and fat beaſts will, for the
ſame reaſon, keep their price, becauſe the
grazier knows it will turn to better account
for him to beſtow the food he has upon the
ſtock which is nearly fit for market, than
to divide it among many, which would
keep the forward ones too back; nor would
it bring the lean ſtock forward enough to
make off in the ſpring with any moderate
degree of profit. Thus he will conſume
the whole with his fattening beaſts, by
which means there will not be a ſucceſſion
to ſupply the market, and thoſe beaſts
which would have come in the ſpring, muſt
be kept lean, to another year. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
and the ſcarcity of food, which
will not allow him to have ſo great a ſtock
to employ his capital in, muſt naturally,
and ought to give him a greater profit on
the few he has. Thus will the courſe of
market generally be governed; and I believe
it was as generally expected that what I
have related would have been the caſe this
year; for there was in the ſummer little
appearance of graſs, fodder was evidently
ſcarce, and cabbages and turnips had failed
almoſt every where: but a moſt providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
fine autumn furniſhed the Eſſex and
Kentiſh men with ſuch abundance of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſture,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0398000400:45"/>
that they gave great prices for all
cattle that were forward enough to be
brought on. This naturally induced them
to make off all their ſtock on hand that was
fit, or nearly fit, for market, in order that
their new ſtock might have ſufficient plenty
to puſh them on before the winter ſet in,
when they could be able to finiſh them on
oil-cake, &amp;c. To this I impute the great
and unexpected glut that there was at
Smithfield on the Monday alluded to; and
what ſtrengthens me in my opinion is, that it
was immediately after Kingſton-Fair, where
a great number of Welch beaſts were bought
up by the Eſſex and Kentiſh farmers. The
preſent high price of hay and oil-cakes
might indeed have operated in ſome degree,
by inducing many graziers to ſend up ſuch
of their beaſts as were fit for market, rather
than keep them back for the regular ſupply:
but as it is not natural to ſuppoſe that this
laſt reaſon ſhould have operated with all on
the ſame day, I cannot but think my ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
right; and what confirms me in it
is, that ſheep were dearer that very day
than they had been for ſome time paſt.
This laſt circumſtance is one reaſon why this
extraordinary fall in beef ſhould not have
had an immediate effect on the price of
butcher's meat: for it is the average of the
profits which muſt govern the butcher in his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0398000400:46"/>
ſale. But ſuppoſing mutton had been equally
cheap, no butcher in London would have
purchaſed more than was neceſſary for the
demand of his uſual cuſtomers: he could
neither keep his beaſts nor his ſheep alive;
and if he ſlaughtered them, he ran the riſk of
having a great part remain to ſpoil on his
hands. Thus the overplus of what was
wanted for the uſual conſumption, would be
naturally bought up by thoſe who had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of keeping them on; and was it not
for ſuch men, from whence ſhould we now
expect a regular ſupply, till thoſe beaſts are
brought forward, which are not yet fit for
market? Let it not, however, be imagined
that all their dealings are attended with
ſuch profit; they have ſevere blows, as well
as men in other trades: it is the average
profit of the whole year on which they
count their gain; and however it may be
the faſhion to ſtigmatiſe theſe dealers with
odious appellations, it is on them alone that
we can depend for a regular ſupply. Yet,
whilſt I am thus ſpeaking in favour of theſe
dealers, I will confeſs that I believe there
are among them ſome who, as the laws
have lately been enforced, have given too
great foundation for the clamours of the
people; I mean, when the ſaleſman is the
dealer. I know that precautions have been
taken to guard againſt this inconvenience,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0398000400:47"/>
by prohibiting them from holding farms:
but it is eaſy to conceive that ſuch a law
may be evaded: and I know that it is; and
though it be a crime to act in violation of
the laws, yet that crime is greatly leſſened,
if the enactors of the laws lay temptations
in the way, to induce people to act in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
thereto: and this they have done,
by aboliſhing what were called Jobbers;
the evil conſequences of which I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to explain.</p>
            <p>When there were thoſe traders in cattle
called Jobbers, Smithfield market was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
and well ſupplied. They were
people who had no fixed reſidence, but tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
the country in ſearch of ſuch cattle
as were fit for market; and having no land
in their own poſſeſſion, as ſoon as they had
bought a lot of ſheep, or oxen, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
diſpatched them to Smithfield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market,
where they were conſequently
obliged to be ſold. If ſeveral of theſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to meet at the ſame market, which
was frequently the caſe, of courſe their
cattle were ſold cheap; but they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with their chance profit; and ſet out
immediately on another journey. If the
cattle were ever ſo cheap, the butchers could
not buy more than for their uſual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.
This neceſſarily called in a ſet
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0398000400:48"/>
of men who had land within a moderate
diſtance of the metropolis, and thereby had
an opportunity of keeping them on, to
ſupply the market regularly. Theſe men
naturally ſhould have their profit: but that
could not, in general, be great, as they
were always liable to have great quantities
poured in unexpectedly by the jobbers,
whoſe motions were never known, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
uncertain. Thus were the markets
always fully ſtocked; the grazier got rid of
his cattle, at his door, without trouble or
expence; and the butcher was always ſure
of finding a market well ſupplied by the
jobber, or the intermediate man who had
always by him a ſtock that had been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
when the markets were glutted.
This was a regular channel of trade, which
went on uninterrupted: whereas, when the
jobbers were ſuppreſſed, the grazier was
obliged either to ſend up his cattle himſelf,
or to commit them to the care of a ſaleſman,
who, of courſe, became his adviſer when
to ſend his ſtock to market; and by this
means, being intimately acquainted with
the demand and the ſupply, it is natural to
believe that ſelf-intereſt, which governs us
all, would induce him to become a purchaſer,
who had it ſo much in his power to ſupply
the butchers as he thought proper, and who,
by the ſame knowledge, had it as much in
his power to purchaſe his cattle at what
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0398000400:49"/>
price he pleaſed to ſet on them: for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
but the combination of a few, to
order up the grazier's cattle whenever they
wiſhed to make a purchaſe. In this manner
has the profit of the latter decreaſed ſo
much, as to render it neceſſary for ſome
of them to attend Smithfield themſelves,
though, when they came there, they could
only look on; not having it in their power
to ſell to a butcher, who was perhaps as
much in the clutches of the ſaleſman as
himſelf. By this means we have loſt that
intermediate man, ſo neceſſary to all parties,
and by this means we have created a real
foreſtaller. I will not charge all with being
guilty of this practice: there are honeſt
men, as well as knaves, in every profeſſion.
I have only endeavoured to point out the
manner in which this may operate; and I
am confident that it will, whenever there is
the ſmalleſt reſtriction or interference of
legiſlature in any trade; for, as Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Mildmay juſtly obſerves, a general
liberty granted to raiſe our neceſſary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
will procure us a general plenty for
ſale; a general indulgence allowed to this
ſale, will reduce them to a general cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
&amp;c. Happy am I to think we have a
Miniſter, whoſe wiſdom has induced him to
liſten to ſuch men as can give him real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
on a ſubject he cannot be ſuppoſed
to be intimately acquainted with himſelf!</p>

            <head>CHAPTER III. On Luxury, as affecting Proviſions and
Population.</head>
            <p>AMONG the many writers who have
favoured us with their productions on
the ſubject of Proviſions and Population,
there are none who fail to attribute it, in
part or the whole, to Luxury. I ſhall not
attempt to ſay that Luxury has not an
effect on the price of all commodities;
among others, on proviſions: but how far
it is prejudicial or beneficial to a ſtate, is
matter of ſerious conſideration, and ſhould
be handled with infinite delicacy whenever
the ſubject is taken up by the Legiſlature.
It is a known fact, that, in an infant-ſtate,
Luxury is a child which ſhould be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
to ſuch a degree as to procure the
conveniencies and comforts of life; for on
that depends the improvement of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
arts, manufactures, and commerce.
It is as certain a fact, that Luxury is an
attendant on wealth, and that, when it is
not accompanied with vice, it is a benefit
to a nation. By this it is that wealth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
more equally diffuſed among all
ranks of people: it encourages the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturer
and artificer; and if it is confined
to the table of the rich man, agriculture
reaps the benefit of it, without any public
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0398000400:51"/>
detriment: in ſhort, in every inſtance, the
poor receive their ſhare of this ſcattered
wealth; and in proportion to the luxury
of the ſpot, the poor who inhabit are, by
the diffuſed riches, enabled to bear their
ſhare in the price of proviſions. In proof
of what I ſay, draw the compariſon between
the labouring poor of the city of London
and its neighbourhood, with thoſe of Wales
and other remote countries. I do not ſpeak
of the worthleſs abandoned poor: they
always flock to large cities, and ſubſiſt by
charity and theft, where they are not ſo
eaſily detected as in the country. This
leads me to point out a ſpecies of luxury
which I have never heard arraigned, but
which, I am confident, does much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
though proceeding from a laudable
motive: I mean, that unbounded charity
which, when kept within limits, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
with prudence, is the noble cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic
of the Engliſh nation; but which
I have known, in many inſtances, to do
much hurt, and encourage idleneſs, inſtead
of rewarding induſtry. I ſay, this evil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from luxury, becauſe I fear an oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatious
vanity is frequently the motive for
many whimfical donations.</p>
            <p>Why Luxury ſhould be an attendant on
wealth is obvious; it is, becaufe money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
cheap: but in ſuch proportion all
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0398000400:52"/>
commodities riſe in value. In 1307, when
the intereſt of money was 45 <hi>per cent.</hi> all
proviſions were what we ſhould now call
cheap. In 1604, when the intereſt of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
was 9<hi>l.</hi> 16 <hi>s. per cent.</hi> proviſions roſe
in proportion; and ſo on to this day, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
proper allowance for the different cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
which attended this country
when divided by civil wars, or harraſſed by
foreign enemies. But as luxury is the
conſtant attendant on wealth, it muſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
affect proviſions in a greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for it will create waſte; it induces
people of fortune to keep a great number
of domeſtic ſervants, who are fed on dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
inſtead of the coarſe but wholeſome
food they were before accuſtomed to; it
increaſes the number of horſes which are
kept for pleaſure; both which muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
increaſe the conſumption of meat
and corn. It likewiſe certainly affects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
by the deſtruction of the number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
calves and lambs that are ſlaughtered
for the London market, which muſt raiſe
the price of beef and mutton, as they
conſume in three months the amount in
value of food which would rear them, to
two years old. This is, indeed, an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to agriculture, and, as I ſaid
before, diſperſes the wealth among all ranks
and denominations of people, while the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0398000400:53"/>
taxes on luxury properly fall upon the rich,
and the land is ſo far relieved of a part of
that burthen which muſt be chearfully
borne for the ſupport of a great and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
nation, I mean that part of the taxes
which, lights on the conſumer, which is all
exciſeable commodities. It will here be
ſaid, that the waſte on the rich man's table,
and the corn conſumed by his horſes, would
feed many hungry mouths. I allow it:—
but the evil points out a remedy; for if it
is the real fact, as I believe it to be, that
the conſumption is greater than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
cultivate more land, and ſuffer not
barren acres to ſtare us in the face when
we are crying out for bread.</p>
            <p>There is yet another ſpecies of Luxury,
which is in conſequence of wealth; it is, that
the inhabitants of the country naturally flock
to great cities, where they can enjoy the more
refined amuſements of a poliſhed nation.
The conveniency of trade indeed brings
thither the moſt conſiderable part; the
neceſſary calling together of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
brings another part; and the attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to courts and other amuſements,
brings the third. Theſe neceſſarily carry
with them a ſuite of attendants, which I
cannot but think miſchievous to a ſtate;
for the loitering life of a gentleman's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
not only debauches his own mind,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0398000400:54"/>
but, by his attendance on the great, and
his intercourſe with the inferior claſs,
makes him the vehicle of conveyance of
thoſe manners which ruin the induſtrious
tradeſman, though neceſſary accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the rich. If they unfortunately
ſee a bad example, they retail it out with
all its miſchievous conſequences; and in
this manner does their appearance and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
operate when they return with their
maſters to the country. They there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch
the minds of the ruſtic labourers,
who envy their fine cloaths and lazy life;
and by this means too many of the inferior
claſs are drawn to towns, where, I muſt
confeſs, they do not continue to be ſuch
uſeful members in point of population, as
if they had remained in the country; for
by all the calculations that have appeared,
the lives of children in towns bear no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
with thoſe born and bred up in the
country. This neceſſary evil, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
all great cities, is the natural and
inevitable conſequence of wealth. Let us
not, however, ſee things in ſo gloomy a
light, as to think theſe people entirely loſt
to ſociety, or even to that part which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on agriculture. What I am going
to relate is matter of fact within my own
knowledge; namely, that in hay and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
time, when labourers are wanted in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0398000400:55"/>
the country, it is inconceivable what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of tradeſmen and handicrafts flock into
the country, and as conſiderable is the
aſſiſtance we receive from them at the only
time they are wanted there. Thus they
become doubly beneficial to the nation.
The fact is as I ſay, but their motives may
be two-fold; the one, that they have not
employment at that time of the year; and
the other, that nature may dictate to them
the deſire of breathing the freſh air they
were accuſtomed to in their youth, when
they learnt the different branches of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
buſineſs, which they return to at a
time when their town employment falls
ſlack, and when, as I ſaid before, we only
want them.</p>
            <p>I am far from being an advocate for
wanton Luxury. There have been too
many inſtances in hiſtory, to prove that
Luxury, accompanied with vice, which is
its laſt ſtage, muſt ever end in ruin to a
ſtate. All that I mean to alledge is, that
Luxury will attend the wealth of a great
trading nation, and that what was once a
virtue, cannot be converted into a vice. Let
thoſe who exclaim againſt the evil effects
of Luxury, keep a watchful eye over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and they will not have cauſe to
complain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0398000400:56"/>
Let thoſe who reſide in the country ſet a
good example to the poor inhabitants of
the village; let thoſe who have it in their
power diminiſh, if poſſible, at leaſt not
increaſe, the number of alehouſes, which
are perdition to the poor, and the real
cauſe of their diſtreſs. I know many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
in different parts of the country
where labourers maintain themſelves and
families comfortably, even in theſe times,
on ſix ſhillings a week; whereas in other
places they are ſtarving on nine in winter,
and ten to twelve in ſummer. But where
the former reſide, there are no alehouſes,
and they themſelves attribute their comfort
to it: however, where they cannot be eaſily
aboliſhed, let the reſtrictive laws attending
licences be enforced; prevent gambling,
and do not ſuffer them to permit a labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inhabitant of the pariſh to ſit in their
houſes but at the ſtated hours of meal times;
this every one has it in his power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent;
and this I know to be one of the
chief cauſes of the diſtreſs of the poor, as
hath juſtly been remarked by the Reverend
Mr. Powel, of Fakenham, in his <hi>Real
Grievances,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

proviſions.</head>
            <p>THE real cauſe of the preſent ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
being, in general, too well
known to need any formal diſcourſe to
aſcertain its origin, it may, perhaps, be
thought impertinent in me to undertake
that taſk: and, indeed, I honeſtly confeſs,
that the original intention of theſe ſheets
was only to ſhew, that it is not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
ſolely to any of the various cauſes I
have lately ſeen aſſigned for it in print.
Moſt of thoſe publications have appeared
to me big with miſchief, as blowing the
trumpet of diſcontent among every rank
of people; and, howſoever inadvertently
they may have been ſuffered to creep into
the world, they cannot fail to breed, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
among the lower claſs, that rancour
and jealouſy which are the mother of riot
and confuſion, and which may, if thus
fomented, carry them to ſuch lengths as
may ſeriouſly increaſe the misfortunes we
complain of. My only motive for thus
offering to the public my opinion on this
head, proceeds from an ardent deſire to
rectify, if I can, the ſtrangely miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
notion of my countrymen, by prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0398000400:58"/>
to them, that it is not to any indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual,
or ſet of individuals, that we
ought to aſcribe this calamity; but that
it is the hand of God which has viſited
us, and that it is patience only, with a
proper exertion of thoſe means which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
hath put in our power, that can
afford us relief. But as I find the number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
complaints of the diſſatisfied have
reached the ear of the Legiſlature, and
that the Parliament ſeem earneſtly diſpoſed
to adopt ſuch meaſures as ſhall appear to
them moſt ſalutary; I think it the duty of
every one who has conſidered this matter
candidly, to lay his thoughts open to
Government.</p>
            <p>Previous to our entering upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
it will be neceſſary to examine into
the truth of what is daily aſſerted about
the price of proviſions, and to determine
whether they are, or are not, really dear;
and, if found to be dear, how far the price
exceeds the bounds of what is deemed an
equitable one for the farmer. The only
method by which this fact can be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
is to draw a compariſon between
them and other articles of conſumption; for
example, if the articles of cloaths, houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
furniture, luxuries of life, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
have kept a nearly proportionate
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0398000400:59"/>
advance for any given number of years,
we have the cleareſt proof that there is
ſome one general extraneous cauſe which
affects the whole; and if it appears that
the riſe in the price of all the various com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
bears a juſt proportion to the
intereſt of money, it is as ſelf-evident that
the general cauſe is the riches of the nation:
but to fix this with ſuch preciſion as would
carry with it univerſal conviction, would
require many <hi>data</hi> not eaſy to be obtained.
Thus, among other circumſtances, to make
a juſt compariſon, it will be neceſſary that
there ſhould have been an equal demand
for every article; for on that will depend
the value of each. Now as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that ſuch <hi>data</hi> as I would only
draw concluſions from are, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
not to be obtained, I may claim
the ſame privilege as others aſſume, of
grounding my facts on the general cry,
that all the neceſſaries of life are at an
enormous price, which, as I ſaid before,
muſt proceed from one general cauſe, and
that can only be the cheapneſs of money;
and therefore, that all commodities bearing
that proportion are cheap, at leaſt not dear.
However, as an extraordinary demand for,
or a ſcarcity of any article, muſt affect
that article in a peculiar manner, I will
acknowledge that there is an advance in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0398000400:60"/>
the price of proviſions, though not ſo great
as is generally believed, nor ſuch as ought
to alarm this nation; nor will I ſcruple to
pronounce, that this advance has been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by a real ſcarcity of corn, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from a failure of crops in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
and that, for theſe five years paſt, we
have had, at one or other time of the year,
the moſt unfavourable ſeaſons for corn that
have been known for a long while paſt.
To this muſt be imputed the natural cauſe
of the dearneſs of all commodities, and
among them, of proviſions.</p>
            <p>It is the vaſt influx of wealth, which,
though the great encourager of agriculture,
brings with it an apparent temporary evil.
This is the mother of luxury, which as
certainly creates waſte, and, by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
conſumption, undoubtedly affects
the markets; as was clearly proved to the
Houſe of Lords about nine years ago, in the
examination of a perſon who had gone
through all the various branches of the
butcher's buſineſs, and who attributed the
great riſe in meat, in a great meaſure, to
the luxury of the town, ſaying, that the
tradeſman who formerly was contented with
a ſhoulder of mutton, muſt now have his
fillet of veal, &amp;c. and by this luxury's
deſcending to the loweſt claſs, there were
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0398000400:61"/>
not thoſe cuſtomers for the offal-pieces,
which were conſequently in a manner
thrown away. This might be the opinion
of a ſingle man; but certain it is, that the
conſumption of veal and lamb has increaſed
to a prodigious degree; and, as I mentioned
before, the expence of the food neceſſary to
bring thoſe young animals to market being
as much in four months as would maintain
them as a breeding ſtock for two years,
that muſt undoubtedly have an effect upon
all other butcher's meat, and this will as
ſurely affect other proviſions, in a certain
proportion.</p>
            <p>There is yet another manner in which
luxury has operated: it has increaſed the
number of poſt-horſes within theſe twenty
years, as ten to one. The increaſe of
ſtage-coaches too has been very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
as has likewiſe the number of wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon-horſes:
theſe laſt, indeed, have been
in conſequence of internal trade: yet all
theſe are, directly or indirectly, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of luxury, which has eſtabliſhed ſo
many faſhionable places of reſort for people
of all ranks and denominations, and in
which liſt the city of London has furniſhed
no inconſiderable part; for money, which,
in a trading nation, puts all men on a level,
ſoon teaches the tradeſman and his family
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0398000400:62"/>
that they can aſſociate with people of rank
and faſhion: thus ſervants, mimicking their
maſters and miſtreſſes, as ſoon forget the
prudent oeconomy of the pantry and cellar,
and vye with my lord's butler and my
lady's woman in every wanton extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,
which, fatal as it proves in the end,
does not at firſt diſpleaſe the good ſober
citizen: but this is the natural channel in
which riches ever will and ought to flow.
It is by theſe means that the wealth acquired
by the trading individual becomes equally
diffuſed among all ranks of men: it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
even to the chimney-ſweeper's boy,
who, inſtead of the cruſt of bread which
uſed to be his fee, now receives a morſel of
meat: but at laſt, though too late, the
tradeſman diſcovers that he and his family
have purchaſed a reliſh for pleaſure and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance
with a diminution of his capital.
He feels with redoubled force every little
blow in trade, becauſe he dares not retrench,
from a miſconſtrued pride, and fear of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring
his credit: he ſtretches every ſinew
to extend that credit and increaſe his trade:
perhaps, at laſt, conſcious that his own will
not ſupport his extravagance, he flies to
that of his neighbour, who, at the ſame
moment, may be getting into his. Thus
has trade been over-done, and credit, ſo
eſſential for a commercial nation, totally
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0398000400:63"/>
ruined. Stock-jobbing, and every ſpecies
of gambling, have ſucceeded, and have now
brought on a general bankruptcy among
thoſe people who were once improperly
thought the chief ſupport of this country.</p>
            <p>But let not this picture deceive us. It
only proves what common ſenſe ought
to have taught before, which is, that trade
can be extended but to a certain degree,
and that the only one which can be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicial
to a nation is the export of the produce
of the earth. Such part of it as can be
manufactured is undoubtedly doubly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous:
it maintains a number of men
who are the ſtrength of a nation, whilſt fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
who buy the manufactured goods,
pay their wages, which, in fact, becomes
an advanced price upon our corn and meat.
But as the demand for goods may be
limited, do not let us confine ourſelves to
the growth of ſo much corn only as will
maintain them, let the ſurplus be exported,
and though not attended with ſo much
profit, it is always an addition to the other;
the returns for which, in merchandize or
ſpecie, are our riches. Merchants, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
as they are, are no more than the
carriers of thoſe commodities: take them in
any other view, they are men preying upon
one another: one individual is enriched,
while the other is ruined; and whether the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0398000400:64"/>
trade is among ourſelves, or with others, ſo
ſoon as it exceeds the bounds of our produce
and manufactures, it is gambling, and, as
in all other games of chance, at the end of
the year, the profits will only pay the cards.
But miſerable as the preſent ſcene appears,
it by no means proves that the country is
not rich; it only ſhews how money may be,
and how it is, diſperſed and divided among
all ranks, and I could prove, happily for this
nation, that much of it is ſunk in the bowels
of the earth, from which grateful treaſury
we are ſure to receive ample returns. The
new cultivated lands, and improvements in
agriculture, with the great inland navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
have ſwallowed up immenſe ſums
in the purchaſe of corn to feed the labourers.
Theſe are the real riches of a country. It
would be wrong to imagine, that becauſe
ſome few individuals have over-traded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and want money, therefore the nation
is poor; look at the riches that are amaſſed
among the farmers, and bleſs yourſelves
that it has got into the hands of men who
will turn it to a national benefit; while they
thrive, the intereſt of your funds will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
low, and land will keep its price:
theſe are the only touchſtones of the value
of money.</p>
            <p>But before I quit this ſubject, let me
hint that I do not draw the diſtinction
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0398000400:65"/>
between agriculture, manufactures and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;
I know them all to be ſo dependant
on each other, that the prevalence of either
is prejudicial to this nation: all I contend
for is, that the ſource of the whole is agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who attempt to point out the
diſtinct advantage ariſing from either agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture,
manufactures, or commerce, are
little acquainted with the true policy of this
nation; for if they recollect that the natural
produce of this country conſiſts in corn
for the uſe of man, and other ſtaple com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
for our manufactures, ſuch as
hides, wool, tin, lead, and iron, they will
conceive that the labourers of the earth and
the manufacturers are ſo mutually dependent
one on the other, that to obtain the greateſt
national advantage from their reciprocal
labours, would almoſt ſeem to demand that
a juſt proportionate number of each ſhould
be preſerved: I ſay, in point of the profit
to be made on the produce of the earth,
which is the natural riches of a country,
this would ſeem to be the caſe, with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
number in agriculture to provide
food for their own body, and the third
claſs, which conſiſts of the navy, army,
and idle people: but no advantage could
ariſe from ſuch a diſtribution without the
aſſiſtance of traders, whoſe buſineſs it is to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0398000400:66"/>
export our manufactured ſtaple commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or the ſurplus of ſuch as are not
required for the different manufactures in
their raw ſtate: in return for theſe, the
trader brings us back either ſpecie, or, by
way of barter, the luxuries of life, or raw
materials for ſome manufactures, which we
have not within ourſelves, but are neceſſary
for them. In this manner are theſe three
claſſes ſo intimately dependant on each
other, that neither can exiſt alone in this
country, I mean to a national advantage;
nor in this view is it eaſy to determine to
which ſhould be aſcribed the preference in
point of rank: for unleſs we grew our own
corn, our manufactures would not be ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to the country, nor without manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
would our corn be exported to ſo great
advantage; nor would either be nationally
advantageous in point of riches if they could
not be exported. This therefore calls in
the aſſiſtance of the merchant, whoſe trade
would not be beneficial to the nation unleſs
his exports conſiſted in the produce of the
earth; and in the proportion that ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
exceed the value of his imports, the
balance is in favour of this country.</p>
            <p>Let it however be obſerved, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
ariſing from this chain of traffic is
limited to a certain pitch, beyond which it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0398000400:67"/>
cannot extend: it muſt be governed by the
demand of foreign markets, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
regulated by the conſumption, but
too often ſubject to the caprice of courts;
therefore it is impoſſible to determine the
exact proportion of hands proper to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
to each different claſs. It muſt then
remain an eſtabliſhed maxim, that, as Sir
James Stuart has ſo ably ſhewn, each
claſs will, from time to time, be ſupplied
with the overflowings of the other, as exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
direct: but it ſhould be remembered,
that manufactories can at no time employ
more than are requiſite at that particular
time to ſupply the demands of trade;
whereas the culture of the earth cannot
be over-done. If the quantity of corn and
cattle produced ſhould, by being too great
for the conſumption, reduce the price below
what is a reaſonable profit for the farmer,
that cheapneſs will create mouths to eat it,
that is, men will flock in from different
countries to that ſpot where there is the
greateſt plenty. This will make us formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
in point of people, and the taxes on
what they conſume will increaſe the revenue,
ſo as to enable the Government to diſcharge
part of its debt, at leaſt enable it to protect
its territories, without loading the Poor with
a freſh burden. This argument would rather
ſeemingly lead to give the preference to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0398000400:68"/>
agriculture: but I ſhall contend for no more
than to call it the ſpring of the whole machine.</p>
            <p>In contradiction to what I have advanced,
I am aware that there are thoſe who will ſay,
that the whole of my theory is diſproved by
the inſtance of Holland. But let ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that what I have ſaid relates to the
policy of England only, and that though
Holland has ſubſiſted and become powerful
by trade alone, it has been owing to the
very particular circumſtances which have
attended the ſituation of the Dutch: they
eſtabliſhed themſelves in a little ſwampy
corner, hemmed in on all ſides by enemies,
whoſe reciprocal intereſt it was to protect
them againſt each other: by this means
their little ſpot became an aſylum for trade
to all parties, and thus they became like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the carriers and bankers of Europe,
and by theſe concomitant circumſtances,
art has ſupplied them with what nature
furniſhes us.</p>
            <p>But to return to the ſubject of horſes,
which, I am confident, have helped to
raiſe the price of proviſions, for they muſt
conſume a great part of the produce of
the earth, and in a much greater proportion
than other cattle, which are not fed ſo
highly. Therefore, unleſs it appears that
the importation of oats during theſe laſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0398000400:69"/>
twenty years has greatly increaſed, it is
evident that either the quantity of other corn
grown, has decreaſed, or that more ground
has been cultivated, and as certain that
unleſs the quantity of graſs land has increaſed
in the ſame degree, there cannot remain the
ſame proportion for the feeding of young
ſteers, as there was before the breeding of
theſe additional horſes. With regard to the
number that have been exported, as much
as it has been exclaimed againſt, ſurely no
man who conſiders the matter coolly can
ſee it in any other light than as being
greatly beneficial to the nation; for whether
we export the corn, or the cattle that feed
on it, the money received is for the produce
of the earth.</p>
            <p>We all know that more land has been
taken into culture, and that the incloſing of
common-field land has increaſed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce:
but, I am apt to believe, not in a
proportion equal to the conſumption; and
I am farther of opinion, that a greater part
has been devoted to the growth of food
for horſes: for the extraordinary riſe in the
price of oats within theſe twenty years paſt,
in which that grain has exceeded all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
with other corn, and the uniform
and ſteady price oats have kept at, are ſuch
inducements to a farmer, that it is ſcarcely
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0398000400:70"/>
poſſible to believe he would not attend to
the growth of that ſpecies of corn, as well
as, in the breeding countries, to the raiſing
of colts inſtead of ſteers: for a ſerviceable
colt, at three years old, with the aſſiſtance
of a few pecks of ground meal, will fetch
as much as an ox at ſeven, with a whole
ſummer's fattening. By theſe methods, I
believe, luxury has operated in the riſe of
proviſions: but ſurely no man will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
ſo dangerous a doctrine, as to ſay
that any thing which encourages agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
can be prejudicial to a ſtate.</p>
            <p>When I conſider the preſent ſtate of this
nation, it is evident to me, that our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
in a middling year, is but barely
equal to our conſumption: it is certain,
that by the great concourſe of the poorer
ſort of people to great cities, the conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of wheaten bread is greater than it was
when many of theſe fed on barley, rye,
or oats: nor has this ſpecies of luxury failed
to diffuſe itſelf thro' many country places.
It has likewiſe been demonſtrated by many,
but particularly by the ingenious author of
the Corn-Tracts, that the conſumption of
wheat has been nearly equal to the growth,
and that, even in the moſt plentiful years, our
exports have not amounted to above the value
of 947,000 <hi>l.</hi> Let thoſe who doubt this fact,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0398000400:71"/>
conſult Sir James Stewart's Enquiry into
the Principles of Political Oeconomy, vol. I.
page 58. If theſe are facts, it is pretty
evident to me, that our average crops do
but barely equal the conſumption, and
conſequently, that, when crops fail, we
muſt feel that deficiency. It is therefore
not to be wondered at, that if after five
ſucceſſive bad years, we ſhould be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
of want; at leaſt that proviſions
muſt riſe. The evil points out its own
remedy. If your conſumption is greater
than, or but equal to your produce, increaſe
the latter, and plenty muſt reduce the price:
for though other cauſes may operate in a
certain degree, plenty or ſcarcity muſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the price of all proviſions. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
can only be produced by a ſenſible
encouragement to the farmer, by convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
him that his intereſt is concerned in
it, by ſecuring to him a conſtant conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for his grain, that he may not be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to ruin by his trade being over-done.
As the means of doing this are evident to
me, though perhaps not to every one, I
ſhall point them out in the following
chapter.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="5" type="chapter">
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0398000400:72"/>
            <head>CHAPTER V. On the means of procuring plenty.</head>
            <p>MY principal aim in the foregoing
pages has been to prove that the
preſent advanced price of provisions is not
occaſioned by the ſuppoſed increaſe of large
farms, and to explain to the Legiſlature,
that though Luxury and Foreſtallers may
bear ſome proportion in the cauſe, the chief
one is real ſcarcity. For the truth of this,
I moſt ſincerely wiſh the Parliament would
examine ſuch men, from the different
counties of England, as they think they
can rely on: for a few partial examinations
cannot determine the point; as local cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
will ever miſguide. The aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of the whole will, I fear, prove what
I aſſert; and I am ſtill more concerned to
ſay, that it is not ſuſceptible of any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
relief. All that can be done by Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature,
as the laws now ſtand, has been
put in force; I mean, the opening of our
ports: But where is the corn to come
from? In Holland, it is as dear as with
us. The ports in Flanders and France are
ſhut. In the Baltic, they have been open
and ſhut ſeveral times within theſe twelve
months. Sicily is ſhut, except for a limited
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0398000400:73"/>
quantity to be exported for the uſe of the
Pope's dominions. In America, wheat is
now 5 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> ſterling the buſhel, and cannot
be imported here at our price. If theſe facts
are true, it will be allowed that there is no
great proſpect of immediate relief. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
is our only reſource. We have had
five ſucceſſive bad crops, and this laſt more
generally ſo than any of the former. It
has been nearly the ſame all over Europe:
therefore, till there is a plentiful year, corn
cannot be cheap. All that the Legiſlature
can do, is to endeavour to guard againſt
ſuch an evil befalling us again; and this,
in my opinion, is in their power: but,
ſalutary as the meaſure may be, it cannot
be effectually accompliſhed till corn is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
and nearly at an equal price all over
Europe.</p>
            <p>But corn is not the only article in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
that is thought too dear: meat bears
a juſt proportion to it, and till the latter is
reduced, it will be vain to expect a fall in
the former: in fact, they are, and ought
to be, ſo dependant on each other, that
the ſame cauſe will produce the ſame effects
in each; and it is clear to me, that more
land is wanted both for paſture and the
plough; for it is not to be diſputed that
the number of horſes kept in this country,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0398000400:74"/>
and the number neceſſary for breeding thoſe
that are exported, muſt conſume the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
of many of thoſe acres which would
be alloted to other purpoſes. This is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
one of the cauſes of proviſions
being riſen in price: but it is an evil at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with ſo great benefit, that it ought
to be endured; for it is an encouragement
to agriculture, and by whatſoever mode
this is encouraged, it will operate every
way to the advantage of this country,
which ought to conſider huſbandry as the
ſource of her wealth and ſtrength.</p>
            <p>The caſe is the ſame in regard to the
deſtruction of lambs and calves, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
conſume as much food as would
maintain a much greater number of rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtock: but this is a ſpecies of luxury
which, though attended with ſome preſent
inconveniencies, muſt be complied with;
excepting in particular times, as when a
murrain alarms the nation: for, excluſive
of the political ſenſe in which the national
advantage of agriculture ſould be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
it is dangerous to check the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
luxury of a free and wealthy people.
The extraordinary incentive which Britons
have, beyond all other nations, to exert
their ingenuity and induſtry, is a perfect
ſecurity for their enjoying the fruits of their
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0398000400:75"/>
labours as they pleaſe, uncontrouled by any
thing but the laws of the land, which
ſhould be, and are, a check on thoſe only
who wiſh to go beyond the bounds of civil
ſociety; for ſurely every one has a right to
enjoy his own inherited poſſeſſions; and
how much more ſo is that man entitled to
ſuch ſecurity, who acquires his by indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry?
Yet this ſecurity encourages luxury,
which, in ſome meaſure, increaſes the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
evil. Againſt this there is not, in
my opinion, any ſalutary remedy. A
government may indeed avail itſelf of the
folly of men, and raiſe a conſiderable ſum
by levying a ſevere tax on poſt-horſes, and
other different ſpecies of luxury; but how
far that is adviſeable, I humbly ſubmit to
Legiſlature. I am confident it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the revenue, for I am certain it would
increaſe the evil, as every man is proud of
vying with his neighbour in extravagance:
but if it is an evil, let it not meet with
ſuch encouragement, and let us attend to
thoſe points which only can afford real and
conſtant plenty, I mean, the cultivation of
more land; for though many waſte acres
have lately been brought into culture, it is
evident from what has been ſaid above,
that the quantity is not equal to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
conſumption: was it otherwiſe,
proviſions would be cheap, becauſe they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0398000400:76"/>
would be plentiful; which is the only
thing that can counterbalance the effect of
riches and luxury. In evidence of what I
ſay, let me remind the reader of the price
of proviſions, and even dainties, at Bath,
to which, though a place of diſſipation,
many reſort in order to live cheap.</p>
            <p>This being my idea, I ſhall not ſcruple
to point out, as the firſt neceſſary ſtep to
be taken, the incloſing and parcelling out
of all the King's Foreſts and Chaces, which
now lie a diſgrace to a Miniſter who wiſhes
to be thought to liſten to the complaints of
a nation. Let corn ſupply the place of
thoſe miſerable pollards, and let flocks and
herds ſupplant the half-ſtarved deer which
prowl about to tempt poor wretches to
the gallows; for it is deer-ſtealing that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
thoſe who are born on the chaces to
lead an idle life, which corrupts their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
and makes them the terror of every
honeſt man in their neighbourhood. Their
example likewiſe corrupts many who might
otherwiſe, probably, be uſeful induſtrious
ſubjects. By this a miniſter would entail
immortal honour on his adminiſtration, and
at the ſame time that the poor would be
employed and fed, the coffers of his Royal
Maſter would be filled. The taſk is not
in reality ſo very arduous as ſome may
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0398000400:77"/>
imagine, nor need the Miniſter who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
it fear the reſentment of thoſe who
derive to themſelves emoluments from the
preſent uſeleſs and deſolate ſtate of thoſe
otherwiſe truly valuable lands. Penſions
for their lives, far ſuperior to what they
can ever make by their foreſt-tenures, may
be ſecured to them, and yet a triple reſidue
be left to their Prince, who, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſtate of thoſe lands, can reap no other
benefit from them than that of providing
for a good ſervant, and that too in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
which no good man would wiſh.</p>
            <p>To anſwer the intended good purpoſe,
the undertaking muſt be conducted with
judgment, and a ſtrict attention to juſtice.
Let then the firſt ſtep be the bringing a bill
into Parliament, to oblige the ſeveral pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
and perſons who have right of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monage,
&amp;c. upon the King's foreſts, to
aſcertain thoſe rights, and to mark out
ſuch boundaries as ſhall be equivalent for
them, and let the turn of the ſcale be in
their favour; for the purpoſe of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
will be equally anſwered if theſe lands
are but appropriated: they will then by
degrees come into culture. Such rights as
ſhall not be aſcertained within a certain
limited time, to be ſettled by commiſſioners
appointed by Parliament; and what ſhall
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0398000400:78"/>
afterwards remain to the Crown, may be
diſpoſed of in the following manner;</p>
            <p>Allot to each cottager his few acres, and
to each little farmer ſuch proportion as he
can conveniently add to his farm; if many
of theſe two claſſes are near each other,
they will form an uſeful village: then let
the more open parts be divided into lots of
one hundred acres, and be put up to auction
on ſuch terms as the Crown can grant,
either for three lives, or upon leaſes of
thirty-one years, renewable every ſeven
years. When I ſay, lots of one hundred
acres, I do not mean to confine every pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer
to a ſingle lot: let every man pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
what tract he pleaſes; for, certainly,
it is from the opulent man that the greateſt
benefit is to be expected; but to ſecure that
benefit, let it be a condition, that within a
certain number of years, the whole of each
man's purchaſe ſhall be in culture, on pain
of forfeiture of his whole purchaſe, with
every partial improvement that has been
made thereon. This will ſecure to the
Crown ſuch purchaſers as can accompliſh
what they undertake, and will prevent the
land's being bought up by any rich indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
who may wiſh to preſerve it for
deer and moor-game: theſe are truly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolizers
of lands, and not thoſe who,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0398000400:79"/>
employing 10,000 <hi>l.</hi> in agriculture, can,
and do, make land produce more than the
little farmer who can barely ſubſiſt: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
both are neceſſary; for as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaid, every man's farm ought to be in
proportion to his capital, and thus both are
equally uſeful to the community. I repeat
this to ſhew, that though I think the little
farmer neceſſary, I would not wiſh the
opulent one to be excluded; and under the
reſtrictions I have mentioned, no evil can
enſue; for though theſe laws are not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
at the diſtance of America, yet here
they might with eaſe. Let every poſſible
encouragement be given to the undertakers:
let the firſt fine be in lieu of ſo many years
rent, which ſhould not commence before
the ſeventh year; let theſe lands remain for
ever free from tythe, &amp;c. making a proper
proviſion for the church by an allotment
of a certain number of acres; and for the
encouragement of cattle, let thoſe who work
oxen be exempted from a certain propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of rent: that may once more intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the uſe of thoſe noble animals. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
may prevail; but taxes and
reſtrictions operate too haſtily and too harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and will never anſwer any good end
in a free country. Let but the experiment
be made in one ſingle chace or foreſt, and
by the effect of that let the reſt be governed,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0398000400:80"/>
Let an accurate ſurvey be made, and the
different lots delineated: this will be the
only expence that will attend it; for each
lot will find its value. The only reſtriction
I would annex to the tenure ſhould be,
that thoſe lots which were converted into
arable land ſhould, within a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of years, have a barn and two cottages
erected on them; or, if intended for graſs,
ſheds and cottages ſuitable to the quantity
of land. Let all the trees, excepting only
ſuch as might be picked out for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
yards, and which ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly
marked, be included in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe-money of the lot on which they
ſtand. This will be a reciprocal advantage
to both: it will, on the one hand, ſave the
expence of removing them, and it will
enable the tenant either to preſerve ſome
in caſe of paſture land, or he will have
wood on the ſpot to erect the neceſſary
buildings. If ſuch a plan as this ſhould
ever take place, it would bring in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
revenue to the Crown, and ſet a
noble example to gentlemen of landed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
to convert their many barren acres
into uſeful paſture or corn-fields.</p>
            <p>A better authority can no where be
produced to ſupport my arguments on this
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0398000400:81"/>
occaſion, than that of the illuſtrious Mr.
Evelyn, in his <hi>Sylva.</hi> His advice on this
ſubject does honour to the country that
gave him birth. His deſcription of our
foreſts, in a quotation from Lawſon, points
out their deplorable ſtate in too lively co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;
nor have we reaſon to think they
have been improved in the courſe of theſe
laſt hundred years. "In our foreſts (ſays
he) you ſhall have for one lively thriving
tree, four, nay ſometimes twenty-four,
evil thriving, rotten, and dying trees; and
inſtead of trees, thouſands of buſhes and
ſhrubs. What rottenneſs, what hollowneſs,
what dead arms, withered tops, curtailed
trunks; what loads of moſs, dropping
boughs, and dying branches, ſhall you ſee
every where!"</p>
            <p>On this Mr. Evelyn juſtly obſerves, that
the condition they are in ſpeaks them to be
the property of a broken and decaying
freeholder; and adds, "Let not then the
Royal patrimony bear a bankrupt's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach."</p>
            <p>But when I quote ſuch an author, let
me here give his opinion of the mode in
which he thinks thoſe tracts can be made
moſt uſeful to the public.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0398000400:82"/>
"There is not, ſays he, a cheaper, eaſier,
or more prompt expedient to advance ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timber,
than to ſolicit that in all his Majeſty's
foreſts, woods, and parks, the ſpreading
oak, &amp;c. be cheriſhed by plowing and ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."
He ſuppoſes the royal foreſts to
contain about 200,000 acres, and after
pointing out the method of improving them,
concludes in the following words: "The
care of ſo public and honourable an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
is a right noble and royal under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking;
and I do pronounce it more
worthy of a Prince who truly conſults
his glory in the higheſt intereſt of his
ſubjects, than that of gaining battles or
ſubduing a province."</p>
            <p>Mr. Evelyn has ſo properly recommended
a provident care of timber for the navy,
and ſo judiciouſly pointed out the method in
which it ſhould be managed, that I cannot
but hope ſome attention may be paid to the
inſtructions of ſo juſtly-celebrated a man:
therefore all that I ſhall propoſe to myſelf
here will be to make my plan coincide as
much as poſſible with his ideas. He tells
us, that to procure good timber, every oak
ſhould ſtand ſingle, and that the frequent
plowing of the ground will cheriſh and
nouriſh the roots ſo as to make the tree
thrive amazingly: but, though it is with
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0398000400:83"/>
the utmoſt diffidence that I ſhall venture
to offer an opinion in competition with
him, I cannot help remarking, that if his
plan is properly executed over the whole
foreſt, all thoughts of converting it into
arable muſt drop, for the ſhade of thoſe
trees diſpoſed as he recommends would
render it unfit for corn; and it is as certain,
that if they were confined to hedge-rows
they would not become ſuch fine timber,
for the ditches, which would naturally be
cloſe to them, muſt prevent the extenſion
of ſome of their roots, and the buſhes and
briars would injure them by excluding the
air from their trunks. I would therefore
propoſe, that half of the land be dedicated
to paſture, where the trees might ſtand ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
over the fields, and the diſtance which
Mr. Evelyn allots them would rather benefit
than prejudice the paſturage, as well as
afford ſhade for the cattle. By conſtant
feeding, the ground will certainly be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched,
and if it is likewiſe kept free from
buſhes, I cannot ſee why the trees upon it
ſhould not thrive nearly, if not quite, as
well as if it was cultivated by the plough,
which operation could be almoſt ſolely for
their benefit, as the crops that might grow
there would, I doubt, ſcarcely repay the
expence of labour. The remaining half of
the ground would be ſufficient to grow corn
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0398000400:84"/>
for the inhabitants of the foreſt, who could
not be very numerous under this culture,
together with cabbages, turnips, and fodder
for the beaſts in the winter: thus, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing,
as Mr. Evelyn does, that there are
two hundred thouſand acres of land in the
foreſts, &amp;c. one hundred thouſand of them
will be paſture. To the four trees which he
allots to each acre, making in all 400,000
trees, I ſhall add in the intermediate ſpaces,
an equal number for ſucceſſion; and I
would have all the paſture land be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
by a nurſery well ſecured with
double fences.</p>
            <p>This is the way in which, I think, the
foreſts and chaces may be converted to the
greateſt uſe: for whether they are employed
in breeding and fattening of cattle, or in
growing of corn, they will equally anſwer
the intended purpoſe of producing plenty;
and in this manner a valuable treaſure will
be kept up for the navy. As to the mode
of accompliſhing it, that requires only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination;
for the buſineſs is then done.
Let the conditions of planting, fencing,
and preſerving, be annexed to the leaſe,
under a forfeiture of it upon non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with the terms; and in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the trouble and expence of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the trees and nurſeries, let there be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0398000400:85"/>
a proportionate deduction in the rent. An
annual ſurvey, by an honeſt man, would
eaſily enforce the execution of whatever
might be propoſed.</p>
            <p>If what I have thrown out on this ſubject
ſhould either coincide with the general
opinion, or afford any hint for a better plan,
I ſhall think myſelf happy. But at the
ſame time that I deliver theſe as my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in regard to the advantage which
would accrue to the Public from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure
and cultivation of the royal foreſts
and chaces, I confeſs that it is without even
the ſmalleſt hope of ever ſeeing any part of
this plan put in execution. Many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which muſt be obvious to every one
who knows the diſtribution of places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
on theſe foreſts, ſeem almoſt inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable.—I
therefore beg leave to offer
another plan, one that is practicable, and
which cannot fail to do honour to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of the Miniſter who ſhall effect
it. Let a ſum of money be voted to his
Majeſty, to purchaſe a tract of land on the
moors, and let this land be put into the
hands of an intelligent induſtrious man, to
improve it; and let the profit be his reward.
The ſum thus ſunk will be the only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
incurred by Government; and ſuch
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0398000400:86"/>
an example to men of landed property
will be truly worthy of a great King.</p>
            <p>When I appear ſo ſtrenuous an advocate
for cultivating waſte lands, it may readily
be believed, that I ſhall recommend as
ſtrongly the giving of every poſſible encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to incloſing bills. Let not the
miſtaken zeal of well-diſpoſed, but ignorant
people, perſuade the man of ſenſe that it is
prejudicial to the Poor. Create but work
for them, and their numbers cannot be too
great; nor will they want bread. The
benefit which they are ſuppoſed to reap
from commons, in their preſent ſtate, I
know to be merely nominal; nay, indeed,
what is worſe, I know, that, in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
it is an eſſential injury to them, by
being made a plea for their idleneſs; for,
ſome few excepted, if you offer them work,
they will tell you, that they muſt go to look
up their ſheep, cut furzes, get their cow
out of the pound, or perhaps ſay they muſt
take their horſe to be ſhod, that he may
carry them to a horſe-race or cricket-match.
The firſt is plauſible; but I am ſorry to ſay
merely ſo, becauſe the benefit which the
ſheep are of either to himſelf or the
country is not an object worth notice: the
little care that ſuch people can take of them,
frequently occaſions the loſs of their lambs,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0398000400:87"/>
and the difficulty, nay indeed impoſſibility,
of ſupporting them in the winter, is the
death of the few ſcrubby things which
have been eating the graſs that would have
maintained an uſeful flock: but if there is
a farmer in the neighbourhood who does
keep a flock, then the benefit which the
cottager would have, even in the ſummer,
muſt vaniſh; for if there is a ſhepherd to
this flock, he will take care that his ſheep
have the beſt of the feed; and what is
more remarkable, though true, is, that if
a large flock are daily turned out on a
common by themſelves, they only will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the benefit of it, and the common
ſheep will fly before them to ſeek their
miſerable ſuſtenance among the buſhes and
furzes. It is on this account that our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
circumſtanced as they generally are,
without limitation, are advantageous only
to the moſt conſiderable men of the pariſh;
whereas, if they were incloſed, they would
produce twice the quantity of food if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
for paſture, becauſe the furzes would
be grubbed up; or if they were divided,
they would produce their proportion of
corn. I mention theſe trivial circumſtances
in anſwer to ſome gentlemen who, I am
convinced, oppoſe incloſures from a laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſpirit of taking care of the Poor,
which I would propoſe doing in a much
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0398000400:88"/>
more effectual manner in all future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures.</p>
            <p>My plan is, to allot to each cottage three
or four acres, which ſhould be annexed to
it without power of alienation, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
rent; but under the covenant of being
kept in graſs, except ſuch ſmall part as
ſhould be neceſſary for a garden: this would
keep the cottager in more plenty than a
very extenſive range of common: he and
his family muſt then cultivate the garden,
or ſuffer as they ought to do: and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
the plea of their wanting fuel, let it
be fenced and planted with aſh and other
quick growing trees, at the expence of
thoſe who are to have the property of the
common. This would be a real benefit to
him, as it would employ his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and help to ſupport his family whilſt
he is at work for the farmers in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
inſtead of depending, as they
too often do, upon the ſuppoſed profits of
their commonage. The commons in the
pariſh of Chailley in Suſſex afford remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
inſtances of what I advance. Mr.
Young obſerves, in Vol. iii. p. 153, of the
Farmer's Tour, that in that pariſh the rates
are 9<hi>s.</hi> in the pound; and on enquiry into
the cauſe of it, found, that it was owing
to the extenſiveneſs of the commons, which
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0398000400:89"/>
induced many to rely on the cows and ſheep
they could keep, to exempt them from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
the conſequence of which was their
coming on the pariſh upon any loſs they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in their cattle, having acquired that idle
habit which would not permit them to work.
Inſtead of this, an induſtrious life leads them
to a knowledge of thoſe real and reaſonable
comforts which I wiſh them to enjoy; ſuch
as, a good dwelling decently furniſhed, they
and their children well fed and clad; and
if theſe laſt are early brought up to honeſt
labour, inſtead of pilfering, there cannot
be a better ſecurity for their not becoming
a burden to the pariſh.</p>
            <p>I am aware that there may be objections
ſtarted to what I have now propoſed, by
ſaying, that though this land may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
to the preſent occupier, yet it will be
in the power of the landlord, provided it is
not the cottager's own, to raiſe the rent, or
that, when the cottagers families grow up,
and more cottages are built, the ground
being all diſpoſed of, there will not remain
any to annex to the new cottages. In my
opinion, theſe difficulties are eaſily obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated;
for as the landlords are to be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
by their proportion of the common,
they may, by the ſame act, be reſtrained
from raiſing the rents of the old ones; and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0398000400:90"/>
as the land-holders are the only people who
will build, or grant building leaſes, they
may be obliged in future to annex to each
new-erected cottage an equal proportion of
land.</p>
            <p>There is indeed one other reſtrictive
clauſe which I would add to theſe incloſing
bills, I mean when commons are to be
converted into arable land: it is, that for
every hundred acres of arable land, the
proprietor ſhould be obliged to erect a barn
and threſhing-floor; for confident I am that
there are frequently large tracts of land
which have not a ſufficient number of them,
and that by this means the farmer is often
accuſed of retaining his corn, when in fact
he cannot threſh it out ſo faſt as he would
wiſh to do.</p>
            <p>Another improvement in which legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
can interfere, is the incloſure of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-field
land, which I know requires their
cordial aſſiſtance as much, if not more,
than the commons I have been ſpeaking of;
for, in the preſent ſtate of thoſe lands,
they are not capable of producing half
what they would otherwiſe do, unleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the whole belongs to ſome very few,
who are ſenſible enough to agree among
themſelves on a good mode of culture; but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0398000400:91"/>
this is rarely the caſe: and though it may
appear ridiculous to ſome of my readers
that I enter ſo minutely into the little detail
of farming, I cannot refrain from enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
the many diſadvantages which attend
their preſent ſituation, that I may be the
better able to point out the benefit that
would accrue to the nation if they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
and properly divided. The general
face of ſuch common-fields, being divided
into narrow ſlips, makes it obvious to every
traveller, whether converſant in farming or
not, that they belong to different tenants,
and it is a certain fact, that, frequently, a
man who rents one hundred acres will not
have ten acres adjoining to each other, but,
often, ſcattered over the whole tract in
ſmall parcels, ſometimes ſo ſmall as half
acres, but often in ſingle acres. It will
not require much rhetoric to prove, even
to a man not converſant in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that this muſt occaſion great loſs of
time in ſending the horſes and men from
ſpot to ſpot, in plowing, carting, or in
harveſt time; nor is it neceſſary to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
that waſte of labour is waſte of
produce. Beſides, by theſe ſmall diviſions
there is generally a real waſte of land, and
in many countries a very conſiderable one,
commonly called <hi>balks.</hi> Theſe balks are of
different widths, from two to ſixteen feet:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0398000400:92"/>
they are never ploughed, but are kept in
graſs, under pretence of their being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-field
paſture. They are, literally, of
no benefit to either the occupier or the Poor;
for they are too narrow either to mow, or
to graze without a boy to attend each beaſt
with a halter; and when the corn is off,
their graſs is too old to feed: nor ought the
common-field to be kept open till it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
for that muſt prevent putting in
wheat in the proper ſeaſon, and is a total
prohibition of turnips and cabbages, often
ſo neceſſary to the farmer, and conſequently
to the country. Likewiſe, the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which the plough gives to the ſides of
theſe balks encourages the graſs and other
weeds to run into the farmer's corn-land.
In many inſtances too, where a bad courſe
of huſbandry prevails, and while the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-field
tenure is ſuch that the whole muſt
be governed by the cuſtom of the field, it
prevents all improvement let an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
be ever ſo induſtrious: it will be ſaid
that he has his land accordingly; but that
is what I lament.</p>
            <p>Can there be a clearer proof of the
national advantage of incloſing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
dividing the land, than that the
farmer will chearfully give double the rent
for the ſame land when incloſed? Does not
this point out, that he can make it produce
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0398000400:93"/>
more; and is it not as clear that the nation
muſt be benefited by that increaſe?</p>
            <p>I ſhould not have dwelt ſo long on this
tedious ſubject, but that I am perſuaded
plenty is wanting, and that theſe are the
moſt likely means to procure it: when
that is done, then, and not till then, is the
time for the legiſlature to take up the great
object of a free port for corn: then, let
every act that regards the corn laws be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed;
make the trade free and open for
export or import at all times and on all
occaſions, without the leaſt reſtraint; aboliſh
every port-charge, nay even the ſmalleſt
incumbrance: let corn flow like water, and
it will find its level. Then, and by that
means only, will be introduced a ſet of
traders which this country never knew; I
mean, <hi>Corn-Merchants,</hi> who will moſt
chearfully embark in a commerce where ſo
quick returns are made. Watchful of their
neighbours, and attentive to their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
they will not miſs an opportunity of
ſupplying the market that is in want. If
corn is plentiful here and ſcarce abroad,
they will export: that will naturally give
a ſtart to the market, and the riſe of the
market will as naturally ſtop the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation.
Thus will the price of corn
always be nearly on an equal footing,
and not ſubject to the great variations which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0398000400:94"/>
muſt ever be the conſequence when the
opening or ſhutting of the port depends
on the price at Bear-key, where an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
riſe or fall may ever miſlead the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature,
while a few individuals will reap
the ſole benefit of what is calculated for a
national advantage; not without danger,
ſometimes, of bringing on a famine:
whereas if the corn-trade was perfectly
free, men of capital would engage in it,
and the price of corn would be as well
regulated and as well known as the price
of exchange, which is alternately in favour
of London, Amſterdam, Hamburgh, and
Cadiz, as circumſtances direct, and in which
there cannot be any craft. The balance
would, from time to time, be in favour of
the exporter. This is a fact, and as well
known as that the courſe of exchange points
out in whoſe favour is the balance of trade;
which is, in other words, that the country
which exports moſt of its own produce, muſt
have the greateſt remittance made to it.</p>
            <p>The dread which ſome may have of
monopolies, cannot bear an argument; for,
by the account lately laid before the Houſe
of Commons, the yearly produce of wheat
alone is ſaid to be 4,000,000 of quarters,
which I believe far ſhort of the reality<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Young</hi>'s Northern Tour, vol. IV. p. 349.</note>;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0398000400:95"/>
but even that quantity, at 30 <hi>s.</hi> a quarter,
would amount to 6,000,000<hi>l. per ann.</hi>
Will any man, or ſet of men, dream of ſuch
a monopoly? eſpecially as, if it ſhould take
place, it could not fail of being doubled in
a few years; for as it is the ſteady and
uniform price of a commodity which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
the real merchant, ſuch as this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
once knew, to embark his capital, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, the ſame would operate with the
farmer. Let us not run away with a notion
that the growth of corn is not to be adopted
as a ſyſtem of trade, as much as the growth
of rice, or ſugar-canes. Whatever may be
the opinion of men in great cities, I know
it ought to be, I know it is; for there is
not a good farmer in any country, who has
not a regular ſyſtem in his buſineſs, and
who does not adopt an uniform courſe of
crops. In confirmation of what I ſay, look
to Norfolk, where the courſe is regularly
turnips, barley, clover, wheat: Does not
this prove, that the farmer prefers a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
certain profit to the chance-gain of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
huſbandry? Is it not then as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the farmers would prefer the
reaſonable profits of a ſteady market, to the
preſent uncertainty which keeps them in
conſtant alarm? and with how much more
pleaſure would they deal with the open
fair trader, from whom they could not fail
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0398000400:96"/>
having the price of the market, than with
the preſent ſpeculators, of whom they are
ever jealous, and always ſuſpicious that
when ſuch buyers appear in markets, ſome
ſudden riſe is expected? But without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
them this degree of common ſenſe,
and even ſuſpecting them of the practice
of retaining their corn, the freedom of the
trade in which ſuch capitals would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
would force their corn to market:
exportation would induce them to ſend it
thither; and importation would render their
ſcheme of retention abortive. I have juſt
mentioned theſe few circumſtances relative
to the farmer, to prove that the freedom of
the trade muſt encourage agriculture, and
that the natural conſequence muſt be an
increaſe in the produce: if ſo, it is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that England muſt always have a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus
to export, and the national advantage
that will accrue therefrom cannot, I believe,
require explanation.</p>
            <p>To thoſe whoſe views do not extend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the bellies of the poor, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a ſtronger argument. Look up to
Amſterdam, and wonder how that city,
with every natural diſadvantage that can
attend the corn-trade, has, for many years
paſt, been the magazine of Europe; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
ſpeaking, without a blade of corn
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0398000400:97"/>
growing in its country, with one of the
worſt ports in the German Ocean, the
<hi>Texel,</hi> and with a mud-bank within two
leagues of the city, namely the <hi>Pompus,</hi>
which will not float a veſſel even of two
hundred tuns, except in ſpring-tides; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
I ſay, that this city ſhould ſupply all
Europe. The reaſon is, that there the trade
is free, and there the moſt wealthy people
of the country are corn merchants. I ſpeak
within bounds when I ſay, that one half
of the trade of the city of Amſterdam is
corn. Corn was as plentiful there, and as
cheap as it had been for ſome years before,
when, in 1767, England was under the
greateſt apprehenſions of a famine; and
when it was neceſſary to take, during the
receſs of Parliament, a ſtep which this
country cannot yet have forgot.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to this it may be aſked, By
what accident then were the Dutch in ſuch
diſtreſs for corn the laſt year? The reaſon
is obvious: too great ſecurity will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
put men off their guard; unuſed to
know the want of corn, they might inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertently
go too great lengths before they
perceived the miſchief; the intended mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly
of the courts of Vienna and Berlin,
added to the diſtreſs of Poland, might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the general ſcarcity, and prevent
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0398000400:98"/>
their uſual ſupplies. The like could not
probably befal us, who are naturally ſo
averſe to the idea of monopolizing, and
conſequently would be ever on the watch.
Beſides, our ſupplies are within ourſelves,
and would, I am confident, annually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
            <p>I am aware that there is another ſort
of men who would oppoſe the free expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
on a more plauſible foundation,
namely, the danger of our manufacturers
wanting bread, and being thereby rendered
uſeleſs ſubjects, as the raiſing of their prices
would fix a prohibition on their goods in
foreign markets. To theſe I ſhall reply,
that profuſe plenty in manufacturing towns
does not produce more labour, but the
contrary. It is a fact well known to thoſe
who are converſant in that matter, that
ſcarcity, to a certain degree, promotes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
and that the manufacturer who can
ſubſiſt on three days work, will be idle
and drunken the remainder of the week.
I ſhall proceed yet farther, and ſay, that
thoſe manufactures in which foreigners can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
vye with us, will go abroad under
every diſadvantage that may attend them
in regard to price; ſuch as Sheffield and
Birmingham hard-wares—France muſt and
will have them at any rate. In proof of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0398000400:99"/>
what I ſay, we have continued to ſupply
that country with them, notwithſtanding
their threat when Mr. C. Townſhend was
Chancellor of the Exchequer, that unleſs
we would permit the importation of cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks,
&amp;c. they would prohibit the uſe
of our hard-ware, and ſome other of our
manufactures. So it will ever be with our
woollen manufactures of Norwich, Leeds,
Exeter, Colcheſter, and Saliſbury; conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in bays, druggets, long-ells, ſhalloons,
duroys, flannels, &amp;c. theſe will go to Italy,
Spain, Portugal, and Germany, and even
into the South of France through Genoa.
Ruſſia and the Northern parts muſt have
the Leeds manufactory; and Holland and
Flanders ſome particular articles in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
quantities. And let it be obſerved,
that theſe articles are the moſt beneficial
objects in our woollen manufactory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made of all Engliſh wool, whereas
broad-cloth muſt be part Spaniſh. As to
the trade to the Levant, which we have
loſt, it has not been owing to the price,
but to the cloth being of an improper qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
France, which has been long in the
uſe of making the thin cloths which are
required at that market, muſt have the
trade; whilſt our manufacturers, ignorantly
and obſtinately perſiſting in making that
ſtrong cloth which we pride ourſelves in,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0398000400:100"/>
cannot ſell a piece. Many attempts have
been made to obtain the thin cloth; ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
have been ſent over to our merchants;
the Society of Arts, Manufactures, and
Commerce, throw out premiums, but all to
no purpoſe. Not that this was the only
cauſe of our loſing that part of the Levant
trade, for, notwithſtanding the precautions
at Blackwell-hall, frauds were committed
by our traders that did diſhonour to this
nation. However, allowing every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
which attends the exportation of our
manufactures, in which the corn that fed
the manufacturers is exported to double ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
by feeding thoſe men whoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
we export, it will be agreed, that
the demand for our manufactures is limited,
and that, under particular treaties of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
or ruptures with ſtates, a total pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of them may take place. That
never can be the caſe with corn; a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
inſtance of which appeared in the
year 1748, when the French, though at
war with us, contracted for 400,000 quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
There cannot be a more glaring proof
than this, of the great national benefit
that would attend the free exportation of
grain; and if that can be done, with as
great a certainty of having corn cheap at
home, is not that country mad, who have
it naturally in their power, and will not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0398000400:101"/>
adopt the ſcheme. That plenty, and a more
equal price, which I will maintain is the
great encouragement to the farmer, has
been produced by exportation, no man
who has read the hiſtory of this country
can deny.</p>
            <p>In 1689, an act paſſed to give a bounty
on the exportation of corn, with repeal of
cuſtoms on exportation. The wife intention
of the Legiſlature is evident; it was to
increaſe agriculture, I mean the plough,
for that had ever been neglected; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
conſequence of a continued ſcene of
inteſtine broils. What was the conſequence?
Corn became cheaper, and was reduced
from 2<hi>l.</hi> 4<hi>s.</hi> 4<hi>d.</hi> to 1<hi>l.</hi> 15<hi>s.</hi> 1<hi>d.</hi> in 1756.
The wiſdom of this law, and its ſalutary
effects during a courſe of ſeventy years,
ſufficiently proves the ſtrength of my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
namely, that exportation, which
is conſumption, will encourage agriculture,
that this will produce plenty, and that
plenty muſt naturally reduce the price.
The facts which I allude to have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately
ſtated, and the advantages ariſing
from the exportation of corn clearly proved
by the author of the Corn Tracts, from
whom I differ in opinion only with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to retaining the bounty, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any reſtraint whatever in the corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trade.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0398000400:102"/>
A perfect freedom is all that is now
requiſite; but that freedom ought to be
without the leaſt check or controul: the
very motive for inſtituting the bounty,
proves that it is now needleſs.</p>
            <p>In former years, when England was
divided into many little principalities, and
conſequently in eternal warfare, flocks and
herds were the natural riches of the people,
as being eaſily removed: the plough was
of courſe neglected. In the year 1537, the
ſize of flocks was limited to 2000, and in
1547 it was reduced to 1550. This was
done to encourage the plough; and to the
ſame end commons were incloſed. In 1563,
the exportation of corn was allowed, and
this continued in force, under different
modes, till 1688, when a bounty thereon
was firſt granted. Thus was agriculture
firſt nouriſhed; and of ſuch conſequence
was it deemed in a national light, that a
bounty was given to the farmer to indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
him in an undertaking which might
afterwards prove beneficial to the nation.
In ſhort, that wife legiſlature knew that
the produce of the earth, whether gold, lead,
or corn, was the riches of the ſtate, and
it was a ſenſible encouragement to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to ſearch for thoſe riches in the bowels
of the earth. In no other light could it
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0398000400:103"/>
be ſeen: for if it was ſuppoſed that the
huſbandman could only continue to ſupport
himſelf by his labour, and that there would
be no ſurplus to export, or that foreigners
ſhould be bribed to purchaſe that ſurplus at
an equivalent to the value of the national
gain, what benefit could enſue? It was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
meant, as in the whale and herring
fiſhery, to indemniſy adventurers in a
hazardous undertaking: but when that
undertaking ceaſes to be hazardous, and the
trade is become beneficial, the encouragement
is no longer neceſſary. Such is now the
ſituation of our agriculture; and happily
for this country it is in ſo flouriſhing a
ſtate, that all the farmer requires is perfect
liberty to ſell when and where he pleaſes:
but that cannot take place, unleſs the ſame
free liberty be given to people to become
purchaſers, which can never happen ſo long
as the leaſt reſtraint hangs over the trade.
The merchant, who engages his capital,
muſt be as uncontrouled in the ſale as in the
purchaſe, and the benefit which the nation
is to expect from the interference of the
merchant naturally is, that he will ſettle
proper correſpondencies abroad, as well as
that he will be intimately acquainted with
the ſtate of our markets at home; in ſhort,
he will be in corn, what the great remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancer
is in bills of exchange: but if we
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0398000400:104"/>
are to expect the merchant to import when
he finds the nation is in want of it, a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
muſt be given to himſelf and his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents,
that their property is ſafe, and
that if their corn comes to a bad market,
they ſhall have liberty to take it back again,
and not be treated in the manner they were
in 1767: for when their cargoes then came
into the river, the factors took the alarm,
and ſunk the price below what the foreign
corn could be fold at: nor were the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters
ſuffered to carry it out again; but
here their corn lay till it was damaged, and
ſold to feed hogs. This muſt ever be the
caſe with a partial opening or ſhutting of
the ports. An artificial price, made for the
purpoſe by deſigning ſchemers, may ever
miſguide; nor can legiſlature rely on the
information they are likely to obtain, at leaſt
not in ſo ſhort a time as may be requiſite;
and under theſe circumſtances, depend on
it, foreigners will ever be averſe to ſend us
corn; for if, as in the abovementioned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
they are only to be made uſe of as
tools to check the villainy of our own
traders, they will not ſubmit to it; but if the
trade was perfectly open, they would deal
with us in that as in other commodities.</p>
            <p>How much more favourably are we ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
than the Dutch to ſupply all Europe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0398000400:105"/>
with corn! But to do that there muſt not
be the ſmalleſt incumbrance whatever on the
trade; not even the ſlighteſt port-charge.
Let freight and inſurance be the only bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.
Theſe, for exportation, are, in time
of peace,

A ſaving of this to the exporter, with any
riſe of our market, would naturally ſtop too
great an exportation. To prove the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of what I aſſert, let any one examine
Mr. Cook's corn-tables as publiſhed by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of parliament. It will be found,
throughout the whole of them, that, all
along the coaſt where corn has been ſhipped
off to ſupply the London market, and
under that pretence, with ſtill greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to France, corn has been uniformly
cheaper than in the inland counties. There
may, indeed, likewiſe be other reaſons for
it; but I am confident the chief one is,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0398000400:106"/>
that there being a conſtant demand, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
ſource of plenty flows in; and though
the temptations to ſhip off have been great,
a ſaving of freight and inſurance has been
thought an adequate profit to the merchant.</p>
            <p>I am aware that, though there may be
ſome who will agree with me that expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
will encourage agriculture, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
produce plenty, yet others will
ſay, that free importation may be as great a
check, and under particular circumſtances
ruin the farmer, and thus affect the landed
intereſt; that is, if by chance crops ſhould
fail in this country, and there ſhould be
univerſal plenty every where elſe, corn
might be imported at a much lower price
than the farmer could afford to ſell it for;
this might occaſion a loſs to him, which
this country cannot wiſh, nor ought to
permit; for it would naturally be a total
diſcouragement to tillage.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee how this matter is likely to
operate. The only country, in my opinion,
from whence we can apprehend ſuch an
importation is America; where, ſome ſay,
they can afford to export at 20<hi>s.</hi> but to this
muſt be added, commiſſion, freight, inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

            <p>By the foregoing eſtimate, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
on an excellent courſe of huſbandry
upon land that is proper for it, it appears
that the farmer may, by great care and with
good luck, obtain about 25 <hi>per cent. per ann.</hi>
but to do this he muſt ſell his wheat at 46 <hi>s.</hi>
8 <hi>d.</hi> and his barley at 24 <hi>s.</hi> It muſt likewiſe
be obſerved, that it is not every ſoil that
will admit of a courſe attended with ſo
much profit. However, the concluſion to
be drawn from the above ſeems to be this,
viz. that to obtain this profit, the produce
of an acre of wheat ſhould ſell for 7 <hi>l.</hi> His
expences will always be nearly the ſame,
but his crop may vary, therefore his wheat
ſhould ſell in proportion to his crop; for
example:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0398000400:113"/>
               <list>
                  <item>When he has
5 Qrs.
he can ſell at
28—7<hi>l. s.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
When he has 4 ½ he can ſell at about
31</item>
                  <item>
When he has 4 he can ſell at about
35</item>
                  <item>
When he has 3 ½ he can ſell at about
40</item>
                  <item>When he has 3 he can ſell at about
46 8 <hi>d.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
When he has 2 ½ he can ſell at about
56</item>
                  <item>
When he has 2 he can ſell at about
70</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Here it is worthy of obſervation, that by
the above table it appears that when the
farmer has three quarters he can afford to
ſell at 46 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> and as the average of the
various opinions of the produce of an acre
is between 3 Q. and 2½ Q. which would
require a price of about 51 <hi>s.</hi> it ſeems to
account for the bounty having been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to 48 <hi>s.</hi> as ſuppoſing that a price the
farmer could not afford to ſell at; for tho'
at that price there appears now to be a very
handſome profit, it muſt be remembered,
that agriculture was in thoſe days in a very
unimproved ſtate, and attended with much
greater expence, which muſt have rendered
a much leſs profit; however, it is evident
that the fixing the bounty at 48 <hi>s.</hi> was the
work of upright and intelligent men, but
proves that in the preſent improved ſtate of
agriculture, the farmer can afford to ſell
much cheaper, and that indeed no bounty
is requiſite; but if any, that it ſhould not
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0398000400:114"/>
exceed 40 <hi>s.</hi> It likewiſe proves, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that we need not dread the effects
of importation from America; for though
land there is cheap, labour is dear, and
therefore there is little cauſe to believe that
they can underſell us in Europe: nor is it
reaſonable to believe that agriculture is there
ſo good; and though that climate may be,
and is fine, it is not to be expected that
they ſhould always have plentiful harveſts
when we have ſcanty ones, without which
they would be but on a par with us; for
ſuppoſing the advantage of climate and
cheapneſs of land to be in their favour,
the expence of freight, &amp;c. will always
make an addition of at leaſt 14 <hi>s.</hi> per
quarter. But there is yet another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
which is, that if corn ſhould be
very dear here, we may reſt aſſured they
would have a profit in ſome proportion to
ſuch dearneſs. The truth of this is pretty
evident from the preſent price of wheat
in America, it being now 5 <hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> ſterling
the buſhel there, and cannot be imported
here at our preſent high price: but were it
otherwiſe; ſuppoſe the farmer ſhould be
curtailed in his profit for one year, it
would not be his ruin. As to any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
that may come from other parts of
the world, I am confident they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
the Engliſh farmer: it is true that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0398000400:115"/>
Holland has formerly imported great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of wheat from Poland, and rye from
Ruſſia: but when we conſider the preſent
diviſion of Poland, and that Dantzig, thro'
which it muſt paſs, is in the hands of
Pruſſia, there is greater reaſon to believe
that the Dutch will come to us for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
than that we need fear an influx from
Poland.</p>

               <head>SECTION IV. On Markets.</head>
               <p>WHEN I appear ſo ſtrong an advocate
for free import and export, it will be
conceived that I am not leſs ſtrenuous for a
perfect freedom in markets: every reſtraint
in the ſale of a commodity, is a check on
the trade, and muſt neceſſarily enhance the
price of the commodity.</p>
               <p>The abſurd law of obliging farmers to
bring their corn to market, and not ſell by
ſample, can anſwer no good purpoſe: as
often as it has been attempted to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced,
it has done miſchief; it has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the farmer from expoſing his corn to
ſale: for can it be imagined that the grower
will ſubmit to be the dupe to the crafty pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer,
or is it reaſonable that he ſhould?
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0398000400:116"/>
Real plenty, or real ſcarcity, will fix the
ſtandard price, and as he muſt ſubmit to the
one, it is as reaſonable that he ſhould reap
the benefit of the other: but ſuppoſing it
could be enforced, the line of the law can
admit of deviation in the defaulter; thus,
ſuppoſe a farmer and a miller to be next<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door
neighbours, with a market at ten miles
diſtance; is it agreeable to common ſenſe,
that the farmer ſhould employ a team of
horſes which may be wanted in the plough,
to carry to market that corn which he or
the miller muſt bring back again? muſt it
not naturally inhance the price? and muſt
not that fall upon the Poor, for whoſe ſake
the law was ſuppoſed to be made?</p>
               <p>To enumerate the many inconveniencies
that attend reſtrictions in the corn-trade,
would be endleſs. Turn but your eyes to
France, and view the inconveniencies they
laboured under for ſo many years, by adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that barbarous feudal ſyſtem in their
corn laws! Happily for that country, a ſet
of worthy virtuous men, who are as able
politicians as they are truly patriots, have,
by their publications, opened the eyes of
their Government, who are now making
great ſtrides in revoking thoſe reſtrictive
laws, equally abſurd and injurious to the
nation and the individual. Our laws indeed
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0398000400:117"/>
have not been ſo rigid; but ſuch as they
are, I hope the legiſlature will totally aboliſh
them. Let this be their firſt ſtep; it may be
done without danger of leſſening our corn-trade,
and is one of the neceſſary preludes
to the great work of making free ports,
which neither can or ought to be done till
corn is plentiful, and at nearly an equal
price all over Europe.</p>

                  <hi>A ſhort Account of the</hi> CORN TRADE
<hi>of</hi> AMSTERDAM.</p>
               <p>OF all the arguments that can be urged
in ſupport of a free corn trade, none
will carry with it that conviction which
is to be obtained by a candid inquiry into
the ſtate of that of Amſterdam. It is
indeed my knowledge of ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
relative to that branch of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
which makes me ſo ſtrong an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
for the freedom I recommend. I
ſhall therefore, in ſupport of my opinion,
give an account of the nature of the trade
of that city, and the circumſtances that
attend it in conſequence of its ſituation.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin by informing my Reader,
that the moſt conſiderable merchants, and
moſt opulent people of Amſterdam, are
engaged in this trade: it is not indeed well
poſſible to aſcertain the fund employed in
it, as that muſt vary with the annual growth
of the countries from whence it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
which was chiefly Poland, by the
way of Dantzig, with ſome ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
from Riga; though this laſt indeed
has conſiſted moſtly in rye. Since the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances
in Poland, Amſterdam has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0398000400:119"/>
large quantities of wheat from Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel,
Peterſburgh, and ſeveral other ports
in the gulf of Finland; but they have
not been ſufficient to preſerve the uſual
plenty, and evidently account for the ſcarcity
that city experienced theſe two laſt years.</p>
               <p>So thoroughly are the Dutch convinced
of the national advantage which attends the
freedom of their corn trade, that though
there was at one period ſo great an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of ſcarcity that they would not permit
the exportation of potatoes, roots, or any
other kind of proviſion, yet they would
not ſuffer the freedom of their corn trade to
be infringed. Exportation continued as
free as their importation, though wheat
was then 240 gold guilders <hi>per</hi> laſt, or
168 current guilders <hi>per</hi> half laſt, equal to
about 16 <hi>l.</hi> ſterling <hi>per</hi> load. It is true
indeed that there are ſome ſmall duties and
port charges, ſuch as 6 guilders <hi>per</hi> laſt,
which is about 13 <hi>d. per</hi> quarter for import,
and about one half of that for export, to
which is to be added one half <hi>per cent.</hi>
admiralty duty, or what we ſhould call
port charge. I have indeed recommended
the aboliſhing every charge, and am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
it is neceſſary ſo to do in this country,
where it cannot be denied but that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
and difficulties to which our traders
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0398000400:120"/>
are ſubject from the behaviour of cuſtom-houſe
officers, are ſuch ſevere checks on
trade, as ought to be aboliſhed, eſpecially
in a trade which conſiſts ſo much in coaſting
voyages. However, if the aboliſhing them
cannot be complied with, let us at leaſt
adopt the ſenſible mode of the Dutch, who
have fixed their duties at one regular ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard;
well knowing that if it was left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
on the market price, the trade
would even be ſubject to frauds, which can
ſo eaſily be practiſed by a few men, who
always have it in their power to make
whatever artificial price may ſuit them.</p>
               <p>As a yet ſtronger proof of the advantage
of a free corn trade, I can inform the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that the wiſdom of the corn laws of
the Dutch, which were founded on found
policy, has been confirmed to them by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience:
for, ſome years ago, when they
were under great apprehenſion of ſcarcity,
they laid an embargo on corn, but after
three months trial were obliged to open
their ports; nor have the States ſuffered it
to be attempted ſince, not even laſt year,
when the univerſal appearance of a dearth
in Germany might ſeem to require it, if
any thing could: the experience which
they had acquired by the former attempt,
convinced them of the folly of ſuch a ſtep;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0398000400:121"/>
for in conſequence of the embargo here
alluded to, they ſoon diſcovered they were
in danger of being deprived of that ſupply
which enabled them to be the warehouſe
keepers and carriers of all Europe. By this
wiſe regulation they have had the ſupplying
of France, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, nay
even Germany, by the way of the Rhine:
but what is very remarkable, and the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
proof of the advantage of free trade,
is, that Amſterdam, from a long habit of
carrying it on, enjoys it to its full extent,
notwithſtanding every natural diſadvantage
that can poſſibly attend a country. In proof
of what I now advance, I can inform the
reader of two remarkable inſtances; the
one is, that corn was ſhipped at Amſterdam
for France, but from an apprehenſion the
ſhip would not get time enough through the
Texel, the remainder of the quantity was
ſent by inland navigation at a conſiderable
expence to Rotterdam, to be ſhipped off
there; and the fact is, that the laſt ſhip was
returned again from the coaſt of France,
before the Amſterdam ſhip got out of the
Texel. The other inſtance, not leſs ſtriking,
and more pertinent to my preſent ſubject,
is, that the ſame houſe ſhipped a cargo
from Amſterdam and London at the ſame
time, both bound to Leghorn; the Engliſh
ſhip returned into the river, and the remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0398000400:122"/>
were made, before the Dutchman got
out of the Texel.</p>
               <p>The two abovementioned examples are, I
hope, ſufficient to prove the natural advantages
we have in point of ſituation; nor can I think
that people will be ſo blind as not to ſee the
great national advantage that would attend
ſuch an export of the natural growth of our
country. It is true, indeed, that according
to the information given by the ingenious
author of the Corn Tracts, the greateſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
ever exported here is too trifling to be
thought an object: but let it be remembered,
that all I mean to prove is, that this is entirely
owing to our trade's not being open, and
that we might naturally command the whole
of it; eſpecially ſince the diviſion of Poland,
the growth of which muſt now come through
Dantzick, which at preſent belongs to the
King of Pruſſia.</p>
               <p>Here I muſt inform thoſe who do not think
the corn trade can ever be a great object to
England, that the capital which is engaged
in it at Amſterdam is far beyond belief.
Let them judge of it when I tell them, that,
on an average, there are ſeldom leſs than
20,000 laſts, which make above 200,000
quarters, lying in their magazines. The value
of this quantity cannot be much leſs than
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0398000400:123"/>
400,000f ſterling. So conſiderable a ſum
as this lying always locked up in an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
trade, proves the advantage of it, and
demonſtrates that we need only create the
trade, to have the traders. I have before
obſerved, that the trade which is really bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
to a country muſt conſiſt in the expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of ſuch articles as are the produce of
that country: but, in contradiction to this
idea, it appears that a ſenſible policy has
rendered the moſt unnatural branch of trade
highly beneficial to Holland; for, without
a blade of corn growing in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
excepting a very ſmall quantity in
Zealand and Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Frieſland, the magazines
of Amſterdam have always a ſupply for
every port in Europe, brought in and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out through the moſt tedious and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
paſſage into the German Ocean, or
the Channel.</p>
               <p>The neceſſary reſult of what I have been
ſaying is, that if we, who are ſo well ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
to ſupply thoſe markets, were to adopt
the policy of the Dutch, we ſhould enjoy
their profits in a much higher degree than
they can with their bad navigation, and this
in addition to the great advantage of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
trade, which is that of exporting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
of our own country. Can there poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be a clearer demonſtration of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0398000400:124"/>
it would give to agriculture,
or do we want a ſtronger proof that we
ſhould always have plenty at home for our
own conſumption, when the people at Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,
who are obliged to purchaſe it,
have their magazines always full, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that the port is never ſhut?</p>
               <p>As what I have advanced on this head
may perhaps not be credited, but deemed
the phantom of a wild brain, let me intreat
the legiſlature to conſult that able and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
miniſter at the Hague, Sir Joſeph
Yorke. He can give indiſputable information
on this ſubject, information which may be
depended on; and upon his opinion I will
reſt mine.</p>

            <p>AFTER I had finiſhed the foregoing
Eſſay, the third edition of the Rev.
Doctor Price's <hi>Obſervations on Reverſionary
Payments, &amp;c.</hi> was ſent to me from town.
His deſervedly reſpectable character made
it neceſſary that I ſhould take particular
notice of what he ſays on monopolizing
farms and its conſequences. I am ſorry to
find myſelf under a neceſſity of differing
widely with him in my opinion on this
ſubject; and cannot help lamenting that a
gentleman of ſo much knowledge, and who
is ſo clear and demonſtrative in all that he
ſays on thoſe matters which come within
the ſphere of his real ſtudies, ſhould, ſo
inadvertently, enter into a popular error,
and join in the cry which has been art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
kept up to irritate and inflame the
minds of men.</p>
            <p>My expreſſions on this occaſion may
ſeem too ſtrong; but ſo ſenſible and candid
an antagoniſt requires to be very pointedly
refuted. I declare, that I highly revere
and eſteem his character, and am perſuaded
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0398000400:126"/>
that it was his very love of truth that has
led him out of the way: but at the ſame
time I hope this inſtance of his having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſignedly
promoted the preſent uneaſineſs
of a miſguided people, will be a caution to
him, in the future, to keep to ſuch ſubjects
as really come within the line of his
particular ſtudies; and that he will not ſo
readily give credit to reports propagated
by deſigning men, the circumſtances of
which he is not perfectly acquainted with;
for an opinion of ſo much weight as his,
is more dangerous than the declamations
of an hundred ſcribblers whom I have not
thought worthy of notice. This, I hope,
will be an apology for my pointing out to
him the true ſtate of the facts concerning
which he has been miſinformed.</p>
            <p>As to the authority of Mr. <hi>Muret,</hi> and
his reaſoning on the ſubject of great farms,
(quoted by Dr. Price, p. 373.) it has very
little weight with me: not that I mean to
doubt his veracity, for I believe he relates
and argues as he thinks; but ſpeculative
productions ſeldom carry conviction. If
the village that was converted into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſne,
was made a park or pleaſure ground,
I can ſuppoſe the fact; or if it was a neſt
of houſes thrown down and converted into
corn-fields, I will allow that it could not
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0398000400:127"/>
lodge ſo many inhabitants; or if it was a
number of ſmall farms taken up by ſome
rich man, who, though merely a ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
thought himſelf a farmer, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the produce to have been leſs; but if
it was put into the hands of an intelligent
huſbandman, I think I have ſhewn in the
foregoing pages, that the produce could
not but be greater. Our country abounds
with facts of this kind, and I hope their
number will increaſe.</p>
            <p>When it is done by landlords, to reduce
the repairs of cottages, I abhor the idea,
and have accordingly exploded it: but the
ſpeculations which the great farmer is able
to make, put it in his power to draw more
riches from the bowels of the earth, and
thereby he becomes a more uſeful member
of this great and powerful nation. Perhaps
Mr. Muret would have rejoiced to have
ſeen an inſtance of induſtry which I met
with in Flanders, a dozen men mattock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up a field of ſtubble to put in wheat:
but the man who knew the uſe and benefit
of the plough, lamented the loſt labour of
eleven of thoſe poor wretches, who might
have been employed more beneficially for
their country in manufactures, whilſt one
might cultivate with a plough as much land
as would ſupport the reſt. This would be a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0398000400:128"/>
public benefit, and not a calamity:—nor is
it a conſequence that there muſt be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation,
becauſe men are not ſeen waſting
their labour in the open field.</p>
            <p>In regard to the many calculations which
have appeared, and by which the depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of this country has been attempted
to be proved, I can ſay little; nor would it
become me to enter the liſts with the many
ingenious men who have made that a part
of their ſtudies; but I ſhall not ſcruple to
ſay, that the <hi>data</hi> on which theſe calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
are made are, in my opinion, too
ſlight to eſtabliſh certain conſequences. For
example, the reſidence in London of thoſe
who are deemed its inhabitants is by no
means regular, and the number who come
from different parts to London and its envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
within the bills of mortality, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in their laſt ſtage, muſt ſwell the liſt
of deaths. On the other hand, as the liſt
of births is only taken from the chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
the number of born muſt be much
greater, as neither the Diſſenters nor the
Quakers are chriſtened in our churches;
thus the whole is erroneous. Again, when
we conſider the number of great manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing
towns which have ariſen within
this century, and ſee every where not only
an increaſe of culture, but alſo that it is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0398000400:129"/>
carried on in a much more ſpirited manner
than formerly, (circumſtances which muſt
neceſſarily employ a greater number of
hands) I cannot ſee on what foundation
we can determine the number of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
to be leſs. As to forming the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
from the number of houſes, ſo far
as my obſervation has extended, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be done: but if any medium is to be
taken, I ſhould rather fix it at ſix perſons
in a houſe, which would make our whole
number amount to about ſix millions. But
when we conſider the numbers of poor that
inhabit one houſe in manufacturing towns
and great cities, nay even in country vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,
there can be no doubt but that ſix
millions is far under the mark. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
neither of theſe doctrines can have
any relation to the ſcarcity of corn, which,
in reality, is ſcarce or not ſcarce in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the conſumption of it. If there are
more mouths, there will be more corn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there will be more hands to till the
earth; and if there is more corn, there
will be more mouths, becauſe plenty will
bring people; and thus, by this happy
connection and dependance one on the
other, I am pleaſed to think the world will
go on as it has hitherto continued to do.
If any of the ingenious literary world
agree with me in opinion, I hope to ſee
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0398000400:130"/>
ſome of their productions calculated to eaſe
the minds of men, by convincing them that
induſtry and chearful ſobriety are the only
requiſites to acquire that happineſs, which
deſpondency, with a diſpoſition of exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt the times, precludes them from.</p>
            <p>Dr. Price's diſtinctions (p. 379, 380)
between the wild and the civilized ſtate are
well drawn, and his obſervations on them
are very juſt: but when he knows that the
natural progreſſion from an infant colony to
a powerful and free nation is always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with a proportionate degree of lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury,
why does he lament in print what the
art and power of man cannot prevent? It
is a theſis for a ſchool, but ſhould not have
flowed from the Doctor's pen.</p>
            <p>I perfectly agree with Dr. Price (p. 381)
in his opinion of the fatal conſequences that
have attended the accumulation of property
in this kingdom, and moſt ſincerely regret
the loſs of that ſet of men who were called
yeomen: but let not the accumulation of
property be blended with the renting of
large farms; its tendency is juſt the reverſe.</p>
            <p>By the quotation (p. 381) from Suſmilch,
one would imagine it was propoſed to adopt
the law of Licinius and Romulus. That po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0398000400:131"/>
of the then Romans was wiſe; it was
when they were a ſmall ſtate, and confined
by their enemies to a ſmall extent of
country: it was then neceſſary that the
little quantity of land on which they were
to depend for ſubſiſtance ſhould be portioned
out in ſmall parcels, in order that each family
might have ſufficient to maintain itſelf; for
then it was not a diſgrace to handle the
plough or the ſpade, though the very men
who did it were to be called out to command
their armies. In a nation like the Romans,
not depending on its manufactures and
commerce, and whoſe only care is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
corn for itſelf, perhaps Mr. Muret's
obſervations, and Licinius's law, may be
the beſt inſtitution. Upon this principle
too it was that the Spartans did not aim at
raiſing more corn, though by the hands
of their ſlaves, than was neceſſary to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a warlike people. But to adopt ſuch a
ſyſtem in a commercial nation, whoſe very
commerce depends upon agricultur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, is by
no means of a piece with the Doctor's ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
on other ſubjects; for ſuppoſing
the farmers reſtricted to ſeven <hi>jugera,</hi> or
five acres, what could be the produce? The
land would be too little for a plough, and too
much for the ſpade, as hath been ſhewn in
p. 3 to 14 of the foregoing ſheets, where the
beneficial ſize of a farm is explained; and in
p. 83, the Doctor will be pleaſed to obſerve,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0398000400:132"/>
that equal care was taken to provide the
ſeven and the two <hi>jugera</hi> for the cottagers,
who, though not farmers, are, when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of in their proper ſphere, equally
neceſſary and beneficial to a ſtate, as there
will be a greater increaſe of produce by their
joint labours in one farm, than when each
is to toil for himſelf on a little ſpot better
calculated for the labour of his wife and
children. The certain weekly income of
the huſband's labour, not attended with
the anxiety of the little farmer, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
more real comfort in his little cottage,
and therefore will be more likely to promote
population. As to the ſuppoſed advantages of
the commons, and the means of the cottager's
procuring ſubſiſtence from them, that matter
is fully explained in p. 83 and 84; and if by
converting the little farmers into a body of
men who muſt work for others more labour
is produced, it is an advantage which the
nation ſhould wiſh for: the compulſion
will be that of honeſt induſtry to provide
for a family, which by that means is leſs
liable to become a burden to the pariſh,
than that of the little farmer, whoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
being attended with conſtant anxiety
and diſtreſs, ſeldom proſper.</p>
            <p>I agree with Dr. Price that more bread
will be conſumed, and therefore that more
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0398000400:133"/>
corn will be grown: but that will be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
a benefit to the nation; for it will be
by the aſſiſtance of the cottager and his
family who are employed in the culture of
the land, inſtead of loitering away their
time in tending a few ſtarved ſheep on the
commons, and cutting furzes. It will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
him to go to market to purchaſe what
food he pleaſes, and by the produce being
greater when their joint labours are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
on one farm, there will be a ſurplus
for manufacturers, and by this means manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
one of the mines of this nation,
will increaſe, in proportion to the quantity
of corn produced; but wherever numbers
of men are employed, there will be among
them idle and debauched, who, thanks to
the poors' laws as they now ſtand, will load
the pariſh, though not real objects of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>This is the way in which the renting of
large and moderate-ſized tracts operates,
(ſee p. 3 to 14), and this is the way by which
this country has for many years paſt been
becoming the moſt powerful in Europe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall grant with Dr. Price, (p. 383) that
what has been ſuggeſted will promote til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage;
but how it is to account for the fact
which he immediately alludes to in 1697,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0398000400:134"/>
namely, that when wheat was at 3<hi>l.</hi> and
exportation went on, and yet that there was
no clamour, I know not; unleſs it proves
that the exportation of corn, which then
firſt took place in conſequence of the wiſe
law that was paſſed in 1689 for granting a
bounty, inſpired the Poor with induſtry,
which kept their minds peaceable and ſober;
whereas there now prevails among the
lower claſs of people a licentiouſneſs which
has been, in a great meaſure, occaſioned by
the numberleſs publications on the cauſes of
ſcarcity, too evidently calculated to inflame
their minds.</p>
            <p>Dr. Price attributes the abovementioned
patience in the Poor to the then cheapneſs of
other food. I allow that this might natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
enough have been the conſequence,
had the fact been ſo: but, from the beſt
authority I can procure, which is the account
of the prices of beef as contracted for from
time to time by the Victualling-Office, it
appears, that in 1697, the time alluded to,
the commiſſioners of that office contracted
at 25<hi>s. per C. wt.</hi> which is nearly the ſame
they do now; but what is more remarkable,
is, that the average of the five preceding
and five following years was only 23<hi>s.</hi> 1<hi>d.
per C. wt.</hi> and in 1697, Pork was at 31<hi>s.
per C. wt.</hi> However, this was undoubtedly
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0398000400:135"/>
cheaper in proportion than bread: but it
was a natural conſequence, for agriculture
at that time, I mean the plough, was but in
its infancy; herds and paſture ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed;
and from the uncertainty which the
people had been accuſtomed to in the great
variation of the price of corn, it is no
wonder they were in the habit of living
more on meat, which had ever been plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as herds and flocks had been their
riches; and as little ſurprizing is it that
they, in 1697, ſtill continued in the uſe of
meat for their chief ſupport. The very
fame cuſtom ſtill prevails in the iſlands and
all along the North-Weſt coaſt of Scotland.</p>
            <p>In regard to the Doctor's obſervation on the
great difference there was in the price of
meat and corn during the laſt century, when
he acknowledges that corn was dearer than
it has been at an average for theſe laſt 40
years, but that meat was about half its
preſent price; it only proves, that his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
can have no reference to the preſent
times, and that that great difference in the
price of meat and corn was occaſioned by
this country's having been, during almoſt
the whole century, diſtracted by civil wars,
which muſt be a check to the plough, and
encourage herds and flocks, the only move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
riches of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0398000400:136"/>
The Doctor ſays, that beef and pork were
ſold at 2½  and three pounds for a penny at
the ſame time that wheat was ſold at 7<hi>s.</hi> and
8<hi>s.</hi> per quarter, and that bore the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the price of corn as it would bear
now were this at about 4<hi>l.</hi> per quarter. This
aſſertion muſt certainly be intended to prove,
that either corn is too cheap, or meat too
dear; but, in my opinion, it proves neither;
for every commodity will bear a value in
proportion to its plenty and the demand for
it. It is inconteſtably proved in hiſtory,
that the plenty of meat was in proportion to
the ſcarcity of corn; conſequently the price
muſt vary in the ſame proportion; but when
a demand for each is equal, and the plenty
of each is the ſame, the value of the one
muſt fall, or that of the other riſe, till they
come on a par, and that value will always
be according to the value of money: if
therefore the price of corn is nearly what
it ought to be, which can only be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by the proportion that the value of
land bears to the value of money, it is as
evident, that meat ought to riſe in the ſame
proportion: but the only method of aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
what ſhould be the price of the one
for it to be in proportion to that of the
other, is to allot a certain ſum of money to
the raiſing of corn, and an equal ſum to the
rearing and fattening of cattle; an equal
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0398000400:137"/>
profit will determine the real value of each.
If this was done, I am pretty certain it
would appear that the preſent prices are
nearly equal, and that meat has not riſen
in too great proportion; nor will it be
found, if we conſider the value of money
and of land, that proviſions are greatly
above what they ought to be. Indeed this
is pretty clearly demonſtrated by the Doctor's
own tables: I call them his, becauſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find the corn-tables carried down lower
than 1766 on any other authority than his;
he extends them to 1772, and makes the
average from 1766 to 1772, 2<hi>l.</hi> 6<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi>
This is evidently higher than the preceding
average; though not ſo much as I ſhould
have expected. However, this difference
is clearly accounted for by a very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
circumſtance, which is, that it is the
exact period during which this country has
had ſucceſſive bad crops. It likewiſe ſhews,
that ſcarcity is the real, as it is the natural
cauſe of the preſent high prices, and that
theſe are therefore not to be attributed to the
various cauſes which ſome have as wickedly,
as others have ignorantly, pretended to
point out. Whichever of theſe may have
been the motive, both of them are fraught
with the ſame evil tendency of ſtirring up
riot and confuſion. That the prices are too
high for the Poor at this moment, I confeſs;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0398000400:138"/>
and the cauſe of their being ſo is evident;
it proceeds from the general calamity that
has attended trade during this laſt year; a
calamity which has occaſioned a general
conſternation among all ranks of people.
The general diffidence that now prevails,
and the doubt which the merchant has of
not receiving his remittances, makes him
cautious in giving freſh orders, and tardy in
his payments to the manufacturer: the
manufacturer muſt, in conſequence of this,
in the ſame manner treat thoſe from whom
he purchaſes his materials, and ceaſe to
employ ſo many hands as before. By this
chain of circumſtances, the hardſhip muſt
ultimately fall upon the labourer dependant
on ſuch manufactures, who, though he
could afford to maintain himſelf and family
well at the wages he now earns, if he was
in conſtant employ, muſt certainly feel the
weight of the preſent prices of neceſſaries,
which are on this account, and on this only,
too high. What I have ſaid of the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturer,
may equally hold good with regard
to the common labourer; for undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
the late ſcanty harveſt has deprived
many threſhers of their winter's work, and
I can believe that many hands which before
found employment in ſupplying the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and pleaſures of life, both in town and
country, may, in conſequence of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0398000400:139"/>
that has ſeized every one, now
want work: but this is a momentary evil.</p>
            <p>I cannot quit this ſubject without pointing
out one glaring fault: it is, that the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
which has occaſioned this clamour
does not arrive at the price when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
is allowed with bounty; and
it muſt be ſuppoſed that the bounty's
being fixed at any price, muſt imply that
ſuch price ſhould be under the general
average of the whole country; whereas
Dr. Price's elucidation of this matter clearly
demonſtrates, that the opening or ſhutting
of the port, and the giving or taking off
the bounty, depend ſolely on the artificial
price of Bear-key. There cannot be a clearer
proof than this, that reſtrictions in any trade
muſt ever ſubject the Legiſlature to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by interſted deſigning men: it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
proves, that reſtrictions naturally
create the very monopoly which they are
meant to guard againſt; and thus ſhews
the abſolute neceſſity of a perfect freedom
in trade in general, but moſt eſpecially in
that of corn.</p>
            <p>In regard to what the Doctor ſays (page
388) on the incloſures of the common-fields
in Leiceſterſhire, from whence he
concludes that the increaſe of tillage there is
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0398000400:140"/>
at an end, I ſhall briefly obſerve, that it
greatly ſurprized me, as being diametrically
contrary to every day's experience. I make
no doubt but that the Doctor had that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
but I would adviſe a cautious
inquiry into the validity of the authority,
before he, whoſe character as an author is
in ſuch high repute, ventures to aſſert ſo
palpable an abſurdity: but granting the
fact, the only obſervation I can make upon
it is, that the land is in very unſkilful
hands. In regard to Northamptonſhire
incloſure, I can ſpeak with ſome degree of
knowledge, and notwithſtanding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
of the ſenſible author alluded to, I
know farmers who have chearfully ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to have their rents doubled on the
incloſure of the common-field land, though
intended to be kept under the plough,
ſaying, that they muſt now become better
farmers, and not continue ſuch ſlovens.
That laying down many of theſe incloſures
to graſs has prevailed, I ſhall not diſallow,
and ſuch tracts muſt conſequently bear the
face of depopulation: however, the men
are not loſt, but perhaps, with the ground,
better employed; not but that, as an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual,
I ſhould, upon my own eſtate, lay
a certain reſtriction in the allotment of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
and arable; but how far commiſſioners
ought to be intruſted with ſuch a charge, I
ſhall not preſume to ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0398000400:141"/>
With regard to the quotation from Lord
Bacon, it is not applicable to the preſent
times, and I think I have ſufficiently
expoſed, in the foregoing ſheets, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity
of owners holding the plough
themſelves, at a time when corn is, or
ought to be, eſteemed part of the trade
and wealth of this great nation. Dr. Price's
farther quotations (page 391 and 392 of
this work) are fully anſwered by the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of the times. Herds and cattle were
formerly the only riches, and the free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of wool occaſioned thoſe mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies
of land and ſheep which were found
to be of evil tendency: a few men could
tend great numbers, and the reſt of the
ruſtic tribe were unemployed; for, by the
exportation of the raw wool, there could be
no woollen manufactories. On this account
it was, that in 1537, flocks were ſtinted
to 2000, and tenements were to be erected
on a given number of acres: but yet were
people ſo averſe to agriculture, that it was
neceſſary to ſet a fine on laying down arable
ground to paſture. In thoſe days agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I mean the plough, was eſteemed of
ſuch conſequence to the nation, that it had
not only every encouragement, but was
even inforced; whereas now that it has
arrived to a degree of perfection, it is the
faſhion of the times to be jealous of its
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0398000400:142"/>
proſperity, and to load it with every incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance;
in ſhort, all the acts which paſſed,
and are here alluded to, were intended only
to people a country laid waſte and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated
by civil wars: but ſuch reſtrictions
now would be altogether abſurd. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Doctor's obſervations in page
393, I ſhall ſay, that every one was culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
for his own wants, as our author
juſtly obſerves is now the caſe in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
parts of America: but I am happy to
think that in theſe days this nation will
vye with Holland to ſupply all Europe
with corn, either directly, or through the
bowels of our manufacturers. As to the
proportion of the price of labour, it can
bear no compariſon; for if no labour was
wanted, there could be no price; nor is a
compariſon to be drawn with the preſent
time, when, owing to ſucceſſive bad crops,
corn has riſen a little. But it may not be
unworthy of notice, that in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the price of labour's not being
increaſed in the proportion of the price of
proviſions, the Doctor's aſſertion corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
what is ſaid in the valuable works of
Mr. Arthur Young, and will, I hope, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify
the minds of thoſe who imagine that
the dearneſs of proviſions muſt ruin our
manufactures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0398000400:143"/>
As to the circumſtance (page 394 of Dr.
Price) of the ranks of men being altered,
I agree and lament the fact with the Doctor:
but perhaps we do not mean the ſame claſs
of men. I moſt truly lament the loſs of
our yeomenry, that ſet of men who really
kept up the independance of this nation;
and ſorry I am to ſee their lands now in
the hands of monopolizing Lords, tenanted
out to ſmall farmers, who hold their leaſes
on ſuch conditions as to be little better than
vaſſals ready to attend a ſummons on every
miſchievous occaſion.</p>
            <p>With regard to the claſs called Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
I believe they are moſtly in the
ſame ſtate as they were, with the benefit of
work at preſent, inſtead of being prowling
about commons and waſtes; and as to the
luxury which the Doctor talks of, it has
been and ever will be an attendant on a
wealthy free people, and, with the riches,
diffuſes itſelf through all ranks of people;
it is one of thoſe evils which cannot be
avoided, and therefore is needleſs to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>It is true that the lower people pay their
proportion of the taxes, that is to ſay, of
thoſe taxes which are levied by affize, for
then they fall always on the conſumer:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0398000400:144"/>
for example, the currier who pays the tax,
charges it to the ſhoemaker, and the ſhoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker
lays it on the labourer, who, deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in an article that is not aſſizeable (his
labour) cannot raiſe the price of it to the
farmer; therefore the tax falls on him:
but though it may not appear viſible to
every eye, I will maintain, that an equal
proportion of it falls on the wealthy; for
the rich man, who ſpends the whole of his
income, by conſuming a greater quantity
of aſſizeable commodities, pays his juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the tax.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe true, that the lower people
fight the battles of a nation: but, as Sir
James Stewart rightly ſays, it is from the
free hands, the manufacturers and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
that our armies are recruited, and not
from the cottager and ſmall farmer that
ſuch drafts are, or ought to be made.</p>
            <p>The reaſoning of the author of <hi>The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry</hi>
concerning the compariſon which
ought to be made between the prices of
corn ſince the bounty, and during the reign
of James I. cannot be juſt, becauſe they
are founded either on falſe or imperfect
facts: he thinks the latter period ſhould be
taken, becauſe it was peaceable, commerce
increaſed, and all the influence which the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0398000400:145"/>
riches of America could produce on the
prices of corn and proviſions had taken
place: but the reign of Charles I. except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the years 1642, 3, 4, and 5, (the prices
of which do not come into his account)
ought for the ſame reaſons to be taken:
they alſo were peaceable, and commerce
had increaſed. The average of theſe two
periods ſhould therefore be taken, and in
that caſe the foundation of our author's
reaſoning falls to the ground. But in the
conduct of it he contradicts himſelf: under
the reign of James I. he ſays, <hi>the influence
of American money had taken full effect;</hi>
under that of Charles I. <hi>that the great plenty
of money had riſen the price of ſuperior pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions;</hi>
conſequently the increaſe of money
had <hi>not</hi> taken its full effect. But whether
the reign of Charles or James ſhould be
taken is not eſſential, ſince, in juſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we ſhould take neither; for no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
can be made between periods in
which the <hi>intereſt</hi> and conſequently the
<hi>quantity</hi> of money is ſo extremely different,
being more than 50 <hi>per cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Enquiry</hi> (p. 93) ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the bounty, ſays, employing ſo large
a proportion of our cultivated lands muſt
ſtraiten the means of raiſing every other
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0398000400:146"/>
kind of proviſion to ſuch a degree that the
utmoſt exertion of the Poor cannot reach
them, and the people muſt be obliged either
to deſert the country, or enhance the price
of labour.</p>
            <p>Upon this I ſhall obſerve, that the moſt
material fact in the whole Enquiry is againſt
him; I mean, the fall in the price of corn
ſince the bounty was given, a fall which every
one of his tables ſufficiently proves, and of
which we ſee the conſequence in the people's
not having deſerted their country: on the
contrary, we have received great acceſſions
from every quarter of the globe; and as to
the riſe in the price of labour, it has riſen
all over Europe, as well as in England, and
ought to riſe, as well as all commodities,
with the increaſe of money.</p>
            <p>But as our author attempts to enforce the
reſult of his tables by an eſtimate drawn up
of the farmer's expences, produce, and
profit on 10 acres, which he would prove
to amount to 68 <hi>per cent. per ann.</hi> for
four ſucceſſive years; he will permit me to
ſet him right, in ſome eſſential points,
which can only be done by ſtating a true
account of the expences and product of
ſuch a courſe as he lays down.

By the above eſtimate, which I believe
neareſt the truth, it will appear, that the
farmer may clear about 12 <hi>per cent. per ann.</hi>
in four years: but from this ſhould be
deducted the intereſt of his money for the
greateſt part of the expences of the
wheat crop, which was expended the firſt
year; and I will venture to ſay, that with
ſuch an execrable courſe of huſbandry, it
is full as much as any farmer makes: but
this does no more than prove that very
little dependence is to be made on ſuch
calculations. All that is meant by this
refutation, is only to expoſe the fallacy of
ſuch calculations, from whence ſuch falſe
arguments are deduced. Whether done by
deſign, or through ignorance, they have
the ſame miſchievous effect of inflaming
the minds of men; and as the whole of
this author's arguments depends on ſuch
falſe principles, I ſhall not think his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
obſervations worthy my notice, but
conclude with a hint to thoſe who are biaſſed
by his reaſoning, to enquire carefully into
the truth of the facts which ſerve him for
the baſis of his arguments.</p>
