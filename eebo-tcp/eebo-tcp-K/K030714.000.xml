            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to inquire into the Object, Principles, and Method of Demonſtration admitted by the Mathematicians of the preſent Age, with the ſame freedom that you preſume to treat the Principles and Myſteries of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; to the end, that all Men may ſee what right you have to lead, or what En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement others have to follow you.

               <p>III. The Method of Fluxions is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Key, by help whereof the modern Mathematicians unlock the ſecrets of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, and conſequently of Nature. And as it is that which hath enabled them ſo remarkably to outgo the Ancients in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering Theorems and ſolving Problems, the exerciſe and application thereof is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the main, if not ſole, employment of all thoſe who in this Age paſs for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Geometers. But whether this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod be clear or obſcure, conſiſtent or repugnant, demonſtrative or precarious, as I ſhall inquire with the utmoſt impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, ſo I ſubmit my inquiry to your own Judgment, and that of every candid Reader. Lines are ſuppoſed to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated <note n="*" place="bottom">Introd. ad Quadraturam Curvarum.</note> by the motion of Points, Plains by the motion of Lines, and Solids by the motion of Plains. And whereas Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities generated in equal times are greater or leſſer, according to the greater or leſſer Velocity, wherewith they increaſe and are generated, a Method hath been found to determine Quantities from the Velocities of their generating Motions.

Your Theorems therefore cannot be accurately true, nor your Problems accurately ſolved, in virtue of Premiſes,

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0323000200:45"/>
Equation being ſubducted there remains <hi>z</hi> = 2<hi>xv</hi> + <hi>vv.</hi> And by reaſon of ſimilar Triangles <hi>PS</hi> ∶ <hi>PR</hi> ∷ <hi>NR</hi> ∶ <hi>NM, i. e. z</hi> ∶ <hi>v</hi> ∷ <hi>y</hi> ∶ <hi>s</hi> = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, wherein if for <hi>y</hi> and <hi>z</hi> we ſubſtitute their values, we get <gap reason="math">

                  </gap> = <hi>s</hi> = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And ſuppoſing <hi>NO</hi> to be infinitely diminiſhed, the ſubſecant <hi>NM</hi> will in that caſe coincide with the ſubtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>NL,</hi> and <hi>v</hi> as an Infiniteſimal may be rejected, whence it follows that <hi>S</hi> = <hi>NL</hi> = <gap reason="math">

                  </gap>; which is the true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the Subtangent. And ſince this was obtained by one only error, <hi>i. e.</hi> by once rejecting one only Infiniteſimal, it ſhould ſeem, contrary to what hath been ſaid, that an infiniteſimal Quantity or Difference may be neglected or thrown away, and the Concluſion nevertheleſs be accurately true, although there was no double miſtake or rectifying of one error by another, as in the firſt Caſe. But if this Point be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, we ſhall find there is even here a double miſtake, and that one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſates or rectifies the other. For in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0323000200:46"/>
firſt place, it was ſuppoſed, that when <hi>NO</hi> is infinitely diminiſhed or becomes an Infiniteſimal, then the Subſecant <hi>NM</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes equal to the Subtangent <hi>NL.</hi> But this is a plain miſtake, for it is evident, that as a Secant cannot be a Tangent, ſo a Subſecant cannot be a Subtangent. Be the Difference ever ſo ſmall, yet ſtill there is a Difference.

Therefore <hi>o</hi> cannot be thrown out as an Infiniteſimal, or upon the Principle that Infiniteſimals may be ſafely neglected.

Therefore, be the Power what you pleaſe, there will ariſe on one Side an algebraical Expreſſion, on the other a geometrical Quantity, each of which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally divides it ſelf into three Members: The algebraical or fluxionary Expreſſion, into one which includes neither the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0323000200:55"/>
of the Increment of the Abſciſs nor of any Power thereof, another which includes the Expreſſion of the Increment it ſelf, and a third including the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Powers of the Increment. The geometrical Quantity alſo or whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed Area conſiſts of three Parts or Members, the firſt of which is the given Area, the ſecond a Rectangle under the Ordinate and the Increment of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciſs, and the third a curvilinear Space. And, comparing the homologous or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent Members on both Sides, we find that as the firſt Member of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is the Expreſſion of the given Area, ſo the ſecond Member of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion will expreſs the Rectangle or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Member of the geometrical Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and the third, containing the Powers of the Increment, will expreſs the curvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linear Space, or third Member of the geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Quantity. This hint may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be further extended and applied to good purpoſe, by thoſe who have leiſure and curioſity for ſuch Matters. The uſe I make of it is to ſhew, that the Analyſis cannot obtain in Augments or Differences,

It ſeems therefore upon the whole that we may ſafely pronounce, the Concluſion cannot be right, if in order thereto any Quantity be made to vaniſh, or be neglected, except that either one Error is redreſſed by another; or that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, on the ſame Side of an Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion equal Quantities are deſtroyed by contrary Signs, ſo that the Quantity we mean to reject is firſt annihilated; or laſtly, that from the oppoſite Sides equal Quantities are ſubducted. And therefore to get rid of Quantities by the received Principles of Fluxions or of Differences is neither good Geometry nor good Logic. When the Augments vaniſh, the Veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties alſo vaniſh. The Velocities or Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſaid to be <hi>primò</hi> and <hi>ultimò,</hi> as the Augments naſcent and evaneſcent. Take therefore the <hi>Ratio</hi> of the evaneſcent Quantities, it is the ſame with that of the Fluxions. It will therefore anſwer all Intents as well. Why then are Fluxions
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0323000200:57"/>
introduced? Is it not to ſhun or rather to palliate the Uſe of Quantities infinitely ſmall? But we have no Notion whereby to conceive and meaſure various Degrees of Velocity, beſide Space and Time, or when the Times are given, beſide Space alone. We have even no Notion of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity preſcinded from Time and Space. When therefore a Point is ſuppoſed to move in given Times, we have no Notion of greater or leſſer Velocities or of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions between Velocities, but only of longer or ſhorter Lines, and of Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons between ſuch Lines generated in equal Parts of Time.</p>

And if the Velocities of naſcent and evaneſcent Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, <hi>i. e.</hi> abſtracted from Time and Space, may not be comprehended, how can we comprehend and demonſtrate their

               <p>XLIX. Although momentaneous Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, naſcent and evaneſcent Quantities, Fluxions and Infiniteſimals of all Degrees, are in truth ſuch ſhadowy Entities, ſo difficult to imagine or conceive diſtinctly, that (to ſay the leaſt) they cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as Principles or Objects of clear and accurate Science: and although this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity and incomprehenſibility of your Metaphyſics had been alone ſufficient, to allay your Pretenſions to Evidence; yet it hath, if I miſtake not, been further ſhewn, that your Inferences are no more juſt than your Conceptions are clear, and that your Logics are as exceptionable as your Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſics. It ſhould ſeem therefore upon the whole, that your Concluſions are not attained by juſt Reaſoning from clear Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; conſequently that the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of modern Analyſts, however uſeful in mathematical Calculations, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, doth not habituate and qualify the Mind to apprehend clearly and infer juſtly; and conſequently, that you have no right in Virtue of ſuch Habits, to dictate out of your proper Sphere, beyond which

your Judgment is to paſs for no more than that of other Men.</p>

               <p>L. Of a long time I have ſuſpected, that theſe modern Analytics were not ſcientifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and gave ſome Hints thereof to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic about twenty five Years ago. Since which time, I have been diverted by other Occupations, and imagined I might em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my ſelf better than in deducing and laying together my Thoughts on ſo nice a Subject. And though of late I have been called upon to make good my Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet as the Perſon, who made this Call, doth not appear to think maturely enough to underſtand, either thoſe Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſics which he would refute, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics which he would patronize, I ſhould have ſpared my ſelf the trouble of writing for his Conviction. Nor ſhould I now have troubled you or my ſelf with this Addreſs, after ſo long an Intermiſſion of theſe Studies; were it not to prevent, ſo far as I am able, your impoſing on your ſelf and others in Matters of much higher Moment and Concern.

                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 10. Whether in Geometry it may not ſuffice to conſider aſſignable finite Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, without concerning our ſelves with Infinity? And whether it would not be righter to meaſure large Polygons having finite Sides, inſtead of Curves, than to ſuppoſe Curves are Polygons of infiniteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Sides, a Suppoſition neither true nor conceivable?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 11. Whether many Points, which are not readily aſſented to, are not never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs true? And whether thoſe in the two following Queries may not be of that Number?</p>

Whether the conſidering Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Diagrams abſolutely or in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, rather than as Repreſentatives of all aſſignable Magnitudes or Figures of the ſame kind, be not a principal Cauſe of the ſuppoſing finite Extenſion infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 18.

When it is ſaid or implied, that ſuch a certain Line delineated on Paper contains more than any aſſignable number of Parts, whether any more in truth ought to be underſtood, than that it is a Sign indifferently repreſenting all finite Lines, be they ever ſo great.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0323000200:88"/>
do not ſuppoſe and imply, either general abſtract Ideas or abſolute external Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be the Object of Geometry? And, therefore, whether, along with thoſe Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, ſuch Arguments alſo do not ceaſe and vaniſh?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 21. Whether the ſuppoſed infinite Diviſibility of finite Extenſion hath not been a Snare to Mathematicians, and a Thorn in their Sides? And whether a Quantity infinitely diminiſhed and a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity infinitely ſmall are not the ſame thing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 22. Whether it be neceſſary to conſider Velocities of naſcent or eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſcent Quantities, or Moments, or Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteſimals?

And whether Expreſſions in Lines or Species can be uſeful but ſo far forth as they are reducible to Numbers?</p>
               <p>25. Whether the finding out proper Expreſſions or Notations of Quantity be not the moſt general Character and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the Mathematics? And Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Operation that which limits and defines their Uſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 26. Whether Mathematicians have ſufficiently conſidered the Analogy and Uſe of Signs? And how far the ſpecific limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nature of things correſponds thereto?</p>

full liberty to make a Character denote, either a poſitive or a negative Quantity, or nothing at all, we may therefore in a geometrical Caſe, limited by Hypotheſes and Reaſonings from particular Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Relations of Figures, claim the ſame Licence?</p>
