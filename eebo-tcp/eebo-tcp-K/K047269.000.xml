            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Certainly—we'll have the wedding to-night. The young couple are ſo much in love, they will be glad to diſpenſe with ceremony— it really looks as if Heaven had a hand in this match, for if young Felix had not died ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly at Salamanca, we could never have been brothers-in-law.</p>

                  <p>As well as any hogſhead in my cellar—I have kept a tavern three years at Salamanca, and he was my conſtant cuſtomer. I knew his ſiſter too, a brave mettled damſel, that made no more of clapping on a pair of breeches, and ſtraddling a horſe-back, than if ſhe had never been laced in ſtays, or encumber'd with a petticoat.</p>

                  <p>Sir, he is the noble Don Felix de Silva,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1140502300:6"/>
of Salamanca, who waits below to have the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme felicity of kiſſing your honour's hand, and has ſent me before to make his compliments to you.
<stage>(To the Maid.)</stage>
Well, my dear, have you thought of the propoſal? Do you think me ſhocking?</p>

                  <p>Sir, if you are curious to know par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars about me, I am Lazarillo, of Valencia, as honeſt a little fellow, though I ſay it, that ſhould not ſay it, as ever rode before a port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manteau.
<stage>(To the Maid.)</stage>
What I pride myſelf for, more than any other good qualities, is, that I am the adorer, and faithful ſlave of your divine and inſurmountable beauty.</p>

                  <speaker>Lazar.</speaker>
                  <p>This is ſtrange news. It muſt be a very ſudden death—perhaps it was only his ghoſt that hired me, but I never ſaw any thing ſo like a living creature; he gave me a rap over the ſhoulders juſt now, that I thought felt very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. If he is really a ghoſt, he won't dare to pretend he's alive, and tell a lie before ſo much good company.

In my opinion, no Paradiſe can be ſuperior to it.

                  <p>This evening! why your honour has had no time to refreſh yourſelf. Our roads of late are none of the ſafeſt after ſunſet. Why, Sir, not above a week ago, a calaſh of mine with a young cavalier and his new married bride, were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked on the road by ſix of the moſt deſperate banditti that ever cried <hi>ſtand</hi> to a traveller.</p>

                  <speaker>Bora.</speaker>
                  <p>Too true, Sir. Two of my beſt mules were ſhot dead at the firſt diſcharge of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines; they wounded the gentleman, ſtunn'd my drivers, and rifled the poor young lady in a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible manner. In truth, your honour had better not think of venturing till morning, when you have the day fairly before you.</p>

deſired me to aſk for his maſter's letters, and keep them for him; one of them belongs to him, but which I don't know, for to tell you the truth, Sir, my parents found I had ſuch fine natural parts, they would not throw away money in having me taught any thing, ſo reading was left out among ſome other little accompliſhments in my educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>Don't fear me. You have relieved me from ſuch anxiety by your friendly confidence, that I would rather die than betray you; nay, what is ſtill more, I would rather loſe my lover.</p>

                  <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
                  <p>No. Pray indulge me; a ſecret burns in a ſingle breaſt; it is juſt poſſible that two may keep it, but if 'tis known to a third, I might as well tell it to the Cryer, and have it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed at the Great Door of every Church in Granada.</p>

                  <p>Well, you ſhall be obey'd; depend upon it I will be faithful to you. Men give themſelves ſtrange airs about our ſex: we are ſo unaccuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed, they ſay, to be truſted, that our vanity of a confidence ſhews we are unworthy of it.</p>

                  <p>No matter what they ſay; I think half of their ſuperiority lies in their beards and their doublets.

                  <p>It will never do. Mind, I don't find fault with the things, the things are good enough, very good, but half the merit of a ſervice conſiſts in the manner in which you put it on the table. Pig and ham at the ſame ſide! Why you might as well put a Hebrew Jew into the ſame ſtall at church with the Grand Inquiſitor. Mind me, do but mind me, ſee now, ſuppoſe this floor was the table.
