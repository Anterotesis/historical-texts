            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>As I have attempted to write a Comedy at the flattering inſtigation of your Lordſhip, the following ſcenes have a natural claim to your protection. If, when you prompted and encouraged me to court the Comic Muſe, you had imparted to me at the ſame time ſome ſhare of your inſtinctive penetration into character— of your elegant, but impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ridicule of faſhionable levities—had you conſigned to my hand the clue that guides you in the chace and detection of folly through the intricate windings of her labyrinth, I ſhould have preſented to you a Comedy more worthy of your attention. Such as it is, it offers me an opportunity of publickly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the high value I ſet upon a friendſhip, which I have had the happineſs of enjoying ſo many years.</p>

                  <p>Lord Melcourt, I know, is walked out; I was juſt enquiring after him. But to return to the ſubject;—Yeſterday evening, the family coach, covered with duſt, and much damaged by the toil and length of the journey, waddled up to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0304800700:10"/>the hall-door in great labour, and was happily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of Sir Pepper Plinlimmon, Lady Plinlim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Miſs Plinlimmon, and a <hi>femme de chambre;</hi> two ſervants attended on Welch ponies. The coach, I muſt inform you, contained originally five perſons, but it miſcarried on the road of Mr. Taffey, their chaplain, who could not bear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of a carriage. He is, however, expected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, in the baſket of ſome ſtage-coach.</p>

                  <p>I fancy we ſhall be able to do without Mr. Taffey.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Faſh.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed you are miſtaken. He is one of the eſſential perſonages in our drama, for he is to join the hands of Lord Melcourt and Miſs Plinlimmon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>What ſort of a thing is the girl?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Faſh.</speaker>
                  <p>She is very well as to beauty; her ſhape elegantly and harmoniouſly formed, but when in motion, ungraceful. Her mind is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of ignorance and information, like the waving branches that give a checquered kind of light. She made us laugh laſt night at ſupper with the childiſh ſimplicity of her queſtions, and ſometimes ſhe excited our admiration at the quickneſs of her repartee, and the ſolidity of her judgment; in a word, ſhe appears to be an inſpired ideot.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>Now let me have the portrait of Sir Pepper.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Faſh.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir Pepper is a plain, unaſſuming man, ſubject at times to a warmth of temper, and whoſe local train of impoveriſhed ideas are quite unſuitable to the ſcene he is now entering upon, and to the company with which he is now to aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate. His mind has received a peculiar biaſs reſpecting the prophecies that have been floating of late, and he is almoſt convinced the world will be at an end before his daughter has brought Lord Melcourt a ſon and heir.</p>

                  <p>I confeſs, I like the whimſicallity of that notion; it will ſerve to amuſe us.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Faſh.</speaker>
                  <p>As for Lady Plinlimmon, ſhe has a conſiderable ſhare of vanity; half of which ſhe ſpends in admiration of her daughter-in-law, the other ſhe conſumes upon herſelf. She imagines ſhe has a refined taſte for literature, that ſhe is a ſupreme judge of painting, and—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Faſh.</speaker>
                  <p>By no means. There is a broad good-humour about her which makes her inoffenſive. She looks with impatience for the honour of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting an acquaintance with your Ladyſhip.</p>

                  <p>Yeſterday he ſeemed at firſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the invaſion of theſe Vandals; but his native mirth rallied, and at the cloſe of the evening he was himſelf again. But here he comes.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Mel.</speaker>
                  <p>Lady Plinlimmon looks for your arrival with all the flutter of anxious expectation. Your fame, like an artful prologue, has ſmoothed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0304800700:12"/>the way to a kind reception: ſhe talks of you as the paragon of excellence; ſhe will ſtudy your whole perſon; obſerve every motion, attitude, and every article of your dreſs.</p>

                  <p>Lady Bellair may be ſaid to be a capital picture from the gallery of faſhion, for Lady Plinlimmon to copy.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>I will venture to ſay, without the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of vanity, that the copy will not come up to the merit of the original.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Faſh.</speaker>

                  <p>But tell me, brother, don't you feel, independent of the charms of your young bride, an uncommon elaſticity of mind in the removal of the incumbrances which this marriage will effect?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Mel.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes. Upon that ground I plant the ſtandard of my gaudieſt ſtreamer. I have had a private conference with Sir Pepper, and his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate relinquiſhing of his Brecknockſhire eſtate will enable me to part with my Iriſh acres, and ſatisfy all my noiſy claimants; who, like a vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pack of hounds, have chaced me from hill to dale, and notwithſtanding the windings of excuſes, and the intricate mazes of delay, would have ſoon overtaken me, had not this golden ſhower from the Welch mountains put an end to the chace.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Mel.</speaker>
                  <p>I have invited my friend Fancy, the miniature-painter. I expect alſo Phrenſy, the poet, whom you have often heard me talk of; he will ſuit Lady Plinlimmon, and their mutual ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centricities will divert us.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Faſh.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Lord Mel.</speaker>
                  <p>I expect him every minute. He writes word he will be here to-day, but begs his

                  <p>Oh yes! he frequently wrote to me, and he uſed to ſay in his letters, that when I ſhould come to Melcourt Hall, we ſhould wander through the groves together, and he would ſay ſuch tender things to me by the river-ſide. Now we were by the river-ſide yeſterday evening, and ſcarce one word did he ſay to me, but converſed with my papa about the winding of his river; egad! I wiſh it was wound round his neck.</p>

                  <p>Am I then not to expect any ſhare of his converſation? Is there to be no time for wooing? no flirtation? no whiſpering? no toying? no innocent anticipation?</p>

                  <p>Miſs Plinlimmon, the manufacturing of love in Wales may perhaps be as coarſe as a ſackcloth, but in this part of the world, the cupids of faſhion weave the fine texture with a light and inviſible hand.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Miſs Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>Inviſible indeed! But if I am never to partake of his company, what am I come here for? what ſhall I be the better for being married to him? where is the advantage?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>You will obtain the advantage of his name and title; you will move in a higher ſphere.</p>

                  <p>But I always underſtood, that wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock was a kind of travelling through life toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>So it is, but then it is like travelling in the double ſtage-coach; you go the ſame jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney together, without ſeeing or incommoding one another.</p>

               <sp>

                  <p>I hate the double ſtage-coach; I like a vis-a-vis much better. However, if Lord Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court does not become more aſſiduous, he may be ſupplanted—Faſhion is much more attentive.</p>

                  <p>He has lived a great deal abroad, he is lately returned from Africa; I had another ingenious man here, and he was my particular friend, but a ſudden death has deprived me of that invaluable perſon: what I am going to relate, is a ſecret, nobody is acquainted with the terrible accident, except a confidential ſervant. Poor Phrenſy, the poet, died ſuddenly laſt night; he is now in the houſe, and is to be removed this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: I ſhould be happy to have a reſemblance of my old friend, and if you would have the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to take a haſty ſketch of him, you would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely oblige me.</p>

                  <p>It is only changing the local reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, it is at the worſt a ſkilful and elegant inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy; the beauty-ſpot is there, I make no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to what nature has already done, I only bring to the eye of admiration, what her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip informs me nature has rather removed from the ſight.</p>

                  <p>I have taken a much greater licence than this, without feeling any reproach of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for example, when I had the honor of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lady Frizlerump, I broke the immeaſurable length of her bald buff forehead, by introducing two moles and a patch, the patch you know is a thing ad libitum, and as I knew Lady Frizlerump had a mole on each ſhoulder, I removed them from their native ſpot, (they were well worth the carriage) and I placed them in a more conſpicuous ſituation; there is no great deceit in this, it is only
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0304800700:32"/>a kind of tranſplanting, which ought to be as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable in painting as in gardening.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady Bell.</speaker>
                  <p>Here is a miniature of myſelf, which was drawn when I was married, I think the dreſs would ſuit Miſs Plinlimmon.</p>

                  <stage>(Taking the miniature.)</stage>
                  <p>'Tis beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, nor could it be otherwiſe, while it preſumed to have any reſemblance of your Ladyſhip—but you juſt now mentioned your marriage, I know that you and Lord Bellair were ſeparated not long after; intereſted as I am in whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to your Ladyſhip, do not imagine it is mere curioſity that ſolicits ſome illuſtration upon that point.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady Bell.</speaker>
                  <p>I am ready to give you every infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and the more ſo, as ill-nature, that mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonous and dull commentator, may have conſtrued our ſeparation in her invariable manner.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady Plin.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Lady Bell.</speaker>
                  <p>Lord Bellair, ſomewhat advanced in years, palled, and ſatiated with the pleaſures of the town, began to medicate a retreat; but before he retired into the country, from which he was never
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0304800700:34"/>to return, he ranged through all the gay ſcenes of public reſort, to find a youthful aſſociate, to accompany him in his retirement.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>Your myſterious hiſtory begins to unfold itſelf; the beauteous flower that flouriſhed in the bright ſunſhine of admiration, grew pale and cheerleſs when it was tranſplanted to the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary gloom of the country.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs your Ladyſhip's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary apologue compriſes my little ſtory, and makes my continuation unneceſſary.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>Not at all—I beg you will continue your intereſting narrative.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>Lord Bellair, amidſt the innumerable beauties, that at once attracted and bewildered his choice, threw at length his ſelecting glance upon me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>His choice did honor to his taſte.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>It did not however contribute to his happineſs—the ſingle voice of my reluctance was loſt in the chorus of approbation that reſounded from all my relations and friends—I then ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned all the fortitude I was capable of, and took a courageous leave of the town—adieu, I cried, to the flattery of men—to the pleaſing envy of the women—adieu to balls—adieu to the delight of charioteering in a phaeton through St. James's Street every morning—adieu to the eaſy inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the town, to the contemplation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in caracature-ſhops, to the reading of Shakeſpear upon canvaſs, and to the ſtudy of the Engliſh hiſtory upon walls—the fatal hour arrived— the carriage was at the door—</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>You really excite my compaſſion! What enſued when you reached the ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſeat?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>Say rather the family vault!—I wrapt myſelf up in my reſignation, as in a winding ſheet, and thought to have buried myſelf in a huſband—
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0304800700:35"/>the fates decreed otherwiſe: I broke forth from the ponderous marble, beneath which I was quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inurned, and am come again to reſide among the living.</p>

                  <p>The world is a conſiderable gainer be enjoying you once more. Fortunate was the ſtorm that blew ſuch a flower upon the lap of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. But whence aroſe that ſtorm? Did it ariſe from Lord Bellair's ill-temper? however, I am not curious; indeed I can partly gueſs: the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the country, faintly checquered by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits of the apothecary, and the vicar's wife; his Lordſhip's fulſome fondneſs—his odious approaches—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>My dear Lady Plinlimmon, you are going on ſo rapidly! It is of no uſe to reckon the ſlight imperceptible threads of diſcontent, which grew at length into a cable. Behold me reſtored to independence, ſufficiently affluent, and almoſt as happy as a widow.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>May nothing interrupt the happineſs you poſſeſs, and which you deſerve! Before I had the honour of your acquaintance, I heard your merits highly extolled.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>I am exceedingly obliged to thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have ſmoothed my path to your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's partiality. But to whom am I indebted?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>The perſons I allude to are friends of your Ladyſhip, and are neighbours of our's in Wales; they were in town laſt winter; I mean Mrs. Vandal and her ſiſter.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes! I recollect thoſe old tapeſtry figures. But you muſt not imagine there was any intimacy between us! I endured them at my toilet. They may be reckoned, if you pleaſe, among my morning friends, but you may be ſure I never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the creatures in an evening.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>That is charming! I ſhall acquire
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0304800700:36"/>under your auſpices the faſhionable diſcriminations. The morning and evening friend is a happy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction. But I fear I am treſpaſſing upon your time.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Mel.</speaker>
                  <p>There is no occaſion to apply to foreign auxiliaries, for the purpoſes of elegant art—the native growth of our ſoil, amply ſupplies the demands of taſte in every department.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>This relievo, is happily executed! come here, Iſabella, you underſtand mythology. Here is hymen, attended by a group of cupids? Do you conceive the allegoric meaning of the artiſt?</p>

                  <p>Perfectly! Here is Hymen, with a torch in his hand, that is, I ſuppoſe to light the bride and bridegroom home. And the dear little cupids I ſuppoſe, foretell the children.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>Ridiculous! You pervert every thing by your diſtorted applications! But explain the remainder—you ſee night perſonated follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hymen, ſhe throws o'er her frame a mantle ſtudded with ſtars, and among the ſtars, appears a creſcent—</p>

                  <speaker>Miſs Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>The mantle ſtudded with ſtars, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignates the holy ſtillneſs and unruffled union of the marriage ſtate.</p>

                  <p>Miſs Plinlimmon will perhaps do me the honor to explain this compartment— here is Hymen, binding a ſhepherd and a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs with a chain of flowers.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Faſh.</speaker>
                  <p>Upon my word, I think this a moſt excellent allegory, and illuſtrates well the ſhort triumph of matrimony—the chain of roſes is eaſily broken, and the roſes ſoon fade.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Mel.</speaker>
                  <p>Faſhion ſpeaks the language of an inveterate batchelor, yet every thing in nature condemns his ſarcaſm: the birds, that make this grove re-echo with their harmony, what are all their ſongs, but ſo many hymns in honor of the married ſtate.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Faſh.</speaker>
                  <p>I aſk your pardon, Lord Melcourt. The economy of your grove, will not aſſiſt your argument, in defence of Hymen, for every fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered couple who were ſo happy the laſt ſpring are now divorced, and all the harmony and love, which now reign in your woods is the reſult of ſeparation and of new engagements.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>What a wonderful ſyſtem have you brought me acquainted with? I never could have conceived there were ſuch aſtoniſhing things in nature, as male and female flowers—</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Phrenſy.</speaker>
                  <p>I have moſt aſſuredly, let your Ladyſhip a little into Flora's ſecrets.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>Male and female flowers! I am pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified! But tell me, learned profeſſor, when the flowers are at a diſtance from one another, how they communicate their mutual paſſion?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Phrenſy.</speaker>
                  <p>There nature interpoſes her happieſt ſtratagem! She calls her weſtern gales, her amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous zephyrs, and they on heir fragrant wings convey the lovers to each other.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>Now, Sir, as you have led me, as it were, behind the curtain into Flora's green-room, I confeſs, I am not much edified at the morals of the plants? Indeed the flowers appear to be an abandoned profligate race—here is a honey ſuckle, which you ſay contains five males, and only one female—this modeſt ſnow-drop, you tell me, has ſix huſbands—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Phrenſy.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, nature has been rather partial to your ſex in her economy of plants.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>Poor things! What a pity it is they are not endowed with ſenſibility!</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Phrenſy.</speaker>
                  <p>I have obſerved, ſince the ladies of faſhion have applied to the ſtudy of botany, they are not only ambitious of rivaling the flowers in beauty, but they have alſo endeavoured in ſome degree to rival them in their other prerogatives.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>This learned gentleman has raiſed, as it were, the veil of nature, and has revealed to me ſome of her ſecrets; and I muſt own, ſecrets that excite my aſtoniſhment. According to the illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trations of this learned profeſſor, the chalice of every flower is a kind of a houſe of bad fame.</p>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0304800700:48"/>have no effect upon me, and give me leave to obſerve, that I have always found you refrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and uncomplying with any requeſts.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>How can you be ſo unjuſt? Where is the wife throughout Wales that is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placent? Did I ever refuſe to comply with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of yours, from January to January? Indeed, Sir Pepper, I might complain of the very few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences you ever granted me—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>Dare you complain of my want of indulgence, when there is not a whim, that I have not always been ready to indulge you in! When the gardening parſon from England came to us laſt year, did I not ſubmit to have the front of my old foreſt, cicatriſed into clumbs like large pies? Did he not fling a confining belt, as he called it, round my place! As if he thought the hills, vales and woods were going to run away! Did I not let him, to pleaſe you, zig zag the avenue in ſuch a manner, that I could hardly find the way to my own houſe?</p>

                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>Then I was obliged to endure his perpetual panegyric upon himſelf! How he was admitted to all the great tables in town? How he choſe a picture for this Lord—and a fan for that Lady—</p>

                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>Recall, if you pleaſe, the phyſician from the north, who came a practiſe-hunting into wales, did he not come twice a day to the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0304800700:49"/>Caſtle to brace your nerves; was not this another indulgence? There you paſſed day after day, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing on a ſopha! Then the room for ſooth was darkened. As you could endure only a kind of twilight, which you called <hi>a jour doux;</hi> then I was never to be admitted, becauſe I ſpoke ſo loud.</p>

                  <p>Then there was the fencible colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, but I have done. Let me only entreat you not to complain any more of my not granting you any indulgences! Zounds, madam, the Pope at Rome could not have granted you more indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences than I have. But no more, I have only to beg of you to ſtay here till I return with ſome papers for you to ſign, and which Lord Melcourt and Mr. Faſhion are to witneſs.</p>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0304800700:63"/>an old aunt, who lives at the Antipodes of the faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ionable part of the town, and there I retail to her the hiſtoric ſcandal of the fortnight; and then ſhe reads to me through her green ſpectacles, out of a folio, a ſermon of the laſt century.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Mel.</speaker>
                  <p>I hope, Sir Pepper, you will give Lady Bellair ſome credit for that.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>Then I go once in the winter to the Ancient Muſic.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>That, I ſuppoſe, is a concert per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the decayed muſicians.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>Not exactly ſo; it is, however, a very edifying concert, and compoſed of thoſe hoary, venerable notes, that in days of yore delighted the ears of Harry the eighth and Anne Bullen, and is now a very ſuitable recreation for old batchelors, old maids, and emigrant nuns! But to continue the narrative of my mortified inclination: my carriage every morning makes one of the long proceſſion of coaches that beſiege the circulating library in Bond Street.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>That denotes your Ladyſhip's fondneſs for literature.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>I beg yor pardon, Sir Pepper, litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is my averſion; I never look into a book, but I cannot avoid calling every morning at the library; it is a kind of literary tavern, where the waiters are in perpetual demand. A diſh of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ſonnets for Miſs Simper; ſatires with a poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſauce for Mrs. Grumble; a ſirloin of hiſtory for Lady Sleepleſs; a broil'd devil of private anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, highly peppered with ſcandal, for Lady An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica Worthleſs. It would amuſe you, Sir Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to ſee theſe female academics enter the porch of Hookham College, their cheeks, paled by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, a little relieved by a thin ſtratum of morning rouge. Then you would wonder at the method the learned profeſſors adopt of ſupplying the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience of their pupils: for example—one lady
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0304800700:64"/>receives the firſt volume of an author, of which ſhe will never enquire for the ſecond; at the ſame time ſhe receives the ſecond volume of another author, of which ſhe has not yet an idea of the firſt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>Give me leave to obſerve, this vague method of reading muſt create a kind of chaos, without conſiſtency.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>Conſiſtency is a vulgar word, we do not admit into our vocabulary; and as for the chaos you diſapprove of, I really think there is to be found the whole merit; for this miſcellaneous, variegated, unconnected reading, forms the beautiful dove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed, moſaic literature of the female mind.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>I hope you will allow Lady Plin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limmon to be a brilliant exception to your general deſcription.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>Moſt undoubtedly; I have a long liſt of exceptions. But not to interrupt the narrative of my own memoirs—I am ſometimes obliged to mingle with the elegant mob at a ſale of pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>A ſale of pictures muſt be very improving. You there frequently meet with the works of the old maſters.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>The ladies of faſhion do not go to auctions for the ſake of the <hi>old</hi> maſters; do they, Lord Melcourt?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Mel.</speaker>
                  <p>No, indeed! A bow from Lord Gauze, a ſmile from Lord Flimſy, or a compliment from Sir Goſſamer Bagatelle, effaces the names of Rembrant, Corregio, and Vandyke!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>However, we play with the catalogue, and we ſtare at the pictures. And I have heard it obſerved, that in the two late celebrated ſales, the love of Vertú made the ladies gaze at ſome pictures, from which their grand-mammas would have turned away.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0304800700:65"/>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>But then, I will ſay for the ladies, that they ſtole a glance at theſe pictures, through the medium of their long veils, which you know tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a kind of drapery, to the paintings! But to proceed, I am under the obligation, ſometimes, of getting up in the middle of the night, to be in readineſs, to go to a new play, and with all my precaution, I never can get there before the middle of the ſecond act.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>That is very unlucky.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>Not in the leaſt; for I never liſten to the play.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>But does not your talking loud in the firſt row, diſturb the audience?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>I never occupy the firſt row; I place the old ladies, in the firſt and ſecond row, they have nothing to do, (poor things) but to liſten to the play? And then I ſit ſnug on the laſt form, which we call among ourſelves, tattle row, and then perhaps, I am ſeated between Sir Voluble Prattle, and Colonel Eaſy, and we three converſe and titter <hi>a la ſourdine,</hi> the whole evening: but I am afraid I grow dull.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>Quite the reverſe, I aſſure you; I preſume, your Ladyſhip pays more attention to the opera; the ſoftneſs of the Italian language, has ſomething enchanting to a delicate ear.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>I know nothing of the Italian lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, there is no attaining the knowledge of it, without paſſing through the perplexing, jumbling, croſs-roads of a grammar; that would ſhake my intellects to pieces.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>Still the muſic may flatter the ear, though you do not comprehend the words.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>I comprehend the muſic as little as I do the words.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>It is, then, the dancing I conclude delights you—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0304800700:66"/>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>No; the dancing does not particularly intereſt me; indeed I cannot ſee the dancing in my box, for I generally ſit with my back to the ſtage.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>As neither the muſic, nor the dancing has any allurement, I ſuppoſe your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſeldom or never goes to the opera.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>I aſk your pardon, Sir Pepper, I never omit an opera.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir P. Plin.</speaker>
                  <p>What then can be the attraction? I really ſee nothing to entice you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
                  <p>Is it nothing, Sir Pepper, to lean half out of one's box; with the head inclined to give the eaſy feather a more graceful play? which looks a meteor, waving in the air; and which, as the poet ſays,
<q>
                        <l>"Allures attention, from the tuneful ſcene;</l>
                        <l>"Gives fops the flutter, and old maids the ſpleen."</l>
                     </q>
Is it nothing, Sir Pepper, to have all the opera glaſſes levelled at one? To ſit in my box, as on a throne, the unrivalled queen of Fopland?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Mel.</speaker>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs, Lady Bellair, you have an extenſive dominion; Fopland is a very populous country.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>

                  <p>Out of regard to your gallantry, I will introduce a bill to naturaliſe you, Sir Pepper, but not to loſe the thread of my narrative, I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that I go once in the winter to an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, given by the wife of my phyſician; there all his pale convaleſcents ſtalk about like ghoſts;</p>

                  <p>I own I have the appearance of airineſs and levity; but my gaiety is frequently aſſumed, and I have recourſe to diſſipation more as a medicine than a feaſt.</p>

                  <p>As you are ſo kind as to ſpeak to me in ſo unreſerved a manner, I think it incumbent on me to declare that I have no inbred averſion to the girl. I am not ſo faſtidious, ſo difficult, as Melcourt; and I will add, that was I to ſucceed, I would do every thing in my power to contribute to her happineſs, and give me alſo leave to ſay that I believe I am not indifferent to her.</p>

                  <p>With ſuch honorable ſentiments as you now aſſure me you entertain, you have my permiſſion to make the trial. Mutual propenſity, believe me, is the beſt ſecurity for happineſs. The ſmiling flowers ſhe ſcatters from her hand can alone enliven the domeſtic walk! 'Tis ſhe who diſplays to the bride and bridegroom that eternal ſpring which all lovers talk of, but which ſo few expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience! 'Tis ſhe who gilds and diſſipates the clouds of care, and pours upon the ſoul the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſunſhine of the mind.</p>

                  <p>I AM glad to find that my letters are finiſhed. I cannot conceive what Mr. Faſhion has to ſay to me in private.

                  <p>Theſe letters are not intended for to-day's poſt, nor to morrow's poſt; but they are intended for the poſt the day after the wedding. You muſt know that I am bound by a ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to write two letters the day after my mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and as we ſhall be on our road to Ireland on that day, and conſequently ſhall have no time to write, I thought it would be a good plan to write beforehand, and date the letters after the wedding,

               <lg>
                  <l>WITH gloomy bodings for his bantling play,</l>
                  <l>Our Author came to me the other day,</l>
                  <l>A boon to aſk, tho' half afraid to break it;</l>
                  <l>He'd got an Epilogue, and I muſt ſpeak it.—</l>
                  <l>All means he fain would try, if not too late,</l>
                  <l>Still to avert his dread, impending fate.</l>
                  <l>Sad viſions, too, diſtract his anxious brain;</l>
                  <l>Rumours of ills, that wait the ſcribbling train.</l>
                  <l>'Tis ſaid your taſte for Comedy is flown;</l>
                  <l>That darling child you once were proud to own:</l>
                  <l>That Shakeſpear's fires no more your ſenſes rouze;</l>
                  <l>Congreve and Vanbrugh ſeldom fill the houſe;</l>
                  <l>While childiſh pageants ſtuff the crouded ſcene,</l>
                  <l>No mortal even gueſſing what they mean;</l>
                  <l>Fierce wars they wage, and dreadful battles try,</l>
                  <l>With bloodleſs conflict: all one knows not why.</l>
                  <l>Till by the friendly banners we are told,</l>
                  <l>There Macedon's, there Perſia's chief behold!</l>
                  <l>Juſt as on ſigns th' informing words declare,</l>
                  <l>This the Red Lion; that is the Black Bear.</l>
                  <l>Queens, and their maids of honor, wait in vain.</l>
                  <l>Till their mute lovers ſhall their ſuit explain.</l>
                  <l>They'd often heard, indeed from Greece and Rome,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0304800700:83"/>That love was blind; but ne'er that he was dumb.</l>
                  <l>There too thoſe motly, female, manly graces,</l>
                  <l>With almoſt all things naked, but their faces;</l>
                  <l>Thoſe modern Picts, at whom we gaze with wonder;</l>
                  <l>While their keen falchions cut whole ranks aſunder.</l>
                  <l>Great Ruſty-fuſti's triumphs thus we greet;</l>
                  <l>Six holy Roman emp'rors breathleſs at her feet.</l>
                  <l>Nor leſs the neighb'ring temples of Apollo,</l>
                  <l>With equal ſteps the bright example follow.</l>
                  <l>There beardleſs warriors ſqueak each other's doom;</l>
                  <l>And ſilken Vandals plan the fall of Rome.</l>
                  <l>There demigods by entrechâts advance,</l>
                  <l>And Carthage flames demoliſh'd in a dance.</l>
                  <l>Arms claſh, loud thunders roar, and chariots rattle;</l>
                  <l>While jarring trumpets animate the battle.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Now critics, if you're angry think on theſe,</l>
                  <l>And ſpare the bard who ſtrives at leaſt to pleaſe:</l>
                  <l>Judge, and be judg'd, in anger juſt, I pray:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Audire alteram partem</hi> is fair play.</l>
                  <l>In ſuch a cauſe, altho' the taſk be hard;</l>
                  <l>I'll be myſelf of counſel for our bard;</l>
                  <l>I've ſuch authorities as none refuſes,</l>
                  <l>Fleta's, and Coke's, and Blackſtone's of the Muſes;</l>
                  <l>Farqhuar and Rowe, and Wycherly we boaſt!</l>
                  <l>And Avon's mighty ſeer, himſelf a hoſt!</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Yet, for I feel my female fears increaſe,</l>
                  <l>Tho' arm'd for war, <hi>yet ſtill I wiſh</hi> for peace:</l>
                  <l>We own your pow'r, confeſs your wond'rous ſway,</l>
                  <l>Whom all our great dramatic realms obey:</l>

                  <l>Wit is not wit, unleſs your taſte commend it:</l>
                  <l>From th' Author's anvil a mere ſluggiſh maſs;</l>

                  <l>Far better to be good than to be great!</l>
                  <l>Like Britain's Monarch, act your generous parts,</l>
