            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT were an Impoſition on the Town, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to the Memory of the inimitable <hi>BEN JOHNSON;</hi> ſhould I publiſh this Play, without acknowledging that moſt part of the Plot, ſome of the Scenes, and many of the Speeches, are almoſt literally copied from a dramatic Work of his, with the ſame Title. An Attempt at altering a Piece of his, is, I believe, unprecedented, and indeed bold, for one who never before, either burthen'd the Preſs with his Labours, or dar'd the Critic's Cenſure. I was allur'd to the Taſk, by a Number of very noble Sentiments, which are ſcattered through the Original in many Lines, neither harſh or unmuſical; wherein there ſeems to breath the true inſpir'd Spirit of Poetry; and fancy plays within her proper Sphere, under the Reſtraint of a well temper'd critical Judgment; but much more by the ſtrong Contraſt of virtuous and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Characters, with which I found it adorn'd; which is the moſt uſeful, laudable, and conſequently the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Part of the <hi>DRAMA.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0747901600:5"/>
To reduce the Multiplicity of Characters, the Train of Incidents, to make the Parts of <hi>LIVIA,</hi> and <hi>AGRIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PINA,</hi> ſomewhat intereſting, which in <hi>JOHNSON</hi> are very near deſpicable; to ſelect his Beauties, and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means to bring about the Cataſtrophe; ſeem'd, at firſt, an Enterprize as difficult, as toiling for Wealth in a Mine; and almoſt ſtartled me from my Deſign; But however, as I had begun, I determined to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; and of my Succeſs, the Peruſal of the Piece will make you a Judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>JOHNSON</hi>'s ſtrict Adherence to Hiſtory, in his two Plays of <hi>SEJANUS</hi> and <hi>Catiline,</hi> would have been highly commendable, had it not been manifeſtly preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to him; ſince he has been ſo ſcholaſtically nice, as ſcarcely to omit a ſingle Perſon or Incident, mention'd in the Lives of theſe <hi>great wicked</hi> Men; nay he has even tranſlated literally, in his <hi>SEJANUS,</hi> ſeveral Lines from <hi>CORNELIUS TACITUS:</hi> By this Means his Tragedies became rather dramatic Hiſtories, than Entertainments ſuited to a modern Theatre. From this I have ventur'd to deviate; I have kept <hi>CAESAR</hi> at <hi>ROME,</hi> to preſide at the Conviction of <hi>SEJANUS;</hi> as I think it adds much Spirit, to the cloſing the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe; I have drawn him of a Diſpoſition much milder than he was in Reality. The pious Reſolution of repealing the Oppreſſions, and healing the conſtitutional Wounds made by <hi>SEJANUS,</hi> which I have put into his Mouth, in the laſt Speech of the Play, I thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0747901600:6"/>
to preſerve <hi>Poetical Juſtice;</hi> to which I think Hiſtory ſhould give Way; for the real Uſe of dramatic Performances is, to inſtil Virtue, and raiſe an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of Vice. Example is a ſtrong Argument; nothing conduces ſo much to our Reformation, as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the Wicked and rewarding the Virtuous, 'tis then that the Moral is truly ſtrong, indeed the Guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs muſt ſometimes fall, to heighten the Diſtreſs, and impreſs us with a juſt Pity.</p>
            <p>If theſe Liberties ſhould to the Critics appear Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, I honeſtly confeſs them Errors of my Judgment; and for my Confeſſion expect to be mildly treated. By the Critics, I would be underſtood to mean only the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, not ſuch teizing Inſects, ſuch buzzing Drones of Society, as thoſe at preſent diſtinguiſh'd by that Name.</p>

<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0747901600:7"/>
aſſerting that I had a <hi>national Advantage in View,</hi> in this Subject may be thought chimerical, at firſt, but when the following Abſtract from Hiſtory, of the Life of <hi>SEJANUS,</hi> is conſidered, what I have advanced may perhaps be allowed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AELIUS SEJANUS</hi> the Son of <hi>SEIUS STRABO</hi> was born in <hi>TUSCANY.</hi> He ſerved, when young, with ſome Reputation, under <hi>CAIUS CAESAR,</hi> Nephew to <hi>AUGUSTUS,</hi> and afterwards in the <hi>Praetorian Band</hi> under the Command of <hi>TIBERIUS;</hi> to the various Turns of whoſe Diſpoſition by conforming, he gradually crept into his cloſeſt Secrets, and was the firſt in his Eſteem. When <hi>TIBERIUS</hi> mounted the Imperial Throne, he allowed this his favourite, ſuch an Extent of Power, as rendered him the Terror of honeſt Men, and the Idol of Sycophants. The taking off <hi>GERMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NICUS,</hi> Huſband to the <hi>AGRIPPINA,</hi> who is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in this Play, and Nephew to the Emperor, a Prince remarkable for the greateſt Virtues, though the Odium of it was artfully flung on <hi>GNEIUS PISO, GERMANICUS</hi>'s Lieutenant, was generally and juſtly attributed to him: This was his firſt cloſe Attack upon the <hi>LIBERTY</hi> of <hi>ROME,</hi> and procured him the Hatred of the People. After this by the Means of <hi>LIVIA,</hi> Wife to <hi>DRUSUS, EUDEMUS</hi> her Phyſician, and <hi>Lygdus</hi> an Eunuch, who was <hi>SEJANUS</hi>'s <hi>CATAMITE,</hi> he contrived and effected the Death of <hi>DRUSUS,</hi> Son to <hi>TIBERIUS,</hi> and Heir apparent to the Empire. The
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0747901600:8"/>
Reaſon aſſigned for his Hatred, was a Blow which <hi>DRUSUS</hi> one Day gave him; but his future Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhewed, Ambition, not Revenge, was the Motive which urg'd to the Deed; for he had determin'd to remove every Bar, which lay between him and the Throne. This was but a Prelude to his future Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainies. <hi>AGRIPPINA,</hi> her Sons, and all who were Friends to the <hi>Family</hi> of the dead <hi>GERMANICUS,</hi> were next to be diſpoſed of. This was effected by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting them to <hi>CAESAR,</hi> who was naturally of a <hi>jealous</hi> Diſpoſition, as aſpiring and ambitious, and conſequently dangerous. <hi>CAIUS SILIUS</hi> was firſt mark'd out for Sacrifice; who being, before the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, criminated by <hi>VARRO</hi> the Conſul, and finding his Death had been premeditately reſolved on; by a voluntary Wound anticipated a public Execution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SABINUS,</hi> another Adherent to the Family of <hi>GERMANICUS,</hi> was next taken off, by the Means of <hi>LATIARIS,</hi> his Relation and profeſs'd Friend: who having often, with much ſeeming Sincerity, rail'd at the Oppreſſions and Tyranny of <hi>SEJANUS,</hi> and thus, by touching him,
<q>
                  <l>Ev'n on the tend'reſt Point, the Maſter String</l>
                  <l>Which <hi>made</hi> moſt Harmony, or Diſcord in him.</l>
                  <bibl>ROWE.</bibl>
               </q>
Having wrought him up to join in his Invectives, He fix'd two <hi>Senators,</hi> who were <hi>Creatures</hi> to
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0747901600:9"/>
               <hi>SEJANUS,</hi> in a ſecret Place, whence they might overhear the Diſcourſe between <hi>SABINUS</hi> and him; who, on his too freely cenſuring the Conduct of <hi>CAESAR,</hi> ruſh'd from their Ambuſh, accuſed him of Treaſon, and after a formal Proceſs, he was, by Death, eaſed of the Pains which he endured, for the Sufferings of his Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SEJANUS</hi> next, with the Concurrence of <hi>TIBERIUS,</hi> removed <hi>AGRIPPINA</hi> and her <hi>Sons,</hi> ſo that he had none now left to oppoſe his Intereſt with <hi>CAESAR,</hi> or Deſigns upon the <hi>Throne.</hi> Her he had baniſh'd to <hi>PANDATERIA</hi> an <hi>Iſland</hi> in the <hi>TYRRHENE</hi> Sea, <hi>NERO</hi> to the Iſland of <hi>PONTIA</hi> near <hi>NAPLES,</hi> and <hi>DRUSUS</hi> confined in the moſt abject Part of the Palace.</p>
            <p>Being thus ſucceſsful in all his Schemes, what he aimed at became more and more apparent. To faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate his Deſigns on the <hi>EMPEROR,</hi> he endeavoured to demean him in the Opinion of the People, by ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culing his Defects and Imperfections on the <hi>public Theatre.</hi> This firſt induced <hi>CAESAR</hi> to examine more nearly into his Conduct; and he ſoon found it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary for his own Safety, to hurl this <hi>COLOSSUS</hi> of the <hi>ROMAN STATE,</hi> ſuddenly down the Steep of Fate. To effect this appeared ſcarcely practicable, ſince he feared the Fall of this ſtupendous Pile, would drag down with it contiguous Ruin, in which he himſelf might be involved. However he at

laſt compaſſed this coveted end, by the Aſſiſtance of <hi>MACRO,</hi> and a Shew of encreaſing Friendſhip and Truſt, which rendered <hi>SEJANUS</hi> ſtill more ſecure, when his Glory was on the Verge of expiring: He was, when even ſuch an Attempt muſt have ſeem'd impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, accuſed by a Letter from <hi>TIBERIUS</hi> then in <hi>CAPREA,</hi> ſupported by Proofs in full <hi>Senate,</hi> of the moſt flagitious Crimes; condemned with Ignominy, and to the unexpected Joy and Surprize of every <hi>honeſt Roman,</hi> precipitated from the topmoſt Height of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> to the loweſt Depth of <hi>Adverſity</hi> and a ſhameful Death. It is generally and juſtly remarked, that the <hi>Sunſhine</hi> of Proſperity animates a Number of buzzing Flies, who diſappear with its <hi>Decline.</hi> The Truth of this Obſervation was never more apparent than in the Caſe of <hi>SEJANUS,</hi> for not one of the Number of <hi>Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants</hi> and <hi>Dependants,</hi> who had been the Inſtruments of his villanies, and who held large Fortunes and Titles from his Bounty, offered to defend him at his Fall, or even wore the Face of Concern; nay ſo far from it, they were his moſt ſanguine Enemies, and hurried him onward to his Fate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SEJANUS</hi> ſeemed to have been mark'd out by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence as an Example to Futurity, of that Juſtice which will at one Time or other overtake the <hi>Great bad Man</hi> who uſes his Power to oppreſs, or to curtail the <hi>Liberties</hi> of his <hi>Country.</hi> And were this his Hiſtory

            <p>The ſame Soil which was bleſſed with a <hi>BRUTUS,</hi> a <hi>CATO</hi> and a <hi>GERMANICUS,</hi> was curſed with a <hi>SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JANUS: BRITAIN</hi> who feels herſelf happy in an <hi>ORRERY,</hi> a <hi>CHESTERFIELD,</hi> and had in the Perſon of her late generally and juſtly lamented <hi>PRINCE</hi> of <hi>WALES,</hi> all that <hi>ROME</hi> boaſted in her <hi>GERMANICUS,</hi> knows not what <hi>SEJANUS</hi> may riſe in future Times to wound her Peace.</p>
            <p>Buſineſs detaining me in the Country, I requeſted my Friend Mr. <hi>DERRICK</hi> to preſent this Play to Mr. <hi>GARRICK,</hi> which he accordingly did, and was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by him an Anſwer in four or five Days. Mr. <hi>DERRICK</hi> waited on him again about that Time, when with a <hi>Punctuality,</hi> which is not at all anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Character generally given of <hi>theatrical Managers,</hi> he returned the Piece with ſome Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as to its Merits, alledging, that it had too much Declamation in it, to ſucceed on the <hi>Stage;</hi> and I am induced to believe, that though this <hi>Play</hi> was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to Mr. <hi>GARRICK</hi> under any <hi>particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Influence,</hi> he took the Trouble to peruſe it, and on that alone founded his Anſwer.</p>

                  <l>WHY are my Thoughts ſtill miniſtring freſh Pain?</l>
                  <l>Why are new Cares ſtill rank'ling in my Mind?</l>
                  <l>Nature aloud calls out for balmy Reſt,</l>
                  <l>But all in vain. My ever waking Soul,</l>
                  <l>Sits brooding o'er a Train of Images,</l>

                  <l>In ev'ry Thing but Name, an Emperor!</l>
                  <l>Is not Ambition glutted with my Store?</l>

                  <l>Reflection, ſtill a gloomy Proſpect ſhews.</l>
                  <l>Remorſe the <hi>Raven</hi> of a guilty Mind,</l>
                  <l>Is ever croaking horrid in my Ear;</l>
                  <l>Often I rouſe to baniſh it away,</l>

                  <l>And like PROMETHES' <hi>Vulture,</hi> ever gnaws.</l>
                  <l>What then is Glory, without ſoft Repoſe?</l>
                  <l>If ſweet Content is baniſh'd from my Soul,</l>
                  <l>Life grows a Burden, and a Weight of Woe.</l>
                  <l>Oh! that I could run o'er my Race again,</l>
                  <l>Then would I chuſe to tread the humble Vale,</l>
                  <l>Nor lab'ring climb up Greatneſs painful Hill.</l>
                  <l>But my paſt Deeds have ſet me beyond Cure,</l>
                  <l>And I muſt ſtill go on or worſe endure.</l>
