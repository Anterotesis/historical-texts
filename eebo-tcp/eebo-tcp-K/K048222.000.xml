            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN I conſider the inſignificancy of this trifle, I am ſurpriſed at my own teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: my reaſon would have recoiled, and left nothing but my preſumption to attend it to your Royal feet, had not your graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous condeſcenſion, in permitting it to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach You, encouraged me in the laudable attempt to celebrate (though by humble means) an aera, auſpicious, great, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The Guardian Genius of Britain having placed a Brunſwick on the Throne,

ſaw, and ſelf-approving, ſmiled upon her work; and Victory, when determined to beſtow her richeſt wreaths of laurel upon Britiſh valour, to perpetuate her bounty, wiſely choſe that point of time which ſhe foreſaw muſt be the darling theme of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ages, the period that gave birth to the PRINCE of WALES. Then it was that ſhe crowned Monckton and Rodney with ſucceſs; and, by the capture of <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico,</hi> ſecured the conqueſt of Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and a ſupreme power over the trade and navigation of the ſeas, and that immeaſurable chain of iſlands which extend from the Eaſtern point of Hiſpaniola, almoſt to the Continent of South America, With this view did ſhe command Albemarle, the Pupil of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Cumberland, and Pocock, who had before triumphed in the Eaſt, now to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our conqueſts over the Weſtern world. The Havannah, from its ſituation, a place of the firſt importance to our enemies, the grand rendezvous of the galleons, thought

impregnable from nature, yet fortified by every poſſible contrivance of military art, moſt unpromiſing to a foe, from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of its acceſs, and defended by a Roman ſpirit, in the perſon of Velaſco, at this great criſis, from the intrepidity, perſeverance, and unanimity of our land and ſea forces, yielded to the Britiſh flag.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the brilliant tranſactions of a year which makes a golden page in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh annals, we ſee Granby Victorious on the banks of the Weſer; and our gracious Monarch, on the auſpicious morning, when his beloved and amiable Conſort gives an Heir to Britain, beholds the treaſures of Spain paſs before his Palace walls. So many illuſtrious, circumſtances attending your Royal Highneſs's dawn of life, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a zenith of glory; and the ſhining qualities of your youth juſtify our hopes, and give an ample ſatisfaction to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. As You were the early bleſſing, ſo will You prove the latter comfort of your

in the world; and for ſeven or eight days, by your orders, I ſearch'd the Court, the city, the country, for the charming original: my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours proved fruitleſs, and you begin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of ever finding this lovely incognita; when one day, in hunting, led by the ardour of the chace, having ſtray'd from your ſuite, you find yourſelf near the park walls of this caſtle— hear the cry of diſtreſs, ſee women purſued by a huge and fierce boar. Fired with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous alarm at their danger, you fly to their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; to kill this monſter, was but the work of a minute; but what a minute of delight, of tranſport! A young Lady from wearineſs and fright having fallen at the foot of a tree, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to your eyes the very identical lovely ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the picture. Thus, in ſaving <hi>her</hi> life, your firſt interview was the moſt auſpicious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your's.</p>

                  <p>I own, my dear Frederick, hitherto I have reaſon to be content; as yet, 'tis certain, my quality is a ſecret to Don Leopold and his.daughter; and as I was firſt introduced to them. by your name, they ſtill imagine me to be Don Frederick. The amiable Seraphina liſtens to my vows with the moſt flattering complacency, approves my paſſion, anſwer's each gentle ſigh, each tender look, with the ſweet ſympathy of

Oh Sir, if you were but to ſee her! Such an air, ſuch a charming
