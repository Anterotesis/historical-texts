            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>IN an avowed alteration of THE ROBBERS of SCHILLER, it may surprize and disappoint many admirers of that highly celebrated work to find so much of the original dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed for the introduction of new matter. I therefore feel it necessary to state my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for having rather founded a Play on SCHILLER'S than merely adapted THE ROB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERS for representation.</p>
            <p>Captivated by its beauties, I had no other plan when I first undertook to prepare the work for the Stage, than to make curtail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and such variations as most Dramas require that are not native productions. When completed agreeably to this design, its performance was prohibited by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censer. I was unable at the time to account for this interdict, having carefully expunged all sentiments that appeared to war against establishments and good order. I am aware of an objection which has been made to CHARLES DE MOOR, the Hero of THE ROB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERS, importing that the grandeur of his character renders him more likely to excite
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:1193100800:3"/>
imitation than abhorrence; but this objection I have ever considered as unfounded. For surely to exhibit a man whose youthful irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities are the primary cause of his subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent misery, and who, driven by desperation to a life of infamy, feels the most pungent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish for his crimes, and expects that eternal torments will be his punishment, is so far from violating the purest system of ethics, that I am at a loss to conceive how a more forcible lesson of morality can be inculcated.</p>
            <p>On a more dispassionate investigation of the Play, however I found much to justify the licenser's decision. Compunction for villainy seems the peculiar feature of CHARLES: the rest of the Robbers combine brutal insensibility of their enormities with the most heroic attachment to their leader. This junction of sublime virtue with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate depravity, though it may be found in nature, should never be dragged into view:—the heroism dazzles the mind, and renders it blind to the atrocity.</p>
            <p>Still unwilling wholly to abandon a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite object, I determined on forming a Play, which should retain as much as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the original, with the omission of
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:1193100800:4"/>
all that could be deemed objectionable. This point was only to be accomplished by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the enterprize of the leading charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and his associates from an infamous into an honourable pursuit. The history of chivalry naturally suggested itself, as abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with instances of such warlike combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the cause of religion and justice. Spain presented the most eligible scene of action, where those associations were so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, that many of the most glorious vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories over the Moors were effected solely by bands of Knight-adventurers, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of St. Jago, Calatrava, Alcantara, &amp;c. owe their origin to such laudable confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracies.</p>
            <p>By this change in the outline I have been enabled to submit a portion of SCHILLER'S ROBBERS to an English audience. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that has attended this alteration must obviously have been considerable, as I was compelled to reconcile contradictions, to produce the same effects from totally oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site causes: in short, in the words of my archetype, to make 'Angels of criminals.'</p>
            <p>Some striking passages of the original, which might with consistency have been
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1193100800:5"/>
preserved in this alteration, are omitted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause already adopted in recent productions. I mention this circumstance solely for my own vindication, that I may not be accused of a tasteless rejection of beauties. There are situations still retained which may remind the audience of what they have seen before: these I conceived to be of too much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the piece, and too forcible in their nature, to incur banishment for no fault but having been deemed worthy of imitation.</p>

               <l>That, since the German Stage can so delight,</l>
               <l>He brings you something from that Stage to-night.</l>
               <l>A work that foreign wits with zeal admire</l>
               <l>For genuine pathos, dignity, and fire.</l>
               <l>And should, through him, its vigour have declin'd,</l>

                     <p>Ay, then we should need no stretch of policy to gain our wishes. Ferdinand dead, I am the absolute heir of my step-father, Count Lades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's wealth and power. That was determined on my mother's union with him. Each by a former marriage having a son, the compact was, that on the failure of more issue, Ferdinand and myself were mutual heirs. A contract well stipulated by my prudent mother; as my in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance is not a twentieth part of the rich lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships of Ladesma.</p>

                     <p>That still has filled me with astonishment: since my absence from my father, he seems not only to have lost his former fondness for me, but almost to have forgotten that I am his son.

The emissaries of Don Juan de Lara and Don Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel have so completely influenced his feeble mind, that he is inflamed against you with the most unnatural resentment, for the zeal you have testified in the cause of your Sovereign against those powerful rebels.

I grieve to add, that what you will deem the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest revenge is already effected. Eugenia, your beloved betrothed Eugenia, has been forced by him into the arms of one of the rebel adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and borne away by this husband ravisher I know not whither.

Hear me, Ferdinand: you are chosen the leader of an enterprize which will immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize our names. Shall our swords, which have borne destruction to our country's foes, rust in indolence, while that country needs their use? while Moorish robbers ravage our fertile plains, and fellow countrymen and fellow Christians are made the slaves of Infidels?</p>

My poor Eugenia! one tear to thy loss and thy distress, and now I am all my country's. Come, fellow warriors, hasten to take the sacred vows of chivalry; and when its holy badge adorns your bosoms, the Infidels shall prove we wear the ensigns of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion's soldiers, not for vain ornament nor empty form; but as the zealous active ministers of Heaven. Be it our glorious duty to redeem our altars from unbelieving impious violators; to release the groaning captive from the gloomy dungeon where he lies, body and mind in

shackles; forced even to suppress the prayer he would offer to his God; and all his torments ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by hearing hourly blasphemies against the Being he adores.

                  <p>I HAVE lost all patience. An old man's existence is an eternity. If one could find a new avenue for death's entrance into the ſort of life, by wounding the soul to kill the body, ha! could that be effected? But what horrible emotion would have force at once to break the heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strings? Rage? No! That hungry wolf sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits himself and regorges his meal. Grief? That's a worm that lingers in the flesh, and mines his way too slowly! Fear? No: Hope blunts his dart, and will not let him strike his prey! <stage>(Musing)</stage> I have it—Terror is the word! Reason, religion, hope, all must retreat before this giant fiend—and then—should he even bear the shock, there is more behind. Ye blissful years o'erpast, display your charms to memory's fond retrospect, and poison with your sweets the present hour! Ye scenes of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bliss, combine to wound; shew him the joys of paradise before him, and hold the daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zling mirror out to hope, but cheat his feeble grasp! Thus let me play my battery of death till nature's mound is broken, and the whole troop of furies seize the soul, and end their work by horror and despair. Now then to execute—</p>

                     <p>Bertran, we have done much, but still have much to accomplish. The old man's fondness for his son may yet defeat my purposes; and the girl too—Eugenia I mean—pursues him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly with her tears and reproaches. He'll soon be sending in quest of him; and if he be found, good night to both of us. Then shall I who would raise you to honour, and load you with riches, be myself a despised beggar.</p>

                     <p>A few days after, we came to an engagement. Your son behaved like a gallant soldier: he saw five regiments successively relieved, and he kept his ground. A shower of arrows was poured in on every quarter—your son kept his ground—a spear pierced his right hand; he seized the colours with his left, and still he kept his ground.</p>

                     <p>On the evening of the day of battle, I found him lying on the field on that same spot, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in his blood. In a faultering voice he cried, "dear friend, go seek my father, tell him his malediction was my doom; 'twas that which made me rush on battle and on death—I die in despair."

Here in his gaudy palace and his groves rivalling e'en his Prophet's paradise; here the luxurious delegated despot, immersed in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and inflamed with pride, mistakes the purpose of his exaltation, and feels as all were for his use, not he for the good of all. The cries of wretchedness against oppression disturb the pleasures of the soft voluptuary, and are forbid to wound his ears. Hence the mighty fearless oppress the weak, and he himself, placed to be guardian of the poor, grasps at their humble pittance to swell his luxury; and tho' his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince is to check oppression, becomes the worst oppressor.</p>

wretchedness, he would be wise who rather chose to be enrolled the slave of the most lordly ruler of the East, than bear the mockery of a freeman's name where slaves are become rulers. No! there alone is happinesss where Law is supreme, not Will. Will uncontrolled, even if prone to goodness, is clogged with Nature's passions and infirmities; Law speaks the dictates of unclouded Reason; and there only Justice dwells, where those who deal the law are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the law.</p>

                     <p>The flame of love which animates their breasts, has touched the smouldering fire long pent up in my heart, and makes it blaze with fury uncontrollable. Eugenia! oh my lost Eugenia! I know no second love could falsify thy vows to me; then what must be thy anguish and despair, doomed to a villain's power. Yes I will seek thee! I will pace the farthest limits of the world to see and to redeem the idol of my heart. First in disguise I will enter my father's castle. It shall be so. Friends, with the morning's dawn I must depart. Garcias, do thou remain, with force sufficient to preserve the conquest we have added to our Sovereign's crown. The rest I know will gladly follow me; when they shall hear that love and happiness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire the expedition. This day devote to joy. To morrow we embrace again the toils of Knighthood.</p>

You hunger and thirst for honour, and if you get that—oh what a delicious banquet you think it! Now I can make nothing of such windy diet—honour is a fine thing, as it leads to other fine things—It is like the sound of a trumpet to call one to dinner; I hear it with rapture, considering what it invites me to; but you are ravished with the music without caring for what follows it.</p>

                  <head>SCENE III.</head>
                  <stage>The Forest and ruined Tower. The old Count <hi>DE LADESMA</hi> seated on a stone—<hi>FERDINAND</hi> stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by him.</stage>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>FERDINAND.</speaker>
                     <p>AND was your son dear to you?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LADESMA.</speaker>
                     <p>Heaven knows how dear!—Oh! now I feel the truth of what Eugenia uttered! "In vain, when on your death bed, you shall stretch your feeble hands to grasp your Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand—he never will approach your bed—never more comfort you." <stage>
                           <hi>(Fedinand,</hi> turning away his head, gives him his hand.)</stage> Oh were this the hand of my Ferdinand!—But he is gone! No son have I to close my eyes!</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>FERDINAND.</speaker>
                     <p>Should I discover myself while he remains in this feeble state, his joy might kill him: yet I must gain from him his blessing. <stage>(He throws himself at his feet.)</stage> I broke the iron bolts of the dungeon—blessed old man! I ask thy kiss for that.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>
                        <stage>(Pressing him to his bosom.)</stage> Take this, and think it is a father's kiss—and I will dream I hold my Ferdinand to my breast. What! do you weep?</p>

                        <stage>(With great emotion.)</stage> I thought it was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's kiss! <stage>(Throws himself on his neck. Shouts and flourish of trumpets without. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> rises hastily.)</stage> Hark! 'tis vengeance comes!</p>
