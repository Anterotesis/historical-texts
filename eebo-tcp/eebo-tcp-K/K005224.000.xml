            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It was <hi>Cynthio</hi>'s humour to run down every thing that was rather for oſtentation than uſe. He was ſtill preferring good ſenſe to arts and ſciences, and often took a pleaſure to appear ignorant, that he might the better turn to ridicule thoſe that valued themſelves on their books and ſtudies, though at the ſame time one might very well ſee that he could not have attacked many parts of learning ſo ſucceſsfully, had not he borrowed his aſſiſtances from them.

I have however one ſtrong Prejudice in favour of it, that <hi>Philander</hi> has thought it worth his while to employ ſome time upon it. I am glad then, ſays <hi>Cynthio,</hi> that I have thrown him on a ſcience of which I have long wiſhed to hear the Uſefulneſs. There, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> you muſt excuſe me. At preſent you do not know but it may have its uſefulneſs. But ſhould I endeavour to convince you of it, I might fail in my attempt, and ſo render my ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſtill more contemptible. On the contrary, ſays <hi>Cynthio,</hi> we are already ſo perſuaded of the unprofitableneſs of your ſcience, that you can but leave us where you find us, but if you ſucceed you increaſe the number of your party. Well, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> in hopes of making two ſuch conſiderable proſelytes, I am very well content to talk away an evening with you on the ſubject; but on this condition, that you will communicate your thoughts to me freely when you diſſent from me, or have any difficulties that you think me capable of removing. To make uſe of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty you give us, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> I muſt tell you what I believe ſurprizes all beginners as well as my ſelf. We are apt to think your Medalliſts a little fantaſtical in the different prices they ſet upon their coins, without any regard to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient value or the metal of which they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. A ſilver Medal, for example, ſhall be more eſteemed than a golden one, and a piece of braſs than either. To anſwer you, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> it

We find too on Medals the repreſentations of Ladies that have given occaſion to whole volumes on the account only of a face. We have here the pleaſure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine their looks and dreſſes, and to ſurvey at leiſure thoſe beauties that have ſometimes been the happineſs or miſery of whole kingdoms: Nor do you only meet the faces of ſuch as are famous in hiſtory, but of ſeveral whoſe names are not to be found any where except on Medals. Some of the Emperors, for example, have had Wives, and ſome of them Children, that no authors have mentioned. We are therefore obliged to the ſtudy of coins for having made new diſcoveries to the learned, and given them information of ſuch perſons as are to be met with on no other kind of records. You muſt give me leave, ſays <hi>Cynthio,</hi> to reject this laſt uſe of Medals. I do not think it worth while to trouble my ſelf with a perſon's name or face that receives all his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from the mint, and would never have been known in the world had there not been ſuch things as Medals.

and of ſeveral who had won the prizes at the Olympic games. It was a noble time, ſays <hi>Cyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thio,</hi> when Trips and <hi>Corniſh</hi> hugs could make a man immortal. How many Heroes would <hi>Moor-fields</hi> have furniſhed out in the days of old? A fellow that can now only win a hat or a belt, had he lived among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> might have had his face ſtampt upon their Coins. But theſe were the wiſe ancients, who had more eſteem for a <hi>Milo</hi> than a <hi>Homer,</hi> and heapt up greater Honours on <hi>Pindar</hi>'s Jockies, than on the Poet himſelf. But by this time I ſuppoſe you have drawn up all your medallic people, and indeed they make a much more formidable body than I could have imagined. You have ſhewn us all conditions, ſexes and ages, emperors and empreſſes, men and children, gods and wreſtlers. Nay you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured up perſons that exiſt no where elſe but on old Coins, and have made our Paſſions and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Vices viſible. I could never have thought that a cabinet of Medals had been ſo well peopled. But in the next place, ſays <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> as we ſee on coins the different Faces of perſons, we ſee on them too their different Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and Dreſſes, according to the mode that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the ſeveral ages when the Medals were ſtampt. This is another uſe, ſays <hi>Cynthio,</hi> that in my opinion contributes rather to make a man learned than wiſe, and is neither capable of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the underſtanding or imagination. I know there are ſeveral ſupercilious Critics that will treat an author with the greateſt contempt imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, if he fancies the old <hi>Romans</hi> wore a girdle, and are amazed at a man's ignorance, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the <hi>Toga</hi> had any Sleeves to it till the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion

of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Now I would fain know the great importance of this kind of learning, and why it ſhould not be as noble a task to write upon a Bib and hanging-ſleeves, as on the <hi>Bulla</hi> and <hi>Praetexta.</hi> The reaſon is, that we are familiar with the names of the one, and meet with the other no where but in learned authors. An Antiquary will ſcorn to mention a pinner or a night-rail, a petticoat or a manteau; but will talk as gravely as a father of the church on the <hi>Vitta</hi> and <hi>Peplus,</hi> the <hi>Stola</hi> and <hi>Inſtita.</hi> How would an old <hi>Roman</hi> laugh, were it poſſible for him to ſee the ſolemn diſſertations that have been made on theſe weighty ſubjects!

In the mean time, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> you find on Medals every thing that you could meet with in your magazine of antiquities, and when you have built your arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, wardrobes, and ſacriſties, it is from Medals that you muſt fetch their furniture. It is here too that you ſee the figures of ſeveral inſtruments of muſick, mathematics and mechanics.

                     <hi>Cynthio,</hi> we find that <hi>Felix</hi> is never written with an <hi>oe</hi> dipthongue, and that in <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s days <hi>Civis</hi> ſtood for <hi>Cives,</hi> with other ſecrets in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thography of the ſame importance.</p>
                  <p>To come then to a more weighty uſe, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> it is certain that Medals give a very great light to hiſtory, in confirming ſuch paſſages as are true in old Authors, in ſettling ſuch as are told after different manners, and in recording ſuch as have been omitted. In this caſe a cabinet of Medals is a body of hiſtory. It was indeed the beſt way in the world to perpetuate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of great actions, thus to coin out the life of an Emperor, and to put every great exploit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mint. It was a kind of Printing, before the art was invented. It is by this means that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Vaillant</hi> has diſembroiled a hiſtory that was loſt to the world before his time, and out of a ſhort collection of Medals has given us a chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Kings of <hi>Syria.</hi> For this too is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage Medals have over books, that they tell their ſtory much quicker, and ſum up a whole volume in twenty or thirty reverſes. They are indeed the beſt epitomes in the world, and let you ſee with one caſt of an eye the ſubſtance of above a hundred pages. Another uſe of Medals is, that they not only ſhew you the actions of an Emperor, but at the ſame time mark out the year in which they were performed. Every exploit has its date ſet to it. A ſeries of an Emperor's Coins is his life digeſted into annals. Hiſtorians ſeldom break their relation with a mixture of chronology, nor diſtribute the particulars of an Emperor's ſtory into the ſeveral years of his reign: or where they do it they often differ in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0251102100:17"/>
periods. Here therefore it is much ſafer to quote a Medal than an Author, for in this caſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This I muſt confeſs, ſays <hi>Cynthio,</hi> may in ſome caſes be of great moment, but conſidering the ſubjects on which your chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers are generally employed, I ſee but little uſe that riſes from it. For example, what ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it to the world whether ſuch an Elephant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Amphi-theatre in the ſecond or the third year of <hi>Domitian?</hi> Or what am I the wiſer for knowing that <hi>Trajan</hi> was in the fifth year of his Tribuneſhip when he entertained the people with ſuch a Horſe-race or Bull-baiting? Yet it is the fixing of theſe great periods that gives a man the firſt rank in the republic of letters, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends him to the world for a perſon of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reading and profound erudition.</p>
                  <p>You muſt always give your men of great reading leave to ſhow their talents on the meaneſt ſubjects, ſays <hi>Eugenius</hi>; it is a kind of ſhooting at rovers: where a man lets fly his arrow without taking any aim, to ſhew his ſtrength.

                  <p>I thank you, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> for helping me to an uſe that perhaps I ſhould not have thought on. But there is another of which I am ſure you could not be but ſenſible when you were at <hi>Rome.</hi> I muſt own to you it ſurprized me to ſee my <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceroni</hi> ſo well acquainted with the buſts and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of all the great people of antiquity. There was not an Emperor or Empreſs but he knew by ſight, and as he was ſeldom without Medals in his pocket, he would often ſhew us the ſame face on an old Coin that we ſaw in the Statue. He would diſcover a <hi>Commodus</hi> through the diſguiſe of the club and lion's skin, and find out ſuch a one to be <hi>Livia</hi> that was dreſſed up like a <hi>Ceres.</hi> Let a buſt be never ſo diſfigured, they have a thouſand marks by which to decipher it. They will know a <hi>Zenobia</hi> by the ſitting of her Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, and will diſtinguiſh the <hi>Fauſtina's</hi> by their different way of tying up their hair. Oh! Sir, ſays <hi>Cynthio,</hi> they will go a great deal farther, they will give you the name and titles of a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that has loſt his noſe and ears; or if there is but half a beard remaining, will tell you at firſt ſight who was the owner of it. Now I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to you, I uſed to fancy they impoſed upon me an Emperor or Empreſs at pleaſure, rather than appear ignorant.</p>
                  <p>All this however is eaſily learnt from Medals, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> where you may ſee likewiſe the

Theſe are buildings with the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> could not demoliſh, that are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more durable than ſtone or marble, and will perhaps laſt as long as the earth it ſelf.

I have read an Author of this taſte that compares a ragged Coin to a tattered Colours. But to come again to our Subject. As we find on Medals the plans of ſeveral buildings that are now demoliſhed, we ſee on them too the Models of many ancient Statues that are now loſt.

It is indeed an uſe that no body has hitherto dwelt upon. If any of the Antiquaries have touched upon it, they have immediately quitted it, without conſidering it in its full latitude, light and extent. Not to keep you in ſuſpence, I think there is a great affinity between Coins and Poetry, and that your Medalliſt and Critic are much nearer related than the world generally imagines. A reverſe often clears up the paſſage of an old poet, as the poet often ſerves to unrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a reverſe. I could be longer on this head, but I fear I have already tired you.

the next place, the figure of the ſhield being round it is an emblem of perfection, for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has ſaid the round figure is the moſt perfect. It may likewiſe ſignify the immortal reputation that the Emperor has acquired by his great actions, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tundity being an emblem of eternity that has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beginning nor end. After this I dare not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for the ſhield's convexity that it does not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a myſtery, nay there ſhall not be the leaſt wrinkle or flouriſh upon it which will not turn to ſome account. In this caſe therefore <note n="*" place="bottom">Poema eſt pictura loquax.</note> Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try being in ſome reſpects an art of deſigning as well as Painting or Sculpture, they may ſerve as Comments on each other. I am very well ſatisfied, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> by what you have ſaid on this ſubject, that the Poets may contribute to the explication of ſuch reverſes as are purely emblematical, or when the perſons are of that ſhadowy allegorical nature you have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but I ſuppoſe there are many other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes that repreſent things and perſons of a more real exiſtence. In this caſe too, ſays <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> a Poet lets you into the knowledge of a device better than a Proſe-writer, as his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions are often more diffuſe, his ſtory more naturally circumſtanced, and his language en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with a greater variety of epithets: So that you often meet with little hints and ſuggeſtions in a Poet that give a great illuſtration to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, actions, ornaments, and all kinds of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are to be met with on ancient Coins. I fancy, ſays <hi>Cynthio,</hi> there is nothing more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than an Antiquary's reading the <hi>Greek</hi> or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0251102100:28"/>
                     <hi>Latin</hi> Poets. He never thinks of the beauty of the thought or language, but is for ſearching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what he calls the Erudition of the Author. He will turn you over all <hi>Virgil</hi> to find out the figure of an old <hi>Roſtrum,</hi> and has the greateſt eſteem imaginable for <hi>Homer,</hi> becauſe has given us the faſhion of a <hi>Greek</hi> ſcepter. It is indeed odd enough to conſider how all kinds of Readers find their account in the old Poets. Not only your men of the more refined or ſolid parts of Learning, but even your Alchymiſt and Fortune-teller will diſcover the ſecrets of their art in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> This, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of a very ancient ſtanding. Read but <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>'s diſcourſe on <hi>Homer,</hi> and you will ſee that the Iliad contains the whole circle of arts, and that <hi>Thales</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſtole all their philoſophy out of this Poet's works. One would be amazed to ſee what pains he takes to prove that <hi>Homer</hi> underſtood all the figures in Rhetoric, before they were invented. I do not queſtion, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> were it poſſible for <hi>Homer</hi> to read his praiſes in this Author, but he would be as much ſurprized as ever Monſieur <hi>Jordain</hi> was when he had found he had talked Proſe all his life-time without ever knowing what it was. But to finiſh the task you have ſet me, we may obſerve that not only the Virtues, and the like imaginary perſons, but all the heathen Divinities appear generally in the ſame Dreſs among the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets that they wear in Medals. I muſt confeſs, I believe both the one and the other took the Mode from the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Statuaries. It will not perhaps be an improper tranſition to paſs from the heathen gods to the ſeveral monſters of antiquity,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0251102100:29"/>
as <hi>Chimaeras, Gorgons, Sphinxes,</hi> and many others that make the ſame figure in verſe as on coins. It often happens too, that the Poet and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Rome</hi> have both choſen the ſame Topic to flatter their Emperor upon, and have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fallen upon the ſame thought. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they both of them lay upon the catch for a great action: It is no wonder therefore, that they were often engaged on one ſubject, the Medal and the Poem being nothing elſe but oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional compliments to the Emperor. Nay, I queſtion not but you may ſometimes find certain paſſages among the Poets that relate to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular device of a Medal.</p>
                  <p>I wonder, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that your Medalliſts have not been as diligent in ſearching the Poets as the Hiſtorians, ſince I find they are ſo capable of enlightning their art. I would have ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy put the Muſes under a kind of contribution to furniſh out whatever they have in them that bears any relation to Coins. Though they taught us but the ſame things that might be learnt in other writings, they would at leaſt teach us more agreeably, and draw ſeveral over to the ſtudy of Medals that would rather be inſtructed in verſe than in proſe. I am glad, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> to hear you of this opinion, for to tell you truly, when I was at <hi>Rome,</hi> I took occaſion to buy up many Imperial Medals that have any affinity with paſſages of the ancient Poets. So that I have by me a ſort of poetical Caſh, which I fancy I could count over to you in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> verſe, If you will drink a diſh of Tea with me to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row morning, I will lay my whole collection before you.

I am apt to think <hi>Virgil</hi> had a further view in this requeſt of <hi>Juno</hi> than what his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have diſcovered in it. He knew very well that his <hi>Aeneid</hi> was founded on a very doubtful ſtory, and that <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s coming into <hi>Italy</hi> was not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally received among the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves. He knew too that a main objection to this ſtory was the great difference of Cuſtoms, Language and Habits among the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Trojans.</hi> To obviate therefore ſo ſtrong an objection, he makes this difference to ariſe from the forecaſt and prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination of the Gods themſelves. But pray what is the name of the Lady in the next Medal? Methinks ſhe is very particular in her Quoiffure.</p>

The interpreters of this Medal have miſtaken theſe two figures for the repreſentation of two perſons that are drowning. But as they are both naked and drawn in a poſture rather of trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing o'er the waves than of ſinking under them, ſo we ſee abundance of Water-Deities on other Medals repreſented after the ſame manner.

After having thus far cleared our way to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, I take the thought of the reverſe to be this. The ſtranded veſſel is the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> that by the tyranny of <hi>Domitian,</hi> and the inſolence of the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Guards under <hi>Nerva,</hi> was quite run aground and in danger of periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

Your Device, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> hangs very well together; but is not it liable to the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions that you made us laſt night to ſuch expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations as have nothing but the writer's imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſupport them? To ſhew you, ſays <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> that the conſtruction I put on this Medal is conformable to the fancies of the old <hi>Romans,</hi> you may obſerve, that <hi>Horace</hi> repreſents at length the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> under the figure of a ſhip, in the Allegory that you meet with in the fourteenth Ode of his firſt book.

not been explained by others, as many of them have been explained in a different manner. There are indeed others that have had very near the ſame explication put upon them, but as this explication has been ſupported by no authority, it can at beſt be looked upon but as a probable conjecture. It is certain, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> there cannot be any more authentic illuſtrations of <hi>Roman</hi> Medals, eſpecially of thoſe that are full of fancy, than ſuch as are drawn out of the <hi>Latin</hi> Poets. For as there is a great affinity between Deſigning and Poetry, ſo the <hi>Latin</hi> Poets, and the Deſigners of the <hi>Roman</hi> Medals, lived very near one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were acquainted with the ſame cuſtoms, converſant with the ſame objects, and bred up to the ſame reliſh for wit and fancy. But who are the Ladies that we are next to examine? Theſe are, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> ſo many Cities, Nations and Provinces that preſent themſelves to you under the ſhape of women. What you take for a fine Lady at firſt ſight, when you come to look into her will prove a town, a country, or one of the four parts of the world.

This is one of the pleaſanteſt Maps, ſays <hi>Cynthio,</hi> that I ever ſaw.

I could not have thought your mountains, ſeas and promontories could have made up an aſſembly of ſuch well-ſhaped perſons. This therefore, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> is a Geography particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to the Medalliſts. The Poets however have ſometimes given into it, and furniſh us with very

I need not mention her ſitting on the ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have already ſpoken of the aptneſs of ſuch a poſture to repreſent an extreme affliction. I fancy, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> might have an eye on the cuſtoms of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nation, as well as of thoſe of their country, in the ſeveral marks of ſorrow they have ſet on this figure. The Pſalmiſt deſcribes the <hi>Jews</hi> lamenting their captivity in the ſame penſive poſture. <hi>By the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of</hi> Babylon <hi>we ſate down and wept, when we remembred thee, O</hi> Sion. But what is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, we find <hi>Judaea</hi> repreſented as a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in ſorrow ſitting on the ground, in a paſſage of the Prophet that foretells the very captivity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this Medal. The covering of the head, and the rending of garments, we find very often in Holy Scripture, as the expreſſions of a raging grief. But what is the tree we ſee on both theſe Medals? We find, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> not only on theſe, but on ſeveral other coins that relate to <hi>Judaea,</hi> the figure of a Palm-tree, to ſhow us that Palms are the growth of the country.

                  <p>Our three friends had paſſed away the whole morning among their Medals and <hi>Latin</hi> Poets. <hi>Philander</hi> told them it was now too late to enter on another Series, but if they would take up with ſuch a dinner as he could meet with at his Lodgings, he would afterwards lay the reſt of his Medals before them. <hi>Cynthio</hi> and <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> were both of them ſo well pleaſed with the novelty of the ſubject, that they would not refuſe the offer <hi>Philander</hi> made them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Philander</hi> was here enjoying the cool of the morning, among the dews that lay on every thing about him, and that gave the air ſuch a freſhneſs as is not a little agreeable in the hot part of the year. He not been here long before he was joined by <hi>Cynthio</hi> and <hi>Eugenius. Cyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thio</hi> immediately fell upon <hi>Philander</hi> for breaking his night's reſt. You have ſo filled my head, ſays he, with old Coins, that I have had nothing but figures and inſcriptions before my eyes. If I chanced to fall into a little ſlumber, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately interrupted with the viſion of a <hi>Cadu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus</hi> or a <hi>Cornu-copiae.</hi> You will make me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> that you begin to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to Medals. They ſay it is a ſure ſign a man loves money, when he is uſed to find it in his dreams. There is certainly, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> ſomething like Avarice in the ſtudy of Medals. The more a man knows of them, the more he deſires to know. There is one ſubject in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular that <hi>Cynthio,</hi> as well as my ſelf, has a mind to engage you in. We would fain know how the Ancient and Modern Medals differ from one another, and which of them deſerves the preference. You have a mind to engage me in a ſubject, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> that is perhaps of a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger extent than you imagine. To examine it thoroughly, it would be neceſſary to take them
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0251102100:141"/>
in pieces, and to ſpeak of the difference that ſhews it ſelf in their Metals, in the Occaſion of ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, in the Inſcriptions, and in the Figures that adorn them. Since you have divided your ſubject, ſays <hi>Cynthio,</hi> be ſo kind as to enter on it without any further preface.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould firſt of all, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> conſider the difference of the Metals that we find in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern Coins, but as this ſpeculation is more curious than improving, I believe you will excuſe me if I do not dwell long upon it. One may underſtand all the learned part of this ſcience, without knowing whether there were Coins of iron or lead among the old <hi>Romans,</hi> and if a man is well acquainted with the Device of a Medal, I do not ſee what neceſſity there is of being able to tell whether the Medal it ſelf be of copper or <hi>Corinthian</hi> braſs. There is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſo great a difference between the antique and modern Medals, that I have ſeen an Antiquary lick an old Coin, among other tryals, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the age of it by its Taſte. I remember when I laught at him for it, he told me with a great deal of vehemence, there was as much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the reliſh of ancient and modern braſs, as between an apple and a turnep. It is pity, ſays <hi>Engenius,</hi> but they found out the Smell too of an ancient Medal. They would then be able to judge of it by all the ſenſes. The Touch, I have heard, gives almoſt as good evidence as the Sight, and the Ringing of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal is, I know, a very common experiment. But I ſuppoſe this laſt proof you mention relates only to ſuch Coins as are made of your baſer ſorts of metal. And here, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0251102100:142"/>
the prudence of the Ancients above that of the Moderns, in the care they took to perpetuate the memory of great actions. They knew very well that ſilver and gold might fall into the hands of the covetous or ignorant, who would not reſpect them for the Device they bore, but for the Metal they were made of. Nor were their apprehenſions ill-founded; for it is not eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined how many of theſe noble monuments of hiſtory have periſhed in the goldſmiths hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to be collected together by the learned men of theſe two or three laſt Centuries. Inſcriptions, Victories, Buildings, and a thouſand other pieces of antiquity were melted down in thoſe barbarous Ages, that thought figures and letters only ſerved to ſpoil the gold that was charged with them. Your Medalliſts look on this deſtruction of Coins, as on the burning of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Library, and would be content to compound for them, with almoſt the loſs of a <hi>Vatican.</hi> To prevent this in ſome meaſure, the ancients placed the greateſt variety of their devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on their braſs and copper Coins, which are in no fear of falling into the clippers hands, nor in any danger of melting till the general confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration. On the contrary, our modern Medals are moſt in ſilver or gold, and often in a very ſmall number of each. I have ſeen a golden one at <hi>Vienna,</hi> of <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, that weighed two and twenty pound, which is probably ſingular in its kind, and will not be able to keep it ſelf long out of the furnace when it leaves the Emperor's Treaſury. I remember another in the King of <hi>Pruſſia</hi>'s collection, that has in it three pound weight of gold. The Princes who ſtruck theſe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0251102100:143"/>
Medals, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> ſeem to have deſigned them rather as an oſtentation of their Wealth, than of their Virtues. They fancied probably, it was a greater honour to appear in gold than in copper, and that a Medal receives all its value from the rarity of the metal. I think the next ſubject you propoſed to ſpeak of, were the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Occaſions that have given birth to ancient and modern Medals.</p>
                  <p>Before we enter on this particular, ſays <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> I muſt tell you by way of preliminary, that formerly there was no difference between Money and Medals. An old <hi>Roman</hi> had his purſe full of the ſame pieces that we now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in Cabinets. Aſſoon as an Emperor had done any thing remarkable, it was immediately ſtamped on a Coin, and became current through his whole Dominions. It was a pretty contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, ſays <hi>Cynthio,</hi> to ſpread abroad the virtues of an Emperor, and make his actions circulate. A freſh Coin was a kind of a <hi>Gazette,</hi> that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the lateſt news of the Empire. I ſhould fancy your <hi>Roman</hi> Bankers were very good Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians. It is certain, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> they might find their profit and inſtruction mixed together. I have often wondered that no nation among the moderns has imitated the antient <hi>Romans</hi> in this particular. I know no other way of ſecuring theſe kinds of monuments, and making them nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous enough to be handed down to future ages. But where Stateſmen are ruled by a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of faction and intereſt, they can have no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the glory of their country, nor any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the figure it will make among poſterity. A man that talks of his nation's honour a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0251102100:144"/>
years hence, is in very great danger of being laught at. We ſhall think, ſays <hi>Cynthio,</hi> you have a mind to fall out with the Government, becauſe it does not encourage Medals. But were all your ancient Coins that are now in Cabinets once current money? It is the moſt probable opinion, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> that they were all of them ſuch, excepting thoſe we call Meda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions. Theſe in reſpect of the other Coins were the ſame as modern Medals, in reſpect of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern money. They were exempted from all commerce, and had no other value but what was ſet upon them by the fancy of the owner. They are ſuppoſed to have been ſtruck by Emperors for preſents to their Friends, foreign Princes, or Ambaſſadors. However, that the ſmallneſs of their number might not endanger the loſs of the devices they bore, the <hi>Romans</hi> took care gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to ſtamp the ſubject of their Medalions on their ordinary Coins that were the running caſh of the nation. As if in <hi>England</hi> we ſhould ſee on our half-penny and farthing pieces, the ſeveral deſigns that ſhow themſelves in their perfection on our Medals.</p>
                  <p>If we now conſider, continued <hi>Philander,</hi> the different Occaſions or Subjects of ancient and modern Medals, we ſhall find they both agree in recording the great actions and ſucceſſes in war, allowing ſtill for the different ways of making it, and the circumſtances that attended it in paſt ages, and in the preſent. I ſhall inſtance one. I do not remember in any old Coin to have ſeen the taking of a town mentioned: as indeed there were few conquerors could ſignalize themſelves that way before the invention of powder and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0251102100:145"/>
fortifications, a ſingle battle often deciding the fate of whole kingdoms. Our modern Medals give us ſeveral ſieges and plans of fortified towns, that ſhow themſelves in all their parts to a great advantage on the reverſe of a Coin. It is indeed, a kind of juſtice, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that a Prince owes to poſterity, after he has ruined or defaced a ſtrong place to deliver down to them a model of it as it ſtood whole and entire. The Coin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs in ſome meaſure the miſchiefs of his Bombs and Cannons. In the next place, ſays <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> we ſee both on the ancient and modern Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals the ſeveral noble pieces of Architecture that were finiſhed at the time when the Medals were ſtamped. I muſt obſerve however, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the latter, that they have repreſented their buildings according to the rules of perſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive. This I remember to have ſeen but in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few of the plans on ancient Coins, which makes them appear much leſs beautiful than the modern, eſpecially to a mathematical eye. Thus far our two ſetts of Medals agree as to their Subject. But old Coins go farther in their compliments to their Emperor, as they take occaſion to celebrate his diſtinguiſhing Virtues; not as they ſhowed themſelves in any particular action, but as they ſhone out in the general view of his character. This humour went ſo far, that we ſee <hi>Nero</hi>'s fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and <hi>Commodus</hi>'s skill in fencing, on ſeveral of their Medals. At preſent, you never meet with the King of <hi>France</hi>'s generoſity, nor the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's devotion recorded after this manner. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the <hi>Romans</hi> uſed to regiſter the great actions of Peace that turned to the good of the people, as well as thoſe of War. The remiſſion of a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0251102100:146"/>
Debt, the taking off a Duty, the giving up a Tax, the mending a Port, or the making a Highway, were not looked upon as improper ſubjects for a Coin. They were glad of any opportunity to encourage their Emperors in the humour of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, and knew very well, that many of theſe acts of beneficence had a wider and more laſting influence on the happineſs and welfare of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than the gaining a Victory, or the Conqueſt of a nation. In <hi>England</hi> perhaps it would have looked a little odd to have ſtamped a Medal on the aboliſhing of Chimney-money in the laſt Reign, or on the giving a hundred thouſand pound a year towards the carrying on a war, in this. I find, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> had we ſtruck in with the practice of the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> we ſhould have had Medals on the fitting up our ſeveral Docks, on the making of our Rivers navigable, on the building our men of War, and the like ſubjects, that have certainly very well deſerved them. The reaſon why it has been neglected, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> may poſſibly be this. Our Princes have the coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their own Medals, and perhaps may think it would look like vanity to erect ſo many Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies and Monuments of praiſe to their own merit; whereas among the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> the Senate had ſtill a watchful eye on their Emperor, and if they found any thing in his life and actions that might furniſh out a Medal, they did not fail of making him ſo acceptable an offering. 'Tis true, their flatteries betray often ſuch a baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, as one would little expect to find among ſuch an order of men. And here by the way we may obſerve, that you never find any thing like Satyr or Raillery on old Coins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:0251102100:147"/>Whatever victories were got on foreign ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or the ſeveral pretenders to the Empire obtained over one another, they are recorded on Coins without the leaſt bitterneſs or reflection. The Emperors often jeſted on their rivals or predeceſſors, but their Mints ſtill maintained their gravity. They might publiſh invectives againſt one another in their diſcourſes or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but never on their Coins. Had we no other hiſtories of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, but thoſe we find on their money, we ſhould take them for the moſt virtuous race of Princes that mankind were ever bleſſed with: whereas, if we look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their lives, they appear many of them ſuch monſters of luſt and cruelty, as are almoſt a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to human nature. Medals are therefore ſo many compliments to an Emperor, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to him all the Virtues and Victories he himſelf pretended to. Were you to take from hence all your informations, you would fancy <hi>Claudius</hi> as great a Conqueror as <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> a wiſer Prince than his brother <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. Tiberius</hi> on his Coins is all Mercy and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, <hi>Caligula</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> are Fathers of their Country, <hi>Galba</hi> the patron of public Liberty, and <hi>Vitellius</hi> the reſtorer of the city of <hi>Rome.</hi> In ſhort, if you have a mind to ſee the religious <hi>Commodus,</hi> the pious <hi>Caracalla,</hi> and the devout <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> you may find them either in the inſcription or device of their Medals. On the contrary, thoſe of a modern make are often char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Irony and Satyr. Our Kings no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er fall out, but their mints make war upon one another, and their malice appears on their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals. One meets ſometimes with very nice
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0251102100:148"/>
touches of Raillery, but as we have no inſtance of it among the ancient Coins, I ſhall leave you to determine, whether or no it ought to find a place there. I muſt confeſs, ſays <hi>Cynthio,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we are generally in the wrong, when we deviate from the ancients: becauſe their practice is for the moſt part grounded upon reaſon. But if our fore-fathers have thought fit to be grave and ſerious, I hope their poſterity may laugh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence. For my part, I cannot but look on this kind of Raillery as a refinement on Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals: and do not ſee why there may not be ſome for diverſion, at the ſame time that there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of a more ſolemn and majeſtic nature, as a Victory may be celebrated in an Epigram as well as in an Heroic Poem. Had the ancients given place to Raillery on any of their Coins, I queſtion not but they would have been the moſt valued parts of a collection. Beſides the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment we ſhould have found in them, they would have ſhown us the different ſtate of Wit, as it flouriſhed or decayed in the ſeveral ages of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. There is no doubt, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> but our fore-fathers, if they had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, could have been as witty as their poſterity. But I am of opinion, they induſtriouſly avoided it on their Coins, that they might not give us oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſuſpect their ſincerity. Had they run into mirth or ſatyr we ſhould not have thought they had deſigned ſo much to inſtruct as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert us. I have heard, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſtamped ſeveral Coins on the ſame occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. If we follow their example, there will be no danger of deceiving poſterity: ſince the more ſerious ſort of Medals may ſerve as Comments
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0251102100:149"/>
on thoſe of a lighter character. However it is, the raillery of the Moderns cannot be worſe than the flattery of the Ancients. But hitherto you have only mentioned ſuch Coins as were made on the Emperor, I have ſeen ſeveral of our own time that have been made as a compliment to private perſons. There are pieces of money, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> that during the time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, were coined in honour of the Senate, Army or People. I do not remember to have ſeen in the upper Empire the face of any private perſon that was not ſome way related to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial family. <hi>Sejanus</hi> has indeed his Conſulſhip mentioned on a Coin of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as he has the honour to give a name to the year in which our Saviour was crucified. We are now come to the Legend or Inſcription of our Medals, which as it is one of the more eſſential parts of them, it may deſerve to be examined more at length. You have choſen a very ſhort Text to enlarge upon, ſays <hi>Cynthio</hi>: I ſhould as ſoon expect to ſee a Critique on the Poſie of a Ring, as on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a Medal.</p>
                  <p>I have ſeen ſeveral modern Coins, ſays <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> that have had part of the Legend running round the edges, like the <hi>Decus et Tutamen</hi> in our milled money; ſo that a few years will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wear out the action that the Coin was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to perpetuate. The ancients were too wiſe to regiſter their exploits on ſo nice a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. I ſhould fancy, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns may have choſen this part of the Medal for the inſcription, that the figures on each ſide might appear to a greater advantage. I have obſerved in ſeveral old Coins a kind of confuſion between
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0251102100:150"/>
the legend and the device. The figures and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were ſo mingled together, that one would think the Coiner was hard put to it on what part of the money to beſtow the ſeveral words of his inſcription. You have found out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like an excuſe, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> for your milled Medals, if they carried the whole legend on their edges. But at the ſame time that they are lettered on the edges, they have other inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the face and the reverſe. Your modern Deſigners cannot contract the occaſion of the Medal into an inſcription that is proper to the Volume they write upon: ſo that having ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled over both ſides, they are forced, as it were to write upon the margin. The firſt fault there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I ſhall find with a modern legend, is its Diffuſiveneſs. You have ſometimes the whole ſide of a Medal over-run with it. One would fancy the Author had a deſign of being <hi>Ciceroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> in his <hi>Latin,</hi> and of making a round period I will give you only the reverſe of a Coin ſtampt by the preſent Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> on the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ſiege of <hi>Vienna.</hi> VIENNA AVSTRIA<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What a majeſty and force does one meet with in theſe ſhort Inſcriptions! Are not you amazed to ſee ſo much hiſtory gathered into ſo ſmall a compaſs? You have often the ſubject of a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume in a couple of words.</p>
                  <p>If our modern Medals are ſo very prolix in their proſe, they are every whit as tedious in their verſe. You have ſometimes a dull Epigram of four lines. This, ſays <hi>Cynthio,</hi> may be of great uſe to immortalize Punns and Quibbles, and to let poſterity ſee their forefathers were a parcel of blockheads. A Coin, I find, may be of great uſe to a bad Poet. If he cannot become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal by the goodneſs of his verſe, he may by the durableneſs of the Metal that ſupports it. I ſhall give you an inſtance, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> from a Medal of <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> that will ſtand as an eternal monument of Dullneſs and Bravery.

                  <p>It is well, ſays <hi>Cynthio,</hi> you tell us this is a Medal of the Great <hi>Guſtavus:</hi> I ſhould have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it for ſome one of his <hi>Gothic</hi> Predeceſſors. Does it not bring into your mind <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great's being accompanied with a <hi>Chaerilus</hi> in his <hi>Perſian</hi> expedition? If you are offended at the homelineſs of this Inſcription, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> what would you think of ſuch as have neither ſenſe nor grammar in them? I aſſure you I have ſeen the face of many a great Monarch hemmed in with falſe <hi>Latin.</hi> But it is not only the ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and tediouſneſs of theſe Inſcriptions that I find fault with; ſuppoſing them of a moderate length and proper ſenſe, why muſt they be in verſe? We ſhould be ſurprized to ſee the title of a ſerious book in rhime, yet it is every whit as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to give the ſubject of a Medal in a piece of an Hexameter. This however is the practice of our modern Medalliſts. If you look into the ancient Inſcriptions, you ſee an air of ſimplicity in the words, but a great magnificence in the thought; on the contrary, in your modern Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals you have generally a trifling thought wrapt up in the beginning or end of an Heroic verſe. Where the ſenſe of an Inſcription is low, it is not in the power of <hi>Dactyls</hi> and <hi>Spondees</hi> to raiſe it; where it is noble, it has no need of ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ornaments. I remember a Medal of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the ſecond, on <hi>Charles le Quint</hi>'s reſigning to him the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> with this Inſcription, <hi>Ut Quieſcat Atlas.</hi> The Device is a <hi>Hercules</hi> with the Sphere on his ſhoulders. Notwithſtanding
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0251102100:153"/>
the thought is poetical, I dare ſay you would think the beauty of the Inſcription very much loſt, had it been — <hi>requieſcat ut Atlas.</hi> To inſtance a Medal of our own nation. After the concluſion of the peace with <hi>Holland,</hi> there was one ſtampt with the following Legend — <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deant Commercia Flandris.</hi> The thought is here great enough, but in my opinion it would have looked much greater in two or three words of proſe. I think truly, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> it is ridiculous enough to make the Inſcription run like a piece of a verſe, when it is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of an old Author. But I would fain have your opinion on ſuch Inſcriptions as are borrowed from the <hi>Latin</hi> Poets. I have ſeen ſeveral of this ſort that have been very prettily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and I fancy when they are choſen with art, they ſhould not be thought unworthy of a place in your Medals.</p>
                  <p>Which ever ſide I take, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> I am like to have a great party againſt me. Thoſe who have formed their reliſh on old Coins, will by no means allow of ſuch an innovation; on the contrary, your men of wit will be apt to look on it as an improvement on ancient Medals. You will oblige us however to let us know what kind of rules you would have obſerved in the choice of your quotations, ſince you ſeem to lay a ſtreſs on their being choſen with Art. You muſt know then, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> I do not think it enough that a quotation tells us plain matter of fact, unleſs it has ſome other accidental orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſet it off. Indeed if a great action that ſeldom happens in the courſe of human affairs, is exactly deſcribed in the paſſage of an old Poet, it
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0251102100:154"/>
gives the Reader a very agreeable ſurprize, and may therefore deſerve a place on a Medal.</p>
                  <p>Again, if there is more than a ſingle circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the action ſpecified in the quotation, it pleaſes a man to ſee an old exploit copied out as it were by a Modern, and running parallel with it in ſeveral of its particulars.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, when the quotation is not only apt, but has in it a turn of Wit or Satyr, it is ſtill the better qualified for a Medal, as it has a double capacity of pleaſing.</p>
                  <p>But there is no Inſcription fitter for a Medal, in my opinion, than a quotation that beſides its aptneſs has ſomething in it lofty and ſublime: for ſuch an one ſtrikes in with the natural great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſoul, and produces a high idea of the perſon or action it celebrates, which is one of the principal deſigns of a Medal.</p>
                  <p>It is certainly very pleaſant, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> to ſee a verſe of an old Poet, revolting as it were from its original ſenſe, and ſiding with a modern ſubject. But then it ought to do it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly of its own accord, without being forced to it by any change in the words, or the punctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for when this happens, it is no longer the verſe of an ancient Poet, but of him that has converted it to his own uſe.</p>
                  <p>You have, I believe, by this time exhauſted your ſubject, ſays <hi>Philander</hi>; and I think the criticiſms you have made on the poetical quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that we ſo often meet with in our modern Medals, may be very well applied to the Mottos of books, and other Inſcriptions of the ſame nature. But before, we quit the Legends of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, I cannot but take notice of a kind of wit
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0251102100:155"/>
that flouriſhes very much on many of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Germany,</hi> when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent in the Inſcription the year in which they were coined. As to mention to you another of <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus. C</hi>HR<hi>I</hi>ST<hi>V</hi>S <hi>DVX</hi> ER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GO TR<hi>IVM</hi>PH<hi>V</hi>S. If you take the pains to pick out the figures from the ſeveral words, and range them in their proper order, you will find they amount to 1627, the year in which the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal was coined; for do not you obſerve ſome of the letters diſtinguiſh themſelves from the reſt, and top it over their fellows? theſe you muſt conſider in a double capacity, as letters and as cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. Your laborious <hi>German</hi> Wits will turn you over a whole Dictionary for one of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Devices. You would fancy perhaps they were ſearching after an apt claſſical term, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that, they are looking out a word that has an L. an M. or a D. in it. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſee any of theſe Inſcriptions, you are not ſo much to look in them for the thought, as for the year of the Lord. There are foreign U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſities where this kind of wit is ſo much in vogue, that as you praiſe a man in <hi>England</hi> for being an excellent Philoſopher or Poet, it is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary character among them to be a great Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nogrammatiſt. Theſe are probably, ſays <hi>Cynthio,</hi> ſome of thoſe mild provinces of Acroſtic land, that Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has aſſigned to his Anagrams, Wings and Altars. We have now done, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, with the Legend of a Medal. I think you promiſed us in the next place to ſpeak of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>
                  <p>As we had a great deal of talk on this part of a Coin, replied <hi>Philander,</hi> in our diſcourſe on
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0251102100:156"/>
the Uſefulneſs of ancient Medals, I ſhall only juſt touch on the chief heads wherein the Ancient and the Modern differ. In the firſt place, the <hi>Romans</hi> always appear in the proper Dreſs of their country, inſomuch that you ſee the little variations of the Mode in the drapery of the Medal. They would have thought it ridiculous to have drawn an Emperor of <hi>Rome</hi> in a <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Cloak or a <hi>Phrygian</hi> Mitre. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, our modern Medals are full of <hi>Toga's</hi> and <hi>Tunica's, Trabea's</hi> and <hi>Paludamentums,</hi> with a multitude of the like antiquated garments, that have not been in faſhion theſe thouſand years. You ſee very often a King of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France</hi> dreſſed up like a <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> One would think they had a mind to paſs themſelves upon poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors. The ſame obſervation may run through ſeveral cuſtoms and religions, that appear in our ancient and modern Coins. Nothing is more uſual than to ſee Alluſions to <hi>Roman</hi> cuſtoms and ceremonies on the Medals of our own nation. Nay very often they carry the figure of a heathen god. If poſterity takes its notions of us from our Medals, they muſt fancy one of our Kings paid a great devotion to <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> that another was a profeſſed Worſhipper of <hi>Apollo,</hi> or at beſt that our whole religion was a mixture of Paganiſm and Chriſtianity. Had the old <hi>Romans</hi> been guilty of the ſame extravagance, there would have been ſo great a confuſion in their Antiquities, that their Coins would not have had half the uſes we now find in them. We ought to look on Medals as ſo many monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conſigned over to Eternity, that may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly laſt when all other memorials of the ſame
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0251102100:157"/>
Age are worn out or loſt. They are a kind of Preſent that thoſe who are actually in Being make over to ſuch as lie hid within the depths of Futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Were they only deſigned to inſtruct the three or four ſucceeding generations, they are in no great danger of being miſunderſtood: but as they may paſs into the hands of a poſterity, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie many removes from us, and are like to act their part in the world, when its governments, manners and religions may be quite altered; we ought to take a particular care not to make any falſe reports in them, or to charge them with any Devices that may look doubtful or unintelligible.</p>
                  <p>I have lately ſeen, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> a Medallic hiſtory of the preſent King of <hi>France.</hi> One might expect, methinks, to ſee the Medals of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the higheſt perfection, when there is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety penſioned and ſet apart on purpoſe for the deſigning of them.</p>
                  <p>We will examine them, if you pleaſe, ſays <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> in the light that our foregoing obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have ſet them: but on this condition that you do not look on the faults I find in them any more than my own private opinion. In the firſt place then, I think it is impoſſible to learn from the <hi>French</hi> Medals either the religion, cuſtom, or habits of the <hi>French</hi> nation. You ſee on ſome of them the Croſs of our Saviour, and on others <hi>Hercules</hi>' his Club. In one you have an Angel, and in another a <hi>Mercury.</hi> I fancy, ſays <hi>Cynthio,</hi> poſterity would be as much puzzled on the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>Louis le Grand,</hi> were they to learn it from his Medals, as we are at preſent on that of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great. It is certain, ſays <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> there is the ſame mixture of Chriſtian and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0251102100:158"/>
Pagan in their Coins; nor is there a leſs confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in their cuſtoms. For example, what rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is there between the figure of a Bull, and the planting of a <hi>French</hi> colony in <hi>America</hi>? The <hi>Romans</hi> made uſe of this type in alluſion to one of their own cuſtoms at the ſending out of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony. But for the <hi>French,</hi> a Ram, a Hog, or an Elephant, would have been every whit as ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant an emblem. Then can any thing be more unnatural than to ſee a King of <hi>France</hi> dreſſed like an Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> with his arms ſtripped up to the elbows, a Laurel on his head, and a <hi>Chlamys</hi> over his ſhoulders? I fancy, ſays <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> the ſociety of Medalliſts would give you their reaſons for what they have done. You your ſelf allow the Legend to be <hi>Latin,</hi> and why may not the cuſtoms and ornaments be of the ſame country as the language? eſpecially ſince they are all of them ſo univerſally underſtood by the learned. I own to you, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> if they only deſign to deliver down to poſterity the ſeveral parts of their Great Monarch's hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is no matter for the other circumſtances of a Medal; but I fancy it would be as great a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and inſtruction for future ages, to ſee the Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Cuſtoms of their anceſtors, as their Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and Victories. Beſides, I do not think they have always choſen a proper Occaſion for a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal. There is one ſtruck, for example, on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> failing in their attempts on <hi>Dunkirk</hi>: when in the laſt reign they endeavoured to blow up a Fort, and bombard the town. What have the <hi>French</hi> here done to boaſt of? A Medal how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you have with this inſcription, DVNKIRKA ILLAESA. Not to cavil at the two K's in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0251102100:159"/>
                     <hi>Dunkirka,</hi> or the impropriety of the word <hi>Illaeſa,</hi>

                     <q xml:lang="lat">

                     </q>
I could mention a few other faults, or at leaſt what I take for ſuch. But at ſame time muſt be forced to allow, that this Series of Medals is the moſt perfect of any among the moderns in the beauty of the Work, the aptneſs of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and the propriety of the Legend. In theſe and other particulars, the <hi>French</hi> Medals come nearer the ancients than thoſe of any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as indeed it is to this nation we are indebted for the beſt lights that have been given to the whole ſcience in general.</p>
                  <p>I muſt not here forget to mention the Medal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic hiſtory of the Popes, where there are many Coins of an excellent workmanſhip, as I think they have none of thoſe faults that I have ſpoken of in the preceding ſett. They are always <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholic in the Device and in the Legend, which are both of them many times taken out of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, and therefore not unſuitable to the character of the Prince they repreſent. Thus when <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. lay under terrible apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the <hi>French</hi> King, he put out a Coin, that on the reverſe of it had a ſhip toſſed on the waves to repreſent the Church. Before it, was the figure of our Saviour walking on the waters, and St. <hi>Peter</hi> ready to ſink at his feet. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, if I remember, was in <hi>Latin. Help
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0251102100:160"/>
Lord, or elſe I periſh.</hi> This puts me in mind, ſays <hi>Cynthio,</hi> of a Paſquinade, that at the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ime was fixed up at <hi>Rome. Ad Galli cantum Petrus flet.</hi> But methinks, under this head of the figures on ancient and modern Coins, we might expect to hear your opinion on the difference that appears in the Workmanſhip of each. You muſt know then, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> that till about the end of the third Century, when there was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral decay in all the arts of deſigning, I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have ſeen the head of a <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror drawn with a full face. They always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in <hi>profil,</hi> to uſe a <hi>French</hi> term of art, which gives us the view of a head, that, in my opinion, has ſomething in it very majeſtic, and at the ſame time ſuits beſt with the dimenſions of a Medal. Beſides that it ſhows the noſe and eyebrows, with the ſeveral prominencies and fallings in of the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, much more diſtinctly than any other kind of figure. In the lower Empire you have abundance of broad <hi>Gothic</hi> faces, like ſo many full Moons on the ſide of a Coin. Among the moderns too, we have of both ſorts, though the fineſt are made after the antique. In the next place, you find the figures of many ancient Coins riſing up in a much more beautiful <hi>relief</hi> than thoſe on the modern. This too is a beauty that fell with the grandeur of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, ſo that you ſee the face ſinking by degrees in the ſeveral declenſions of the Empire, till about <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time it lies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt even with the ſurface of the Medal. After this it appears ſo very plain and uniform, that one would think the Coiner look'd on the flatneſs of a figure as one of the greateſt beauties in Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I fancy, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> the Sculptors of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0251102100:161"/>
that age had the ſame reliſh as a <hi>Greek</hi> Prieſt that was buying ſome religious pictures at <hi>Venice.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others he was ſhown a noble piece of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</hi> The Prieſt having well ſurvey'd it, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much ſcandalized at the extravagance of the <hi>relief,</hi> as he termed it. You know, ſays he, our religion forbids all idolatry: We admit of no I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages but ſuch as are drawn on a ſmooth ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face: The figure you have here ſhown me, ſtands ſo much out to the eye, that I would no ſooner ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it in my Church than a Statue. I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend your <hi>Greek</hi> Prieſt, ſays <hi>Philander,</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of celebrated Painters on this ſide of the <hi>Alps</hi> that would not fail to pleaſe him. We muſt own however, that the figures on ſeveral of our modern Medals are raiſed and rounded to a very great perfection. But if you compare them in this particular with the moſt finiſhed among the ancients, your men of art declare univerſally for the latter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cynthio</hi> and <hi>Eugenius,</hi> though they were well pleaſed with <hi>Philander</hi>'s diſcourſe, were glad how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to find it at an end: for the Sun began to gather ſtrength upon them, and had pierced the ſhelter of their walks in ſeveral places. <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> had no ſooner done talking, but he grew ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the heat himſelf, and immediately propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to his friends the retiring to his lodgings, and getting a thicker ſhade over their heads. They both of them very readily cloſed with the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and by that means give me an opportunity of finiſhing my Dialogue.</p>

                  <p>He ſhews how theſe advantages will ſtill riſe higher after a peace, notwithſtanding our preſent conqueſts, with new additions, ſhould be confirmed to us, as well becauſe the monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> would not be weakened by ſuch conceſſions, as becauſe no Guarantee could be found ſufficient to ſecure them to us. For which reaſons he lays it down as a fixt Rule, that no peace is to be made without an entire diſunion of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchies.</p>
                  <p>That this may be brought about, he endeavours to prove from the progreſs we have already made towards it, and the ſucceſſes w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the preſent war, which are very conſiderable if well purſued, but of no effect if we acquieſce in them.</p>
                  <p>In order to complete this diſunion in which we have gone ſo far, he would not have us rely upon exhauſting the <hi>French</hi> Treaſury, attempts on the <hi>Spaniſh Indies,</hi> Deſcents on <hi>France,</hi> but chiefly upon out-numbring them in troops, <hi>France</hi> being already drained of her beſt ſupplies, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates maſters of much greater forces for multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and ſtrength, both in men and horſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Generals of greater fame and abilities.</p>
                  <p>He then conſiders the wrong meaſures we have hitherto taken in making too ſmall levies after a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful campaign, in regulating their number by that of the enemies forces, and hiring them of our confederates; ſhewing at the ſame time the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences we ſuffer from ſuch hired troops, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral advantages we might receive from employing thoſe of our own nation.</p>
                  <p>He further recommends this augmentation of our forces, to prevent the keeping up a ſtanding bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of them in times of peace, to enable us to make an impreſſion on the Enemy in the preſent poſture of the war, and to ſecure our ſelves againſt a Prince, who is now at the head of a powerful army, and has not yet declared himſelf.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place, he anſwers by ſeveral conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations thoſe two popular objections. That we fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh more towards the war than the reſt of the Allies, and That we are not able to contribute more than we do already.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the moſt material heads of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eſſay, in which there are many other ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate reflections that naturally grow out of ſo copious a ſubject.</p>

                  <head>THE PRESENT <hi>STATE</hi> of the <hi>WAR,</hi> AND The Neceſſity of an Augmentation, conſidered.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>French</hi> are certainly the moſt implacable, and the moſt dangerous enemies of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> nation. Their form of government, their religion, their jealouſy of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> power, as well as their proſecutions or commerce, and purſuits of univerſal Monarchy, will fix them for ever in their animoſities and averſions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and make them catch at all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of ſubverting our conſtitution, deſtroying our religion, ruining our trade, and ſinking the figure which we make among the nations of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0251102100:204"/>
                     <hi>Europe:</hi> Not to mention the particular ties of honour that lie on their preſent King to impoſe on us a Prince, who muſt prove fatal to our country if he ever reigns over us.</p>
                  <p>As we are thus in a natural ſtate of war, if I may ſo call it, with the <hi>French</hi> nation; it is our misfortune, that they are not only the moſt inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, but moſt formidable of our enemies; and have the greateſt power, as well as the ſtrongeſt inclination, to ruin us. No other ſtate equals them in the force of their fleets and armies, in the nearneſs and conveniency of their ſituation, and in the number of friends and well-wiſhers, which, it is to be feared, they have among us.</p>
                  <p>For theſe reaſons, our wars with <hi>France</hi> have always affected us in our moſt tender intereſts, and concerned us more than thoſe we have had with any other nation; but I may venture to ſay, this Kingdom was never yet engaged in a war of ſo great conſequence, as that which now lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our hands. Our All is at ſtake, and irretrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably loſt, if we fail of ſucceſs. At other times, if a war ended in a diſhonourable peace, or with equal loſs, we could comfort our ſelves with the hopes of a more favourable juncture, that might ſet the balance right, or turn it to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. We had ſtill the proſpect of forming the ſame alliance, or perhaps ſtrengthning it with new confederacies, and by that means of trying our fortune a ſecond time, in caſe the injuſtice or ambition of the enemy forced us into the field. At preſent, if we make a drawn game of it, or procure but moderate advantages, we are in a condition which every <hi>Britiſh</hi> heart muſt tremble at the thought of. There are no ſecond tryals,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0251102100:205"/>
no wars in reſerve, no new ſchemes of alliance to which we can have recourſe. Should the <hi>French</hi> King be able to bear down ſuch an united force as now makes head againſt him, at a time when <hi>Spain</hi> affords him no greater aſſiſtance; what will he do when the trade of the <hi>Levant</hi> lies at his mercy; when the whole kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> is ſupplied with his manufactures, and the wealth of the <hi>Indies</hi> flows into his coffers; and, what is yet worſe, when this additional ſtrength muſt ariſe in all its particulars from a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable decay in the States that now make war upon him? It is no wonder therefore that our late King of glorious memory, who, by the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his greateſt enemies, was a Prince that perfectly underſtood the intereſts of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſhould in his laſt ſpeech recommend to his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament the declaring war againſt <hi>France</hi> in thoſe memorable words: <hi>You have yet an opportunity, by God's bleſſing, to ſecure to you and your poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the quiet enjoyment of your religion and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if you are not wanting to your ſelves, but will exert the ancient vigour of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>nation: but I tell you plainly, my opinion is, if you do not lay hold on this occaſion, you have no reaſon to hope for another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have already a dreadful proof of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of power that accrues to <hi>France</hi> from its conjunction with <hi>Spain.</hi> So expenſive a war as that which the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy hath been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on in ſo many and ſo remote parts at once, muſt long ſince have drained and exhauſted all its ſubſtance, had there not been ſeveral ſecret ſprings, that ſwelled their treaſury from time to time, in proportion as the war has ſunk it. The King's
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0251102100:206"/>
coffers have been often reduced to the loweſt ebb, but have ſtill been ſeaſonably refreſhed by frequent and unexpected ſupplies from the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh America.</hi> We hear indeed of the arrival but of very few ſhips from thoſe parts; but as in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry veſſel there is ſtowage for immenſe treaſures, when the cargo is pure Bullion, or merchandiſe of as great a value: ſo we find by experience they have had ſuch prodigious ſums of money con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to them by theſe ſecret channels, that they have been enabled to pay more numerous armies, than they ever had on foot before; and that at a time when their trade fails in all its other branches, and is diſtreſſed by all the arts and contrivances of their neighbouring nations. During the laſt four years, by a modeſt computation, there have been brought into <hi>Breſt</hi> above ſix millions of pounds ſterling in bullion. What then ſhall we ſuppoſe wou'd be the effect of this correſpondence with <hi>America,</hi> might the wealth of thoſe parts come to them on ſquadrons of men of war, and fleets of galeons? If theſe little by-currents, that creep into the country by ſtealth, have ſo great a force, how ſhall we ſtem the whole torrent, when it breaks in upon us with its full violence? and this certainly will be our caſe, unleſs we find a means to diſſolve the union between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> I have dwelt the longer on this conſideration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the preſent war hath already furniſhed us with the experiment, and ſenſibly convinced us of the increaſe of power, which <hi>France</hi> has recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from its intercourſe with the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As there are many who look upon every thing which they do not actually ſee and feel as b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

probability and ſpeculation, I ſhall only touch on thoſe other reaſons of which we have already had ſome experience, for our preventing this coalition of intereſts and deſigns in the two monarchies.</p>
                  <p>The Woollen manufacture is the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſtrength, the ſtaple commodity and proper growth of our country; if this fails us, our trade and eſtates muſt ſink together, and all the caſh of the nation be conſumed on foreign merchandize. The <hi>French</hi> at preſent gain very much upon us in this great article of our trade, and ſince the acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> monarchy, ſupply with cloth, of their own making, the very beſt mart we had in <hi>Europe.</hi> And what a melancholy proſpect have we, if ever a peace gives them leave to enrich their manufacture with mixtures of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> wool, to multiply the hands employed in it, to improve themſelves in all the niceties of the art, and to vend their wares in thoſe places where was the greateſt conſumption of our woollen works, and the moſt conſiderable gain for the <hi>Britiſh</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant? Notwithſtanding our many ſeaſonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits from <hi>Portugal</hi> and our plantations, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready complain of our want of bullion; and muſt at laſt be reduced to the greateſt exigencies, if this great ſource be dryed up, and our traffick with <hi>Spain</hi> continue under its preſent diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The trade of the <hi>Levant</hi> muſt likewiſe flouriſh or decay in our hands, as we are friends or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> monarchy. The late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Naples</hi> will very little alter the caſe, though <hi>Sicily</hi> ſhould follow the fate of her ſiſter kingdom. The <hi>Streight</hi>'s mouth is the key of the <hi>Levant,</hi> and will be always in the poſſeſſion of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0251102100:208"/>
thoſe who are Kings of <hi>Spain.</hi> We may only add, that the ſame cauſes which ſtraiten the <hi>Britiſh</hi> commerce, will naturally enlarge the <hi>French</hi>; and that the naval force of either nation will thrive or languiſh in the ſame degree as their commerce gathers or loſes ſtrength. And if ſo powerful and populous a nation as that of <hi>France</hi> become ſuperior to us by ſea, our whole is loſt, and we are no more a people. The conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo narrow a channel betwixt us, of ſuch numbers of regular troops on the enemy's ſide, of ſo ſmall a ſtanding force on our own, and that too in a country deſtitute of all ſuch forts and ſtrong places as might ſtop the progreſs of a victorious army, hath ſomething in it ſo terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that one does not care for ſetting it in its proper light. Let it not therefore enter into the heart of any one that hath the leaſt zeal for his religion, or love of liberty, that, hath any regard either to the honour or ſafety of his country, or a well wiſh for his friends or poſterity, to think of a peace with <hi>France,</hi> till the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy be entirely torn from it, and the houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> diſabled from ever giving the law to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us ſuppoſe that the <hi>French</hi> King would grant us the moſt advantageous terms we can deſire; without the ſeparation of the two monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies they muſt infallibly end in our deſtruction. Should he ſecure to us all our preſent acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſhould he add two or three frontier-towns to what we have already in <hi>Flanders</hi>; ſhould he join the kingdoms of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Sardinia</hi> to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi>; ſhould he leave King <hi>Charles</hi> in the peaceable poſſeſſion of <hi>Catalonia</hi>; ſhould
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0251102100:209"/>
he make over to <hi>Great Britain</hi> the town and harbour of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> as well as that of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and at the ſame time reſign his conqueſts in <hi>Portugal</hi>: it would all be of no effect towards the common ſafety of <hi>Europe,</hi> while the bulk of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> continent and the riches of <hi>America</hi> remain in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Bourbon</hi> family.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Boccalini</hi> when he weighs the States of <hi>Europe</hi> in his political balance, after having laid <hi>France</hi> ill one ſcale, throws <hi>Spain</hi> into the other, which wanted but very little of being a counter-poiſe. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon this, ſays he, begun to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe themſelves the honour of the ballance; reckoning that if <hi>Spain</hi> of it ſelf weighed ſo well, they could not fail of ſucceſs when the ſeveral parts of the monarchy were lumped in the ſame ſcale. Their ſurpriſe was very great when upon the throwing in of <hi>Naples</hi> they ſaw the ſcale riſe, and was greater ſtill when they found that <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> had the ſame effect. The truth of it is, theſe parts of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> monarchy are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ornament than ſtrength. They furniſh out Vice-royalties for the Grandees, and poſts of honour for the noble families; but in a time of war are incumbrances to the main body of the kingdom, and leave it naked and expoſed by the great number of hands they draw from it to their defence. Should we therefore continue in the poſſeſſion of what we have already made our ſelves maſters, with ſuch additions as have been mentioned, we ſhould have little more than the excreſcencies of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> monarchy. The ſtrength of it will ſtill join it ſelf to <hi>France,</hi> and grow the cloſer to it by its diſunion from the reſt. And in this caſe the advantages which muſt ariſe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0251102100:210"/>
to that people from their intimate alliance with the remaining part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> dominions, would in a very few years not only repair all the damages they have ſuſtained in the preſent war, but fill the kingdom with more riches than it hath yet had in its moſt flouriſhing periods.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> King hath often entered on ſeveral expenſive projects, on purpoſe to diſſipate the wealth that is continually gathering in his coffers in times of peace. He hath employed immenſe ſums on architecture, gardening, water-works, painting, ſtatuary, and the like, to diſtribute his treaſures among his people, as well as to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour his pleaſures and his ambition; but if he once engroſſes the commerce of the <hi>Spaniſh Indies,</hi> whatever quantities of gold and ſilver ſtagnate in his private coffers, there will be ſtill enough to carry on the circulation among his ſubjects. By this means in a ſhort ſpace of time he may heap up greater wealth than all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> joined together; and in the preſent conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the world, wealth and power are but different names for the ſame thing. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſe that after eight or ten years of peace, he hath a mind to infringe any of his treaties, or invade a neighbouring State; to revive the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of <hi>Spain</hi> upon <hi>Portugal,</hi> or attempt the taking thoſe places which were granted us for our ſecurity; what reſiſtance, what oppoſition can we make to ſo formidable an enemy? Should the ſame alliance riſe againſt him that is now in war with him, what could we hope for from it, at a time when the States engaged in it will be comparatively weakened, and the enemy who is
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0251102100:211"/>
now able to keep them at a ſtand, will have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo many new acceſſions of ſtrength?</p>
                  <p>But I think it is not to be imagined that in ſuch a conjuncture as we here ſuppoſe, the ſame confederates, or any other of equal force, could be prevailed upon to join their arms, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at the pulling down ſo exorbitant a power. Some might be bought into his intereſts by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, others drawn over by fear, and thoſe that are liable to neither of theſe impreſſions, might not think their own intereſt ſo much concerned as in the preſent war; or if any appeared in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to enter into ſuch a confederacy, they might be cruſhed ſeparately before they could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert meaſures for their mutual defence.</p>
                  <p>The keeping together of the preſent alliance can be aſcribed to nothing elſe but the clear and evident conviction which every member of it is under, that if it ſhould once break without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had its effect, they can never hope for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opportunity of reuniting, or of prevailing by all the joint efforts of ſuch an union. Let us therefore agree on this as a fixt rule, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable maxim, never to lay down our arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>France,</hi> till we have utterly disjoined her from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> monarchy. Let this be the firſt ſtep of a publick treaty, the baſis of a general peace.</p>
                  <p>Had the preſent war indeed run againſt us, and all our attacks upon the enemy been vain, it might look like a degree of frenzy, or a mixture of obſtinacy and deſpair, to be determined on ſo impracticable an undertaking. But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we have already done a great part of our work, and are come within view of the end that we
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0251102100:212"/>
have been ſo long driving at. We remain victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in all the ſeats of war. In <hi>Flanders</hi> we have got into our hands ſeveral open countries, rich towns, and fortified places. We have dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the enemy out of all his alliances, diſpoſſeſſed him of his ſtrong holds, and ruined his allies in <hi>Germany.</hi> We have not only recovered what the beginning of the war had taken from us, but poſſeſſed ourſelves of the kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> the dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the avenue of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly.</hi> The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> war hath given us a haven for our ſhips, and the moſt populous and wealthy province of that kingdom. In ſhort, we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all the outlying parts of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and made impreſſions upon the very heart of it. We have beaten the <hi>French</hi> from all their advanced poſts in <hi>Europe,</hi> and driven them into their laſt entrenchments. One vigorous puſh on all ſides, one general aſſault will force the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to cry out for quarter, and ſurrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at diſcretion. Another <hi>Blenheim</hi> or <hi>Ramil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> will make the confederates maſters of their own terms, and arbitrators of a peace.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding the advantages already gained are very conſiderable if we purſue them, they will be of no effect unleſs we improve them towards the carrying of our main point. The enemy ſtaggers; if you follow your blow, he falls at your feet; but if you allow him reſpite, he will recover his ſtrength, and come upon you with greater fury. We have given him ſeveral repeated wounds that have enfeebled him, and brought him low; but they are ſuch as time will heal, unleſs you take advantage from his preſent weakneſs to redouble your attacks upon him.

It was a celebrated part in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s character, and what comes home to our preſent purpoſe, that he thought nothing at all was done, while any thing remained undone. In ſhort, we have been tugging a great while againſt the ſtream, and have almoſt weathered our point; a ſtretch or two more will do the work; but if inſtead of that we ſlacken our arms, and drop our oars, we ſhall be hurried back in a moment to the place from whence we firſt ſet out.</p>
                  <p>After having ſeen the neceſſity of an entire ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the kingdoms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> our ſubject naturally leads us into the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moſt proper means for effecting it.</p>
                  <p>We have a great while flattered our ſelves with the proſpect of reducing <hi>France</hi> to our own terms by the want of money among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the exigencies of the publick treaſury; but have been ſtill diſappointed by the great ſums imported from <hi>America,</hi> and the many new expedients which the Court hath found out for its relief. A long conſumptive war is more likely to break the grand alliance, than diſable <hi>France</hi> from maintaining ſufficient armies to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it. An arbitrary government will never want money ſo long as the people have it; and ſo active a people will always have it, whilſt they can ſend what merchandiſes they pleaſe to <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> ſince their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with <hi>Spain</hi> keep thirty ſhips in conſtant motion between the weſtern ports of <hi>France</hi> and the ſouth ſeas of <hi>America.</hi> The King himſelf is an adventurer in this traffick, and beſides the ſhare that he receives out of the gains of his ſubjects, has immenſe ſums that come directly from it into his own hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0251102100:214"/>We may further conſider, that the <hi>French</hi> ſince their abandoning <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> have very much retrenched the expence of the war, and lay out among themſelves all the money that is conſumed in it.</p>
                  <p>Many are of opinion, that the moſt probable way of bringing <hi>France</hi> to reaſon would be by the making an attempt upon the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies,</hi> and by that means to cut off all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with this great ſource of riches, or turn the current of it into our own country. This I muſt confeſs carries ſo promiſing an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that I would by no means diſcourage the attempt: but at the ſame time I think it ſhould be a collateral project rather than our principal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Such an undertaking (if well concerted, and put into good hands) would be of infinite advantage to the common cauſe: but certainly an enterpriſe that carries in it the fate of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſhould not turn upon the uncertainty of winds and waves, and be liable to all the accidents that may befal a naval expedition.</p>
                  <p>Others there are that have long deceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the hopes of an inſurrection in <hi>France,</hi> and are therefore for laying out all our ſtrength on a deſcent. Theſe, I think, do not enough conſider the natural love which the groſs of mankind have for the conſtitution of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. A man that is not enlightened by travel or reflexion, grows as fond of arbitrary power, to which he hath been uſed from his infancy, as of cold climates, or barren countries in which he hath been born and bred. Beſides, there is a kind of ſluggiſh reſignation, as well as poorneſs and degeneracy of ſpirit, in a ſtate of ſlavery,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0251102100:215"/>
that we meet with but very few who will be at the pains or danger of recovering themſelves out of it; as we find in hiſtory inſtances of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who after their priſons have been flung open, and their fetters ſtruck off, have choſen rather to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh in their dungeons, than ſtake their miſerable lives and fortunes upon the ſucceſs of a revolution. I need not inſtance the general fate of deſcents, the difficulty of ſupplying men and proviſions by ſea againſt an enemy that hath both at hand, and without which it is impoſſible to ſecure thoſe conqueſts that are often made in the firſt onſets of an invaſion. For theſe and other reaſons I can never approve the nurſing up commotions and inſurrections in the enemy's country, which for want of the neceſſary ſupport are likely to end in the maſſacre of our friends and the ruin of their families.</p>
                  <p>The only means therefore for bringing <hi>France</hi> to our conditions, and what appears to me, in all human probability, a ſure and infallible expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, is to throw in multitudes upon them, and overpower them with numbers. Would the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy exert it ſelf as much to annoy the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as they themſelves do for their defence, we might bear them down with the weight of our armies, and in one ſummer overſet the whole power of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> monarchy is already exhauſted of its beſt and braveſt ſubjects. The flower of the nation is conſumed in its wars: the ſtrength of their armies conſiſts at preſent of ſuch as have ſaved themſelves by flight from ſome or other of the victorious confederates; and the only proper perſons to recruit them are but the refuſe of thoſe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0251102100:216"/>
who have been already picked out for the ſervice. Mareſchal <hi>de Vauban,</hi> though infinitely partial in his calculations of the power of <hi>France,</hi> reckons that the number of its inhabitants was two mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions leſs at the peace of <hi>Ryſwick,</hi> than in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the war that was there concluded: and though that war continued nine years, and this hath as yet laſted but ſix, yet conſidering that their armies are more ſtrong and numerous; that there hath been much more action in the preſent war; and that their loſſes ſuſtained in it have been very extraordinary; we may, by a moderate computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuppoſe that the preſent war hath not been leſs prejudicial than the foregoing one in the ravage which it has made among the people. There is in <hi>France</hi> ſo great a diſproportion between the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of males and females; and among the former, between thoſe who are capable of bearing arms, and ſuch as are too young, ſickly, or decrepit for the ſervice; and at the ſame time ſuch vaſt numbers of Eccleſiaſticks, ſecular and religious, who live upon the labours of others, that when the ſeveral trades and profeſſions are ſupplied, you will find moſt of thoſe that are proper for war abſolutely neceſſary for filling up the laborious part of life, and carrying on the underwork of the nation. They have already contributed all their ſuperfluous hands, and every new levy they make muſt be at the expence of their farms and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, their manufactures and commerce.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, the grand Alliance have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ſources of recruits, not only in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>; but in all the populous parts of <hi>Germany</hi> that have little trade or manufactures, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0251102100:217"/>
to the number of their inhabitants. We may add, that the <hi>French</hi> have only <hi>Switzerland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their own country, to recruit in; and we know the difficulties they meet with in getting thence a ſingle regiment: whereas the Allies have not only the ſame reſource, but may be ſupplied for money from <hi>Denmark</hi> and other neutral States. In ſhort, the Confederates may bring to the field what forces they pleaſe, if they will be at the charge of them: but <hi>France,</hi> let her wealth be what it will, muſt content herſelf with the product of her own country.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> are ſtill in greater ſtreights for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of horſe than men. The breed of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is neither ſo good nor numerous as what are to be found in moſt of the countries of the Allies. They had laſt ſummer about threeſcore thouſand in their ſeveral armies, and could not perhaps bring into the field thirty thouſand more, if they were diſpoſed to make ſuch an augmentation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> horſe are not only few, but weak in compariſon of ours. Their cavalry in the battle of <hi>Blenheim</hi> could not ſuſtain the ſhock of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> horſe. For this reaſon our late way of attacking their troops ſword in hand is very much to the advantage of our nation, as our men are more robuſt, and our horſes of a ſtronger make than the <hi>French</hi>; and in ſuch attacks it is the weight of the forces, ſuppoſing equal courage and conduct, that will always carry it. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtrength turned very much to account in our wars againſt the <hi>French</hi> of old, when we uſed to gall them with our long bows, at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance than they could ſhoot their arrows: this advantage we loſt upon the invention of fire-arms,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0251102100:218"/>
but by the preſent method our ſtrength as well as bravery may again be of uſe to us in the day of battle.</p>
                  <p>We have very great encouragement to ſend what numbers we are able into the field, becauſe our Generals at preſent are ſuch as are likely to make the beſt uſe of them, without throwing them away on any freſh attempts or ill-concert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed projects. The Confederate armies have the happineſs of being commanded by perſons who are eſteemed the greateſt leaders of the preſent age, and are perhaps equal to any that have prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them. There is a ſort of reſemblance in their characters; a particular ſedateneſs in their converſation and behaviour, that qualifies them for council, with a great intrepidity and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that fits them for action. They are all of them men of concealed fire, that doth not break out with noiſe and heat in the ordinary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of life; but ſhews it ſelf ſufficiently in all great enterpriſes that require it. It is true, the General upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> hath not had the ſame occaſions as the others to ſignalize himſelf; but if we conſider the great vigilance, activity and courage, with the conſummate prudence, and the nice ſenſe of honour which appears in that Prince's character, we have great reaſon to hope, that as he purchaſed the firſt ſucceſs in the preſent war, by forcing into the ſervice of the Confederates an army that was raiſed againſt them in the very heart of the Empire, he will give one of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſtrokes to it, and help to conclude the great work which he ſo happily begun. The ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den check that he gave to the <hi>French</hi> army the laſt campaign, and the good order he eſtabliſhed
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0251102100:219"/>
in that of the <hi>Germans,</hi> look like happy preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of what we may expect from his conduct. I ſhall not pretend to give any character of the Generals on the enemies ſide; but I think we may ſay this, that in the eyes of their own nation they are inferior to ſeveral that have formerly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>French</hi> armies. If then we have greater numbers than the <hi>French,</hi> and at the ſame time better Generals, it muſt be our own fault if we will not reap the fruit of ſuch advantages.</p>
                  <p>It would be loſs of time to explain any farther our ſuperiority to the enemy in numbers of men and horſe. We ſee plainly that we have the means in our hands, and that nothing but the application of them is wanting. Let us only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what uſe the enemy would make of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage we have mentioned, if it fell on their ſide; and is it not very ſtrange that we ſhould not be as active and induſtrious for our ſecurity, as they would certainly be for our deſtruction? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we conſider more diſtinctly the method we ought to take in the proſecution of the war, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this particular view, let us reflect a little upon thoſe we have already taken in the courſe of it for theſe ſix years paſt.</p>
                  <p>The Allies after a ſucceſsful ſummer are too apt, upon the ſtrength of it, to neglect their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for the enſuing campaign, while the <hi>French</hi> leave no art nor ſtratagem untried to fill up the empty ſpaces of their armies, and ſwell them to an equal bulk with thoſe of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. By this means our advantage is loſt, and the fate of <hi>Europe</hi> brought to a ſecond deciſion. It is now become an obſervation, that we are to expect a very indifferent year after a very ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0251102100:220"/>
one. <hi>Blenheim</hi> was followed by a ſummer that makes no noiſe in the war. <hi>Ramillies, Turin,</hi> and <hi>Barcelona,</hi> were the parents of our laſt cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign. So many dreadful blows alarmed the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and raiſed their whole country up in arms. Had we on our ſide made proportionable prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the war by this time had been brought to a happy iſſue. If after having gained the great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories of <hi>Blenheim</hi> and <hi>Ramillies,</hi> we had made the ſame efforts as we ſhould have done had we loſt them, the power of <hi>France</hi> could not have withſtood us.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the winter we uſually get what intelligence we can of the force which the enemy intends to employ in the campaigns of the ſucceeding year, and immediately caſt about for a ſufficient number of troops to face them in the field of battle. This, I muſt confeſs, would be a good method if we were engaged in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive war. We might maintain our ground with an equal number of forces; but our buſineſs is not only to ſecure what we are already in poſſeſſion of; we are to wreſt the whole <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy out of the hands of the enemy; and in order to it, to work our way into the heart of his country by dint of arms. We ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put forth all our ſtrength, and without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eye to his preparations, make the greateſt puſh that we are able on our own ſide. We are told that the enemy at preſent thinks of raiſing threeſcore thouſand men for the next ſummer; if we regulate our levies in that view, we do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; let us perform our utmoſt, as they do, and we ſhall overwhelm them with our multitudes. We have it in our power at leaſt to be four times
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0251102100:221"/>
as ſtrong as the <hi>French,</hi> but if ten men are in war with forty, and the latter detach only an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual number to the engagement, what benefit do they receive from their ſuperiority?</p>
                  <p>It ſeems therefore to be the buſineſs of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates to turn to their advantage their apparent odds in men and horſe; and by that means to out-number the enemy in all rencounters and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements. For the ſame reaſon it muſt be for the intereſt of the Allies to ſeek all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of battle, becauſe all loſſes on the oppoſite ſide are made up with infinitely more difficulty than on ours; beſides that the <hi>French</hi> do their buſineſs by lying ſtill, and have no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in the war than to hold faſt what they have already got into their hands.</p>
                  <p>The miſcarriage of the nobleſt project that ever was formed in <hi>Europe,</hi> can be aſcribed to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but our want of numbers in the ſeveral quarters of the war. If our armies on all ſides had begun to buſy and inſult the enemy, at the ſame time that the forces marched out of <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, Toulon</hi> had been at preſent in the hands of the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> But could that Prince ever have imagined that the <hi>French</hi> would have been at liberty to detach whole armies againſt him? or will it appear credible to poſterity, that in a war carried on by the joint force of ſo many populous and powerful nations, <hi>France</hi> could ſend ſo great a part of its troops to one ſeat of the war, without ſuffering in any of the reſt? Whereas it is well known, that if the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had continued before <hi>Toulon</hi> eight days longer, he had been attacked by an army of ſixty thouſand men, which was more than double the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0251102100:222"/>
number of his own; and yet the enemy was ſtrong enough every where elſe to prevent the Confederates from making any impreſſion upon them. However, let us fall into the right mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and we may hope that the ſtroke is only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> hath ſecured a paſſage into <hi>Dauphiny,</hi> and if the Allies make ſuch efforts in all parts, as we may reaſonably expect from them, that Prince may ſtill make himſelf Maſter of the <hi>French</hi> dominions on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is another part of our conduct which may perhaps deſerve to be conſidered. As ſoon as we have agreed with the States-General upon any augmentation of our forces, we immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly negotiate with ſome or other of the <hi>German</hi> Princes, who are in the ſame confederacy, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh out our quota in Mercenaries. This may be doubly prejudicial to the alliance; Firſt, as it may have an ill influence on the reſolutions of thoſe Princes in the Diet of the Empire, who may be willing to ſettle as ſmall a quota as they can for themſelves, that they may have more troops to hire out; and in the next place, as it may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from contributing the whole quota which they have ſettled This actually happened in the laſt campaign, when we are told the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> excuſed themſelves for their want of troops upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> as having already put moſt of their forces into the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> ſervice. Such an excuſe, indeed, is very unjuſt, but it would be better to give them no occaſion of making it; and on ſuch occaſions to conſider what men are apt to do, as well as what they may do with reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0251102100:223"/>It might therefore be for our advantage that all the foreign troops in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> pay ſhould be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in neutral countries. <hi>Switzerland</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, if timely applied to, might be of great uſe to us; no only in reſpect of the reinforcements which we might draw from thence, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a draught of forces would leſſen the number of thoſe that might otherwiſe be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>French</hi> ſervice. The bulk of our levies ſhould nevertheleſs be raiſed in our own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it being impoſſible for neutral States to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh both the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> with a ſufficient number of effective men; beſides that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſoldiers will be more at the diſpoſal of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and act with greater vigour under the conduct of one for whom they have ſo juſt a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and whom they do not conſider only as their leader, but as their country-man. We may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſuppoſe that the ſoldiers of a neutral ſtate, who are not animated by any national intereſt, cannot fight for pay with the ſame ardour and alacrity, as men that fight for their Prince and country, their wives and children.</p>
                  <p>It may likewiſe be worth while to conſider whether the military Genius of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation may not fall by degrees, and become inferior to that of our neighbouring ſtates, if it hath no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to exert it ſelf. Minds that are altogether ſet on trade and profit, often contract a certain narrowneſs of temper, and at length become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of great and generous reſolutions. Should the <hi>French</hi> ever make an unexpected de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent upon us, we might want ſoldiers of our own growth to riſe up in our defence; and might not have time to draw a ſufficient number of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0251102100:224"/>
troops to our relief from the remote corners of <hi>Germany.</hi> It is generally ſaid, that if King <hi>Charles</hi> II. had made war upon <hi>France</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his reign, he might have conquered it by the many veterans which were ſcattered up and down this kingdom, and had been inured to ſervice in the civil wars. It is to be hoped we ſhall never have ſuch another nurſery of ſoldiers; but if the preſent war gives a more military turn to all other nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> than to our own, it is to be feared we may loſe in ſtrength, what we gain in number. We may apply the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration nearer home. If all our levies are made in <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> may not thoſe two parts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> monarchy, after the disbanding of the preſent army, be too powerful for the reſt, in caſe of a revolt? though, God be thanked, we are not in any danger of one at preſent. However, as theſe conſiderations do not concern the more eſſential part of our deſign, it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to have mentioned them.</p>
                  <p>The ſparing of our ſelves in ſo important a conjuncture, when we have but this ſingle op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity left for the preſerving every thing that is precious amongſt us, is the worſt ſort of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement that we can poſſibly fall into. The good husbandry of one age may intail an endleſs expence upon all poſterity. We muſt venture the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing a part of our lives and fortunes at preſent, if we will effectually ſecure both for the future. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kingdom is ſo well ſtock'd with people, and ſo much abounds in horſe, that we have power enough in our own hands, did we make our outmoſt uſe of it, to humble <hi>France,</hi> and in a campaign or two to put an end to the war.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:0251102100:225"/>There is not a more diſagreeable thought to the people of <hi>Great Britain</hi> than that of a ſtanding ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But if a peace be made before the diſunion of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> there are few, perhaps, that will not think the maintaining a ſettled body of numerous forces indiſpenſable for the ſafety of our country. We have it therefore in our choice to raiſe ſuch a ſtrong reinforcement of troops as at preſent may be ſufficient, in conjunction with thoſe of the allies, for breaking the ſtrength of the enemy; or when the peace is concluded, to keep on foot ſuch an army as will be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for preventing his attempts upon us.</p>
                  <p>It is to be hoped that thoſe who would be the moſt zealous againſt keeping up a conſtant body of regular troops after a general peace, will the moſt diſtinguiſh themſelves for the promoting an augmentation of thoſe which are now on foot; and by that means take care that we ſhall not ſtand in need of ſuch an expedient.</p>
                  <p>We are indeed obliged by the preſent ſituation of our affairs to bring more troops into the field than we have yet done. As the <hi>French</hi> are retired within their lines, and have collected all their ſtrength into a narrow compaſs, we muſt have greater numbers to charge them in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, and force them to a battle. We ſaw the laſt campaign that an army of fourſcore thouſand of the beſt troops in <hi>Europe,</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi> at the head of them, could do nothing againſt an enemy that were too nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to be aſſaulted in their camps, or attacked in their ſtrong holds.</p>
                  <p>There is another conſideration which deſerves our utmoſt attention. We know very well,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0251102100:226"/>
that there is a Prince at the head of a powerful ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who may give a turn to the war, in which we are engaged, if he thinks fit to ſide with either party. I cannot preſume to gueſs how far our miniſters may be informed of his deſigns: but unleſs they have very ſtrong aſſurances of his falling in with the grand alliance, or not oppoſing it, they cannot be too circumſpect and ſpeedy in taking their precautions againſt any contrary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. We ſhall be unpardonable, if after ſuch an expence of blood and treaſure, we leave it in the power of any ſingle Prince to command a peace, and make us accept what conditions he thinks fit. It is certain, according to the poſture of our affairs in the laſt campaign, this Prince could have turn'd the ballance on either ſide; but it is to be hoped the liberties of <hi>Europe</hi> will not depend any more on the determination of one man's will. I do not ſpeak this becauſe I think there is any appearance of that Prince's uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf to <hi>France.</hi> On the contrary, as he hath an extraordinary zeal for the reformed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and great ſentiments of honour, I think it is not improbable we ſhould draw him over to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, if we preſs him to it by proper motives. His love for religion, and his ſenſe of glory, will both have their effect on a Prince who hath already diſtinguiſhed himſelf by being a patron of proteſtants, and guarantee of the <hi>Weſtphalian</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And if his intereſt hath any part in his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the allies may make him greater offers than the <hi>French</hi> King can do in the preſent conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. There are large extents of dominion in the forfeited principalities of the Empire; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſucceſſions, to which the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſeems
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0251102100:227"/>
to have very juſt pretenſions; and at the ſame time a great title not yet diſpoſed of, and a ſeat of war on the <hi>Moſelle,</hi> where none of our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals have ſignalized themſelves. It would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to be particular in any propoſals on ſuch an occaſion; it is enough to have ſhewn in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that there are fair opportunities, of which the wiſdom of the confederates may make uſe.</p>
                  <p>Common ſenſe will direct us, when we ſee ſo warlike a prince at the head of ſo great an army <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hovering on the borders of our confederates, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to obtain his friendſhip, or ſecure our ſelves againſt the force of his arms. We are ſure, whatever numbers of troops we raiſe, we ſhall have no hands but what will turn to account. Nay, we are certain, that extraordinary funds and augmentations for one or two campaigns may ſpare us the expence of many years, and put an end to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>axes and levies for a whole age; whereas a long parſimonious war will drain us of more men and money, and in the end may prove inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.</p>
                  <p>There is ſtill a great popular objection, which will be made to every thing that can be urged on this ſubject. And indeed it is ſuch a one as falls ſo much in with the prejudices and little paſſions of the multitude, that when it is turned and ſet off to advantage by ill-deſigning men, it throws a damp on the publick ſpirit of the nation, and gives a check to all generous reſolutions for its honour and ſafety. In ſhort, we are to be told, that <hi>England</hi> contributes much more than any other of the Allies, and that therefore it is not reaſonable ſhe ſhould make any addition to her preſent efforts. If this were true in fact, I do
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0251102100:228"/>
not ſee any tolerable colour for ſuch a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Suppoſing among a multitude embarqued in the ſame veſſel, there are ſeveral that in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a tempeſt will rather periſh than work for their preſervation; would it not be madneſs in the reſt to ſtand idle, and rather chuſe to ſink toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than do more than comes to their ſhare? Since we are engaged in a work ſo abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for our welfare, the remiſsneſs of our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ſhould be an argument for us to redouble our endeavours rather than ſlacken them. If we muſt govern our ſelves by example, let us rather imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the vigilance and activity of the common enemy, than the ſupineneſs and negligence of our friends.</p>
                  <p>We have indeed a much greater ſhare in the war than any other part of the confederacy. The <hi>French</hi> King makes at us directly, keeps a King by him to ſet over us, and hath very lately aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the ſalary of his court, to let us ſee how much he hath that deſign at his heart. Few of the nations in war with him, ſhould they ever fall into his hands, would loſe their religion or form of government, or interfere at preſent with him in matters of commerce. The <hi>Dutch,</hi> who are likely to be the greateſt loſers after the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> have but little trade to the <hi>Levant</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with ours, have no conſiderable planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or commerce in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> or any woollen-manufactures for <hi>Spain</hi>; not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ſtrong barrier they have already purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between <hi>France</hi> and their own country.</p>
                  <p>But after all, every nation in the confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy makes the ſame complaint, and fancies it ſelf the greateſt ſufferer by the war. Indeed in
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0251102100:229"/>
to common a preſſure, let the weight be never ſo equally diſtributed, every one will be moſt ſenſible of that part which lies on his own ſhoulders. We furniſh, without diſpute, more than any other branch of the Alliance: but the queſtion is, whether others do not exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in proportion according to their reſpective ſtrength. The Emperor, the King of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Hanover,</hi> as well as the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſeem at leaſt to come up to us. The greateſt powers in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> are borrowing mony where they can get it, in order to maintain their ſtated Quota's, and go thorough their part of the expence: and if any of the Circles have been negligent, they have paid for it much more in their late contributions, than what would have furniſhed out their ſhares in the common charges of the war.</p>
                  <p>There are others who will object the poverty of the nation, and the difficulties it would find in furniſhing greater ſupplies to the war than it doth at preſent. To this we might anſwer, that if the nation were really as poor as this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection makes it, it ſhould be an argument for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing rather than diminiſhing our preſent efforts againſt <hi>France.</hi> The ſinking our taxes for a few years would be only a temporary relief, and in a little time occaſion far greater impoſitions, than thoſe which are now laid upon us. Whereas the ſeaſonable expence of part of our riches, will not only preſerve the reſt; but by the right uſe of them procure vaſt additions to our preſent ſtock. It may be neceſſary for a perſon lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing under an ill habit of body to loſe ſeveral ounces of blood, notwithſtanding it will weaken
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0251102100:230"/>
him for a time, in order to put a new ferment into the remaining maſs, and draw into it freſh ſupplies.</p>
                  <p>But we can by no means make this conceſſion, to thoſe who ſo induſtriouſly publiſh the nation's poverty. Our country is not only rich, but abounds in wealth much more than any other of the ſame extent in <hi>Europe. France,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the goodneſs of its climate, the fertility of its ſoil, the multitude of its inhabitants, its convenient harbours, both for the <hi>Ocean</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean,</hi> and its preſent correſpondence with the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> is not to compare with <hi>Great Britain</hi> in this particular. I ſhall tranſcribe word for word the paſſage of a late celebrated <hi>French</hi> Author, which will lay this matter in its full light; and leave the Reader to make the counter-part of the parallel between the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="margQuotes">According to all the inquiries that I have been able to make during ſeveral years, in which I have applied my ſelf to this ſort of remarks, I have obſerved, that about a tenth part of the people of this kingdom are reduced to begga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and are actual beggars. That among the nine other parts, five are not in a condition to give alms or relief to thoſe aforementioned, being very near reduced themſelves to the ſame miſerable condition. Of the four other remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts, three are very uneaſy in their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and embarraſſed with debts and law-ſuits. In the tenth part, I reckon the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, Lawyers, Eccleſiaſticks, Merchants and ſubſtantial Citizens, which cannot make up more than a hundred thouſand families. And
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0251102100:231"/>
I believe I ſhould not be miſtaken, if I ſhould ſay, that there are not above ten thouſand of theſe families, who are very much at their eaſe: and if out of theſe ten thouſand we ſhould take the men that are employed in publick buſineſs, with their dependents and adherents, as alſo thoſe whom the King ſupports by his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with a few Merchants, the number of thoſe who remain will be ſurprizingly little.</q>
                     <hi>Dixme Royale.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What a dreadful account is this of nineteen millions of people; for ſo many the author rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons in that kingdom. How can we ſee ſuch a multitude of ſouls caſt under ſo many ſubdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of miſery, without reflecting on the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of a form of government that ſacrifices the eaſe and happineſs of ſo many reaſonable Beings to the glory of one of their fellow-creatures? But this is not our affair at preſent.</p>
                  <p>If we run over the other nations of <hi>Europe</hi> that have any part in the preſent war, we ſhall only paſs through ſo many different ſcenes of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. <hi>Spain, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> are reduced to great extremities. <hi>Germany</hi> is exhauſted to the laſt degree in many parts of it, and in others plundered of all ſhe had left. <hi>Holland</hi> indeed flouriſhes above the reſt in wealth and plenty: but if we conſider the infinite induſtry and penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs of that people, the coarſeneſs of their food and raiment, their little indulgences of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and exceſs, it is no wonder that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they furniſh as great taxes as their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they make a better figure under them. In a common wealth there are not ſo many over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown eſtates as in monarchies, the wealth of the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0251102100:232"/>
country is ſo equally diſtributed, that moſt of the community are at their eaſe, though few are placed in extraordinary points of ſplendor and magnificence. But notwithſtanding theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances may very much contribute to the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proſperity of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> we know they are indebted many millions more than their whole republick is worth, and if we conſider the variety of taxes and impoſitions they groan under at a time when their private diſſentions run high, and ſome of the wealthieſt parts of the government refuſe to bear their ſhare in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick expence, we ſhall not think the condition of that people ſo much to be envied as ſome amongſt us would willingly repreſent it.</p>
                  <p>Nor is <hi>Great Britain</hi> only rich as ſhe ſtands in compariſon with other States, but is really ſo in her own intrinſick wealth. She had never more ſhips at ſea, greater quantities of merchandiſe in her warehouſes, larger receipts of cuſtoms, or more numerous commodities riſing out of her manufactures than ſhe has at preſent. In ſhort, ſhe ſits in the midſt of a mighty affluence of all the neceſſaries and conveniences of life. If our ſilver and gold diminiſhes, our publick credit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues unimpaired, and if we are in want of bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, it lies in our own power to ſupply our ſelves. The old <hi>Roman</hi> General, when he heard his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my complain of thirſt, ſhewed them the ſprings and rivers that lay behind the enemy's camp. It is our own caſe: the rout of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> army would make us maſters of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> takes upon him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the confederate forces in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and meets with that ſupport from the alliance
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0251102100:233"/>
which they are capable of giving him, we have a fair proſpect of reducing <hi>Spain</hi> to the entire obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> The <hi>Sileſian</hi> fund (to the immortal reputation of thoſe generous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots who were concerned in it) enabled that Prince to make a conqueſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> at a time when our affairs were more deſperate there, than they are at preſent in the kingdom of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When our Parliament has done their utmoſt, another publick-ſpirited project of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which the common enemy could not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee nor prepare againſt, might in all probability ſet King <hi>Charles</hi> upon the throne for which he hath ſo long contended. One pitched battle would determine the fate of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> continent.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore exert the united ſtrength of our whole Iſland, and by that means put a new life and ſpirit into the confederates, who have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We ſee the neceſſity of an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation if we intend to bring the enemy to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or reſcue our country from the miſeries that may befall it; and we find our ſelves in a condition of making ſuch an augmentation as, by the bleſſing of God, cannot but prove effectual. If we carry it on vigorouſly, we ſhall gain for our ſelves and our poſterity a long, a glorious and a laſting peace; but if we neglect ſo fair an opportunity, we may be willing to employ all our hands, and all our treaſures, when it will be too late; and ſhall be tormented with one of the moſt melancholy reflexions of an afflicted heart, That it was once in our power to have made our ſelves and our children happy.</p>

Secondly, I ſhall take notice of <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Authors in the ſame light.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. There are many reaſons, why you ſhould not expect that matters of ſuch a wonderful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould be taken notice of by thoſe eminent <hi>Pagan</hi> writers, who were contemporaries with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or by thoſe who lived before his Diſciples had perſonally appeared among them, and aſcertained the report which had gone abroad concerning a life ſo full of miracles.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſing ſuch things had happened at this day in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> or among the <hi>Griſons,</hi> who make a gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such kinds of news, though never ſo true, ſeldom gain credit, till ſome time after they are tranſacted and expoſed to the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the curious, who by laying together cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, atteſtations, and characters of thoſe who are concerned in them, either receive or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject what at firſt none but eye-witneſſes could ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0251102100:237"/>
believe or disbelieve. In a caſe of this ſort, it was natural for men of ſenſe and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to treat the whole account as fabulous, or at fartheſt to ſuſpend their belief of it, until all things ſtood together in their full light.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Beſides, the <hi>Jews</hi> were branded not only for ſuperſtitions different from all the religions of the <hi>Pagan</hi> world, but in a particular manner ridiculed for being a credulous people; ſo that whatever reports of ſuch a nature came out of that country, were looked upon by the heathen world as falſe, frivolous, and improbable.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. We may further obſerve that the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry practice of Magic in thoſe times, with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretended Prodigies, Divinations, Apparitions, and local Miracles among the Heathens, made them leſs attentive to ſuch news from <hi>Judaea,</hi> till they had time to conſider the nature, the occaſion, and the end of our Saviour's miracles, and were awakened by many ſurprizing events to allow them any conſideration at all.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. We are indeed told by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> that the fame of our Saviour, during his life, went throughout all <hi>Syria,</hi> and that there followed him great multitudes of people from <hi>Galilee, Judaea, Decapolis, Idumaea,</hi> from beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> and from <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon.</hi> Now had there been any hiſtorians of thoſe times and places, we might have expected to have ſeen in them ſome account of thoſe wonderful tranſactions in <hi>Judaea</hi>; but there is not any ſingle Author extant, in any kind, of that age, in any of thoſe countries.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. How many books have periſhed in which poſſibly there might have been mention of our Saviour? Look among the <hi>Romans,</hi> how few of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0251102100:238"/>
their writings are come down to our times? In the ſpace of two hundred years from our Saviour's birth, when there was ſuch a multitude of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in all kinds, how ſmall is the number of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that have made their way to the preſent age?</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. One authentick Record, and that the moſt authentick heathen Record, we are pretty ſure is loſt. I mean the account ſent by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Judaea,</hi> under whom our Saviour was judged, condemned, and crucified. It was the cuſtom in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as it is to this day in all the governments of the world, for the praefects and vice-roys of diſtant provinces to tranſmit to their Soveraign a ſummary relation of every thing remarkable in their adminiſtration. That <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> in his account, would have touched on ſo extraordinary an event in <hi>Judaea,</hi> is not to be doubted; and that he actually did, we learn from <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who lived about a hundred years after our Saviour's death, reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, made Converts, and ſuffered martyrdom at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was engaged with Philoſophers, and in a particular manner with <hi>Creſcens</hi> the <hi>Cynick,</hi> who could eaſily have detected, and would not fail to have expoſed him, had he quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Record not in being, or made any falſe cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of it. Would the great Apologiſt have challenged <hi>Creſcens</hi> to diſpute the cauſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity with him before the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, had he forged ſuch an evidence? or would <hi>Creſcens</hi> have refuſed the challenge, could he have trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed over him in the detection of ſuch a forgery? To which we muſt add, that the Apology, which appeals to this Record, was preſented to a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Emperor, and to the whole body of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:0251102100:239"/>
Senate. This father in his apology, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the death and ſuffering of our Saviour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the Emperor for the truth of what he ſays to the acts of <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> which I have here mentioned. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who wrote his Apology about fifty years after <hi>Juſtin,</hi> doubtleſs referred to the ſame Record, when he tells the Governor of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Emperor <hi>Tiberius</hi> having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an account out of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> of the Divine perſon who had appeared in that country, paid him a particular regard, and threatned to puniſh any who ſhould accuſe the chriſtians; nay, that the Emperor would have adopted him among the Deities whom they worſhipped, had not the Senate refuſed to come into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who gives us this hiſtory, was not only one of the moſt learned men of his age, but, what adds a greater weight to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in this caſe, was eminently skilful and well read in the laws of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Nor can it be ſaid, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> grounded his quotation upon the authority of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we find he mixes it with matters of fact which are not related by that Author. <hi>Euſebius</hi> mentions the ſame ancient Record, but as it was not extant in his time, I ſhall not inſiſt upon his authority in this point. If it be objected that this particular is not mentioned in any <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorian, I ſhall uſe the ſame argument in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel caſe, and ſee whether it will carry any force with it. <hi>Ulpian</hi> the great <hi>Roman</hi> Lawyer gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together all the Imperial Edicts that had been made againſt the chriſtians. But did any one ever ſay that there had been no ſuch Edicts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not mentioned in the hiſtories of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0251102100:240"/>
thoſe Emperors? Beſides, who knows but this circumſtance of <hi>Tiberius</hi> was mentioned in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hiſtorians that have been loſt, though not to be found in any ſtill extant? Has not <hi>Suetoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> many particulars of this Emperor omitted by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and <hi>Herodian</hi> many that are not ſo much as hinted at by either? As for the ſpurious <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Pilate,</hi> now extant, we know the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and time of their writing, and that had there not been a true and authentick Record of this nature, they would never have been forged.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. The ſtory of <hi>Agbarus</hi> King of <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> relating to the letter which he ſent to our Saviour, and to that which he received from him, is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of great authority; and though I will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon it, may venture to ſay, that had we ſuch an evidence for any fact in <hi>Pagan</hi> hiſtory, an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would be thought very unreaſonable who ſhould reject it. I believe you will be of my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, if you will peruſe, with other Authors, who have appeared in vindication of theſe letters as genuine, the additional arguments which have been made uſe of by the late famous and learned Dr. <hi>Grabe,</hi> in the ſecond volume of his <hi>Spicile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium.</hi>

                  <p n="2">II. Such particulars are moſt of theſe which follow, and which are all atteſted by ſome one or other of thoſe heathen Authors, who lived in or near the age of our Saviour and his diſciples. <hi>That</hi> Auguſtus Caeſar <hi>had ordered the whole em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to be cenſed or taxed,</hi> which brought our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's reputed parents to <hi>Bethlehem:</hi> This is mentioned by ſeveral <hi>Roman</hi> hiſtorians, as <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0251102100:242"/>
Suetonius,</hi> and <hi>Dion. That a great light or a new ſtar appeared in the eaſt, which directed the wiſe men to our Saviour:</hi> This is recorded by <hi>Chalcidius. That</hi> Herod, <hi>the King of</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine, <hi>ſo often mentioned in the</hi> Roman <hi>hiſtory, made a great ſlaughter of innocent children,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo jealous of his ſucceſſor, that he put to death his own ſons on that account: This cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of him is given by ſeveral hiſtorians, and this cruel fact mentioned by <hi>Macrobius,</hi> a heathen Author, who tells it as a known thing, without any mark of doubt upon it. <hi>That our Saviour had been in</hi> Egypt: This <hi>Celſus,</hi> though he raiſes a monſtrous ſtory upon it, is ſo far from denying, that he tells us our Saviour learned the arts of magic in that country. <hi>That</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>was Governor of</hi> Judaea, <hi>that our Saviour was brought in judgment before him, and by him condemned and crucified:</hi> This is recorded by <hi>Tacitus. That many miraculous cures and works out of the ordinary courſe of nature were wrought by him:</hi> This is confeſſed by <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry,</hi> and <hi>Hierocles,</hi> all of them not only <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> but profeſſed enemies and perſecutors of Chriſtianity. <hi>That our Saviour foretold ſeveral things, which came to paſs according to his predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:</hi> This was atteſted by <hi>Phlegon</hi> in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, as we are aſſured by the learned <hi>Origen</hi> againſt <hi>Celſus. That at the time when our Saviour died, there was a miraculous darkneſs and a great earthquake:</hi> This is recorded by the ſame <hi>Phlegon</hi> the <hi>Trallian,</hi> who was likewiſe a <hi>Pagan</hi> and Freeman to <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperor. We may here obſerve, that a native of <hi>Trallium,</hi> which was not ſituate at ſo great a diſtance from <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi>
                     <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0251102100:243"/>
might very probably be informed of ſuch remarkable events as had paſſed among the <hi>Jews</hi> in the age immediately preceding his own times, ſince ſeveral of his countrymen with whom he had converſed, might have received a confuſed report of our Saviour before his crucifixion, and probably lived within the Shake of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and the Shadow of the eclipſe, which are recorded by this Author. <hi>That</hi> Chriſt <hi>was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped as a God among the Chriſtians; that they would rather ſuffer death than blaſpheme him; that they received a ſacrament, and by it entered into a vow of abſtaining from ſin and wickedneſs,</hi> conformable to the advice given by St. <hi>Paul; that they had private aſſemblies of worſhip, and uſed to join together in Hymns</hi>: This is the account which <hi>Pliny</hi> the younger gives of Chriſtianity in his days, about ſeventy years after the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and which agrees in all its circumſtances with the accounts we have in holy writ, of the firſt ſtate of Chriſtianity after the crucifixion of our Bleſſed Saviour. <hi>That St.</hi> Peter, <hi>whoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are many of them recorded in holy writ, did many wonderful works,</hi> is owned by <hi>Julian</hi> the apoſtate, who therefore repreſents him as a great Magician, and one who had in his poſſeſſion a book of magical ſecrets left him by our Saviour. <hi>That the devils or evil ſpirits were ſubject to them,</hi> we may learn from <hi>Porphyry,</hi> who objects to Chriſtianity, that ſince <hi>Jeſus</hi> had begun to be worſhipped, <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> and the reſt of the gods did no more converſe with men. Nay, <hi>Celſus</hi> himſelf affirms the ſame thing in effect, when he ſays, that the power which ſeemed to reſide in Chriſtians, proceeded from the uſe of certain
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0251102100:244"/>
names, and the invocation of certain daemons. <hi>Origen</hi> remarks on this paſſage, that the Author doubtleſs hints at thoſe Chriſtians who put to flight evil ſpirits, and healed thoſe who were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with them; a fact which had been often ſeen, and which he himſelf had ſeen, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares in another part of his diſcourſe againſt <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> But at the ſame time he aſſures us, that this miraculous power was exerted by the uſe of no other name but that of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to which were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſeveral paſſages in his hiſtory, but nothing like any invocation to <hi>Daemons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Celſus</hi> was ſo hard ſet with the report of our Saviour's miracles, and the confident atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations concerning him, that though he often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates he did not believe them to be true, yet knowing he might be ſilenced in ſuch an anſwer, provides himſelf with another retreat, when beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of this; namely, that our Saviour was a magician. Thus he compares the feeding of ſo many thouſands at two different times with a few loaves and fiſhes, to the magical feaſts of thoſe <hi>Egyptian</hi> impoſtors, who would preſent their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators with viſionary entertainments that had in them neither ſubſtance nor reality: which, by the way, is to ſuppoſe, that a hungry and fainting multitude were filled by an apparition, or ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and refreſhed with ſhadows. He knew very well that there were ſo many witneſſes and actors, if I may call them ſuch, in theſe two miracles, that it was impoſſible to refute ſuch multitudes, who had doubtleſs ſufficiently ſpread the fame of them, and was therefore in this place forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to the other ſolution, that it was done by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic. It was not enough to ſay that a miracle
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0251102100:245"/>
which appeared to ſo many thouſand eye-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes was a forgery of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s diſciples, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſing them to be eye-witneſſes, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſhew how they might be deceived.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The unconverted heathens, who were preſſed by the many authorities that confirmed our Saviour's miracles, as well as the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> who had actually ſeen them, were driven to account for them after the ſame manner: For, to work by magic in the heathen way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was in the language of the <hi>Jews</hi> to caſt out devils by <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of the devils. Our Saviour, who knew that unbelievers in all ages would put this perverſe interpretation on his miracles, has branded the malignity of thoſe men, who contrary to the dictates of their own hearts ſtarted ſuch an unreaſonable objection, as a blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not only the guilt, but the puniſhment of ſo black a crime. At the ſame time he condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſhew the vanity and emptineſs of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt his miracles, by repreſenting that they evidently tended to the deſtruction of thoſe powers, to whoſe aſſiſtance the enemies of his doctrine then aſcribed them. An argument, which, if duly weighed, renders the objection ſo very fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous and groundleſs, that we may venture to call it even blaſphemy againſt common ſenſe. Would Magic endeavour to draw off the minds of men from the worſhip which was paid to ſtocks and ſtones, to give them an abhorrence of thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſpirits who rejoiced in the moſt cruel ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in offerings of the greateſt impurity; and in ſhort to call upon mankind to exert their whole ſtrength in the love and adoration of that
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0251102100:246"/>
one Being, from whom they derived their exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and on whom only they were taught to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend every moment for the happineſs and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it? Was it the buſineſs of magic to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manize our natures with compaſſion, forgiveneſs, and all the inſtances of the moſt extenſive cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? Would evil ſpirits contribute to make men ſober, chaſte, and temperate, and in a word to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that reformation, which was wrought in the moral world by thoſe doctrines of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, that received their ſanction from his miracles? Nor is it poſſible to imagine, that evil ſpirits would enter into a combination with our Saviour to cut off all their correſpondence and intercourſe with mankind, and to prevent any for the future from addicting themſelves to thoſe rites and ceremonies, which had done them ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. We ſee the early effect which Chriſtianity had on the minds of men in this particular, by that number of books, which were filled with the ſecrets of magic, and made a ſacrifice to Chriſtianity by the converts mentioned in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles. We have likewiſe an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent inſtance of the inconſiſtency of our Religion with magic, in the hiſtory of the famous <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</hi> This Perſon, who was a kinſman of the Emperor <hi>Trajan,</hi> and likewiſe a man of great learning, notwithſtanding he had embraced Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, could not be brought off from the ſtudies of magic, by the repeated admonitions of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-chriſtians: ſo that at length they expelled him their ſociety, as rather chuſing to loſe the reputation of ſo conſiderable a Proſelyte, than communicate with one who dealt in ſuch dark and infernal practices. Beſides we may obſerve,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0251102100:247"/>
that all the favourers of magic were the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and bitter enemies to the chriſtian religion. Not to mention <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and many others, I ſhall only take notice of thoſe two great perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of chriſtianity, the Emperors <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, both them initiated in the myſteries of divination, and skilled in all the depths of magic. I ſhall only add, that evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits cannot be ſuppoſed to have concurred in the eſtabliſhment of a religion which triumphed over them, drove them out of the places they poſſeſt, and diveſted them of their influence on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: nor would I mention this particular, though it be unanimouſly reported by all the ancient chriſtian Authors; did it not appear from the authorities above-cited, that this was a fact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by heathens themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. We now ſee what a multitude of <hi>Pagan</hi> teſtimonies may be produced for all thoſe remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſages, which might have been expected from them: and indeed of ſeveral, that, I believe, do more than anſwer your expectation, as they were not ſubjects in their own nature ſo expoſed to publick notoriety. It cannot be expected they ſhould mention particulars, which were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted amongſt the Diſciples only, or among ſome few even of the Diſciples themſelves; ſuch as the transfiguration, the agony in the garden, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>Chriſt</hi> after his reſurrection, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the like nature. It was impoſſible for a heathen author to relate theſe things; becauſe if he had believed them, he would no longer have been a heathen, and by that means his teſtimony would not have been thought of ſo much vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. Beſides, his very report of facts ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0251102100:248"/>
to Chriſtianity would have prompted men to ſay that he was probably tainted with their doctrine. We have a parallel caſe in <hi>Hecataeus,</hi> a famous <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſtorian, who had ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in his book conformable to the hiſtory of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> writers, which when quoted by <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> as a confirmation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> hiſtory, when his heathen adverſaries could give no other anſwer to it, they would need ſuppoſe that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cataeus</hi> was a <hi>Jew</hi> in his heart, though they had no other reaſon for it, but becauſe his hiſtory gave greater authority to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> than the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Records.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">I. TO this liſt of heathen writers, who make mention of our Saviour, or touch upon any particulars of his life, I ſhall add thoſe Authors who were at firſt heathens, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards concerted to Chriſtianity; upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as I ſhall here ſhew, their teſtimonies are to be looked upon as the more authentick. And in this liſt of evidences, I ſhall confine my ſelf to ſuch learned <hi>Pagans</hi> as came over to Chriſtianity in the three firſt centuries, becauſe thoſe were the times in which men had the beſt means of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming themſelves of the truth of our Saviour's hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and becauſe among the great number of Philoſophers who came in afterwards, under the reigns of chriſtian Emperors, there might be ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral who did it partly out of worldly motives.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Let us now ſuppoſe, that a learned heathen writer who lived within 60 years of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's crucifixion, after having ſhewn that falſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were generally wrought in obſcurity, and before few or no witneſſes, ſpeaking of thoſe which were wrought by our Saviour, has the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paſſage.
<q rend="margQuotes">But his works were always ſeen, becauſe they were true, they were ſeen by thoſe who were healed, and by thoſe who were raiſed from the dead. Nay theſe perſons who were thus healed, and raiſed, were ſeen not only at the time of their being healed, and raiſed, but long afterwards. Nay they were ſeen not only all the while our Saviour was upon earth, but ſurvived after his departure out of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0251102100:250"/>
this world, nay ſome of them were living in our days.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. I dare ſay you would look upon this as a glorious atteſtation for the cauſe of Chriſtianity, had it come from the hand of a famous <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Philoſopher. Theſe forementioned words however are actually the words of one who lived about ſixty Years after our Saviour's crucifixion, and was a famous Philoſopher in <hi>Athens:</hi> but it will be ſaid, he was a convert to Chriſtianity. Now conſider this matter impartially, and ſee if his teſtimony is not much more valid for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Had he continued a <hi>Pagan</hi> Philoſopher, would not the world have ſaid that he was not ſincere in what he writ, or did not believe it; for, if ſo, would not they have told us he would have embraced Chriſtianity? This was indeed the caſe of this excellent man: he had ſo thoroughly examined the truth of our Saviour's hiſtory, and the excellency of that religion which he taught, and was ſo entirely convinced of both, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Proſelyte and died a Martyr.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> was an <hi>Athenian</hi> Philoſopher, at the ſame time, famed for his learning and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but converted to Chriſtianity. As it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be queſtioned that he peruſed and approved the apology of <hi>Quadratus,</hi> in which is the paſſage juſt now cited, he joined with him in an apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of his own, to the ſame Emperor, on the ſame ſubject. This apology, tho' now loſt, was extant in the time of <hi>Ado Viennenſis, A. D.</hi> 870, and highly eſteemed by the moſt learned <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as that Author witneſſes. It muſt have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained great arguments for the truth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's hiſtory, becauſe in it he aſſerted the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0251102100:251"/>
of our Saviour, which could not but engage him in the proof of his miracles.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. I do allow that, generally ſpeaking, a man is not ſo acceptable and unqueſtioned an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in facts, which make for the advancement of his own party. But we muſt conſider that, in the caſe before us, the perſons to whom we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, were of an oppoſite party, till they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of the truth of thoſe very facts, which they report. They bear evidence to a hiſtory in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Chriſtianity, the truth of which hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was their motive to embrace Chriſtianity. They atteſt facts which they had heard while they were yet heathens, and had they not found rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe them, they would ſtill have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued heathens, and have made no mention of them in their writings.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. When a man is born under chriſtian Parents, and trained up in the profeſſion of that religion from a child, he generally guides himſelf by the rules of <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> in believing what is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Evangeliſts; but the learned <hi>Pagans</hi> of antiquity, before they became Chriſtians, were only guided by the common rules of <hi>Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Faith:</hi> That is, they examined the nature of the evidence which was to be met with in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fame, tradition, and the writings of thoſe perſons who related them, together with the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, concurrence, veracity, and private characters of thoſe perſons; and being convinced upon all accounts that they had the ſame reaſon to believe the hiſtory of our Saviour, as that of any other perſon to which they themſelves were not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eye-witneſſes, they were bound by all the rules of hiſtorical faith, and of right reaſon, to give
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0251102100:252"/>
credit to this hiſtory. This they did accordingly, and in conſequence of it publiſhed the ſame truths themſelves, ſuffered many afflictions, and very often death it ſelf, in the aſſertion of them. When I ſay, that an hiſtorical belief of the acts of our Saviour induced theſe learned <hi>Pagans</hi> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his doctrine, I do not deny that there were many other motives, which conduced to it, as the excellency of his precepts, the fulfilling of prophecies, the miracles of his Diſciples, the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproachable lives and magnanimous ſufferings of their followers, with other conſiderations of the ſame nature: but whatever other collateral arguments wrought more or leſs with Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of that age, it is certain that a belief in the hiſtory of our Saviour was one motive with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry new convert, and that upon which all others turned, as being the very baſis and foundation of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. To this I muſt further add, that as we have already ſeen many particular facts which are recorded in holy writ, atteſted by particular <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> Authors: the teſtimony of thoſe I am now going to produce, extends to the whole hiſtory of our Saviour, and to that continued ſeries of actions, which are related of him and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the books of the <hi>New-Teſtament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. This evidently appears from their quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations out of the Evangeliſts, for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any doctrine or account of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Nay a learned man of our nation, who examined the writings of the moſt ancient Fathers in another view, refers to ſeveral paſſages in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Tertullian, Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> by which he plainly ſhows that
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0251102100:253"/>
each of theſe early writers aſcribe to the four E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts by name their reſpective hiſtories; ſo that there is not the leaſt room for doubting of their belief in the hiſtory of our Saviour, as recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Goſpels. I ſhall add, that three of the five Fathers here mentioned, and probably four, were <hi>Pagans</hi> converted to Chriſtianity, as they were all of them very inquiſitive and deep in the knowledge of heathen learning and philoſophy.</p>

                  <p n="1">I. IT happened very providentially to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Chriſtian religion, that it did not take its riſe in the dark illiterate ages of the world, but at a time when arts and ſciences were at their height, and when there were men who made it the buſineſs of their lives to ſearch after truth, and ſift the ſeveral opinions of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0251102100:254"/>
and wiſe men, concerning the duty, the end, and chief happineſs of reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Several of theſe therefore, when they had informed themſelves of our Saviour's hiſtory, and examined with unprejudiced minds the doctrines and manners of his diſciples and followers, were ſo ſtruck and convinced, that they profeſſed themſelves of that ſect; notwithſtanding, by this profeſſion in that juncture of time, they bid fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to all the pleaſures of this life, renounced all the views of ambition, engaged in an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted courſe of ſeverities, and expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to publick hatred and contempt, to ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of all kinds, and to death itſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Of this ſort we may reckon thoſe three early converts to Chriſtianity, who each of them was a member of a Senate famous for its wiſdom and learning. <hi>Joſeph</hi> the <hi>Arimathean</hi> was of the <hi>Jewiſh Sanhedrim, Dionyſius</hi> of the <hi>Athenian A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reopagus,</hi> and <hi>Flavius Clemens</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; nay at the time of his death Conſul of <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe three were ſo throughly ſatisfied of the truth of the Chriſtian religion, that the firſt of them, according to all the reports of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, died a martyr for it; as did the ſecond, unleſs we disbelieve <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> his fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen and contemporary; and the third, as we are informed both by <hi>Roman</hi> and Chriſtian Authors.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Among thoſe innumerable multitudes, who in moſt of the known nations of the world came over to Chriſtianity at its firſt appearance, we may be ſure there were great numbers of wiſe and learned men, beſide thoſe whoſe names are in the Chriſtian records, who without doubt
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0251102100:255"/>
took care to examine the truth of our Saviour's hiſtory, before they would leave the religion of their country and of their forefathers, for the ſake of one that would not only cut them off from the allurements of this world, but ſubject them to every thing terrible or diſagreeable in it. <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells the <hi>Roman</hi> Governors, that their corporations, councils, armies, tribes, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the palace, ſenate, and courts of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were filled with Chriſtians; as <hi>Arnobius</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, that men of the fineſt parts and learning, Orators, Grammarians, Rhetoricians, Lawyers, Phyſicians, Philoſophers, deſpiſing the ſentiments they had been once fond of, took up their reſt in the Chriſtian religion.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Who can imagine that men of this chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter did not thoroughly inform themſelves of the hiſtory of that perſon, whoſe doctrines they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced? for however conſonant to reaſon his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts appeared, how good ſoever were the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which they produced in the world, nothing could have tempted men to acknowledge him as their God and Saviour, but their being firmly perſuaded of the miracles he wrought, and the many atteſtations of his divine miſſion, which were to be met with in the hiſtory of his life. This was the ground-work of the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and, if this failed, the whole ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture ſunk with it. This point therefore, of the truth of our Saviour's hiſtory, as recorded by the Evangeliſts, is every where taken for granted in the writings of thoſe, who from <hi>Pagan</hi> Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers became Chriſtian Authors, and who, by reaſon of their converſion, are to be looked upon as of the ſtrongeſt collateral teſtimony for the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0251102100:256"/>
truth of what is delivered concerning our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Beſides innumerable Authors that are loſt, we have the undoubted names, works, or frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſeveral <hi>Pagan</hi> Philoſophers, which ſhew them to have been as learned as any unconverted heathen Authors of the age in which the lived. If we look into the greateſt nurſeries of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe ages of the world, we find in <hi>Athens, Dionyſius, Quadratus, Ariſtides, Athenagoras</hi>; and in <hi>Alexandria, Dionyſius, Clemens, Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Arnobius,</hi> and <hi>Anatolius,</hi> to whom we may add <hi>Origen</hi>; for though his father was a Chriſtian martyr, he became, without all controverſy, the moſt learned and able Philoſopher of his age, by his education at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in that famous ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of arts and ſciences.</p>

                  <p n="1">I. IT now therefore only remains to conſider, whether theſe learned men had means and opportunities of informing themſelves of the truth of our Saviour's hiſtory; for unleſs this point can be made out, their teſtimonies will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear invalid, and their enquiries ineffectual.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. As to this point, we muſt conſider, that many thouſands had ſeen the tranſactions of our Saviour in <hi>Judaea,</hi> and that many hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands had received an account of them from the mouths of thoſe who were actually eye-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. I ſhall only mention among theſe eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes the twelve Apoſtles, to whom we muſt
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0251102100:258"/>
add St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had a particular call to this high office, though many other diſciples and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Chriſt</hi> had alſo their ſhare in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing this wonderful hiſtory. We learn from the ancient records of Chriſtianity, that many of the Apoſtles and Diſciples made it the expreſs buſineſs of their lives, travelled into the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt parts of the world, and in all places gathered multitudes about them, to acquaint them with the hiſtory and doctrines of their crucified Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. And indeed, were all Chriſtian records of theſe proceedings entirely loſt, as many have been, the effect plainly evinces the truth of them; for how elſe during the Apoſtles lives could Chriſtianity have ſpread itſelf with ſuch an ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing progreſs through the ſeveral nations of the <hi>Roman</hi> empire? how could it fly like lightning, and carry conviction with it, from one end of the earth to the other?</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Heathens therefore of every age, ſex, and quality, born in the moſt different climates, and bred up under the moſt different inſtitutions, when they ſaw men of plain ſenſe, without the help of learning, armed with patience and courage, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of wealth, pomp, or power, expreſſing in their lives thoſe excellent doctrines of Morality, which they taught as delivered to them from our Saviour, averring that they had ſeen his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles during his life, and converſed with him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death; when, I ſay, they ſaw no ſuſpicion of falſhood, treachery, or worldly intereſt, in their behaviour and converſation, and that they ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the moſt ignominious and cruel deaths, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than retract their teſtimony, or even be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in matters which they were to publiſh by their
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0251102100:259"/>
Saviour's eſpecial command, there was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt of the veracity of thoſe facts which they related, or of the Divine Miſſion in which they were employed.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. But even theſe motives to Faith in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour would not have been ſufficient to have brought about in ſo few years ſuch an incredible number of converſions, had not the Apoſtles been able to exhibit ſtill greater proofs of the truths which they taught. A few perſons of an odious and deſpiſed country could not have filled the world with Believers, had they not ſhown undoubted credentials from the Divine perſon who ſent them on ſuch a meſſage. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are aſſured, that they were inveſted with the power of working miracles, which was the moſt ſhort and the moſt convincing argument that could be produced, and the only one that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to the reaſon of all mankind, to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of the wiſe and ignorant, and could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come every cavil and every prejudice. Who would not believe that our Saviour healed the ſick, and raiſed the dead, when it was publiſhed by thoſe who themſelves often did the ſame mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, in their preſence, and in his name! Could any reaſonable perſon imagine, that God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would arm men with ſuch powers to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize a lye, and eſtabliſh a religion in the world which was diſpleaſing to him, or that evil ſpirits would lend them ſuch an effectual aſſiſtance to beat down vice and idolatry?</p>
                  <p n="5">V. When the Apoſtles had formed many aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies in ſeveral parts of the <hi>Pagan</hi> world, who gave credit to the glad tidings of the Goſpel, that, upon their departure, the memory of what they
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0251102100:260"/>
had related might not periſh, they appointed out of theſe new converts, men of the beſt ſenſe, and of the moſt unblemiſhed lives, to preſide over theſe ſeveral Aſſemblies, and to inculcate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing what they had heard from the mouths of theſe eye-witneſſes.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Upon the death of any of thoſe ſubſtitutes to the Apoſtles and Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his place was filled up with ſome other perſon of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence for his piety and learning, and generally a member of the ſame Church, who after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe was followed by another in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by which means the ſucceſſion was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an uninterrupted line. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> informs us, that every church preſerved a catalogue of its Biſhops in the order that they ſucceeded one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and (for an example) produces a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of thoſe who governed the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in that character, which contains eight or nine perſons, though but at a very ſmall remove from the times of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the liſts of Biſhops, which are come down to us in other churches, are generally filled with greater numbers than one would expect. But the ſucceſſion was quick in the three firſt centuries, becauſe the Biſhop very often ended in the Martyr: for when a perſecution aroſe in any place, the firſt fury of it fell upon this Order of holy men, who abundantly teſtified by their Deaths and Sufferings that they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take theſe offices out of any temporal views, that they were ſincere and ſatisfied in the belief of what they taught, and that they firmly adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to what they had received from the Apoſtles, as laying down their lives in the ſame hope, and upon the ſame principles. None can be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0251102100:261"/>
ſo utterly regardleſs of their own happineſs as to expire in torment, and hazard their Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to ſupport any fables and inventions of their own, or any forgeries of their predeceſſors who had preſided in the ſame church, and which might have been eaſily detected by the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that particular church, as well as by the concurring teſtimony of others. To this purpoſe, I think it is very remarkable, that there was not a ſingle Martyr among thoſe many Hereticks, who diſagreed with the Apoſtolical church, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſeveral wild and abſurd notions into the doctrines of Chriſtianity. They durſt not ſtake their preſent and future happineſs on their own chimerical imaginations, and did not only ſhun perſecution, but affirmed that it was unneceſſary for their followers to bear their religion through ſuch fiery tryals.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. We may fairly reckon, that this firſt age of Apoſtles and Diſciples, with that ſecond gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of many who were their immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, extended itſelf to the middle of the ſecond Century, and that ſeveral of the third generation from theſe laſt mentioned, which was but the fifth from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> continued to the end of the third Century. Did we know the ages and numbers of the members in every particular church, which was planted by the Apoſtles, I doubt not but in moſt of them there might be found five perſons who in a continued ſeries would reach through theſe three centuries of years, that is till the 265th from the death of our Saviour.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Among the accounts of thoſe very few out of innumerable multitudes, who had embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Chriſtianity, I ſhall ſingle out four perſons, eminent for their lives, their writings, and their
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0251102100:262"/>
ſufferings, that were ſucceſſively contemporaries, and bring us down as far as to the year of our Lord 254. St. <hi>John,</hi> who was the beloved Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple, and converſed the moſt intimately with our Saviour, lived till <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 100. <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp,</hi> who was the Diſciple of St. <hi>John,</hi> and had converſed with others of the Apoſtles and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our Lord, lived till <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 167, though his life was ſhortened by martyrdom. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who was the Diſciple of <hi>Polycarp,</hi> and had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with many of the immediate Diſciples of the Apoſtles, lived, at the loweſt computation of his age, till the year 202, when he was likewiſe cut off by martyrdom; in which year the great <hi>Origen</hi> was appointed Regent of the Catechetick ſchool in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and as he was the miracle of that age, for induſtry, learning and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, he was looked upon as the champion of Chriſtianity, till the year 254, when, if he did not ſuffer martyrdom, as ſome think he did, he was certainly actuated by the ſpirit of it, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the whole courſe of his life and writings; nay, he had often been put to the torture, and had undergone tryals worſe than death. As he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with the moſt eminent Chriſtians of his time in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the Eaſt, brought over multitudes both from hereſy and heatheniſm, and left behind him ſeveral Diſciples of great fame and learning, there is no queſtion but there were conſiderable numbers of thoſe who knew him, and had been his hearers, ſcholars, or proſelytes, that lived till the end of the third century, and to the reign of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. It is evident to thoſe, who read the lives and writings of <hi>Polycarp, Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> that theſe three Fathers believed the accounts

which are given of our Saviour in the four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, and had undoubted arguments that not only St. <hi>John,</hi> but many others of our Saviour's diſciples, publiſhed the ſame accounts of him. To which we muſt ſubjoin this further remark, that what was believed by theſe Fathers on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, was likewiſe the belief of the main body of Chriſtians in thoſe ſucceſſive ages when they flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed; ſince <hi>Polycarp</hi> cannot but be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if we conſider the reſpect that was paid him, as the repreſentative of the Eaſtern Churches in this particular, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> of the Weſtern upon the ſame account, and <hi>Origen</hi> of thoſe eſtabliſhed in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">X. To theſe I might add <hi>Paul</hi> the famous her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, who retired from the <hi>Decian</hi> perſecution five or ſix years before <hi>Origen</hi>'s death, and lived till the year 343. I have only diſcovered one of thoſe channels by which the hiſtory of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our might be conveyed pure and unadulterated, through thoſe ſeveral ages that produced thoſe <hi>Pagan</hi> Philoſophers, whoſe teſtimonies I make uſe of for the truth of our Saviour's hiſtory. Some or other of theſe Philoſophers came into the Chriſtian faith during its infancy, in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral periods of theſe three firſt centuries, when they had ſuch means of informing themſelves in all the particulars of our Saviour's hiſtory. I muſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther add, that though I have here only choſen this ſingle link of martyrs, I might find out others among thoſe names which are ſtill extant, that delivered down this account of our Saviour in a ſucceſſive tradition, till the whole <hi>Roman</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire became Chriſtian; as there is no queſtion but numberleſs ſeries of witneſſes might follow
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0251102100:264"/>
one another in the ſame order, and in as ſhort a chain, and that perhaps in every ſingle Church, had the names and ages of the moſt eminent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians have been tranſmitted to us with the like certainty.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. But to give this conſideration more force, we muſt take notice, that the tradition of the firſt ages of Chriſtianity had ſeveral circumſtances peculiar to it, which made it more authentick than any other tradition in any other age of the world. The Chriſtians, who carried their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion through ſo many general and particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, were inceſſantly comforting and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting one another, with the example and hiſtory of our Saviour and his Apoſtles. It was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject not only of their ſolemn aſſemblies, but of their private viſits and converſations. <hi>Our virgins,</hi> ſays <hi>Tatian,</hi> who lived in the ſecond century, <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe over their diſtaffs on divine ſubjects.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when religion was woven into the civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and flouriſhed under the protection of the Emperors, men's thoughts and diſcourſes were, as they are now, full of ſecular affairs; but in the three firſt centuries of Chriſtianity, men, who embraced this religion, had given up all their intereſts in this world, and lived in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual preparation for the next, as not knowing how ſoon they might be called to it: ſo that they had little elſe to talk of but the life and doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of that divine perſon, which was their hope, their encouragement, and their glory. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore imagine, that there was a ſingle perſon arrived at any degree of age or conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who had not heard and repeated above a thouſand times in his life, all the particulars of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0251102100:265"/>
our Saviour's birth, life, death, reſurrection, and aſcenſion.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. Eſpecially if we conſider, that they could not then be received as Chriſtians, till they had undergone ſeveral examinations. Perſons of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per years, who flocked daily into the Church during the three firſt centuries, were obliged to paſs through many repeated inſtructions, and give a ſtrict account of their proficiency, before they were admitted to Baptiſm. And as for thoſe who were born of Chriſtian parents, and had been baptiſed in their infancy, they were with the like care prepared and diſciplined for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they could not arrive at, till they were found upon examination to have made a ſufficient progreſs in the knowledge of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. We muſt further obſerve, that there was not only in thoſe times this religious converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among private Chriſtians, but a conſtant cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence between the Churches that were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by the Apoſtles or their ſucceſſors, in the ſeveral parts of the world. If any new doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine was ſtarted, or any fact reported of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, a ſtrict enquiry was made among the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, eſpecially thoſe planted by the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whether they had received any ſuch doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine or account of our Saviour, from the mouths of the Apoſtles, or the tradition of thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who had preceded the preſent members of the Churches which were thus conſulted. By this means, when any novelty was publiſhed, it was immediately detected and cenſured.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. St. <hi>John,</hi> who lived ſo many years after our Saviour, was appealed to in theſe emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

as the living Oracle of the Church; and as his oral teſtimony laſted the firſt century, many have obſerved that, by a particular providence of God, ſeveral of our Saviour's Diſciples, and of the early converts of his religion, lived to a very great age, that they might perſonally convey the truth of the Goſpel to thoſe times, which were very remote from the firſt publication of it.

                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">I. THUS far we ſee how the learned <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> might apprize themſelves from oral information of the particulars of our Saviour's hiſtory. They could hear, in every Church planted in every diſtant part of the earth, the account which was there received and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among them, of the hiſtory of our Saviour. They could learn the names and characters of thoſe firſt miſſionaries that brought to them theſe
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0251102100:268"/>
accounts, and the miracles by which God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty atteſted their reports. But the Apoſtles and Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to preſerve the hiſtory of his life, and to ſecure their accounts of him from error and oblivion, did not only ſet aſide certain perſons for that purpoſe, as has been already ſhewn, but appropriated certain days to the commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe facts which they had related con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him. The firſt day of the week was in all its returns a perpetual memorial of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as the devotional exerciſes adapted to <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> and <hi>Saturday,</hi> were to denote to all ages that he was crucified on the one of thoſe days, and that he reſted in the grave on the other. You may apply the ſame remark to ſeveral of the annual feſtivals inſtituted by the Apoſtles themſelves, or at furtheſt by their immediate Succeſſors, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the moſt important particulars in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's hiſtory; to which we muſt add the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inſtituted by our Lord himſelf, and many of thoſe rites and ceremonies which obtained in the moſt early times of the Church. Theſe are to be regarded as ſtanding marks of ſuch facts as were delivered by thoſe, who were eye-witneſſes to them, and which were contrived with great wiſdom to laſt till time ſhould be no more. Theſe, without any other means, might have, in ſome meaſure, conveyed to poſterity, the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſeveral tranſactions in the hiſtory of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as they were related by his Diſciples. At leaſt, the reaſon of theſe inſtitutions, though they might be forgotten, and obſcured by a long courſe of years, could not but be very well known by thoſe who lived in the three firſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, and a means of informing the inquiſitive
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0251102100:269"/>
                     <hi>Pagans</hi> in the truth of our Saviour's hiſtory, that being the view in which I am to conſider them.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. But leaſt ſuch a tradition, though guarded by ſo many expedients, ſhould wear out by the length of time, the four Evangeliſts within about fifty, or, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> affirms, thirty years, after our Saviour's death, while the memory of his actions was freſh among them, conſigned to writing that hiſtory, which for ſome years had been publiſhed only by the mouth of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Diſciples. The further conſideration of theſe holy penmen will fall under another part of this diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. It will be ſufficient to obſerve here, that in the age which ſucceeded the Apoſtles, many of their immediate Diſciples ſent or carrried in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the books of the four Evangeliſts, which had been written by Apoſtles, or at leaſt approved by them, to moſt of the Churches which they had planted in the different parts of the world. This was done with ſo much diligence, that when <hi>Pantaenus,</hi> a man of great learning and piety, had travelled into <hi>India</hi> for the propagation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, about the year of our Lord 200, he found among that remote people the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> which upon his return from that country he brought with him to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> This Goſpel is generally ſuppoſed to have been left in thoſe parts by St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of the <hi>Indies,</hi> who probably carried it with him before the writings of the three other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts were publiſh'd.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. That the hiſtory of our Saviour, as recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Evangeliſts, was the ſame with that which had been before delivered by the Apoſtles
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0251102100:270"/>
and Diſciples, will further appear in the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this diſcourſe, and may be gathered from the following conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Had theſe writings differed from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the firſt planters of Chriſtianity, either in hiſtory or doctrine, there is no queſtion but they would have been rejected by thoſe Churches which they had already formed. But ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent and uniform was the relation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that theſe hiſtories appeared to be nothing elſe but their tradition and oral atteſtations made fixt and permanent. Thus was the fame of our Saviour, which in ſo few years had gone through the whole earth, confirmed and perpetuated by ſuch records, as would preſerve the traditionary account of him to after-ages; and rectifie it, if at at any time, by paſſing through ſeveral genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it might drop any part that was material, or contract any thing that was falſe or fictitious.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Accordingly we find the ſame <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who was born of a Virgin, who had wrought many miracles in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> who was crucified, roſe again, and aſcended into Heaven; I ſay, the ſame <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had been preached, and was worſhipped, in <hi>Germany, France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> in <hi>Parthia, Media, Meſopotamia, Armenia, Phrygia, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Pamphylia,</hi> in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Egypt, Afric,</hi> and beyond <hi>Cyrene, India</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> and, in ſhort, in all the iſlands and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces that are viſited by the riſing or ſetting ſun. The ſame account of our Saviour's life and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was delivered by thouſands of Preachers, and believed in thouſands of places, who all, as faſt as it could be conveyed to them, received the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0251102100:271"/>
ſame account in writing from the four Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to this purpoſe very aptly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, that thoſe barbarous nations, who in his time were not poſſeſt of the written goſpels, and had only learned the hiſtory of our Saviour from thoſe who had converted them to Chriſtianity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpels were written, had among them the ſame accounts of our Saviour, which are to be met with in the four Evangeliſts. An uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible proof of the harmony and concurrence between the holy ſcripture and the tradition of the Churches in thoſe early times of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Thus we ſee what opportunities the learned and inquiſitive heathens had of informing themſelves of the truth of our Saviour's hiſtory, during the three firſt Centuries, eſpecially as they lay nearer one than another to the fountain-head: beſide which, there were many uncontroverted traditions, records of Chriſtianity, and particular hiſtories, that then threw light into theſe matters, but are now entirely loſt, by which, at that time, any appearance of contradiction, or ſeeming dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, in the hiſtory of the Evangeliſts, were fully cleared up and explained: though we meet with fewer appearances of this nature in the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Saviour, as related by the four Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, than in the accounts of any other perſon, publiſhed by ſuch a number of different hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who lived at ſo great a diſtance from the preſent age.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. Among thoſe records which are loſt, and were of great uſe to the primitive Chriſtians, is the letter to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> which I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0251102100:272"/>
that of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> which I ſhall take notice of hereafter; the writings of <hi>Hegeſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> who had drawn down the hiſtory of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity to his own time, which was not beyond the middle of the ſecond Century; the genuine <hi>Sibyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> oracles, which in the firſt ages of the Church were eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the ſpurious; the records preſerved in particular Churches, with many other of the ſame nature.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">I. THERE were other means, which I find had a great influence on the learned of the three firſt Centuries, to create and confirm in them the belief of our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's hiſtory, which ought not to be paſſed over in ſilence. The firſt was, the opportunity they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0251102100:273"/>
of examining thoſe miracles, which were on ſeveral occaſions performed by Chriſtians, and appeared in the Church, more or leſs, during theſe firſt ages of Chriſtianity. Theſe had great weight with the men I am now ſpeaking of, who, from learned <hi>Pagans,</hi> became fathers of the Church; for they frequently boaſt of them in their writings, as atteſtations given by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the truth of their religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. At the ſame time, that theſe learned men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how diſigenuous, baſe and wicked it would be, how much beneath the dignity of Philoſophy, and contrary to the precepts of Chriſtianity, to utter falſhoods or forgeries in the ſupport of a cauſe, though never ſo juſt in it ſelf, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently aſſert this miraculous power, which then ſubſiſted in the Church, nay, tell us that they themſelves had been eye-witneſſes of it at ſeveral times, and in ſeveral inſtances; nay, appeal to the heathens themſelves for the truth of ſeveral facts they relate, nay challenge them to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at their aſſemblies, and ſatisfy themſelves, if they doubt of it; nay we find that <hi>Pagan</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have in ſome inſtances confeſſed this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous power.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The letter of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> whoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was preſerved by a refreſhing ſhower, at the ſame time that his enemies were diſcomfited by a ſtorm of lightning, and which the heathen hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans themſelves allow to have been ſupernatural and the effect of magic: I ſay, this letter, which aſcribed this unexpected aſſiſtance to the prayers of the Chriſtians, who then ſerved in the army, would have been thought an unqueſtionable teſtimony of the miraculous power I am ſpeaking of,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0251102100:274"/>
had it been ſtill preſerved. It is ſufficient for me in this Place to take notice, that this was one of thoſe miracles which had its influence on the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Converts, becauſe it is related by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and the very letter appealed to. When theſe learned men ſaw ſickneſs and frenzy cured, the dead raiſed, the oracles put to ſilence, the <hi>Daemons</hi> and evil ſpirits forced to confeſs themſelves no Gods, by perſons who only made uſe of prayer and adjurations in the name of their crucified Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; how could they doubt of their Saviour's power on the like occaſions, as repreſented to them by the traditions of the Church, and the writings of the Evangeliſts?</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Under this head, I cannot omit that which appears to me a ſtanding miracle in the three firſt Centuries, I mean that amazing and ſupernatural courage or patience, which was ſhewn by innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable multitudes of Martyrs, in thoſe ſlow and painful torments that were inflicted on them. I cannot conceive a man placed in the burning iron chair at <hi>Lyons,</hi> amid the inſults and mockeries of a crouded Amphitheatre, and ſtill keeping his ſeat; or ſtretched upon a grate of iron, over coals of fire, and breathing out his ſoul among the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſufferings of ſuch a tedious execution, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than renounce his religion, or blaſpheme his Saviour. Such tryals ſeem to me above the ſtrength of human nature, and able to over-bear duty, reaſon, faith, conviction, nay, and the moſt abſolute certainty of a future ſtate. Humanity, unaſſiſted in an extraordinary manner, muſt have ſhaken off the preſent preſſure, and have deliver'd it ſelf out of ſuch a dreadful diſtreſs, by any means that could have been ſuggeſted to it. We can
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0251102100:275"/>
eaſily imagine, that many perſons, in ſo good a cauſe, might have laid down their lives at the gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, the ſtake, or the block: but to expire leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among the moſt exquiſite tortures, when they might come out of them, even by a mental reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or an hypocriſy which was not without a poſſibility of being followed by repentance and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, has ſomething in it, ſo far beyond the force and natural ſtrength of mortals, that one cannot but think there was ſome miraculous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſupport the ſufferer.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. We find the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> in that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable letter which gives an account of the death of <hi>Polycarp</hi> their beloved Biſhop, mentioning the cruel torments of other early Martyrs for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, are of opinion, that our Saviour ſtood by them in a viſion, and perſonally converſed with them, to give them ſtrength and comfort during the bitterneſs of their long-continued agonies; and we have the ſtory of a young man, who, having ſuffered many tortures, eſcaped with life, and told his fellow-chriſtians, that the pain of them had been rendered tolerable, by the preſence of an Angel who ſtood by him, and wiped off the tears and ſweat, which ran down his face whilſt he lay under his ſufferings. We are aſſured at leaſt that the firſt Martyr for Chriſtianity was encouraged in his laſt moments, by a viſion of that divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for whom he ſuffered, and into whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence he was then haſtening.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Let any man calmly lay his hand upon his heart, and after reading theſe terrible conflicts in which the ancient Martyrs and Confeſſors were engaged, when they paſſed through ſuch new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and varieties of pain, as tired their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors;
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0251102100:276"/>
and ask himſelf, however zealous and ſincere he is in his religion, whether under ſuch acute and lingring tortures he could ſtill have held faſt his integrity, and have profeſſed his faith to the laſt, without a ſupernatural aſſiſtance of ſome kind or other. For my part, when I conſider that it was not an unaccountable obſtinacy in a ſingle man, or in any particular ſett of men, in ſome extraordinary juncture; but that there were multitudes of each ſex, of every age, of different countries and conditions, who for near 300 years together made this glorious confeſſion of their faith, in the midſt of tortures, and in the hour of death: I muſt conclude, that they were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of another make than men are at preſent, or that they had ſuch miraculous ſupports as were peculiar to thoſe times of Chriſtianity, when without them perhaps the very name of it might have been extinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. It is certain, that the deaths and ſufferings of the primitive Chriſtians had a great ſhare in the converſion of thoſe learned <hi>Pagans,</hi> who lived in the ages of Perſecution, which with ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals and abatements laſted near 300 years after our Saviour. <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Tertullian, Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Arnobius,</hi> and others, tell us, that this firſt of all alarmed their curioſity, rouſed their attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and made them ſeriouſly inquiſitive into the nature of that religion, which could endue the mind with ſo much ſtrength, and overcome the fear of death, nay raiſe an earneſt deſire of it, though it appeared in all its terrors. This they found had not been effected by all the doctrines of thoſe Philoſophers, whom they had thoroughly ſtudied, and who had been labouring at this great
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0251102100:277"/>
point. The ſight of theſe dying and tormented Martyrs engaged them to ſearch into the hiſtory and doctrines of him for whom they ſuffered. The more they ſearched, the more they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced; till their conviction grew ſo ſtrong, that they themſelves embraced the ſame truths, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actually laid down their lives, or were always in a readineſs to do it, rather than depart from them.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">I. THE ſecond of thoſe extraordinary means, of great uſe to the learned and inquiſitive <hi>Pagans</hi> of the three firſt Centuries, for evincing the truth of the hiſtory of our Saviour, was the completion of ſuch prophecies as are
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0251102100:278"/>
recorded of him in the Evangeliſts. They could not indeed form any arguments from what he foretold, and was fulfilled during his life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both the prophecy and the completion were over before they were publiſhed by the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts; though, as <hi>Origen</hi> obſerves, what end could there be in forging ſome of theſe predictions, as that of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s denying his maſter, and all his Diſciples forſaking him in the greateſt extremity, which reflects ſo much ſhame on the great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and on all his companions? Nothing but a ſtrict adherence to truth, and to matters of fact, could have prompted the Evangeliſts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a circumſtance ſo diſadvantageous to their own reputation; as that Father has well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. But to purſue his reflections on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. There are predictions of our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by the Evangeliſts, which were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted till after their deaths, and had no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of being ſo, when they were pronounced by our bleſſed Saviour. Such was that wonderful notice he gave them, that they ſhould be brought before Governours and Kings for his ſake, for a teſtimony againſt them and the <hi>Gentiles, Mat.</hi> 10.28. with the other like prophecies, by which he foretold that his Diſciples were to be perſecuted. Is there any other doctrine in the world, ſays this Father, whoſe followers are puniſhed? Can the enemies of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſay, that he knew his opinions were falſe and impious, and that therefore he might well conjecture and foretell what would be the treatment of thoſe perſons who ſhould embrace them? Suppoſing his doctrines were really ſuch, why ſhould this be the conſequence? what likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0251102100:279"/>
that men ſhould be brought before Kings and Governours for opinions and tenets of any kind, when this never happened even to the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who abſolutely denied a Providence; nor to the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> themſelves, who laughed at the prayers and ſacrifices which were made to the Divinity? Are there any but the Chriſtians who, according to this prediction of our Saviour, being brought before Kings and Governours for his ſake, are preſſed to their lateſt gaſp of breath, by their reſpective judges, to renounce Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to procure their liberty and reſt, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the ſame ſacrifices, and taking the ſame oaths that others did?</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Conſider the time when our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced thoſe words, Matt. 10.32. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſs me before men, him will I confeſs alſo before my Father which is in heaven: but whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall deny me before men, him will I alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny before my Father which is in heaven.</hi> Had you heard him ſpeak after this manner, when as yet his Diſciples were under no ſuch tryals, you would certainly have ſaid within your ſelf, If theſe ſpeeches of <hi>Jeſus</hi> are true, and if, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his prediction, Governours and Kings under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to ruin and deſtroy thoſe who ſhall profeſs themſelves his Diſciples, we will believe (not only that he is a Prophet) but that he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived power from God ſufficient to preſerve and propagate his religion; and that he would never talk in ſuch a peremptory and diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner, were he not aſſured that he was able to ſubdue the moſt powerful oppoſition, that could be made againſt the faith and doctrine which he taught.</p>

Who is not ſtruck with admiration, when he repreſents to himſelf our Saviour at that time foretelling, that his Goſpel ſhould be preached in all the world, for a witneſs unto all nations, or as St. <hi>Origen</hi> (who rather quotes the ſenſe than the words) to ſerve for a conviction to Kings and people, when at the ſame time he finds that his Goſpel has accordingly been preached to <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> to the learned and to the ignorant, and that there is no quality or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of life able to exempt men from ſubmitting to the doctrine of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> As for us, ſays this great Author, in another part of his book againſt <hi>Celſus?</hi>
                     <q rend="margQuotes">When we ſee every day thoſe events exactly accompliſhed which our Saviour foretold at ſo great a diſtance: That his Goſpel is preached in all the world, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> 24.14.

                  <p n="5">V. <hi>Origen</hi> inſiſts likewiſe with great ſtrength on that wonderful prediction of our Saviour, concerning the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at a time, as he obſerves, when there was no likelihood nor appearance of it. This has been taken notice of and inculcated by ſo many others, that I ſhall refer you to what this Father has ſaid on the ſubject in the firſt book againſt <hi>Celſus.</hi> And as to the accompliſhment of this remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0251102100:281"/>
prophecy, ſhall only obſerve, that whoever reads the account given us by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> without knowing his character, and compares it with what our Saviour foretold, would think the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian had been a Chriſtian, and that he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in view but to adjuſt the event to the prediction.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. I cannot quit this head without taking notice, that <hi>Origen</hi> would ſtill have tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed more in the foregoing arguments, had he lived an age longer, to have ſeen the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, and all their Governors and provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſubmitting themſelves to the Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and glorying in its profeſſion, as ſo many Kings and Soveraigns ſtill place their relation to <hi>Chriſt</hi> at the head of their titles.</p>
                  <p>How much greater confirmation of his faith would he have received, had he ſeen our Saviour's prophecy ſtand good in the deſtruction of the temple, and the diſſolution of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, when <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> united all their endeavours under <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, to baffle and falſifie the prediction? The great preparations that were made for rebuilding the temple, with the hurricane, earthquake, and eruptions of fire, that deſtroyed the work, and terrified thoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the attempt from proceeding in it, are related by many hiſtorians of the ſame age, and the ſubſtance of the ſtory teſtified both by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> writers, as <hi>Ammianus Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> and <hi>Zemath-David.</hi> The learned <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> in a ſermon againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> tells them this fact was then freſh in the memories even of their young men, that it happened but twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years ago, and that it was atteſted by all the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0251102100:282"/>
inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where they might ſtill ſee the marks of it in the rubbiſh of that work, from which the <hi>Jews</hi> deſiſted in ſo great a fright, and which even <hi>Julian</hi> had not the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to carry on. This fact, which is in it ſelf ſo miraculous, and ſo indiſputable, brought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver many of the <hi>Jews</hi> to Chriſtianity; and ſhows us, that after our Saviour's prophecy againſt it, the temple could not be preſerved from the plough paſſing over it, by all the care of <hi>Titus,</hi> who would fain have prevented its deſtruction, and that inſtead of being re-edified by <hi>Julian,</hi> all his endeavours towards it did but ſtill more literally accompliſh our Saviour's prediction, that not one ſtone ſhould be left upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The antient Chriſtians were ſo entirely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of the force of our Saviour's prophecies and of the puniſhment which the <hi>Jews</hi> had drawn upon themſelves, and upon their children, for the treatment which the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> had received at their hands, that they did not doubt but they would always remain an abandoned and diſperſed people, an hiſſing and an aſtoniſhment among the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they are to this day. In ſhort, that they had loſt their peculiarity of being God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which was now transferred to the body of Chriſtians, and which preſerved the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> among all the conflicts, difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and perſecutions, in which it was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as it had preſerved the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> government and oeconomy for ſo many ages, whilſt it had the ſame truth and vital principle in it, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was ſo frequently in danger of being utterly aboliſhed and deſtroyed. <hi>Origen,</hi> in his fourth

book againſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> mentioning their being caſt out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the place to which their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was annexed, deprived of their temple and ſacrifice, their religious rites and ſolemnities, and ſcattered over the face of the earth, ventures to aſſure them with a face of confidence, that they would never be re-eſtabliſhed, ſince they had committed that horrid crime againſt the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world. This was a bold aſſertion in the good man, who knew how this people had been ſo wonderfully re-eſtabliſhed in former times, when they were almoſt ſwallowed up, and in the moſt deſperate ſtate of deſolation, as in their deliverance out of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity, and the oppreſſions of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> Nay, he knew that within leſs than a hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own time, the <hi>Jews</hi> had made ſuch a powerful effort for their re-eſtabliſhment under <hi>Barchocab,</hi> in the reign of <hi>Adrian,</hi> as ſhook the whole <hi>Roman</hi> empire. But he founded his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on a ſure word of prophecy, and on the puniſhment they had ſo juſtly incurred; and we find, by a long experience of 1500 years, that he was not miſtaken, nay that his opinion gathers ſtrength daily, ſince the <hi>Jews</hi> are now at a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſtance from any probability of ſuch a re-eſtabliſhment, than they were when <hi>Origen</hi> wrote.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">I. THERE was one other means enjoyed by the learned <hi>Pagans</hi> of the three firſt centuries, for ſatisfying them in the truth of our Saviour's hiſtory, which I might have flung under one of the foregoing heads; but as it is ſo ſhining a particular, and does ſo much honour to our religion, I ſhall make a diſtinct article of it, and only conſider it with regard to the ſubject I am upon: I mean the lives and manners of thoſe holy men, who believed in <hi>Chriſt</hi> during the firſt ages of Chriſtianity. I ſhould be thought to advance a paradox, ſhould I affirm that there were More Chriſtians in the world during thoſe times of perſecution, than there are at preſent in theſe which we call the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0251102100:285"/>
flouriſhing times of Chriſtianity. But this will be found an indiſputable truth, if we form our calculation upon the opinions which prevailed in thoſe days, that every one who lives in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual practice of any voluntary ſin, actually cuts himſelf off from the benefits and profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and whatever he may call himſelf, is in reality no Chriſtian, nor ought to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſuch.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. In the times we are now ſurveying, the Chriſtian religion ſhowed its full force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy on the minds of men, and by many examples demonſtrated what great and generous ſouls it was capable of producing. It exalted and refined its proſelytes to a very high degree of perfection, and ſet them far above the pleaſures, and even the pains, of this life. It ſtrengthened the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and broke the fierceneſs of human nature. It lifted up the minds of the ignorant to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and worſhip of him that made them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired the vicious with a rational devotion, a ſtrict purity of heart, and an unbounded love to their fellow-creatures. In proportion as it ſpread through the world, it ſeemed to change mankind into another ſpecies of Beings. No ſooner was a convert initiated into it, but by an eaſy figure he became a New Man, and both acted and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon himſelf as one regenerated and born a ſecond time into another ſtate of exiſtence.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. It is not my buſineſs to be more particular in the accounts of primitive Chriſtianity, which have been exhibited ſo well by others, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to obſerve, that the <hi>Pagan</hi> converts, of whom I am now ſpeaking, mention this great refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of thoſe who had been the greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0251102100:286"/>
with that ſudden and ſurpriſing change which it made in the lives of the moſt profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, as having ſomething in it ſupernatural, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, and more than human. <hi>Origen</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents this power in the Chriſtian religion, as no leſs wonderful than that of curing the lame and blind, or cleanſing the leper. Many others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it in the ſame light, and looked upon it as an argument that there was a certain divinity in that religion, which ſhowed it ſelf in ſuch ſtrange and glorious effects.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. This therefore was a great means not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of recommending Chriſtianity to honeſt and learned heathens, but of confirming them in the belief of our Saviour's hiſtory, when they ſaw multitudes of virtuous men daily forming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon his example, animated by his precepts, and actuated by that Spirit which he had promiſed to ſend among his Diſciples.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. But I find no argument made a ſtronger impreſſion on the minds of theſe eminent <hi>Pagan</hi> converts, for ſtrengthening their faith in the hiſtory of our Saviour, than the predictions rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him in thoſe old prophetick writings, which were depoſited among the hands of the greateſt enemies to Chriſtianity, and owned by them to have been extant many ages before his appearance. The learned heathen converts were aſtoniſhed to ſee the whole hiſtory of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's life publiſhed before he was born, and to find that the Evangeliſts and Prophets, in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> differed only in point of time, the one foretelling what ſhould happen to him, and the other deſcribing thoſe very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars as what had actually happened. This our
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0251102100:287"/>
Saviour himſelf was pleaſed to make uſe of as the ſtrongeſt argument of his being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and without it would hardly have reconciled his Diſciples to the ignominy of his death, as in that remarkable paſſage which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions his converſation with the two Diſciples, on the day of his reſurrection. St. <hi>Luke,</hi> chap. 24. verſe 13. to the end.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The heathen converts, after having travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led through all human learning, and fortified their minds with the knowledge of arts and ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, were particularly qualified to examine theſe prophecies with great care and impartiality, and without prejudice or prepoſſeſſion. If the <hi>Jews</hi> on the one ſide put an unnatural interpretation on theſe prophecies, to evade the force of them in their controverſies with the Chriſtians; or if the Chriſtians on the other ſide over-ſtrained ſeveral paſſages in their applications of them, as it often happens among men of the beſt underſtanding, when their minds are heated with any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that bears a more than an ordinary weight with it: the learned Heathens may be looked upon as neuters in the matter, when all theſe prophecies were new to them, and their educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had left the interpretation of them free and indifferent. Beſides, theſe learned men among the primitive Chriſtians, knew how the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had preceded our Saviour, interpreted theſe predictions, and the ſeveral marks by which they acknowledged the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> would be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and how thoſe of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors who ſucceeded him, had deviated from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations and doctrines of their forefathers, on purpoſe to ſtifle their own conviction.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="328" facs="tcp:0251102100:288"/>VII. This ſett of arguments had therefore an invincible force with thoſe <hi>Pagan</hi> Philoſophers who became Chriſtians, as we find in moſt of their writings. They could not disbelieve our Saviour's hiſtory, which ſo exactly agreed with every thing that had been written of him many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges before his birth, nor doubt of thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances being fulfilled in him, which could not be true of any perſon that lived in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf. This wrought the greateſt confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> and the greateſt conviction in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who every where ſpeak with aſtoniſhment of theſe truths they met with in this new magazine of learning which was opened to them, and carry the point ſo far as to think whatever excellent doctrine they had met with among <hi>Pagan</hi> writers, had been ſtole from their converſation with the <hi>Jews,</hi> or from the peruſal of theſe writings which they had in their cuſtody.</p>
