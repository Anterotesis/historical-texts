            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE love of novelty, which, in ſome degree, is common to all mankind, is more particularly the characteriſtic of that mediocrity of parts, which diſtinguiſhes more than one half of the human ſpecies. This inconſtant diſpoſition is never more conſpicuous, than in what regards the article of amuſement. We change our ſentiments concerning it every moment, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance between our admiration and extreme contempt, is ſo very ſmall, that the one is almoſt a ſure preſage of the other. The poets, whoſe buſineſs it is to pleaſe, if they want to preſerve the fame they have once acquired, muſt very often forfeit their own judgments to this variable temper of the bulk of their readers, and accommodate their writings to this unſettled taſte. A fame ſo fluctuating deſerves not to be much valued.</p>
            <p>POETRY, like virtue, receives its reward after death. The fame which men purſued in vain, when living, is often beſtowed upon them when they are not ſenſible of it. This neglect of living authors is not altogether to be attributed to that reluctance which men ſhew in praiſing and rewarding genius. It often happens, that
<pb facs="tcp:0509500400:6"/>
the man who writes differs greatly from the ſame man in common life. His foibles, however, are obliterated by death, and his better part, his writings, remain: his character is formed from them, and he that was no extraordinary man in his own time, becomes the wonder of ſucceeding ages.—From this ſource proceeds our vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the dead. Their virtues remain, but the vices, which were once blended with their virtues, have died with themſelves.</p>
            <p>THIS conſideration might induce a man, diffident of his abilities, to aſcribe his own compoſitions to a perſon, whoſe remote antiquity and whoſe ſituation, when alive, might well anſwer for faults which would be inexcuſable in a writer of this age. An ingenious gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man made this obſervation, before he knew any thing but the name of the epic poem, which is printed in the following collection. When he had read it, his ſentiments were changed. He found it abounded too much with thoſe ideas, that only belong to the moſt early ſtate of ſociety, to be the work of a modern poet. Of this, I am perſuaded, the public will be as thoroughly convinced, as this gentleman was, when they ſhall ſee the poems; and that ſome will think, notwithſtanding the diſadvantages with which the works aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Oſſian appear, it would be a very uncommon inſtance of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial in me to diſown them, were they really of my compoſition.</p>
            <p>I WOULD not have dwelt ſo long upon this ſubject, eſpecially as I have anſwered all reaſonable objections to the genuineneſs of the poems in the Diſſertation, were it not on account of the prejudices of the preſent age againſt the ancient inhabitants of Britain, who are thought to have been incapable of the generous ſentiments to be met with in the poems of Oſſian.—If we err in praiſing too much the times of our forefathers, it is alſo as repugnant to good ſenſe,
<pb facs="tcp:0509500400:7"/>
to be altogether blind to the imperfections of our own. If our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had not ſo much wealth, they had certainly fewer vices than the preſent age. Their tables, it is true, were not ſo well provided, neither were their beds ſo ſoft as thoſe of modern times; and this, in the eyes of men who place their ultimate happineſs in thoſe conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of life, gives us a great advantage over them. I ſhall not enter farther into this ſubject, but only obſerve, that the general poverty of a nation has not the ſame influence, that the indigence of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, in an opulent country, has, upon the manners of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. The idea of meanneſs, which is now connected with a narrow fortune, had its riſe after commerce had thrown too much property into the hands of a ſew; for the poorer ſort, imitating the vices of the rich, were obliged to have recourſe to roguery and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvention, in order to ſupply their extravagance, ſo that they were, not without reaſon, reckoned, in more than one ſenſe, the worſt of the people.</p>
            <p>IT is now two years ſince the firſt tranſlations from the Galic language were handed about among people of taſte in Scotland. They became at laſt ſo much corrupted, through the careleſsneſs of tranſcribers, that, for my own ſake, I was obliged to print the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine copies. Some other pieces were added, to ſwell the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a pamphlet, which was entitled, Fragments of Ancient Poetry.—The Fragments, upon their firſt appearance, were ſo much approved of, that ſeveral people of rank, as well as taſte, prevailed with me to make a journey into the Highlands and weſtern iſles, in order to recover what remained of the works of the old bards, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of Oſſian, the ſon of Fingal, who was the beſt, as well as moſt ancient, of thoſe who are celebrated in tradition for their poetical genius.—I undertook this journey, more from a deſire
<pb facs="tcp:0509500400:8"/>
of complying with the requeſt of my friends, than from any hopes I had of anſwering their expectations. I was not unſuceſsful, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how much the compoſitions of ancient times have been neglected, for ſome time paſt, in the north of Scotland. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral gentlemen in the Highlands and iſles generouſly gave me all the aſſiſtance in their power; and it was by their means I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to compleat the epic poem. How far it comes up to the rules of the epopaea, is the province of criticiſm to examine. It is only my buſineſs to lay it before the reader, as I have found it. As it is one of the chief beauties of compoſition, to be well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, I ſhall here give the ſtory of the poem, to prevent that obſcurity which the introduction of characters utterly unknown might occaſion.</p>
            <p>ARTHO, ſupreme king of Ireland, dying at Temora the royal palace of the Iriſh kings, was ſucceeded by Cormac, his ſon, a minor. Cuchullin, the ſon of Semo, lord of the <hi>Iſle of Miſt,</hi> one of the Hebrides, being at that time in Ulſter, and very famous for his great exploits, was, in a convention of the petty kings and heads of tribes aſſembled for that purpoſe at Temora, unanimouſly choſen guardian to the young king.—He had not managed the affairs of Cormac long, when news was brought, that Swaran, the ſon of Starno, king of Lochlin, or Scandinavia, intended to invade Ireland. Cuchullin immediately diſpatched Munan, the ſon of Stirmal, an Iriſh chief, to Fingal, king of thoſe Caledonians who inhabited the weſtern coaſt of Scotland, to implore his aid. Fingal, as well from a principle of generoſity, as from his connection with the royal family of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, reſolved on an expedition into that country; but before his arrival, the enemy had landed in Ulſter.—Cuchullin in the mean time had gathered the flower of the Iriſh tribes to Tura, a caſtle of
<pb facs="tcp:0509500400:9"/>
Ulſter, and diſpatched ſcouts along the coaſt, to give the moſt early intelligence of the enemy.—Such is the ſituation of affairs, when the poem opens.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Fing. B. I.</note> CUCHULLIN, ſitting alone beneath a tree, at the gate of Tura, for the other chiefs had gone on a hunting party to Cromla, a neighbouring hill, is informed of Swaran's landing by Moran, the ſon of Fithil, one of his ſcouts. He convenes the chiefs; a council is held, and diſputes run high about giving battle to the enemy. Connal, the petty king of Togorma, and an intimate friend of Cuchullin, was for retreating till Fingal ſhould arrive; but Calmar, the ſon of Matha, lord of Lara, a country in Connaught, was for engaging the enemy immediately.—Cuchullin, of himſelf willing to fight, went into the opinion of Calmar. Marching towards the enemy, he miſſed three of his braveſt heroes, Fergus, Duchomar, and Caithbat. Fergus arriving, tells Cuchullin of the death of the two other chiefs; which introduces the affecting epiſode of Morna, the daughter of Cormac—The army of Cuchullin is deſcried at a diſtance by Swaran, who ſent the ſon of Arno to obſerve the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the enemy, while he himſelf ranged his forces in order of battle.—The ſon of Arno returning to Swaran, deſcribes to him Cuchullin's chariot, and the terrible appearance of that hero. The armies engage, but night coming on, leaves the victory unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided. Cuchullin, according to the hoſpitality of the times, ſends to Swaran a formal invitation to a feaſt, by his bard Carril, the ſon of Kinſena.—Swaran refuſes to come. Carril relates to Cuchullin the ſtory of Grudar and Braſſolis. A party, by Connal's advice, is ſent to obſerve the enemy; which cloſes the action of the firſt day.</p>

               <note place="margin">B. II.</note> THE ghoſt of Crugal, one of the Iriſh heroes who was killed in battle, appearing to Connal, foretels the defeat of Cuchullin in the next battle; and earneſtly adviſes him to make peace with Swaran. Connal communicates the viſion; but Cuchullin is inflexible from a principle of honour that he would not be the firſt to ſue for peace, and reſolved to continue the war. Morning comes; Swaran pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes diſhonourable terms to Cuchullin, which are rejected. The battle begins, and is obſtinately fought for ſome time, until, upon the flight of Grumal, the whole Iriſh army gave way. Cuchullin and Connal cover their retreat: Carril leads them to a neighbouring hill, whither they are ſoon followed by Cuchullin himſelf, who deſcries the fleet of Fingal making towards the coaſt; but, night coming on, he loſt ſight of it again. Cuchullin, dejected after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, attributes his ill ſucceſs to the death of Ferda his friend, whom he had killed ſome time before. Carril, to ſhew that ill ſucceſs did not always attend thoſe who innocently killed their friends, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the epiſode of Comal and Galvina.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">B. III.</note> CUCHULLIN, pleaſed with Carril's ſtory, inſiſts with him for more of his ſongs. The bard relates the actions of Fingal in Lochlin, and death of Agandecca the beautiful ſiſter of Swaran. He had ſcarce finiſhed when Calmar the ſon of Matha, who had adviſed the firſt battle, came wounded from the field, and told them of Swaran's deſign to ſurpriſe the remains of the Iriſh army. He himſelf propoſes to withſtand ſingly the whole force of the enemy, in a narrow paſs, till the Iriſh ſhould make good their retreat. Cuchullin, touched with the gallant propoſal of Calmar, reſolves to accompany him, and orders Carril to carry off the few that remained of the Iriſh. Morning comes, Calmar dies of his wounds; and, the ſhips of the Caledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians appearing, Swaran gives over the purſuit of the Iriſh, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
<pb facs="tcp:0509500400:11"/>
to oppoſe Fingal's landing. Cuchullin aſhamed, after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, to appear before Fingal, retires to the cave of Tura. Fingal engages the enemy, puts them to flight; but the coming on of night makes the victory not deciſive. The king, who had obſerved the gallant behaviour of his grandſon Oſcar, gives him advices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his conduct in peace and war. He recommends to him to place the example of his fathers before his eyes, as the beſt model for his conduct; which introduces the epiſode concerning Fainasól<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, the daughter of the king of Craca, whom Fingal had taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his protection, in his youth. Fillan and Oſcar are diſpatched to obſerve the motions of the enemy by night; Gaul the ſon of Morni deſires the command of the army, in the next battle; which Fingal promiſes to give him. The ſong of the bards cloſes the third day.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">B. IV.</note> THE action of the poem being ſuſpended by night, Oſſian takes that opportunity to relate his own actions at the lake of Lego, and his courtſhip of Evirallin, who was the mother of Oſcar, and had died ſome time before the expedition of Fingal into Ireland. Her ghoſt appears to him, and tells him that Oſcar, who had been ſent, the beginning of the night, to obſerve the enemy, was engaged with an advanced party, and almoſt overpowered. Oſſian relieves his ſon; and an alarm is given to Fingal of the approach of Swaran. The king riſes, calls his army together, and, as he had promiſed the preceding night, devolves the command on Gaul the ſon of Morni, while he himſelf, after charging his ſons to behave gallantly and defend his people, retires to a hill, from whence he could have a view of the battle. The battle joins; the poet relates Oſcar's great actions. But when Oſcar, in conjunction with his father, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered in one wing, Gaul, who was attacked by Swaran in perſon,
<pb facs="tcp:0509500400:12"/>
was on the point of retreating in the other. Fingal ſends Ullin his bard to encourage him with a war ſong, but notwithſtanding Swaran prevails; and Gaul and his army are obliged to give way. Fingal, deſcending from the hill, rallies them again: Swaran deſiſts from the purſuit, poſſeſſes himſelf of a riſing ground, reſtores the ranks, and waits the approach of Fingal. The king, having encouraged his men, gives the neceſſary orders, and renews the battle. Cuchullin, who, with his friend Connal, and Carril his bard, had retired to the cave of Tura, hearing the noiſe, came to the brow of the hill, which overlooked the field of battle, where he ſaw Fingal engaged with the enemy. He, being hindered by Connal from joining Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, who was himſelf upon the point of obtaining a complete vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, ſends Carril to congratulate that hero on his ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">B. V.</note> IN the mean time Fingal and Swaran meet; the combat is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: Swaran is overcome, bound and delivered over as a priſoner to the care of Oſſian and Gaul the ſon of Morni; Fingal, his younger ſons, and Oſcar, ſtill purſue the enemy. The epiſode of Orla a chief of Lochlin, who was mortally wounded in the battle, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced. Fingal, touched with the death of Orla, orders the purſuit to be diſcontinued; and calling his ſons together, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that Ryno, the youngeſt of them, was killed. He laments his death, hears the ſtory of Lamdarg and Gelchoſſa, and returns towards the place where he had left Swaran. Carril, who had been ſent by Cuchullin to congratulate Fingal on his victory, comes in the mean time to Oſſian. The converſation of the two poets cloſes the action of the fourth day.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">B. VI.</note> NIGHT comes on. Fingal gives a ſeaſt to his army, at which Swaran is preſent. The king commands Ullin his bard to give the
<pb facs="tcp:0509500400:13"/>
               <hi>ſong of peace;</hi> a cuſtom always obſerved at the end of a war. Ullin relates the actions of Trenmor, great grandfather to Fingal, in Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinavia, and his marriage with Inibaca, the daughter of a king of Lochlin who was anceſtor to Swaran; which conſideration, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his being brother to Agandecca, with whom Fingal was in love in his youth, induced the king to releaſe him, and permit him to return, with the remains of his army, into Lochlin, upon his promiſe of never returning to Ireland, in a hoſtile manner. The night is ſpent in ſettling Swaran's departure, in ſongs of bards, and in a converſation in which the ſtory of Grumal is introduced by Fingal. Morning comes. Swaran departs; Fingal goes on a hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party, and finding Cuchullin in the cave of Tura, comforts him, and ſets ſail, the next day, for Scotland; which concludes the poem.</p>
            <p>THE ſtory of this poem is ſo little interlarded with fable, that one cannot help thinking it the genuine hiſtory of Fingal's expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, embelliſhed by poetry. In that caſe, the compoſitions of Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian are not leſs valuable for the light they throw on the ancient ſtate of Scotland and Ireland than they are for their poetical merit. Succeeding generations founded on them all their traditions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that period; and they magnified or varied them, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they were ſwayed by credulity or deſign. The bards of Ireland, by aſcribing to Oſſian compoſitions which are evidently their own, have occaſioned a general belief, in that country, that Fingal was of Iriſh extraction, and not of the ancient Caledonians, as is ſaid in the genuine poems of Oſſian. The inconſiſtencies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe ſpurious pieces prove the ignorance of their authors. In one of them Oſſian is made to mention himſelf as baptiſed by St. Patrick, in another he ſpeaks of the famous cruſade, which was not begun in Europe for many centuries after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0509500400:14"/>
THOUGH this anachroniſm quite deſtroys the authority of the bards with reſpect to Fingal; yet their deſire to make him their countryman ſhews how famous he was in Ireland as well as in the north of Scotland.</p>
            <p>HAD the Senachies of Ireland been as well acquainted with the antiquities of their nation as they pretended, they might derive as much honour from Fingal's being a Caledonian, as if he had been an Iriſhman; for both nations were almoſt the ſame people in the days of that hero. The Celtae, who inhabited Britain and Ireland before the invaſion of the Romans, though they were divided into numerous tribes, yet, as the ſame language and cuſtoms, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of their common origin remained among them, they conſidered themſelves as one nation. After South Britain became a province of Rome, and its inhabitants begun to adopt the language and cuſtoms of their conquerors, the Celtae beyond the pale of the empire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered them as a diſtinct people, and conſequently treated them as enemies. On the other hand, the ſtricteſt amity ſubſiſted between the Iriſh and Scots Celtae for many ages, and the cuſtoms and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient language of both ſtill remaining, leave no room to doubt that they were of old one and the ſame nation.</p>
            <p>IT was at firſt intended to prefix to Oſſian's poems a diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ancient inhabitants of Britain; but as a gentleman, in the north of Scotland, who has thoroughly examined the antiquities of this iſland, and is perfectly acquainted with all the branches of the Celtic tongue, is juſt now preparing for the preſs a work on that ſubject, the curious are referred to it.</p>

            <head>A DISSERTATION CONCERNING THE ANTIQUITY, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the POEMS of OSSIAN the Son of FINGAL.</head>
            <p>INQUIRIES into the antiquities of nations afford more pleaſure than any real advantage to mankind. The ingenious may form ſyſtems of hiſtory on probabilities and a few facts; but at a great diſtance of time, their accounts muſt be vague and uncertain. The infancy of ſtates and kingdoms is as deſtitute of great events, as of the means of tranſmitting them to poſterity. The arts of poliſhed life, by which alone facts can be preſerved with certainty, are the production of a well formed community. It is then hiſtorians begin to write, and public tranſactions to be worthy remembrance. The actions of former times are left in obſcurity, or magnified by uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain traditions. Hence it is that we find ſo much of the marvellous in the origin of every nation; poſterity being always ready to believe any thing, however fabulous, that reflects honour on their anceſtors. The Greeks and Romans were remarkable for this weakneſs. They ſwallowed the moſt abſurd fables concerning the high antiquities of their reſpective nations. Good hiſtorians, however, roſe very early
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0509500400:16"/>
amongſt them, and tranſmitted, with luſtre, their great actions to poſterity. It is to them that they owe that unrivalled fame they now enjoy, while the great actions of other nations are involved in fables, or loſt in obſcurity. The Celtic nations afford a ſtriking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this kind. They, though once the maſters of Europe from the mouth of the river Oby, in Ruſſia, to Cape Finiſtere, the weſtern point of Gallicia in Spain, are very little mentioned in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.<note place="margin">

Their ancient language is the only monument that remains of them; and the traces of it being found in places ſo widely diſtant of each other, ſerves only to ſhew the extent of their ancient power, but throws very little light on their hiſtory.</p>
            <p>OF all the Celtic nations, that which poſſeſſed old Gaul is the moſt renowned; not perhaps on account of worth ſuperior to the reſt, but for their wars with a people who had hiſtorians to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the fame of their enemies, as well as their own, to poſterity. Britain was firſt peopled by them, according to the teſtimony of the beſt authors;<note place="margin">Caeſ. l. 5. Tac. Agric. l. 1. c. 2.</note> its ſituation in reſpect to Gaul makes the opinion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; but what puts it beyond all diſpute, is that the ſame cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and language prevailed among the inhabitants of both in the days of Julius Caeſar.<note place="margin">Caeſar. Pomp. Mel. Tacitus.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE colony from Gaul poſſeſſed themſelves, at firſt, of that part of Britain which was next to their own country; and ſpreading northward, by degrees, as they increaſed in numbers, peopled the whole iſland. Some adventurers paſſing over from thoſe parts of Britain that are within ſight of Ireland, were the founders of the Iriſh nation: which is a more probable ſtory than the idle fables of Mileſian and Gallician colonies. Diodorus Siculus mentions it<note place="margin">Dio. Sic. l. 5.</note> as a
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0509500400:17"/>
thing well known in his time, that the inhabitants of Ireland were originally Britons; and his teſtimony is unqueſtionable, when we conſider that, for many ages, the language and cuſtoms of both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were the ſame.</p>
            <p>TACITUS was of opinion that the ancient Caledonians were of German extract. By the language and cuſtoms which always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the North of Scotland, and which are undoubtedly Celtic, one would be tempted to differ in opinion from that celebrated wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Germans, properly ſo called, were not the ſame with the ancient Celtae. The manners and cuſtoms of the two nations were ſimilar; but their language different. <note place="margin">Strabo 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> The Germans are the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine deſcendants of the ancient Daae, afterwards well known by the name of Daci, and paſſed originally into Europe by the way of the northern countries, and ſettled beyond the Danube, towards the vaſt regions of Tranſilvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia; and from thence advanced by degrees into Germany. <note place="margin">Caeſ. l. 6. Liv. l. 5. Tac. de mor. Germ.</note> The Celtae, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſent many Colonies into that country, all of whom retained their own laws, language, and cuſtoms; and it is of them, if any colonies came from Germany into Scotland, that the ancient Caledonians were deſcended.</p>
            <p>BUT whether the Caledonians were a colony of the Celtic Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, or the ſame with the Gauls that firſt poſſeſſed themſelves of Britain, is a matter of no moment at this diſtance of time. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their origin was, we find them very numerous in the time of Julius Agricola, which is a preſumption that they were long before ſettled in the country. The form of their government was a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ariſtocracy and monarchy, as it was in all the countries where the Druids bore the chief ſway. This order of men ſeems to have been formed on the ſame ſyſtem with the Dactyli Idaei and Curetes
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0509500400:18"/>
of the ancients. Their pretended intercourſe with heaven, their magic and divination were the ſame. The knowledge of the Druids in natural cauſes, and the properties of certain things, the fruit of the experiments of ages gained them a mighty reputation among the people. The eſteem of the populace ſoon increaſed into a venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the order; which a cunning and ambitious tribe of men took care to improve, to ſuch a degree, that they, in a manner, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed the management of civil, as well as religious, matters. It is generally allowed that they did not abuſe this extraordinary power; the preſerving their character of ſanctity was ſo eſſential to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, that they never broke out into violence or oppreſſion. The chiefs were allowed to execute the laws, but the legiſlative power was entirely in the hands of the Druids. <note place="margin">Caeſ. l. 6.</note> It was by their authority that the tribes were united, in times of the greateſt danger, under one head. This temporary king, or Vergobretus,<note place="margin">Fer-gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth, <hi>the man to judge.</hi>
               </note> was choſen by them, and generally laid down his office at the end of the war. Theſe prieſts enjoyed long this extraordinary privilege among the Celtic nations who lay beyond the pale of the Roman empire. It was in the beginning of the ſecond century that their power among the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledonians begun to decline. The poems that celebrate Trathal and Cormac, anceſtors to Fingal, are full of particulars concerning the fall of the Druids, which account for the total ſilence concerning their religion in the poems that are now given to the public.</p>
            <p>THE continual wars of the Caledonians againſt the Romans hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the nobility from initiating themſelves, as the cuſtom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was, into the order of the Druids. The precepts of their religion were confined to a few, and were not much attended to by a people inured to war. The Vergobretus, or chief magiſtrate, was choſen without the concurrence of the hierarchy, or continued in his office againſt their will. Continual power ſtrengthened his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0509500400:19"/>
among the tribes, and enabled him to ſend down, as heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to his poſterity, the office he had only received himſelf by election.</p>
            <p>On occaſion of a new war againſt the <hi>King of the World,</hi> as the poems emphatically call the Roman emperor, the Druids, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the honour of the order, began to reſume their ancient privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of chuſing the Vergobretus. Garmal, the ſon of Tarno, being deputed by them, came to the grandfather of the celebrated Fingal, who was then Vergobretus, and commanded him, in the name of the whole order, to lay down his office. Upon his refuſal, a civil war commenced, which ſoon ended in almoſt the total extinction of the religious order of the Druids. A few that remained, retired to the dark receſſes of their groves, and the caves they had formerly uſed for their meditations. It is then we find them in <hi>the circle of ſtones,</hi> and unheeded by the world. A total diſregard for the order, and utter abhorrence of the Druidical rites enſued. Under this cloud of public hate, all that had any knowledge of the religion of the Druids became extinct, and the nation ſell into the laſt degree of ignorance of their rites and ceremonies.</p>
            <p>IT is no matter of wonder then, that Fingal and his ſon Oſſian make ſo little, if any, mention of the Druids; who were the declared enemies to their ſucceſſion in the ſupreme magiſtracy. It is a ſingular caſe, it muſt be allowed, that there are no traces of religion in the poems aſcribed to Oſſian; as the poetical compoſitions of other nations are ſo cloſely connected with their mythology. It is hard to account for it to thoſe who are not made acquainted with the manner of the old Scottiſh bards. That race of men carried their notions of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial honour to an extravagant pitch. Any aid given their heroes in battle, was thought to derogate from their fame; and the bards
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0509500400:20"/>
immediately transferred the glory of the action to him who had given that aid.</p>
            <p>HAD Oſſian brought down gods, as often as Homer hath done, to aſſiſt his heroes, this poem had not conſiſted of elogiums on his friends, but of hymns to theſe ſuperior beings. To this day, thoſe that write in the Galic language ſeldom mention religion in their profane poetry; and when they profeſſedly write of religion, they never interlard with their compoſitions, the actions of their heroes. This cuſtom alone, even though the religion of the Druids had not been previouſly extinguiſhed, may, in ſome meaſure, account for Oſſian's ſilence concerning the religion of his own times.</p>
            <p>To ſay, that a nation is void of all religion, is the ſame thing as to ſay, that it does not conſiſt of people endued with reaſon. The traditions of their fathers, and their own obſervations on the works of nature, together with that ſuperſtition which is inherent in the human frame, have, in all ages, raiſed in the minds of men ſome idea of a ſuperior being.—Hence it is, that in the darkeſt times, and amongſt the moſt barbarous nations, the very populace themſelves had ſome faint notion, at leaſt, of a divinity. It would be doing injuſtice to Oſſian, who, upon no occaſion, ſhews a narrow mind, to think, that he had not opened his conceptions to that primitive and greateſt of all truths. But let Oſſian's religion be what it will, it is certain he had no knowledge of Chriſtianity, as there is not the leaſt alluſion to it, or any of its rites, in his poems; which abſolutely fixes him to an aera prior to the introduction of that religion. The perſecution begun by Diocleſian, in the year 303, is the moſt probable time in which the firſt dawning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in the north of Britain can be fixed.—The humane and mild character of Conſtantius Chlorus, who commanded then in
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0509500400:21"/>
Britain, induced the perſecuted Chriſtians to take refuge under him. Some of them, through a zeal to propagate their tenets, or through fear, went beyond the pale of the Roman empire, and ſettled among the Caledonians; who were the more ready to hearken to their doctrines, as the religion of the Druids had been exploded ſo long before.</p>
            <p>THESE miſſionaries, either through choice, or to give more weight to the doctrine they advanced, took poſſeſſion of the cells and groves of the Druids; and it was from this retired life they had the name of <hi>Culdees,</hi> which in the language of the country<note place="margin">Culdich.</note> ſignified <hi>ſequeſtered perſons.</hi> It was with one of the <hi>Culdees</hi> that Oſſian, in his extreme old age, is ſaid to have diſputed concerning the Chriſtian religion. This diſpute is ſtill extant, and is couched in verſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtom of the times. The extreme ignorance on the part of Oſſian, of the Chriſtian tenets, ſhews, that that religion had only been lately introduced, as it is not eaſy to conceive, how one of the firſt rank could be totally unacquainted with a religion that had been known for any time in the country. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute bears the genuine marks of antiquity. The obſolete phraſes and expreſſions peculiar to the times, prove it to be no forgery. If Oſſian then lived at the introduction of Chriſtianity, as by all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance he did, his epoch will be the latter end of the third, and beginning of the fourth century. What puts this point beyond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, is the alluſion in his poems to the hiſtory of the times.</p>

               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0509500400:22"/>
IN the year 210 the emperor Severus, after returning from his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions againſt the Caledonians, at York fell into the tidious ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which he afterwards died. The Caledonians and Maiatae, reſuming courage from his indiſpoſition, took arms in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the poſſeſſions they had loſt. The enraged emperor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his army to march into their country, and to deſtroy it with fire and ſword. His orders were but ill executed, for his ſon, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racalla, was at the head of the army, and his thoughts were entirely taken up with the hopes of his father's death, and with ſchemes to ſupplant his brother Geta.—He ſcarcely had entered the enemy's country, when news was brought him that Severus was dead.—A ſudden peace is patched up with the Caledonians, and, as it appears from Dion Caſſius, the country they had loſt to Severus was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to them.</p>
            <p>THE Caracul of Fingal is no other than Caracalla, who, as the ſon of Severus, the Emperor of Rome, whoſe dominions were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended almoſt over the known world, was not without reaſon called in the poems of Oſſian, <hi>the Son of the King of the World.</hi> The ſpace of time between 211, the year Severus died, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fourth century, is not ſo great, but Oſſian the ſon of Fingal, might have ſeen the Chriſtians whom the perſecution under Diocleſian had driven beyond the pale of the Roman empire.</p>
            <p>OSSIAN, in one of his many lamentations on the death of his beloved ſon Oſcar, mentions among his great actions, a battle which he fought againſt Caros, king of ſhips, on the banks of the winding Carun.<note place="margin">Car-avon, <hi>Winding ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
               </note> It is more than probable, that the Caros mentioned here, is the ſame with the noted uſurper Carauſius, who aſſumed the purple in the year 287, and ſeizing on Britain, defeated the emperor Maximian Herculius, in ſeveral naval engagements, which gives propriety to
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0509500400:23"/>
his being called in Oſſian's poems, <hi>the King of Ships.</hi> The <hi>winding Carun</hi> is that ſmall river retaining ſtill the name of Carron, and runs in the neighbourhood of Agricola's wall, which Carauſius repaired to obſtruct the incurſions of the Caledonians. Several other paſſages in the poems allude to the wars of the Romans; but the two juſt mentioned clearly fix the epoch of Fingal to the third century; and this account agrees exactly with the Iriſh hiſtories, which place the death of Fingal, the ſon of Comhal, in the year 283, and that of Oſcar and their own celebrated Cairbre, in the year 296.</p>
            <p>SOME people may imagine, that the alluſions to the Roman hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory might have been induſtriouſly inſerted into the poems, to give them the appearance of antiquity. This fraud muſt then have been committed at leaſt three ages ago, as the paſſages in which the alluſions are made, are alluded to often in the compoſitions of thoſe times.</p>
            <p>EVERY one knows what a cloud of ignorance and barbariſm overſpread the north of Europe three hundred years ago. The minds of men, addicted to ſuperſtition, contracted a narrowneſs that deſtroyed genius. Accordingly we find the compoſitions of thoſe times trivial and puerile to the laſt degree. But let it be allowed, that, amidſt all the untoward circumſtances of the age, a genius might ariſe, it is not eaſy to determine what could induce him to give the honour of his compoſitions to an age ſo remote. We find no fact that he has advanced, to favour any deſigns which could be entertained by any man who lived in the fifteenth century. But ſhould we ſuppoſe a poet, through humour, or for reaſons which cannot be ſeen at this diſtance of time, would aſcribe his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to Oſſian, it is next to impoſſible, that he could impoſe
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0509500400:24"/>
upon his countrymen, when all of them were ſo well acquainted with the traditional poems of their anceſtors.</p>
            <p>THE ſtrongeſt objection to the authenticity of the poems now given to the public under the name of Oſſian, is the improbability of their being handed down by tradition through ſo many centuries. Ages of barbariſm ſome will ſay, could not produce poems abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the diſintereſted and generous ſentiments ſo conſpicuous in the compoſitions of Oſſian; and could theſe ages produce them, it is impoſſible but they muſt be loſt, or altogether corrupted in a long ſucceſſion of barbarous generations.</p>
            <p>THESE objections naturally ſuggeſt themſelves to men unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ancient ſtate of the northern parts of Britain. The bards, who were an inferior order of the Druids, did not ſhare their bad fortune. They were ſpared by the victorious king, as it was through their means only he could hope for immortality to his fame. They attended him in the camp, and contributed to eſtabliſh his power by their ſongs. His great actions were magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the populace, who had no ability to examine into his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter narrowly, were dazzled with his fame in the rhimes of the bards. In the mean time, men aſſumed ſentiments that are rarely to be met with in an age of barbariſm. The bards who were originally the diſciples of the Druids, had their minds opened, and their ideas enlarged, by being initiated in the learning of that celebrated order. They could form a perfect hero in their own minds, and aſcribe that character to their prince. The inferior chiefs made this ideal character the model of their conduct, and by degrees brought their minds to that generous ſpirit which breathes in all the poetry of the times. The prince, flattered by
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0509500400:25"/>
his bards, and rivalled by his own heroes, who imitated his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as deſcribed in the eulogies of his poets, endeavoured to excel his people in merit, as he was above them in ſtation. This emulation continuing, formed at laſt the general character of the nation, happily compounded of what is noble in barbarity, and virtuous and generous in a poliſhed people.</p>
            <p>WHEN virtue in peace, and bravery in war, are the characteriſtics of a nation, their actions become intereſting, and their fame worthy of immortality. A generous ſpirit is warmed with noble actions, and becomes ambitious of perpetuating them. This is the true ſource of that divine inſpiration, to which the poets of all ages pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. When they found their themes inadequate to the warmth of their imaginations, they varniſhed them over with fables, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by their own fancy, or furniſhed by abſurd traditions. Theſe fables, however ridiculous, had their abettors; poſterity either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly believed them, or through a vanity natural to mankind, pretended that they did. They loved to place the founders of their families in the days of fable, when poetry, without the fear of contradiction, could give what characters ſhe pleaſed of her heroes. It is to this vanity that we owe the preſervation of what remain of the works of Oſſian. His poetical merit made his heroes famous in a country where heroiſm was much eſteemed and admired. The poſterity of theſe heroes, or thoſe who pretended to be deſcended from them, heard with pleaſure the culogiums of their anceſtors; bards were employed to repeat the poems, and to record the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of their patrons with chiefs ſo renowned. Every chief in proceſs of time had a bard in his family, and the office became at laſt hereditary. By the ſucceſſion of theſe bards, the poems con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the anceſtors of the family were handed down from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to generation; they were repeated to the whole clan on
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0509500400:26"/>
ſolemn occaſions, and always alluded to in the new compoſitions o the bards. This cuſtom came down near to our own times; and after the bards were diſcontinued, a great number in a clan retained by memory, or committed to writing, their compoſitions, and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the antiquity of their families on the authority of their poems.</p>
            <p>THE uſe of letters was not known in the North of Europe till long after the inſtitution of the bards: the records of the families of their patrons, their own, and more ancient poems were handed down by tradition. Their poetical compoſitions were admirably contrived for that purpoſe. They were adapted to muſic; and the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect harmony obſerved. Each verſe was ſo connected with thoſe which preceded or followed it, that if one line had been remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſtanza, it was almoſt impoſſible to forget the reſt. The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences followed in ſo natural a gradation, and the words were ſo adapted to the common turn of the voice, after it is raiſed to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain key, that it was almoſt impoſſible, from a ſimilarity of ſound, to ſubſtitute one word for another. This excellence is peculiar to the Celtic tongue, and is perhaps to be met with in no other language. Nor does this choice of words clog the ſenſe or weaken the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The numerous flections of conſonants, and variation in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion, make the language very copious.</p>
            <p>THE deſcendants of the Celtae, who inhabited Britain and its iſles, were not ſingular in this method of preſerving the moſt precious monuments of their nation. The ancient laws of the Greeks were couched in verſe, and handed down by tradition. The Spartans, through a long habit, became ſo fond of this cuſtom, that they would never allow their laws to be committed to writing. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of great men, and the elogiums of kings and heroes were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the ſame manner. All the hiſtorical monuments of the
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0509500400:27"/>
old Germans were comprehended in their ancient ſongs; <note place="margin">Tacitus de mor. Germ.</note> which were either hymns to their gods, or elegies in praiſe of their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, and were intended to perpetuate the great events in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which were carefully interwoven them. This ſpecies of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was not committed to writing, but delivered by oral tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Abbé de la Bleterie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques ſur la Germanie.</hi>
               </note> The care they took to have the poems taught to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the uninterrupted cuſtom of repeating them upon certain oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and the happy meaſure of the verſe, ſerved to preſerve them for a long time uncorrupted. This oral chronicle of the Germans was not forgot in the eighth century, and it probably would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to this day, had not learning, which thinks every thing, that is not committed to writing, fabulous, been introduced. It was from poetical traditions that Garcillaſſo compoſed his account of the Yncas of Peru. The Peruvians had loſt all other monuments of their hiſtory, and it was from ancient poems which his mother, a princeſs of the blood of the Yncas, taught him in his youth, that he collected the materials of his hiſtory. If other nations then, that had been often overun by enemies, and had ſent abroad and received colonies, could, for many ages, preſerve, by oral tradition, their laws and hiſtories uncorrupted, it is much more probable that the ancient Scots, a people ſo free of intermixture with foreigners, and ſo ſtrongly attached to the memory of their anceſtors, had the works of their bards handed down with great purity.</p>
            <p>IT will ſeem ſtrange to ſome, that poems admired for many cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies in one part of this kingdom ſhould be hitherto unknown in the other; and that the Britiſh, who have carefully traced out the works of genius in other nations, ſhould ſo long remain ſtrangers to their own. This, in a great meaſure, is to be imputed to thoſe who underſtood both languages and never attempted a tranſlation. They, from being acquainted but with detached pieces, or from a
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0509500400:28"/>
modeſty, which perhaps the preſent tranſlator ought, in prudence, to have followed, deſpaired of making the compoſitions of their bards agreeable to an Engliſh reader. The manner of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions is ſo different from other poems, and the ideas ſo confined to the moſt early ſtate of ſociety, that it was thought they had not enough of variety to pleaſe a poliſhed age.</p>
            <p>THIS was long the opinion of the tranſlator of the following col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; and though he admired the poems, in the original, very early, and gathered part of them from tradition for his own amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet he never had the ſmalleſt hopes of ſeeing them in an Engliſh dreſs. He was ſenſible that the ſtrength and manner of both languages were very different, and that it was next to impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to tranſlate the Galic poetry into any thing of tolerable Engliſh verſe; a proſe tranſlation he could never think of, as it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily fall ſhort of the majeſty of an original. It was a gentleman, who has himſelf made a figure in the poetical world, that gave him the firſt hint concerning a literal proſe tranſlation. He tried it at his deſire, and the ſpecimen was approved. Other gentlemen were earneſt in exhorting him to bring more to the light, and it is to their uncommon zeal that the world owes the Galic poems, if they have any merit.</p>
            <p>IT was at firſt intended to make a general collection of all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient pieces of genius to be found in the Galic language; but the tranſlator had his reaſons for confining himſelf to the remains of the works of Oſſian. The action of the poem that ſtands the firſt, was not the greateſt or moſt celebrated of the exploits of Fingal. His wars were very numerous, and each of them afforded a theme which employed the genius of his ſon. But, excepting the preſent poem, thoſe pieces are irrecoverably loſt, and there only remain a few fragments
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0509500400:29"/>
in the hands of the tranſlator. Tradition has ſtill preſerved, in many places, the ſtory of the poems, and many now living have heard them, in their youth, repeated.</p>
            <p>THE complete work, now printed, would, in a ſhort time, have ſhared the fate of the reſt. The genius of the highlanders has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a great change within theſe few years. The communication with the reſt of the iſland is open, and the introduction of trade and manufactures has deſtroyed that leiſure which was formerly dedicated to hearing and repeating the poems of ancient times. Many have now learned to leave their mountains, and ſeek their fortunes in a milder climate; and though a certain <hi>amor patriae</hi> may ſometimes bring them back, they have, during their abſence, imbibed enough of foreign manners to deſpiſe the cuſtoms of their anceſtors. Bards have been long difuſed, and the ſpirit of genealogy has greatly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided. Men begin to be leſs devoted to their chiefs, and conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity is not ſo much regarded. When property is eſtabliſhed, the human mind confines its views to the pleaſure it procures. It does not go back to antiquity, or look forward to ſucceeding ages. The cares of life increaſe, and the actions of other times no longer amuſe. Hence it is, that the taſte for their ancient poetry is at a low ebb among the highlanders. They have not, however, thrown off the good qualities of their anceſtors. Hoſpitality ſtill ſubſiſts, and an uncommon civility to ſtrangers. Friendſhip is inviolable, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge leſs blindly followed than formerly.</p>
            <p>To ſay any thing, concerning the poetical merit of the poems, would be an anticipation on the judgment of the public. The poem which ſtands firſt in the collection is truly epic. The characters are ſtrongly marked, and the ſentiments breathe heroiſm. The ſubject of it is an invaſion of Ireland by Swaran king of Lochlin, which is the
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0509500400:30"/>
name of Scandinavia in the Galic language. Cuchullin, general of the Iriſh tribes in the minority of Cormac king of Ireland, upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the invaſion, aſſembled his forces near Tura, a caſtle on the coaſt of Ulſter. The poem opens with the landing of Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, councils are held, battles fought, and Cuchullin is, at laſt, totally defeated. In the mean time, Fingal, king of Scotland, whoſe aid was ſollicited before the enemy landed, arrived and expelled them from the country. This war, which continued but ſix days and as many nights, is, including the epiſodes, the whole ſtory of the poem. The ſcene is the heath of Lena near a mountain called Cromleach in Ulſter.</p>
            <p>ALL that can be ſaid of the tranſlation, is that it is literal, and that ſimplicity is ſtudied. The arrangement of the words in the original is imitated, and the inverſions of the ſtyle obſerved. As the tranſlator claims no merit from his verſion, he hopes for the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the public where he fails. He wiſhes that the imperfect ſemblance he draws, may not prejudice the world againſt an origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which contains what is beautiful in ſimplicity, and grand in the ſublime.</p>

Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chullin when very young married Bragela the daughter of Sorglan, and paſſing over into Ireland, lived for ſome time with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, grandſon by a daughter to Congal the petty king of Ulſter. His wiſdom and valour in a ſhort time gained him ſuch reputation, that in the minority of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac the ſupreme king of Ireland, he was choſen guardian to the young king, and ſole manager of the war againſt Swaran king of Lochlin. After a ſeries of great actions he was killed in battle ſomewhere in Connaught, in the twenty-ſeventh year of his age. He was ſo remarkable for his ſtrength, that to deſcribe a ſtrong man it has paſſed into a proverb, <q rend="inline">"He has the ſtrength of Cuchullin."</q> They ſhew the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of his palace at Dunſcaich in the Iſle of Skye; and a ſtone to which he bound his dog Luath, goes ſtill by his name.</note> ſat by Tura's wall; by the tree of the ruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling leaf.—His ſpear leaned againſt the moſſy rock.

We may conclude from Cuchullin's applying ſo early for foreign aid, that the Iriſh were not then ſo numerous as they have ſince been; which is a great preſumption againſt the high antiquities of that people. We have the teſtimony of Tacitus that one legion only was thought ſufficient, in the time of Agricola, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the whole iſland under the Roman yoke; which would not probably have been the caſe had the iſland been inhabited for any number of centuries before.</note> of the ocean came Moran<note n="‡" place="bottom">Moran ſignifies many; and Fithil, or rather Fili, <hi>an inferior bard.</hi>

Heroes ſtand not in my preſence: they fall to earth beneath my hand. None can meet Swaran in the fight but Fingal, king of ſtormy hills. Once we wreſtled on the heath of Malmor<note n="*" place="bottom">Meal-mór—<hi>a great hill.</hi>
                  </note>, and our heels overturned the wood. Rocks fell from their place; and rivulets, changing their courſe, fled murmuring from our ſtrife. Three days we renewed our ſtrife, and heroes ſtood at a diſtance and trembled. On the fourth, Fingal ſays, that the king of the ocean fell; but Swaran ſays, he ſtood. Let dark Cuchullin yield to him that is ſtrong as the ſtorms of Malmor.</p>
               <p>No: replied the blue-eyed chief, I will never yield to man. Dark Cuchullin will be great or dead. Go, Fithil's ſon, and take my ſpear: ſtrike the ſounding ſhield of Cabait<note n="†" place="bottom">Cabait, or rather Cathbait, grandfather to the hero, was ſo remarkable for his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, that his ſhield was made uſe of to alarm his poſterity to the battles of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.

Above they laid another ſtratum of clay, in which they placed the horn of a deer, the ſymbol of hunting. The whole was covered with a fine mold, and four ſtones placed on end to mark the extent of the grave.

CATHBAT, replied the hero, fell by the ſword of Duchomar at the oak of the noiſy ſtreams. Duchomar came to Tura's cave, and ſpoke to the lovely Morna.</p>

               <p>HE gave the ſword to her tears; but ſhe pierced his manly breaſt. He fell, like the bank of a mountain-ſtream; ſtretched out his arm and ſaid;</p>

               <p>SHE came, in all her tears, ſhe came, and drew it from his breaſt. He pierced her white ſide with ſteel; and ſpread her fair locks on the ground. Her burſting blood ſounds from her ſide: and her white arm is ſtained with red. Rolling in death ſhe lay and Tura's cave anſwered to her ſighs.—</p>

Of poliſhed yew is its beam, and its ſeat of the ſmootheſt bone. The ſides are repleniſhed with ſpears; and the bottom is the foot-ſtool of heroes. Before the right ſide of the car is ſeen the ſnorting horſe. The high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maned, broad-breaſted, proud, high-leaping ſtrong ſteed of the hill. Loud and reſounding is his hoof; the ſpreading of his mane above is like that ſtream of ſmoke on the heath. Bright are the ſides of the ſteed, and his name is Sulin-Sifadda.</p>

The thin-maned, high-headed, ſtrong-hooffed, fleet, bounding ſon of the hill: his name is Duſronnal among the ſtormy ſons of the ſword.—A thouſand thongs bind the car on high. Hard poliſhed bits ſhine in a wreath of foam. Thin thongs bright-ſtudded with gems, bend on the ſtately necks of the ſteeds.—The ſteeds that like wreaths of miſt fly over the ſtreamy vales.

The look of his blue-rolling eye is wide beneath the dark arch of his brow. His hair flies from his head like a flame, as bending forward he wields the ſpear. Fly, king of ocean, fly; he comes, like a ſtorm, along the ſtreamy vale.</p>

Were it Fingal himſelf my ſoul ſhould not darken before him.—Riſe to the battle, my thouſands; pour round me like the ecchoing main.

The hunter ſhall ſhed a tear on my ſtone; and ſorrow dwell round the high-boſomed Bragéla. I fear not death, but I fear to fly, for Fingal ſaw me often victorious. Thou dim phantom of the hill, ſhew thyſelf to me! come on thy beam of heaven, and ſhew me my death in thine hand, yet I will not fly, thou feeble ſon of the wind. Go, ſon of Colgar, ſtrike the ſhield of Caithbat, it hangs between the ſpears. Let my heroes riſe to the ſound in the midſt of the battles of Erin. Though Fingal delays his coming with the race of the ſtormy hills; we ſhall fight, O Colgar's ſon, and die in the battle of heroes.</p>
               <p>THE ſound ſpreads wide; the heroes riſe, like the breaking of a blue-rolling wave. They ſtood on the heath, like oaks with all

               <p>RISE ye, ſaid the king of the dark-brown ſhields, ye that came from Lochlin's waves. The ſons of Erin have fled from our arms—purſue them over the plains of Lena.—And, Morla, go to Cormac's hall and bid them yield to Swaran; before the people ſhall fall into the tomb; and the hills of Ullin be ſilent.—They roſe like a flock of ſea-fowl when the waves expel them from the ſhore. Their ſound was like a thouſand ſtreams that meet in Cona's vale, when after a ſtormy night, they turn their dark eddies beneath the pale light of the morning.</p>
               <p>As the dark ſhades of autumn fly over the hills of graſs; ſo gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, dark, ſucceſſive came the chiefs of Lochlin's ecchoing woods.

Go, Morla, go, ſaid Lochlin's king, and offer peace to theſe. Offer the terms we give to kings when nations bow before us. When the valiant are dead in war, and the virgins weeping on the field.</p>
               <p>GREAT Morla came, the ſon of Swart, and ſtately ſtrode the king of ſhields. He ſpoke to Erin's blue-eyed ſon, among the leſſer heroes.</p>
               <p>TAKE Swaran's peace, the warrior ſpoke, the peace he gives to kings when the nations bow before him. Leave Ullin's lovely plains to us, and give thy ſpouſe and dog. Thy ſpouſe high-boſom'd, heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fair. Thy dog that overtakes the wind. Give theſe to prove the weakneſs of thine arm, and live beneath our power.</p>
               <p>TELL Swaran, tell that heart of pride, that Cuchullin never yields.—I give him the dark-blue rolling of ocean, or I give his people graves in Erin. But never ſhall a ſtranger have the lovely ſun-beam of Dunſcaich; or ever deer fly on Lochlin's hills before the nimble-footed Luäth.</p>
               <p>VAIN ruler of the car, ſaid Morla, wilt thou fight the king; that king whoſe ſhips of many groves could carry off thine Iſle? So little is thy green-hilled Ullin to the king of ſtormy waves.</p>

               <p>O SONS of Inisfail, ſaid Grumal, Lochlin conquers on the field. Why ſtrive we as reeds againſt the wind? Fly to the hill of dark-brown hinds. He fled like the ſtag of Morven, and his ſpear is a trembling beam of light behind him. Few fled with Grumal, the chief of the little ſoul: they fell in the battle of heroes on Lena's ecchoing heath.</p>
               <p>HIGH on his car, of many gems, the chief of Erin ſtood; he ſlew a mighty ſon of Lochlin, and ſpoke, in haſte, to Connal.</p>
               <p>O CONNAL, firſt of mortal men, thou haſt taught this arm of death! Though Erin's ſons have fled, ſhall we not fight the foe? O Carril, ſon of other times, carry my living friends to that buſhy hill.—Here, Connal, let us ſtand like rocks, and ſave our flying friends.</p>
               <p>CONNAL mounts the car of light. They ſtretch their ſhields like the darkened moon, the daughter of the ſtarry ſkies, when ſhe moves, a dun circle, through heaven. Sithfadda panted up the hill, and Stronnal haughty ſteed. Like waves behind a whale behind them ruſhed the foe.</p>
               <p>Now on the riſing ſide of Cromla ſtood Erin's few ſad ſons; like a grove through which the flame had ruſhed hurried on by the winds of the ſtormy night.—Cuchullin ſtood beſide an oak. He rolled his red eye in ſilence, and heard the wind in his buſhy hair; when the ſcout of ocean came, Moran the ſon of Fithil.—The ſhips, he cried, the ſhips of the lonely iſle! There Fingal comes

               <p>BLOW, ſaid Cuchullin, all ye winds that ruſh over my iſle of lovely miſt. Come to the death of thouſands, O chief of the hills of hinds. Thy ſails, my friend, are to me like the clouds of the morning; and thy ſhips like the light of heaven; and thou thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf like a pillar of fire that giveth light in the night.

               <p>THE winds came down on the woods. The torrents ruſhed from the rocks. Rain gathered round the head of Cromla. And the red ſtars trembled between the flying clouds. Sad, by the ſide of a ſtream whoſe ſound was ecchoed by a tree, ſad by the ſide of a ſtream the chief of Erin ſat. Connal ſon of Colgar was there, and Carril of other times.</p>

DEUGALA was the ſpouſe of Cairbar, chief of the plains of Ullin. She was covered with the light of beauty, but her heart was the houſe of pride. She loved that ſun-beam of youth, the noble ſon of Damman. Cairbar, ſaid the white-armed woman, give me half of the herd. No more I will remain in your halls. Divide the herd, dark Cairbar.</p>
               <p>LET Cuchullin, ſaid Cairbar, divide my herd on the hill. His breaſt is the ſeat of juſtice. Depart, thou light of beauty. I went and divided the herd. One bull of ſnow remained. I gave that bull to Cairbar. The wrath of Deugala roſe.</p>
               <p>SON of Damman, begun the fair, Cuchullin pains my ſoul. I muſt hear of his death, or Lubar's ſtream ſhall roll over me. My pale ghoſt ſhall wander near thee, and mourn the wound of my pride. Pour out the blood of Cuchullin or pierce this heaving breaſt.</p>
               <p>DEUGALA, ſaid the fair-haired youth, how ſhall I ſlay the ſon of Semo? He is the friend of my ſecret thoughts, and ſhall I lift the ſword? She wept three days before him, on the fourth he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to fight.</p>
               <p>I WILL fight my friend, Deugala! but may I fall by his ſword. Could I wander on the hill and behold the grave of Cuchullin? We fought on the hills of Muri. Our ſwords avoid a wound. They ſlide on the helmets of ſteel; and ſound on the ſlippery ſhields. Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala was near with a ſmile, and ſaid to the ſon of Damman, thine arm is ſeeble, thou ſun-beam of youth. Thy years are not ſtrong for ſteel.—Yield to the ſon of Semo.

               <p>I SIGHED as the wind in the chink of a rock. I lifted high the edge of my ſteel. The ſun-beam of the battle fell; the firſt of Cuchullin's friends.—</p>

               <p>COMAL was a ſon of Albion; the chief of an hundred hills. His deer drunk of a thouſand ſtreams. A thouſand rocks replied to the voice of his dogs. His face was the mildneſs of youth. His hand the death of heroes. One was his love, and fair was ſhe! the daughter of mighty Conloch. She appeared like a ſun-beam among women. And her hair was like the wing of the raven. Her dogs were taught to the chace. Her bow-ſtring ſounded on the winds of the foreſt. Her ſoul was fixed on Comal. Often met their eyes of love. Their courſe in the chace was one, and happy were their words in ſecret.—But Gormal loved the maid, the dark chief of the gloomy Ardven.

               <p>HE went to the deer of Mora. The daughter of Conloch would try his love. She cloathed her white ſides with his armour, and ſtrode from the cave of Ronan. He thought it was his foe. His heart beat high. His colour changed, and darkneſs dimmed his eyes. He drew the bow. The arrow flew. Galvina fell in blood. He run with wildneſs in his ſteps and called the daughter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch. No anſwer in the lonely rock. Where are thou, O my love!

An arrow found his manly breaſt. He ſleeps with his loved Galvina at the noiſe of the ſounding ſurge. Their green tombs are ſeen by the mariner, when he bounds on the waves of the north.</p>

               <p>Go; gray-haired Snivan, Starno ſaid, to Ardven's ſea-ſurrounded rocks. Tell to Fingal king of the deſart; he that is the faireſt among his thouſands, tell him I give him my daughter, the lovelieſt maid that ever heaved a breaſt of ſnow.

               <p>SNIVAN came to Albion's windy hills: and fair-haired Fingal went. His kindled ſoul flew before him as he bounded on the waves of the north.</p>
               <p>WELCOME, ſaid the dark-brown Starno, welcome, king of rocky Morven; and ye his heroes of might; ſons of the lonely iſle! Three days within my halls ſhall ye feaſt; and three days purſue my boars, that your fame may reach the maid that dwells in the ſecret hall.</p>

THE king of ſnow<note n="*" place="bottom">Starno is here poetically called the king of ſnow, from the great quantities of ſnow that fall in his dominions.</note> deſigned their death, and gave the feaſt of ſhells. Fingal, who doubted the foe, kept on his arms of ſteel. The ſons of death were afraid, and fled from the eyes of the hero. The voice of ſprightly mirth aroſe. The trembling harps of joy are ſtrung. Bards ſing the battle of heroes; or the heaving breaſt of love.—Ullin, Fingal's bard, was there; the ſweet voice of the hill of Cona. He praiſed the daughter of the ſnow; and Morven's<note n="†" place="bottom">All the North-weſt coaſt of Scotland probably went of old under the name of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which ſignifies a ridge of very high hills.</note> high-deſcended chief.—The daughter of the ſnow overheard, and left the hall of her ſecret ſigh. She came in all her beauty, like the moon from the cloud of the eaſt.—Lovelineſs was around her as light. Her ſteps were like the muſic of ſongs. She ſaw the youth and loved him. He was the ſtolen ſigh of her ſoul. Her blue eye rolled on him in ſecret: and ſhe bleſt the chief of Morven.</p>
               <p>THE third day with all its beams, ſhone bright on the wood of boars. Forth moved the dark-browed Starno; and Fingal, king of ſhields. Half the day they ſpent in the chace; and the ſpear of Fingal was red in the blood of Gormal.</p>
               <p>IT was then the daughter of Starno, with blue eyes rolling in tears, came with her voice of love and ſpoke to the king of Morven.</p>
               <p>FINGAL, high-deſcended chief, truſt not Starno's heart of pride. Within that wood he has placed his chiefs; beware of the wood of death. But, remember, ſon of the hill, remember Agan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decca: ſave me from the wrath of my father, king of the windy Morven!</p>
               <p>

THE youth, with unconcern, went on; his heroes by his ſide. The ſons of death fell by his hand; and Gormal ecchoed around.</p>
               <p>BEFORE the halls of Starno the ſons of the chace convened. The king's dark brows were like clouds. His eyes like meteors of night. Bring hither, he cries, Agandecca to her lovely king of Morven. His hand is ſtained with the blood of my people; and her words have not been in vain.—</p>
               <p>SHE came with the red eye of tears. She came with her looſe raven locks. Her white breaſt heaved with ſighs, like the foam of the ſtreamy Lubar. Starno pierced her ſide with ſteel. She fell like a wreath of ſnow that ſlides from the rocks of Ronan; when the woods are ſtill, and the eccho deepens in the vale.</p>
               <p>THEN Fingal eyed his valiant chiefs, his valiant chiefs took arms. The gloom of the battle roared, and Lochlin fled or died.—Pale, in his bounding ſhip he cloſed the maid of the raven hair. Her tomb aſcends on Ardven, and the ſea roars round the dark dwelling of Agandecca.</p>
               <p>BLESSED be her ſoul, ſaid Cuchullin, and bleſſed be the mouth of the ſong.—Strong was the youth of Fingal, and ſtrong in his arm of age.

               <p>SUCH were the words of Cuchullin at the ſound of the mountain-ſtream, when Calmar aſcended the hill, the wounded ſon of Matha. From the field he came in his blood. He leaned on his bending ſpear. Feeble is the arm of battle! but ſtrong the ſoul of the hero!</p>
               <p>WELCOME! O ſon of Matha, ſaid Connal, welcome art thou to thy friends! Why burſts that broken ſigh from the breaſt of him that never feared before?</p>
               <p>AND never, Connal, will he fear, chief of the pointed ſteel. My ſoul brightens in danger, and exults in the noiſe of battle. I am of the race of ſteel; my fathers never feared.</p>
               <p>CORMAR was the firſt of my race. He ſported through the ſtorms of the waves. His black ſkiff bounded on ocean, and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the wings of the blaſt. A ſpirit once embroiled the night. Seas ſwell and rocks reſound. Winds drive along the clouds. The lightning flies on wings of fire. He feared and came to land: then bluſhed that he feared at all. He ruſhed again among the waves to find the ſon of the wind. Three youths guide the bounding bark; he ſtood with the ſword unſheathed. When the low-hung vapour paſſed, he took it by the curling head, and ſearched its dark womb with his ſteel. The ſon of the wind forſook the air. The moon and ſtars returned.</p>
               <p>SUCH was the boldneſs of my race; and Calmar is like his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Danger flies from the uplifted ſword. They beſt ſucceed who dare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0509500400:69"/>
BUT now, ye ſons of green-vallyed Erin, retire from Lena's bloody heath. Collect the ſad remnant of our friends, and join the ſword of Fingal. I heard the ſound of Lochlin's advancing arms; but Calmar will remain and fight. My voice ſhall be ſuch, my friends, as if thouſands were behind me. But, ſon of Semo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me. Remember Calmar's lifeleſs corſe. After Fingal has waſted the field, place me by ſome ſtone of remembrance, that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture times may hear my fame; and the mother of Calmar rejoice over the ſtone of my renown.</p>
               <p>No: ſon of Matha, ſaid Cuchullin, I will never leave thee. My joy is in the unequal field: and my ſoul increaſes in danger. Connal, and Carril of other times, carry off the ſad ſons of Erin; and when the battle is over, ſearch for our pale corſes in this narrow way. For near this oak we ſhall ſtand in the ſtream of the battle of thouſands.</p>
               <p>O FITHIL'S ſon, with feet of wind, fly over the heath of Lena. Tell to Fingal that Erin is inthralled, and bid the king of Morven haſten. O let him come like the ſun in a ſtorm, when he ſhines on the hills of graſs.</p>
               <p>MORNING is gray on Cromla; the ſons of the ſea aſcend. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar ſtood forth to meet them in the pride of his kindling ſoul. But pale was the face of the warrior; he leaned on his father's ſpear. That ſpear which he brought from Lara's hall, when the ſoul of his mother was ſad.—But ſlowly now the hero falls like a tree on the plains of Cona.

ſandy vale. The ſea comes with its waves, and roars on its harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſides. Its head is covered with foam, and the hills are ecchoing around.—Now from the gray miſt of the ocean, the white-ſailed ſhips of Fingal appear. High is the grove of their maſts as they nod, by turns, on the rolling wave.</p>
               <p>SWARAN ſaw them from the hill, and returned from the ſons of Erin. As ebbs the reſounding ſea through the hundred iſles of Inis-tore; ſo loud, ſo vaſt, ſo immenſe returned the ſons of Lochlin againſt the king of the deſart hill. But bending, weeping, ſad, and ſlow, and dragging his long ſpear behind, Cuchullin ſunk in Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's wood, and mourned his fallen friends. He feared the face of Fingal, who was wont to greet him from the fields of renown.</p>
               <p>HOW many lie there of my heroes! the chiefs of Inisfail! they that were chearful in the hall when the ſound of the ſhells aroſe. No more ſhall I find their ſteps in the heath, or hear their voice in the chace of the hinds. Pale, ſilent, low on bloody beds are they who were my friends! O ſpirits of the lately-dead, meet Cuchullin on his heath. Converſe with him on the wind, when the ruſtling tree of Tura's cave reſounds. There, far remote, I ſhall lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. No bard ſhall hear of me. No gray ſtone ſhall riſe to my renown. Mourn me with the dead, O Bragela! departed is my fame.</p>
               <p>SUCH were the words of Cuchullin when he ſunk in the woods of Cromla.</p>
               <p>FINGAL, tall in his ſhip, ſtretched his bright lance before him. Terrible was the gleam of the ſteel: it was like the green meteor of death, ſetting in the heath of Malmor, when the traveller is alone, and the broad moon is darkened in heaven.</p>

THE battle is over, ſaid the king, and I behold the blood of my friends. Sad is the heath of Lena; and mournful the oaks of Cromla: the hunters have fallen there in their ſtrength; and the ſon of Semo is no more.—Ryno and Fillan, my ſons, ſound the horn of Fingal's war. Aſcend that hill on the ſhore, and call the children of the foe. Call them from the grave of Lamdarg, the chief of other times.</p>
               <p>BE your voice like that of your father, when he enters the battles of his ſtrength. I wait for the dark mighty man; I wait on Lena's ſhore for Swaran. And let him come with all his race; for ſtrong in battle are the friends of the dead.</p>
               <p>FAIR Ryno flew like lightning; dark Fillan as the ſhade of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn. On Lena's heath their voice is heard; the ſons of ocean heard the horn of Fingal's war. As the roaring eddy of ocean re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from the kingdom of ſnows; ſo ſtrong, ſo dark, ſo ſudden came down the ſons of Lochlin. The king in their front appears in the diſmal pride of his arms. Wrath burns in his dark-brown face: and his eyes roll in the fire of his valour.</p>
               <p>FINGAL beheld the ſon of Starno; and he remembered Agan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decca.—For Swaran with the tears of youth had mourned his white-boſomed ſiſter. He ſent Ullin of the ſongs to bid him to the feaſt of ſhells. For pleaſant on Fingal's ſoul returned the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the firſt of his loves.</p>
               <p>ULLIN came with aged ſteps, and ſpoke to Starno's ſon. O thou that dwelleſt afar, ſurrounded, like a rock, with thy waves, come to the feaſt of the king, and paſs the day in reſt. To morrow let us ſight, O Swaran, and break the ecchoing ſhields.</p>

TO-DAY, ſaid Starno's wrathful ſon, we break the ecchoing ſhields: to-morrow my feaſt will be ſpread; and Fingal lie on earth.</p>
               <p>AND to-morrow let his feaſt be ſpread, ſaid Fingal with a ſmile; for to-day, O my ſons, we ſhall break the ecchoing ſhields.—Oſſian, ſtand thou near my arm. Gaul, lift thy terrible ſword. Fergus, bend thy crooked yew. Throw, Fillan, thy lance through heaven.—Lift your ſhields like the darkened moon. Be your ſpears the meteors of death. Follow me in the path of my fame; and equal my deeds in battle.</p>
               <p>AS a hundred winds on Morven; as the ſtreams of a hundred hills; as clouds fly ſucceſſive over heaven; or, as the dark ocean aſſaults the ſhore of the deſart: ſo roaring, ſo vaſt, ſo terrible the armies mixed on Lena's ecchoing heath.</p>
               <p>THE groan of the people ſpread over the hills; it was like the thunder of night, when the cloud burſts on Cona; and a thouſand ghoſts ſhriek at once on the hollow wind.</p>
               <p>FINGAL ruſhed on in his ſtrength, terrible as the ſpirit of Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; when, in a whirlwind, he comes to Morven to ſee the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his pride—The oaks reſound on their hills, and the rocks fall down before him.

Many were the deaths of my arm; and diſmal was the gleam of my ſword. My locks were not then ſo gray; nor trembled my hands of age.

               <p>WHO can relate the deaths of the people; or the deeds of mighty heroes; when Fingal, burning in his wrath, conſumed the ſons of Lochlin? Groans ſwelled on groans from hill to hill, till night had covered all. Pale, ſtaring like a herd of deer, the ſons of Lochlin convene on Lena. We ſat and heard the ſprightly harp at Lubar's gentle ſtream. Fingal himſelf was next to the foe; and liſtened to the tales of bards. His godlike race were in the ſong, the chiefs of other times. Attentive, leaning on his ſhield, the king of Morven ſat. The wind whiſtled through his aged locks, and his thoughts are of the days of other years. Near him on his bending ſpear, my young, my lovely Oſcar ſtood. He admired the king of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and his actions were ſwelling in his ſoul.</p>
               <p>SON of my ſon, begun the king, O Oſcar, pride of youth, I ſaw the ſhining of thy ſword and gloried in my race. Purſue the glory of our fathers, and be what they have been; when Trenmor lived, the firſt of men, and Trathal the father of heroes. They fought the battle in their youth, and are the ſong of bards.</p>
               <p>O OSCAR! bend the ſtrong in arm: but ſpare the feeble hand. Be thou a ſtream of many tides againſt the foes of thy people; but

I then returned from Cona's heath, and few were in my train. A white-ſailed boat appeared far off; we ſaw it like a miſt that rode on ocean's blaſt. It ſoon approached; we ſaw the fair. Her white breaſt heaved with ſighs. The wind was in her looſe dark hair: her roſy cheek had tears.</p>
               <p>DAUGHTER of beauty, calm I ſaid, what ſigh is in that breaſt? Can I, young as I am, defend thee, daughter of the ſea? My ſword is not unmatched in war, but dauntleſs is my heart.</p>
               <p>To thee I fly, with ſighs ſhe replied, O prince of mighty men! To thee I fly, chief of the generous ſhells, ſupporter of the feeble hand! The king of Craca's ecchoing iſle owned me the ſun-beam of his race. And often did the hills of Cromala reply to the ſighs of love for the unhappy Fainaſóllis. Sora's chief beheld me fair; and loved the daughter of Craca. His ſword is like a beam of light upon the warrior's ſide. But dark is his brow; and tempeſts are in his ſoul. I ſhun him on the rolling ſea; but Sora's chief purſues.</p>
               <p>Reſt thou, I ſaid, behind my ſhield; reſt in peace, thou beam of light! The gloomy chief of Sora will fly, if Fingal's arm is like his

ſoul. In ſome lone cave I might conceal thee, daughter of the ſea! But Fingal never flies; for where the danger threatens, I rejoice in the ſtorm of ſpears.</p>
               <p>I SAW the tears upon her cheek. I pitied Craca's fair.</p>
               <p>Now, like a dreadful wave afar, appeared the ſhip of ſtormy Borbar. His maſts high-bended over the ſea behind their ſheets of ſnow. White roll the waters on either ſide. The ſtrength of ocean ſounds. Come thou, I ſaid, from the roar of ocean, thou rider of the ſtorm. Partake the feaſt within my hall. It is the houſe of ſtrangers.</p>
               <p>THE maid ſtood trembling by my ſide; he drew the bow: ſhe fell. Unerring is thy hand, I ſaid, but feeble was the foe.</p>
               <p>WE fought, nor weak was the ſtrife of death. He ſunk beneath my ſword. We laid them in two tombs of ſtones; the hapleſs lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of youth.</p>
               <p>SUCH have I been in my youth, O Oſcar; be thou like the age of Fingal. Never ſearch for the battle, nor ſhun it when it comes.</p>
               <p>FILLAN and Oſcar of the dark-brown hair; ye children of the race; fly over the heath of roaring winds; and view the ſons of Lochlin. Far off I hear the noiſe of their fear, like the ſtorms of ecchoing Cona. Go: that they may not fly my ſword along the waves of the north.—For many chiefs of Erin's race lie here on the dark bed of death. The children of the ſtorm are low; the ſons of ecchoing Cromla.</p>

               <head>FINGAL, AN ANCIENT EPIC POEM.</head>
               <head>BOOK IV<note n="*" place="bottom">Fingal being aſleep, and the action ſuſpended by night, the poet introduces the ſtory of his courtſhip of Evirallin the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Branno. The epiſode is neceſſary to clear up ſeveral paſſages that follow in the poem; at the ſame time that it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally brings on the action of the book, which may be ſuppoſed to begin about the middle of the third night from the opening of the poem.—This book, as many of Oſſian's other compoſitions, is addreſſed to the beautiful Malvina the daughter of Toſcar. She appears to have been in love with Oſcar, and to have affected the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the father after the death of the ſon.</note>.</head>
               <p>WHO comes with her ſongs from the mountain, like the bow of the ſhowery Lena? It is the maid of the voice of love. The white-armed daughter of Toſcar. Often haſt thou heard my ſong, and given the tear of beauty. Doſt thou come to the battles of thy people, and to hear the actions of Oſcar? When ſhall I ceaſe to mourn by the ſtreams of the ecchoing Cona? My years have paſſed away in battle, and my age is darkened with ſorrow.</p>
               <p>DAUGHTER of the hand of ſnow! I was not ſo mournful and blind; I was not ſo dark and forlorn when Everallin loved me.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0509500400:79"/>
Everallin with the dark-brown hair, the white-boſomed love of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac. A thouſand heroes ſought the maid, ſhe denied her love to a thouſand; the ſons of the ſword were deſpiſed; for graceful in her eyes was Oſſian.</p>
               <p>I WENT in ſuit of the maid to Lego's ſable ſurge; twelve of my people were there, the ſons of the ſtreamy Morven. We came to Branno friend of ſtrangers: Branno of the ſounding mail.—From whence, he ſaid, are the arms of ſteel? Not eaſy to win is the maid that has denied the blue-eyed ſons of Erin. But bleſt be thou, O ſon of Fingal, happy is the maid that waits thee. Tho' twelve daughters of beauty were mine, thine were the choice, thou ſon of fame!—Then he opened the hall of the maid, the dark-haired Everallin. Joy kindled in our breaſts of ſteel and bleſt the maid of Branno.</p>
               <p>ABOVE us on the hill appeared the people of ſtately Cormac. Eight were the heroes of the chief; and the heath flamed with their arms. There Colla, Durra of the wounds, there mighty Toſcar, and Tago, there Freſtal the victorious ſtood; Dairo of the happy deeds, and Dala the battle's bulwark in the narrow way.—The ſword flamed in the hand of Cormac, and graceful was the look of the hero.</p>
               <p>EIGHT were the heroes of Oſſian; Ullin ſtormy ſon of war; Mullo of the generous deeds; the noble, the graceful Scelacha; Oglan, and Cerdal the wrathful, and Dumariccan's brows of death. And why ſhould Ogar be the laſt; ſo wide renowned on the hills of Ardven?</p>
               <p>OGAR met Dala the ſtrong, face to face, on the field of heroes. The battle of the chiefs was like the wind on ocean's foamy waves.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0509500400:80"/>
The dagger is remembered by Ogar; the weapon which he loved; nine times he drowned it in Dela's ſide. The ſtormy battle turned. Three times I broke on Cormac's ſhield: three times he broke his ſpear. But, unhappy youth of love! I cut his head away.—Five times I ſhook it by the lock. The friends of Cormac fled.</p>
               <p>WHOEVER would have told me, lovely maid, when then I ſtrove in battle; that blind, forſaken, and forlorn I now ſhould paſs the night; firm ought his mail to have been, and unmatched his arm in battle.</p>
               <p>Now<note n="*" place="bottom">The poet returns to his ſubject. If one could ſix the time of the year in which the action of the poem happened, from the ſcene deſcribed here, I ſhould be tempted to place it in autumn—The trees ſhed their leaves, and the winds are variable, both which circumſtances agree with that ſeaſon of the year.</note> on Lena's gloomy heath the voice of muſic died away. The unconſtant blaſt blew hard, and the high oak ſhook its leaves around me; of Everallin were my thoughts, when ſhe, in all the light of beauty, and her blue eyes rolling in tears, ſtood on a cloud before my ſight, and ſpoke with feeble voice.</p>
               <p>O OSSIAN, riſe and ſave my ſon; ſave Oſcar prince of men, near the red oak of Lubar's ſtream, he fights with Lochlin's ſons.—She ſunk into her cloud again. I clothed me with my ſteel. My ſpear ſupported my ſteps, and my rattling armour rung. I hummed, as I was wont in danger, the ſongs of heroes of old. Like diſtant thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note n="†" place="bottom">Oſſian gives the reader a high idea of himſelf. His very ſong frightens the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. This paſſage reſembles one in the eighteenth Iliad, where the voice of Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les frightens the Trojans from the body of Patroclus.

                        <l>So high his brazen voice the hero rear'd,</l>
                        <l>Hoſts drop their arms and trembled as they fear'd.</l>

                  </note> Lochlin heard; they fled; my ſon purſued.</p>

                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0509500400:81"/>
I CALLED him like a diſtant ſtream. My ſon return over Lena. No further purſue the foe, though Oſſian is behind thee.—He came; and lovely in my ear was Oſcar's ſounding ſteel. Why didſt thou ſtop my hand, he ſaid, till death had covered all? For dark and dreadful by the ſtream they met thy ſon and Fillan. They watched the terrors of the night. Our ſwords have conquered ſome. But as the winds of night pour the ocean over the white ſands of Mora, ſo dark advance the ſons of Lochlin over Lena's ruſtling heath. The ghoſts of night ſhriek afar; and I have ſeen the meteors of death. Let me awake the king of Morven, he that ſmiles in danger; for he is like the ſun of heaven that riſes in a ſtorm.</p>
               <p>FINGAL had ſtrated from a dream, and leaned on Trenmor's ſhield; the dark-brown ſhield of his fathers; which they had lifted of old in the battles of their race.</p>
               <p>MY hero had ſeen in his reſt the mournful form of Agandecca; ſhe came from the way of the ocean, and ſlowly, lonely, moved over Lena. Her face was pale like the miſt of Cromla; and dark were the tears of her cheek. She often raiſed her dim hand from her robe; her robe which was of the clouds of the deſart: ſhe raiſed her dim hand over Fingal, and turned away her ſilent eyes.</p>
               <p>WHY weeps the daughter of Starno, ſaid Fingal, with a ſigh? Why is thy face ſo pale, thou daughter of the clouds?</p>
               <p>SHE departed on the wind of Lena; and left him in the midſt of the night.—She mourned the ſons of her people that were to fall by Fingal's hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0509500400:82"/>
THE hero ſtarted from reſt, and ſtill beheld her in his ſoul.—The ſound of Oſcar's ſteps approached. The king ſaw the gray ſhield on his ſide. For the faint beam of the morning came over the waters of Ullin.</p>
               <p>WHAT do the foes in their fear, ſaid the riſing king of Morven? Or fly they through ocean's foam, or wait they the battle of ſteel? But why ſhould Fingal aſk? I hear their voice on the early wind.—Fly over Lena's heath, O Oſcar, and awake our friends to battle.</p>
               <p>THE king ſtood by the ſtone of Lubar; and thrice reared his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible voice. The deer ſtarted from the fountains of Cromla; and all the rocks ſhook on their hills. Like the noiſe of a hundred mountain-ſtreams, that burſt, and roar, and foam: like the clouds that gather to a tempeſt on the blue face of the ſky; ſo met the ſons of the deſart, round the terrible voice of Fingal. For pleaſant was the voice of the king of Morven to the warriors of his land: for often had he led them to battle, and returned with the ſpoils of the foe.</p>
               <p>COME to battle, ſaid the king, ye children of the ſtorm. Come to the death of thouſands. Comhal's ſon will ſee the fight.—My ſword ſhall wave on that hill, and be the ſhield of my people. But never may you need it, warriors; while the ſon of Morni fights, the chief of mighty men.—He ſhall lead my battle; that his fame may riſe in the ſong.</p>
               <p>O YE ghoſts of heroes dead! ye riders of the ſtorm of Cromla! receive my falling people with joy, and bring them to your hills.—And may the blaſt of Lena carry them over my ſeas, that they may come to my ſilent dreams, and delight my ſoul in reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0509500400:83"/>
FILLAN and Oſcar, of the dark-brown hair! fair Ryno, with the pointed ſteel! advance with valour to the fight; and behold the ſon of Morni. Let your ſwords be like his in the ſtrife: and behold the deeds of his hands. Protect the friends of your father: and remember the chiefs of old. My children, I will ſee you yet, though here ye ſhould fall in Erin. Soon ſhall our cold, pale ghoſts meet in a cloud, and fly over the hills of Cona.</p>
               <p>NOW like a dark and ſtormy cloud, edged round with the red lightning of heaven, and flying weſtward from the morning's beam, the king of hills removed. Terrible is the light of his armour, and two ſpears are in his hand.—His gray hair falls on the wind.—He often looks back on the war. Three bards attend the ſon of fame, to carry his words to the heroes.—High on Cromla's ſide he ſat, waving the lightning of his ſword, and as he waved we moved.</p>
               <p>JOY roſe in Oſcar's face. His cheek is red. His eye ſheds tears. The ſword is a beam of fire in his hand. He came, and ſmiling, ſpoke to Oſſian.</p>
               <p>O RULER of the fight of ſteel! my father, hear thy ſon. Retire with Morven's mighty chief; and give me Oſſian's fame. And if here I fall; my king, remember that breaſt of ſnow, that lonely ſun-beam of my love, the white-handed daughter of Toſcar. For with red cheek from the rock, and bending over the ſtream, her ſoft hair flies about her boſom as ſhe pours the ſigh for Oſcar. Tell her I am on my hills a lightly-bounding ſon of the wind; that hereafter, in a cloud, I may meet the lovely maid of Toſcar.</p>
               <p>RAISE, Oſcar, rather raiſe my tomb. I will not yield the fight to thee. For firſt and bloodieſt in the war my arm ſhall teach
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0509500400:84"/>
thee how to fight. But, remember, my ſon, to place this ſword, this bow, and the horn of my deer, within that dark and narrow houſe, whoſe mark is one gray ſtone. Oſcar, I have no love to leave to the care of my ſon; for graceful Evirallin is no more, the lovely daughter of Branno.</p>
               <p>SUCH were our words, when Gaul's loud voice came growing on the wind. He waved on high the ſword of his father, and ruſhed to death and wounds.</p>
               <p>AS waves white-bubbling over the deep come ſwelling, roaring on; as rocks of ooze meet roaring waves: ſo foes attacked and fought. Man met with man, and ſteel with ſteel. Shields ſound, men fall. As a hundred hammers on the ſon of the furnace, ſo roſe, ſo rung their ſwords.</p>
               <p>GAUL ruſhed on like a whirlwind in Ardven. The deſtruction of heroes is on his ſword. Swaran was like the fire of the deſart in the ecchoing heath of Gormal. How can I give to the ſong the death of many ſpears? My ſword roſe high, and flamed in the ſtrife of blood. And, Oſcar, terrible wert thou, my beſt, my greateſt ſon! I rejoiced in my ſecret ſoul, when his ſword flamed over the ſlain. They fled amain through Lena's heath: and we purſued and ſlew. As ſtones that bound from rock to rock; as axes in ecchoing woods; as thunder rolls from hill to hill in diſmal broken peals; ſo blow ſucceeded to blow, and death to death, from the hand of Oſcar<note n="*" place="bottom">Oſſian never fails to give a fine cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his beloved ſon. His ſpeech to his father is that of a hero; it contains the ſubmiſſion due to a parent, and the warmth that becomes a young warrior. There is a propriety in dwelling here on the actions of Oſcar, as the beautiful Malvina, to whom the book is addreſſed, was in love with that hero.</note> and mine.</p>

                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0509500400:85"/>
BUT Swaran cloſed round Morni's ſon, as the ſtrength of the tide of Iniſtore. The king half-roſe from his hill at the ſight, and half-aſſumed the ſpear. Go, Ullin, go, my aged bard, begun the king of Morven. Remind the mighty Gaul of battle; remind him of his fathers. Support the yielding fight with ſong; for ſong enlivens war. Tall Ullin went, with ſteps of age, and ſpoke to the king of ſwords.</p>
               <p>SON<note n="*" place="bottom">The war-ſong of Ullin varies from the reſt of the poem in the verſification. It runs down like a torrent; and conſiſts almoſt intirely of epithets. The cuſtom of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging men in battle with extempore rhymes, has been carried down almoſt to our own times. Several of theſe war-ſongs are extant, but the moſt of them are only a group of epithets, without beauty or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, utterly deſtitute of poetical merit.</note> of the chief of generous ſteeds! high-bounding king of ſpears. Strong arm in every perilous toil. Hard heart that never yields. Chief of the pointed arms of death. Cut down the foe; let no white ſail bound round dark Iniſtore. Be thine arm like thunder. Thine eyes like fire, thy heart of ſolid rock. Whirl round thy ſword as a meteor at night, and lift thy ſhield like the flame of death. Son of the chief of generous ſteeds, cut down the foe; deſtroy.—The hero's heart beat high. But Swaran came with battle. He cleft the ſhield of Gaul in twain; and the ſons of the deſart fled.</p>
               <p>NOW Fingal aroſe in his might, and thrice he reared his voice. Cromla anſwered around, and the ſons of the deſart ſtood ſtill.—They bent their red faces to earth, aſhamed at the preſence of Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal. He came like a cloud of rain in the days of the ſun, when ſlow it rolls on the hill, and fields expect the ſhower. Swaran be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the terrible king of Morven, and ſtopped in the midſt of his courſe. Dark he leaned on his ſpear, rolling his red eyes around. Silent and tall he ſeemed as an oak on the banks of Lubar, which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0509500400:86"/>
had its branches blaſted of old by the lightning of heaven.—It bends over the ſtream, and the gray moſs whiſtles in the wind: ſo ſtood the king. Then ſlowly he retired to the riſing heath of Lena. His thouſands pour around the hero, and the darkneſs of battle ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on the hill.</p>
               <p>FINGAL, like a beam from heaven, ſhone in the midſt of his people. His heroes gather around him, and he ſends forth the voice of his power. Raiſe my ſtandards<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>BEHOLD, ſaid the king of generous ſhells, how Lochlin divides on Lena.—They ſtand like broken clouds on the hill, or an half conſumed grove of oaks; when we ſee the ſky through its branches, and the meteor paſſing behind. Let every chief among the friends

Or Mudan's chief or I, ſaid brown-haired Dermid, ſhall ſleep on clay-cold earth.

The people of their country fell, for bloody were the blue blades of the race of my heroes. But I am ſad, forlorn, and blind; and no more the companion of heroes. Give, lovely maid, to me thy tears, for I have ſeen the tombs of all my friends.</p>
               <p>IT was then by Fingal's hand a hero fell, to his grief.—Gray-haired he rolled in the duſt, and lifted his faint eyes to the king. And is it by me thou haſt fallen, ſaid the ſon of Comhal, thou friend of Agandecca! I have ſeen thy tears for the maid of my love in the halls of the bloody Starno. Thou haſt been the foe of the foes of my love, and haſt thou fallen by my hand? Raiſe, Ullin, raiſe the grave of the ſon of Mathon; and give his name to the ſong of Agandecca; for dear to my ſoul haſt thou been, thou darkly-dwelling maid of Ardven.</p>
               <p>CUCHULLIN, from the cave of Cromla, heard the noiſe of the troubled war. He called to Connal chief of ſwords, and Carril of other times. The gray-haired heroes heard his voice, and took their aſpen ſpears.</p>

                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0509500400:89"/>
THEY came, and ſaw the tide of battle, like the crowded waves of the ocean; when the dark wind blows from the deep, and rolls the billows through the ſandy vale.</p>
               <p>CUCHULLIN kindled at the ſight, and darkneſs gathered on his brow. His hand is on the ſword of his fathers: his red-rolling eyes on the foe. He thrice attempted to ruſh to battle, and thrice did Connal ſtop him. Chief of the iſle of miſt, he ſaid, Fingal ſubdues the foe. Seek not a part of the fame of the king; himſelf is like the ſtorm.</p>
               <p>THEN, Carril, go, replied the chief, and greet the king of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. When Lochlin falls away like a ſtream after rain, and the noiſe of the battle is over. Then be thy voice ſweet in his ear to praiſe the king of ſwords. Give him the ſword of Caithbat, for Cuchullin is worthy no more to lift the arms of his fathers.</p>
               <p>BUT, O ye ghoſts of the lonely Cromla! ye ſouls of chiefs that are no more! be ye the companions of Cuchullin, and talk to him in the cave of his ſorrow. For never more ſhall I be renowned among the mighty in the land. I am like a beam that has ſhone, like a miſt that fled away; when the blaſt of the morning came, and brightened the ſhaggy ſide of the hill. Connal! talk of arms no more: departed is my fame.—My ſighs ſhall be on Cromla's wind; till my footſteps ceaſe to be ſeen.—And thou, white-boſom'd Bragela, mourn over the fall of my fame; for, vanquiſhed, I will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to thee, thou ſun-beam of Dunſcaich.</p>

The poet by putting the narration in the mouth of Connal, who ſtill remained with Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chullin on the ſide of Cromla, gives pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety to the praiſes of Fingal. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this book, in the original, is one of the moſt beautiful parts of the poem. The verſification is regular and full, and agrees very well with the ſedate character of Connal.—No poet has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apted the cadence of his verſe more to the temper of the ſpeaker, than Oſſian has done. It is more than probable that the whole poem was originally deſigned to be ſung to the harp, as the verſification is ſo various, and ſo much ſuited to the different paſſions of the human mind.</note>.</head>
               <p>NOW Connal, on Cromla's windy ſide, ſpoke to the chief of the noble car. Why that gloom, ſon of Semo? Our friends are the mighty in battle. And renowned art thou, O warrior! many were the deaths of thy ſteel. Often has Bragela met with blue-rolling eyes of joy; often has ſhe met her hero, returning in the midſt of the valiant; when his ſword was red with ſlaughter, and his foes ſilent in the fields of the tomb. Pleaſant to her ears were thy bards, when thine actions roſe in the ſong.</p>

BUT behold the king of Morven; he moves below like a pillar of fire. His ſtrength is like the ſtream of Lubar, or the wind of the ecchoing Cromla; when the branchy foreſts of night are overturned.</p>
               <p>HAPPY are thy people, O Fingal, thine arm ſhall fight their battles: thou art the firſt in their dangers; the wiſeſt in the days of their peace. Thou ſpeakeſt and thy thouſands obey; and armies tremble at the ſound of thy ſteel. Happy are thy people, Fingal, chief of the lonely hills.</p>
               <p>WHO is that ſo dark and terrible coming in the thunder of his courſe? who is it but Starno's ſon to meet the king of Morven?

The hunter hears the noiſe on his hill; and ſees the high billows advancing to Ardven's ſhore.</p>
               <p>SUCH were the words of Connal, when the heroes met in the midſt of their falling people. There was the clang of arms! there every blow, like the hundred hammers of the furnace! Terrible is the battle of the kings, and horrid the look of their eyes. Their dark-brown ſhields are cleft in twain; and their ſteel flies, broken, from their helmets.

The ſtreams are turned by their ſides, and the red ruin is ſeen afar.</p>
               <p>SONS of the king of Morven, ſaid the noble Fingal, guard the king of Lochlin; for he is ſtrong as his thouſand waves.

               <p>THEY flew like lightning over the heath. He ſlowly moved as a cloud of thunder when the ſultry plain of ſummer is ſilent. His ſword is before him as a ſun-beam, terrible as the ſtreaming meteor of night. He came toward a chief of Lochlin, and ſpoke to the ſon of the wave.</p>
               <p>WHO is that like a cloud at the rock of the roaring ſtream? He cannot bound over its courſe; yet ſtately is the chief! his boſſy ſhield is on his ſide; and his ſpear like the tree of the deſart. Youth of the dark-brown hair, art thou of Fingal's foes?</p>

               <p>OR fights or yields the hero, ſaid Fingal of the noble deeds? foes do not conquer in my preſence; but my friends are renowned in the hall. Son of the wave, follow me, partake the feaſt of my ſhells, and purſue the deer of my deſart.</p>
               <p>NO: ſaid the hero, I aſſiſt the feeble: my ſtrength ſhall remain with the weak in arms. My ſword has been always unmatched, O warrior: let the king of Morven yield.</p>
               <p>I NEVER yielded, Orla, Fingal never yielded to man. Draw thy ſword and chuſe thy foe. Many are my heroes.</p>
               <p>AND does the king refuſe the combat, ſaid Orla of the dark-brown hair? Fingal is a match for Orla: and he alone of all his race.</p>
               <p>BUT, king of Morven, if I ſhall fall; as one time the warrior muſt die; raiſe my tomb in the midſt, and let it be the greateſt on Lena. And ſend, over the dark-blue wave, the ſword of Orla to the ſpouſe of his love; that ſhe may ſhew it to her ſon, with tears, to kindle his ſoul to war.</p>
               <p>SON of the mournful tale, ſaid Fingal, why doſt thou awaken my tears? One day the warriors muſt die, and the children ſee their

               <p>THEY fought on the heath of Lena, but feeble was the arm of Orla. The ſword of Fingal deſcended, and cleft his ſhield in twain. It fell and glittered on the ground, as the moon on the ſtream of night.</p>
               <p>KING of Morven, ſaid the hero, lift thy ſword, and pierce my breaſt. Wounded and faint from battle my friends have left me here. The mournful tale ſhall come to my love on the banks of the ſtreamy Loda; when ſhe is alone in the wood; and the ruſtling blaſt in the leaves.</p>
               <p>NO; ſaid the king of Morven, I will never wound thee, Orla. On the banks of Loda let her ſee thee eſcaped from the hands of war. Let thy gray-haired father, who, perhaps, is blind with age, hear the ſound of thy voice in his hall.—With joy let the hero riſe, and ſearch for his ſon with his hands.</p>
               <p>BUT never will he find him, Fingal; ſaid the youth of the ſtreamy Loda.—On Lena's heath I ſhall die; and foreign bards will talk of me. My broad belt covers my wound of death. And now I give it to the wind.</p>
               <p>THE dark blood poured from his ſide, he fell pale on the heath of Lena. Fingal bends over him as he dies, and calls his younger heroes.</p>
               <p>OSCAR and Fillan, my ſons, raiſe high the memory of Orla. Here let the dark-haired hero reſt far from the ſpouſe of his love. Here let him reſt in his narrow houſe far from the ſound of Loda.

The ſons of the feeble will find his bow at home, but will not be able to bend it. His faithful dogs howl on his hills, and his boars, which he uſed to purſue, rejoice. Fallen is the arm of battle; the mighty among the valiant is low!</p>
               <p>EXALT the voice, and blow the horn, ye ſons of the king of Morven: let us go back to Swaran, and ſend the night away on ſong. Fillan, Oſcar, and Ryno, fly over the heath of Lena. Where, Ryno, art thou, young ſon of fame? Thou art not wont to be the laſt to anſwer thy father.</p>
               <p>RYNO, ſaid Ullin firſt of bards, is with the awful forms of his fathers. With Trathal king of ſhields, and Trenmor of the mighty deeds. The youth is low,—the youth is pale,—he lies on Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's heath.</p>
               <p>AND fell the ſwifteſt in the race, ſaid the king, the firſt to bend the bow? Thou ſcarce haſt been known to me; why did young Ryno fall? But ſleep thou ſoftly on Lena, Fingal ſhall ſoon behold thee. Soon ſhall my voice be heard no more, and my footſteps ceaſe to be ſeen. The bards will tell of Fingal's name; the ſtones will talk of me. But, Ryno, thou art low indeed,—thou haſt not received thy fame. Ullin, ſtrike the harp for Ryno; tell what the chief would have been. Farewel, thou firſt in every field. No more ſhall I direct thy dart. Thou that haſt been ſo fair; I behold thee not—Farewel.</p>
               <p>THE tear is on the cheek of the king, for terrible was his ſon in war. His ſon! that was like a beam of fire by night on the hill; when the foreſts ſink down in its courſe, and the traveller trembles at the ſound.</p>

diſtant on the ſtream; when the ſun is ſetting on Mora, and ſilence on the hill of deer. Reſt, youngeſt of my ſons, reſt, O Ryno, on Lena. We too ſhall be no more; for the warrior one day muſt fall.</p>
               <p>SUCH was thy grief, thou king of hills, when Ryno lay on earth. What muſt the grief of Oſſian be, for thou thyſelf art gone. I hear not thy diſtant voice on Cona. My eyes perceive thee not. Often forlorn and dark I ſit at thy tomb; and feel it with my hands. When I think I hear thy voice; it is but the blaſt of the deſart.—Fingal has long ſince fallen aſleep, the ruler of the war.</p>
               <p>THEN Gaul and Oſſian ſat with Swaran on the ſoft green banks of Lubar. I touched the harp to pleaſe the king. But gloomy was his brow. He rolled his red eyes towards Lena. The hero mourned his people.</p>
               <p>I LIFTED my eyes to Cromla, and I ſaw the ſon of generous Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo.—Sad and ſlow he retired from his hill towards the lonely cave of Tura. He ſaw Fingal victorious, and mixed his joy with grief. The ſun is bright on his armour, and Connal ſlowly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. They ſunk behind the hill like two pillars of the fire of night: when winds purſue them over the mountain, and the flaming heath reſounds. Beſide a ſtream of roaring foam his cave is in a rock. One tree bends above it; and the ruſhing winds eccho againſt its ſides. Here reſts the chief of Dunſcaich, the ſon of generous Semo. His thoughts are on the battles he loſt; and the tear is on his cheek. He mourned the departure of his fame that fled like the miſt of Cona. O Bragela, thou art too far remote to cheer the ſoul of the hero. But let him ſee thy bright form in his ſoul; that his thoughts may return to the lonely ſun-beam of Dunſcaich.</p>

WHO comes with the locks of age? It is the ſon of the ſongs. Hail, Carril of other times, thy voice is like the harp in the halls of Tura. Thy words are pleaſant as the ſhower that falls on the fields of the ſun. Carril of the times of old, why comeſt thou from the ſon of the generous Semo?</p>
               <p>OSSIAN king of ſwords, replied the bard, thou beſt raiſeſt the ſong. Long haſt thou been known to Carril, thou ruler of battles. Often have I touched the harp to lovely Evirallin. Thou too haſt often accompanied my voice in Branno's hall of generous ſhells. And often, amidſt our voices, was heard the mildeſt Evirallin. One day ſhe ſung of Cormac's fall, the youth that died for her love. I ſaw the tears on her cheek, and on thine, thou chief of men. Her ſoul was touched for the unhappy, though ſhe loved him not. How fair among a thouſand maids was the daughter of the generous Branno!</p>
               <p>BRING not, Carril, I replied, bring not her memory to my mind. My ſoul muſt melt at the remembrance. My eyes muſt have their tears. Pale in the earth is ſhe the ſoftly-bluſhing fair of my love.</p>
               <p>BUT ſit thou on the heath, O Bard, and let us hear thy voice. It is pleaſant as the gale of ſpring that ſighs on the hunter's ear; when he wakens from dreams of joy, and has heard the muſic of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits<note n="*" place="bottom">

The time of five days, five nights, and a part of the ſixth day is taken up in the poem. The ſcene lies in the heath of Lena, and the mountain Cromla on the coaſt of Ulſter.</note>.</head>
               <p>THE clouds of night came rolling down and reſt on Cromla's dark-brown ſteep. The ſtars of the north ariſe over the rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the waves of Ullin; they ſhew their heads of fire through the flying miſt of heaven. A diſtant wind roars in the wood; but ſilent and dark is the plain of death.</p>
               <p>STILL on the darkening Lena aroſe in my ears the tuneful voice of Carril. He ſung of the companions of our youth, and the days of former years; when we met on the banks of Lego, and ſent round the joy of the ſhell. Cromla, with its cloudy ſteeps, anſwered to his voice. The ghoſts of thoſe he ſung came in their ruſtling blaſts. They were ſeen to bend with joy towards the ſound of their praiſe.</p>

BE thy ſoul bleſt, O Carril, in the midſt of thy eddying winds. O that thou wouldſt come to my hall when I am alone by night!—And thou doſt come, my friend, I hear often thy light hand on my harp; when it hangs on the diſtant wall, and the feeble ſound touches my ear. Why doſt thou not ſpeak to me in my grief, and tell when I ſhall behold my friends? But thou paſſeſt away in thy murmuring blaſt; and thy wind whiſtles through the gray hair of Oſſian.</p>
               <p>NOW on the ſide of Mora the heroes gathered to the feaſt. A thouſand aged oaks are burning to the wind.—The ſtrength<note n="*" place="bottom">By the ſtrength of the ſhell is meant the liquor the heroes drunk: of what kind it was, cannot be aſcertained at this diſtance of time. The tranſlator has met with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ancient poems that mention wax-lights and wine as common in the halls of Fingal. The names of both are borrowed from the Latin, which plainly ſhews that our anceſtors had them from the Romans, if they had them at all.

And the ſouls of warriors brighten with joy. But the king of Lochlin is ſilent, and ſorrow reddens in the eyes of his pride. He often turned toward Lena and remembered that he fell.</p>
               <p>FINGAL leaned on the ſhield of his fathers. His gray locks ſlowly waved on the wind, and glittered to the beam of night. He ſaw the grief of Swaran, and ſpoke to the firſt of Bards.</p>
               <p>RAISE, Ullin, raiſe the ſong of peace, and ſooth my ſoul after battle, that my ear may forget the noiſe of arms. And let a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred harps be near to gladden the king of Lochlin. He muſt depart from us with joy.—None ever went ſad from Fingal. Oſcar! the

lightning of my ſword is againſt the ſtrong in battle; but peaceful it lies by my ſide when warriors yield in war.</p>
               <p>TRENMOR<note n="*" place="bottom">Trenmor was great grandfather to Fingal. The ſtory is introduced to facilitate the diſmiſſion of Swaran.</note>, ſaid the mouth of the ſongs, lived in the days of other years. He bounded over the waves of the north: companion of the ſtorm. The high rocks of the land of Lochlin, and its groves of murmuring ſounds appeared to the hero through the miſt;—he bound his white-boſomed ſails.—Trenmor purſued the boar that roared along the woods of Gormal. Many had fled from its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; but the ſpear of Trenmor ſlew it.</p>
               <p>THREE chiefs that beheld the deed, told of the mighty ſtranger. They told that he ſtood like a pillar of fire in the bright arms of his valour. The king of Lochlin prepared the feaſt, and called the blooming Trenmor. Three days he feaſted at Gormal's windy towers; and got his choice in the combat.</p>
               <p>THE land of Lochlin had no hero that yielded not to Trenmor. The ſhell of joy went round with ſongs in praiſe of the king of Morven; he that came over the waves, the firſt of mighty men.</p>
               <p>NOW when the fourth gray morn aroſe, the hero launched his ſhip; and walking along the ſilent ſhore waited for the ruſhing wind. For loud and diſtant he heard the blaſt murmuring in the grove.</p>
               <p>COVERED over with arms of ſteel a ſon of the woody Gormal appeared. Red was his cheek and fair his hair. His ſkin like the ſnow of Morven. Mild rolled his blue and ſmiling eye when he ſpoke to the king of ſwords.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0509500400:105"/>
STAY, Trenmor, ſtay thou firſt of men, thou haſt not conquered Lonval's ſon. My ſword has often met the brave. And the wiſe ſhun the ſtrength of my bow.</p>
               <p>THOU fair-haired youth, Trenmor replied, I will not fight with Lonval's ſon. Thine arm is feeble, ſun-beam of beauty. Retire to Gormal's dark-brown hinds.</p>
               <p>BUT I will retire, replied the youth, with the ſword of Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; and exult in the ſound of my fame. The virgins ſhall gather with ſmiles around him who conquered Trenmor. They ſhall ſigh with the ſighs of love, and admire the length of thy ſpear; when I ſhall carry it among thouſands, and lift the glittering point to the ſun.</p>
               <p>THOU ſhalt never carry my ſpear, ſaid the angry king of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.—Thy mother ſhall find thee pale on the ſhore of the eccho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gormal; and, looking over the dark-blue deep, ſee the fails of him that ſlew her ſon.</p>
               <p>I WILL not lift the ſpear, replied the youth, my arm is not ſtrong with years. But with the feathered dart, I have learned to pierce a diſtant foe. Throw down that heavy mail of ſteel; for Trenmor is covered all over.—I firſt, will lay my mail on earth.—Throw now thy dart, thou king of Morven.</p>
               <p>HE ſaw the heaving of her breaſt. It was the ſiſter of the king.—She had ſeen him in the halls of Gormal; and loved his face of youth.—The ſpear dropt from the hand of Trenmor: he bent his red cheek to the ground, for he had ſeen her like a beam of light
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0509500400:106"/>
that meets the ſons of the cave, when they reviſit the fields of the ſun, and bend their aching eyes.</p>
               <p>CHIEF of the windy Morven, begun the maid of the arms of ſnow; let me reſt in thy bounding ſhip, far from the love of Corlo. For he, like the thunder of the deſart, is terrible to Inibaca. He loves me in the gloom of his pride, and ſhakes ten thouſand ſpears.</p>
               <p>REST thou in peace, ſaid the mighty Trenmor, behind the ſhield of my fathers. I will not fly from the chief, though he ſhakes ten thouſand ſpears.</p>
               <p>THREE days he waited on the ſhore; and ſent his horn abroad. He called Corlo to battle from all his ecchoing hills. But Corlo came not to battle. The king of Lochlin deſcended. He feaſted on the roaring ſhore; and gave the maid to Trenmor.</p>
               <p>KING of Lochlin, ſaid Fingal, thy blood flows in the veins of thy foe. Our families met in battle, becauſe they loved the ſtrife of ſpears. But often did they feaſt in the hall; and ſend round the joy of the ſhell.—Let thy face brighten with gladneſs, and thine far delight in the harp. Dreadful as the ſtorm of thine ocean, thou haſt poured thy valour forth; thy voice has been like the voice of thouſands when they engage in battle. Raiſe, to-morrow, thy white ſails to the wind, thou brother of Agandecca. Bright as the beam of noon ſhe comes on my mournful ſoul. I have ſeen thy tears for the fair one, and ſpared thee in the halls of Starno; when my ſword was red with ſlaughter, and my eye full of tears for the maid.—Or doſt thou chuſe the fight? The combat which thy fathers gave to Trenmor is thine: that thou mayeſt depart renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like the ſun ſetting in the weſt.</p>

KING of the race of Morven, ſaid the chief of the waves of Lochlin; never will Swaran fight with thee, firſt of a thouſand heroes! I have ſeen thee in the halls of Starno, and few were thy years beyond my own.—When ſhall I, I ſaid to my ſoul, lift the ſpear like the noble Fingal? We have fought heretofore, O warrior, on the ſide of the ſhaggy Malmor; after my waves had carried me to thy halls, and the feaſt of a thouſand ſhells was ſpread. Let the bards ſend him who overcame to future years, for noble was the ſtrife of heathy Malmor.</p>
               <p>BUT many of the ſhips of Lochlin have loſt their youths on Lena. Take theſe, thou king of Morven, and be the friend of Swaran. And when thy ſons ſhall come to the moſſy towers of Gormal; the feaſt of ſhells ſhall be ſpread, and the combat offered on the vale.</p>
               <p>NOR ſhip, replied the king, ſhall Fingal take, nor land of many hills. The deſart is enough to me with all its deer and woods. Riſe on thy waves again, thou noble friend of Agandecca. Spread thy white ſails to the beam of the morning, and return to the ecchoing hills of Gormal.</p>
               <p>BLEST be thy ſoul, thou king of ſhells, ſaid Swaran of the dark-brown ſhield. In peace thou art the gale of ſpring. In war the mountain-ſtorm. Take now my hand in friendſhip, thou noble king of Morven.</p>
               <p>LET thy bards mourn thoſe who fell. Let Erin give the ſons of Lochlin to earth; and raiſe the moſſy ſtones of their fame. That the children of the north hereafter may behold the place where their fathers fought. And ſome hunter may ſay, when he leans on a

moſſy tomb, here Fingal and Swaran fought, the heroes of other years. Thus hereafter ſhall he ſay, and our fame ſhall laſt for ever.</p>
               <p>SWARAN, ſaid the king of the hills, to-day our fame is greateſt. We ſhall paſs away like a dream. No ſound will be in the fields of our battles. Our tombs will be loſt in the heath. The hunter ſhall not know the place of our reſt. Our names may be heard in the ſong, but the ſtrength of our arms will ceaſe.</p>
               <p>O OSSRAN, Carril, and Ullin, you know of heroes that are no more. Give us the ſong of other years. Let the night paſs away on the ſound, and morning return with joy.</p>
               <p>WE gave the ſong to the kings, and a hundred harps accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied our voice. The face of Swaran brightened like the full moon of heaven, when the clouds vaniſh away, and leave her calm and broad in the midſt of the ſky.</p>
               <p>IT was then that Fingal ſpoke to Carril the chief of other times. Where is the ſon of Semo; the king of the iſle of miſt? has he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, like the meteor of death, to the dreary cave of Tura?</p>
               <p>CUCHULLIN, ſaid Carril of other times, lies in the dreary cave of Tura. His hand is on the ſword of his ſtrength. His thoughts on the battles which he loſt. Mournful is the king of ſpears, for he has often been victorious. He ſends the ſword of his war to reſt on the ſide of Fingal. For, like the ſtorm of the deſart, thou haſt ſcattered all his foes. Take, O Fingal, the ſword of the hero; for his fame is departed like miſt when it flies before the ruſtling wind of the vale.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0509500400:109"/>
NO: replied the king, Fingal ſhall never take his ſword. His arm is mighty in war; and tell him his fame ſhall never fail. Many have been overcome in battle, that have ſhone afterwards like the ſun of heaven.</p>
               <p>O SWARAN, king of the reſounding woods, give all thy grief away.—The vanquiſhed, if brave, are renowned; they are like the ſun in a cloud when he hides his face in the ſouth, but looks again on the hills of graſs.</p>
               <p>GRUMAL was a chief of Cona. He ſought the battle on every coaſt. His ſoul rejoiced in blood; his ear in the din of arms. He poured his warriors on the ſounding Craca; and Craca's king met him from his grove; for then within the circle of Brumo<note n="*" place="bottom">This paſſage alludes to the religion of the king of Craca. See a note on a ſimilar ſubject in the third book.</note> he ſpoke to the ſtone of power.</p>
               <p>FIERCE was the battle of the heroes, for the maid of the breaſt of ſnow. The fame of the daughter of Craca had reached Grumal at the ſtreams of Cona; he vowed to have the white-boſomed maid, or die on the ecchoing Craca. Three days they ſtrove together, and Grumal on the fourth was bound.</p>
               <p>FAR from his friends they placed him in the horrid circle of Brumo; where often, they ſaid, the ghoſts of the dead howled round the ſtone of their fear. But afterwards he ſhone like a pillar of the light of heaven. They fell by his mighty hand, and Grumal had his fame.</p>
               <p>

RAISE, ye bards of other times, raiſe high the praiſe of heroes; that my ſoul may ſettle on their fame; and the mind of Swaran ceaſe to be ſad.</p>
               <p>THEY lay in the heath of Mora; the dark winds ruſtle over the heroes.—A hundred voices at once aroſe, a hundred harps were ſtrung; they ſung of other times, and the mighty chiefs of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer years.</p>
               <p>WHEN now ſhall I hear the bard; or rejoice at the fame of my fathers? The harp is not ſtrung on Morven; nor the voice of muſic raiſed on Cona. Dead with the mighty is the bard; and fame is in the deſart no more.</p>
               <p>MORNING trembles with the beam of the caſt, and glimmers on gray-headed Cromla. Over Lena is heard the horn of Swaran, and the ſons of the ocean gather around.—Silent and ſad they mount the wave, and the blaſt of Ullin is behind their ſails. White, as the miſt of Morven, they float along the ſea.</p>
               <p>CALL, ſaid Fingal, call my dogs, the long-bounding ſons of the chace. Call white-breaſted Bran; and the ſurly ſtrength of Luath.—Fillan, and Ryno—but he is not here; my ſon reſts on the bed of death. Fillan and Fergus, blow my horn, that the joy of the chace may ariſe; that the deer of Cromla may hear and ſtart at the lake of roes.</p>
               <p>THE ſhrill ſound ſpreads along the wood. The ſons of heathy Cromla ariſe.—A thouſand dogs fly off at once, gray-bounding
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0509500400:111"/>
through the divided heath. A deer fell by every dog, and three by the white-breaſted Bran. He brought them, in their flight, to Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, that the joy of the king might be great.</p>
               <p>ONE deer fell at the tomb of Ryno; and the grief of Fingal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. He ſaw how peaceful lay the ſtone of him who was the firſt at the chace.—No more ſhalt thou riſe, O my ſon, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the feaſt of Cromla. Soon will thy tomb be hid, and the graſs grow rank on thy grave. The ſons of the feeble ſhall paſs over it, and ſhall not know that the mighty lie there.</p>
               <p>OSSIAN and Fillan, ſons of my ſtrength, and Gaul king of the blue blades of war, let us aſcend the hill to the cave of Tura, and find the chief of the battles of Erin.—Are theſe the walls of Tura, gray and lonely they riſe on the heath? The king of ſhells is ſad, and the halls are deſolate. Come let us find the king of ſwords, and give him all our joy.</p>
               <p>BUT is that Cuchullin, O Fillan, or a pillar of ſmoke on the heath? The wind of Cromla is on my eyes, and I diſtinguiſh not my friend.</p>
               <p>FINGAL! replied the youth, it is the ſon of Semo. Gloomy and ſad is the hero; his hand is on his ſword. Hail to the ſon of battle, breaker of the ſhields!</p>
               <p>HAIL to thee, replied Cuchullin, hail to all the ſons of Morven. Delightful is thy preſence, O Fingal, it is like the ſun on Cromla; when the hunter mourns his abſence for a ſeaſon, and ſees him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

the clouds. Thy ſons are like ſtars that attend thy courſe, and give light in the night.</p>
               <p>IT is not thus thou haſt ſeen me, O Fingal, returning from the wars of the deſart; when the kings of the world<note n="*" place="bottom">This is the only paſſage in the poem, wherein the wars of Fingal againſt the Romans are alluded to:—The Roman emperor is diſtinguiſhed in old compoſition by the title of <hi>king of the world.</hi>

               <p>MANY are thy words, Cuchullin, ſaid Connan<note n="†" place="bottom">Connan was of the family of Morni.

               <p>NO hero, replied the chief, ever ſought the arms of Cuchullin; and had a thouſand heroes ſought them it were in vain, thou gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my youth. I fled not to the cave of ſorrow, as long as Erin's warriors lived.</p>
               <p>YOUTH of the feeble arm, ſaid Fingal, Connan, ſay no more. Cuchullin is renowned in battle, and terrible over the deſart. Often have I heard thy fame, thou ſtormy chief of Inisfail.

            <head>COMÁLA: A DRAMATIC POEM<note n="*" place="bottom">This poem is valuable on account of the light it throws on the antiquity of Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian's compoſitions. The Caracul men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned here is the ſame with Caracalla the ſon of Severus, who in the year 211 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an expedition againſt the Caledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.—The variety of the meaſure ſhews that the poem was originally ſet to muſic, and perhaps preſented before the chiefs upon ſolemn occaſions.—Tradition has handed down the ſtory more complete than it is in the poem—<q rend="inline">"Comala, the daughter of Sarno king of Iniſtore or Orkney iſlands, fell in love with Fingal the ſon of Comhal at a feaſt, to which her father had invited him, [Fingal, B. III.] upon his return from Lochlin, after the death of Agan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decca. Her paſſion was ſo violent, that ſhe followed him, diſguiſed like a youth, who wanted to be employed in his wars. She was ſoon diſcovered by Hidallan the ſon of Lamor, one of Fingal's heroes, whoſe love ſhe had ſlighted ſome time before—Her ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic paſſion and beauty recommended her ſo much to the king, that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make her his wife; when news was brought him of Caracul's expedition. He marched to ſtop the progreſs of the enemy, and Comala attended him.—He left her on a hill, within ſight of Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul's army, when he himſelf went to battle, having previouſly promiſed, if he ſurvived, to return that night."</q> The ſequel of the ſtory may be gathered from the poem itſelf.</note>.</head>

            <p>WHY art thou ſad? ſaid Ryno; for he alone beheld the chief. Why art thou ſad, Hidallan, haſt thou not received thy fame? The ſongs of Oſſian have been heard, and thy ghoſt has brightened in the wind, when thou didſt bend from thy cloud to hear the ſong of Morven's bard.</p>
            <p>AND do thine eyes behold the hero, ſaid Oſcar, like the dim meteor of night? Say, Ryno, ſay, how fell the chief that was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in the days of our fathers?—His name remains on the rocks of Cona; and I have often ſeen the ſtreams of his hills.</p>
            <p>FINGAL, replied the bard, had driven Hidallan from his wars. The king's ſoul was ſad for Comala, and his eyes could not behold Hidallan.</p>

LONELY, ſad along the heath he ſlowly moved with ſilent ſteps. His arms hang diſordered on his ſide. His hair flies looſe from his helmet. The tear is in his down-caſt eyes; and the ſigh half-ſilent in his breaſt.</p>
            <p>THREE days he ſtrayed unſeen, alone, before he came to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor's halls: the moſſy halls of his fathers, at the ſtream of Balva<note n="*" place="bottom"> This is perhaps that ſmall ſtream, ſtill retaining the name of Balva, which runs through the romantic valley of Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivar in Stirlingſhire.

               </note>.—There Lamor ſat alone beneath a tree; for he had ſent his people with Hidallan to war. The ſtream ran at his feet, and his gray head reſted on his ſtaff. Sightleſs are his aged eyes. He hums the ſong of other times.—The noiſe of Hidallan's feet came to his ear: he knew the tread of his ſon.</p>
            <p>IS the ſon of Lamor returned; or is it the ſound of his ghoſt? Haſt thou fallen on the banks of Carun, ſon of the aged Lamor? Or, if I hear the ſound of Hidallan's feet; where are the mighty in the war? where are my people, Hidallan, that were wont to return with their echoing ſhields?—Have they fallen on the banks of Carun?</p>
            <p>NO: replied the ſighing youth, the people of Lamor live. They are renowned in battle, my father; but Hidallan is renowned no more. I muſt ſit alone on the banks of Balva, when the roar of the battle grows.</p>
            <p>BUT thy fathers never ſat alone, replied the riſing pride of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; they never ſat alone on the banks of Balva, when the roar of battle roſe.—Doſt thou not behold that tomb? My eyes diſcern

it not; there reſts the noble Garmállon who never fled from war.—Come, thou renowned in battle, he ſays, come to thy father's tomb.—How am I renowned, Garmállon, for my ſon has fled from war?</p>
            <p>KING of the ſtreamy Balva! ſaid Hidallan with a ſigh, why doſt thou torment my ſoul? Lamor, I never feared.—Fingal was ſad for Comala, and denied his wars to Hidallan; go to the gray ſtreams of thy land, he ſaid, and moulder like a leafleſs oak, which the winds have bent over Balva, never more to grow.</p>
            <p>AND muſt I hear, Lamor replied, the lonely tread of Hidallan's feet? When thouſands are renowned in battle, ſhall he bend over my gray ſtreams? Spirit of the noble Garmállon! carry Lamor to his place; his eyes are dark; his ſoul is ſad; and his ſon has loſt his fame.</p>
            <p>WHERE, ſaid the youth, ſhall I ſearch for ſame to gladden the ſoul of Lamor? From whence ſhall I return with renown, that the ſound of my arms may be pleaſant in his ear?—If I go to the chace of hinds, my name will not be heard.—Lamor will not feel my dogs, with his hands, glad at my arrival from the hill. He will not enquire of his mountains, or of the dark-brown deer of his deſarts.</p>
            <p>I MUST fall, ſaid Lamor, like a leafleſs oak: it grew on a rock, but the winds have overturned it.—My ghoſt will be ſeen on my hills, mournful for my young Hidallan. Will not ye, ye miſts, as ye riſe, hide him from my ſight?—My ſon!—go to Lamor's hall: there the arms of our fathers hang.—Bring the ſword of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mállon;—he took it from a foe.</p>

HE went and brought the ſword with all its ſtudded thongs.—He gave it to his father. The gray-haired hero felt the point with his hand.—</p>
            <p>MY ſon!—lead me to Garmállon's tomb: it riſes beſide that ruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling tree. The long graſs is withered;—I heard the breeze whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there.—A little fountain murmurs near, and ſends its water to Balva. There let me reſt; it is noon: and the ſun is on our fields.</p>
            <p>HE led him to Garmállon's tomb. Lamor pierced the ſide of his ſon.—They ſleep together: and their ancient halls moulder on Balva's banks.—Ghoſts are ſeen there at noon: the valley is ſilent, and the people ſhun the place of Lamor.</p>
            <p>MOURNFUL is thy tale, ſaid Oſcar, ſon of the times of old!—My ſoul ſighs for Hidallan; he fell in the days of his youth. He flies on the blaſt of the deſart, and his wandering is in a foreign land.—</p>
            <p>SONS of the ecchoing Morven! draw near to the foes of Fingal. Send the night away in ſongs; and watch the ſtrength of Caros. Oſcar goes to the people of other times; to the ſhades of ſilent Ard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; where his fathers ſit dim in their clouds, and behold the future war.—And art thou there, Hidallan, like a half-extinguiſhed meteor? Come to my ſight, in thy ſorrow, chief of the roaring Balva!</p>
            <p>THE heroes move with their ſongs.—Oſcar ſlowly aſcends the hill.—The meteors of night ſet on the heath before him. A diſtant torrent faintly roars.—Unfrequent blaſts ruſh through aged oaks. The half-enlightened moon ſinks dim and red behind her hill.—Feeble voices are heard on the heath.—Oſcar drew his ſword.</p>

COME, ſaid the hero, O ye ghoſts of my fathers! ye that fought againſt the kings of the world!—Tell me the deeds of future times; and your converſe in your caves; when you talk together and behold your ſons in the fields of the valiant.</p>
            <p>TRENMOR came, from his hill, at the voice of his mighty ſon.—A cloud, like the ſteed of the ſtranger, ſupported his airy limbs. His robe is of the miſt of Lano, that brings death to the people. His ſword is a green meteor half-extinguiſhed. His face is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out form, and dark.

Many were his words to Oſcar: but they only came by halves to our ears: they were dark as the tales of other times, before the light of the ſong aroſe.

            <p>OSCAR ſtood at the tomb, and raiſed thrice his terrible voice. The rocking hills ecchoed around: the ſtarting roes bounded away.

            <p>OUR youth is like the dream of the hunter on the hill of heath.

               </note> in the light of my ſteel?—Come, with your ſtreams, ye hills of Cona, and liſten to the voice of Oſſian! The ſong riſes, like the ſun, in my ſoul; and my heart feels the joys of other times.</p>
            <p>I BEHOLD thy towers, O Selma! and the oaks of thy ſhaded wall:—thy ſtreams ſound in my ear; thy heroes gather round. Fingal ſits in the midſt; and leans on the ſhield of Trenmor:—his

ſpear ſtands againſt the wall; he liſtens to the ſong of his bards.—The deeds of his arm are heard; and the actions of the king in his youth.</p>
            <p>OSCAR had returned from the chace, and heard the hero's praiſe.—He took the ſhield of Branno<note n="*" place="bottom">This is Branno, the father of Everal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, and grandfather to Oſcar; he was of Iriſh extraction and lord of the country round the lake of Lego.—His great actions are handed down by tradition, and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitality has paſſed into a proverb.</note> from the wall; his eyes were filled with tears. Red was the cheek of youth. His voice was trembling, low. My ſpear ſhook its bright head in his hand: he ſpoke to Morven's king.</p>
            <p>FINGAL! thou king of heroes! Oſſian, next to him in war! ye have fought the battle in your youth; your names are renowned in the ſong.—Oſcar is like the miſt of Cona; I appear and vaniſh.—The bard will not know my name.—The hunter will not ſearch in the heath for my tomb. Let me fight, O heroes, in the battles of Inis-thona. Diſtant is the land of my war!—ye ſhall not hear of Oſcar's fall.—Some bard may find me there, and give my name to the ſong.—The daughter of the ſtranger ſhall ſee my tomb, and weep over the youth that came from afar. The bard ſhall ſay, at the feaſt, hear the ſong of Oſcar from the diſtant land!</p>
            <p>OSCAR, replied the king of Morven; thou ſhalt fight, ſon of my fame!—Prepare my dark-boſomed ſhip to carry my hero to Inis-thona. Son of my ſon, regard our fame;—for thou art of the race of renown. Let not the children of ſtrangers ſay, feeble are the ſons of Morven!—Be thou, in battle, like the roaring ſtorm: mild as the evening ſun in peace.—Tell, Oſcar, to Inis-thona's king, that Fingal remembers his youth; when we ſtrove in the combat together in the days of Agandecca.</p>

THEY lifted up the ſounding ſail; the wind whiſtled through the thongs<note n="*" place="bottom">Leather thongs were uſed in Oſſian's time, inſtead of ropes.</note> of their maſts. Waves laſhthe oozy rocks: the ſtrength of ocean roars.—My ſon beheld, from the wave, the land of groves. He ruſhed into the ecchoing bay of Runa; and ſent his ſword to Annir king of ſpears.</p>
            <p>THE gray-haired hero roſe, when he ſaw the ſword of Fingal. His eyes were full of tears, and he remembered the battles of their youth. Twice they lifted the ſpear before the lovely Agandecca: heroes ſtood far diſtant, as if two ghoſts contended.</p>
            <p>BUT now, begun the king, I am old; the ſword lies uſeleſs in my hall. Thou who art of Morven's race! Annir has been in the ſtrife of ſpears; but he is pale and withered now, like the oak of Lano. I have no ſon to meet thee with joy, or to carry thee to the halls of his fathers. Argon is pale in the tomb, and Ruro is no more.—My daughter is in the hall of ſtrangers, and longs to behold my tomb.—Her ſpouſe ſhakes ten thouſand ſpears; and comes<note n="†" place="bottom">Cormalo had reſolved on a war againſt his father in law Annir king of Inis thona, in order to deprive him of his kingdom: the injuſtice of his deſigns was ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by Fingal, that he ſent his grandſon, Oſcar, to the aſſiſtance of Annir.

CORMALO, replied the king, is chief of ten thouſand ſpears; he dwells at the dark-rolling waters of Lano<note n="*" place="bottom">Lano was a lake of Scandinavia, remarkable, in the days of Oſſian, for emitting a peſtilential vapour in autumn. <q rend="inline">

               </note>; which ſent forth the cloud of death. He came to Runa's ecchoing halls, and ſought the honour of the ſpear<note n="†" place="bottom">By <hi>the honour of the ſpear</hi> is meant the tournament practiſed among the ancient northern nations.</note>. The youth was lovely as the firſt beam of the ſun; and few were they who could meet him in fight!—My heroes yielded to Cormalo: and my daughter loved the ſon of Lano.</p>
            <p>ARGON and Ruro returned from the chace; the tears of their pride deſcend:—They rolled their ſilent eyes on Runa's heroes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they yielded to a ſtranger: three days they feaſted with Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malo: on the fourth my Argon fought.—But who could fight with Argon!—Lano's chief is overcome. His heart ſwelled with the grief of pride, and he reſolved, in ſecret, to behold the death of my ſons.</p>
            <p>THEY went to the hills of Runa, and purſued the dark-brown hinds. The arrow of Cormalo flew in ſecret; and my children fell. He came to the maid of his love; to Inis-thona's dark-haired maid.—They fled over the deſart—and Annir remained alone.</p>
            <p>NIGHT came on and day appeared; nor Argon's voice, nor Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's came. At length their much-loved dog is ſeen; the fleet and bounding Runar. He came into the hall and howled; and ſeemed to look towards the place of their fall.—We followed him: we found them here: and laid them by this moſſy ſtream. This is the haunt of Annir, when the chace of the hinds is over. I bend like the trunk of an aged oak above them: and my tears for ever flow.</p>

O RONNAN! ſaid the riſing Oſcar, Ogar king of ſpears! call my heroes to my ſide, the ſons of ſtreamy Morven. To-day we go to Lano's water, that ſends forth the cloud of death. Cormalo will not long rejoice: death is often at the point of our ſwords.</p>
            <p>THEY came over the deſart like ſtormy clouds, when the winds roll them over the heath: their edges are tinged with lightning: and the ecchoing groves foreſee the ſtorm. The horn of Oſcar's battle is heard; and Lano ſhook over all its waves. The children of the lake convened around the ſounding ſhield of Cormalo.</p>
            <p>OSCAR fought, as he was wont in battle. Cormalo fell beneath his ſword: and the ſons of the diſmal Lano fled to their ſecret vales.—Oſcar brought the daughter of Inis-thona to Annir's ecchoing halls. The face of age is bright with joy; he bleſt the king of ſwords.</p>
            <p>HOW great was the joy of Oſſian, when he beheld the diſtant ſail of his ſon! it was like a cloud of light that riſes in the eaſt, when the traveller is ſad in a land unknown; and diſmal night, with her ghoſts, is ſitting around him.</p>
            <p>WE brought him, with ſongs, to Selma's halls. Fingal ordered the feaſt of ſhells to be ſpread. A thouſand bards raiſed the name of Oſcar: and Morven anſwered to the noiſe. The daughter of Toſcar was there, and her voice was like the harp; when the diſtant ſound comes, in the evening, on the ſoft-ruſtling breeze of the vale.</p>
            <p>O LAY me, ye that ſee the light, near ſome rock of my hills: let the thick hazels be around, let the ruſtling oak be near. Green be the place of my reſt; and let the ſound of the diſtant torrent be heard. Daughter of Toſcar, take the harp, and raiſe the lovely

ſong of Selma; that ſleep may overtake my ſoul in the midſt of joy; that the dreams of my youth may return, and the days of the mighty Fingal.</p>
            <p>SELMA! I behold thy towers, thy trees, and ſhaded wall. I ſee the heroes of Morven; and hear the ſong of bards. Oſcar lifts the ſword of Cormalo; and a thouſand youths admire its ſtudded thongs. They look with wonder on my ſon; and admire the ſtrength of his arm. They mark the joy of his father's eyes; they long for an equal fame.</p>
            <p>AND ye ſhall have your fame, O ſons of ſtreamy Morven.—My ſoul is often brightened with the ſong; and I remember the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of my youth.—But ſleep deſcends with the ſound of the harp; and pleaſant dreams begin to riſe.

TWO heroes were forgot at our feaſt; and the rage of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms burned. They rolled their red eyes in ſecret: the ſigh burſts from their breaſts. They were ſeen to talk together, and to throw their ſpears on earth. They were two dark clouds, in the midſt of our joy; like pillars of miſt on the ſettled ſea: it glitters to the ſun, but the mariners fear a ſtorm.</p>
            <p>RAISE my white ſails, ſaid Ma-ronnan, raiſe them to the winds of the weſt; let us ruſh, O Aldo, through the foam of the northern wave. We are forgot at the feaſt: but our arms have been red in blood. Let us leave the hills of Fingal, and ſerve the king of Sora.—His countenance is fierce, and the war darkens round his ſpear. Let us be renowned, O Aldo, in the battles of ecchoing Sora.</p>
            <p>THEY took their ſwords and ſhields of thongs; and ruſhed to Lumar's ſounding bay. They came to Sora's haughty king, the chief of bounding ſteeds.—Erragon had returned from the chace: his ſpear was red in blood. He bent his dark face to the ground: and whiſtled as he went.—He took the ſtrangers to his feaſts: they fought and conquered in his wars.</p>
            <p>ALDO returned with his fame towards Sora's lofty walls.—From her tower looked the ſpouſe of Erragon, the humid, rolling eyes of Lorma.—Her dark-brown hair flies on the wind of ocean: her white breaſt heaves, like ſnow on heath; when the gentle winds ariſe, and ſlowly move it in the light. She ſaw young Aldo, like the beam of Sora's ſetting ſun. Her ſoft heart ſighed: tears filled her eyes; and her white arm ſupported her head.</p>
            <p>THREE days ſhe ſat within the hall, and covered grief with joy.—On the fourth ſhe fled with the hero, along the rolling ſea.—They came to Cona's moſſy towers, to Fingal king of ſpears.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0509500400:142"/>
ALDO of the heart of pride! ſaid the riſing king of Morven, ſhall I defend thee from the wrath of Sora's injured king? who will now receive my people into their halls, or give the feaſt of ſtrangers, ſince Aldo, of the little ſoul, has carried away the fair of Sora? Go to thy hills, thou feeble hand, and hide thee in thy caves; mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is the battle we muſt fight, with Sora's gloomy king.—Spirit of the noble Trenmor! When will Fingal ceaſe to fight? I was born in the midſt of battles<note n="*" place="bottom">Comhal the Father of Fingal was ſlain in battle, againſt the tribe of Morni, the very day that Fingal was born; ſo that he may, with propriety, be ſaid to have been <hi>born in the midſt of battles.</hi>
               </note>, and my ſteps muſt move in blood to my tomb. But my hand did not injure the weak, my ſteel did not touch the feeble in arms.—I behold thy tempeſts, O Morven, which will overtrun my halls; when my children are dead in battle, and none remains to dwell in Selma. Then will the feeble come, but they will not know my tomb: my renown is in the ſong: and my actions ſhall be as a dream to future times.</p>
            <p>HIS people gathered around Erragon, as the ſtorms round the ghoſt of night; when he calls them from the top of Morven, and prepares to pour them on the land of the ſtranger.—He came to the ſhore of Cona, and ſent his bard to the king; to demand the combat of thouſands; or the land of many hills.</p>
            <p>FINGAL ſat in his hall with the companions of his youth around him. The young heroes were at the chace, and far diſtant in the deſart. The gray-haired chiefs talked of other times, and of the actions of their youth; when the aged Narthmor<note n="†" place="bottom">Neart-mór, <hi>great ſtrength.</hi> Lora, <hi>noiſy.</hi>
               </note> came, the king of ſtreamy Lora.</p>
            <p>THIS is no time, begun the chief, to hear the ſongs of other years: Erragon frowns on the coaſt, and lifts ten thouſand ſwords. Gloomy
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0509500400:143"/>
is the king among his chiefs! he is like the darkened moon, amidſt the meteors of night.</p>
            <p>COME, ſaid Fingal, from thy hall, thou daughter of my love; come from thy hall, Boſmina<note n="*" place="bottom">Boſ-mhina, <hi>ſoft and tender hand.</hi> She was the youngeſt of Fingal's children.</note>, maid of ſtreamy Morven!

            <p>SHE came to the hoſt of Erragon, like a beam of light to a cloud.—In her right hand ſhone an arrow of gold: and in her left a ſparkling ſhell, the ſign of Morven's peace.</p>
            <p>ERRAGON brightened in her preſence as a rock, before the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den beams of the ſun; when they iſſue from a broken cloud, divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the roaring wind.</p>
            <p>SON of the diſtant Sora, begun the mildly bluſhing maid, come to the feaſt of Morven's king, to Selma's ſhaded walls. Take the peace of heroes, O warrior, and let the dark ſword reſt by thy ſide.—And if thou chuſeſt the wealth of kings, hear the words of the generous Aldo.—He gives to Erragon an hundred ſteeds, the children of the rein; an hundred maids from diſtant lands; an hundred hawks with fluttering wing, that fly acroſs the ſky. An hundred girdles<note n="‡" place="bottom">Sanctified girdles, till very lately, were kept in many families in the north of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; they were bound about women in labour, and were ſuppoſed to alleviate their pains, and to accelerate the birth. They were impreſſed with ſeveral myſtical fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and the ceremony of binding them about the woman's waiſt, was accompanied with words and geſtures which ſhewed the cuſtom to have come originally from the druids.</note> ſhall alſo be thine, to bind high-boſomed women; the friends of <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0509500400:144"/>
the births of heroes, and the cure of the ſons of toil.—Ten ſhells ſtudded with gems ſhall ſhine in Sora's towers: the blue water trembles on their ſtars, and ſeems to be ſparkling wine.—They gladdened once the kings of the world<note n="*" place="bottom">The Roman emperors. Theſe ſhells were ſome of the ſpoils of the province.</note>, in the midſt of their ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choing halls. Theſe, O hero, ſhall be thine; or thy white-boſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpouſe.—Lorma ſhall roll her bright eyes in thy halls; though Fingal loves the generous Aldo:—Fingal!—who never injured a hero, though his arm is ſtrong.</p>
            <p>SOFT voice of Cona! replied the king, tell him, that he ſpreads his feaſt in vain.—Let Fingal pour his ſpoils around me; and bend beneath my power. Let him give me the ſwords of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the ſhields of other times; that my children may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them in my halls, and ſay, <q rend="inline">"Theſe are the arms of Fingal."</q>
            </p>
            <p>NEVER ſhall they behold them in thy halls, ſaid the riſing pride of the maid; they are in the mighty hands of heroes who never yielded in war.—King of the ecchoing Sora! the ſtorm is gathering on our hills. Doſt thou not foreſee the fall of thy people, ſon of the diſtant land?</p>
            <p>SHE came to Selma's ſilent halls; the king beheld her down-caſt eyes. He roſe from his place, in his ſtrength, and ſhook his aged locks.—He took the ſounding mail of Trenmor, and the dark-brown ſhield of his fathers. Darkneſs filled Selma's hall, when he ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hand to his ſpear:—the ghoſts of thouſands were near, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0509500400:145"/>
foreſaw the death of the people. Terrible joy roſe in the face of the aged heroes: they ruſhed to meet the foe; their thoughts are on the actions of other years: and on the fame of the tomb.</p>
            <p>NOW the dogs of the chace appeared at Trathal's tomb: Fingal know that his young heroes followed them, and he ſtopt in the midſt of his courſe.—Oſcar appeared the firſt;—then Morni's ſon, and Nemi's race:—Fercuth<note n="*" place="bottom">Fear-cuth, the ſame with Fergus, <hi>the man of the word,</hi> or a commander of an army.</note> ſhewed his gloomy form: Dermid ſpread his dark hair on the wind.

            <p>THE king of Morven ſat on his hill: the ſun-beam<note n="‖" place="bottom"> I have obſerved in a former note, that the ſtandard of Fingal was called the ſun-beam from its being ſtudded with ſtones and gold.</note> of battle flew on the wind: the companions of his youth are near, with all their waving locks of age.—Joy roſe in the hero's eyes when he beheld his ſons in war; when he ſaw them amidſt the lightning of ſwords, and mindful of the deeds of their fathers.—Erragon came on, in his ſtrength, like the roar of a winter ſtream: the battle falls in his courſe, and death is at his ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0509500400:146"/>
WHO comes, ſaid Fingal, like the bounding roe, like the hart of ecchoing Cona? His ſhield glitters on his ſide; and the clang of his armour is mournful.—He meets with Erragon in the ſtrife!—Behold the battle of the chiefs!—it is like the contending of ghoſts in a gloomy ſtorm.—But falleſt thou, ſon of the hill, and is thy white boſom ſtained with blood? Weep, unhappy Lorma, Aldo is no more.</p>
            <p>THE king took the ſpear of his ſtrength; for he was ſad for the fall of Aldo: he bent his deathful eyes on the foe; but Gaul met the king of Sora.—Who can relate the fight of the chiefs?—The mighty ſtranger fell.</p>
            <p>SONS of Cona! Fingal cried aloud, ſtop the hand of death.—Mighty was he that is now ſo low! and much is he mourned in Sora! The ſtranger will come towards his hall, and wonder why it is ſilent. The king is fallen, O ſtranger, and the joy of his houſe is ceaſed.—Liſten to the ſound of his woods: perhaps his ghoſt is there; but he is far diſtant, on Morven, beneath the ſword of a foreign foe.</p>
            <p>SUCH were the words of Fingal, when the bard raiſed the ſong of peace; we ſtopped our uplifted ſwords, and ſpared the feeble foe. We laid Erragon in that tomb; and I raiſed the voice of grief: the clouds of night came rolling down, and the ghoſt of Erragon appeared to ſome.—His face was cloudy and dark; and an half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſormed ſigh is in his breaſt.—Bleſt be thy ſoul, O king of Sora! thine arm was terrible in war!</p>
            <p>Lorma ſat, in Aldo's hall, at the light of a flaming oak: the night came, but he did not return; and the ſoul of Lorma is ſad.—What detains thee, hunter of Cona? for thou didſt promiſe to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0509500400:147"/>
return.—Has the deer been diſtant far; and do the dark winds ſigh, round thee, on the heath? I am in the land of ſtrangers, where is my friend, but Aldo? Come from thy ecchoing hills, O my beſt beloved!</p>
            <p>HER eyes are turned toward the gate, and ſhe liſtens to the ruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling blaſt. She thinks it is Aldo's tread, and joy riſes in her ſace:—but ſorrow returns again, like a thin cloud on the moon.—And thou wilt not return, my love? Let me behold the face of the hill. The moon is in the eaſt. Calm and bright is the breaſt of the lake! When ſhall I behold his dogs returning from the chace? When ſhall I hear his voice, loud and diſtant on the wind? Come from thy ecchoing hills, hunter of woody Cona!</p>
            <p>HIS thin ghoſt appeared, on a rock, like the watry beam of the moon, when it ruſhes from between two clouds, and the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night ſhower is on the field.—She followed the empty ſorm over the heath, for ſhe knew that her hero fell.—I heard her approaching cries on the wind, like the mournſul voice of the breeze, when it ſighs on the graſs of the cave.</p>
            <p>SHE came, ſhe found her hero: her voice was heard no more: ſilent ſhe rolled her ſad eyes; ſhe was pale as a watry cloud, that riſes from the lake, to the beam of the moon.</p>

            <head>CONLATH and CUTHÓNA: A POEM<note n="*" place="bottom">Conlath was the youngeſt of Morni's ſons, and brother to the celebrated Gaul, who is ſo often mentioned in Oſſian's poems. He was in love with Cuthóna the daughter of Rumar, when Toſcar the ſon of Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fena, accompanied by Fercuth his friend, arrived, from Ireland, at Mora where Conlath dwelt. He was hoſpitably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and according to the cuſtom of the times, feaſted, three days, with Conlath. On the fourth he ſet fail, and coaſting the <hi>iſland of waves,</hi> probably, one of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brides, he ſaw Cuthóna hunting, fell in love with her, and carried her away, by force, in his ſhip. He was forced, by ſtreſs of weather, into I-thona a deſart iſle. In the mean-time Conlath, hearing of the rape, ſailed after him, and found him on the point of ſailing for the coaſt of Ireland. They fought; and they, and their followers fell by mutual wounds. Cuthóna did not long ſurvive: for ſhe died of grief the third day after. Fingal, hearing of their unfortunate death, ſent Stormal the ſon of Moran to bury them, but forgot to ſend a bard to ſing the funeral ſong over their tombs. The ghoſt of Conlath came, long after, to Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, to intreat him to tranſmit, to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, his and Cuthona's fame. For it was the opinion of the times, that the ſouls of the deceaſed were not happy, till their elegies were compoſed by a bard.—Thus is the ſtory of the poem handed down by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note>.</head>

The ſons of little men are aſleep, and the midnight wind is in my hall. Perhaps it is the ſhield of Fingal that echoes to the blaſt, it hangs in Oſſian's hall, and he feels

            <head>CARTHON<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>This poem is compleat, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it, as of moſt of Oſſian's compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tragical. In the time of Comhal the ſon of Trathal, and father of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Fingal, Cleſsámmor the ſon of Thaddu and brother of Morna, Fingal's mother, was driven by a ſtorm into the river Clyde, on the banks of which ſtood Balclutha, a town belonging to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons between the walls. He was hoſpitably received by Reuthámir, the principal man in the place, who gave him Moina his only daughter in marriage. Reuda, the ſon of Cormo, a Briton who was in love with Moina, came to Reuthamir's houſe, and behaved haughtily towards Cleſsámmor. A quarrel inſued, in which Reuda was killed; the Britons, who attended him preſſed ſo hard on Cleſsámmor, that he was obliged to throw himſelf into the Clyde, and ſwim to his ſhip. He hoiſted ſail, and the wind being favourable, bore him out to ſea. He often endeavoured to return, and carry off his beloved Moina by night; but the wind continuing contrary, he was forced to deſiſt.</p>
                  <p>Moina, who had been left with child by her huſband, brought forth a ſon, and died ſoon after.—Reuthamir named the child Carthon, <hi>i. e. the murmur of waves,</hi> from the ſtorm which carried off Cleſsámmor his father, who was ſuppoſed to have been caſt away. When Carthon was three years old, Comhal the father of Fingal, in one of his expeditions againſt the Britons, took and burnt Balclutha. Reuthámir was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the attack: and Carthon was carried ſafe away by his nurſe, who fled farther into the country of the Britons. Carthon, coming to man's eſtate was reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the fall of Balclutha on Comhal's poſterity. He ſet ſail, from the Clyde, and, falling on the coaſt of Morven, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated two of Fingal's heroes, who came to oppoſe his progreſs. He was, at laſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly killed by his father Cleſsámmor, in a ſingle combat. This ſtory is the foundation of the preſent poem, which opens on the night preceding the death of Carthon, ſo that what paſſed before is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by way of epiſode. The poem is addreſſed to Malvina the daughter of Toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car.</p>

            <p>A TALE of the times of old! The deeds of days of other years!—The murmur of thy ſtreams, O Lora, brings back the memory of the paſt. The ſound of thy woods, Garmallar, is lovely in mine ear. Doſt thou not behold, Malvina, a rock with its head of heath? Three aged firs bend from its face; green is the narrow plain at its feet; there the flower of the mountain grows,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0509500400:156"/>
and ſhakes its white head in the breeze. The thiſtle is there alone, and ſhades its aged beard. Two ſtones, half ſunk in the ground, ſhew their heads of moſs. The deer of the mountain avoids the place, for he beholds the gray ghoſt that guards it<note n="*" place="bottom">It was the opinion of the times, that deer ſaw the ghoſts of the dead.

A tale of the times of old! the deeds of days of other years!</p>
            <p>WHO comes from the land of ſtrangers, with his thouſands around him? the ſun-beam pours its bright ſtream before him; and his hair meets the wind of his hills. His face is ſettled from war. He is calm as the evening beam that looks, from the cloud of the weſt, on Cona's ſilent vale. Who is it but Comhal's ſon<note n="†" place="bottom">Fingal returns here, from an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Romans, which was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by Oſſian in a poem called <hi>the ſtrife of Crona.</hi>

a lighter ſpear. O that my joy would return, as when I firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the maid; the white boſomed daughter of ſtrangers, Moina<note n="*" place="bottom">Moina, <hi>ſoft in temper and perſon.</hi> We find the Britiſh names in this poem derived from the Galic, which is a proof that the ancient language of the whole iſland was one and the ſame.</note> with the dark-blue eyes!</p>

            <p>IT was in the days of peace, replied the great Cleſsámmor, I came, in my bounding ſhip, to Balclutha's<note n="†" place="bottom">Balclutha, <hi>i. e. the town of Clyde,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the <hi>Alduth</hi> of Bede.</note> walls of towers.

Three days I remained in Reuthámir's halls, and ſaw that beam of light, his daughter. The joy of the ſhell went round, and the aged hero gave the fair. Her breaſts were like foam on the wave, and her eyes like ſtars of light: her hair was dark as the raven's wing: her ſoul was generous and mild. My love for Moina was great: and my heart poured forth in joy.</p>
            <p>THE ſon of a ſtranger came; a chief who loved the white-boſomed Moina. His words were mighty in the hall, and he often half-unſheathed his ſword.—Where, he ſaid, is the mighty Comhal, the reſtleſs wanderer<note n="‖" place="bottom">The word in the original here rendered by <hi>reſtleſs wanderer,</hi> is <hi>Scuta,</hi> which is the true origin of the <hi>Scoti</hi> of the Romans; an opprobrious name impoſed by the Britons, on the Caledonians, on account of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual incurſions into their country.</note> of the heath?

MY Soul, I replied, O warrior! burns in a light of its own. I ſtand without fear in the midſt of thouſands, though the valiant are diſtant far.—Stranger! thy words are mighty, for Cleſſammor is alone. But my ſword trembles by my ſide, and longs to glitter in my hand.—Speak no more of Comhal, ſon of the winding Clutha!</p>
            <p>THE ſtrength of his pride aroſe. We fought; he fell beneath my ſword. The banks of Clutha heard his fall, and a thouſand ſpears glittered around. I fought: the ſtrangers prevailed: I plunged into the ſtream of Clutha. My white ſails roſe over the waves, and I bounded on the dark-blue ſea.—Moina came to the ſhore, and rolled the red eye of her tears: her dark hair flew on the wind; and I heard her cries.—Often did I turn my ſhip! but the winds of the Eaſt prevailed. Nor Clutha ever ſince have I ſeen: nor Moina of the dark brown hair.—She fell in Balclutha: for I have ſeen her ghoſt.

may reſt with the fair of Morven, the ſun-beams of other days, and the delight of heroes of old.—I have ſeen the walls<note n="*" place="bottom">The reader may compare this paſſage with the three laſt verſes of the 13th chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Iſaiah, where the prophet foretels the deſtruction of Babylon.</note> of Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clutha, but they were deſolate. The fire had reſounded in the halls: and the voice of the people is heard no more. The ſtream of Clutha was removed from its place, by the fall of the walls.—The thiſtle ſhook, there, its lonely head: the moſs whiſtled to the wind. The fox looked out, from the windows, the rank graſs of the wall waved round his head.—Deſolate is the dwelling of Moina, ſilence is in the houſe of her fathers.—Raiſe the ſong of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, O bards, over the land of ſtrangers. They have but fallen before us: for, one day, we muſt fall.—Why doſt thou build the hall, ſon of the winged days? Thou lookeſt from thy towers to-day; yet a few years, and the blaſt of the deſart comes; it howls in thy empty court, and whiſtles round thy half-worn ſhield.—And let the blaſt of the deſart come! we ſhall be renowned in our day. The mark of my arm ſhall be in the battle, and my name in the ſong of bards.—Raiſe the ſong; ſend round the ſhell: and let joy be heard in my hall.—When thou, ſun of heaven, ſhalt fail! if thou ſhalt fail, thou mighty light! if thy brightneſs is for a ſeaſon, like Fingal; our fame ſhall ſurvive thy beams.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the ſong of Fingal, in the day of his joy. His thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand bards leaned forward from their ſeats, to hear the voice of the king. It was like the muſic of the harp on the gale of the ſpring.—Lovely were thy thoughts, O Fingal! why had not Oſſian the ſtrength of thy ſoul?—But thou ſtandeſt alone, my father; and who can equal the king of Morven?</p>

THE night paſſed away in the ſong, and morning returned in joy;—the mountains ſhewed their gray heads; and the blue face of ocean ſmiled.—The white wave is ſeen tumbling round the diſtant rock; the gray miſt riſes, ſlowly, from the lake. It came, in the figure of an aged man, along the ſilent plain. Its large limbs did not move in ſteps; for a ghoſt ſupported it in mid air. It came towards Selma's hall, and diſſolved in a ſhower of blood.</p>
            <p>THE king alone beheld the terrible ſight, and he foreſaw the death of the people. He came, in ſilence, to his hall; and took his father's ſpear.—The mail rattled on his breaſt. The heroes roſe around. They looked, in ſilence, on each other, marking the eyes of Fingal.—They ſaw the battle in his face: the death of armies on his ſpear.—A thouſand ſhields, at once, are placed on their arms; and they drew a thouſand ſwords. The hall of Selma brightened around. The clang of arms aſcends.—The gray dogs howl in their place. No word is among the mighty chiefs.—Each marked the eyes of the King; and half aſſumed his ſpear.</p>
            <p>SONS of Morven, begun the king, this is no time to fill the ſhell. The battle darkens near us; and death hovers over the land. Some ghoſt, the friend of Fingal, has forewarned us of the foe.—The ſons of the ſtranger come from the darkly-rolling ſea. For, from the water, came the ſign of Morven's gloomy danger.—Let each<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>THE hero moved on before his hoſt, like a cloud before a ridge of green fire; when it pours on the ſky of night, and mariners forſee a ſtorm. On Cona's riſing heath they ſtood: the white-boſomed maids beheld them above like a grove; they foreſaw the death of their youths, and looked towards the ſea with fear.—The white wave deceived them for diſtant ſails, and the tear is on their cheek.</p>
            <p>THE ſun roſe on the ſea, and we beheld a diſtant fleet.—Like the miſt of ocean they came: and poured their youth upon the coaſt.—The chief was among them, like the ſtag in the midſt of the herd.—His ſhield is ſtudded with gold, and ſtately ſtrode the king of ſpears.—He moved towards Selma; his thouſands moved behind.</p>
            <p>GO, with thy ſong of peace, ſaid Fingal; go, Ullin, to the king of ſwords. Tell him that we are mighty in battle; and that the ghoſts of our foes are many.—But renowned are they who have feaſted in my halls! they ſhew the arms<note n="‡" place="bottom">It was a cuſtom among the ancient Scots, to exchange arms with their gueſts, and thoſe arms were preſerved long in the different families, as monuments of the friendſhip which ſubſiſted between their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors.</note> of my fathers in a foreign land: the ſons of the ſtrangers wonder, and bleſs the friends of Morven's race; for our names have been heard afar; the kings of the world ſhook in the midſt of their people.</p>
            <p>ULLIN went with his ſong. Fingal reſted on his ſpear: he ſaw the mighty foe in his armour: and he bleſt the ſtranger's ſon.</p>

HOW ſtately art thou, ſon of the ſea! ſaid the king of woody Morven. Thy ſword is a beam of might by thy ſide: thy ſpear is a fir that defies the ſtorm. The varied face of the moon is not broader than thy ſhield.—Ruddy is thy face of youth! ſoft the ringlets of thy hair!—But this tree may fall; and his memory be forgot!—The daughter of the ſtranger will be ſad, and look to the rolling ſea:—the children will ſay, <q rend="inline">"We ſee a ſhip; perhaps it is the king of Balclutha."</q> The tear ſtarts from their mother's eye. Her thoughts are of him that ſleeps in Morven.</p>
            <p>SUCH were the words of the king, when Ullin came to the mighty Carthon: he threw down the ſpear before him; and raiſed the ſong of peace.</p>
            <p>COME to the feaſt of Fingal, Carthon, from the rolling ſea! par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the feaſt of the king, or lift the ſpear of war. The ghoſts of our foes are many: but renowned are the friends of Morven!</p>
            <p>BEHOLD that field, O Carthon; many a green hill riſes there, with moſſy ſtones and ruſtling graſs: theſe are the tombs of Fingal's foes, the ſons of the rolling ſea.</p>
            <p>DOST thou ſpeak to the feeble in arms, ſaid Carthon, bard of the woody Morven? Is my face pale for fear, ſon of the peaceful ſong? Why, then, doſt thou think to darken my ſoul with the tales of thoſe who fell?—My arm has fought in the battle; my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown is known afar. Go to the feeble in arms, and bid them yield to Fingal.—Have not I ſeen the fallen Balclutha? And ſhall I feaſt with Comhal's ſon? Comhal! who threw his fire in the midſt of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's hall! I was young, and knew not the cauſe why the virgins wept. The columns of ſmoke pleaſed mine eye, when they roſe above my walls; I often looked back, with gladneſs, when my friends
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0509500400:164"/>
fled along the hill.—But when the years of my youth came on, I beheld the moſs of my fallen walls: my ſigh aroſe with the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and my tears deſcended with night.—Shall I not fight, I ſaid to my ſoul, againſt the children of my foes? And I will fight, O bard; I feel the ſtrength of my ſoul.</p>
            <p>HIS people gathered around the hero, and drew, at once, their ſhining ſwords. He ſtands, in the midſt, like a pillar of fire; the tear half-ſtarting from his eye; for he thought of the fallen Balclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha, and the crowded pride of his ſoul aroſe. Sidelong he looked up to the hill, where our heroes ſhone in arms; the ſpear trembled in his hand: and, bending foreward, he ſeemed to threaten the king.</p>
            <p>SHALL I, ſaid Fingal to his ſoul, meet, at once, the king? Shall I ſtop him, in the midſt of his courſe, before his fame ſhall ariſe? But the bard, hereafter, may ſay, when he ſees the tomb of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon; Fingal took his thouſands, along with him, to battle, before the noble Carthon fell.—No:—bard of the times to come! thou ſhalt not leſſen Fingal's fame. My heroes will fight the youth, and Fingal behold the battle. If he overcomes, I ruſh, in my ſtrength, like the roaring ſtream of Cona.</p>
            <p>WHO, of my heroes, will meet the ſon of the rolling ſea? Many are his warriors on the coaſt: and ſtrong is his aſhen ſpear!</p>

            <p>CLESSAMMOR! ſaid the king<note n="†" place="bottom">Fingal did not then know that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon was the ſon of Cleſsammor.</note> of Morven, where is the ſpear of thy ſtrength? Wilt thou behold Connal bound; thy friend, at the ſtream of Lora? Riſe, in the light of thy ſteel, thou friend of Comhal. Let the youth of Balclutha feel the ſtrength of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's race.</p>
            <p>HE roſe in the ſtrength of his ſteel, ſhaking his grizly locks. He fitted the ſhield to his ſide; and ruſhed, in the pride of valour.</p>
            <p>CARTHON ſtood, on that heathy rock, and ſaw the heroes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. He loved the terrible joy of his face: and his ſtrength, in the locks of age.—Shall I lift that ſpear, he ſaid, that never ſtrikes, but once, a foe? Or ſhall I, with the words of peace, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the warrior's life? Stately are his ſteps of age!—lovely the remnant of his years. Perhaps it is the love of Moina; the father of car-borne Carthon. Often have I heard, that he dwelt at the ecchoing ſtream of Lora.</p>
            <p>SUCH were his words, when Cleſsámmor came, and lifted high his ſpear. The youth received it on his ſhield, and ſpoke the words of peace.—Warrior of the aged locks! Is there no youth to lift the ſpear? Haſt thou no ſon, to raiſe the ſhield before his father, and to meet the arm of youth? Is the ſpouſe of thy love no more? or weeps ſhe over the tombs of thy ſons? Art thou of the kings of men? What will be the fame of my ſword if thou ſhalt fall?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0509500400:166"/>
IT will be great, thou ſon of pride! begun the tall Cleſsámmor. I have been renowned in battle; but I never told my name<note n="*" place="bottom">To tell one's name to an enemy was reckoned, in thoſe days of heroiſm, a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt evaſion of fighting him; for, if it was once known, that friendſhip ſubſiſted, of old, between the anceſtors of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants, the battle immediately ceaſed; and the ancient amity of their forefathers was renewed. <hi>A man who tells his name to his enemy,</hi> was of old an ignominious term for a coward.</note> to a ſoe. Yield to me, ſon of the wave, and then thou ſhalt know, that the mark of my ſword is in many a field.</p>
            <p>I NEVER yielded, king of ſpears! replied the noble pride of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon: I have alſo fought in battles; and I behold my future fame. Deſpiſe me not, thou chief of men; my arm, my ſpear is ſtrong. Retire among thy friends, and let young heroes fight.</p>
            <p>WHY doſt thou wound my ſoul, replied Cleſsámmor with a tear? Age does not tremble on my hand; I ſtill can lift the ſword. Shall I fly in Fingal's ſight; in the ſight of him I loved? Son of the ſea! I never fled: exalt thy pointed ſpear.</p>
            <p>THEY fought, like two contending winds, that ſtrive to roll the wave. Carthon bade his ſpear to err; for he ſtill thought that the foe was the ſpouſe of Moina.—He broke Cleſsámmor's beamy ſpear in twain: and ſeized his ſhining ſword. But as Carthon was binding the chief; the chief drew the dagger of his fathers. He ſaw the foe's uncovered ſide; and opened, there, a wound.</p>
            <p>FINGAL ſaw Cleſsámmor low: he moved in the ſound of his ſteel. The hoſt ſtood ſilent, in his preſence; they turned their eyes towards the hero.—He came, like the ſullen noiſe of a ſtorm, before the winds ariſe: the hunter hears it in the vale, and retires to the cave of the rock.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0509500400:167"/>
CARTHON ſtood in his place: the blood is ruſhing down his ſide: he ſaw the coming down of the king; and his hopes of fame aroſe<note n="*" place="bottom">This expreſſion admits of a double meaning, either that Carthon hoped to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire glory by killing Fingal; or to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered famous by falling by his hand. The laſt is the moſt probable, as Carthon is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready wounded.</note>; but pale was his cheek: his hair flew looſe, his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met ſhook on high: the force of Carthon failed; but his ſoul was ſtrong.</p>
            <p>FINGAL beheld the heroe's blood; he ſtopt the uplifted ſpear. Yield, king of ſwords! ſaid Comhal's ſon; I behold thy blood. Thou haſt been mighty in battle; and thy fame ſhall never fade.</p>
            <p>ART thou the king ſo far renowned, replied the car-borne Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon? Art thou that light of death, that frightens the kings of the world?—But why ſhould Carthon aſk? for he is like the ſtream of his deſart; ſtrong as a river, in his courſe: ſwift as the eagle of the ſky.—O that I had ſought with the king; that my ſame might be great in the ſong! that the hunter, beholding my tomb, might ſay, he fought with the mighty Fingal. But Carthon dies unknown; he has poured out his force on the feeble.</p>
            <p>BUT thou ſhalt not die unknown, replied the king of woody Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: my bards are many, O Carthon, and their ſongs deſcend to future times. The children of the years to come ſhall hear the fame of Carthon; when they ſit round the burning oak<note n="†" place="bottom">In the north of Scotland, till very lately, they burnt a large trunk of an oak at their feſtivals; it was called <hi>the trunk of the feaſt.</hi> Time had, ſo much, conſecrated the cuſtom, that the vulgar thought it a kind of ſacrilege to diſuſe it.</note>, and the night is ſpent in the ſongs of old. The hunter, ſitting in the heath, ſhall hear the ruſtling blaſt; and, raiſing his eyes, behold the rock where Carthon fell. He ſhall turn to his ſon, and ſhew the place

where the mighty fought; <q rend="inline">"There the king of Balclutha fought, like the ſtrength of a thouſand ſtreams."</q>
            </p>
            <p>JOY roſe in Carthon's face: he lifted his heavy eyes.—He gave his ſword to Fingal, to lie within his hall, that the memory of Balclutha's king might remain on Morven.—The battle ceaſed along the field, for the bard had ſung the ſong of peace. The chiefs ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered round the falling Carthon, and heard his words, with ſighs. Silent they leaned on their ſpears, while Balclutha's hero ſpoke. His hair ſighed in the wind, and his words were feeble.</p>
            <p>KING of Morven, Carthon ſaid, I fall in the midſt of my courſe. A foreign tomb receives, in youth, the laſt of Reuthámir's race. Darkneſs dwells in Balclutha: and the ſhadows of grief in Crathmo.—But raiſe my remembrance on the banks of Lora: where my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers dwelt. Perhaps the huſband of Moina will mourn over his fallen Carthon.</p>
            <p>HIS words reached the heart of Cleſsámmor: he fell, in ſilence, on his ſon. The hoſt ſtood darkened around: no voice is on the plains of Lora. Night came, and the moon, from the eaſt, looked on the mournful field: but ſtill they ſtood, like a ſilent grove that lifts its head on Gormal, when the loud winds are laid, and dark au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn is on the plain.</p>
            <p>THREE days they mourned above Carthon; on the fourth his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died. In the narrow plain of the rock they lie; and a dim ghoſt defends their tomb. There lovely Moina is often ſeen; when the ſun-beam darts on the rock, and all around is dark. There ſhe is ſeen, Malvina, but not like the daughters of the hill. Her robes are from the ſtranger's land; and ſhe is ſtill alone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0509500400:169"/>
FINGAL was ſad for Carthon; he deſired his bards to mark the day, when ſhadowy autumn returned. And often did they mark the day and ſing the hero's praiſe. Who comes ſo dark from ocean's roar, like autumn's ſhadowy cloud? Death is trembling in his hand! his eyes are flames of fire!—Who roars along dark Lora's heath? Who but Carthon, king of ſwords? The people fall! ſee! how he ſtrides, like the ſullen ghoſt of Morven!—But there he lies a goodly oak, which ſudden blaſts overturned! When ſhalt thou riſe, Balclutha's joy! lovely car-borne Carthon?—Who comes ſo dark from ocean's roar, like autumn's ſhadowy cloud?</p>
            <p>SUCH were the words of the bards, in the day of their mourning: I have accompanied their voice; and added to their ſong. My ſoul has been mournful for Carthon; he fell in the days of his valour: and thou, O Cleſsámmor! where is thy dwelling in the air?—Has the youth forgot his wound? And flies he, on the clouds, with thee?—I feel the ſun, O Malvina, leave me to my reſt. Perhaps they may come to my dreams; I think I hear a feeble voice.—The beam of heaven delights to ſhine on the grave of Carthon: I feel it warm around.</p>

            <head>THE DEATH of CUCHULLIN: A POEM<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Tradition throws conſiderable light on the hiſtory of Ireland, during the long reign of Fingal, the ſon of Comhal, in Morven.—Arth, the ſon of Cairbre, ſupreme king of Ireland, dying, was ſucceeded by his ſon Cormac, a minor.—The petty kings and chiefs of the tribes met at Temora, the royal palace, in order to chuſe, out of their own number, a guardian to the young king. Diſputes, concerning the choice of a proper perſon, run high, and it was reſolved to end all differences by giving the tuition of the young king to Cuchullin, the ſon of Semo, who had rendered himſelf famous by his great actions, and who reſided, at the time, with Connal, the ſon of Caithbat, in Ulſter.</p>
                  <p>Cuchullin was but three and twenty years old, when he aſſumed the management of affairs in Ireland: and the invaſion of Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran happened two years after. In the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeventh year of Cuchullin's age, and the third of his adminiſtration, Torlath, the ſon of Cantéla, ſet up for himſelf in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught, and advanced towards Temora, in order to dethrone Cormac. Cuchullin marched againſt him, came up with him at the Lake of Lego, and totally defeated his forces. Torlath fell in the battle by Cuchullin's hand; but as he himſelf preſſed too eagerly on the flying enemy, he was mortally wounded by an arrow, and died the ſecond day after.</p>
                  <p>The good fortune of Cormac fell with Cuchullin: many ſet up for themſelves, and anarchy and confuſion reigned. At laſt Cormac was taken off, nobody knew how; and Cairbar, one of the competitors for the throne, having defeated all his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, became ſole monarch of Ireland.—The family of Fingal, who were in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Cormac's family, were reſolved to deprive Cairbar of the throne he had uſurped; in particular, Oſcar the ſon of Offian had determined to revenge the death of Cathol, his friend, who had been aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinated by Cairbar.—The threats of Oſcar reached Cairbar's ears: he invited him in a friendly manner to a feaſt which he had prepared at the royal palace of Temora, reſolving to pick a quarrel, and have ſome pretext for killing him.</p>
                  <p>The quarrel happened; the followers of both fought, and Cairbar and Oſcar ſell by mutual wounds: in the mean time Fingal arrived from Scotland with an army, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the friends of Cairbar, and re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the family of Cormac in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the kingdom.—The preſent poem concerns the death of Cuchullin. It is, in the original, called <hi>Duan loch Leigo, i. e. The Poem of Lego's Lake,</hi> and is an epiſode introduced in a great poem, which celebrated the laſt expedition of Fingal into Ireland. The greateſt part of the poem is loſt, and nothing remains but ſome epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodes, which a few old people in the north of Scotland retain on memory.—Cuchul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin is the moſt famous Champion in the Iriſh traditions and poems; in them he is always called the <hi>redoubtable Cuchullin;</hi> and the fables concerning his ſtrength and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour are innumerable. Oſſian thought his expedition againſt the Fir-bolg, or Belgae of Britain, a ſubject fit for an epic poem; which was extant till of late, and was called <hi>Tora-na-tana,</hi> or a <hi>Diſpute about Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,</hi> as the war which was the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, was commenced by the Britiſh Belgae, who inhabited Ireland, in order to extend their territories.—The fragments that remain of this poem are animated with the genuine ſpirit of Oſſian; ſo that there can be do doubt that it was of his compoſition.</p>

            <p>IS the wind on Fingal's ſhield? Or is the voice of paſt times in my hall? Sing on, ſweet voice, for thou art pleaſant, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt away my night with joy. Sing on, O Bragela, daughter of Car-borne Songlan!</p>

IT is the white wave of the rock, and not Cuchullin's ſails. Often do the miſts deceive me for the ſhip of my love! when they riſe round ſome ghoſt, and ſpread their gray ſkirts on the wind. Why doſt thou delay thy coming, ſon of the generous Semo?—Four times has autumn returned with its winds, and raiſed the ſeas of Togorma<note n="*" place="bottom">Togorma, <hi>i. e. The iſland of blue waves,</hi> one of the Hebrides, was ſubject to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, the ſon of Caithbat, Cuchullin's friend.—He is ſometimes called the ſon of Colgar, from one of that name who was the founder of the family.—Connal, a few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the news of Torlath's revolt came to Temora, had ſailed to Togorma, his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive iſle; where he was detained by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winds during the war in which Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chullin was killed.</note>,

ſince thou haſt been in the roar of battles, and Bragéla diſtant far.—Hills of the iſle of miſt! when will ye anſwer to his hounds?—But ye are dark in your clouds, and ſad Bragéla calls in vain. Night comes rolling down: the face of ocean fails. The heath-cock's head is beneath his wing: the hind ſleeps with the hart of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart. They ſhall riſe with the morning's light, and feed on the moſſy ſtream. But my tears return with the ſun, my ſighs come on with the night. When wilt thou come in thine arms, O chief of moſſy Tura?</p>
            <p>PLEASANT is thy voice in Oſſian's ear, daughter of car-borne Sorglan! But retire to the hall of ſhells; to the beam of the burning oak.—Attend to the murmur of the ſea: it rolls at Dunſcaich's walls: let ſleep deſcend on thy blue eyes, and the hero come to thy dreams.</p>
            <p>CUCHULLIN ſits at Lego's lake, at the dark rolling of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Night is around the hero; and his thouſands ſpread on the heath: a hundred oaks burn in the midſt, the feaſt of ſhells is ſmok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wide.—Carril ſtrikes the harp, beneath a tree; his gray locks glitter in the beam; the ruſtling blaſt of night is near, and lifts his aged hair.—His ſong is of the blue Togorma, and of its chief, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chullin's friend.</p>
            <p>WHY art thou abſent, Connal, in the day of the gloomy ſtorm? The chiefs of the ſouth have convened againſt the car-borne Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac: the winds detain thy ſails, and thy blue waters roll around thee. But Cormac is not alone: the ſon of Semo fights his battles. Semo's ſon his battles fights! the terror of the ſtranger! he that is

            <p>SUCH was the ſong of Carril, when a ſon of the foe appeared; he threw down his pointleſs ſpear, and ſpoke the words of Torlath: Torlath the chief of heroes, from Lego's ſable ſurge: he that led his thouſands to battle, againſt car-borne Cormac. Cormac who was diſtant far, in Temora's<note n="†" place="bottom">The royal palace of the Iriſh kings; Teamhrath according to ſome of the bards.</note> ecchoing halls: he learned to bend the bow of his fathers; and to lift the ſpear. Nor long didſt thou lift the ſpear, mildly-ſhining beam of youth! death ſtands dim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thee, like the darkened half of the moon behind its growing light.</p>
            <p>CUCHULLIN roſe before the bard<note n="‡" place="bottom">The bards were the heralds of ancient times; and their perſons were ſacred on account of their office. In later times they abuſed that privilege; and as their perſons were inviolable, they ſatyriſed and lampooned ſo freely thoſe who were not liked by their patrons, that they became a public nuiſance. Screened under the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of heralds, they groſly abuſed the enemy when he would not accept the terms they offered.</note>, that came from generous Torlath; he offered him the ſhell of joy, and honoured the ſon of ſongs. Sweet voice of Lego! he ſaid, what are the words of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lath? Comes he to our feaſt or battle, the car-borne ſon of Cantéla<note n="‖" place="bottom">Cean-teola', <hi>head of a family.</hi>
               </note>?</p>
            <p>HE comes to thy battle, replied the bard, to the ſounding ſtrife of ſpears.—When morning is gray on Lego, Torlath will fight
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0509500400:175"/>
on the plain: and wilt thou meet him, in thine arms, king of the iſle of miſt? Terrible is the ſpear of Torlath! it is a meteor of night. He lifts it, and the people fall: death ſits in the lightning of his ſword.</p>
            <p>Do I fear, replied Cuchullin, the ſpear of car-borne Torlath? He is brave as a thouſand heroes; but my ſoul delights in war. The ſword reſts not by the ſide of Cuchullin, bard of the times of old! Morning ſhall meet me on the plain, and gleam on the blue arms of Semo's ſon.—But ſit thou, on the heath, O bard! and let us hear thy voice: partake of the joyful ſhell; and hear the ſongs of Temora.</p>
            <p>THIS is no time, replied the bard, to hear the ſong of joy; when the mighty are to meet in battle like the ſtrength of the waves of Lego. Why art thou ſo dark, Slimora<note n="*" place="bottom">Sila'-mor, <hi>great bill.</hi>
               </note>! with all thy ſilent woods? No green ſtar trembles on thy top; no moon-beam on thy ſide. But the meteors of death are there, and the gray watry forms of ghoſts. Why art thou dark, Slimora! with thy ſilent woods?</p>
            <p>HE retired, in the ſound of his ſong; Carril accompanied his voice. The muſic was like the memory of joys that are paſt, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and mournful to the ſoul. The ghoſts of departed bards heard it from Slimora's ſide. Soft ſounds ſpread along the wood, and the ſilent valleys of night rejoice.—So, when he ſits in the ſilence of noon, in the valley of his breeze, the humming of the mountain bee comes to Oſſian's ear: the gale drowns it often in its courſe; but the pleaſant ſound returns again.</p>
            <p>RAISE, ſaid Cuchullin, to his hundred bards, the ſong of the noble Fingal: that ſong which he hears at night, when the dreams
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0509500400:176"/>
of his reſt deſcend: when the bards ſtrike the diſtant harp, and the faint light gleams on Selma's walls. Or let the grief of Lara riſe, and the ſighs of the mother of Calmar<note n="*" place="bottom">Calmar the ſon of Matha. His death is related at large, in the third book of Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal. He was the only ſon of Matha; and the family was extinct in him.—The ſeat of the family was on the banks of the river Lara, in the neighbourhood of Lego, and probably near the place where Cuchullin lay; which circumſtance ſuggeſted to him, the lamentation of Alclétha over her ſon.</note>, when he was ſought, in vain, on his hills; and ſhe beheld his bow in the hall.—Carril, place the ſhield of Caithbat on that branch; and let the ſpear of Cuchullin be near; that the ſound of my battle may riſe with the gray beam of the eaſt.</p>
            <p>THE hero leaned on his father's ſhield: the ſong of Lara roſe. The hundred bards were diſtant far: Carril alone is near the chief. The words of the ſong were his; and the ſound of his harp was mournful.</p>

            <p>WHY doſt thou look towards the deſart, mother of car-borne Calmar?—</p>
            <p>SUCH was the ſong of Carril, when Cuchullin lay on his ſhield: the bards reſted on their harps, and ſleep fell ſoftly around.—The ſon of Semo was awake alone; his ſoul was fixed on the war.—The burning oaks began to decay; faint red light is ſpread around.—A feeble voice is heard: the ghoſt of Calmar came. He ſtalked in the beam. Dark is the wound in his ſide. His hair is diſordered and looſe. Joy ſits darkly on his face; and he ſeems to invite Cuchullin to his cave.</p>

SON of the cloudy night! ſaid the riſing chief of Erin; Why doſt thou bend thy dark eyes on me, ghoſt of the car-borne Calmar? Wouldeſt thou frighten me, O Matha's ſon! from the battles of Cormac? Thy hand was not feeble in war; neither was thy voice<note n="*" place="bottom">See Calmar's ſpeech, in the firſt book of Fingal.</note> for peace. How art thou changed, chief of Lara! if thou now doſt adviſe to fly!—But, Calmar, I never fled. I never feared<note n="†" place="bottom">See Cuchuilin's reply to Connal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Crugal's ghoſt. Fin. b. 2.</note> the ghoſts of the deſart. Small is their knowledge, and weak their hands; their dwelling is in the wind.—But my ſoul grows in danger, and rejoices in the noiſe of ſteel. Retire thou to thy cave; thou art not Calmar's ghoſt; he delighted in battle, and his arm was like the thunder of heaven.</p>
            <p>HE retired in his blaſt with joy, for he had heard the voice of his praiſe. The faint beam of the morning roſe, and the ſound of Caithbat's buckler ſpread. Green Ullin's warriors convened, like the roar of many ſtreams.—The horn of war is heard over Lego; the mighty Torlath came.</p>

            <head>DAR-THULA: A POEM<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>It may not be improper here, to give the ſtory which is the foundation of this poem, as it is handed down by tradition.—Uſnoth lord of Etha, which is probably that part of Argyleſhire which is near Loch Eta, an arm of the ſea in Lorn, had three ſons, Nathos, Althos, and Ardan by Slis-sáma, the daughter of Semo and ſiſter to the celebrated Cuchullin. The three brothers, when very young, were ſent over to Ireland, by their father, to learn the uſe of arms, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their uncle Cuchullin, who made a great figure in that kingdom. They were juſt landed in Ulſter when the news of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chullin's death arrived. Nathos, though very young, took the command of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chullin's army, made head againſt Cairbar the uſurper, and defeated him in ſeveral battles. Cairbar at laſt having found means to murder Cormac the lawful king, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Nathos ſhifted ſides, and he himſelf was obliged to return into Ulſter, in order to paſs over into Scotland.</p>
                  <p>Dar-thula, the daughter of Colla, with whom Cairbar was in love, reſided, at that time, in Selama a caſtle in Ulſter: ſhe ſaw, fell in love, and fled with Nathos; but a ſtorm riſing at ſea, they were unfortunately driven back on that part of the coaſt of Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, where Cairbar was encamped with his army. The three brothers, after having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themſelves, for ſome time, with great bravery, were overpowered and ſlain, and the unfortunate Dar-thula killed herſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the body of her beloved Nathos.</p>
                  <p>Oſſian opens the poem, on the night pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding the death of the ſons of Uſnoth, and brings in, by way of epiſode, what paſſed before. He relates the death of Dar-thula differently from the common tradition; his account is the moſt probable, as ſuicide ſeems to have been unknown in thoſe early times: for no traces of it are found in the old poetry.</p>

            <p>DAUGHTER of heaven<note n="†" place="bottom">The addreſs to the moon is very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in the original. It is in a lyric mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and appears to have been ſung to the harp.</note>, fair art thou! the ſilence of thy face is pleaſant. Thou comeſt forth in lovelineſs: the ſtars attend thy blue ſteps in the eaſt. The clouds rejoice in thy preſence, O moon, and brighten their dark-brown ſides. Who is like thee in

The ſtars are aſhamed in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and turn aſide their green, ſparkling eyes.—Whither doſt thou retire from thy courſe, when the darkneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">The poet means the moon in her wane.</note> of thy countenance grows? Haſt thou thy hall like Oſſian? Dwelleſt thou in the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of grief? Have thy ſiſters fallen from heaven? Are they who rejoiced with thee, at night, no more?—Yes!—they have fallen, fair light! and thou doſt often retire to mourn.—But thou thyſelf ſhalt fail, one night; and leave thy blue path in heaven. The ſtars will then lift their green heads: they who were aſhamed in thy preſence, will rejoice.</p>
            <p>THOU art now clothed with thy brightneſs: look from thy gates in the ſky. Burſt the cloud, O wind, that the daughter of night may look forth, that the ſhaggy mountains may brighten, and the ocean roll its blue waves, in light.</p>

               </note>, the firſt of Erin's maids? She has fled from the love of Cairbar, with the car-borne Nathos. But the winds deceive thee, O Dar-thula; and deny the woody Etha, to thy ſails. Theſe are not thy mountains, Nathos, nor is that the roar of thy climbing waves. The halls of Cairbar are near; and the towers of the foe lift their heads. Ullin ſtretches its green head into the ſea; and Tura's bay receives the ſhip. Where have ye been, ye ſouthern winds! when the ſons of my love were deceived? But ye have been ſporting on plains, and purſuing the thiſtle's beard. O that ye had been ruſtling in the ſails of Nathos, till the hills of Etha roſe! till they roſe in their clouds, and ſaw their coming chief! Long haſt thou been abſent, Nathos! and the day of thy return is paſt<note n="†" place="bottom">That is, the day appointed by deſtiny. We find no deity in Oſſian's poetry, if fate is not one; of that he is very full in ſome of his poems in the tranſlator's hands.</note>.</p>
            <p>BUT the land of ſtrangers ſaw thee, lovely: thou waſt lovely in the eyes of Dar-thula. Thy face was like the light of the morning, thy hair like the raven's wing. Thy ſoul was generous and mild, like the hour of the ſetting ſun. Thy words were the gale of the reeds, or the gliding ſtream of Lora.</p>
            <p>BUT when the rage of battle roſe, thou waſt like a ſea in a ſtorm; the clang of thy arms was terrible: the hoſt vaniſhed at the ſound of thy courſe.—It was then Dar-thula beheld thee, from the top of her moſſy tower: from the tower of Seláma<note n="‡" place="bottom">The poet does not mean that Seláma which is mentioned as the ſeat of Toſcar in Ulſter, in the poem of Conlath and Cu-thona. The word in the original ſignifies either <hi>beautiful to behold,</hi> or a place <hi>with a pleaſant or wide proſpect.</hi> In thoſe times, they built their houſes upon eminences, to command a view of the country, and to prevent their being ſurprized: many of them, on that account, were called Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lama.

LOVEly art thou, O ſtranger! ſhe ſaid, for her trembling ſoul aroſe. Fair art thou in thy battles, friend of the fallen Cormac<note n="*" place="bottom">Cormac the young king of Ireland, who was privately murdered by Cairbar.</note>! Why doſt thou ruſh on, in thy valour, youth of the ruddy look? Few are thy hands, in battle, againſt the car-borne Cairbar!—O that I might be freed of his love<note n="†" place="bottom">That is, of the love of Cairbar.</note>! that I might rejoice in the preſence of Nathos!—Bleſt are the rocks of Etha; they will behold his ſteps at the chace! they will ſee his white boſom, when the winds lift his raven hair!</p>
            <p>SUCH were thy words, Dar-thula, in Seláma's moſſy towers. But, now, the night is round thee: and the winds have deceived thy ſails. The winds have deceived thy ſails, Dar-thula: their bluſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſound is high. Ceaſe a little while, O north wind, and let me hear the voice of the lovely. Thy voice is lovely, Dar-thula, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ruſtling blaſts.</p>
            <p>ARE theſe the rocks of Nathos, and the roar of his mountain-ſtreams? Comes that beam of light from Uſnoth's nightly hall? The miſt rolls around, and the beam is feeble: but the light of Dar-thula's ſoul is the car-borne chief of Etha! Son of the generous Uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noth, why that broken ſigh? Are we not in the land of ſtrangers, chief of echoing Etha?</p>
            <p>THESE are not the rocks of Nathos, he replied, nor the roar of his ſtreams. No light comes from Etha's halls, for they are

diſtant ſar. We are in the land of ſtrangers, in the land of car-borne Cairbar. The winds have deceived us, Dar-thula. Ullin lifts here her green hills.—Go towards the north, Althos; be thy ſteps, Ardan, along the coaſt; that the foe may not come in darkneſs, and our hopes of Etha fail.—</p>
            <p>I WILL go towards that moſſy tower, and ſee who dwells about the beam.—Reſt, Dar-thula, on the ſhore! reſt in peace, thou beam of light! the ſword of Nathos is around thee, like the lightning of heaven.</p>
            <p>HE went. She ſat alone, and heard the rolling of the wave. The big tear is in her eye; and ſhe looked for the car-borne Nathos.—Her ſoul trembles at the blaſt. And ſhe turns her ear towards the tread of his feet.—The tread of his feet is not heard. Where art thou, ſon of my love! The roar of the blaſt is around me. Dark is the cloudy night.—But Nathos does not return. What detains thee, chief of Etha?—Have the foes met the hero in the ſtrife of the night?—</p>
            <p>HE returned, but his face was dark: he had ſeen his departed friend.—It was the wall of Tura, and the ghoſt of Cuchullin ſtalked there. The ſighing of his breaſt was frequent; and the decayed flame of his eyes terrible. His ſpear was a column of miſt: the ſtars looked dim through his form.

               </note>, but Nathos? My father reſts in the tomb. Silence dwells on Seláma: ſadneſs ſpreads on the blue ſtreams of my land. My friends have fallen, with Cormac. The mighty were ſlain in the battle of Ullin.</p>
            <p>EVENING darkened on the plain. The blue ſtreams failed before mine eyes. The unfrequent blaſt came ruſtling in the tops of Seláma's groves. My feat was beneath a tree on the walls of my fathers. Truthil paſt before my ſoul; the brother of my love; he that was abſent<note n="‡" place="bottom">The family of Colla preſerved their loyalty to Cormac long after the death of Cuchullin.</note> in battle againſt the car-borne Cairbar.</p>
            <p>BENDING on his ſpear, the gray-haired Colla came: his down-caſt face is dark, and ſorrow dwells in his ſoul. His ſword is on the ſide of the hero: the helmet of his fathers on his head.—The battle grows in his breaſt. He ſtrives to hide the tear.</p>
            <p>DAR-THULA, he ſighing ſaid, thou art the laſt of Colla's race. Truthil is fallen in battle. The king<note n="*" place="bottom">It is very common, in Oſſian's poetry, to give the title of King to every chief that was remarkable for his valour.</note> of Seláma is no more.—Cairbar comes, with his thouſands, towards Seláma's walls.—Colla will meet his pride, and revenge his ſon. But where ſhall I find thy ſafety, Dar-thula with the dark-brown hair! thou art lovely as the ſun-beam of heaven, and thy friends are low!</p>
            <p>

AND is the ſon of battle fallen, I ſaid with a burſting ſigh? Ceaſed the generous ſoul of Truthil to lighten through the field?—My ſafety, Colla, is in that bow; I have learned to pierce the deer. Is not Cairbar like the hart of the deſart, father of fallen Truthil?</p>
            <p>THE face of age brightened with joy: and the crouded tears of his eyes poured down. The lips of Colla trembled. His gray beard whiſtled in the blaſt. Thou art the ſiſter of Truthil, he ſaid, and thou burneſt in the fire of his ſoul. Take, Dar-thula, take that ſpear, that brazen ſhield, that burniſhed helmet: they are the ſpoils of a warrior: a ſon<note n="*" place="bottom">The poet, to make the ſtory of Dar-thula's arming herſelf for battle, more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, makes her armour to be that of a very young man, otherwiſe it would ſhock all belief, that ſhe, who was very young, ſhould be able to carry it.</note> of early youth.—When the light riſes on Seláma, we go to meet the car-borne Cairbar.—But keep thou near the arm of Colla; beneath the ſhadow of my ſhield. Thy father, Darthula, could once defend thee; but age is trembling on his hand.—The ſtrength of his arm has failed, and his ſoul is darkened with grief.</p>
            <p>We paſſed the night in ſorrow. The light of morning roſe. I ſhone in the arms of battle. The gray-haired hero moved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The ſons of Seláma convened around the ſounding ſhield of Colla. But few were they in the plain, and their locks were gray. The youths had fallen with Truthil, in the battle of car-borne Cormac.</p>
            <p>COMPANIONS of my youth! ſaid Colla, it was not thus you have ſeen me in arms. It was not thus I ſtrode to battle, when the great Confadan fell. But ye are laden with grief. The darkneſs
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0509500400:190"/>
of age comes like the miſt of the deſart. My ſhield is worn with years; my ſword is fixed<note n="*" place="bottom">It was the cuſtom of thoſe times, that every warrior at a certain age, or when he became unfit for the field, fixed his arms, in the great hall, where the tribe feaſted, upon joyful occaſions. He was afterwards never to appear in battle; and this ſtage of life was called the <hi>time of fixing of the arms.</hi>
               </note> in its place. I ſaid to my ſoul, thy evening ſhall be calm, and thy departure like a fading light. But the ſtorm has returned; I bend like an aged oak. My boughs are fallen on Seláma, and I tremble in my place.—Where art thou, with thy fallen heroes, O my car-borne Truthil! Thou anſwereſt not from thy ruſhing blaſt; and the ſoul of thy father is ſad. But I will be ſad no more, Cairbar or Colla muſt fall. I feel the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning ſtrength of my arm. My heart leaps at the ſound of battle.</p>
            <p>THE hero drew his ſword. The gleaming blades of his people roſe. They moved along the plain. Their gray hair ſtreamed in the wind.—Cairbar ſat, at the feaſt, in the ſilent plain of Lona<note n="†" place="bottom">Lona, <hi>a marſhy plain.</hi> It was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, in the days of Oſſian, to feaſt after a victory.

He ſaw the coming of the heroes, and he called his chiefs to battle.</p>
            <p>WHY<note n="‡" place="bottom">The poet, by an artifice, avoids the deſcription of the battle of Lona, as it would be improper in the mouth of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and could have nothing new, after the numerous deſcriptions, of that kind, in his other poems. He, at the ſame time, gives an opportunity to Dar thula to paſs a fine compliment on her lover.</note> ſhould I tell to Nathos, how the ſtrife of battle grew! I have ſeen thee, in the midſt of thouſands, like the beam of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's fire; it is beautiful, but terrible; the people fall in its red courſe.—The ſpear of Colla ſlew, for he remembered the battles of his youth. An arrow came with its ſound, and pierced the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's ſide. He fell on his ecchoing ſhield. My ſoul ſtarted with
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0509500400:191"/>
fear; I ſtretched my buckler over him; but my heaving breaſt was ſeen. Cairbar came, with his ſpear, and he beheld Seláma's maid: joy roſe on his dark-brown face; he ſtayed the lifted ſteel. He raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tomb of Colla; and brought me weeping to Seláma. He ſpoke the words of love, but my ſoul was ſad. I ſaw the ſhields of my fathers, and the ſword of car-borne Truthil. I ſaw the arms of the dead, and the tear was on my cheek.</p>
            <p>THEN thou didſt come, O Nathos: and gloomy Cairbar fled. He fled like the ghoſt of the deſart before the morning's beam. His hoſts were not near: and feeble was his arm againſt thy ſteel.</p>
            <p>WHY<note n="*" place="bottom">It is uſual with Oſſian, to repeat, at the end of the epiſodes, the ſentence which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced them.

            <p>I HAVE met, replied the hero, the battle in my youth.

My ſoul brightened in danger before I ſaw Seláma's fair; before I ſaw thee, like a ſtar, that ſhines on the hill, at night; the cloud ſlowly comes, and threatens the lovely light.</p>

            <p>AND they will prevail, O Nathos, ſaid the riſing ſoul of the maid: never ſhall Dar-thula behold the halls of gloomy Cairbar. Give me thoſe arms of braſs, that glitter to that paſſing meteor; I ſee them in the dark-boſomed ſhip. Dar-thula will enter the battle of ſteel.—Ghoſt of the noble Colla! do I behold thee on that cloud? Who is that dim beſide thee? It is the car-borne Truthil. Shall I behold the halls of him that ſlew Seláma's chief! No: I will not behold them, ſpirits of my love!</p>
            <p>JOY roſe in the face of Nathos, when he heard the white boſomed maid. Daughter of Seláma! thou ſhineſt on my ſoul. Come, with thy thouſands, Cairbar! the ſtrength of Nathos is returned. And thou, O aged Uſnoth, ſhalt not hear that thy ſon has fled. I remember thy words on Etha; when my ſails begun to riſe: when I ſpread them towards Ullin, towards the moſſy walls of Tura. Thou goeſt, he ſaid, O Nathos, to the king of ſhields; to Cuchullin chief of men who never fled from danger. Let not thine arm be feeble: neither be thy thoughts of flight; leſt the ſon of Semo ſay that Etha's race are weak. His words may come to Uſnoth, and ſadden his ſoul in the hall.—The tear is on his cheek. He gave this ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſword.</p>
            <p>I came to Tura's bay: but the halls of Tura were ſilent; I looked around, and there was none to tell of the chief of Dunſcaich. I

We found his riſing tomb. His conpanions in battle are there; his bards of many ſongs. Three days we mourned over the hero: on the fourth, I ſtruck the ſhield of Caithbat.

            <p>WE ſat, that night, in Selma round the ſtrength of the ſhell. The wind was abroad, in the oaks; the ſpirit of the mountain<note n="‡" place="bottom">By the ſpirit of the mountain is meant that deep and melancholy ſound which precedes a ſtorm; well known to thoſe who live in a high country.</note> ſhrieked. The blaſt came ruſtling through the hall, and gently touched my harp. The ſound was mournful and low, like the ſong of the tomb. Fingal heard it firſt, and the crouded ſighs of his boſom roſe.—Some of my heroes are low, ſaid the gray-haired king of Morven. I hear the ſound of death on the harp of my ſon. Oſſian, touch the ſounding ſtring; bid the ſorrow riſe; that their ſpirits may fly with joy to Morven's woody hills.</p>

            <p>SUCH was my ſong, in Selma, to the lightly-trembling harp. But Nathos was on Ullin's ſhore, ſurrounded by the night; he heard the voice of the foe amidſt the roar of tumbling waves. Silent he heard their voice, and reſted on his ſpear.</p>
            <p>MORNING roſe, with its beams; the ſons of Erin appear; like gray rocks, with all their trees, they ſpread along the coaſt. Cair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar ſtood, in the midſt, and grimly ſmiled when he ſaw the foe.</p>
            <p>NATHOS ruſhed forward, in his ſtrength; nor could Dar-thula ſtay behind. She came with the hero, lifting her ſhining ſpear. And who are theſe, in their armour, in the pride of youth? Who but the ſons of Uſnoth, Althos and dark-haired Ardan?</p>
            <p>COME, ſaid Nathos, come! chief of the high Temora! Let our battle be on the coaſt for the white-boſomed maid. His people are not with Nathos; they are behind that rolling ſea. Why doſt thou bring thy thouſands againſt the chief of Etha?

            <p>YOUTH of the heart of pride, ſhall Erin's king fight with thee? Thy fathers were not among the renowned, nor of the kings of men. Are the arms of ſoes in their halls? Or the ſhields of other times? Cairbar is renowned in Temora, nor does he fight with little men.</p>

THE tear ſtarts from car-borne Nathos; he turned his eyes to his brothers. Their ſpears flew, at once, and three heroes lay on earth. Then the light of their ſwords gleamed on high; the ranks of Erin yield; as a ridge of dark clouds before a blaſt of wind.</p>
            <p>THEN Cairbar ordered his people, and they drew a thouſand bows. A thouſand arrows flew; the ſons of Uſnoth fell. They fell like three young oaks which ſtood alone on the hill; the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller ſaw the lovely trees and wondered how they grew ſo lonely; the blaſt of the deſart came, by night, and laid their green heads low; next day he returned but they were withered, and the heath was bare.</p>
            <p>DAR-THULA ſtood in ſilent grief, and beheld their fall; no tear is in her eye: but her look is wildly ſad. Pale was her cheek; her trembling lips broke ſhort an half-formed word. Her dark hair flew on the wind.—But gloomy Cairbar came. Where is thy lover now? the car-borne chief of Etha? Haſt thou beheld the halls of Uſnoth? Or the dark-brown hills of Fingal? My battle had roared on Morven, did not the winds meet Dar-thula. Fingal himſelf would have been low and ſorrow dwelling in Selma.</p>
            <p>HER ſhield fell from Dar-thula's arm, her breaſt of ſnow appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It appeared, but it was ſtained with blood for an arrow was fixed in her ſide.

            <head>TEMORA: AN EPIC POEM<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Though the hiſtory which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the preſent poem, was given in the notes on the two pieces preceding, it may not be here improper to recapitulate ſome part of what has been ſaid.—Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the death of Cuchullin, Cair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar, lord of Atha, openly ſet up for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Connaught, and having privately murdered young king Cormac, became, without oppoſition, ſole monarch of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The murder of Cormac was ſo much reſented by Fingal, that he reſolved on an expedition into Ireland againſt Cair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar. Early intelligence of his deſigns came to Cairbar, and he had gathered the tribes together into Ulſter, to oppoſe Fingal's landing; at the ſame time his brother Cathmor kept himſelf with an army near Temora.—This Cathmor is one of the fineſt characters in the old poetry. His humanity, generoſity, and hoſpitality, were unparallelled: in ſhort, he had no fault, but too much attachment to ſo bad a brother as Cairbar.—The preſent poem has its name from Temora, the royal palace of the Iriſh kings, near which the laſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive battle was fought between Fingal and Cathmor. What has come to the tranſlator's hands, in a regular connection, is little more than the opening of the poem.—This work appears, from the ſtory of it, which is ſtill preſerv'd, to have been one of the greateſt of Oſſian's compoſitions. The variety of the characters makes it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting; and the war, as it is carried on by Fingal and Cathmor, affords inſtances of the greateſt bravery, mixed with incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably generous actions and ſentiments. One is at a loſs for which ſide to declare himſelf: and often wiſhes, when both commanders march to battle, that both may return victorious. At length the good fortune of Fingal preponderates, and the family of Cormac are re-eſtabliſhed on the Iriſh throne.</p>
                  <p>The Iriſh traditions relate the affair in another light, and exclaim againſt Fingal for appointing thirty judges, or rather ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, at Temora, for regulating the affairs of Ireland. They pretend to enumerate many acts of oppreſſion committed by thoſe judges; and affirm, that both they and a part of Fingal's army, which was left in Ireland to enforce their laws, were at laſt expelled the kingdom.—Thus the Iriſh tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, ſay the hiſtorians of that nation. It is ſaid, however, that thoſe gentlemen ſometimes create facts, in order afterwards to make remarks upon them; at leaſt, that they adopt for real facts, the traditions of their bards, when they throw luſtre on the ancient ſtate of their country.</p>
                  <p>The preſent poem opens in the morning. Cairbar is repreſented as retired from the reſt of the Iriſh chiefs, and tormented with remorſe for the murder of Cormac, when news was brought him of Fingal's landing. What paſſed, preceding that day, and is neceſſary to be known for carrying on the poem, is afterwards introduced by way of epiſode.</p>

            <p>THE blue waves of Ullin roll in light. The green hills are covered with day. Trees ſhake their duſky heads in the breeze; and gray torrents pour their noiſy ſtreams.—Two green hills, with their aged oaks, ſurround a narrow plain. The blue
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0509500400:201"/>
courſe of the mountain-ſtream is there; Cairbar ſtands on its banks.—His ſpear ſupports the king: the red eyes of his fear are ſad. Cormac riſes in his ſoul, with all his ghaſtly wounds. The gray form of the youth appears in the midſt of darkneſs, and the blood pours from his airy ſides.—Cairbar thrice threw his ſpear on earth; and thrice he ſtroked his beard. His ſteps are ſhort; he often ſtopt: and toſſed his ſinewy arms. He is like a cloud in the deſart; that varies its form to every blaſt: the valleys are ſad around, and fear, by turns, the ſhower.</p>
            <p>THE king, at length, reſumed his ſoul, and took his pointed ſpear. He turned his eyes towards Lena<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſcene deſcribed here is nearly that of the epic poem, Fingal. In this neighbourhood alſo the ſons of Uſnoth were killed.</note>.

Cairbar knew that the mighty were near, and called his gloomy chiefs. The ſounding ſteps of his heroes came. They drew, at once, their ſwords.

Wild is the look of Malthos from beneath two ſhaggy brows.—Foldath ſtands like an oozy rock, that covers its dark ſides with foam; his ſpear is like Slimora's fir, that meets the wind of heaven. His ſhield is marked with the ſtrokes of battle; and his red eye deſpiſes danger.

His ſhield is terrible, like the bloody moon, when it riſes in a ſtorm.—Then came Oſſian king of ſongs; and Morni's ſon, the firſt of men.

He ſees green Ullin with tears, and he remembers the tombs of his children. But far before the reſt, the ſon of Oſſian comes, bright in the ſmiles of youth, fair as the firſt beams of the ſun. His long hair falls on his back.—His dark brows are half hid beneath his helmet of ſteel. His ſword hangs looſe on the heroe's ſide. His ſpear glitters as he moves.

            <p>SONS of green Erin, begun the mild Hidalla, let not Fingal hear your words: leſt the foe rejoice, and his arm be ſtrong in the land.—Ye are brave, O warriors, and like the tempeſts of the deſart; they meet the rocks without fear, and overturn the woods in their courſe.—But let us move in our ſtrength, and ſlow as a gathered cloud, when the winds drive it from behind.—Then ſhall the mighty tremble, and the ſpear drop from the hand of the valiant.—We ſee the cloud of death, they will ſay; and their faces will turn pale. Fingal will mourn in his age; and ſay that his fame is ceaſed.—Morven will behold his chiefs no more: the moſs of years ſhall grow in Selma.</p>
            <p>CAIRBAR heard their words, in ſilence, like the cloud of a ſhower: it ſtands dark on Cromla, till the lightning burſts its ſide: the valley gleams with red light; the ſpirits of the ſtorm rejoice.—So ſtood the ſilent king of Temora; at length his words are heard.</p>
            <p>SPREAD the feaſt on Lena: and let my hundred bards attend. And thou, red-hair'd Olla, take the harp of the king. Go to Oſcar king of ſwords, and bid him to our feaſt. To-day we feaſt and

            <p>THE faces of the heroes brightened. They ſpread over Lena's heath. The feaſt of ſhells is prepared. The ſongs of the bards aroſe.</p>

Seven chiefs ſtood on thoſe paths, and called the ſtranger to the feaſt! But Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor dwelt in the wood to avoid the voice of praiſe.</p>
            <p>OLLA came with his ſongs. Oſcar went to Cairbar's feaſt. Three hundred heroes attended the chief, and the clang of their arms is terrible.

            <p>MY ſon lifted high the ſpear of Cormac: an hundred bards met him with ſongs. Cairbar concealed with ſmiles the death that was dark in his ſoul.

CAIRBAR roſe in his arms; darkneſs gathers on his brow. The hundred harps ceaſed at once. The clang<note n="*" place="bottom">When a chief was determined to kill a man that was in his power already, it was uſual to ſignify, that his death was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the ſound of a ſhield ſtruck with the blunt end of a ſpear; at the ſame time that a bard at diſtance raiſed the <hi>death-ſong.</hi> A ceremony of another kind was long uſed in Scotland upon ſuch occaſions.

Far diſtant on the heath Olla raiſed his ſong of woe. My ſon knew the ſign of death; and riſing ſeized his ſpear.</p>
            <p>OSCAR! ſaid the dark-red Cairbar, I behold the ſpear<note n="†" place="bottom">Cormac, the ſon of Arth, had given the ſpear, which is here the foundation of the quarrel, to Oſcar when he came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate him, upon Swaran's being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from Ireland.</note> of Erin's kings. The ſpear of Temora<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ti'-mór-ri', <hi>the houſe of the great king,</hi> the name of the royal palace of the ſupreme kings of Ireland.</note> glitters in thy hand, ſon of the woody Morven! It was the pride of an hundred kings, the death of heroes of old. Yield it, ſon of Oſſian, yield it to car-borne Cairbar.</p>
            <p>SHALL I yield, Oſcar replied, the gift of Erin's injured king: the gift of fair-haired Cormac, when Oſcar ſcattered his foes? I came to his halls of joy, when Swaran ſled from Fingal. Gladneſs roſe in the face of youth: he gave the ſpear of Temora. Nor did he give it to the feeble, O Cairbar, neither to the weak in ſoul. The darkneſs of thy face is not a ſtorm to me; nor are thine eyes the flames of death. Do I fear thy clanging ſhield? Does my ſoul tremble at Olla's ſong? No: Cairbar, frighten thou the feeble; Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car is like a rock.</p>
            <p>AND wilt thou not yield the ſpear, replied the riſing pride of Cairbar? Are thy words mighty becauſe Fingal is near, the gray-haired

warrior of Morven. He has fought with little men. But he muſt vaniſh before Cairbar, like a thin pillar of miſt before the winds of Atha<note n="*" place="bottom">Atha, <hi>ſhallow river:</hi> the name of Cair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar's ſeat in Connaught.</note>.</p>
            <p>WERE he who fought with little men near the chief of Atha: Atha's chief would yield green Erin to avoid his rage. Speak not of the mighty, O Cairbar! but turn thy ſword on me. Our ſtrength is equal: but Fingal is renowned! the firſt of mortal men!</p>
            <p>THEIR people ſaw the darkening chiefs. Their crowding ſteps are heard around. Their eyes roll in fire. A thouſand ſwords are half unſheathed. Red-haired Olla raiſed the ſong of battle: the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling joy of Oſcar's ſoul aroſe: the wonted joy of his ſoul when Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal's horn was heard.</p>
            <p>DARK as the ſwelling wave of ocean before the riſing winds, when it bends its head near the coaſt, came on the hoſt of Cairbar.—Daughter of Toſcar<note n="†" place="bottom">The poet means Malvina, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Toſcar, to whom he addreſſed that part of the poem, which related to the death of Oſcar her lover.</note>! why that tear? He is not fallen yet. Many were the deaths of his arm before my hero fell!—Behold they fall before my ſon like the groves in the deſart, when an angry ghoſt ruſhes through night, and takes their green heads in his hand! Morlath falls: Maronnan dies: Conachar trembles in his blood. Cairbar ſhrinks before Oſcar's ſword; and creeps in darkneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his ſtone. He lifted the ſpear in ſecret, and pierced my Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car's ſide. He falls forward on his ſhield: his knee ſuſtains the chief: but his ſpear is in his hand. See gloomy Cairbar<note n="‡" place="bottom">The Iriſh hiſtorians place the death of Cairbar, in the latter end of the third cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury: they ſay, he was killed in battle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Oſcar the ſon of Oſſian, but deny that he fell by his hand.

The ſteel pierced his forehead, and divided his red hair behind. He
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0509500400:209"/>
lay, like a ſhattered rock, which Cromla ſhakes from its ſide. But never more ſhall Oſcar riſe! he leans on his boſſy ſhield. His ſpear is in his terrible hand: Erin's ſons ſtood diſtant and dark. Their ſhouts aroſe, like the crowded noiſe of ſtreams, and Lena echoed around.</p>
            <p>FINGAL heard the ſound; and took his father's ſpear. His ſteps are before us on the heath. He ſpoke the words of woe. I hear the noiſe of battle: and Oſcar is alone. Riſe, ye ſons of Morven, and join the hero's ſword.</p>
            <p>OSSIAN ruſhed along the heath. Fillan bounded over Lena. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus flew with feet of wind. Fingal ſtrode in his ſtrength, and the light of his ſhield is terrible. The ſons of Erin ſaw it far diſtant; they trembled in their ſouls. They knew that the wrath of the king aroſe: and they foreſaw their death. We firſt arrived; we fought; and Erin's chiefs withſtood our rage. But when the king came, in the ſound of his courſe, what heart of ſteel could ſtand! Erin fled over Lena. Death purſued their flight.</p>
            <p>WE ſaw Oſcar leaning on his ſhield. We ſaw his blood around. Silence darkened on every hero's face. Each turned his back and wept. The king ſtrove to hide his tears. His gray beard whiſtled in the wind. He bends his head over his ſon: and his words are mixed with ſighs.</p>
            <p>AND art thou fallen, Oſcar, in the midſt of thy courſe? the heart of the aged beats over thee! He ſees thy coming battles. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0509500400:210"/>
the battles which ought to come, but they are cut off from thy fame. When ſhall joy dwell at Selma? When ſhall the ſong of grief ceaſe on Morven. My ſons fall by degrees: Fingal ſhall be the laſt of his race. The fame which I have received ſhall paſs away: my age will be without friends. I ſhall ſit like a gray cloud in my hall: nor ſhall I expect the return of a ſon, in the midſt of his ſounding arms. Weep, ye heroes of Morven! never more ſhall Oſcar riſe!</p>
            <p>AND they did weep, O Fingal; dear was the hero to their ſouls. He went out to battle, and the foes vaniſhed; he returned, in peace, amidſt their joy. No father mourned his ſon ſlain in youth; no brother his brother of love. They fell, without tears, for the chief of the people was low! Bran<note n="*" place="bottom">Bran was one of Fingal's dogs.—He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>was ſo remarkable for his fleetneſs, that the poet, in a piece which is not juſt now in the tranſlator's hands, has given him the ſame properties with Virgil's Camilla.</note> is howling at his feet: gloomy Luäth is ſad, for he had often led them to the chace; to the bounding roes of the deſart.</p>
            <p>WHEN Oſcar beheld his friends around, his white breaſt roſe with a ſigh.—The groans, he ſaid, of my aged heroes, the howling of my dogs, the ſudden burſts of the ſong of grief, have melted Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car's ſoul. My ſoul, that never melted before; it was like the ſteel of my ſword.—Oſſian, carry me to my hills! Raiſe the ſtones of my fame. Place the horn of the deer, and my ſword within my narrow dwelling.—The torrent hereafter may raiſe the earth of my tomb: the hunter may find the ſteel and ſay, <q rend="inline">"This has been Oſcar's ſword."</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0509500400:211"/>
AND falleſt thou, ſon of my fame! And ſhall I never ſee thee, Oſcar! When others hear of their ſons, I ſhall not hear of thee. The moſs is on the ſtones of his tomb, and the mournful wind is there. The battle ſhall be fought without him: he ſhall not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the dark-brown hinds. When the warrior returns from battles, and tells of other lands, he will ſay, I have ſeen a tomb, by the roaring ſtream, where a warrior darkly dwells: he was ſlain by car-borne Oſcar, the firſt of mortal men.—I, perhaps, ſhall hear him, and a beam of joy will riſe in my ſoul.</p>
            <p>THE night would have deſcended in ſorrow, and morning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in the ſhadow of grief: our chiefs would have ſtood like cold dropping rocks on Lena, and have forgot the war, did not the king diſperſe his grief, and raiſe his mighty voice. The chiefs, as new-wakened from dreams, lift their heads around.</p>
            <p>How long ſhall we weep on Lena; or pour our tears in Ullin? The mighty will not return. Oſcar ſhall not riſe in his ſtrength. The valiant muſt fall one day, and be no more known on his hills.—Where are our fathers, O warriors! the chiefs of the times of old? They have ſet like ſtars that have ſtone, we only hear the ſound of their praiſe. But they were renowned in their day, and the terror of other times. Thus ſhall we paſs, O warriors, in the day of our fall. Then let us be renowned when we may; and leave our fame behind us, like the laſt beams of the ſun, when he hides his red head in the weſt.</p>
            <p>ULLIN, my aged bard! take the ſhip of the king. Carry Oſcar to Selma, and let the daughters of Morven weep. We ſhall fight in Erin for the race of fallen Cormac. The days of my years begin to fail: I feel the weakneſs of my arm. My fathers bend from
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0509500400:212"/>
their clouds, to receive their gray-hair'd ſon. But, Trenmor! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I go hence, one beam of my fame ſhall riſe: ſo ſhall my days end, as my years begun, in fame: my life ſhall be one ſtream of light to other times.</p>
            <p>ULLIN rais'd his white ſails: the wind of the ſouth came forth. He bounded on the waves towards Selma's walls.—I remained in my grief, but my words were not heard.—The feaſt is ſpread on Lena: an hundred heroes reared the tomb of Cairbar: but no ſong is raiſed over the chief; for his ſoul had been dark and bloody. We remembered the fall of Cormac! and what could we ſay in Cair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar's praiſe?</p>
            <p>THE night came rolling down. The light of an hundred oaks aroſe. Fingal ſat beneath a tree. The chief of Etha ſat near the king, the gray-hair'd ſtrength of Uſnoth.</p>
            <p>OLD Althan<note n="*" place="bottom">Althan, the ſon of Conachar, was the chief bard of Arth king of Ireland. After the death of Arth, Althan attended his ſon Cormac, and was preſent at his death.—He had made his eſcape from Cairbar, by the means of Cathmor, and coming to Fingal, related, as here, the death of his maſter Cormac.</note> ſtood in the midſt, and told the tale of fallen Cormac. Althan the ſon of Conachar, the friend of car-borne Cuchullin: he dwelt with Cormac in windy Temora, when Semo's ſon fought with generous Torlath.—The tale of Althan was mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the tear was in his eye.</p>

The heroes ſaw Cuchullin<note n="†" place="bottom">That is, they ſaw a manifeſt likeneſs between the perſon of Nathos and Cuchullin.</note>, in the form of lovely Nathos.

on his heath.—Battles are fought at Lego: the ſword of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thos prevails. Soon ſhalt thou behold him in thy halls, king of woody Temora!—</p>
            <p>AND ſoon may I behold him, O Carril! replied the returning joy of Cormac. But my ſoul is ſad for Cuchullin; his voice was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in mine ear.—Often have we moved on Dora, at the chace of the dark-brown hinds: his bow was unerring on the mountains.—He ſpoke of mighty men. He told of the deeds of my fathers; and I felt the joy of my breaſt.—But ſit thou, at the feaſt, O Carril; I have often heard thy voice. Sing in the praiſe of Cuchullin; and of that mighty ſtranger.</p>
            <p>DAY roſe on Temora, with all the beams of the eaſt. Trathin came to the hall, the ſon of old Gellama<note n="‡" place="bottom">Geal-lamha, <hi>white-handed.</hi>
               </note>.—I behold, he ſaid, a dark cloud in the deſart, king of Innisfail! a cloud it ſeemed at firſt, but now a croud of men. One ſtrides before them in his ſtrength; and his red hair flies in the wind. His ſhield glitters to the beam of the eaſt. His ſpear is in his hand.</p>
            <p>CALL him to the feaſt of Temora, replied the king of Erin. My hall is the houſe of ſtrangers, ſon of the generous Gelláma!—Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it is the chief of Etha, coming in the ſound of his renown.—Hail, mighty ſtranger, art thou of the friends of Cormac?—But Carril, he is dark, and unlovely; and he draws his ſword. Is that the ſon of Uſnoth, bard of the times of old?</p>
            <p>IT is not the ſon of Uſnoth, ſaid Carril, but the chief of Atha.—Why comeſt thou in thy arms to Temora, Cairbar of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0509500400:216"/>
gloomy brow? Let not thy ſword riſe againſt Cormac! Whither doſt thou turn thy ſpeed?</p>
            <p>HE paſſed on in his darkneſs, and ſeized the hand of the king. Cormac foreſaw his death, and the rage of his eyes aroſe.—Retire, thou gloomy chief of Atha: Nathos comes with battle.—Thou art bold in Cormac's hall, for his arm is weak.—The ſword entered Cormac's ſide: he fell in the halls of his fathers. His fair hair is in the duſt. His blood is ſmoaking round.</p>
            <p>AND art thou fallen in thy halls, I ſaid<note n="‖" place="bottom">Althan ſpeaks.</note>, O ſon of noble Artho? The ſhield of Cuchullin was not near. Nor the ſpear of thy father. Mournful are the mountains of Erin, for the chief of the people is low!—Bleſt be thy ſoul, O Cormac! thou art ſnatched from the midſt of thy courſe.</p>
            <p>MY words came to the ears of Cairbar, and he cloſed us<note n="†" place="bottom">That is, himſelf and Carril, as it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards appears.</note> in the midſt of darkneſs. He feared to ſtretch his ſword to the bards<note n="*" place="bottom">The perſons of the bards were ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, that even he, who had juſt murdered his ſovereign, feared to kill them.</note>: though his ſoul was dark. Three days we pined alone: on the fourth, the noble Cathmor came.—He heard our voice from the cave; he turned the eye of his wrath on Cairbar.</p>
            <p>Chief of Atha! he ſaid, how long wilt thou pain my ſoul? Thy heart is like the rock of the deſart; and thy thoughts are dark.—But thou art the brother of Cathmor, and he will fight thy battles.—But Cathmor's ſoul is not like thine, thou feeble hand of war! The light of my boſom is ſtained with thy deeds: the bards will not ſing of my renown. They may ſay, <q rend="inline">"Cathmor was brave,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0509500400:217"/>
but he fought for gloomy Cairbar."</q> They will paſs over my tomb in ſilence, and my fame ſhall not be heard.—Cairbar! looſe the bards: they are the ſons of other times. Their voice ſhall be heard in other ages, when the kings of Temora have failed.—</p>
            <p>WE came forth at the words of the chief. We ſaw him in his ſtrength. He was like thy youth, O Fingal, when thou firſt didſt liſt the ſpear.—His face was like the plain of the ſun when it is bright: no darkneſs travelled over his brow. But he came with his thouſands to Ullin; to aid the red-haired Cairbar: and now he comes to revenge his death, O king of woody Morven.—</p>
            <p>AND let him come, replied the king; I love a foe like Cathmor. His ſoul is great; his arm is ſtrong, and his battles are full of fame.—But the little ſoul is like a vapour that hovers round the marſhy lake: it never riſes on the green hill, leſt the winds meet it there: its dwelling is in the cave, and it ſends forth the dart of death.</p>
            <p>USNOTH! thou haſt heard the fame of Etha's car-borne chiefs.—Our young heroes, O warrior, are like the renown of our fathers.—They fight in youth, and they fall: their names are in the ſong.—But we are old, O Uſnoth, let us not fall like aged oaks; which the blaſt overturns in ſecret. The hunter came paſt, and ſaw them lying gray acroſs a ſtream. How have theſe fallen, he ſaid, and whiſtling paſſed along.</p>
            <p>RAISE the ſong of joy, ye bards of Morven, that our ſouls may forget the paſt.—The red ſtars look on us from the clouds, and ſilently deſcend. Soon ſhall the gray beam of the morning riſe, and ſhew us the foes of Cormac.—Fillan! take the ſpear of the

king; go to Mora's dark-brown ſide. Let thine eyes travel over the heath, like flames of fire. Obſerve the foes of Fingal, and the courſe of generous Cathmor. I hear a diſtant ſound, like the falling of rocks in the deſart.—But ſtrike thou thy ſhield, at times, that they may not come through night, and the ſame of Morven ceaſe.—I begin to be alone, my ſon, and I dread the fall of my renown.</p>
            <p>THE voice of the bards aroſe. The king leaned on the ſhield of Trenmor.—Sleep deſcended on his eyes, and his future battles roſe in his dreams. The hoſt are ſleeping around. Dark-haired Fillan obſerved the foe. His ſteps are on a diſtant hill: we hear, at times, his clanging ſhield.</p>

               <p>One of the Fragments of Ancient Poetry lately publiſhed, gives a different account of the death of Oſcar, the ſon of Oſſian. The tranſlator, though he well knew the more probable tradition concerning that hero, was unwilling to reject a poem, which, if not really of Oſſian's compoſition, has much of his manner, and conciſe turn of expreſſion. A more correct copy of that fragment, which has ſince come to the tranſlator's hands, has enabled him to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the miſtake, into which a ſimilarity of names had led thoſe who handed down the poem by tradition.—The heroes of the piece are Oſcar the ſon of Caruth, and Dermid the ſon of Diaran. Oſſian, or perhaps his imitator, opens the poem with a lamentation for Oſcar, and afterwards, by an eaſy tranſition, relates the ſtory of Oſcar the ſon of Caruth, who ſeems to have bore the ſame character, as well as name, with Oſcar the ſon of Oſſian. Though the tranſlator thinks he has good reaſon to reject the fragment as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Oſſian; yet as it is, after all, ſtill ſomewhat doubtful whether it is or not, he has here ſubjoined it.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>WHY openeſt thou afreſh the ſpring of my grief, O ſon of Alpin, inquiring how Oſcar fell? My eyes are blind with tears; but memory beams on my heart. How can I relate the mournful death of the head of the people! Chief of the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, Oſcar, my ſon, ſhall I ſee thee no more!</p>
                  <p>He fell as the moon in a ſtorm; as the ſun from the midſt of his courſe, when clouds riſe from the waſte of the waves, when the blackneſs of the ſtorm inwraps the rocks of Ardannider. I, like an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
oak on Morven, I moulder alone in my place. The blaſt hath lopped my branches away; and I tremble at the wings of the north. Chief of the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, Oſcar, my ſon! ſhall I ſee thee no more!</p>
                  <p>But, ſon of Alpin, the hero fell not harmleſs as the graſs of the field; the blood of the mighty was on his ſword, and he travelled with death through the ranks of their pride. But Oſcar, thou ſon of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruth, thou haſt fallen low! No enemy fell by thy hand. Thy ſpear was ſtained with the blood of thy friend.</p>
                  <p>Dermid and Oſcar were one: They reaped the battle together. Their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was ſtrong as their ſteel; and death walked between them to the field. They came on the foe like two rocks falling from the brows of Ardven. Their ſwords were ſtained with the blood of the valiant: warriors fainted at their names. Who was equal to Oſcar, but Dermid? and who to Dermid, but Oſcar!</p>
                  <p>They killed mighty Dargo in the field; Dargo who never ſled in war. His daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was fair as the morn; mild as the beam of night. Her eyes, like two ſtars in a ſhower: her breath, the gale of ſpring: her breaſts, as the new-fallen ſnow floating on the moving heath. The warriors ſaw her, and loved; their ſouls were fixed on the maid. Each loved her as his fame; each muſt poſſeſs her or die. But her ſoul was fixed on Oſcar; the ſon of Caruth was the youth of her love. She forgot the blood of her father; and loved the hand that ſlew him.</p>
                  <p>Son of Caruth, ſaid Dermid, I love; O Oſcar, I love this maid. But her ſoul cleaveth unto thee; and nothing can heal Dermid. Here, pierce this boſom, Oſcar; relieve me, my friend, with thy ſword.</p>
                  <p>My ſword, ſon of Diaran, ſhall never be ſtained with the blood of Dermid.</p>
                  <p>Who then is worthy to ſlay me, O Oſcar ſon of Caruth? Let not my life paſs away unknown. Let none but Oſcar ſlay me. Send me with honour to the grave, and let my death be renowned.</p>
                  <p>Dermid, make uſe of thy ſword; ſon of Diaran, wield thy ſteel. Would that I fell with thee! that my death came from the hand of Dermid!</p>
                  <p>They fought by the brook of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by the ſtreams of Branno. Blood tinged the running water, and curdled round the moſſy ſtones. The ſtately Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid fell; he fell, and ſmiled in death.</p>
                  <p>And falleſt thou, ſon of Diaran, falleſt thou by Oſcar's hand! Dermid who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yielded in war, thus do I ſee thee fall!—He went, and returned to the maid of his love; he returned, but ſhe perceived his grief.</p>
                  <p>Why that gloom, ſon of Caruth? what ſhades thy mighty ſoul?</p>
                  <p>Though once renowned for the bow, O maid, I have loſt my ſame. Fixed on a tree by the brook of the hill, is the ſhield of the valiant Gormur, whom I ſlew in battle. I have waſted the day in vain, nor could my arrow pierce it.</p>
                  <p>Let me try, ſon of Caruth, the ſkill of Dargo's daughter. My hands were taught the bow: my father delighted in my ſkill.</p>
                  <p>She went. He ſtood behind the ſhield. Her arrow flew, and pierced his breaſt.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed be that hand of ſnow; and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that bow of yew! Who but the daughter of Dargo was worthy to ſlay the ſon of Caruth? Lay me in the earth, my fair one; lay me by the ſide of Dermid.</p>
                  <p>Oſcar! the maid replied, I have the ſoul of the mighty Dargo. Well pleaſed I can meet death. My ſorrow I can end.—She pierced her white boſom with the ſteel. She fell; ſhe trembled; and died.</p>
                  <p>By the brook of the hill their graves are laid; a birch's unequal ſhade covers their tomb. Often on their green earthen tombs the branchy ſons of the mountain feed, when mid-day is all in flames, and ſilence over all the hills.</p>

            <head>CARRIC-THURA: A POEM<note n="*" place="bottom">Fingal, returning from an expedition which he had made into the Roman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, reſolved to viſit Cathulla king of Inis-tore, and brother to Comála, whoſe ſtory is related, at large, in the dramatic poem, publiſhed in this collection. Upon his coming in ſight of Carric-thura, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of Cathulla, he obſerved a flame on its top, which, in thoſe days, was a ſignal of diſtreſs. The wind drove him into a bay, at ſome diſtance from Carric-thura, and he was obliged to paſs the night on the ſhore. Next day he attacked the army of Frothal king of Sora who had beſieged Cathulla in his palace of Carric-thura, and took Frothal himſelf priſoner, after he had engaged him in a ſingle combat. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of Carric-thura is the ſubject of the poem, but ſeveral other epiſodes are interwoven with it. It appears from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that this poem was addreſſed to a Culdee, or one of the firſt Chriſtian miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, and that the ſtory of the <hi>Spirit of Loda,</hi> ſuppoſed to be the ancient Odin of Scandinavia, was introduced by Oſſian in oppoſition to the Culdee's doctrine. Be this as it will, it lets us into Oſſian's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a ſuperior being; and ſhews that he was not addicted to the ſuperſtition which prevailed all the world over, before the introduction of Chriſtianity.</note>.</head>
            <p>HAST<note n="†" place="bottom">The ſong of Ullin, with which the poem opens, is in a lyric meaſure. It was uſual with Fingal, when he returned from his expeditions, to ſend his bards ſinging before him. This ſpecies of triumph is called, by Oſſian, the <hi>ſong of victory.</hi>

            <p>SUCH was the ſong of Ullin, when Fingal returned from battle: when he returned in the fair bluſhing of youth; with all his heavy locks. His blue arms were on the hero; like a gray cloud on the ſun, when he moves in his robes of miſt, and ſhews but half his beams. His heroes follow the king: the feaſt of ſhells is ſpread. Fingal turns to his bards, and bids the ſong to riſe.</p>
            <p>VOICES of ecchoing Cona! he ſaid, O bards of other times! Ye, on whoſe ſouls the blue hoſts of our fathers riſe! ſtrike the harp in my hall; and let Fingal hear the ſong. Pleaſant is the joy of grief! it is like the ſhower of ſpring, when it ſoftens the branch of the oak, and the young leaf lifts its green head. Sing on, O bards, to-morrow we lift the ſail. My blue courſe is through the ocean, to Carric-thura's walls; the moſſy walls of Sarno, where Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mála dwelt. There the noble Cathulla, ſpreads the feaſt of ſhells.

            <p>I SIT by the moſſy fountain; on the top of the hill of winds. One tree is ruſtling above me. Dark waves roll over the heath. The lake is troubled below. The deer deſcend from the hill.

            <p>SUCH was the ſong of Cronnan, on the night of Selma's joy. But morning roſe in the eaſt; the blue waters rolled in light.

But the ſign of diſtreſs was on their top: the green flame edged with ſmoke. The king of Morven ſtruck his breaſt: he aſſumed, at once, his ſpear. His darkened brow bends forward to the coaſt: he looks back to the lagging winds. His hair is diſordered on his back. The ſilence of the king is terrible.</p>
            <p>NIGHT came down on the ſea; Rotha's bay received the ſhip. A rock bends along the coaſt with all its ecchoing wood. On the top is the circle<note n="*" place="bottom">

A nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row plain ſpreads beneath, covered with graſs and aged trees, which the midnight winds, in their wrath, had torn from the ſhaggy rock. The blue courſe of a ſtream is there; and the lonely blaſt of ocean purſues the thiſtle's beard.</p>
            <p>THE flame of three oaks aroſe: the feaſt is ſpread around: but the ſoul of the king is ſad, for Carric-thura's battling chief. The

wan, cold moon roſe, in the eaſt. Sleep deſcended on the youths! Their blue helmets glitter to the beam; the fading fire decays. But ſleep did not reſt on the king: he roſe in the midſt of his arms, and ſlowly aſcended the hill to behold the flame of Sarno's tower.</p>
            <p>THE flame was dim and diſtant; the moon hid her red face in the eaſt. A blaſt came from the mountain, and bore, on its wings, the ſpirit of Loda. He came to his place in his terrors<note n="*" place="bottom">He is deſcribed, in a ſimile, in the poem concerning the death of Cuchullin.</note>, and he ſhook his duſky ſpear.—His eyes appear like flames in his dark face; and his voice is like diſtant thunder. Fingal advanced with the ſpear of his ſtrength, and raiſed his voice on high.</p>
            <p>SON of night, retire: call thy winds and fly! Why doſt thou come to my preſence, with thy ſhadowy arms? Do I fear thy gloomy form, diſmal ſpirit of Loda? Weak is thy ſhield of clouds: feeble is that meteor, thy ſword. The blaſt rolls them together; and thou thyſelf doſt vaniſh. Fly from my preſence ſon of night! call thy winds and fly!</p>
            <p>DOST thou force me from my place, replied the hollow voice? The people bend before me. I turn the battle in the field of the valiant. I look on the nations and they vaniſh: my noſtrils pour the blaſt of death. I come<note n="†" place="bottom">There is a great reſemblance between the terrors of this mock divinity, and thoſe of the true God, as they are deſcribed in the 18th Pſalm.</note> abroad on the winds: the tempeſts are before my face. But my dwelling is calm, above the clouds, the fields of my reſt are pleaſant.</p>
            <p>DWELL then in thy calm fields, ſaid Fingal, and let Comhal's ſon be forgot. Do my ſteps aſcend, from my hills, into thy peaceful plains? Do I meet thee, with a ſpear, on thy cloud, ſpirit of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal

Loda? Why then doſt thou frown on Fingal? or ſhake thine airy ſpear? But thou frowneſt in vain: I never fled from mighty men. And ſhall the ſons of the wind frighten the king of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? No: he knows the weakneſs of their arms.</p>
            <p>FLY to thy land, replied the form: receive the wind and fly. The blaſts are in the hollow of my hand: the courſe of the ſtorm is mine. The king of Sora is my ſon, he bends at the ſtone of my power. His battle is around Carric-thura; and he will prevail. Fly to thy land, ſon of Comhal, or feel my flaming wrath.</p>
            <p>HE lifted high his ſhadowy ſpear; and bent forward his terrible height. But the king, advancing, drew his ſword; the blade of dark-brown Luno<note n="*" place="bottom">The famous ſword of Fingal, made by Lun, or Luno, a ſmith of Lochlin.</note>. The gleaming path of the ſteel winds thro' the gloomy ghoſt. The form fell ſhapeleſs into air, like a column of ſmoke, which the ſtaff of the boy diſturbs, as it riſes from the half-extinguiſhed furnace.</p>
            <p>THE ſpirit of Loda ſhrieked, as, rolled into himſelf, he roſe on the wind. Iniſtore ſhook at the ſound. The waves heard it on the deep: they ſtopped, in their courſe, with fear: the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Fingal ſtarted, at once; and took their heavy ſpears. They miſſed the king: they roſe with rage; all their arms reſound.</p>
            <p>THE moon came forth in the eaſt. The king returned in the gleam of his arms. The joy of his youths was great, their ſouls ſettled, as a ſea from a ſtorm. Ullin raiſed the ſong of gladneſs. The hills of Iniſtore rejoiced. The flame of the oak aroſe; and the tales of heroes are told.</p>

BUT Frothal, Sora's battling king, ſits in ſadneſs beneath a tree. The hoſt ſpreads around Carric-thura. He looks towards the walls with rage. He longs for the blood of Cathulla, who, once, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the king in war.—When Annir reigned<note n="*" place="bottom">Annir was alſo the father of Erragon, who was king after the death of his brother Frothal.

Three days he feaſted in Sarno's halls, and ſaw the ſlow rolling eyes of Comála. He loved her, in the rage of youth, and ruſhed to ſeize the white-armed maid. Cathulla met the chief. The gloomy battle roſe. Frothal is bound in the hall: three days he pined alone. On the fourth, Sarno ſent him to his ſhip, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his land. But wrath darkened in his ſoul againſt the noble Cathulla. When Annir's ſtone<note n="†" place="bottom">That is, after the death of Annir.

The battle burned round Carric-thura, and Sarno's moſſy walls.</p>
            <p>MORNING roſe on Iniſtore. Frothal ſtruck his dark-brown ſhield. His chiefs ſtarted at the ſound; they ſtood, but their eyes were turned to the ſea. They ſaw Fingal coming in his ſtrength; and firſt the noble Thubar ſpoke.</p>
            <p>WHO comes like the ſtag of the mountain, with all his herd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him? Frothal, it is a foe; I ſee his forward ſpear. Perhaps it is the king of Morven, Fingal the firſt of men. His actions are well known on Gormal; the blood of his foes is in Starno's halls. Shall I aſk the peace<note n="‡" place="bottom">Honourable terms of peace.</note> of kings? He is like the thunder of heaven.</p>

SON of the feeble hand, ſaid Frothal, ſhall my days begin in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Shall I yield before I have conquered in battle, chief of ſtreamy Tora? The people would ſay in Sora, Frothal flew forth like a meteor; but the dark cloud met it, and it is no more. No: Thubar, I will never yield; my fame ſhall ſurround me like light. No: I will never yield, king of ſtreamy Tora.</p>
            <p>HE went forth with the ſtream of his people, but they met a rock: Fingal ſtood unmoved, broken they rolled back from his ſide. Nor did they roll in ſafety; the ſpear of the king purſued their flight. The field is covered with heroes. A riſing hill preſerved the flying hoſt.</p>
            <p>FROTHAL ſaw their flight. The rage of his boſom roſe. He bent his eyes to the ground, and called the noble Thubar.—Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar! my people fled. My fame has ceaſed to riſe. I will fight the king; I feel my burning ſoul. Send a bard to demand the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. Speak not againſt Frothal's words.—But, Thubar! I love a maid; ſhe dwells by Thano's ſtream, the white-boſomed daughter of Herman, Utha with the ſoftly-rolling eyes. She feared the daughter<note n="*" place="bottom">By the daughter of Iniſtore, Frothal means Comala, of whoſe death Utha pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably had not heard; conſequently ſhe feared that the former paſſion of Frothal for Comala might return.</note> of Iniſtore, and her ſoft ſighs roſe, at my departure. Tell to Utha that I am low; but that my ſoul delighted in her.</p>
            <p>SUCH were his words, reſolved to fight. But the ſoft ſigh of Utha was near. She had followed her hero over the ſea, in the armour of a man. She rolled her eye on the youth, in ſecret, from beneath a glittering helmet. But now ſhe ſaw the bard as he went, and the ſpear fell thrice from her hand. Her looſe hair flew on the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0509500400:231"/>
wind. Her white breaſt roſe, with ſighs. She lifted up her eyes to the king; ſhe would ſpeak, but thrice ſhe failed.</p>
            <p>FINGAL heard the words of the bard; he came in the ſtrength of ſteel. They mixed their deathful ſpears, and raiſed the gleam of their ſwords. But the ſteel of Fingal deſcended and cut Frothal's ſhield in twain. His fair ſide is expoſed; half bent he foreſees his death.</p>
            <p>DARKNESS gathered on Utha's ſoul. The tear rolled down her cheek. She ruſhed to cover the chief with her ſhield; but a fallen oak met her ſteps. She fell on her arm of ſnow; her ſhield, her helmet flew wide. Her white boſom heaved to the ſight; her dark-brown hair is ſpread on earth.</p>
            <p>FINGAL pitied the white-armed maid: he ſtayed the uplifted ſword. The tear was in the eye of the king, as, bending forward, he ſpoke. King of ſtreamy Sora! fear not the ſword of Fingal. It was never ſtained with the blood of the vanquiſhed; it never pierced a fallen foe. Let thy people rejoice along the blue waters of Tora: let the maids of thy love be glad. Why ſhouldeſt thou fall in thy youth, king of ſtreamy Sora?</p>
            <p>FROTHAL heard the words of Fingal, and ſaw the riſing maid: they<note n="*" place="bottom">Frothal and Utha.</note> ſtood in ſilence, in their beauty: like two young trees of the plain, when the ſhower of ſpring is on their leaves, and the loud winds are laid.</p>
            <p>DAUGHTER of Herman, ſaid Frothal, didſt thou come from Tora's ſtreams; didſt thou come, in thy beauty, to behold thy war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior

low? But he was low before the mighty, maid of the ſlow-roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eye! The feeble did not overcome the ſon of car-borne Annir. Terrible art thou, O king of Morven! in battles of the ſpear. But, in peace, thou art like the ſun, when he looks thro' a ſilent ſhower: the flowers lift their fair heads before him; and the gales ſhake their ruſtling wings. O that thou wert in Sora! that my feaſt were ſpread!—The future kings of Sora would ſee thy arms and rejoice. They would rejoice at the fame of their fathers, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the mighty Fingal.</p>
            <p>SON of Annir, replied the king, the fame of Sora's race ſhall be heard.—When chiefs are ſtrong in battle, then does the ſong ariſe! But if their ſwords are ſtretched over the feeble: if the blood of the weak has ſtained their arms; the bard ſhall forget them in the ſong, and their tombs ſhall not be known. The ſtranger ſhall come and build there, and remove the heaped-up earth. An half-worn ſword ſhall riſe before him; and bending above it, he will ſay, <q rend="inline">"Theſe are the arms of chiefs of old, but their names are not in the ſong."</q>—Come thou, O Frothal, to the feaſt of Iniſtore; let the maid of thy love be there; and our faces will brighten with joy.</p>
            <p>FINGAL took his ſpear, moving in the ſteps of his might. The gates of Carric-thura are opened. The feaſt of ſhells is ſpread.—The voice of muſic aroſe. Gladneſs brightened in the hall.—The voice of Ullin was heard; the harp of Selma was ſtrung.—Utha rejoiced in his preſence, and demanded the ſong of grief; the big tear hung in her eye, when the ſoft<note n="*" place="bottom">There is a propriety in introducing this epiſode, as the ſituations of Crimora and Utha were ſo ſimilar.</note> Crimora ſpoke.

               <p>IT is night;—I am alone, forlorn on the hill of ſtorms. The wind is heard in the mountain. The torrent ſhrieks down the rock. No hut receives me from the rain; forlorn on the hill of winds.</p>

RISE, moon! from behind thy clouds; ſtars of the night appear! Lead me, ſome light, to the place where my love reſts from the toil of the chace! his bow near him, unſtrung; his dogs panting around him. But here I muſt ſit alone, by the rock of the moſſy ſtream. The ſtream and the wind roar; nor can I hear the voice of my love.</p>
               <p>WHY delays my Salgar, why the ſon of the hill, his promiſe? Here is the rock, and the tree; and here the roaring ſtream. Thou didſt promiſe with night to be here. Ah! whither is my Salgar gone? With thee I would fly, my father; with thee, my brother of pride. Our race have long been ſoes*; but we are not foes, O Salgar!</p>
               <p>CEASE a little while, O wind! ſtream, be thou ſilent a while! let my voice be heard over the heath; let my wanderer hear me. Salgar! it is I who call. Here is the tree, and the rock. Salgar, my love! I am here. Why delayeſt thou thy coming?</p>
               <p>Lo! the moon appeareth. The flood is bright in the vale. The rocks are grey on the face of the hill. But I ſee him not on the brow; his dogs before him tell not that he is coming. Here I muſt ſit alone.</p>
               <p>BUT who are theſe that lie beyond me on the heath? Are they my love and my brother?—Speak to me, O my friends! they anſwer not. My ſoul is tormented with fears.—Ah! they are dead. Their ſwords are red from the fight. O my brother! my brother! why haſt thou ſlain my Salgar? why, O Salgar! haſt thou ſlain my brother? Dear were ye both to me! what ſhall I ſay in your praiſe? Thou wert fair on the hill among thouſands; he was
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0509500400:240"/>
terrible in fight. Speak to me; hear my voice, ſons of my-love! But alas! they are ſilent; ſilent for ever! Cold are their breaſts of clay!</p>
               <p>OH! from the rock of the hill; from the top of the windy mountain, ſpeak ye ghoſts of the dead! ſpeak, I will not be afraid.—Whither are ye gone to reſt? In what cave of the hill ſhall I find you? No feeble voice is on the wind: no anſwer half-drowned in the ſtorms of the hill.</p>
               <p>I SIT in my grief. I wait for morning in my tears. Rear the tomb, ye friends of the dead; but cloſe it not till Colma come. My life flies away like a dream: why ſhould I ſtay behind? Here ſhall I reſt with my friends, by the ſtream of the ſounding rock. When night comes on the hill; when the wind is on the heath; my ghoſt ſhall ſtand in the wind, and mourn the death of my friends. The hunter ſhall hear from his booth. He ſhall fear but love my voice. For ſweet ſhall my voice be for my friends; for pleaſant were they both to me.</p>

            <p>SUCH was thy ſong, Minona ſoftly-bluſhing maid of Torman. Our tears deſcended for Colma, and our ſouls were ſad.—Ullin came with the harp, and gave the ſong of Alpin.—The voice of Alpin was pleaſant: the ſoul of Ryno was a beam of fire. But they had reſted in the narrow houſe: and their voice was not heard in Selma.—Ullin had returned one day from the chace, before the heroes fell. He heard their ſtrife on the hill; their ſong was ſoft but ſad. They mourned the fall of Morar, firſt of mortal men. His ſoul was like the ſoul of Fingal; his ſword like the ſword of Oſcar.—But he fell, and his father mourned: his ſiſter's eyes were full of tears.—Minona's eyes were full of tears, the ſiſter of car-borne

               <p>THE wind and the rain are over: calm is the noon of day. The clouds are divided in heaven. Over the green hills flies the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſun. Red through the ſtony vale comes down the ſtream of the hill. Sweet are thy murmurs, O ſtream! but more ſweet is the voice I hear. It is the voice of Alpin, the ſon of the ſong, mourning for the dead. Bent is his head of age, and red his tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye. Alpin, thou ſon of the ſong, why alone on the ſilent hill? why complaineſt thou, as a blaſt in the wood; as a wave on the lonely ſhore?</p>

               <p>MY tears, O Ryno! are for the dead; my voice, for the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the grave. Tall thou art on the hill; fair among the ſons of the plain. But thou ſhalt fall like Morar<note n="*" place="bottom">Mór-ér, <hi>great man.</hi>

            </sp>
            <p>THOU wert ſwift, O Morar! as a roe on the hill; terrible as a meteor of fire. Thy wrath was as the ſtorm. Thy ſword in battle, as lightning in the field. Thy voice was like a ſtream after rain; like thunder on diſtant hills. Many fell by thy arm; they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in the flames of thy wrath.</p>
            <p>BUT when thou didſt return from war, how peaceful was thy brow! Thy face was like the ſun after rain; like the moon in the

ſilence of night; calm as the breaſt of the lake when the loud wind is laid.</p>
            <p>NARROW is thy dwelling now; dark the place of thine abode. With three ſteps I compaſs thy grave, O thou who waſt ſo great before! Four ſtones, with their heads of moſs, are the only memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of thee. A tree with ſcarce a leaf, long graſs which whiſtles in the wind, mark to the hunter's eye the grave of the mighty Morar. Morar! thou art low indeed. Thou haſt no mother to mourn thee; no maid with her tears of love. Dead is ſhe that brought thee forth. Fallen is the daughter of Morglan.</p>
            <p>WHO on his ſtaff is this? who is this, whoſe head is white with age, whoſe eyes are red with tears, who quakes at every ſtep.—It is thy father<note n="*" place="bottom">Torman, the ſon of Carthul, lord of I-mora, one of the weſtern iſles.</note>, O Morar! the father of no ſon but thee. He heard of thy fame in battle; he heard of foes diſperſed. He heard of Morar's fame; why did he not hear of his wound? Weep, thou father of Morar! weep; but thy ſon heareth thee not. Deep is the ſleep of the dead; low their pillow of duſt. No more ſhall he hear thy voice; no more ſhall he awake at thy call. When ſhall it be morn in the grave, to bid the ſlumberer awake?</p>
            <p>FAREWEL, thou braveſt of men! thou conqueror in the field! but the field ſhall ſee thee no more; nor the dark wood be lightened with the ſplendor of thy ſteel. Thou haſt left no ſon. But the ſong ſhall preſerve thy name. Future times ſhall hear of thee; they ſhall hear of the fallen Morar.</p>

The ſong comes, with its muſic, to melt and pleaſe the ſoul. It is like ſoft miſt, that, riſing from a lake, pours on the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vale; the green flowers are filled with dew, but the ſun re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns in his ſtrength, and the miſt is gone.

            <p>SAD! I am indeed: nor ſmall my cauſe of woe!—Carmor, thou haſt loſt no ſon; thou haſt loſt no daughter of beauty. Colgar the valiant lives; and Annira faireſt maid. The boughs of thy family flouriſh, O Carmor! but Armin is the laſt of his race. Dark is thy bed, O Daura! and deep thy ſleep in the tomb.—When ſhalt thou awake with thy ſongs? with all thy voice of muſic?</p>
            <p>RISE, winds of autumn, riſe; blow upon the dark heath! ſtreams of the mountains, roar! howl, ye tempeſts, in the top of the oak! walk through broken clouds, O moon! ſhow by intervals thy pale face! bring to my mind that ſad night, when all my children fell; when Arindal the mighty fell; when Dura the lovely failed.</p>
            <p>DAURA, my daughter! thou wert fair; fair as the moon on the hills of Fura<note n="†" place="bottom">Fuar-a, <hi>cold iſland.</hi>
               </note>; white as the driven ſnow; ſweet as the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gale. Arindal, thy bow was ſtrong, thy ſpear was ſwift in the field: thy look was like miſt on the wave; thy ſhield, a red cloud in a ſtorm. Armar, renowned in war, came, and ſought Daura's love; he was not long denied; fair was the hope of their friends.</p>

ERATH, ſon of Odgal, repined; for his brother was ſlain by Armar. He came diſguiſed like a ſon of the ſea: fair was his ſkiff on the wave; white his locks of age; calm his ſerious brow. Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of women, he ſaid, lovely daughter of Armin! a rock not diſtant in the ſea, bears a tree on its ſide; red ſhines the fruit afar. There Armor waits for Daura. I came to carry his love along the roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſea.</p>
            <p>SHE went; and ſhe called on Armar. Nought anſwered, but the ſon<note n="*" place="bottom">By <hi>the ſon of the rock</hi> the poet means the ecchoing back of the human voice from a rock. The vulgar were of opinion, that this repetition of found was made by a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within the rock; and they, on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, called it <hi>mac-talla; the ſon who dwells in the rock.</hi>
               </note> of the rock. Armor, my love! my love! why tormenteſt thou me with fear? hear, ſon of Ardnart, hear: it is Daura who calleth thee! Erath the traitor fled laughing to the land. She lifted up her voice, and cried for her brother and her father. Arin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal! Armin! none to relieve your Daura.</p>
            <p>HER voice came over the ſea. Arindal my ſon deſcended from the hill; rough in the ſpoils of the chace. His arrows rattled by his ſide; his bow was in his hand: five dark gray dogs attended his ſteps. He ſaw fierce Erath on the ſhore: he ſeized and bound him to an oak. Thick fly the thongs<note n="†" place="bottom">The poet here only means that Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath was bound with leathern thongs.</note> of the hide around his limbs; he loads the wind with his groans.</p>
            <p>ARINDAL aſcends the deep in his boat, to bring Daura to land. Armar came in his wrath, and let fly the gray-feathered ſhaft. It ſung; it ſunk in thy heart, O Arindal my ſon! for Erath the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor thou diedſt. The oar is ſtopped at once; he panted on the rock
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0509500400:245"/>
and expired. What is thy grief, O Daura, when round thy feet is poured thy brother's blood.</p>
            <p>THE boat is broken in twain by the waves. Armar plunges into the ſea, to reſcue his Daura or die. Sudden a blaſt from the hill comes over the waves. He ſunk, and he roſe no more.</p>
            <p>ALONE, on the ſea-beat rock, my daughter was heard to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. Frequent and loud were her cries; nor could her father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her. All night I ſtood on the ſhore. I ſaw her by the faint beam of the moon. All night I heard her cries. Loud was the wind; and the rain beat hard on the ſide of the mountain. Before morning appeared, her voice was weak. It died away, like the evening-breeze among the graſs of the rocks. Spent with grief ſhe expired. And left thee Armin alone: gone is my ſtrength in the war, and fallen my pride among women.</p>
            <p>WHEN the ſtorms of the mountain come; when the north lifts the waves on high; I ſit by the ſounding ſhore, and look on the fatal rock. Often by the ſetting moon I ſee the ghoſts of my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Half-viewleſs, they walk in mournful conference together. Will none of you ſpeak in pity? They do not regard their father. I am ſad, O Carmor, nor ſmall my cauſe of woe!</p>
            <p>SUCH were the words of the bards in the days of the ſong; when the king heard the muſic of harps, and the tales of other times. The chiefs gathered from all their hills, and heard the lovely ſound. They praiſed the voice<note n="*" place="bottom">Oſſian is ſometimes poetically called <hi>the voice of Cona.</hi>
               </note> of Cona! the firſt among a thouſand bards. But age is now on my tongue; and my ſoul has failed. I hear,

ſometimes, the ghoſts of bards, and learn their pleaſant ſong. But memory fails on my mind; I hear the call of years. They ſay, as they paſs along, why does Oſſian ſing? Soon ſhall he lie in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row houſe, and no bard ſhall raiſe his fame.</p>
            <p>ROLL on, ye dark-brown years, for ye bring no joy on your courſe. Let the tomb open to Oſſian, for his ſtrength has failed. The ſons of the ſong are gone to reſt; my voice remains, like a blaſt, that roars, lonely, on a ſea-ſurrounded rock, after the winds are laid. The dark moſs whiſtles there, and the diſtant mariner ſees the waving trees.</p>

                  <p>This piece, as many more of Oſſian's compoſitions, is addreſſed to one of the firſt Chriſtian miſſionaries.—The ſtory of the poem is handed down, by tradition, thus—In the country of the Britons between the walls, two chiefs lived in the days of Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, Dunthalmo, lord of Teutha, ſuppoſed to be the Tweed; and Rathmor, who dwelt at Clutha, well known to be the river Clyde.—Rathmor was not more renowned for his generoſity and hoſpitality, than Dunthalmo was infamous for his cruelty and ambition.—Dunthalmo, thro' envy, or on account of ſome private ſeuds, which ſubſiſted between the families, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Cathmor at a ſeaſt; but being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards touched with remorſe, he educated the two ſons of Rathmor, Calthon and Colmar, in his own houſe.—They grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to man's eſtate, dropped ſome hints that they intended to revenge the death of their father, upon which Dunthalmo ſhut them up in two caves on the banks of Teutha, intending to take them off pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately.—Colmal, the daughter of Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalmo, who was ſecretly in love with Calthon, helped him to make his eſcape from priſon, and ſled with him to Fingal, diſguiſed in the habit of a young warrior, and implored his aid againſt Dunthalmo.—Fingal ſent Oſſian with three hundred men, to Colmar's relief.—Dunthalmo hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing previouſly murdered Colmar, came to a battle with Oſſian; but he was killed by that hero, and his army totally defeated.</p>

COLMAR and Calthon were young, the ſons of car-borne Rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. They came, in the joy of youth, into their father's hall.

            <p>THEY ſaw the ſallen walls of their fathers; they ſaw the green thorn in the hall. Their tears deſcended in ſecret; and, at times, their faces were mournful. Dunthalmo beheld their grief: his darkening ſoul deſigned their death. He cloſed them in two caves, on the ecchoing banks of Teutha. The ſun did not come there with his beams; nor the moon of heaven by night. The ſons of Rathmor remained in darkneſs, and ſoreſaw their death.</p>
            <p>THE daughter of Dunthalmo wept in ſilence, the fair-haired, blue-eyed Colmal<note n="‖" place="bottom">Caol-mhal, <hi>a woman with ſmall eye-brows;</hi> ſmall eye-brows were a diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of beauty in Oſſian's time: and he ſeldom fails to give them to the ſine women of his poems.</note>. Her eye had rolled in ſecret on Calthon; his lovelineſs ſwelled in her ſoul. She trembled for her warrior; but what could Colmal do? Her arm could not lift the ſpear; nor was the ſword ſormed for her ſide. Her white breaſt never roſe beneath a mail. Neither was her eye the terror of heroes. What canſt thou do, O Colmal! for the falling chief?—Her ſteps are unequal; her hair is looſe: her eye looked wildly through her tears.—She

Or art thou the ſon of Lamgal, the chief I often ſaw in Clutha? But will I fly to Fingal, and Colmar my brother low? Will I fly to Morven, and the hero cloſed in night? No: give me that ſpear, ſon of Lamgal, Calthon will defend his brother.</p>
            <p>A THOUSAND heroes, replied the maid, ſtretch their ſpears round car-borne Colmar. What can Calthon do againſt a hoſt ſo great? Let us fly to the king of Morven, he will come with battle. His arm is ſtretched forth to the unhappy; the lightning of his ſword is round the weak.—Ariſe, thou ſon of Rathmor; the ſhadows will fly away. Dunthalmo will behold thy ſteps on the field, and thou muſt fall in thy youth.</p>

THE ſighing hero roſe; his tears deſcend for car-borne Colmar. He came with the maid to Selma's hall; but he knew not that it was Colmal. The helmet cover'd her lovely face; and her breaſt roſe beneath the ſteel. Fingal returned from the chace, and found the lovely ſtrangers. They were like two beams of light, in the midſt of the hall.</p>
            <p>THE kind heard the tale of grief; and turned his eyes around. A thouſand heroes half-roſe before him; claiming the war of Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha.—I came with my ſpear from the hill, and the joy of battle roſe in my breaſt: for the king ſpoke to Oſſian in the midſt of the people.</p>
            <p>SON of my ſtrength, he ſaid, take the ſpear of Fingal; go to Teutha's mighty ſtream, and ſave the car-borne Colmar.—Let thy fame return before thee like a pleaſant gale; that my ſoul may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice over my ſon, who renews the renown of our fathers.—Oſſian! be thou a ſtorm in battle; but mild when the foes are low!—It was thus my fame aroſe, O my ſon; and be thou like Selma's chief.—When the haughty come to my halls, my eyes behold them not. But my arm is ſtretched forth to the unhappy. My ſword defends the weak.</p>
            <p>I REJOICED in the words of the king: and took my rattling arms.—Diaran<note n="*" place="bottom">Diaran, father of that Connal who was unfortunately killed by Crimora, his miſtreſs.</note> roſe at my ſide, and Dargo<note n="†" place="bottom">Dargo, the ſon of Collath, is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in other poems by Oſſian. He is ſaid to have been killed by a boar at a hunting party. The lamentation of his miſtreſs, or wiſe, Mingala, over his body, is extant; but whether it is of Oſſian's compoſition, I cannot determine. It is generally aſcribed to him, and has much of his manner; but ſome traditions mention it as an imitation by ſome later bard.—As it has ſome poetical merit, I have ſubjoined it.

                     <p>THE ſpouſe of Dargo comes in tears: for Dargo was no more! The heroes figh over Lartho's chief: and what ſhall ſad Mingala do? The dark ſoul vaniſhed like morning miſt, before the king of ſpears: but the generous glowed in his preſence like the morning ſtar.</p>

Three hundred youths followed our ſteps: the lovely ſtrangers were at my ſide. Dunthalmo heard the ſound of our approach; he gathered the ſtrength of Teutha.—He ſtood on a hill with his hoſt; they were like rocks broken with thunder, when their bent trees are ſinged and bare, and the ſtreams of their chinks have failed.</p>
            <p>THE ſtream of Teutha rolled, in its pride, before the gloomy foe. I ſent a bard to Dunthalmo, to offer the combat on the plain; but he ſmiled in the darkneſs of his pride.—His unſettled hoſt moved on the hill; like the mountain-cloud, when the blaſt has entered its womb, and ſcatters the curling gloom on every ſide.</p>
            <p>THEY brought Colmar to Teutha's bank, bound with a thouſand thongs. The chief is ſad, but lovely, and his eye is on his friends; for we ſtood, in our arms, on the oppoſite bank of Teutha. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalmo
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0509500400:253"/>
came with his ſpear, and pierced the hero's ſide: he rolled on the bank in his blood, and we heard his broken ſighs.</p>
            <p>CALTHON ruſhed into the ſtream: I bounded forward on my ſpear. Teutha's race fell before us. Night came rolling down. Dunthalmo reſted on a rock, amidſt an aged wood. The rage of his boſom burned againſt the car-borne Calthon.—But Calthon ſtood in his grief; he mourned the fallen Colmar; Colmar ſlain in youth, before his fame aroſe.</p>
            <p>I BADE the ſong of woe to riſe, to ſooth the mournful chief; but he ſtood beneath a tree, and often threw his ſpear on earth.—The humid eye of Colmal rolled near in a ſecret tear: ſhe foreſaw the fall of Dunthalmo, or of Clutha's battling chief.</p>
            <p>Now half the night had paſſed away. Silence and darkneſs were on the field; ſleep reſted on the eyes of the heroes: Calthon's ſettling ſoul was ſtill. His eyes were half-cloſed; but the murmur of Teutha had not yet failed in his ear.—Pale, and ſhewing his wounds, the ghoſt of Colmar came: he bended his head over the hero, and raiſed his feeble voice.</p>
            <p>SLEEPS the ſon of Rathmor in his night, and his brother low? Did we not riſe to the chace together, and purſue the dark-brown hinds? Colmar was not forgot till he fell; till death had blaſted his youth. I lie pale beneath the rock of Lona. O let Calthon riſe! the morning comes with its beams; and Dunthalmo will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour the fallen.</p>
            <p>HE paſſed away in his blaſt. The riſing Calthon ſaw the ſteps of his departure.—He ruſhed in the ſound of his ſteel; and unhappy Colmal roſe. She followed her hero through night, and dragged
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0509500400:254"/>
her ſpear behind.—But when Calthon came to Lona's rock, he found his fallen brother—The rage of his boſom roſe, and he ruſhed among the foe. The groans of death aſcend. They cloſe around the chief.—He is bound in the midſt, and brought to gloomy Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalmo.—The ſhout of joy aroſe; and the hills of night replied.—</p>
            <p>I ſtarted at the ſound: and took my father's ſpear. Diaran roſe at my ſide; and the youthful ſtrength of Dargo. We miſſed the chief of Clutha, and our ſouls were ſad.—I dreaded the departure of my fame; the pride of my valour roſe.</p>
            <p>SONS of Morven, I ſaid, it is not thus our fathers fought. They reſted not on the field of ſtrangers, when the foe did not fall before them.—Their ſtrength was like the eagles of heaven; their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown is in the ſong. But our people fall by degrees, and our fame begins to depart.—What ſhall the king of Morven ſay, if Oſſian conquers not at Teutha? Riſe in your ſteel, ye warriors, and ſollow the ſound of Oſſian's courſe. He will not return, but renowned, to the echoing walls of Selma.</p>
            <p>MORNING roſe on the blue waters of Teutha; Colmal ſtood before me in tears. She told of the chief of Clutha: and thrice the ſpear fell from her hand. My wrath turned againſt the ſtranger; for my ſoul trembled for Calthon.</p>
            <p>SON of the feeble hand, I ſaid, do Teutha's warriors fight with tears? The battle is not won with grief; nor dwells the ſigh in the ſoul of war.—Go to the deer of Carmun, or the lowing herds of Teutha.—But leave theſe arms, thou ſon of fear; a warrior may lift them in battle.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0509500400:255"/>
I tore the mail from her ſhoulders. Her ſnowy breaſt appeared. She bent her red face to the ground.—I looked in ſilence to the chiefs. The ſpear fell from my hand; and the ſigh of my boſom roſe.—But when I heard the name of the maid, my crowding tears deſcended. I bleſſed the lovely beam of youth, and bade the battle move.—</p>
            <p>WHY, ſon of the rock, ſhould Oſſian tell how Teutha's warriors died? They are now forgot in their land; and their tombs are not found on the heath.—Years came on with their tempeſts; and the green mounds mouldered away.—Scarce is the grave of Dunthalmo ſeen, or the place where he fell by the ſpear of Oſſian.—Some gray warrior, half blind with age, ſitting by night at the flaming oak of the hall, tells now my actions to his ſons, and the fall of the dark Dunthalmo. The ſaces of youth bend ſidelong towards his voice; ſurprize and joy burn in their eyes.—</p>
            <p>I FOUND the ſon<note n="*" place="bottom">Calthon.</note> of Rathmor bound to an oak; my ſword cut the thongs from his hands. And I gave him the white-boſomed Colmal.—They dwelt in the halls of Teutha; and Oſſian returned to Selma.</p>

            <head>LATHMON: A POEM<note n="*" place="bottom">Lathmon a Britiſh prince, taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Fingal's abſence in Ireland, made a deſcent on Morven, and advanced within ſight of Selma the royal palace. Fingal arrived in the mean time, and Lath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon retreated to a hill, where his army was ſurprized by night, and himſelf taken priſoner by Oſſian and Gaul the ſon of Morni. This exploit of Gaul and Oſſian bears a near reſemblance to the beautiful epiſode of Niſus and Euryalus in Virgil's ninth Aeneid. The poem opens, with the firſt appearance of Fingal on the coaſt of Morven, and ends, it may be ſuppoſed, about noon the next day. The firſt para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph is in a lyric meaſure, and appears to have been ſung, of old, to the harp, as a prelude to the narrative part of the poem, which is in heroic verſe.</note>.</head>
            <p>SELMA, thy halls are ſilent. There is no ſound in the woods of Morven. The wave tumbles alone on the coast. The ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beam of the ſun is on the field. The daughters of Morven come forth, like the bow of the ſhower; they look towards green Ullin for the white ſails of the king. He had promiſed to return, but the winds of the north aroſe.</p>
            <p>WHO pours from the eaſtern hill, like a ſtream of darkneſs? It is the hoſt of Lathmon. He has heard of the abſence of Fingal. He truſts in the wind of the north. His ſoul brightens with joy. Why doſt thou come, Lathmon? The mighty are not in Selma. Why comeſt thou with thy forward ſpear? Will the daughters of Morven fight? But ſtop, O mighty ſtream, in thy courſe! Does not Lathmon behold theſe ſails? Why doſt thou vaniſh, Lathmon,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0509500400:257"/>
like the miſt of the lake? But the ſqually ſtorm is behind thee; Fingal purſues thy ſteps!</p>
            <p>THE king of Morven ſtarted from ſleep, as we rolled on the dark-blue wave. He ſtretched his hand to his ſpear, and his heroes roſe around. We knew that he had ſeen his fathers, for they often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to his dreams, when the ſword of the foe roſe over the land; and the battle darkened before us.</p>
            <p>WHITHER haſt thou fled, O wind, ſaid the king of Morven? Doſt thou ruſtle in the chambers of the ſouth, and purſue the ſhower in other lands? Why doſt thou not come to my ſails? to the blue face of my ſeas? The foe is in the land of Morven, and the king is abſent. But let each bind on his mail, and each aſſume his ſhield. Stretch every ſpear over the wave; let every ſword be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheathed. Lathmon<note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſaid, by tradition, that it was the intelligence of Lathmon's invaſion, that occaſioned Fingal's return from Ireland; though Oſſion, more poetically, aſcribes the cauſe of Fingal's knowledge to his dream.</note> is before us with his hoſt: he that fled<note n="†" place="bottom">He alludes to a battle wherein Fingal had defeated Lathmon.

            <p>SUCH were the words of Fingal. We ruſhed into Carmona's bay. Oſſian aſcended the hill; and thrice ſtruck his boſſy ſhield. The rock of Morven replied; and the bounding roes came forth. The foes were troubled in my preſence: and collected their darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hoſt; for I ſtood, like a cloud on the hill, rejoicing in the arma of my youth.</p>

MORNI<note n="*" place="bottom">Morni was chief of a numerous tribe, in the days of Fingal and his father Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal. The laſt mentioned hero was killed in battle againſt Morni's tribe; but the valour and conduct of Fingal reduced them, at laſt, to obedience. We find the two heroes perfectly reconciled in this poem.</note> ſat beneath a tree, at the roaring waters of Strumon<note n="†" place="bottom">Stru'-moné, <hi>ſtream of the hill.</hi> Here the proper name of rivulet in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Selma.</note>: his locks of age are gray: he leans forward on his ſtaff; young Gaul is near the hero, hearing the battles of his youth. Often did he riſe, in the fire of his ſoul, at the mighty deeds of Morni.</p>
            <p>THE aged heard the ſound of Oſſian's ſhield: he knew the ſign of battle. He ſtarted at once from his place. His gray hair part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his back. He remembers the actions of other years. My ſon, he ſaid to fair haired Gaul, I hear the ſound of battle. The king of Morven is returned, the ſign of war is heard. Go to the halls of Strumon, and bring his arms to Morni. Bring the arms which my father wore in his age, for my arm begins to fail. Take thou thy armour, O Gaul; and ruſh to the firſt of thy battles. Let thine arm reach to the renown of thy fathers. Be thy courſe in the field, like the eagle's wing. Why ſhouldſt thou fear death, my ſon! the valiant fall with fame; their ſhields turn the dark ſtream of danger away, and renown dwells on their gray hairs. Doſt thou not ſee, O Gaul, how the ſteps of my age are honoured? Morni moves forth, and the young meet him, with reverence, and turn their eyes, with ſilent joy, on his courſe. But I never fled from danger, my ſon! my ſword lightened through the darkneſs of battle. The ſtranger melted before me; the mighty were blaſted in my preſence.</p>
            <p>GAUL brought the arms to Morni: the aged warrior covered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſteel. He took the ſpear in his hand, which was often
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0509500400:259"/>
ſtained with the blood of the valiant. He came towards Fingal, his ſon attended his ſteps. The ſon of Comhal rejoiced over the warrior, when he came in the locks of his age.</p>
            <p>KING of the roaring Strumon! ſaid the riſing joy of Fingal; do I behold thee in arms, after thy ſtrength has failed? Often has Morni ſhone in battles, like the beam of the riſing ſun; when he diſperſes the ſtorms of the hill, and brings peace to the glittering fields. But why didſt thou not reſt in thine age? Thy renown is in the ſong. The people behold thee, and bleſs the departure of mighty Morni. Why didſt thou not reſt in thine age? For the foe will vaniſh before Fingal.</p>
            <p>SON of Comhal, replied the chief, the ſtrength of Morni's arm has failed. I attempt to draw the ſword of my youth, but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in its place. I throw the ſpear, but it falls ſhort of the mark; and I feel the weight of my ſhield. We decay, like the graſs of the mountain, and our ſtrength returns no more. I have a ſon, O Fingal, his ſoul has delighted in the actions of Morni's youth; but his ſword has not been lifted againſt the foe, neither has his fame begun. I come with him to battle; to direct his arm. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown will be a ſun to my ſoul, in the dark hour of my departure. O that the name of Morni were forgot among the people! that the heroes would only ſay, <q rend="inline">"Behold the father of Gaul!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>KING of Strumon, Fingal replied, Gaul ſhall lift the ſword in battle. But he ſhall lift it before Fingal; my arm ſhall defend his youth. But reſt thou in the halls of Selma; and hear of our renown. Bid the harp be ſtrung; and the voice of the bard ariſe, that thoſe who fall may rejoice in their fame; and the ſoul of Morni brighten with gladneſs.—Oſſian! thou haſt ſought in

battles: the blood of ſtrangers is on thy ſpear: let thy courſe be with Gaul in the ſtrife; but depart not from the ſide of Fingal; leſt the foe find you alone, and your fame fail at once.</p>
            <p>I SAW<note n="*" place="bottom">Oſſian ſpeaks. The contraſt between the old and young heroes is ſtrongly mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

            <p>NIGHT came down on Morven. Fingal ſat at the beam of the oak. Morni ſat by his ſide with all his gray waving locks. Their diſcourſe is of other times, and the actions of their fathers. Three bards, at times, touched the harp; and Ullin was near with his ſong. He ſung of the mighty Comhal; but darkneſs gathered<note n="†" place="bottom">Ullin had choſen ill the ſubject of his ſong. The <hi>darkneſs which gathered on Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni's brow,</hi> did not proceed from any diſlike he had to Comhal's name, though they were foes, but from his fear that the ſong would awaken Fingal to remembrance of the feuds which had ſubſiſted of old be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the families.

Fingal obſerved the aged hero, and he mildly ſpoke.</p>
            <p>CHIEF of Strumon, why that darkneſs? Let the days of other years be forgot. Our fathers contended in battle; but we meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, at the feaſt.

My eyes were full of tears, when the king of heroes ſell. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant fall, O Fingal, and the feeble remain on the hills. How many heroes have paſſed away, in the days of Morni! And I did not ſhun the battle; neither did I fly from the ſtrife of the valiant.</p>
            <p>Now let the friends of Fingal reſt; for the night is around; that they may riſe, with ſtrength, to battle againſt car-borne Lathmon. I hear the ſound of his hoſt, like thunder heard on a diſtant heath. Oſſian! and fair-haired Gaul! ye are ſwift in the race. Obſerve the foes of Fingal from that woody hill. But approach them not, your fathers are not near to ſhield you. Let not your fame fall at once. The valour of youth may fail.</p>
            <p>WE heard the words of the chief with joy, and moved in the clang of our arms. Our ſteps are on the woody hill. Heaven burns with all its ſtars. The meteors of death fly over the field. The diſtant noiſe of the foe reached our ears. It was then Gaul ſpoke, in his valour; his hand half-unſheathed the ſword.</p>
            <p>SON of Fingal, he ſaid, why burns the ſoul of Gaul? My heart beats high. My ſteps are diſordered; and my hand trembles on my ſword. When I look towards the foe, my ſoul lightens before me, and I ſee their ſleeping hoſt. Tremble thus the ſouls of the valiant in battles of the ſpear?—How would the ſoul of Morni riſe if we
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0509500400:262"/>
ſhould ruſh on the foe! Our renown would grow in the ſong; and our ſteps be ſtately in the eyes of the brave.</p>
            <p>SON of Morni, I replied, my ſoul delights in battle. I delight to ſhine in battle alone, and to give my name to the bards. But what if the foe ſhould prevail; ſhall I behold the eyes of the king? They are terrible in his diſpleaſure, and like the flames of death.—But I will not behold them in his wrath. Oſſian ſhall prevail or fall. But ſhall the fame of the vanquiſhed riſe?—They paſs away like a ſhadow. But the fame of Oſſian ſhall riſe. His deeds ſhall be like his fathers. Let us ruſh in our arms; ſon of Morni, let us ruſh to battle. Gaul! if thou ſhalt return, go to Selma's lofty wall.

            <p>SON of Fingal, Gaul replied with a ſigh; will I return after Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian is low!—What would my father ſay, and Fingal king of men? The feeble would turn their eyes and ſay, <q rend="inline">"Behold the mighty Gaul who left his friend in his blood!"</q> Ye ſhall not behold me, ye feeble, but in the midſt of my renown. Oſſian!

            <p>SON of Morni, I replied and ſtrode before him on the heath, our fathers ſhall praiſe our valour, when they mourn our fall. A beam of gladneſs ſhall riſe on their ſouls, when their eyes are full of tears. They will ſay, <q rend="inline">"Our ſons have not fallen like the graſs of the field, for they ſpread death around them."</q>—But why
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0509500400:263"/>
ſhould we think of the narrow houſe? The ſword defends the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant. But death purſues the flight of the feeble; and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown is not heard.</p>
            <p>WE ruſhed forward through night; and came to the roar of a ſtream which bent its blue courſe round the foe, through trees that ecchoed to its noiſe; we came to the bank of the ſtream, and ſaw the ſleeping hoſt. Their fires were decayed on the plain; and the lonely ſteps of their ſcouts were diſtant far. I ſtretched my ſpear before me to ſupport my ſteps over the ſtream. But Gaul took my hand, and ſpoke the words of the valiant.</p>
            <p>SHALL<note n="*" place="bottom">This propoſal of Gaul is much more noble, and more agreeable to true heroiſm, than the behaviour of Ulyſſes and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Iliad, or that of Niſus and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryalus in the Aeneid.

Strike, Oſſian, ſtrike the ſhield of battle, and let their thouſands riſe. Let them meet Gaul in his firſt battle, that he may try the ſtrength of his arm.</p>
            <p>MY ſoul rejoiced over the warrior, and my burſting tears de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended. And the foe ſhall meet Gaul, I ſaid: the fame of Morni's ſon ſhall ariſe.

            <p>I STRUCK thrice my ecchoing ſhield. The ſtarting foe aroſe. We ruſhed on in the ſound of our arms. Their crouded ſteps fly over the heath; for they thought that the mighty Fingal came; and the ſtrength of their arms withered away. The ſound of their flight was like that of flame, when it ruſhes thro' the blaſted groves.</p>
            <p>IT was then the ſpear of Gaul flew in its ſtrength; it was then his ſword aroſe. Cremor fell; and mighty Leth. Dunthormo ſtruggled in his blood. The ſteel ruſhed through Crotho's ſide, as bent, he roſe on his ſpear; the black ſtream poured from the wound, and hiſſed on the half-extinguiſhed oak. Cathmin ſaw the ſteps of the hero behind him, and aſcended a blaſted tree; but the ſpear pierced him from behind. Shrieking, panting, he fell; moſs and withered branches purſue his fall, and ſtrew the blue arms of Gaul.</p>
            <p>SUCH were thy deeds, ſon of Morni, in the firſt of thy battles. Nor ſlept the ſword by thy ſide, thou laſt of Fingal's race! Oſſian ruſhed forward in his ſtrength, and the people fell before him; as the graſs by the ſtaff of the boy, when he whiſtles along the field, and the gray beard of the thiſtle falls. But careleſs the youth moves on; his ſteps are towards the deſart.</p>
            <p>GRAY morning roſe around us, the winding ſtreams are bright along the heath. The foe gathered on a hill; and the rage of Lath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon roſe. He bent the red eye of his wrath: he is ſilent in his riſing grief. He often ſtruck his boſſy ſhield; and his ſteps are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal on the heath. I ſaw the diſtant darkneſs of the hero, and I ſpoke to Morni's ſon.</p>

The cuſtom of depreciating ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies is not altogether one of the refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of modern heroiſm. This railing diſpoſition is one of the capital faults in Homer's characters, which, by the bye, cannot be imputed to the poet, who kept to the manners of the times of which he wrote.

            <p>Go thou to the heroes, chief of Dutha, for I behold the ſtately ſteps of Oſſian. His fame is worthy of my ſteel; let him fight with Lathmon.</p>
            <p>THE noble Sulmath came. I rejoiced in the words of the king. I raiſed the ſhield on my arm; and Gaul placed in my hand the ſword of Morni. We returned to the murmuring ſtream; Lath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon came in his ſtrength. His dark hoſt rolled, like the clouds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him: but the ſon of Nuäth was bright in his ſteel.</p>
            <p>SON of Fingal, ſaid the hero, thy fame has grown on our fall. How many lie there of my people by thy hand, thou king of men! Lift now thy ſpear againſt Lathmon; and lay the ſon of Nuäth low. Lay him low among his people, or thou thyſelf muſt fall.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0509500400:267"/>
It ſhall never be told in my halls that my warriors fell in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; that they fell in the preſence of Lathmon when his ſword reſted by his ſide: the blue eyes of Cutha<note n="*" place="bottom">Cutha appears to have been Lathmon's wife or miſtreſs.</note> would roll in tears, and her ſteps be lonely in the vales of Dunlathmon.</p>
            <p>NEITHER ſhall it be told, I replied, that the ſon of Fingal fled. Were his ſteps covered with darkneſs, yet would not Oſſian fly; his ſoul would meet him and ſay, <q rend="inline">"Does the bard of Selma fear the foe?"</q> No: he does not fear the foe. His joy is in the midſt of battle.</p>
            <p>LATHMON came on with his ſpear, and pierced the ſhield of Oſſian. I felt the cold ſteel at my ſide; and drew the ſwored of Morni; I cut the ſpear in twain; the bright point fell glittering on the ground. The ſon of Nuäth burnt in his wrath, and lifted high his ſounding ſhield. His dark eyes rolled above it, as bending for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it ſhone like a gate of braſs. But Oſſian's ſpear pierced the brightneſs of its boſſes, and ſunk in a tree that roſe behind. The ſhield hung on the quivering lance! but Lathmon ſtill advanced. Gaul foreſaw the fall of the chief, and ſtretched his buckler before my ſword; when it deſcended, in a ſtream of light over the king of Dunlathmon.</p>
            <p>LATHMON beheld the ſon of Morni, and the tear ſtarted from his eye. He threw the ſword of his fathers on the ground, and ſpoke the words of the valiant. Why ſhould Lathmon fight againſt the firſt of mortal men? Your ſouls are beams from heaven; your ſwords the flames of death. Who can equal the renown of the heroes, whoſe actions are ſo great in youth! O that ye were in the halls of Nuäth, in the green dwelling of Lathmon! then would my father ſay, that his ſon did not yield to the feeble.—But who comes, a

            <p>FINGAL came, in his mildneſs, rejoicing in ſecret over the actions of his ſon. Morni's face brightened with gladneſs, and his aged eyes look faintly through the tears of joy. We came to the halls of Selma, and ſat round the feaſt of ſhells. The maids of the ſong came into our preſence, and the mildly bluſhing Evirallin. Her dark hair ſpreads on her neck of ſnow, her eye rolled in ſecret on Oſſian; ſhe touched the harp of muſic, and we bleſſed the daughter of Branno.</p>
            <p>FINGAL roſe in his place, and ſpoke to Dunlathmon's battling king. The ſword of Trenmor trembled by his ſide, as he lifted up his mighty arm. Son of Nuäth, he ſaid, why doſt thou ſearch for fame in Morven? We are not of the race of the feeble; nor do our ſwords gleam over the weak. When did we come to Dunlathmon, with the ſound of war? Fingal does not delight in battle, though his arm is ſtrong. My renown grows on the fall of the haughty. The lightning of my ſteel pours on the proud in arms. The battle comes; and the tombs of the valiant riſe; the tombs of my people riſe, O my fathers! and I at laſt muſt remain alone. But I will remain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, and the departure of my ſoul ſhall be one ſtream of light. Lathmon! retire to thy place. Turn thy battles to other lands. The race of Morven are renowned, and their foes are the ſons of the unhappy.</p>

            <head>OITHÓNA: A POEM<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Gaul, the ſon of Morni, attended Lathmon into his own country, after his being defeated in Morven, as related in the preceding poem. He was kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by Nuäth, the father of Lath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and fell in love with his daughter Oithona.—The lady was no leſs ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured of Gaul, and a day was fixed for their marriage. In the mean time Fingal, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for an expedition into the country of the Britons, ſent for Gaul. He obeyed, and went; but not without promiſing to Oithona to return, if he ſurvived the war, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day.—Lathmon too was obliged to attend his father Nuäth in his wars, and Oithona was left alone at Dunlathmon, the ſeat of the family.—Dunrommath, lord of Uthal, ſuppoſed to be one of the Ork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, taking advantage of the abſence of her friends, came and carried off, by force, Oithona, who had formerly reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his love, into Tromáthon, a deſart iſland, where he concealed her in a cave.</p>
                  <p>Gaul returned on the day appointed; heard of the rape, and ſailed to Tromá<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon, to revenge himſelf on Dunrom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>math. When he landed, he found Oi-thona diſconſolate, and reſolved not to ſurvive the loſs of her honour.—She told him the ſtory of her misfortunes, and ſhe ſcarce ended, when Dunrommath, with his followers, appeared at the further end of the iſland. Gaul prepared to attack him, recommending to Oithona to retire, till the battle was over.—She ſeemingly obeyed; but ſhe ſecretly armed herſelf, ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the thickeſt of the battle, and was mortally wounded.—Gaul purſuing the flying enemy, found her juſt expiring on the field: he mourned over her, raiſed her tomb, and returned to Morven.—Thus is the ſtory handed down by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor is it given with any material difference in the poem, which opens with Gaul's return to Dunlathmon, after the rape of Oithona.</p>

            <p>SUCH were the words of Gaul, when he came to Dunlathmon's towers. The gates were open and dark. The winds were bluſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the hall. The trees ſtrowed the threſhold with leaves; and the murmur of night is abroad.—Sad and ſilent, at a rock, the ſon of Morni ſat: his ſoul trembled for the maid; but he knew not

            <p>SLEEP deſcended on the heroes. The viſions of night aroſe. Oithona ſtood in a dream, before the eyes of Morni's ſon.

            <p>DAUGHTER of Nuäth, ſaid the hero, why doſt thou fly from Gaul? Do my eyes ſend forth the flame of death? Or darkens hatred in my ſoul? Thou art to me the beam of the eaſt riſing in a land unknown. But thou covereſt thy face with ſadneſs, daughter of high Dunlathmon! Is the foe of Oithona near? My ſoul burns to meet him in battle.

            <p>CAR-BORNE chief of Strumon, replied the ſighing maid, why comeſt thou over the dark-blue wave to Nuäth's mournful daughter? Why did I not paſs away in ſecret, like the flower of the rock, that lifts its fair head unſeen, and ſtrows its withered leaves on the blaſt? Why didſt thou come, O Gaul, to hear my departing ſigh? I paſs away in my youth; and my name ſhall not be heard. Or it will be heard with ſorrow, and the tears of Nuäth will fall. Thou wilt be ſad, ſon of Morni, for the fallen fame of Oithona. But ſhe ſhall ſleep in the narrow tomb, far from the voice of the mourner.—Why didſt thou come, chief of Strumon, to the ſea-beat rocks of Tromathon.</p>
            <p>I CAME to meet thy foes, daughter of car-borne Nuäth! the death of Cuthal's chief darkens before me; or Morni's ſon ſhall fall.—Oithona! when Gaul is low, raiſe my tomb on that oozy rock; and

when the dark-bounding ſhip ſhall paſs, call the ſons of the ſea; call them, and give this ſword, that they may carry it to Morni's hall; that the grey-haired hero may ceaſe to look towards the deſart for the return of his ſon.</p>
            <p>AND ſhall the daughter of Nuäth live, ſhe replied with a burſting ſigh? Shall I live in Tromáthon, and the ſon of Morni low? My heart is not of that rock; nor my ſoul careleſs as that ſea, which lifts its blue waves to every wind, and rolls beneath the ſtorm. The blaſt which ſhall lay thee low, ſhall ſpread the branches of Oithona on earth. We ſhall wither together, ſon of car-borne Morni!—The narrow houſe is pleaſant to me, and the gray ſtone of the dead: for never more will I leave thy rocks, ſea-ſurrounded Tromáthon!—Night<note n="*" place="bottom">Oithona relates how ſhe was carried away by Dunrommath.</note> came on with her clouds, after the departure of Lathmon, when he went to the wars of his fathers, to the moſs-covered rock of Duthórmoth; night came on, and I ſat in the hall, at the beam of the oak. The wind was abroad in the trees. I heard the ſound of arms. Joy roſe in my face; for I thought of thy return. It was the chief of Cuthal, the red-haired ſtrength of Dunrommath. His eyes rolled in fire: the blood of my people was on his ſword. They who defended Oithona fell by the gloomy chief.—What could I do? My arm was weak; it could not lift the ſpear. He took me in my grief, amidſt my tears he raiſed the ſail. He feared the returning ſtrength of Lathmon, the brother of unhappy Oithona.—But behold, he comes with his people! the dark wave is divided before him!—Whither wilt thou turn thy ſteps, ſon of Morni? Many are the warriors of Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rommath!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0509500400:274"/>
MY ſteps never turned from battle, replied the hero, as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheathed his ſword; and will I begin to fear, Oithona, when thy foes are near? Go to thy cave, daughter of Nuath, till our battle ceaſe. Son of Leth, bring the bows of our fathers; and the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quiver of Morni. Let our three warriors bend the yew. Our ſelves will lift the ſpear. They are an hoſt on the rock; but our ſouls are ſtrong.</p>
            <p>THE daughter of Nuäth went to the cave: a troubled joy roſe on her mind, like the red path of the lightning on a ſtormy cloud.—Her ſoul was reſolved, and the tear was dried from her wildly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking eye.—Dunrommath ſlowly approached; for he ſaw the ſon of Morni. Contempt contracted his face, a ſmile is on his dark-brown cheek; his red eye rolled, half-conceal'd, beneath his ſhaggy brows.</p>
            <p>WHENCE are the ſons of the ſea, begun the gloomy chief? Have the winds driven you to the rocks of Tromáthon? Or come you in ſearch of the white-handed daughter of Nuäth? The ſons of the unhappy, ye feeble men, come to the hand of Dunrommath. His eye ſpares not the weak; and he delights in the blood of ſtrangers. Oithona is a beam of light, and the chief of Cuthal enjoys it in ſecret; wouldſt thou come on its lovelineſs like a cloud, ſon of the feeble hand!—Thou mayſt come, but ſhalt thou return to the halls of thy fathers?</p>
            <p>DOST thou not know me, ſaid Gaul, red-haired chief of Cuthal? Thy feet were ſwift on the heath, in the battle of car-borne Lath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; when the ſword of Morni's ſon purſued his hoſt, in Morven's woody land. Dunrommath! thy words are mighty, for thy warriors
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0509500400:275"/>
gather behind thee. But do I fear them, ſon of pride? I am not of the race of the feeble.</p>
            <p>GAUL advanced in his arms; Dunrommath ſhrunk behind his people. But the ſpear of Gaul pierced the gloomy chief, and his ſword lopped off his head, as it bended in death.—The ſon of Morni ſhook it thrice by the lock; the warriors of Dunrommath fled. The arrows of Morven purſued them: ten fell on the moſſy rocks. The reſt lift the ſounding ſail, and bound on the eccho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deep.</p>
            <p>GAUL advanced towards the cave of Oithona. He beheld a youth leaning againſt a rock. An arrow had pierced his ſide; and his eye rolled faintly beneath his helmet.—The ſoul of Morni's ſon is ſad, he came and ſpoke the words of peace.</p>
            <p>CAN the hand of Gaul heal thee, youth of the mournful brow? I have ſearched for the herbs of the mountains; I have gathered them on the ſecret banks of their ſtreams. My hand has cloſed the wound of the valiant, and their eyes have bleſſed the ſon of Morni. Where dwelt thy fathers, warrior? Were they of the ſons of the mighty? Sadneſs ſhall come, like night, on thy native ſtreams; for thou art fallen in thy youth.—</p>
            <p>MY fathers, replied the ſtranger, were of the ſons of the mighty; but they ſhall not be ſad; for my fame is departed like morning miſt. High walls riſe on the banks of Duvranna; and ſee their moſſy towers in the ſtream; a rock aſcends behind them with its bending firs. Thou mayſt behold it far diſtant.

THE helmet fell from the hand of Gaul; for it was the wounded Oithona. She had armed herſelf in the cave, and came in ſearch of death. Her heavy eyes are half cloſed; the blood pours from her ſide.—</p>
            <p>SON of Morni, ſhe ſaid, prepare the narrow tomb. Sleep comes, like a cloud, on my ſoul. The eyes of Oithona are dim. O had I dwelt at Duvranna, in the bright beam of my fame! then had my years come on with joy; and the virgins would bleſs my ſteps. But I fall in youth, ſon of Morni, and my father ſhall bluſh in his hall.—</p>
            <p>SHE fell pale on the rock of Tromáthon. The mournful hero raiſed her tomb.—He came to Morven; but we ſaw the darkneſs of his ſoul. Oſſian took the harp in the praiſe of Oithona. The brightneſs of the face of Gaul returned. But his ſigh roſe, at times, in the midſt of his friends, like blaſts that ſhake their unfrequent wings, after the ſtormy winds are laid.</p>

            <head>CROMA: A POEM<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Malvina the daughter of Toſcar is overheard by Oſſian lamenting the death of Oſcar her lover. Oſſian, to divert her grief, relates his own actions in an ex edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he undertook, at Fingal's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to aid Crothar the petty king of Croma, a country in Ireland, againſt Roth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar who invaded his dominions. The ſtory is delivered down thus in tradition. Crothar king of Croma being blind with age, and his ſon too young for the field, Rothmar the chief of Tromlo reſolved to avail himſelf of the opportunity offered of annexing the dominions of Crothar to his own. He accordingly marched into the country ſubject to Crothar, but which he held of Arth or Artho, who was, at the time, ſupreme king of Ireland.</p>
                  <p>Crothar being, on account of his age and blindneſs, unfit for action, ſent for aid to Fingal king of Scotland; who ordered his ſon Oſſian to the relief of Crothar. But before his arrival Fovar-gormo, the ſon of Crothar, attacking Roth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, was ſlain himſelf, and his forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally defeated. Oſſian renewed the war; came to battle, killed Rothmar, and rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his army. Croma being thus delivered of its enemies, Oſſian returned to Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>

            <p>IT was the voice of my love! few are his viſits to the dreams of Malvina! Open your airy halls, ye fathers of mighty Toſcar. Unfold the gates of your clouds; the ſteps of Malvina's departure are near. I have heard a voice in my dream. I feel the fluttering of my ſoul. Why didſt thou come, O blaſt, from the dark-rolling of the lake? Thy ruſtling wing was in the trees, the dream of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina departed. But ſhe beheld her love, when his robe of miſt flew on the wind; the beam of the ſun was on his ſkirts, they glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered like the gold of the ſtranger. It was the voice of my love! few are his viſits to my dreams!</p>

BUT thou dwelleſt in the ſoul of Malvina, ſon of mighty Oſſian. My ſighs ariſe with the beam of the eaſt; my tears deſcend with the drops of night. I was a lovely tree, in thy preſence, Oſcar, with all my branches round me; but thy death came like a blaſt from the deſart, and laid my green head low; the ſpring returned with its ſhowers, but no leaf of mine aroſe. The virgins ſaw me ſilent in the hall, and they touched the harp of joy. The tear was on the cheek of Malvina: the virgins beheld me in my grief. Why art thou ſad, they ſaid; thou firſt of the maids of Lutha? Was he lovely as the beam of the morning, and ſtately in thy ſight?</p>
            <p>PLEASANT is thy ſong in Oſſian's ear, daughter of ſtreamy Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha! Thou haſt heard the muſic of departed bards in the dream of thy reſt, when ſleep fell on thine eyes, at the murmur of Moruth<note n="*" place="bottom">Mor'-ruth, <hi>great ſtream.</hi>
               </note>. When thou didſt return from the chace, in the day of the ſun, thou haſt heard the muſic of the bards, and thy ſong is lovely. It is lovely, O Malvina, but it melts the ſoul. There is a joy in grief when peace dwells in the breaſt of the ſad. But ſorrow waſtes the mournful, O daughter of Toſcar, and their days are few. They fall away, like the flower on which the ſun looks in his ſtrength after the mildew has paſſed over it, and its head is heavy with the drops of night. Attend to the tale of Oſſian, O maid; he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the days of his youth.</p>
            <p>THE king commanded; I raiſed my ſails, and ruſhed into the bay of Croma; into Croma's ſounding bay in lovely Inisfail<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Inisfail,</hi> one of the ancient names of Ireland.</note>. High on the coaſt aroſe the towers of Crothar king of ſpears; Crothar renowned in the battles of his youth; but age dwelt then around the chief. Rothmar raiſed the ſword againſt the hero; and the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0509500400:279"/>
wrath of Fingal burned. He ſent Oſſian to meet Rothmar in battle, for the chief of Croma was the companion of his youth.</p>
            <p>I SENT the bard before me with ſongs; I came into the hall of Crothar. There ſat the hero amidſt the arms of his fathers, but his eyes had failed. His gray locks waved around a ſtaff, on which the warrior leaned. He hummed the ſong of other times, when the ſound of our arms reached his ears. Crothar roſe, ſtretched his aged hand and bleſſed the ſon of Fingal.</p>
            <p>OSSIAN! ſaid the hero, the ſtrength of Crothar's arm has failed. O could I liſt the ſword, as on the day that Fingal fought at Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha! He was the firſt of mortal men; but Crothar had alſo his fame. The king of Morven praiſed me, and he placed on my arm the boſſy ſhield of Calthar, whom the hero had ſlain in war. Doſt thou not behold it on the wall, for Crothar's eyes have failed? Is thy ſtrength, like thy fathers, Oſſian? let the aged feel thine arm.</p>
            <p>I GAVE my arm to the king; he ſeels it with his aged hands. The ſigh roſe in his breaſt, and his tears deſcended. Thou art ſtrong, my ſon, he ſaid, but not like the king of Morven. But who is like the hero among the mighty in war! Let the feaſt of my halls be ſpread; and let my bards raiſe the ſong. Great is he that is within my walls, ſons of ecchoing Croma!</p>
            <p>THE feaſt is ſpread. The harp is heard; and joy is in the hall. But it was joy covering a ſigh, that darkly dwelt in every breaſt. It was like the faint beam of the moon ſpread on a cloud in heaven. At length the muſic ceaſed, and the aged king of Croma ſpoke; he ſpoke without a tear, but the ſigh ſwelled in the midſt of his voice.</p>

SON of Fingal! doſt thou not behold the darkneſs of Crothar's hall of ſhells? My ſoul was not dark at the feaſt, when my people lived. I rejoiced in the preſence of ſtrangers, when my ſon ſhone in the hall. But, Oſſian, he is a beam that is departed, and left no ſtreak of light behind. He is fallen, ſon of Fingal, in the battles of his father.—Rothmar the chief of graſſy Tromlo heard that my eyes had ſailed; he heard that my arms were fixed in the hall, and the pride of his ſoul aroſe. He came towards Croma; my people fell before him. I took my arms in the hall, but what could ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Crothar do? My ſteps were unequal; my grief was great. I wiſhed for the days that were paſt. Days! wherein I fought; and won in the field of blood. My ſon returned from the chace; the fair-haired Fovar-gormo<note n="*" place="bottom">Faobhar-gorm, <hi>the blue point of ſteel.</hi>
               </note>. He had not lifted his ſword in battle, for his arm was young. But the ſoul of the youth was great; the fire of valour burnt in his eyes. He ſaw the diſordered ſteps of his father, and his ſigh aroſe. King of Croma, he ſaid, is it becauſe thou haſt no ſon; is it for the weakneſs of Fovar-gormo's arm that thy ſighs ariſe? I begin, my father, to feel the ſtrength of my arm; I have drawn the ſword of my youth; and I have bent the bow. Let me meet this Rothmar, with the youths of Croma: let me meet him, O my father; for I feel my burning ſoul.</p>
            <p>AND thou ſhalt meet him, I ſaid, ſon of the ſightleſs Crothar! But let others advance before thee, that I may hear the tread of thy feet at thy return; for my eyes behold thee not, fair-haired Fovar-gormo!—He went, he met the foe; he fell. The foe advances towards Croma. He who ſlew my ſon is near, with all his pointed ſpears.</p>
            <p>IT is not time to fill the ſhell, I replied, and took my ſpear. My people ſaw the fire of my eyes, and they roſe around. All night we

ſtrode along the heath. Gray morning roſe in the eaſt. A green narrow vale appeared before us; nor did it want its blue ſtream. The dark hoſt of Rothmar are on its banks, with all their glittering arms. We fought along the vale; they fled; Rothmar ſunk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath my ſword. Day had not deſcended in the weſt when I brought his arms to Crothar. The aged hero felt them with his hands; and joy brightened in his ſoul.</p>
            <p>THE people gather to the hall; the ſhells of the feaſt are heard. Ten harps are ſtrung; five bards advance, and ſing, by turns,<note n="*" place="bottom">Thoſe extempore compoſitions were in great repute among ſucceeding bards. The pieces extant of that kind ſhew more of the good ear, than of the poetical genius of their authors. The tranſlator has only met with one poem of this ſort, which he thinks worthy of being preſerved. It is a thouſand years later than Oſſian, but the authors ſeem to have obſerved his manner, and adopted ſome of his expreſſions. The ſtory of it is this. Five bards, paſſing the night in the houſe of a chief, who was a poet himſelf, went ſeverally to make their obſervations on, and returned with an extempore deſcription of, night. The night happened to be one in October, as appears from the poem, and in the north of Scotland, it has all that variety which the bards aſcribe to it, in their deſcriptions.

                        <p>NIGHT is dull and dark. The clouds reſt on the hills. No ſtar with green trembling beam; no moon looks from the ſky. I hear the blaſt in the wood; but I hear it diſtant ſar. The ſtream of the valley murmurs; but its murmur is fullen and ſad. From the tree at the grave of the dead the long-howling owl is heard. I ſee a dim form on the plain!—It is a ghoſt!—it fades—it flies. Some funeral ſhall paſs this way: the meteor marks the path.</p>
                        <p>The diſtant dog is howling from the hut of the hill. The ſtag lies on the mountain moſs: the hind is at his ſide. She hears the wind in his branchy horns. She ſtarts, but lies again.</p>
                        <p>The roe is in the cleft of the rock; the heath-cock's head is beneath his wing. No beaſt, no bird is abroad, but the owl and the howling fox. She on a leafleſs tree: he in a cloud on the hill.</p>
                        <p>Dark, panting, trembling, ſad the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller has loſt his way. Through ſhrubs, through thorns, he goes, along the gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling rill. He fears the rock and the fen. He fears the ghoſt of night. The old tree groans to the blaſt; the falling branch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounds. The wind drives the withered burs, clung together, along the graſs. It is the light tread of a ghoſt!—He trembles amidſt the night.</p>
                        <p>Dark, duſky, howling is night, cloudy, windy, and full of ghoſts! The dead are abroad! my friends, receive me from the night.</p>

                        <p>The wind is up. The ſhower deſcends. The ſpirit of the mountain ſhrieks. Woods fall from high. Windows flap. The grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing river roars. The traveller attempts the ford. Hark that ſhriek! he dies:—The ſtorm drives the horſe from the hill, the goat, the lowing cow. They tremble as drives the ſhower, beſide the moulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bank.</p>
                        <p>The hunter ſtarts from ſleep, in his lonely hut; he wakes the fire decayed. His wet dogs ſmoke around him. He fills the chinks with heath. Loud roar two moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtreams which meet beſide his booth.</p>
                        <p>Sad on the ſide of a hill the wandering ſhepherd ſits. The tree reſounds above him. The ſtream roars down the rock. He waits for the riſing moon to guide him to his home.</p>
                        <p>Ghoſts ride on the ſtorm to-night. Sweet is their voice between the ſqualls of wind. Their ſongs are of other worlds.</p>
                        <p>The rain is paſt. The dry wind blows. Streams roar, and windows flap. Cold drops fall from the roof. I ſee the ſtarry ſky. But the ſhower gathers again. The weſt is gloomy and dark. Night is ſtormy and diſmal; receive me, my friends, from night.</p>

The clouds, divided, fly over the ſky, and ſhew the burning ſtars. The meteor, token of death! flies ſparkling through the gloom. It reſts on the hill. I ſee the withered fern, the dark browed rock, the fallen oak. Who is that in his ſhrowd beneath the tree, by the ſtream?</p>
                        <p>The waves dark-tumble on the lake, and laſh its rocky ſides. The boat is brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the cove; the oars on the rocking tide. A maid ſits ſad beſide the rock, and eyes the rolling ſtream. Her lover pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to come. She ſaw his boat, when yet it was light, on the lake. Is this his broken boat on the ſhore? Are theſe his groans on the wind?</p>
                        <p>Hark! the hail rattles around. The flaky ſnow deſcends. The tops of the hills are white. The ſtormy winds abate. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious is the night and cold; receive me, my friends, from night.</p>

                        <p>I ſee the trees overturned; the ſhocks of corn on the plain. The wakeful hind rebuilds the ſhocks, and whiſtles on the diſtant field.</p>
                        <p>Calm, ſettled, fair is night!—Who comes from the place of the dead? That form with the robe of ſnow; white arms and dark-brown hair! It is the daughter of the chief of the people; ſhe that lately fell! Come, let us view thee, O maid! thou that haſt been the delight of heroes! The blaſt drives the phantom away; white, without form, it aſcends the hill.</p>
                        <p>The breezes drive the blue miſt, ſlowly over the narrow vale. It riſes on the hill, and joins its head to heaven.—Night is ſettled, calm, blue, ſtarry, bright with the moon. Receive me not, my friends, for lovely is the night.</p>

The torrent murmurs on the rock. The cock is heard from the booth. More than half the night is paſt. The houſe-wiſe, groping in the gloom, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindles the ſettled fire. The hunter thinks that day approaches, and calls his bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dogs. He aſcends the hill and whiſtles on his way. A blaſt removes the cloud. He ſees the ſtarry plough of the north. Much of the night is to paſs. He nods by the moſſy rock.</p>
                        <p>Hark! the whirlwind is in the wood! A low murmur in the vale! It is the mighty army of the dead returning from the air.</p>
                        <p>The moon reſts behind the hill. The beam is ſtill on that lofty rock. Long are the ſhadows of the trees. Now it is dark over all. Night is dreary, ſilent, and dark; receive me, my friends, from night.</p>

Night flies before the beam, when it is poured on the hill. The young day returns from his clouds but we return no more.</p>

            <head>BERRATHON: A POEM<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>This poem is reputed to have been compoſed by Oſſian, a little time before his death; and conſequently it is known in tradition by no other name than <hi>Oſſian's laſt hymn.</hi> The tranſlator has taken the liberty to call it <hi>Berrathon,</hi> from the epiſode concerning the re-eſtabliſhment of Larth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor king of that iſland, after he had been dethroned by his own ſon Uthal. Fingal in his voyage to Lochlin [Fing. B. III.] whither he had been invited by Starno the father of Agandecca, ſo often mentioned in Oſſian's poems, touched at Berrathon, an iſland of Scandinavia, where he was kindly entertained by Larthmor the petty king of the place, who was a vaſſal of the ſupreme kings of Lochlin. The hoſpitality of Larth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor gained him Fingal's friendſhip, which that hero manifeſted, after the impriſonment of Larthmor by his own ſon, by ſending Oſſian and Toſcar, the father of Malvina ſo often mentioned, to reſcue Larthmor, and to puniſh the unnatural behaviour of Uthal. Uthal was handſome to a proverb, and conſequently much admired by the ladies. Nina-thoma the beautiful daughter of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thóma, a neighbouring prince, fell in love and fled with him. He proved unconſtant; for another lady, whoſe name is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, gaining his affections, he confined Nina-thoma to a deſart iſland near the coaſt of Berrathon. She was relieved by Oſſian, who, in company with Toſcar, landing on Berrathon, defeated the forces of Uthal, and killed him in a ſingle combat. Nina-thoma, whoſe love not all the bad behaviour of Uthal could eraſe, hearing of his death, died of grief. In the mean time Larthmor is reſtored, and Oſſian and Toſcar returned in triumph to Fingal.</p>
                  <p>The preſent poem opens with an elegy on the death of Malvina the daughter of Toſcar, and cloſes with preſages of the poet's death. It is almoſt altogether in a lyric meaſure, and has that melancholy air which diſtinguiſhes the remains of the works of Oſſian. If ever he compoſed any thing of a merry turn it is long ſince loſt. The ſerious and melancholy make the moſt laſting impreſſions on the human mind, and bid faireſt for being tranſmitted from generation to generation by tradition. Nor is it probable that Oſſian dea't much in chearful compoſition.

            <p>THE king of Morven commanded, and I raiſed my ſails to the wind. Toſcar chief of Lutha ſtood at my ſide, as I roſe on the dark-blue wave. Our courſe was to ſea-ſurrounded Berrathon<note n="†" place="bottom">Barrathón, <hi>a promontory in the midſt of waves.</hi> The poet gives it the epithet of ſea-ſurrounded, to prevent its being taken for a peninſula in the literal ſenſe.</note>, the iſle of many ſtorms. There dwelt, with his locks of age, the ſtately ſtrength of Larthmor. Larthmor who ſpread the feaſt of ſhells to Comhal's mighty ſon, when he went to Starno's halls, in the days of Agandecca. But when the chief was old, the pride of his ſon aroſe, the pride of fair-haired Uthal, the love of a thouſand maids. He bound the aged Larthmor, and dwelt in his ſounding halls.</p>
            <p>LONG pined the king in his cave, beſide his rolling ſea. Day did not come to his dwelling; nor the burning oak by night. But the wind of ocean was there, and the parting beam of the moon. The red ſtar looked on the king, when it trembled on the weſtern wave. Snitho came to Selma's hall: Snitho companion of Larthmor's youth. He told of the king of Berrathon: the wrath of Fingal roſe. Thrice he aſſumed the ſpear, reſolved to ſtretch his hand to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0509500400:290"/>
Uthal. But the memory<note n="*" place="bottom">The meaning of the poet is, that Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal remembered his own great actions, and conſequently would not fully them by engaging in a petty war againſt Uthal, who was ſo far his inferior in valour and power.</note> of his actions roſe before the king, and he ſent his ſon and Toſcar. Our joy was great on the rolling ſea; and we often half-unſheathed our ſwords<note n="†" place="bottom">The impatience of a young warrior, going on their firſt expedition, is well marked by their half-drawing their ſwords. The modeſty of Oſſian, in his narration of a ſtory which does him ſo much honour, is remarkable; and his humanity to Nina-thoma would grace a hero of our own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed age. Though Oſſian paſſes over his own actions in ſilence, or ſlightly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions them; tradition has done ample ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to his martial fame, and perhaps has exaggerated the actions of the poet beyond the bounds of credibility.</note>. For never before had we fought alone, in the battles of the ſpear. Night came down on the ocean; the winds departed on their wings. Cold and pale is the moon. The red ſtars lift their heads. Our courſe is ſlow along the coaſt of Berrathon; the white waves tumble on the rocks.</p>
            <p>WHAT voice is that, ſaid Toſcar, which comes between the ſounds of the waves? It is ſoft but mournſul, like the voice of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted bards. But I behold the maid<note n="‡" place="bottom">Nina-thoma the daughter of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thóma, who had been confined to a deſart iſland by her lover Uthal.</note>, ſhe ſits on the rock alone. Her head bends on her arm of ſnow: her dark hair is in the wind. Hear, ſon of Fingal, her ſong, it is ſmooth as the gliding waters of Lavath.—We came to the ſilent bay, and heard the maid of night.</p>
            <p>How long will ye roll around me, blue-tumbling waters of ocean? My dwelling was not always in caves, nor beneath the whiſtling tree. The feaſt was ſpread in Torthóma's hall; my father delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my voice. The youths beheld me in the ſteps of my loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and they bleſſed the dark-haired Nina-thoma. It was then thou didſt come, O Uthal! like the ſun of heaven. The ſouls of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0509500400:291"/>
the virgins are thine, ſon of generous Larthmor! But why doſt thou leave me alone in the midſt of roaring waters. Was my ſoul dark with thy death? Did my white hand lift the ſword? Why then haſt thou left me alone, king of high Finthormo<note n="*" place="bottom">Finthormo, the palace of Uthal. The names in this epiſode are not of a Celtic original; which makes it probable that Oſſian ſounds his poem on a true ſtory.</note>!</p>
            <p>THE tear ſtarted from my eye, when I heard the voice of the maid. I ſtood before her in my arms, and ſpoke the words of peace.—Lovely dweller of the cave, what ſigh is in that breaſt? Shall Oſſian lift his ſword in thy preſence, the deſtruction of thy foes?—Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Torthóma, riſe, I have heard the words of thy grief. The race of Morven are around thee, who never injured the weak. Come to our dark-boſomed ſhip, thou brighter than that ſetting moon. Our courſe is to the rocky Berrathon, to the ecchoing walls of Finthormo.—She came in her beauty, ſhe came with all her lovely ſteps. Silent joy brightened in her face, as when the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows fly from the field of ſpring; the blue-ſtream is rolling in brightneſs, and the green buſh bends over its courſe.</p>
            <p>THE morning roſe with its beams. We came to Rothma's bay. A boar ruſhed from the wood; my ſpear pierced his ſide. I rejoiced over the blood<note n="†" place="bottom">Oſſian thought that his killing the boar, on his firſt landing in Berrathon, was a good omen of his future ſucceſs in that iſland. The preſent highlanders look, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſuperſtition, upon the ſucceſs of their firſt action, after they have engaged in any deſperate undertaking.</note>, and foreſaw my growing fame.—But now the ſound of Uthal's train came from the high Fin-thormo; they ſpread over the heath to the chance of the boar. Himſelf comes ſlowly on, in the pride of his ſtrength. He lifts two pointed ſpears. On his ſide is the hero's ſword. Three youths carry his poliſhed

bows: the bounding of five dogs is before him. His heroes move on, at a diſtance, admiring the ſteps of the king. Stately was the ſon of Larthmor! but his ſoul was dark. Dark as the troubled face of the moon, when it foretels the ſtorms.</p>
            <p>WE roſe on the heath before the king; he ſtopt in the midſt of his courſe. His heroes gathered around, and a gray-haired bard ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced. Whence are the ſons of the ſtrangers! begun the bard of the ſong; the children of the unhappy come to Berrathon; to the ſword of car-borne Uthal. He ſpreads no feaſt in his hall: the blood of ſtrangers is on his ſtreams. If from Selma's walls ye come, from the moſſy walls of Fingal, chuſe three youths to go to your king to tell of the fall of his people. Perhaps the hero may come and pour his blood on Uthal's ſword; ſo ſhall the fame of Finthormo ariſe, like the growing tree of the vale.</p>
            <p>NEVER will it riſe, O bard, I ſaid in the pride of my wrath. He would ſhrink in the preſence of Fingal, whoſe eyes are the flames of death. The ſon of Comhal comes, and the kings vaniſh in his preſence; they are rolled together, like miſt, by the breath of his rage. Shall three tell to Fingal, that his people fell? Yes!—they may tell it, bard! but his people ſhall fall with fame.</p>
            <p>I STOOD in the darkneſs of my ſtrength; Toſcar drew his ſword at my ſide. The foe came on like a ſtream: the mingled ſound of death aroſe. Man took man, ſhield met ſhield; ſteel mixed its beams with ſteel.—Darts hiſs through air; ſpears ring on mails; and ſwords on broken bucklers bound. As the noiſe of an aged grove beneath the roaring wind, when a thouſand ghoſts break the trees by night, ſuch was the din of arms.—But Uthal fell beneath my ſword; and the ſons of Berrathon fled.—It was then I ſaw him in

Thou art fallen on thy plains, and the field is bare. The winds come from the deſart, and there is no ſound in thy leaves! Lovely art thou in death, ſon of car-borne Larthmor.</p>
            <p>NINA-THOMA ſat on the ſhore, and heard the ſound of battle. She turned her red eyes on Lethmal the gray-haired bard of Selma, for he had remained on the coaſt, with the daughter of Torthóma. Son of the times of old! ſhe ſaid, I hear the noiſe of death. Thy friends have met with Uthal and the chief is low! O that I had remained on the rock, incloſed with the tumbling waves! Then would my ſoul be ſad, but his death would not reach my ear. Art thou fallen on thy heath, O ſon of high Finthormo! thou didſt leave me on a rock, but my ſoul was full of thee. Son of high Finthormo! art thou fallen on thy heath?</p>
            <p>SHE roſe pale in her tears, and ſaw the bloody ſhield of Uthal; ſhe ſaw it in Oſſian's hand; her ſteps were diſtracted on the heath. She flew; ſhe found him; ſhe fell. Her ſoul came forth in a ſigh. Her hair is ſpread on his face. My burſting tears deſcend. A tomb aroſe on the unhappy; and my ſong was heard.</p>

REST, hapleſs children of youth! and the noiſe of that moſſy ſtream. The virgins will ſee your tomb, at the chace, and turn away their weeping eyes. Your fame will be in the ſong; the voice of the harp will be heard in your praiſe. The daughters of Selma ſhall hear it; and your renown ſhall be in other lands.—Reſt, children of youth, at the noiſe of the moſſy ſtream.</p>
            <p>Two days we remained on the coaſt. The heroes of Berrathon convened. We brought Larthmor to his halls; the feaſt of ſhells is ſpread.—The joy of the aged was great; he looked to the arms of his fathers; the arms which he left in his hall, when the pride of Uthal aroſe—We were renowned before Larthmor, and he bleſſed the chiefs of Morven; but he knew not that his ſon was low, the ſtately ſtrength of Uthal. They had told, that he had retired to the woods, with the tears of grief; they had told it, but he was ſilent in the tomb of Rothma's heath.</p>
            <p>ON the fourth day we raiſed our ſails to the roar of the northern wind. Larthmor came to the coaſt, and his bards raiſed the ſong. The joy of the king was great, he looked to Rothma's gloomy heath; he ſaw the tomb of his ſon; and the memory of Uthal roſe.—Who of my heroes, he ſaid, lies there: he ſeems to have been of the kings of ſpears? Was he renowned in my halls, before the pride of Uthal roſe?</p>
            <p>YE are ſilent, ye ſons of Berrathon, is the king of heroes low?—My heart melts for thee, O Uthal; though thy hand was againſt thy father.—O that I had remained in the cave! that my ſon had dwelt in Finthormo!—I might have heard the tread of his feet, when he went to the chace of the boar.—I might have heard

his voice on the blaſt of my cave. Then would my ſoul be glad: but now darkneſs dwells in my halls.</p>
            <p>SUCH were my deeds, ſon of Alpin, when the arm of my youth was ſtrong; ſuch were<note n="*" place="bottom">Oſſian ſpeaks.</note> the actions of Toſcar, the car-borne ſon of Conloch. But Toſcar is on his flying cloud; and I am alone at Lutha: my voice is like the laſt ſound of the wind, when it forſakes the woods. But Oſſian ſhall not be long alone, he ſees the miſt that ſhall receive his ghoſt. He beholds the miſt that ſhall ſorm his robe, when he appears on his hills. The ſons of little men ſhall behold me, and admire the ſtature of the chiefs of old. They ſhall creep to their caves, and look to the ſky with fear; for my ſteps ſhall be in the clouds, and darkneſs ſhall roll on my ſide.</p>
            <p>LEAD, ſon of Alpin, lead the aged to his woods. The winds begin to riſe. The dark wave of the lake reſounds. Bends there not a tree from Mora with its branches bare? It bends, ſon of Alpin, in the ruſtling blaſt. My harp hangs on a blaſted branch. The ſound of its ſtrings is mournful.—Does the wind touch thee, O harp, or is it ſome paſſing ghoſt!—It is the hand of Malvina! but bring me the harp, ſon of Alpin; another ſong ſhall riſe. My ſoul ſhall depart in the ſound; my fathers ſhall hear it in their airy hall.—Their dim faces ſhall hang, with joy, from their clouds; and their hands receive their ſon.</p>

                  <p>This magnificent deſcription of the power of Fingal over the winds and ſtorms, and the image of his taking the ſun, and hiding him in the clouds, do not correſpond with the preceding paragraph, where he is repreſented as a feeble ghoſt, and no more the TERROR OF THE VA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIANT; but it agrees with the notion of the times concerning the ſouls of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, who, it was ſuppoſed, had the command of the winds and ſtorms, but tock no concern in the affairs of men.</p>
                  <p>It was the immoderate praiſe beſtowed by the poets on their departed friends, that gave the firſt hint to ſuperſtition to deify the deceaſed heroes; and thoſe new divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities owed all their attributes to the fancy of the bard who ſung their elegies.</p>
                  <p>We do not find, that the praiſes of Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal had this effect upon his countrymen; but that is to be imputed to the idea they had of power, which they always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with bodily ſtrength and perſonal valour, both which were diſſolved by death.</p>

BUT there is a murmur in the heath! the ſtormy winds abate! I hear the voice of Fingal. Long has it been abſent from mine ear!—Come, Oſſian, come away, he ſays: Fingal has received his fame. We paſſed away, like flames that had ſhone for a ſeaſon, our departure was in renown. Though the plains of our battles are dark and ſilent; our fame is in the four gray ſtones. The voice of Oſſian has been heard; and the harp was ſtrung in Selma.—Come Oſſian, come away, he ſays, and fly with thy fathers on clouds.</p>

DID thy beauty laſt, O Ryno<note n="*" place="bottom">Ryno, the ſon of Fingal, who was kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Ireland, in the war againſt Swaran, [Fing. b. 5.] was remarkable for the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his perſon, his ſwiftneſs and great exploits. Minvane, the daughter of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, and ſiſter to Gaul ſo often mentioned in Oſſian's compoſitions, was in love with Ryno.—Her lamentation over her lover is introduced as an epiſode in one of Oſſian's great poems. The lamentation is the only part of the poem now extant, and as it has ſome poetical merit, I have ſubjoined it to this note. The poet repreſents Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vane as ſeeing, from one of the rocks of Morven, the fleet of Fingal returning from Ireland.
<q rend="inline">
                     <p>SHE bluſhing ſad, from Morven's rocks, bends over the darkly-rolling ſea. She ſaw the youths in all their arms.—Where, Ryno, where art thou?</p>
                     <p>Our dark looks told that he was low!—That pale the hero flew on clouds! That in the graſs of Morven's hills, his feeble voice was heard in wind!</p>
                     <p>And is the ſon of Fingal fallen, on Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin's moſſy plains? Strong was the arm that conquered him!—Ah me! I am alone.</p>
                     <p>Alone I will not be, ye winds! that lift my dark-brown hair. My ſighs will not long mix with your ſtream; for I muſt ſleep with Ryno.</p>
                     <p>I ſee thee not with beauty's ſteps return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the chace.—The night is round Minaven's love; and ſilence dwells with Ryno.</p>
                     <p>Where are thy dogs, and where thy bow? Thy ſhield that was ſo ſtrong? Thy ſword like heaven's deſcending fire? The bloody ſpear of Ryno?</p>
                     <p>I ſee them mixed in thy ſhip; I ſee them ſtained with blood.—No arms are in thy narrow hall, O darkly-dwelling Ryno!</p>
                     <p>When will the morning come, and ſay, ariſe, thou king of ſpears! ariſe, the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are abroad. The hinds are near thee, Ryno!</p>
                     <p>Away, thou fair-haired morning, away! the ſlumbering king hears thee not! The hinds bound over his narrow tomb; for death dwells round young Ryno.</p>
                     <p>But I will tread ſoftly, my king! and ſteal to the bed of thy repoſe. Minvane will lie in ſilence, near her ſlumbering Ryno.</p>
                     <p>The maids ſhall ſeek me; but they ſhall not find me: they ſhall follow my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with ſongs. But I will not hear you, O maids: I ſleep with fair-haired Ryno.</p>
                  </q>
               </note>? Stood the ſtrength of car-borne Oſcar? Fingal himſelf paſſed away; and the halls of his fathers forgot his ſteps.—And ſhalt thou remain, aged bard! when the mighty have failed?—But my fame ſhall remain, and grow like the oak of Morven; which lifts its broad head to the ſtorm, and rejoices in the courſe of the wind.</p>
