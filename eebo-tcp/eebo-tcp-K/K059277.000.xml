            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE<note n="*" place="bottom">The Rights of Infants was wrote in the latter end of the year 1796, but Paine's Agrarian Juſtice coming to hand before it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, the following Strictures, by way of Preface and Appendix, were added.</note>
            </head>
            <p>AT laſt Mr. Paine has thought fit to own, with the Pſalmiſt, and with Mr. Locke, that <q>
                  <hi>God hath given the earth to the children of men, given it to mankind in common</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is a truth ſo indiſputable, and which I always thought of ſuch vaſt importance for mankind univerſally to underſtand and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that I have indefatigably embraced every opportunity, from my youth up, to publiſh it, together with the moſt conſiſtent plan that I could form thereon.</p>
            <p>I am glad that Mr. Paine has, even though late, made this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, becauſe his celebrity will procure him many readers, and greatly add both to the inveſtigation of this great fundamental truth, and of ſuch philoſophical ſuperſtructures as may be built on the ſame. But as to the plan that lie has laid down in his AGRARIAN JUSTICE (where he firſt acknowledges this principle) it does not appear to me to be in any meaſure juſt or ſatisfactory. The principle is without doubt incomparably grand, and the very firſt maxim in the law of nature, and in the ſcience of right and wrong, and is fraught with all the bleſſings that can render mankind happy on earth. But, O dire diſappointment! Behold! Mr. Paine, inſtead of erecting on this rock of ages an everlaſting Temple of Juſtice, has erected an execrable fabric of compromiſſory expediency, as if in good earneſt intended for a Swiniſh Multitude.</p>
            <p>The poor, beggarly ſlipends which he would have us to accept of in lieu of our lordly and juſt pretenſions to the ſoil of our birth, are ſo contemptible and inſulting, that I ſhall leave them to the ſcorn of every perſon conſcious of the dignity of his nature, not detaining the reader from the peruſal of the following little tract on the Rights of Infants, where men who dare contemplate their rights, may ſee them pourtrayed boldly at full length.</p>
            <p>The more I contemplate human affairs, the more I am convinced that a landed intereſt is incompatible with the happineſs and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the world. For as all the rivers run into the ſea, and yet the ſea is not full, ſo let there be ever ſo many ſources of wealth, let trade, foreign and domeſtic, open all their fluices, yet will no other but the landed intereſt he ultimately the better.</p>
            <p>In whatever line of buſineſs, or in whatever ſituation the public obſerve men thrive, thither every one preſſes, and in competition bid over each other's head for the houſes and ſhops on the lucky ſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1230001500:4"/>thereby raiſing the rents till the landlord gets the whole fat of their labours. It is the ſame in reſpect to the farms; for if a profitable market, foreign or domeſtic, ſpring up for the produce of the earth, then farming will be the rage, and every one will over bid another for farms, till they can hardly live by them. Nay, even aboliſh the tythes, and the rents of the farms will immediately ſo advance that the whole advantage ſhall center in the landlords.</p>
            <p>Thus all things work togethe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for good to thoſe who love God, which ſeems to be fully accompliſhed in the landed intereſt, who are the viſible elect. Yes, for theirs are all things whether the ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, the government or the dignities; the principalities, or the powers. All dominion is rooted and grounded in land, and thence ſpring every kind of lordſhip which overtops and choaks all the ſhrubs and flowers of the foreſt. But take away thoſe tall, thoſe overbearing ariflocratic trees, and then the lowly plants of the ſoil will have air, will thrive and grow robuſt. Nevertheleſs, take care you leave not any roots of thoſe lordly plants in the earth, for though cut down to the ſlump like Nebuchaduezzar, yet if any veſtage of the ſyſtem remain, any fibre of the accurſed roots, though ever ſo ſmall lie concealed in the ſoil, they would ſprout again and ſoon recover their priſtine vigour, to the overſhadowing and deſtruction of all the undergrowth. Thus do philoſophy and the pureſt philanthropy compel us to cradicate this baneful order from human ſociety.</p>
            <p>Whether my plan of enjoying man's rights, which I have been publiſhing in different ways for more than twenty years, be objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable or no, it is certain it has never been anſwered; neither have I ſeen or heard of any arguments on the ſubject, but what have only more effectually convinced me that no ſyſtem can be more univerſally juſt even to thoſe it ſeems moſt to militate againſt; more eaſily eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, becauſe it is the intereſt of every one not to oppoſe it; nor of courſe more likely afterwards to be more peaceful and permanent.</p>
            <p>If I am wrong, let me be confuted; and if I am not, let mankind for their own ſakes, pay attention to what I ſay. They ought at leaſt to give me credit for my diſintereſtedneſs in this ſcheme, for according to it I can have no private landed eſtate, no tenants to work for me, nor claim any privilege above my fellow-citizens. Wherefore, before any be ſo ungenerous as to condemn me as preſumptuous, I hope they will candidly weigh my ſeveral arguments which they will find in the various little things I have publiſhed, which are neither many nor dear, and in the following Rights of Infants.</p>

               <p>Aſk the ſhe-bears, and every ſhe-monſter, and they will tell you what the rights of every ſpecies of young are.—They will tell you, in reſolute language and actions too, that their rights extend to a full participation of the fruits of the earth. They will tell you, and vindicate it likewiſe by deeds, that mothers have a right, at the peril of all oppoſers, to provide from the elements the proper nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments of their young. And ſeeing this, ſhall we be aſked what the Rights of Infants are? As if they had no rights? As if they were excreſcences and abortions of nature? As if they had not a right to the milk of our breaſts? Nor we a right to any food to make milk of? As if they had not a right to good nurſing, to cleanlineſs, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable cloathing and lodging? Villains! Why do you aſk that ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating queſtion? Have not the ſoxes holes, and the birds of the air neſts, and ſhall the children of men have not where to lay their heads? Have brute-mothers a right to eat graſs, and the food they like beſt, to engender milk in their dugs, for the nouriſhment of their young, and ſhall the mothers of infants be denied ſuch a right? Is not this earth our common alſo, as well as it is the common of brutes? May we not eat herbs, berries, or nuts as well as other creatures? Have we not a right to hunt and prowl for prey with ſhe-wolves? And have we not a right to fiſh with ſhe-otters? Or may we not dig coals or cut wood for fuel? Nay, does nature provide a luxuriant and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant feaſt for all her numerous tribes of animals except us? As if ſorrow were our portion alone, and as if we and our helpleſs babes came into this world only to weep over each other?</p>

               <p>Yes, Molochs! Our ſex were defenders of rights from the beginning. And though men, like other he-brutes, ſink calmly into apathy reſpecting their offspring, you ſhall find nature, as it never was, ſo it never ſhall be extinguiſhed in us. You ſhall find that we not only know our rights, but have ſpirit to aſſert them, to the downfal of you and all tyrants. And ſince it is ſo that the men, like he-aſſes, ſuffer themſelves to be laden with as many pair of panyers of rents, tithes, &amp;c. as your <hi>tender</hi> conſciences pleaſe to lay upon them, we, even we, the females, will vindicate the rights of the ſpecies, and throw you and all your panyers in the dirt.</p>

               <p>No, Sophiſts, we do not want to be as Indians. But the natural fruits of the earth being the fruits of our undoubted common, we have an indefenſible right to, and we will no longer be deprived of them, without an equivalent.</p>

               <p>Sure, woman, you do not expect the fruits of men's labours and ingenuity for nothing! Do not the farmers, in the firſt place, pay very high rents for their farms; and, in the next place, are they not at great trouble and expence in tilling and manuring the ground, and in breeding cattle; and ſurely you cannot expect that there men will work and toil, and lay out their money for you, for nothing.</p>

               <p>And pray, ladies and gentlemen, who ever dreamt of hurting the farmers, or taking their proviſions for nothing, except yourſelves? It is only the privileged orders, and their humble imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators on the highway, who have the impudence to deprive men of their labours for nothing. No; if it pleaſe your nobleneſſes and gentleneſſes, it is you, and not the farmers, that we have to reckon with. And pray now, your highneſſes, who is it that receive thoſe rents which you ſpeak of from the farmers?</p>

               <p>Well confeſſed, villains! Now out of your own mouths will I condemn you, you wicked Molocks! And ſo you have the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1230001500:7"/>to own yourſelves the curſed brood of ruſſians, who by ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and oppreſſion, uſurped the lordſhip and dominion of the earth, to the excluſion and ſtarvation of weeping infants and their poor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Or, at the beſt, the purchaſers of thoſe ill-got domains? O worſe than Molochs! now let the blood of the millions of innocent babes who have periſhed through your vile uſurpations be upon your murderous heads! You have deprived the mothers of nature's gifts, and farmed them out to farmers, and pocketied the money, as you audaciouſly confeſs. Yes, villains! you have treaſured up the tears and groans of dumb, helpleſs, periſhing, dying infants. O, you bloody landed intereſt! you band of robbers! Why do you call your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ladies and gentlemen? Why do you aſſume ſoft names, you beaſts of prey? Too well do your emblazoned arms and eſcutcheons witneſs the ferocity of your bloody and barbarous origin! But ſoon ſhall thoſe audacious Gothic emblems of rapine ceaſe to offend the eyes of an enlightened people, and no more make an odious diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the ſpoilers and the ſpoiled. But, ladies and gentlemen, is it neceſſary, in order that we eat bread and mutton; that the rents ſhould be received by you? Might not the farmers as well pay their rents to us, who are the natural and rightful proprietors? If, for the ſake of cultivation, we are content to give up to farmers our wild fruits, our hunting grounds, our fiſh and game; our coal-mines, and our fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, is it not equitable that we ſhould have the rents in lieu thereof? If not, how can the farmers have the face to ſell us again the produce of our own land?</p>
               <p>Hear me! ye oppreſſors! ye who live ſumptuouſly every day! ye, for whom the ſun ſeems to ſhine, and the ſeaſons change, ye for whom alone all human and brute creatures toil, ſighing, but in vain, for the crumbs which fall from your overcharged tables; ye, for whom alone the heavens drop fatneſs, and the earth yields her encreaſe; hearken to me, I ſay, ye who are not ſatisfied with uſurping all that nature can yield; ye, who are inſatiable as the grave; ye who would deprive every heart of joy but your own, I ſay hearken to me! Your horrid tyranny, your infanticide is at an end! Your grinding the faces of the poor, and your drinking the blood of infants, is at an end! The groans of the priſons, the groans of the camp, and the groans of the cottage, excited by your infernal policy, are at an end! And behold the whole earth breaks forth into ſinging at the new creation, at the breaking of the iron rod of ariſtocratic ſway, and at the riſing of the everlaſting ſun of righteouſneſs!</p>
               <p>And did you really think, my good gentlefolk, that you were the pillars that upheld the univerſe? Did you think that we would never have the wit to do without you? Did you conceive that we ſhould never be able to procure bread and beef, and fuel, without your agency? Ah! my dear creatures, the magic ſpell is broke. Your ſorceries, your witchcrafts, your prieſtcrafts, and all your juggling crafts, are at an end; and the Meridian Sun of Liberty burſts forth upon the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1230001500:8"/>world, diſpelling the accumulated miſts of dreary ages, and leaves us the glorious blue expanſe, of ſerene unclouded reaſon.</p>
               <p>Well then, ſince you have compelled, ſince you have driven us, through your cruel bondage, to emancipate ourſelves, we will even try to do without you, and deal with the honeſt farmers ourſelves, who will find no difference, unleſs for the better, between paying their rents to us and to you.</p>
               <p>And whereas we have found our huſbands, to their indelible ſhame, woefully negligent and deficient about their own rights, as well as thoſe of their wives and infants, we women, mean to take up the buſineſs ourſelves, and let us ſee if any of our huſbands dare hinder us. Wherefore, you will find the buſineſs much more ſeriouſly and effectually managed in our hands than over it has been yet. You may ſmile, tyrants, but you have juſter cauſe to weep. For, as nature has implanted into the breaſts of all mothers the moſt pure and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal concern for their young, which no bribes can buy, nor threats annihilate, be aſſured we will ſtand true to the intereſt of our babes, and ſhame, woe, and deſtruction be to the pitiful varlet that dare obſtruct us. For their ſakes we will no longer make brick without ſtraw, but will draw the produce of our eſtate. If we deprive our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of our common, in order that it may be cultivated, we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will have the price thereof, that we may buy therewith, as far as it will go, the farmer's produce. And ſo far as our reſpective ſhares of the rent may be inadequate to the comfortable and elegant ſupport of ourſelves and infants, ſo far will we chearfully, by our honeſt endeavours, in our ſeveral callings, make up the deficiency, and tender life worth enjoying. To labour for ourſelves and infants we do not decline; but we are ſick of labouring for an inſatiable ariſtocracy.</p>
               <p>To convince your highneſſes that our plan is well digeſted, I will lay it before you. You will find it very ſimple, but that is the ſign of the greater perfection. As I ſaid before, we women (becauſe the men are not to be depended on) will appoint, in every pariſh, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of our own ſex, (which we preſume our gallant lock-jawed ſpouſes and paramours will at leaſt, for their own intereſt, not oppoſe,) to receive the rents of the houſes and lands already tenanted, and alſo to let, to the beſt bidders, on ſeven years leaſes, ſuch farms and tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as may, from time to time, become vacant. Out of thoſe rents we can remit to government ſo much per pound, according to the exigencies of the ſtate, in lieu of all taxes; ſo that we may no longer have taxes nor tax-gatherers. Out of theſe rents we ſhall rent pay all our builders and workmen that build or repair our houſes; pave, cleanſe, or light our ſtreets; pay the ſalaries of our magiſtrates an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And whereas births and funerals, and conſequent ſickneſſes, are attended with expence, it ſeems requiſite to allow, at quarter-day, to the head of every family, a full ſhare for every child that may have been born in his houſe ſince the former quarter-day, though the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant may be then but a day old; and alſo, for every perſon who may have died ſince the former quarter-day, though the death ſhould have happened but a day after it.</p>
               <p>This ſurplus, which is to be dealt out again among the living ſouls in a pariſh every quarter-day, may be reaſonably ſuppoſed to amount to full two-thirds of the whole ſum of rents collected. But whatever it may amount to, ſuch ſhare of the ſurplus rents is the impreſcriptible right of every human being in civilized ſociety, as an equivalent for the natural materials of their common eſtate, which by letting to rent, for the ſake of cultivation and improvement, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, now ladies and gentlemen, you ſee the glorious work is done! and the rights of the human ſpecies built on ſo broad and ſolid a baſis, that all your malice will not be able to prevail againſt them! Moreover, when we begin with you, we will make a full end of your power at once. We will not impoliticly tamper with the lion, and pluck out a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No; we will begin where we mean to end, by depriving you inſtantaneouſly, as by an elective ſhock, of every ſpecies of revenue from lands, which will univerſally and at once, be given to the pariſhes, to be diſpoſed of by and for the uſe of the inhabitants, as ſaid before.</p>
               <p>But yet be not caſt down, my good ladies and gentlemen, all this is done for the ſake of ſyſtem, not revenge or retaliation; for we wiſh not to reduce you to beggary, as you do us, for we will leave you all your moveable riches and wealth, all your gold and ſilver, your rich clothes and furniture; your corn and cattle, and every thing that does not appertain to the land as a fixture, for theſe, you know, muſt come to the pariſh with our eſtates. So that you ſee you will ſtill be the richeſt part of the community, and may, by your chearful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence, be much more happy then you are now under the exiſting unjuſt ſyſtem of things. But if, by fooliſh and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>BUT ſtop, don't let us reckon without our hoſt; for Mr. Paine will object to ſuch and equal diſtribution of the rents. For ſays he, in his Agrarian Juſtice, the public can claim but a <hi>Tentk Part</hi> of the value of the landed property as it now exiſts, with its vaſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of cultivation and building. But why are we to be put off now with but a Tenth Share? Becauſe, ſays Mr. Paine, it has ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in the hands of private proprietors as to be of ten times the value it was of in its natural ſtate. But may we not aſk who improved the land? Did the proprietors alone work and toll at this improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And did we labourers and our forefathers ſtand, like Indians and Hottentots, idle, ſpectators of ſo much public-ſpirited induſtry? I ſuppoſe not. Nay, on the contrary, it is evident to the moſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial enquirer that the labouring claſſes ought principally to be thanked for every improvement.</p>
               <p>Indeed, if there had never any ſlave, any vaſſals, or any day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labourers employed in building and tillage, then the proprietors might have boaſted of having themſelves created all this gay ſcene of things. But the caſe alters amazingly, when we conſider that the earth has
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1230001500:16"/>been cultivated either by ſlaves, compelled, like beaſts, to labour, of by the indigent objects whom they firſt exclude from a ſhare in the ſoil, that want may compel them to ſell their labour for daily bread. In ſhort, the great may as well boaſt of fighting their battles as of cultivating the earth.</p>
               <p>The toil of the labouring claſſes firſt produces proviſions, and they the demand of their families creates a market for them. Therefore it will be found that it is the markets made by the labouring and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical tribes that have improved the earth. And once take away theſe markets, order all the labouring people, like the Iſraelites, leave the country in a body, and you would immediately ſee from what cauſe the country had been cultivated, and ſo many goodly towns and villages built.</p>
               <p>You may ſuppoſe that after the emigration of all theſe beggarly people, every thing would go on as well as before: that the farmer would continue to plough, and the town landlord to build as formerly. I tell you nay; for the farmer could neither proceed without labourers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>d purchaſers for his corn and cattle. It would be juſt the ſame with the building landlord, for he could neither procure workmen to build, nor tenants to pay him rent.</p>
               <p>Behold then your grand, voluptuous nobility and gentry, the arch cultivators of the earth, obliged, for lack of ſervants, again to turn Gothic hunters, like their lavage forefathers. Behold their palaces. temples, and towns, mouldering into duſt, and affording ſhelter only to wild beaſts; and their boaſted, cultivated fields and garden, dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated into a howling wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee that the conſumption created by the mouths, and the backs, of the poor deſpiſed multitude, contributes to the cultivation of the earth, as well as their hands. And it is alſo the rents that they pay that builds the towns, and not the racking building landlord. Therefore, let us not in weak commiſeration be biaſſed by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended philanthropy of the great, to the reſignation of our deareſt rights. And if our eſtates have improved in their hands, during their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
