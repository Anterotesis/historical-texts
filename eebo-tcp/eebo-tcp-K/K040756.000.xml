            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AMONG the many unpleaſing cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances attending the
concealed writer of a dramatic piece (and they are more than are apt at firſt
to occur to him), it is not one of the leaſt conſiderable to a liberal
mind, that other perſons become ſufferers by his failings. Thus while the
real Author, on one hand, has enjoyed the compliment of having the Lord of the
Manor aſcribed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral men, for whom it is great literary cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to be
miſtaken; ſo, on the other, he has had the pain to ſee criticiſm
extended from poetical to political principles, and made a vehicle for party
reflections upon perſons who never ſaw a line of his writing. Not only have
the erroneous gueſſes ſhifted from man to man, they have fallen alſo
upon men in a body: different ſcenes have been given to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent pens; and
ſometimes theſe ſuppoſed writers have multiplied upon the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
'till they became almoſt as numerous as the perſonages of the drama.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0163801400:3"/>Perhaps an apology may be due to every man who
has been charged with this found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and the more eſpecially as the parent
himſelf means to continue ſtill unknown—confeſſing ingenuouſly
at the ſame time, that his temptations to break from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment far
over-balance his diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for after duly weighing every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of
fable, conduct, dialogue, &amp;c. with which the ſevereſt critic could tax
him, what candidate for praiſe in poetry would not bear the weight ten-fold,
for the ſole pride of avowing in his own name the ſongs which by many
reſpectable judges have been attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Mr. SHERIDAN?</p>
            <p>It is unneceſſary to trouble the reader with the motives upon
which ſo flattering a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is reſiſted.—Some of them
perhaps are mere peculiarities of temper—Suffice it to ſay, that they
are ſuch, upon the whole, as induce this Author to requeſt the few friends,
who neceſſarily have been entruſted with his ſecret, not to think
themſelves at liberty, from any thing here ſaid, to divulge it. For his own
part he is deſirous ſo far to ſatisfy the public curioſity (if
curioſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains upon ſo trifling a ſubject) as to declare that every
word in the following Opera is the production of a ſingle perſon; and
ſhould a miſtake ſtill reſt upon any individual, it is
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0163801400:4"/> fit that the burthen ſhould be made as light as
poſſible, by removing ſome prejudices which have been bevelled unjuſtly
againſt the <hi>man,</hi> whatever may become of others which may have been
conceived againſt the <hi>piece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be it known, then, that theſe ſcenes were written laſt
ſummer in the country for mere amuſement—to relax a mind which had
been engaged in more intenſe application—and the only view in bringing
them upon the ſtage was a continuation of amuſement, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and
enhanced by the reflection, that, if they were defective in many parts, they
were harmleſs in all; that although they might not correct the follies, they
would not offend the morals of the ſpectators.</p>
            <p>It could not but be matter of ſurpriſe and ſome pain to a
writer intent upon theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to find himſelf accuſed of having
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced the character of Captain Trepan, for the purpoſe of impeding the
recruiting ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the army. To be thought a bad Poet, is but a common
misfortune, and it may be borne with temper and in ſilence; but the
imputation of being an ill-intention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed citizen requires an anſwer, though in
this caſe, it is truſted, a ſhort one will ſuffice.</p>
            <p>The writer has ever conceived, that as to ſhew the enormous
vices of the time in their <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0163801400:5"/> utmoſt deformity ought to be
the great end of dramatic ſatire; ſo, in a leſſer degree, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to ridicule any practice that ſavoured more of abuſe than abſolute vice,
had its uſe. They who think the fallacies and frauds of recruiting dealers
about this town neceſſary evils, which ought to be connived at, as
contributary to the military ſtrength of the nation, are ignorant of facts,
or blind to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. So little is the writer of that opinion, that he
has thought it incumbent upon him to reſtore in print the paſſages which
from apprehenſion of ſudden miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and from no other
apprehenſion, were omitted in the repreſentation. An abler hand might have
carried ſatire on this ſubject infinitely further, not only with a
conſciouſneſs of doing no harm, but alſo a confidence of doing good.
Let us ſuppoſe, for illuſtration-ſake, that his Majeſty were
pleaſed to command the Firſt Part of King Henry IV. and to order all the
boxes to be kept for the new Commanders, which the policy of the times (from
the ſcarcity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly of veterans) has placed at the head of corps
raiſing or to be raiſed; and one of the galleries devoted excluſively to
the Crimp Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and their Subalterns—might not public benefit be
united with entertainment by a juſt exhibition of old Jack Falſtaff's
levies? and <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0163801400:6"/> ſhould it happen that any perſon preſent
in ſuch an audience were conſcious of
<q rend="inline">"<hi>having miſuſed the King's preſs
damnably</hi>"</q>—or from any other cauſe were
<q rend="inline">"<hi>aſhamed of his
raga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muffins</hi>"</q>—ſurely he could not but feel grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for ſo
gentle a hint! and we might ſee effected by wit and mirth, a reformation,
which under a harſh Sovereign might have been thought deſerving of direct
and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary reprehenſion.</p>
            <p>A more ſerious defence can hardly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite upon this
ſubject, after publication of the piece. At the Theatre, where the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
naturally (and in this inſtance moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly) has reſted much upon
the muſic, the public ſentiments ſincerely meant to be inculcated may
have eſcaped notice; but, in the cloſet, the writer, without a ſhadow of
fear, reſts his juſtification from the charge of ill-will to the military
ſervice, upon paſſages too numerous to be pointed out. He might almoſt
ſay upon every character of the Drama—but particularly upon that of
Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, where the two extremes of that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which fills, or ought to
fill, every youthful breaſt, is employed to excite mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ardour: in one
inſtance, <hi>diſappointment</hi> and <hi>deſpondency</hi> in love are
made the motives for enliſting as a private ſoldier; in the other,
<hi>ſucceſs</hi> in love, the ſupreme happineſs <pb n="x" facs="tcp:0163801400:7"/> in
human exiſtence, is not admitted as an excuſe for relinquiſhing the
military ſervice during the exigencies of our country.</p>
            <p>To diſavow the aſperſion I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, was the
principal purpoſe of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the candour of the reader; but
hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken up the pen, I will venture to offer to his further indulgence a
few thoughts upon Opera, and particularly that ſpecies of it attempted in the
enſuing pages.</p>
            <p>The Opera is a favourite entertainment in all the polite countries
of Europe, but in none, that I know of, held ſubject to the laws of regular
Drama. There is neither uſage nor ſtatute of criticiſm (if I may uſe
that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) to try it by, unleſs we look for ſuch in ſome
muſical code. Metaſtaſio, though a very reſpectable ſtage writer, has
never been brought to the ſame bar with Corneille or Racine, or any other
profeſſors of correct Tragedy. The vital principle and very ſoul of
Italian Opera is muſic; and provided it be well maintained in compoſition
and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every inconſiſtency, in fable, conduct, or character, is
not only always pardoned, but often applauded.</p>
            <p>The French Opera (without entering into the diſputed points
concerning its muſic, or denying the many beautiful paſſages which may be
extracted from its poetry) is if poſſible <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0163801400:8"/> more abſurd
than the Italian in its departure from probability. To the powers of ſound is
added all that decoration, machinery, beauty, and grace, can ſupply to
enchant the eye and the fancy; and ſo forcible, it muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, is
their effect, that the judgement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives no ſhock, when tyrants and lovers,
heroes and peaſants, Gods and devils, are ſinging and dancing in amicable
chorus all together.</p>
            <p>The reader will go with me in applying every thing yet ſaid to
the ſerious or great Opera. Another ſpecies, but no more of the legitimate
family of Comedy than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is of Tragedy, has been introduced in all the
countries I have alluded to. In Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land both have been in uſe in our native
language, but with very different ſucceſs. I have no heſitation in
pronouncing an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the adopting what is called reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative into a
language, to which it is totally incongruous, is the cauſe of failure in an
Engliſh ſerious Opera much oftener than the want of muſical powers in the
performers. In countries where the inflection of voice in recitative upon the
ſtage is little more than what the ear is uſed to in common diſcourſe,
the dialogue of the drama is ſuſtained and ſtrengthened by a great
compaſs of tones; but in our northern climates, in proportion
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0163801400:9"/> as the ordinary expreſſion comes nearer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notony,
recitative, or muſical dialogue, will ſeem the more prepoſterous<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Addiſon upon this ſubject, Spectator N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 29,
and others of his papers upon the Opera.</note>.</p>
            <p>I will not contend (though I have my doubts) that it is
impoſſible for genius to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and for voice to deliver, a ſort of
reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative that the Engliſh language will bear. But it muſt be widely
different from the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian. If any ſpecimens can yet be produced of it's
having been effected, they will be found to conſiſt only of a few lines
introductive of the air which is to follow, and as ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the ear
juſt as ſymphony would be. Very few ſerious pieces, except Artaxerxes,
can be recollected upon our Theatre where it has not entirely failed, even when
aſſiſted by action: in Oratorios it is, with a few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and
thoſe ſuſtained by accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a ſoporific that even the thunder of
Handel's choruſſes are hardly loud enough to overcome.</p>
            <p>There may be enthuſiaſts in muſic who will treat the
diſreliſh I have deſcribed to want of ear. Let ear be underſtood merely
as the organ by which the mind is to receive more or leſs delight from
ſublime Engliſh verſe, and I ſhould be happy to ſee the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
brought to public iſſue—the teſt ſhould be the performance of
Alexander's Feaſt as <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0163801400:10"/> now ſet to muſic throughout;
and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that inimitable ode, with the ſongs alone preſerved
in muſic, and the reſt delivered by Mrs. Yates without accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niment, or
other melody, than her empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic elocution.</p>
            <p>I truſt that in contending againſt muſical dialogue in
Engliſh, I ſhall not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to think that all muſic is
inapplicable to the higher compoſitions of our ſtage. On the contrary I am
convinced that under judicious management muſic is capable of giving them
effect beyond what our beſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors can attain without it—muſic can
add energy to Shakſpeare himſelf. Indignant as an Engliſh audience would
be to hear King Lear deliver himſelf in recitative, I believe no perſon,
who had a heart or taſte, ever contemplated the mute groupe of Cordelia with
the aged parent aſleep in her lap, and the phyſician watching by, without
an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of ſenſibility from the ſoft muſic which Mr. Garrick
introduced into that ſcene. The ſame obſervation will hold good with
reſpect to the additional horror excited in Macbeth, and delight in the
Tempeſt, from the judicious uſe of both ſong and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. I cannot
help quoting another inſtance of the application of muſic which I have
always thought a happy one. At the cloſe of the tragedy of the Gameſter,
when <pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0163801400:11"/> the diſtreſs is raiſed to ſuch a pitch that
lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage fails under it, how forcibly is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion left upon the
audience by muſic, accompanying the ſlow deſcent of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain over the
mournful picture! How pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable ſuch a concluſion to the uſual one of
an actor ſtraddling over dead bodies to deliver a tame moral in tame rhime to
the pit, in the ſame breath, and often in the ſame tone, in which he is to
give out the play. But ſurely no man can be ſo void of diſcernment as not
to ſee clearly the difference between recitative and muſic thus applied:
the one diverts the attention from ſenſe to ſound, breaks the propriety
and very nerve of our language, and by giving to the expreſſion of the
paſſions cadences of which we never heard an example, nor can form a
concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in real life, deſtroys that deluſion and charm of fancy which
makes the ſituations before us our own, and is the eſſence of dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
repreſentation: the other, upon the principle of the chorus of the antients,
ſerves to excite and to combine attention and emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to improve and to
continue upon the mind the impreſſions moſt worthy to be retained.</p>
            <p>I am aware that I have entered further into the grave Drama than
my ſubject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; but the digreſſion will be found ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, in
as much as the ſame doctrine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies <pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0163801400:12"/> to comic
productions, and as it will ſerve to ſhorten the trouble of the reader in
what I have further to offer.</p>
            <p>One branch of comic opera which meets with ſucceſs on our
ſtage is evidently a graft from the Burletta of the Italians; and little as I
may admire it in general, I will venture to ſay, reſpectively to the
writing, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in our ſoil. Midas, the Golden Pippin, and ſome
others, conſidered as pieces of parody and burleſque, are much better than
any Italian Burletta I know. In fact, there is in general in the Italian Drama
of this name an inſipidity, mixed with a buffoonery too low to be called
farci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, which would make the repreſentation inſupportable in England,
were the language underſtood, or attended to in any other view than as the
introduction and diſplay of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite muſic.</p>
            <p>I cannot eaſily bring myſelf to allow the higher branch of our
Comic Opera, to be of foreign extraction. From the time the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar's Opera
appeared, we find pieces in proſe, with ſongs interſperſed, ſo
approaching to regular Comedy in plot, incident, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of
character, as to make them a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſpecies from any thing we find
abroad—and is it too much to add that the ſenſe, wit, and humour to
be found in ſome of them are ſterling Engliſh marks by which we
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0163801400:13"/> may claim the ſpecies as our own? The mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical pieces
at Paris, upon the Theatre called <hi>Les Italiens,</hi> ſprung up from the
decline of a ſort of Drama where half the perſonages were Italian, as was
half the language. When Harlequin and Argentine grew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhionable, ſuch
other repreſentations as ſerved beſt for an hour of mere diſſipation
ſucceeded, and the light and eaſy muſic with which they were accompanied,
made them very popular. But the pieces are either pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodies, or founded in
general upon materials which would be thought in England too flimzy for any
thing but an after-piece. They are compoſed with an amuſing playful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of imagination, which runs Love thro' all its diviſions, and uſually
contain abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of very pretty vocal muſic with a ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of incident
and little variety of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It is not intended to degrade or depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
this ſtile of writing as applicable to a Paris audience: it is only meant to
ſtate it more widely ſeparate and diſtinct from the force and ſpirit of
regular comedy than our own. They who are unacquainted with the Paris theatre,
are referred for judgement upon this ſubject to the Deſerter, Zemira and
Azor, and other direct tranſlations; and to Daphne and Amintor, and Thomas
and Sally, and other after-pieces, very good in their kind, but written after
the French man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0163801400:14"/> The Padlock is above this claſs in
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of characters; and the French have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon their Muſical
Comic Stage to compare, as reſembling <hi>Comedy,</hi> with Love in a
Village, or the Maid of the Mill, or, to take ſtill greater credit to our
Theatre, the Duenna.</p>
            <p>The Lord of the Manor, although the leading incident of the
ſtory is profeſſedly taken from the Silvain of Marmontel, is an humble
attempt at the ſpecies of Opera which I have ventured to call Engliſh, and
to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe as a drama the next in gradation below regular Comedy, and which
might perhaps be carried a ſtep above it. It will not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be thought
want of attention to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of Marmontel's piece, which as adapted
to French manners I believe no man of taſte will diſpute, but reſpect and
prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to our ſtage, that induced me to alter and enlarge the plan and
conduct of the original, to ſubſtitute characters, and to add ſcenes and
circumſtances entirely new.</p>
            <p>I know not a feature of character pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from Marmontel,
except the ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and artleſs innocence of the young
wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men—qualities, which, to be truly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, admit of little
diverſity by change of country.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be ſorry if taking part, or even the whole of a
ſtory from a foreign ſtage, when <pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0163801400:15"/> ſuch ſtory can
be made applicable to our cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and characters, and is entirely new worked
up for that purpoſe, could be deemed plagiariſm, becauſe it would be a
confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the invention rather pedantick than uſeful.</p>
            <p>But while I am taking credit for borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo little as one
incident, there may be thoſe who think I had better have borrowed a great
deal more. I can only ſay that tranſlation, or imitation, would have coſt
leſs pains, as it is eaſier to ſpin
<note n="*" place="bottom">Filer le Sentiment.</note> ſentiment,
than to delineate character, and to write twenty ſongs to pleaſe the ear,
than half as many lines of ſuch Comedy as ought to ſatisfy the judgement. I
do not contend that a direct copy of Marmontel would not have been a much
better thing than my talents have been able to make; I only inſiſt it would
no have been Engliſh drama. Continued uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſcenes of tenderneſs
and ſenſibility <hi>(Comedie larmoyante)</hi> may pleaſe the very
refined, but the bulk of an Engliſh audience, including many of the beſt
underſtanding, go to a comic performance to laugh in ſome part of it at
leaſt. They claim a right to do ſo upon precedents of our moſt valued
plays—and every author owes it to them, ſo long as the merrieſt
amongſt them ſhews he is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0163801400:16"/> capable of
reliſhing and applauding what is elevated and affecting—an
obſervation I have always ſeen hold good in an Engliſh gallery.</p>
            <p>It might be aſſuming too much to quote any paſſages from
the Lord of the Manor, as a teſt that every part of the houſe can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
refined ſentiment; but were the fact ten times more apparent, I ſhould
ſtill adhere to my former opinion, and intermix mirth: the cenſure of a
critic of faſhion here and there in the boxes, who reckon every thing low
which is out of their own ſphere, would never perſuade me to turn Moll
Flagon out of my piece (eaſy as it would be to conduct the ſtory without
her) while ſhe excites ſo much pleaſure in general, as to prove the
character can neither be falſe in nature, nor void of humour.</p>
            <p>And now a few words upon what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive would be the plan of
writing, were men of genius and taſte to try a ſpecimen of correct
muſical comedy.</p>
            <p>In a repreſentation which is to hold
<q rend="inline">"a mirror up to nature,"</q> and which ought to
draw its chief applauſe from reaſon, vocal muſic ſhould be confined to
expreſs the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the paſſions, but never to expreſs the
exerciſe of them. Song, in any action in which reaſon tells us it would be
unnatural to ſing, muſt be prepoſterous. To fight a duel, to cudgel a
poltroon in cadence, may <pb n="xx" facs="tcp:0163801400:17"/> be borne in a burletta, upon the
ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that in the ſerious opera we ſee heroes fight lions and
monſters, and ſometimes ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their laſt ſtruggles for life in ſong,
and die in ſtrict time and tune: but theſe liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties would be totally
inadmiſſible in the kind of drama which I am recommending. My idea might be
further explained by a paſſage in the piece of Marmontel before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to. It appeared to one of the news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper critics, that I had been guilty of a
great error in not introducing a ſcene in the Silvain, wherein the <hi>Gardes
Chaſſe</hi> of the Seigneur attack the ſportſman with guns in their
hands, threatening to ſhoot him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he ſurrenders his gun which he
perſiſts in preſerving. By the bye, this ſort of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is more
natural in France than I hope it would <hi>yet</hi> be thought to be in
Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: but that was not my principal objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This ſcene upon the
French ſtage is all in ſong; and even at Paris, where licence of throwing
action into ſong is ſo much more in uſe than it is here, and where I have
often ſeen it excellently performed, the idea of five or ſix fellows with
fuſils preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a gentleman's head, and their fingers upon the
triggers, threatening his life in baſs notes, he reſiſting in tenor, and
a wife or daughter throwing herſelf between them in treble, while the
ſpectator is kept in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, <pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:0163801400:18"/> from what in
reality muſt be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary event, till the compoſer has run his air
through all its different branches, and to a great length, always gave me
diſguſt to a great degree.</p>
            <p>Muſic, therefore, if employed to expreſs action, muſt be
confined to dumb ſhew. It is the very eſſence of pantomime; and we have
lately ſeen upon the opera ſtage how well a whole ſtory may be told in
dance; but in all theſe inſtances muſic ſtands in the place of
ſpeech, and is itſelf the only organ to expreſs the ſentiments of the
actor.</p>
            <p>To return to the application of vocal muſic upon the Engliſh
theatre: it muſt not only be reſtrained from having part in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
or action of the paſſions; care muſt be alſo taken, that it does not
interrupt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay events for the iſſue of which the mind is become eager.
It ſhould always be the <hi>acceſſory</hi> and not the <hi>principal</hi>
ſubject of the drama; but at the ſame time ſpring out of it in ſuch a
manner that the difference can hardly be diſcerned, and that it ſhould
ſeem neither the one nor the other could be ſpared.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding all theſe reſtrictions, vocal muſic
judiciouſly managed would have many occaſions to diſtinguiſh its own
ſpecific charms, at the ſame time that it embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:0163801400:19"/> enriched, and elevated regular dramatic compoſitions.
In tragedy, I am convinced, the mind would peculiarly feel its powers.
<q>
                  <l>Not touch'd but rapt, not waken'd but inſpir'd.</l>
               </q> In
the humbler, but not leſs inſtructive line of comedy, its office would be
to convey through the ſweeteſt channel, and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh by the moſt
powerful impreſſions upon the mind, maxim, admonition, ſentiment,
virtue.</p>
            <p>Should any thing I have ſaid ſtrike a man of genius and
taſte with the diſtinction I have endeavoured to eſtabliſh between
comic opera and muſical comedy, viz. between
<q rend="inline">"elaborate trifles"</q> made ſecondary to
muſic, and ſenſe and ſpirit inculcated and ſuſtained by it, new
ſubjects could not be wanting to engage their trials; or if it occurred to
men of that deſcription to try an experiment upon an old ſubject, and a
poet could be found courageous enough to engraft upon Shakſpeare, as has been
done upon Milton in Comus; perhaps no ſubject could be found in the whole
range of fancy better fitted for muſical comedy than the play of "As you like
it." Indeed it ſeems by ſome ſongs thrown into the original, that it was
the idea of the great author himſelf. To multiply the <pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:0163801400:20"/>
ſongs, excellent materials might be taken from the piece itſelf, without
injury to the eloquent and brilliant paſſages which are better adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to
the energy of elocution and action. And where materials failed in the original,
what true votary of the Muſe would not find animation, and aſſiſtance
in his inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculties, from the proſpect of being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before the
public a companion to Shakſpeare!</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Lord of the Manor has been offered, not as an
example, but an excitement to improve that ſpecies of drama—
<q>
                  <l>—fungar vice cotis; acutum</l>
                  <l>Reddere quae ferrum valet, exſors ipſe ſecandi.</l>
               </q>
It would be affectation in me, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to the public, to deny
the pleaſure I have had in the very favourable reception of this piece. At
the ſame time I truſt that I am duly ſenſible how much of the
ſucceſs is to be attributed to the exertions of the performers, the merits
of the Orcheſtra, and the excellence of Mr. Jackſon's compoſition. Among
all the circumſtances of ſatisfaction, there is not one more pleaſing to
the reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than that the bringing this humble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction upon the
ſtage, has been the means of making me acquainted with a man whoſe
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:0163801400:21"/> harmony I ſincerely believe to be character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic of
his mind,—equal to any exertions, but peculiarly exquiſite; when
expreſſive of the ſocial, tender, quiet, and amiable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the
human heart.</p>
            <p>Before I diſmiſs this theatrical ſubject, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I have
hazarded many opinions that for aught I know may be ſingly mine, I am free to
confeſs, that in calling upon men of genius to try the effect of my ideas, I
have had my eye particularly upon Mr. Sheridan. As an author, he is above my
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium; as a friend, it is my pride to think we are exactly upon a level.
From the conſideration of him in both thoſe capacities, I feel myſelf
more intereſted than the reſt of the world, in a performance he has ſome
time given us reaſon to expect. His Muſe, though without participation of
my cauſe, will naturally and of neceſſity be the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of it, by
verifying and exemplifying true muſical comedy; and ſuch a ſanction from
the author whom all reſpect, will be rendered doubly precious to myſelf by
its proceeding alſo from the man I love.</p>

                  <p>Even ſo—for the ſole offence of a marriage with the
moſt amiable of womankind, I received one of Sir John's reſcripts as he
calls the ſignification of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, with a note of a thouſand
pounds, and a prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of his preſence for ever. I knew his temper too
well to reply.</p>

                  <p>You muſt know him beſt—I had conceived him of a

                  <speaker>RASHLY.</speaker>
                  <p>You are right; but this oddity has all the effects of
harſhneſs. Sir John Contraſt has ever thought deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be the
criterion of wiſdom; and is as much averſe to retract an error as a right
action. In ſhort, in his character, there is a continual variance between a
good heart and a perverſe head; and he often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears angry with all mankind,
when in fact he is only out of humour with himſelf.</p>

                  <p>No, I thought of different profeſſions to ſupport the rank
of a gentleman. I afterwards placed my eldeſt daughter, then an infant, under
the care of a relation, and went abroad—There my Annette was born, and
for the ſake of oeconomy for ſome years educated. In ſhort, after various
trials, I found I wanted ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ſome of my purſuits, and
talents perhaps for others; and my laſt reſource was a cottage and love, in
the moſt literal ſenſe of both.</p>

                  <speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
                  <p>I Confeſs, Annette, you are a very forward ſcholar in
affairs of the heart: but would you really per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade me, that the women in
France ſcorn to be in love?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>ANNETTE.</speaker>
                  <p>Juſt the contrary. Love, there, is the paſſion of all
ages. One learns to liſp it in the cradle; and they will trifle with it at
the brink of the grave; but it is always the cherup of life, not the moping
malady, as it is here.</p>

                  <speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
                  <p>And according to the notions of that fantaſtical people, how
is the paſſion to be ſhewn?</p>

                  <speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
                  <p>Surely, Annette, you muſt now be wrong: inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and
artifice may, for aught I know, be the vices <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0163801400:58"/> of fine folks
in courts and cities; but in the rural ſcenes, where you as well as myſelf
have been bred, I am perſuaded the tongue and the heart go together in all
countries alike.</p>

wiſh you ſaw a girl in Provence as ſhe trips down the mountain with a
baſket of grapes upon her head, and all her ſwains about her, with a glance
at one, and a nod at another, and a tap to a third—'till up riſes the
moon, and up ſtrikes the tabor and pipe—away go the
baſkets—"<hi>Adieu panniers, Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dange eſt faite!</hi>"—her
heart dances faſter than her feet, and ſhe makes ten lads happy inſtead
of one, by each thinking himſelf the favourite.</p>

                  <speaker>ANNETTE.</speaker>
                  <p>No, no; ſhe ſolves the myſtery at laſt, but in a lively

treaſures poor. Witneſs love and truth, how much I deſpiſe the
temptation of ambition, when weighed againſt one hour of Sophia's ſociety.
But theſe are times when ſervice to the public is a tribute that juſtice
and virtue indiſcriminately impoſe upon private happineſs. And the man
who refuſes upon their call, a ſacrifice to the exigency of his country,
ill deſerves to be a ſharer in her proſperity.</p>
