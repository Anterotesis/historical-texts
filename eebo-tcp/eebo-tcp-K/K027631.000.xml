            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN I compiled this little volume from the writings of one of the firſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Britain, and of human genius, I did not look out long for a protector for the ineſtimable treaſure.

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>A SELECTION of the Beauties of <hi>Sterne</hi> is what has been looked for by a number of his admirers for ſome time; well knowing they would form ſuch a Volume as perhaps this, nor any other language, could equal. Indeed it was highly neceſſary on a particular ſcore to make this ſelection: the <hi>chaſte</hi> lovers of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were not only deprived themſelves of the pleaſure and inſtruction ſo conſpicuous in this magnificent aſſemblage of Genius, but their riſing offspring, whoſe minds it would poliſh to the higheſt perfection were prevented from taſting the enjoyment likewiſe. The <hi>chaſte</hi> part of the world complained ſo loudly of the obſcenity which taints the writings of <hi>Sterne,</hi> (and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, with ſome reaſon), that thoſe readers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their immediate inſpection were not ſuffered to penetrate beyond the title-page of his <hi>Triſtram Shandy;</hi>—his <hi>Sentimental Journey,</hi> in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, eſcaped the general cenſure; though that is not entirely free of the fault complained of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0523900600:5"/>
To accommodate thoſe who are ſtrangers to the firſt of theſe works, I have, (I hope with ſome degree of judgment), extracted the moſt diſtinguiſhed paſſages on which the ſun of Genius ſhines ſo reſplendent, that all his competitors, in his manner of writing, are loſt in an eclipſe of affectation and unnatural rhapſody. I intended to have arranged them alphabetically, till I found the ſtories of <hi>Le Fever,</hi> the <hi>Monk,</hi> and <hi>Maria,</hi> would be too cloſely connected for the <hi>feeling reader,</hi> and would wound the boſom of <hi>ſenſibility</hi> too deeply: I therefore placed them at a proper diſtance from each other.—I need not explain my motive for introducing the Sermon on the abuſes of Conſcience, with the effuſions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity throughout it; every parent and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, I believe, (unleſs a bigotted Papiſt), will thank me.—I wiſh I could inſuſe the pleaſure that attended me in compiling this little work, into the breaſt of the reader, yet unacquainted with <hi>Sterne</hi>—as it is, I promiſe him, the hours he may devote to this great maſter of nature and the paſſions, will be marked with more fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, than any, ſince genius led him to the love of letters.</p>
            <p>The Author's opinion of many parts of the <hi>ſacred writings</hi> may with truth be applied to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0523900600:6"/>
a great part of his own, that there is to be found in them, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Sublime and noble paſſages, which, by the rules of ſound criticiſm and reaſon, may be demonſtrated to be truly elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and beautiful."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"There is ſomething in them ſo thoroughly affecting, and ſo noble and ſublime withal, that one might challenge the writings of the moſt celebrated orators of antiquity to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing like them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Before I conclude, I cannot help obſerving with an excellent writer, that, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"there are minds upon which the rays of fancy may be pointed without effect, and which no fire of ſentiment can agitate, or exalt."</q>—May ſuch minds never violate the <hi>Beanties of Sterne;</hi> but let them be, while the virtues find ſanctuary in the hearts of the amiable—their amuſement only.</p>

            <p>YOU ſee 'tis high time, ſaid my father, addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf equally to my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> and <hi>Yorick,</hi> to take this young creature out of theſe womens' hands, and put him into thoſe of a private governor.</p>
            <p>Now as I conſider the perſon who is to be about my ſon, as the mirror in which he is to view himſelf from morning to night, and by which he is to adjuſt his looks, his carriage, and perhaps the inmoſt ſentiments of his heart;—I would have one, <hi>Yorick,</hi> if poſſible, poliſhed at all points, fit for my child to look into.</p>
            <p>There is, continued my father, a certain mien and motion of the body and all its parts, both in acting and ſpeaking, which argues a man <hi>well</hi>

            <p>I will have him, continued my father, cheerful, faceté, jovial; at the ſame time, prudent, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to buſineſs, vigilant, acute, argute, inventive, quick in reſolving doubts and ſpeculative queſtions;—he ſhall be wiſe and judicious, and learned:—And why not humble, and moderate, and gentle tempered, and good? ſaid <hi>Yorick;</hi>—And why not, cried my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> free, and generous, and bountiful, and brave?—He ſhall, my dear <hi>Toby,</hi> replied my father, getting up and ſhaking him by his hand.—Then, brother <hi>Shandy,</hi> anſwered my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> raiſing himſelf off the chair, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his pipe to take hold of my father's other hand,—I humbly beg I may recommend poor <hi>Le Fever</hi>'s ſon to you;—a tear of joy of the firſt water ſparkled in my uncle <hi>Toby's</hi> eye,—and another, the fellow to it, in the Coporal's, as the propoſition was made;—you will ſee why when you read <hi>Le Fever's</hi> ſtory.</p>

            <head>THE STORY OF LE FEVER.</head>
            <p>IT was ſome time in the ſummer of that year in which <hi>Dendermond</hi> was taken by the allies; when my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> was one evening getting his ſupper, with <hi>Trim</hi> ſitting behind him at a ſmall ſideboard,—I ſay ſitting—for in conſideration of the Corporal's lame knee (which ſometimes gave him exquiſite pain)—when my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> dined or ſupped alone he would never ſuffer the Corporal to ſtand; and the poor fellow's veneration for his maſter was ſuch, that with a proper artillery, my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> could have taken <hi>Dendermond</hi> itſelf, with leſs trouble than he was able to gain this point over him; for many a time when my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> ſuppoſed the Corporal's leg was at reſt, he would look back, and detect him ſtanding behind him with the moſt dutiful reſpect: this bred more little ſquabbles betwixt them, than all other cauſes for five-and-twenty years together—But this is neither here nor there—why do I mention it?—Aſk my pen,—it governs me,—I govern not it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0523900600:16"/>
He was one evening ſitting thus at his ſupper, when the landlord of a little inn in the village came into the parlour with an empty phial in his hand, to beg a glaſs or two of ſack; 'Tis for a poor gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,—I think of the army, ſaid the landlord, who has been taken ill at my houſe four days ago, and has never held up his head ſince, or had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to taſte any thing, till juſt now, that he has a fancy for a glaſs of ſack and a thin toaſt,—"<hi>I think,</hi>" ſays he, taking his hand from his forehead, "<hi>it would comfort me.</hi>"—</p>
            <p>—If I could neither beg, borrow, or buy ſuch a thing,—added the landlord,—I would almoſt ſteal it for the poor gentleman, he is ſo ill.—I hope in God he will ſtill mend, continued he,—we are all of us concerned for him.</p>
            <p>Thou art a good-natured ſoul, I will anſwer for thee, cried my uncle <hi>Toby;</hi> and thou ſhalt drink the poor gentleman's health in a glaſs of ſack thyſelf,—and take a couple of bottles with my ſervice, and tell him he is heartily welcome to them, and to a dozen more if they will do him good.</p>
            <p>Though I am perſuaded, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> as the landlord ſhut the door, he is a very compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate fellow—<hi>Trim,</hi>—yet I cannot help enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0523900600:17"/>
a high opinion of his gueſt too; there muſt be ſomething more than common in him, that in ſo ſhort a time ſhould win ſo much upon the affections of his hoſt;—And of his whole family, added the Corporal, for they are all concerned for him.—Step after him, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi>—do <hi>Trim,</hi>—and aſk if he knows his name.</p>
            <p>—I have quite forgot it, truly, ſaid the landlord, coming back into the parlour with the Corporal,—but I can aſk his ſon again:—Has he a ſon with him then? ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>—A boy, replied the landlord, of about eleven or twelve years of age;—but the poor creature has taſted almoſt as little as his father; he does nothing but mourn and lament for him night and day:—He has not ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the bedſide theſe two days.</p>
            <p>My uncle <hi>Toby</hi> laid down his knife and fork, and thruſt his plate from before him, as the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord gave him the account; and <hi>Trim,</hi> without being ordered, took away, without ſaying one word, and in a few minutes after brought him his pipe and tobacco.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trim!</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> I have a project in my head, as it is a bad night, of wrapping myſelf
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0523900600:18"/>
up warm in my roquelaure, and paying a viſit to this poor gentleman.—Your honour's roquelaure, replied the Corporal, has not once been had on, ſince the night before your honour received your wound, when we mounted guard in the trenches before the gate of St. <hi>Nicholas;</hi>—and beſides, it is ſo cold and rainy a night, that what with the roque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laure, and what with the weather, it will be enough to give your honour your death, and bring on your honour's torment in your groin. I fear ſo, replied my uncle <hi>Toby;</hi> but I am not at reſt in my mind, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſince the account the landlord has given me.—I wiſh I had not known ſo much of this affair,—added my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi>—or that I had known more of it:—How ſhall we manage it? Leave it, an't pleaſe your honour, to me, quoth the Corporal;—I'll take my hat and ſtick and go to the houſe and reconnoitre, and act accordingly; and I will bring your honour a full account in an hour.—Thou ſhalt go, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> and here's a ſhilling ſor thee to drink with his ſervant.—I ſhall get it all out of him ſaid the Corporal, ſhutting the door.</p>
            <p>It was not till my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> had knocked the aſhes out of his third pipe, that Corporal <hi>Trim</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the inn, and gave him the following account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0523900600:19"/>
I deſpaired, at firſt, ſaid the Corporal, of being able to bring back your honour any kind of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence concerning the poor ſick Lieutenant—Is he in the army, then? ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>—He is: ſaid the Corporal—And in what regiment? ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>—I'll tell your honour, replied the Corporal, every thing ſtraight forwards, as I learnt it.—Then, <hi>Trim,</hi> I will fill another pipe, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> and not interrupt thee till thou haſt done; ſo ſit down at thy eaſe, <hi>Trim,</hi> in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow-ſeat, and begin thy ſtory again. The Corporal made his old bow, which generally ſpoke as plain as a bow could ſpeak it—<hi>Your honour is good:</hi>—And having done that, he ſat down, as he was ordered,—and began the ſtory to my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> over again in pretty near the ſame words.</p>
            <p>I deſpaired at firſt, ſaid the Corporal, of being able to bring back any intelligence to your honour, about the Lieutenant and his ſon; for when I aſked where his ſervant was, from whom I made myſelf ſure of knowing every thing which was proper to be aſked,—That's a right diſtinction, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>—I was anſwered, an' pleaſe your honour, that he had no ſervant with him;—that he had come to the inn with hired horſes, which, upon finding himſelf unable to proceed, (to join, I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0523900600:20"/>
ſuppoſe, the regiment), he had diſmiſſed the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after he came.—If I get better, my dear, ſaid he, as he gave his purſe to his ſon to pay the man,—we can hire horſes from hence.—But alas! the poor gentleman will never get from hence, ſaid the landlady to me,—for I heard the death-watch all night long;—and when he dies, the youth, his ſon, will certainly die with him; for he is broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted already.</p>
            <p>I was hearing this account, continued the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, when the youth came into the kitchen, to order the thin toaſt the landlord ſpoke of;—but I will do it for my father myſelf, ſaid the youth.—Pray let me ſave you the trouble, young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſaid I, taking up a fork for the purpoſe, and offering him my chair to ſit down upon by the fire, whilſt I did it.—I believe, Sir, ſaid he, very modeſtly, I can pleaſe him beſt myſelf.—I am ſure, ſaid I, his honour will not like the toaſt the worſe for being toaſted by an old ſoldier.—The youth took hold of my hand, and inſtantly burſt into tears.—Poor youth! ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi>—he has been bred up from an infant in the army, and the name of a ſoldier, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſounded in his ears like the name of a friend;—I wiſh I had him here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0523900600:21"/>
—I never in the longeſt march, ſaid the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, had ſo great a mind to my dinner, as I had to cry with him for company:—What could be the matter with me, an' pleaſe your honour? Nothing in the world, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> blowing his noſe,—but that thou art a good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured fellow.</p>
            <p>When I gave him the toaſt, Continued the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, I thought it was proper to tell him I was Captain <hi>Shandy's</hi> ſervant, and that your honour (though a ſtranger) was extremely concerned for his father;—and that if there was any thing in your houſe or cellar—(And thou might'ſt have added my purſe too, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>—he was heartily welcome to it:—He made a very low bow, (which was meant to your honour), but no anſwer,—for his heart was full—ſo he went up ſtairs with the toaſt;—I warrant you, my dear, ſaid I, as I opened the kitchen-door, your father will be well again.—Mr. <hi>Yorick's</hi> curate was ſmoaking a pipe by the kitchen fire,—but ſaid not a word good or bad to comſort the youth.—I thought it wrong; added the Corporal—I think ſo too, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Lieutenant had taken his glaſs of ſack and toaſt, he felt himſelf a little revived, and ſent
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0523900600:22"/>
down into the kitchen, to let me know, that in about ten minutes he ſhould be glad if I would ſtep up ſtairs.—I believe, ſaid the landlord, he is going to ſay his prayers,—for there was a book laid upon the chair by his bed-ſide, and as I ſhut the door, I ſaw his ſon take up a cuſhion.—</p>
            <p>I thought, ſaid the curate, that you gentlemen of the army, Mr. <hi>Trim,</hi> never ſaid your prayers at all.—I heard the poor gentleman ſay his prayers laſt night, ſaid the landlady, very devoutly, and with my own ears, or I could not have believed it.—Are you ſure of it, replied the curate.—A ſoldier, an' pleaſe your reverence, ſaid I, prays as often (of his own accord) as a parſon;—and when he is fighting for his king, and for his own life, and for his honour too, he has the moſt reaſon to pray to God, of any one in the whole world.—'Twas well ſaid of thee, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>—But when a ſoldier, ſaid I, an' pleaſe your reverence, has been ſtanding for twelve hours together in the trenches, up to his knees in cold water,—or engaged, ſaid I, for months to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in long and dangerous marches; haraſſed, perhaps, in his rear to-day;—haraſſing others to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow;—detached here;—countermanded there;—reſting this night out upon his arms;—beat up
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0523900600:23"/>
in his ſhirt the next;—benumbed in his joints;—perhaps without ſtraw in his tent to kneel on;—muſt ſay his prayers <hi>how</hi> and <hi>when</hi> he can.—I believe, ſaid I,—for I was piqued, quoth the Corporal, for the reputation of the army, I believe an' pleaſe your reverence, ſaid I, that when a ſoldier gets time to pray,—he prays as heartily as a parſon,—though not with all his fuſs and hypocriſy.—Thou ſhouldſt not have ſaid that, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi>—for God only knows who is a hypocrite, and who is not:—At the great and general review of us all, Corporal, at the day of judgment, (and not till then)—it will be ſeen who has done their duties in this world,—and who has not; and we ſhall be advanced, <hi>Trim,</hi> accordingly.—I hope we ſhall, ſaid <hi>Trim,</hi>—It is in the Scripture, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby;</hi> and I will ſhew it thee to-morrow:—In the mean time we may depend upon it, <hi>Trim,</hi> for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> that God Almighty is ſo good and juſt a Governor of the world, that if we have but done our duties in it,—it will never be enquired into, whether we have done them in a red coat or a black one:—I hope not; ſaid the Corporal—But go on, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> with the ſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0523900600:24"/>
When I went up, continued the Corporal, into the Lieutenant's room, which I did not do till the expiration of the ten minutes,—he was lying in his bed, with his head raiſed upon his hand, with his elbow upon the pillow, and a clean white cambrick handkerchief beſide it:—The youth was juſt ſtooping down to take up the cuſhion, upon which I ſuppoſed he had been kneeling,—the book was laid upon the bed,—and as he roſe, in taking up the cuſhion with one hand, he reached out his other to take it away at the ſame time. Let it remain there, my dear, ſaid the Lieutenant.</p>
            <p>He did not offer to ſpeak to me, till I had walked up cloſe to his bed-ſide:—If you are Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Shandy</hi>'s ſervant, ſaid he, you muſt preſent my thanks to your maſter. with my little boy's thanks along with them, for his courteſy to me;—if he was of <hi>Levens's</hi>—ſaid the Lieutenant.—I told him your honour was—Then, ſaid he, I ſerved three campaigns with him in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and remember him,—but 'tis moſt likely, as I had not the honour of any acquaintance with him, that he knows nothing of me.—You will tell him, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that the perſon his good nature has laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der obligations to him, is one <hi>Le Fever,</hi> a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in <hi>Angus</hi>'s—but he knows me not,—ſaid he,

a ſecond time, muſing;—poſſibly he may my ſtory—added he—pray tell the Captain, I was the Enſign at <hi>Breda,</hi> whoſe wife was moſt unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately killed with a muſket ſhot, as ſhe lay in my arms in my tent.—I remember the ſtory, an' pleaſe your honour, ſaid I, very well.—Do you ſo? ſaid he, wiping his eyes with his handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,—then well may I.—In ſaying this, he drew a little ring out of his boſom, which ſeemed tied with a black ribband about his neck, and kiſs'd it twice—Here, <hi>Billy,</hi> ſaid he,—the boy flew acroſs the room to the bed-ſide,—and falling down upon his knee, took the ring in his hand, and kiſſed it too,—then kiſſed his father, and ſat down upon the bed and wept.</p>
            <p>I wiſh, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> with a deep ſigh,—I wiſh, <hi>Trim,</hi> I was aſleep.</p>
            <p>Your honour, replied the Corporal, is too much concerned;—ſhall I pour your honour out a glaſs of ſack to your pipe?—Do, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I remember, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> ſighing again, the ſtory of the Enſign and his wife,—and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly well that he, as well as ſhe, upon ſome account
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0523900600:26"/>
or other, (I forget what,) was univerſally pitied by the whole regiment;—but finiſh the ſtory thou art upon:—'Tis finiſhed already, ſaid the Corporal,—for I could ſtay no longer,—ſo wiſhed his honour a good night; young <hi>Le Fever</hi> roſe from off the bed, and ſaw me to the bottom of the ſtairs; and as we went down together, told me, they had come from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and were on their route to join the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Flanders.</hi>—But alas! ſaid the Corporal,—the Lieutenant's laſt day's march is over.—Then what is to become of his poor boy? cried my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was to my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s eternal honour, that he ſet aſide every other concern, and only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered how he himſelf ſhould relieve the poor Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant and his ſon.</p>
            <p>—That kind BEING, who is a friend to the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſhall recompence thee for this.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt left this matter ſhort, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> to the Corporal, as he was putting him to bed,—and I will tell thee in what, <hi>Trim</hi>—In the firſt place, when thou madeſt an offer of my ſervices to <hi>Le Fever,</hi>—as ſickneſs and travelling are both expenſive, and thou knoweſt he was but a poor
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0523900600:27"/>
Lieutenant, with a ſon to ſubſiſt as well as himſelf out of his pay,—that thou didſt not make an offer to him of my purſe; becauſe, had he ſtood in need, thou knoweſt, <hi>Trim,</hi> he had been as welcome to it as myſelf.—Your honour knows, ſaid the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, I had no orders;—True, quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi>—thou didſt very right, <hi>Trim,</hi> as a ſoldier,—but certainly very wrong as a man.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, for which, indeed, thou haſt the ſame excuſe, continued my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi>—when thou offeredſt him whatever was in my houſe,—thou ſhouldſt have offered him my houſe too: A ſick brother officer ſhould have the beſt quarters, <hi>Trim,</hi> and if we had him with us,—we could tend and look to him:—Thou art an excellent nurſe thyſelf, <hi>Trim,</hi> and what with thy care of him, and the old woman's, and his boy's, and mine together, we might recruit him again at once, and ſet him upon his legs.—</p>
            <p>—In a fortnight or three weeks, added my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> ſmiling,—he might march.—He will never march, an' pleaſe your honour, in this world, ſaid the Corporal:—He will march; ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> riſing up from the ſide of the bed, with one ſhoe off:—An' pleaſe your honour, ſaid the Corporal, he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0523900600:28"/>
will never march, but to his grave:—He ſhall march, cried my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> marching the foot which had a ſhoe on, though without advancing an inch,—he ſhall march to his regiment.—He cannot ſtand it, ſaid the Corporal;—He ſhall be ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby;</hi>—He'll drop at laſt, ſaid the Corporal, and what will become of his boy?—He ſhall not drop, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> firmly.—A-well-o'day,—do what we can for him, ſaid <hi>Trim,</hi> maintaining his point,—the poor ſoul will die:—He ſhall not die, by G—,cried my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>—The ACCUSING SPIRIT, which flew up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's chancery with the oath, bluſh'd as he gave it in;—and the RECORDING ANGEL, as he wrote it down, dropp'd a tear upon the word, and blotted it out for ever.</p>
            <p>—My uncle <hi>Toby</hi> went to his bureau,—put his purſe into his breeches pocket, and having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Corporal to go early in the morning for a phyſician,—he went to bed and fell aſleep.</p>
            <p>The ſun looked bright the morning after, to every eye in the village but <hi>Le Fever's</hi> and his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſon's; the hand of death preſs'd heavy upon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0523900600:29"/>
his eye-lids,—and hardly could the wheel at the ciſtern turn round its circle,—when my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> who had roſe up an hour before his wonted time, entered the Lieutenant's room, and without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face or apology, ſat himſelf down upon the chair by the bed-ſide, and independently of all modes and cuſtoms, opened the curtain in the manner an old friend and brother officer would have done it, and aſked him how he did,—how he had reſted in the night,—what was his complaint,—where was his pain,—and what he could do to help him:—and without giving him time to anſwer any one of the enquiries, went on and told him of the little plan which he had been concerting with the Corporal the night before for him.—</p>
            <p>—You ſhall go home directly, <hi>Le Fever,</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> to my houſe,—and we'll ſend for a doctor to ſee what's the matter,—and we'll have an apothecary,—and the Corporal ſhall be your nurſe;—and I'll be your ſervant, <hi>Le Fever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a frankneſs in my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi>—not the <hi>effect</hi> of familiarity,—but the <hi>cauſe</hi> of it,—which let you at once into his ſoul,—and ſhewed you the goodneſs of his nature; to this, there was ſomething in his looks, and voice, and manner,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0523900600:30"/>
ſuperadded, which eternally beckoned to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate to come and take ſhelter under him; ſo that before my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> had half finiſhed the kind offers he was making to the father, had the ſon inſenſibly preſſed up cloſe to his knees, and had taken hold of the breaſt of his coat, and was pulling it towards him.—The blood and ſpirits of <hi>Le Fever,</hi> which were waxing cold and ſlow within him, and were retreating to their laſt citadel, the heart,—rallied back,—the film forſook his eyes for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,—he looked up wiſhfully in my uncle <hi>Toby's</hi> face,—then caſt a look upon his boy,—and that <hi>ligament,</hi> fine as it was,—was never broken.—</p>
            <p>Nature inſtantly ebb'd again,—the film returned to its place,—the pulſe fluttered—ſtopp'd—went on—throbb'd—ſtopp'd again—moved—ſtopp'd—ſhall I go on?—No.</p>
            <p>All that is neceſſary to be added is as follows—</p>
            <p>That my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> with young <hi>Le Fever</hi> in his hand, attended the poor Lieutenant, as chief mourners, to his grave.</p>
            <p>When my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> had turned every thing into money, and ſettled all accounts betwixt the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0523900600:31"/>
agent of the regiment and <hi>Le Fever,</hi> and betwixt <hi>Le Fever</hi> and all mankind,—there remained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in my uncle <hi>Toby's</hi> hands, than an old regimental coat and a ſword; ſo that my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> found little or no oppoſition from the world in taking adminiſtration. The coat my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> gave the Corpora;—Wear it, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> as long as it will hold together, for the ſake of the poor Lieutenant—And this, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> taking up the ſword in his hand, and drawing it out of the ſcabbard as he ſpoke—and this, <hi>Le Fever,</hi> I'll ſave for thee—'tis all the fortune, continued my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> hanging it up upon a crook, and pointing to it,—'tis all the fortune, my dear <hi>Le Fever,</hi> which God has leſt thee; but if he has given thee a heart to fight thy way with it in the world,—and thou doeſt it like a man of honour,—'tis enough for us.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> had laid a foundation, he ſent him to a public ſchool, where, excepting Whitſuntide and Chriſtmas, at which times the Corporal was punctually diſpatched for him,—he remained to the ſpring of the year, ſeventeen; when the ſtories of the Emperor's ſending his army into Hungary againſt the Turks, kindling a ſpark of fire in his boſom, he left his Greek and Latin
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0523900600:32"/>
without leave, and throwing himſelf upon his knees before my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> begged his father's ſword, and my uncle <hi>Toby's</hi> leave along with it, to go and try his fortune under Eugene.—Twice did my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> forget his wound, and cry out, <hi>Le Fever!</hi> I will go with thee, and thou ſhalt fight beſide me—And twice he laid his hand upon his groin, and hung down his head in ſorrow and diſconſolation.—</p>
            <p>My uncle <hi>Toby</hi> took down the ſword from the crook, where it had hung untouched ever ſince the Lieutenant's death, and delivered it to the Corporal to brighten up;—and having detained <hi>Le Fever</hi> a ſingle fortnight to equip him, and contract for his paſſage to Leghorn,—he put the ſword into his hand,—If thou art brave, <hi>Le Fever,</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> this will not fail thee,—but Fortune, ſaid he, (muſing a little)—Fortune may—And if ſhe does,—added my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> embracing him, come back again to me, <hi>Le Fever,</hi> and we will ſhape thee another courſe.</p>
            <p>The greateſt injury could not have oppreſſed the heart of <hi>Le Fever</hi> more than my uncle <hi>Toby's</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal kindneſs;—he parted from my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> as the beſt of ſons from the beſt of fathers—both dropped tears—and as my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> gave him
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0523900600:33"/>
his laſt kiſs, he ſlipped ſixty guineas, tied up in an old purſe of his father's, in which was his mother's ring, into his hand,—and bid God bleſs him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Le Fever</hi> got up to the Imperial army juſt time enough to try what metal his ſword was made of, at the defeat of the <hi>Turks</hi> before <hi>Belgrade;</hi> but a ſeries of unmerited miſchances had purſued him from that moment, and trod cloſe upon his heels for four years together after: he had withſtood theſe buſſetings to the laſt, till ſickneſs overtook him at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> from whence he wrote my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> word, he had loſt his time, his ſervices, his health, and, in ſhort, every thing but his ſword;—and was waiting for the firſt ſhip to return back to him</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Le Fever</hi> was hourly expected; and was upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in my uncle <hi>Toby's</hi> mind all the time my father was giving him and <hi>Yorick</hi> a deſcription of what kind of a perſon he would chooſe for a precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to me: but as my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> thought my father at firſt ſomewhat fanciful in the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he required, he forbore mentioning <hi>Le Fever's</hi> name,—till the character, by <hi>Yorick's</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ending unexpectedly, in one, who ſhould be gentle tempered, and generous, and good, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0523900600:34"/>
the image of <hi>Le Fever,</hi> and his intereſt upon my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> ſo forcibly, he roſe inſtantly off his chair; and laying down his pipe, in order to take hold of both my father's hands—I beg, brother <hi>Shandy,</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> I may recommend poor <hi>Le Fever's</hi> ſon to you—I beſeech you, do, added <hi>Yorick</hi>—He has a good heart, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>—And a brave one too, an' pleaſe your honour, ſaid the Corporal.</p>
            <p>—The beſt hearts, <hi>Trim,</hi> are ever the braveſt, replied my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>

            <head>THE PULSE.</head>
            <p>PARIS.</p>
            <p>HAIL ye ſmall ſweet courteſies of life, for ſmooth do ye make the road of it! like grace and beauty which beget inclinations to love at firſt ſight: 'tis ye who open this door and let the ſtranger in.</p>
            <p>—Pray, Madame, ſaid I, have the goodneſs to tell me which way I muſt turn to go to the Opera Comique:—Moſt willingly, Monſieur, ſaid ſhe, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide her work—</p>
            <p>I had given a caſt with my eye into half a dozen ſhops as I came along in ſearch of a face not likely to be diſordered by ſuch an interruption; till at laſt, this hitting my fancy, I had walked in.</p>
            <p>She was working a pair of ruffles as ſhe ſat in a low chair on the far ſide of the ſhop facing the door—</p>
            <p>—<hi>Tres volontiers:</hi> moſt willingly, ſaid ſhe, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her work down upon a chair next her, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0523900600:36"/>
riſing up from the low chair ſhe was ſitting in, with ſo cheerful a movement and ſo cheerful a look, that had I been laying out fifty louis d'ors with her, I ſhould have ſaid—"This woman is grateful."</p>
            <p>You muſt turn, Monſieur, ſaid ſhe, going with me to the door of the ſhop, and pointing the way down the ſtreet I was to take—you muſt turn firſt to your left hand—<hi>mais prenez garde</hi>—there are two turns; and be ſo good as to take the ſecond—then go down a little way and you'll ſee a church, and when you are paſt it, give yourſelf the trouble to turn directly to the right, and that will lead you to the foot of the <hi>pont neuf,</hi> which you muſt croſs—and there any one will do himſelf the pleaſure to ſhew you—</p>
            <p>She repeated her inſtructions three times over to me with the ſame good natured patience the third time as the firſt;—and if <hi>tones and manners</hi> have a meaning, which certainly they have, unleſs to hearts which ſhut them out—ſhe ſeemed really intereſted, that I ſhould not loſe myſelf.</p>
            <p>I will not ſuppoſe it was the woman's beauty, notwithſtanding ſhe was the handſomeſt Griſſet, I think, I ever ſaw, which had much to do with the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0523900600:37"/>
ſenſe I had of her courteſy; only I remember, when I told her how much I was obliged to her, that I looked very full in her eyes,—and that I repeated my thanks as often as ſhe had done her inſtructions.</p>
            <p>I had not got ten paces from the door, before I found I had forgot every tittle of what ſhe had ſaid—ſo looking back, and ſeeing her ſtill ſtanding in the door of the ſhop as if to look whether I went right or not—I returned back, to aſk her whether the firſt turn was to my right or left—for that I had abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely forgot.—Is it poſſible! ſaid ſhe, half laughing.—'Tis very poſſible, replied I, when a man is think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more of a woman, than of her good advice.</p>
            <p>As this was the real truth—ſhe took it, as every woman takes a matter of right, with a ſlight courteſy.</p>
            <p>—<hi>Attendez,</hi> ſaid ſhe, laying her hand upon my arm to detain me, whilſt ſhe called a lad out of the back-ſhop to get ready a parcel of gloves. am juſt going to ſend him, ſaid ſhe, with a packet into that quarter, and if you will have the complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to ſtep in, it will be ready in a moment, and he ſhall attend you to the place.—So I walked in with her to the far ſide of the ſhop, and taking up
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0523900600:38"/>
the ruffle in my hand which ſhe laid upon the chair, as if I had a mind to ſit, ſhe ſat down herſelf in her low chair, and I inſtantly ſat myſelf down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide her.</p>
            <p>—He will be ready, Monſieur, ſaid ſhe, in a moment—And in that moment, replied I, moſt willingly would I ſay ſomething very civil to you for all theſe courteſies. Any one may do a caſual act of good nature, but a continuation of them ſhews it is a part of the temperature; and certainly, added I, if it is the ſame blood which comes from the heart, which deſcends to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes (touching her wriſt), I am ſure you muſt have one of the beſt pulſes of any woman in the world—Feel it, ſaid ſhe, holding out her arm. So laying down my hat, I took hold of her fingers in one hand, and applied the two ſore-fingers of my other to the artery—</p>
            <p>—Would to heaven! my dear Eugenius, thou hadſt paſſed by, and beheld me ſitting in my black coat, and in my lack-aday-ſical manner, counting the throbs of it, one by one, with as much true devotion as if I had been watching the critical ebb or flow of her fever—How wouldſt thou have laugh'd and moralized upon my new profeſſion—
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0523900600:39"/>
and thou ſhouldſt have laugh'd and moralized on—Truſt me, my dear Eugenius, I ſhould have ſaid, "there are worſe occupations in this world <hi>than feeling a woman's pulſe.</hi>"—But a Griſſet's! thou wouldſt have ſaid—and in an open ſhop! Yorick—</p>
            <p>—So much the better: for when my views are direct, Eugenius, I care not if all the world ſaw me feel it.</p>
            <p>I had counted twenty pulſations, and was going on faſt towards the fortieth, when her huſband coming unexpected from a back parlour into the ſhop, put me a little out of my reckoning.—'Twas nobody but her huſband, ſhe ſaid,—ſo I began a freſh ſcore—Monſieur is ſo good, quoth ſhe, as he paſs'd by us, as to give himſelf the trouble of feeling my pulſe—The huſband took off his hat, and making a bow, ſaid I did him too much honour—and having ſaid that, he put on his hat and walked out.</p>
            <p>Good God! ſaid I to myſelf, as he went out—and can this man be the huſband of this woman?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0523900600:40"/>
Let it not torment the few who know what muſt have been the grounds of this exclamation, if I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it to thoſe who do not.</p>
            <p>In London a ſhop-keeper and a ſhop-keeper's wife ſeem to be one bone and one fleſh: in the ſeveral endowments of mind and body, ſometimes the one, ſometimes the other has it, ſo as in general to be upon a par, and to tally with each other as nearly as man and wife need to do.</p>
            <p>In Paris, there are ſcarce two orders of beings more different: for the legiſlative and executive powers of the ſhop not reſting in the huſband, he ſeldom comes there—in ſome dark and diſmal room behind, he ſits commerceleſs in his thrum night-cap, the ſame rough ſon of Nature that Nature left him.</p>
            <p>The genius of a people where nothing but the monarchy is <hi>ſalique,</hi> having ceded this department, with ſundry others, totally to the women—by a continual higgling with cuſtomers of all ranks and ſizes from morning to night, like ſo many rough pebbles ſhook long together in a bag, by amicable colliſions they have worn down their aſperities and ſharp angles, and not only become round and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0523900600:41"/>
ſmooth, but will receive, ſome of them, a poliſh like a brilliant—Monſieur <hi>Le Marli</hi> is little better than the ſtone under your foot—</p>
            <p>—Surely—ſurely, man! it is not good for thee to ſit alone—thou waſt made for ſocial intercourſe and gentle greetings, and this improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our natures from it, I appeal to, as my evidence.</p>
            <p>—And how does it beat, Monſieur? ſaid ſhe.—With all the benignity, ſaid I, looking quietly in her eyes, that I expected—She was going to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing civil in return—but the lad came into the ſhop with the gloves—<hi>A propos,</hi> ſaid I, I want a couple of pair myſelf.</p>
            <p>The beautiful Griſſet roſe up when I ſaid this, and going behind the counter, reached down a parcel and untied it: I advanced to the ſide over againſt her: they were all too large. The beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Griſſet meaſured them one by one acroſs my hand—It would not alter the dimenſions—She begged I would try a ſingle pair, which ſeemed to be the leaſt—She held it open—my hand ſlipped into it at once—It will not do, ſaid I, ſhaking my head a little—No, ſaid ſhe, doing the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0523900600:42"/>
There are certain combined looks of ſimple ſubtlety—where whim, and ſenſe, and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and nonſenſe, are ſo blended, that all the languages of Babel ſet looſe together could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them—they are communicated and caught ſo inſtantaneouſly, that you can ſcarce ſay which party is the infector. I leave it to your men of words to ſwell pages about it—it is enough in the preſent to ſay again, the gloves would not do; ſo folding our hands within our arms, we both loll'd upon the counter—it was narrow, and there was juſt room for the parcel to lay between us</p>
            <p>The beautiful Griſſet looked ſometimes at the gloves, then ſide-ways to the window, then at the gloves—and then at me. I was not diſpoſed to break ſilence—I followed her example: ſo I looked at the gloves, then to the window, then at the gloves, and then at her—and ſo on alternately.</p>
            <p>I found I loſt conſiderably in every attack—ſhe had a quick black eye, and ſhot through two ſuch long and ſilken eye-laſhes with ſuch penetration, that ſhe looked into my very heart and reins—It may ſeem ſtrange, but I could actually feel ſhe did—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0523900600:43"/>
It is no matter, ſaid I, taking up a couple of the pairs next me, and putting them into my pocket.</p>
            <p>I was ſenſible the beautiful Griſſet had not aſk'd above a ſingle livre above the price—I wiſh'd ſhe had aſk'd a livre more, and was puzzling my brains how to bring the matter about—Do you think, my dear Sir, ſaid ſhe, miſtaking my embarraſſment, that I could aſk a <hi>ſous</hi> too much of a ſtranger—and of a ſtranger whoſe politeneſs, more than his want of gloves, has done me the honour to lay himſelf at my mercy?—<hi>M'en croyez capable?</hi>—Faith! not I, ſaid I; and if you were, you are welcome—ſo counting the money into her hand, and with a lower bow than one generally makes to a ſhopkeeper's wife, I went out, and her lad with his parcel followed me.</p>

            <head>THE PIE-MAN.</head>
            <p>SEEING a man ſtanding with a baſket on the other ſide of a ſtreet, in Verſailles, as if he had ſomething to ſell, I bid La Fleur go up to him and enquire for the Count de B***'s hotel.</p>
            <p>La Fleur returned a little pale: and told me it was a Chevalier de St. Louis ſelling <hi>patés</hi>—It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, La Fleur! ſaid I.—La Fleur could no more account for the phenomenon than myſelf; but perſiſted in his ſtory: he had ſeen the croix ſet in gold, with its red ribband, he ſaid, tied to his button-hole—and had looked into his baſket and ſeen the <hi>patés</hi> which the Chevalier was ſelling; ſo could not be miſtaken in that.</p>
            <p>Such a reverſe in a man's life awakens a better principle than curioſity: I could not help looking for ſome time at him as I ſat in the <hi>remiſe</hi>—the more I looked at him, his croix and his baſket, the ſtronger they wove themſelves into my brain—I got out of the <hi>remiſe</hi> and went towards him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0523900600:45"/>
He was begirt with a clean linen apron which fell below his knees, and with a ſort of a bib which went half way up his breaſt; upon the top of this, but a little below the hem, hung his croix. His baſket of little <hi>patés</hi> was covered over with a white damaſk napkin; another of the ſame kind was ſpread at the bottom; and there was a look of <hi>propreté</hi> and neatneſs throughout; that one might have bought his <hi>patés</hi> of him, as much from appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite as ſentiment.</p>
            <p>He made an offer of them to neither; but ſtood ſtill with them at the corner of a hotel, for thoſe to buy who choſe it, without ſolicitation.</p>
            <p>He was about forty-eight—of a ſedatelook, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing approaching to gravity. I did not wonder.—I went up rather to the baſket than him, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lifted up the napkin and taken one of his <hi>patés</hi> into my hand—I begg'd he would explain the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance which affected me.</p>
            <p>He told me in a few words, that the beſt part of his life had paſſed in the ſervice, in which, after ſpending a ſmall patrimony, he had obtained a company and the croix with it; but that, at the concluſion of the laſt peace, his regiment being
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0523900600:46"/>
reformed, and the whole corps, with thoſe of ſome other regiments, left without any proviſion,—he found himſelf in a wide world without friends, without a livre—and indeed, ſaid he, without any thing but this—(pointing, as he ſaid it, to his croix)—The poor Chevalier won my pity, and he finiſhed the ſcene with winning my eſteem too.</p>
            <p>The king, he ſaid, was the moſt generous of princes, but his generoſity could neither relieve or reward every one, and it was only his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be amongſt the number. He had a little wiſe, he ſaid, whom he loved, who did the <hi>patiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie;</hi> and added, he felt no diſhonour in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her and himſelf from want in this way—un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs providence had offered him a better.</p>
            <p>It would be wicked to withhold a pleaſure from the good, in paſſing over what happened to this poor Chevalier of St. Louis about nine months after.</p>
            <p>It ſeems he uſually took his ſtand near the iron gates which lead up to the palace, and as his croix had caught the eyes of numbers, numbers had made the ſame enquiry which I had done—
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0523900600:47"/>
He had told them the ſame ſtory, and always with ſo much modeſty and good ſenſe, that it had reached at laſt the King's ears—who hearing the Chevalier had been a gallant officer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by the whole regiment as a man of honour and integrity—he broke up his little trade by a penſion of fifteen hundred livres a year.</p>

            <head>THE SWORD.</head>
            <p>RENNES.</p>
            <p>WHEN ſtates and empires have their periods of declenſion, and feel in their turns what diſtreſs and poverty is—I ſtop not to tell the cauſes which gradually brought the houſe d'E**** in Britanny into decay. The Marquis d'E**** had fought up againſt his condition with great firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; wiſhing to preſerve, and ſtill ſhew to the world, ſome little fragments of what his anceſtors had been—their indiſcretions had put it out of his power. There was enough left for the little exigencies of <hi>obſcurity</hi>—But he had two boys who looked up to him for <hi>light</hi>—he thought they deſerved it. He had tried his ſword—it could not open the way—the <hi>mounting</hi> was too expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive—and ſimple oeconomy was not a match for it—there was no reſource but commerce.</p>
            <p>In any other province in France, ſave Britanny, this was ſmiting the root for ever of the little tree his pride and affection wiſhed to ſee re-bloſſom—
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0523900600:49"/>
But in Britanny, there being a proviſion for this, he availed himſelf of it; and taking an occaſion when the ſtates were aſſembled at Rennes, the Marquis, attended with his two ſons, entered the court; and having pleaded the right of an ancient law of the duchy, which, though ſeldom claimed, he ſaid, was no leſs in force; he took his ſword from his ſide—Here, ſaid he, take it; and be truſty guardians of it, till better times put me in condition to reclaim it.</p>
            <p>The preſident accepted the Marquis's ſword—he ſtaid a few minutes to ſee it depoſited in the archives of his houſe, and departed.</p>
            <p>The Marquis and his whole family embarked the next day for Martinico, and in about nineteen or twenty years of ſucceſsful application to buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with ſome unlooked for bequeſts from diſtant branches of his houſe—returned home to reclaim his nobility and to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>It was an incident of good fortune which will never happen to any traveller, but a ſentimental one, that I ſhould be at Rennes at the very time of this ſolemn requiſition: I call it ſolemn—it was ſo to me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0523900600:50"/>
The Marquis entered the court with his whole family: he ſupported his lady—his eldeſt ſon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported his ſiſter, and his youngeſt was at the other extreme of the line next his mother—he put his handkerchief to his face twice—</p>
            <p>—There was a dead ſilence. When the Marquis had approached within ſix paces of the tribunal, he gave the Marchioneſs to his youngeſt ſon, and advancing three ſteps before his family—he reclaimed his ſword.—His ſword was given him, and the moment he got it into his hand he drew it almoſt out of the ſcabbard—it was the ſhining face of a friend he had once given up—he looked attentively a long it, beginning at the hilt, as if to ſee whether it was the ſame—when obſerving a little ruſt which it had contracted near the point, he brought it near his eye, and bending his head down over it—I think I ſaw a tear fall upon the place: I could not be deceived by what followed.</p>
            <p>"I ſhall find, ſaid he, ſome <hi>other way,</hi> to get it off."</p>
            <p>When the Marquis had ſaid this, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſword into its ſcabbard, made a bow to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0523900600:51"/>
the guardians of it—and, with his wife and daughter, and his two ſons following him, walked out.</p>
            <p>O how I envied him his feelings!</p>

            <p>I WAS ſtopped at the gate of <hi>Lyons</hi> by a poor aſs, who had juſt turned in with a couple of large panniers upon his back, to collect eleemoſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary turnip-tops, and cabbage-leaves; and ſtood dubious, with his two fore-feet on the inſide of the threſhold, and with his two hinder feet towards the ſtreet, as not knowing very well whether he was to go in, or no.</p>
            <p>Now, 'tis an animal (be in what hurry I may) I cannot bear to ſtrike—there is a patient endurance of ſufferings, wrote ſo unaffectedly in his looks and carriage, which pleads ſo mightily for him, that it always diſarms me; and to that degree, that I

do not like to ſpeak unkindly to him: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, meet him where I will—whether in town or country—in cart or under panniers—whether in liberty or bondage—I have ever ſomething civil to ſay to him on my part; and as one word begets another (if he has as little to do as I)—I generally fall into converſation with him; and ſurely never is my imagination ſo buſy, as in framing his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſes from the etchings of his countenance—and where thoſe carry me not deep enough—in flying from my own heart into his, and ſeeing what is natural for an aſs to think—as well as a man, upon the occaſion.—In truth, it is the only creature of all the claſſes of beings below me, with whom I can do this:—for parrots, jackdaws, &amp;c. I never exchange a word with them—nor with the apes, &amp;c. for pretty near the ſame reaſon; they act by rote, as the others ſpeak by it, and equally make me ſilent: nay my dog and my cat, though I value them both—(and for my dog he would ſpeak if he could)—yet ſome how or other, they neither of them poſſeſs the talents for converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—I can make nothing of a diſcourſe with them.</p>

to paſs betwixt him and the gate—art thou for coming in, or going out?</p>
            <p>The aſs twiſted his head round to look up the ſtreet—</p>

            <p>I underſtand thee perfectly, anſwered I—if thou takeſt a wrong ſtep in this affair, he will cudgel thee to death—Well! a minute is but a minute, and if it ſaves a fellow-creature a drubbing, it ſhall not be ſet down as ill-ſpent. He was eating the ſtem of an artichoke as this diſcourſe went on, and in the little peeviſh contentions of nature betwixt hunger and unſavourineſs, had dropt it out of his mouth half a dozen times, and picked it up again—God help thee, Jack! ſaid I, thou haſt a bitter breakfaſt on't—and many a bitter day's labour—and many a bitter blow, I fear for its wages—'tis all—all bitterneſs to thee, whatever life is to others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0523900600:54"/>
And now thy mouth, if one knew the truth of it, is as bitter, I dare ſay, as ſoot—(for he had caſt aſide the ſtem) and thou haſt not a friend per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in all this world, that will give thee a maca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roon.—In ſaying this, I pulled out a paper of them, which I had juſt purchaſed, and gave him one—and at this moment that I am telling it, my heart ſmites me, that there was more of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry in the conceit, of ſeeing how an aſs would eat a macaroon—than of benevolence in giving him one, which preſided in the act.</p>
            <p>When the aſs had eaten his macaroon, I preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to come in—the poor beaſt was heavy loaded—his legs ſeemed to tremble under him—he hung rather backwards, and as I pulled at his halter, it broke ſhort in my hand—he looked up penſive in my face—"Don't thraſh me with it—but if you will, you may"—If I do, ſaid I, I'll be d—d. The word was but one half of it pronounced, when a perſon coming in, let fall a thundering baſtinado upon the poor devil's crup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which put an end to the ceremony.

            <p>Sir, quoth Doctor <hi>Slop, Trim</hi> is certainly in the right; for the writer (who I perceive is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant) by the ſnappiſh manner in which he takes up the apoſtle, is certainly going to abuſe him; if this treatment of him has not done it already.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0523900600:56"/>
But from whence, replied my father, have you concluded ſo ſoon, Doctor <hi>Slop,</hi> that the writer is of our church?—for aught I can ſee yet,—he may be of any church.—Becauſe, anſwered Doctor <hi>Slop,</hi> if he was of ours,—he durſt no more take ſuch a licence,—than a bear by his beard:—If, in our communion, Sir, a man was to inſult an apoſtle,—a ſaint,—or even the paring of a ſaint's nail,—he would have his eyes ſcratched out.—What, by the ſaint? quoth my uncle Toby. No, replied Doctor <hi>Slop,</hi> he would have an old houſe over his head. Pray, is the Inquiſition an ancient building, anſwered my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> or is it a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern one?—I know nothing of architecture, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Doctor <hi>Slop.</hi>—An' pleaſe your honours, quoth <hi>Trim,</hi> the Inquiſition is the vileſt—Prithee ſpare thy deſcription, <hi>Trim,</hi> I hate the very name of it, ſaid my father.—No matter for that, anſwered Doctor <hi>Slop,</hi>—it has its uſes; for though I'm no great advocate for it, yet, in ſuch a caſe as this, he would ſoon be taught better manners; and I can tell him, if he went on at that rate, would be flung into the Inquiſition for his pains. God help him then, quoth my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi> Amen, added <hi>Trim,</hi> for heaven above knows I have a poor brother who has been fourteen years a captive in it.—I never heard one word of it before, ſaid my

            <p>[All this is impoſſible with us, quoth Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> turning to my father,—the caſe could not happen in our church.—It happens in ours, however, replied my father, but too often.—I own, quoth Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> (ſtruck a little with my father's frank ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment)—that a man in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church may live as badly;—but then he cannot eaſily die ſo.—'Tis little matter, replied my father, with an air of indifference,—how a raſcal dies.—I mean, anſwered Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> he would be denied the benefits of the laſt ſacraments.—Pray how many have you in all, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi>—for I always forget?—Seven, anſwered Dr. <hi>Slop.</hi>—Humph!—ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby;</hi> though not accented as a note of acquieſcence,—but as an interjection of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſpecies of ſurpriſe, when a man in looking into a drawer, finds more of a thing than he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.—Humph! replied my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi> Dr.

            <p>"Another is ſordid, unmerciful," (here <hi>Trim</hi> waved his right hand) "a ſtrait-hearted, ſelfiſh wretch, incapable either of private friendſhip or public ſpirit.

[An' pleaſe your honours, cried <hi>Trim,</hi> I think this a viler man than the other.]</p>
            <p>"Shall not conſcience riſe up and ſting him on ſuch occaſions?—No; thank God there is no occaſion, <hi>I pay every man his own;—I have no fornication to anſwer to my conſcience;—no faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi>

            <p>[The character of this laſt man, ſaid Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> interrupting <hi>Trim,</hi> is more deteſtable than all the reſt;—and ſeems to have been taken from ſome pettifogging lawyer amongſt you:—amongſt us, a man's conſcience could not poſſibly continue ſo long <hi>blinded,</hi>—three times in a year, at leaſt, he muſt go to confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

            <p>"A fourth man ſhall want even this refuge; ſhall break through all their ceremony of ſlow chicane;—ſcorns the doubtful workings of ſecret plots and cautious trains to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his purpoſe:—See the bare-faced vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, how he cheats, lies, perjures, robs, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders!—Horrid!—But indeed much better was not to be expected, in the preſent caſe—the poor man was in the dark!—his Prieſt had got the keeping of his conſcience;—and all he would let him know of it, was, That

he muſt believe in the Pope;—go to Maſs;—croſs himſelf;—tell his beads;—be a good Catholic, and that this, in all conſcience, was enough to carry him to heaven. What;—if he perjures!—Why;—he had a mental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in it.—But if he is ſo wicked and abandoned a wretch as you repreſent him;—if he robs,—if he ſtabs, will not conſcience, on every ſuch act, receive a wound itſelf?—Aye,—but the man has carried it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;—the wound digeſts there, and will do well enough, and in a ſhort time be quite healed up by abſolution. O Popery! what haſt thou to anſwer for?—when, not content with the too many natural and fatal ways, thro' which the heart of man is every day thus treacherous to itſelf above all things;—thou haſt wilfully ſet open the wide gate of deceit before the face of this unwary tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, too apt, God knows, to go aſtray of himſelf; and confidently ſpeak peace to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when there is no peace."</p>
            <p>"Of this the common inſtances which I have drawn out of life, are too notorious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much evidence. If any man doubts the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0523900600:69"/>
reality of them, or thinks it impoſſible for a man to be ſuch a bubble to himſelf,—I muſt refer him a moment to his own reflections, and will then venture to truſt my appeal with his own heart."</p>
            <p>"Let him conſider in how different a degree of deteſtation, numbers of wicked actions ſtand <hi>there,</hi> tho' equally bad and vicious in their own natures;—he will ſoon find, that ſuch of them as ſtrong inclination and cuſtom have prompted him to commit, are generally dreſſed out and painted with all the falſe beauties, which a ſoft and a flattering hand can give them;—and that the others, to which he feels no propenſity, appear, at once, naked and deformed, ſurrounded with all the true circumſtances of folly and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour."</p>
            <p>"When <hi>David</hi> ſurpriſed <hi>Saul</hi> ſleeping in the cave, and cut off the ſkirt of his robe—we read his heart ſmote him for what he had done:—But in the matter of <hi>Uriah,</hi> where a faithful and gallant ſervant, whom he ought to have loved and honoured, fell to make way for his luſt,—where conſcience had ſo

much greater reaſon to take the alarm, his heart ſmote him not. A whole year had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt paſſed from the firſt commiſſion of that crime, to the time <hi>Nathan</hi> was ſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him; and we read not once of the leaſt ſorrow or compunction of heart which he teſtified, during all that time, for what he had done."</p>
            <p>"Thus conſcience, this once able monitor,—placed on high as a judge within us, and intended by our Maker as a juſt and equitable one too,—by an unhappy train of cauſes and impediments, takes often ſuch imperfect cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of what paſſes,—does its office ſo negligently,—ſometimes ſo corruptly,—that it is not to be truſted alone; and therefore we find there is a neceſſity, an abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, of joining another principle with it, to aid, if not govern, its determinations."</p>
            <p>"So that if you would form a juſt judgment of what is of infinite importance to you not to be miſled in,—namely, in what degree of real merit you ſtand either as an honeſt man, an uſeful citizen, a faithful ſubject to your king, or a good ſervant to your God,

—call in religion and morality.—Look, what is written in the law of God?—How readeſt thou?—Conſult calm reaſon and the unchangeable obligations of juſtice and truth;—what ſay they?"</p>
            <p>"Let CONSCIENCE determine the matter upon theſe reports;—and then if thy heart condemns thee not, which is the caſe the apoſtle ſuppoſes,—the rule will be infallible,"—[Here Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> fell aſleep]—"<hi>thou wilt have confidence towards God;</hi>—that is, have juſt grounds to believe the judgment thou haſt paſt upon thyſelf, is the judgment of God; and nothing elſe but an anticipation of that righteous ſentence, which will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon thee hereafter by that Being, to whom thou art finally to give an account of thy actions."</p>

it is now clear, that the Parſon, as I thought at firſt, never inſulted St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the leaſt;—nor has there been, brother, the leaſt difference between them:—A great matter, if they had differed, replied my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi>—the beſt friends in the world may differ ſometimes.—True,—brother <hi>Toby,</hi> quoth my father, ſhaking hands with him,—we'll fill our pipes, brother, and then <hi>Trim</hi> ſhall go on.—</p>
            <p>He read on as follows.]</p>
            <p>"To have the fear of God before our eyes, and, in our mutual dealings with each other, to govern our actions by the eternal mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of right and wrong:—The firſt of theſe will comprehend the duties of religion;—the ſecond, thoſe of morality, which are ſo inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perably connected together, that you cannot divide theſe two <hi>tables,</hi> even in imagination, (though the attempt is often made in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice) without breaking and mutually deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them both."</p>
            <p>"I ſaid the attempt is often made; and ſo it is;—there being nothing more common than to ſee a man who has no ſenſe at all of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0523900600:74"/>
religion, and indeed has ſo much honeſty as to pretend to none, who would take it as the bittereſt affront, ſhould you but hint at a ſuſpicion of his moral character,—or imagine he was not conſcientiouſly juſt and ſcrupulous" to the uttermoſt mite."</p>
            <p>"When there is ſome appearance that it is ſo,—tho' one is unwilling even to ſuſpect the appearance of ſo amiable a virtue as moral honeſty, yet were we to look into the grounds of it, in the preſent caſe, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded we ſhould find little reaſon to envy ſuch a one the honour of his motive."</p>
            <p>"Let him declaim as pompouſly as he chooſes upon the ſubject, it will be found to reſt upon no better foundation than either his intereſt, his pride, his eaſe, or ſome ſuch little and changeable paſſion as will give us but ſmall dependance upon his actions in matters of great diſtreſs."</p>

            <p>"Now let me examine what is my reaſon for this great confidence. Why, in the firſt place, I believe there is no probability that either of them will employ the power I put into their hands to my diſadvantage;—I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that honeſty ſerves the purpoſes of this life:—I know their ſucceſs in the world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the fairneſs of their characters.—In a word, I'm perſuaded that they cannot hurt me without hurting themſelves more."</p>
            <p>"But put it otherwiſe, namely, that intereſtlay, for once, on the other ſide; that a caſe ſhould happen wherein the one, without ſtain to his reputation, could ſecrete my fortune, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0523900600:76"/>
leave me naked in the world;—or that the other could ſend me out of it, and enjoy an eſtate by my death, without diſhonour to himſelf or his art:—In this caſe, what hold have I of either of them?—Religion, the ſtrongeſt of all motives, is out of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;—Intereſt, the next moſt powerful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the world, is ſtrongly againſt me:—What have I leſt to caſt into the oppoſite ſcale to balance this temptation?—Alas!

            <p>"As, therefore, we can have no dependence upon morality without religion;—ſo, on the other hand, there is nothing better to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from religion without morality; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, 'tis no prodigy to ſee a man whoſe real moral character ſtands very low, who yet entertains the higheſt notion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in the light of a religious man."</p>
            <p>"He ſhall not only be covetous, revengeful, implacable,—but even wanting in points of

            <head>REMAINDER OF THE STORY OF TRIM'S BROTHER.</head>
            <p>AS <hi>Tom's</hi> place an' pleaſe your honour, was eaſy—and the weather warm—it put him upon thinking ſeriouſly of ſettling himſelf in the world; and as it fell out about that time, that a <hi>Jew</hi> who kept a ſaugage ſhop in the ſame ſtreet, had the ill luck to die of a ſtrangury, and leave his widow in poſſeſſion of a rouſing trade—<hi>Tom</hi> thought (as every body in <hi>Liſbon</hi> was doing the beſt he could diviſe for himſelf) there could be no harm in offering her his ſervice to carry it on: ſo without any introduction to the widow, except that of buying a pound of ſauſages at her ſhop—<hi>Tom</hi> ſet out—counting the matter thus within himſelf, as he walked along; that let the worſt come of it that could, he ſhould at leaſt get a pound of ſauſages for their worth—but, if things went well, he ſhould be ſet up; inaſmuch as he ſhould get not only a pound of ſauſages—but a wife—and a ſauſage ſhop, an' pleaſe your honour, into the bargain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0523900600:86"/>
Every ſervant in the family, from high to low, wiſhed <hi>Tom</hi> ſucceſs, and I can fancy, an' pleaſe your honour, I ſee him this moment with his white dimity waiſtcoat and breeches, and hat a little o'one ſide, paſſing jollily along the ſtreet, ſwinging his ſtick, with a ſmile and a cheerful word for every body he met.</p>
            <p>But alas! <hi>Tom!</hi> thou ſmileſt no more, cried the Corporal, looking on one ſide of him upon the ground, as if he apoſtrophiſed him in his dungeon.</p>
            <p>Poor fellow! ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> feelingly.</p>
            <p>He was an honeſt, light-hearted lad, an' pleaſe your honour, as ever blood warm'd—</p>
            <p>Then he reſembled thee, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> rapidly.</p>
            <p>The Corporal bluſh'd down to his fingers ends—a tear of ſentimental baſhfulneſs—another of gratitude to my uncle. <hi>Toby</hi>—and a tear of ſorrow for his brother's misfortunes, ſtarted into his eye, and ran ſweetly down his cheek together; my uncle <hi>Toby's</hi> kindled as one lamp does at
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0523900600:87"/>
another; and taking hold of the breaſt of <hi>Trim's</hi> coat (which had been that of <hi>Le Fever's</hi>), as if to eaſe his lame leg, but in reality to gratify a finer feeling—he ſtood ſilent for a minute and a half; at the end of which he took his hand away, and the Corporal making a bow, went on with his ſtory of his brother and the <hi>Jew's</hi> widow.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Tom,</hi> an' pleaſe your honour, got to the ſhop, there was nobody in it, but a poor negro girl, with a bunch of white feathers ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tied to the end of a long cane, flapping away flies—not killing them.—</p>
            <p>'Tis a pretty picture! ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi>—ſhe had ſuffered perſecution, <hi>Trim,</hi> and had learnt mercy—</p>
            <p>—She was good, an' pleaſe your honour, from nature, as well as from hardſhips; and there are circumſtances in the ſtory of that poor friendleſs ſlut, that would melt a heart of ſtone, ſaid <hi>Trim;</hi> and ſome diſmal winter's evening when your honour is in the humour, they ſhall be told you with the reſt of <hi>Tom's</hi> ſtory, for it makes a part of it</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0523900600:88"/>
Then do not forget, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A negro has a ſoul? an' pleaſe your honour, ſaid the Corporal, (doubtingly).</p>
            <p>I am not much verſed, Corporal, quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> in things of that kind; but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, God would not leave him without one, any more than thee or me.</p>
            <p>It would be putting one ſadly over the head of another, quoth the Corporal.</p>
            <p>It would ſo, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why then, an' pleaſe your honour, is a black wench to be uſed worſe than a white one?</p>
            <p>I can give no reaſon, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>—</p>
            <p>—Only, cried the Corporal, ſhaking his head, becauſe ſhe has no one to ſtand up for her—</p>
            <p>'Tis that very thing, <hi>Trim,</hi> quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi>—which recommends her to protection—and her brethren with her; 'tis the fortune of war which has put the whip into our hands
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0523900600:89"/>
               <hi>now</hi>—where it may be hereafter, heaven knows!—but be it where it will, the brave, <hi>Trim,</hi> will not uſe it unkindly.</p>
            <p>—God forbid, ſaid the Corporal.</p>
            <p>Amen, reſponded my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> laying his hand upon his heart.</p>
            <p>The Corporal returned to his ſtory, and went on—but with an embarraſſment in doing it, which here and there a reader in this world will not be able to comprehend; for by the many ſudden tranſitions all along, from one kind and cordial paſſion to another, in getting thus far on his way, he had loſt the ſportable key of his voice, which gave ſenſe and ſpirit to his tale: he attempted twice to reſume it, but could not pleaſe himſelf; ſo giving a ſtout hem! to rally back the retreating ſpirits, and aiding nature at the ſame time with his left arm a-kimbo on one ſide, and with his right a little extended, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported her on the other—the Corporal got as near the note as he could; and in that attitude, continued his ſtory.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Tom,</hi> an' pleaſe your honour, had no buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at that time with the Mooriſh girl, he paſſed
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0523900600:90"/>
on into the room beyond, to talk to the <hi>Jew's</hi> widow about love—and being, as I have told your honour, an open, cheary hearted lad, with his character wrote in his looks and carriage, he took a chair, and without much apology, but with great civility at the ſame time, placed it cloſe to her at the table, and ſat down.</p>
            <p>Now a widow, an' pleaſe your honour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways chooſes a ſecond huſband as unlike the firſt as ſhe can: ſo the affair was ſettled in her mind before <hi>Tom</hi> mentioned it.</p>
            <p>She ſigned the capitulation—and <hi>Tom</hi> ſealed it; and there was an end of the matter.</p>

            <head>THE BEGUINE.</head>
            <p>SO, thou waſt once in love, <hi>Trim!</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> ſmiling—</p>
            <p>Souſe! replied the Corporal—over head and ears! an' pleaſe your honour. Prithee when? where?—and how came it to paſs?—I never heard one word of it before, quoth my uncle <hi>Toby:</hi>—I dare ſay, anſwered <hi>Trim,</hi> that every drummer and ſerjeant's ſon in the regiment knew of it—It's high time I ſhould—ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your honour remembers with concern, ſaid the Corporal, the total rout and confuſion of our camp, and the army, at the affair of <hi>Landen;</hi> every one was left to ſhift for himſelf; and if it had not been for the regiments of <hi>Wyndham, Lumley,</hi> and <hi>Galway,</hi> which covered the retreat over the bridge of <hi>Neerſpeeken,</hi> the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could ſcarce have gained it—he was preſſed hard, as your honour knows, on every ſide of him—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0523900600:92"/>
Gallant mortal! cried my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> caught up with enthuſiaſm—this moment, now that all is loſt, I ſee him galloping acroſs me, Corporal, to the left, to bring up the remains of the Engliſh horſe along with him to ſupport the right, and tear the laurel from <hi>Luxembourg's</hi> brows, if yet 'tis poſſible—I ſee him with the knot of his ſcarf juſt ſhot off, infuſing freſh ſpirits into poor <hi>Galway's</hi> regiment—riding along the line—then wheeling about, and charging <hi>Conti</hi> at the head of it—Brave! brave, by heaven! cried my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> he deſerves a crown—as richly, as a thief a halter; ſhouted <hi>Trim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My uncle <hi>Toby</hi> knew the Corporal's loyalty;—otherwiſe the compariſon was not at all to his mind—it did not altogether ſtrike the Corporal's fancy when he had made it—but it could not be recalled—ſo he had nothing to do, but proceed.</p>
            <p>As the number of wounded was prodigious, and no one had time to think of any thing, but his own ſafety—Though <hi>Talmaſh,</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> brought off the foot with great prudence—but I was left upon the field, ſaid the Corporal. Thou waſt ſo; poor fellow! replied my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>—ſo that it was noon the next day, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Corporal, before I was exchanged,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0523900600:93"/>
and put into a cart with thirteen or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen more, in order to be conveyed to our hoſpital.—The anguiſh of my knee, continued the Corporal, was exceſſive in itſelf; and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs of the cart, with the roughneſs of the roads which were terribly cut up—making bad ſtill worſe—every ſtep was death to me: ſo that with the loſs of blood, and the want of care taking of me, and a fever I felt coming on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides—(Poor ſoul! ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>) all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, an' pleaſe your honour, was more than I could ſuſtain.</p>
            <p>I was telling my ſufferings to a young woman at a peaſant's houſe, where our cart, which was the laſt of the line, had halted, they had helped me in, and the young woman had taken a cordial out of her pocket and dropp'd it upon ſome ſugar, and ſeeing it had cheer'd me, ſhe had given it me a ſecond and a third time—So I was telling her, an' pleaſe your honour, the anguiſh I was in, and was ſaying it was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable to me, that I had much rather lie down upon the bed, turning my face towards one which was in the corner of the room—and die, than go on—when, upon her attempting to lead me to it, I fainted away in her arms. She was
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0523900600:94"/>
a good ſoul! as your honour, ſaid the Coporal, wiping his eyes, will hear.</p>
            <p>I thought love had been a joyous thing, quoth my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis the moſt ſerious thing, an' pleaſe your honour (ſometimes), that is in the world.</p>
            <p>By the perſuaſion of the young woman, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Corporal, the cart with the wounded men ſet off without me: ſhe had aſſured them I ſhould expire immediately if I was put into the cart. So when I came to myſelf—I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a ſtill quiet cottage, with no one but the young woman, and the peaſant and his wife. I was laid acroſs the bed in the corner of the room, with my wounded leg upon a chair, and the young woman beſide me, holding the corner of her handkerchief dipp'd in vinegar to my noſe with one hand, and rubbing my temples with the other.</p>
            <p>I took her at firſt for the daughter of the peaſant; (for it was no inn)—ſo had offered her a little purſe with eighteen florins, which my poor brother <hi>Tom</hi> (here <hi>Trim</hi> wip'd his eyes)
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0523900600:95"/>
had ſent me as a token, by a recruit, juſt before he ſet out for <hi>Liſbon.</hi>—</p>
            <p>The young woman called the old man and his wife into the room, to ſhew them the money, in order to gain me credit for a bed and what little neceſſaries I ſhould want, till I ſhould be in a condition to be got to the hoſpital—Come then! ſaid ſhe, tying up the little purſe,—I'll be your banker—but as that office alone will not keep me employ'd, I'll be your nurſe too.</p>
            <p>I thought by her manner of ſpeaking this, as well as by her dreſs, which I then began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider more attentively—that the young woman could not be the daughter of the peaſant. She was in black down to her toes, with her hair concealed under a cambrick border, laid cloſe to her forehead: ſhe was one of thoſe kind of Nuns, an' pleaſe your honour, of which your honour knows, there are a good many in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which they let go looſe—By thy deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> I dare ſay ſhe was a young <hi>Beguine,</hi> of which there are none to be found any where but in the <hi>Spaniſh Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>—except at <hi>Amſterdam</hi>—they differ from Nuns in this, that they can quit their cloiſter if
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0523900600:96"/>
they chooſe to marry; they viſit and take care of the ſick by profeſſion—I had rather, for my own part, they did it out of good-nature.</p>
            <p>The young <hi>Beguine,</hi> continued the Corporal, had ſcarce given herſelf time to tell me "ſhe would be my nurſe," when ſhe haſtily turned about to begin the office of one, and prepare ſomething for me—and in a ſhort time—though I thought it a long one—ſhe came back with flannels, &amp;c. &amp;c. and having fomented my knee ſoundly for a couple of hours, and made me a thin baſon of gruel for my ſupper—ſhe wiſh'd me reſt, and promiſed to be with me early in the morning.—She wiſh'd me, an' pleaſe your honour, what was not to be had. My fever ran very high that night—her figure made ſad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance within me—I was every moment cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the world in two—to give her half of it—and every moment was I crying, that I had nothing but a knapſack and eighteen florins to ſhare with her—The whole night long was the fair <hi>Beguine,</hi> like an angel, cloſe by my bed ſide, holding back my curtain and offering me cordials—and I was only awakened from my dream by her coming there at the hour promiſed and giving them in reality. In truth, ſhe was
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0523900600:97"/>
ſcarce ever from me, and ſo accuſtomed was I to receive life from her hands, that my heart ſickened, and I loſt colour when ſhe left the room.—Love, an' pleaſe your honour, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly like war, in this; that a ſoldier, though he has eſcaped three weeks complete o' Saturday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night—may nevertheleſs be ſhot through his heart on Sunday morning—it happened ſo here, an' pleaſe your honour, with this difference only—that it was on Sunday in the afternoon, when I fell in love all at once with a ſiſſerara—it burſt upon me, an' pleaſe your honour, like a bomb—ſcarce giving me time to ſay, "God bleſs me."</p>
            <p>I thought <hi>Trim,</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> a man never fell in love ſo very ſuddenly,</p>
            <p>Yes an' pleaſe your honour, if he is in the way of it—replied <hi>Trim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I prithee, quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> inform me how this matter happened.</p>
            <p>—With all pleaſure, ſaid the Corporal, making a bow. I had eſcaped, continued the Corporal, all that time from falling in love, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0523900600:98"/>
had gone on to the end of the chapter, had it not been predeſtined otherwiſe—there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting our fate. It was on a Sunday, in the afternoon, as I told your honour. The old man and his wife had walked out—Every thing was ſtill and huſh as midnight about the houſe—</p>
            <p>There was not ſo much as a duck or a duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about the yard; when the fair <hi>Beguine</hi> came in to ſee me.</p>
            <p>My wound was then in a fair way of doing well—the inflammation had been gone off for ſome time, but it was ſucceeded with an itching both above and below my knee, ſo inſufferable, that I had not ſhut my eyes the whole night for it. Let me ſee it, ſaid ſhe, kneeling down upon the ground parallel to my knee, and laying her hand upon the part below it—it only wants rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing a little, ſaid the <hi>Beguine;</hi> ſo covering it with the bed cloaths, ſhe began with the fore-finger of her right-hand to rub under my knee, guiding her fore-finger backwards and forwards by the edge of the flannel, which kept on the dreſſing.</p>
            <p>In five or ſix minutes I felt ſlightly the end of her ſecond finger—and preſently it was laid
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0523900600:99"/>
flat with the other, and ſhe continued rubbing in that way round and round for a good while; it then came into my head, that I ſhould fall in love—I bluſhed when I ſaw how white a hand ſhe had—I ſhall never, an' pleaſe your honour, behold another hand ſo white whilſt I live.—</p>
            <p>The young <hi>Beguine,</hi> continued the Corporal, perceiving it was of great ſervice to me—from rubbing, for ſome time, with two fingers—proceeded to rub at length with three—till by little and little ſhe brought down the fourth, and then rubbed with her whole hand: I will never ſay another word, an' pleaſe your honour, upon hands again—but is was ſofter than ſatin.—</p>
            <p>Prithee, <hi>Trim,</hi> commend it as much as thou wilt, ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby;</hi> I ſhall hear thy ſtory with the more delight—The Corporal thanked his maſter moſt unfeignedly; but having nothing to ſay upon the <hi>Beguine's</hi> hand but the ſame over again—he proceeded to the effects of it.</p>
            <p>The fair <hi>Beguine,</hi> ſaid the Corporal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued rubbing with her whole hand under my knee,—till I feared her zeal would weary her—"I would do a thouſand times more," ſaid ſhe,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0523900600:100"/>
"for the love of Chriſt." As ſhe continued rubbing—I felt it ſpread from under her hand, an' pleaſe your honour, to every part of my frame.—</p>
            <p>The more ſhe rubbed, and the longer ſtrokes ſhe took—the more the fire kindled in my veins—till at length, by two or three ſtrokes longer than the reſt—my paſſion roſe to the higheſt pitch—I ſeized her hand—And then thou clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped'ſt it to thy lips, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſaid my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi>—and madeſt a ſpeech.</p>
            <p>Whether the Corporal's amour terminated preciſely in the way my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> deſcribed it, is not material; it is enough that it contained in it the eſſence of all the love-romances which ever have been wrote ſince the beginning of the world.</p>

            <p>—THEY were the ſweeteſt notes I ever heard; and I inſtantly let down the fore-glaſs to hear them more diſtinctly—'Tis <hi>Maria;</hi> ſaid the poſtillion, obſerving I was liſtening—Poor <hi>Maria,</hi> continued he, (leaning his body on one ſide to let me ſee her, for he was in a line betwixt us), is ſitting upon a bank playing her veſpers upon her pipe, with her little goat beſide her.</p>
            <p>The young fellow utter'd this with an accent and a look ſo perfectly in tune to a feeling heart, that I inſtantly made a vow, I would give him a four-and-twenty ſous piece, when I got to <hi>Moulines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And who is <hi>poor Maria?</hi> ſaid I.</p>
            <p>The love and pity of all the villages around us; ſaid the poſtillion—it is but three years ago, that the ſun did not ſhine upon ſo fair, ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted and amiable a maid; and better fate
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0523900600:102"/>
did <hi>Maria</hi> deſerve, than to have her Banns for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid by the intrigues of the curate of the pariſh who publiſhed them—</p>
            <p>He was going on, when <hi>Maria,</hi> who had made a ſhort pauſe, put the pipe to her mouth, and began the air again—they were the ſame notes;—yet were ten times ſweeter: It is the evening ſervice to the Virgin, ſaid the young man—but who has taught her to play it—or how ſhe came by her pipe, no one knows; we think that heaven has aſſiſted her in both; for ever ſince ſhe has been unſettled in her mind, it ſeems her only conſolation—ſhe has never once had the pipe out of her hand, but plays that <hi>ſervice</hi> upon it almoſt night and day.</p>
            <p>The poſtillion delivered this with ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and natural eloquence, that I could not help decyphering ſomething in his face above his condition, and ſhould have ſifted out his hiſtory, had not poor <hi>Maria's</hi> taken ſuch full poſſeſſion of me.</p>
            <p>We had got up by this time almoſt to the bank where <hi>Maria</hi> was ſitting; ſhe was in a thin white jacket, with her hair, all but two
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0523900600:103"/>
treſſes, drawn up into a ſilk net, with a few olive leaves twiſted a little fantaſtically on one ſide—ſhe was beautiful; and if ever I felt the full force of an honeſt heart-ache, it was the moment I ſaw her—</p>
            <p>—God help her! poor damſel! above a hundred maſſes, ſaid the poſtillion, have been ſaid in the ſeveral pariſh churches and convents around, for her,—but without effect; we have ſtill hopes, as ſhe is ſenſible for ſhort intervals, that the Virgin at laſt will reſtore her to herſelf; but her parents who know her beſt, are hopeleſs upon that ſcore, and think her ſenſes are loſt for ever.</p>
            <p>As the poſtillion ſpoke this, <hi>Maria</hi> made a cadence ſo melancholy, ſo tender and querulous, that I ſprung out of the chaiſe to help her, and found myſelf ſitting betwixt her and her goat before I relapſed from my enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maria</hi> look'd wiſtfully for ſome time at me, and then at her goat—and then at me—and then at her goat again, and ſo on, alternately—</p>

I do entreat the candid reader to believe me, that it was from the humbleſt conviction of what a <hi>Beaſt</hi> man is,—that I aſk'd the queſtion; and that I would not have let fallen an unſeaſonable pleaſantry in the venerable preſence of Miſery, to be entitled to all the wit that ever <hi>Rabelais</hi> ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered—and yet I own my heart ſmote me, and that I ſo ſmarted at the very idea of it, that I ſwore I would ſet up for wiſdom, and utter grave ſentences the reſt of my days—and never—never attempt again to commit mirth with man, woman, or child, the longeſt day I had to live.</p>
            <p>As for writing nonſenſe to them—I believe, there was a reſerve—but that I leave to the world.</p>
            <p>Adieu, <hi>Maria!</hi>—adieu, poor hapleſs damſel! ſome time, but not <hi>now,</hi> I may hear thy ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows from thy own lips—but I was deceived; for that moment ſhe took her pipe and told me ſuch a tale of woe with it, that I roſe up, and with broken and irregular ſteps walk'd ſoftly to my chaiſe.</p>

            <p>MOULINES.</p>
            <p>I NEVER felt what the diſtreſs of plenty was in any one ſhape till now—to travel it through the <hi>Bourbonnois,</hi> the ſweeteſt part of <hi>France</hi>—in the hey-day of the vintage, when Nature is pouring her abundance into every one's lap, and every eye is lifted up—a journey through each ſtep of which muſic beats time to <hi>Labour,</hi> and all her children are rejoicing as they carry in their cluſters—to paſs through this with my affections flying out, and kindling at every group before me—and every one of them was pregnant with adventures.</p>
            <p>Juſt heaven!—it would fill up twenty volumes—and alas! I have but a few ſmall pages left of this to crowd it into—and half of theſe muſt be taken up with the poor <hi>Maria</hi> my friend Mr. <hi>Shandy</hi> met with near <hi>Moulines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſtory he had told of that diſordered maid affected me not a little in the reading; but when
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0523900600:106"/>
I got within the neighbourhood where ſhe lived, it returned ſo ſtrong into my mind, that I could not reſiſt an impulſe which prompted me to go half a league out of the road, to the village where her parents dwelt, to enquire after her.</p>
            <p>'Tis going, I own, like the knight of the Woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Countenance, in queſt of melancholy adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures—but I know not how it is, but I am never ſo perfectly conſcious of the exiſtence of a ſoul within me, as when I am entangled in them.</p>
            <p>The old mother came to the door, her looks told me the ſtory before ſhe opened her mouth—She had loſt her huſband: he had died, ſhe ſaid, of anguiſh, for the loſs of <hi>Maria's</hi> ſenſes, about a month before—She had feared at firſt, ſhe added, that it would have plundered her poor girl of what little underſtanding was left—but, on the contrary, it had brought her more to herſelf—ſtill ſhe could not reſt—her poor daughter, ſhe ſaid, crying, was wandering ſomewhere about the road—</p>
            <p>—Why does my pulſe beat languid as I write this? and what made <hi>La Fleur,</hi> whoſe heart
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0523900600:107"/>
ſeemed only to be tun'd to joy, to paſs the back of his hand twice acroſs his eyes, as the woman ſtood and told it? I beckoned to the poſtillion to turn back into the road.</p>
            <p>When we had got within half a league of <hi>Moulines,</hi> at a little opening in the road leading to a thicket, I diſcovered poor <hi>Maria</hi> ſitting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a poplar—ſhe was ſitting with her elbow in her lap, and her head leaning on one ſide within her hand—a ſmall brook ran at the foot of the tree.</p>
            <p>I bid the poſtillion go on with the chaiſe to <hi>Moulines</hi>—and <hi>La Fleur</hi> to beſpeak my ſupper—and that I would walk after him.</p>
            <p>She was dreſſed in white, and much as my friend deſcribed her, except that her hair hung looſe, which before was twiſted within a ſilk-net.—She had, ſuperadded likewiſe to her jacket, a pale green riband, which fell acroſs her ſhoulder to the waiſt; at the end of which hung her pipe.—Her goat had been as faithleſs as her lover; and ſhe had got a little dog in lieu of him, which ſhe had kept tied by a ſtring to her girdle; as I looked at her dog, ſhe drew him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0523900600:108"/>
her with the ſtring—"Thou ſhalt not leave me, <hi>Sylvio,</hi>" ſaid ſhe. I looked in <hi>Maria's</hi> eyes, and ſaw ſhe was thinking more of her father than of her lover or her little goat; for as ſhe uttered them the tears trickled down her cheeks.</p>
            <p>I ſat down cloſe by her; and <hi>Maria</hi> let me wipe them away as they fell, with my handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.—I then ſteep'd it in my own—and then in hers—and then in mine—and then I wip'd hers again—and as I did it, I ſelt ſuch undeſcribable emotions within me, as I am ſure could not be accounted for from any combinations of matter and motion.</p>
            <p>I am poſitive I have a ſoul; nor can all the books with which materialiſts have peſtered the world ever convince me to the contrary.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Maria</hi> had come a little to herſelf, I aſked her if ſhe remembered a pale thin perſon of a man who had ſat down betwixt her and her goat about two years before? She ſaid, ſhe was unſettled much at that time, but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered it upon two accounts—that ill as ſhe was, ſhe ſaw the perſon pitied her; and next, that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0523900600:109"/>
her goat had ſtolen his handkerchief, and ſhe had beat him for the theft—ſhe had waſh'd it, ſhe ſaid, in the brook, and kept it ever ſince in her pocket to reſtore it to him in caſe ſhe ſhould ever ſee him again, which, ſhe added, he had half promiſed her. As ſhe told me this, ſhe took the handkerchief out of her pocket to let me ſee it; ſhe had folded it up neatly in a couple of vine leaves, tied round with a tendril—on opening it, I ſaw an S mark'd in one of the corners.</p>
            <p>She had ſince that, ſhe told me, ſtray'd as far as <hi>Rome,</hi> and walk'd round St. <hi>Peter's</hi> once—and return'd back—that ſhe found her way alone acroſs the <hi>Apennines</hi>—had travell'd over all <hi>Lombardy</hi> without money—and through the flinty roads of <hi>Savoy</hi> without ſhoes—how ſhe had borne it, and how ſhe had got ſupported, ſhe could not tell—but <hi>God tempers the wind,</hi> ſaid <hi>Maria, to the ſhorn lamb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shorn indeed! and to the quick, ſaid I; and waſt thou in my own land, where I have a cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, I would take thee to it and ſhelter thee: thou ſhouldſt eat of my own bread, and drink of my own cup—I would be kind to thy <hi>Sylvio</hi>—in all thy weakneſſes and wanderings I
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0523900600:110"/>
would ſeek after thee and bring thee back—when the ſun went down I would ſay my prayers; and when I had done thou ſhouldſt play thy even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſong upon thy pipe, nor would the incenſe of my ſacrifice be worſe accepted for entering heaven along with that of a broken heart.</p>
            <p>Nature melted within me, as I utter'd this; and <hi>Maria</hi> obſerving, as I took out my handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, that it was ſteep'd too much already to be of uſe, would needs go waſh it in the ſtream—and where will you dry it, <hi>Maria?</hi> ſaid I—I will dry it in my boſom, ſaid ſhe—'twill do me good.</p>
            <p>And is your heart ſtill ſo warm, <hi>Maria?</hi> ſaid I.</p>
            <p>I touch'd upon the ſtring on which hung all her ſorrows—ſhe look'd with wiſtful diſorder for ſometime in my face; and then, without ſaying any thing, took her pipe, and play'd her ſervice to the Virgin—The ſtring I had touch'd ceaſed to vibrate—in a moment or two <hi>Maria</hi> returned to herſelf—let her pipe fall—and roſe up.</p>
            <p>And where are you going, <hi>Maria?</hi> ſaid I.—She ſaid, to <hi>Moulines.</hi>—Let us go, ſaid I, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—<hi>Maria</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0523900600:111"/>
put her arm within mine, and lengthening the ſtring, to let the dog follow—in that order we entered <hi>Moulines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though I hate ſalutations and greetings in the market-place, yet when we got into the middle of this, I ſtopp'd to take my laſt look and laſt farewell of <hi>Maria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maria,</hi> though not tall, was nevertheleſs of the firſt order of fine forms—affliction had touch'd her looks with ſomething that was ſcarce earthly—ſtill ſhe was feminine—and ſo much was there about her of all that the heart wiſhes, or the eye looks for in woman, that could the traces be ever worn out of her brain, and thoſe of <hi>Eliza's</hi> out of mine, ſhe ſhould <hi>not only eat of my bread and drink of my own cup,</hi> but <hi>Maria</hi> ſhould lie in my boſom, and be unto me as a daughter.</p>
            <p>Adieu, poor luckleſs maiden!—imbibe the oil and wine which the compaſſion of a ſtranger, as he journeyeth on his way, now pours into thy wounds—the Being who has twice bruiſed thee can only bind them up for ever.</p>

            <head>THE SUPPER.</head>
            <p>A SHOE coming looſe from the fore-foot of the thill-horſe, at the beginning of the aſcent of mount <hi>Taurira,</hi> the poſtillion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, twiſted the ſhoe off, and put it in his pocket; as the aſcent was of five or ſix miles, and that horſe our main dependence, I made a point of having the ſhoe faſten'd on again, as well as we could; but the poſtillion had thrown away the nails, and the hammer in the chaiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0523900600:114"/>
being of no great uſe without them, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to go on.</p>
            <p>He had not mounted half a mile higher, when coming to a flinty piece of road, the poor devil loſt a ſecond ſhoe, and from off his other fore-foot; I then got out of the chaiſe in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; and ſeeing a houſe about a quarter of a mile to the left-hand, with a great deal to do, I prevailed upon the poſtillion to turn up to it. The look of the houſe, and of every thing about it, as we drew nearer, ſoon reconciled me to the diſaſter.—It was a little farm-houſe ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with about twenty acres of vineyard, about as much corn—and cloſe to the houſe, on one ſide, was a <hi>potagerie</hi> of an acre and a half full of every thing which could make plenty in a <hi>French</hi> peaſant's houſe—and on the other ſide was a little wood which furniſhed wherewithal to dreſs it. It was about eight in the evening when I got to the houſe—ſo I left the poſtillion to manage his point as he could—and for mine, I walk'd directly into the houſe.</p>
            <p>The family conſiſted of an old grey-headed man and his wife, with five or ſix ſons and ſons-in-law and their ſeveral wives, and a joyous ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy out of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0523900600:115"/>
They were all ſitting down together to their lentil-ſoup; a large wheaten loaf was in the middle of the table; and a flaggon of wine at each end of it promiſed joy thro' the ſtages of the repaſt—'twas a feaſt of love.</p>
            <p>The old man roſe up to meet me, and with a reſpectful cordiality would have me ſit down at the table; my heart was ſet down the moment I entered the room; ſo I ſat down at once like a ſon of the family; and to inveſt myſelf in the character as ſpeedily as I could, I inſtantly bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed the old man's knife, and taking up the loaf, cut myſelf a hearty luncheon; and as I did it, I ſaw a teſtimony in every eye, not only of an honeſt welcome, but of a welcome mix'd with thanks that I had not ſeem'd to doubt it.</p>
            <p>Was it this; or tell me, Nature, what elſe it was that made this morſel ſo ſweet—and to what magic I owe it, that the draught I took of their flaggon was ſo delicious with it, that they remain upon my palate to this hour?</p>
            <p>If the ſupper was to my taſte—the grace which followed it was much more ſo.</p>

            <head>THE GRACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN ſupper was over, the old man gave a knock upon the table with the haft of his knife, to bid them prepare for the dance: the moment the ſignal was given, the women and girls ran all together into the back apartment to tie up their hair—and the young men to the door to waſh their faces, and change their ſabots; and in three minutes every ſoul was ready upon a little eſplanade before the houſe to begin—The old man and his wife came out laſt, and placing me betwixt them, ſat down upon a ſopha of turf by the door.</p>
            <p>The old man had ſome fifty years ago been no mean performer upon the vielle—and, at the age he was then of, touched it well enough for the purpoſe. His wife ſung now-and-then a little to the tune—then intermitted—and joined her old man again, as their children and grand-chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren danced before them.</p>
            <p>It was not till the middle of the ſecond dance, when for ſome pauſes in the movement where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

they all ſeem'd to look up, I fancied I could diſtinguiſh an elevation of ſpirit different from that which is the cauſe or the effect of ſimple jollity.—In a word, I thought I beheld <hi>Religion</hi> mixing in the dance—but as I had never ſeen her ſo engaged, I ſhould have look'd upon it now as one of the illuſions of an imagination which is eternally miſleading me, had not the old man, as ſoon as the dance ended, ſaid, that this was their conſtant way; and that all his life long he made it a rule, after ſupper was over, to call out his family to dance and rejoice; believing, he ſaid, that a cheerful and contented mind was the beſt ſort of thanks to heaven that an illiterate peaſant could pay—</p>

            <p>IT was Sunday; and when <hi>La Fleur</hi> came in the morning, with my coffee and roll and butter, he had got himſelf ſo gallantly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray'd, I ſcarce knew him.</p>
            <p>I had covenanted at <hi>Montriul</hi> to give him a new hat with a ſilver button and loop, and four Louis d'ors <hi>pour s'adoniſer,</hi> when we got to Paris; and the poor fellow, to do him juſtice, had done wonders with it.</p>
            <p>He had bought a bright, clean, good ſcarlet coat, and a pair of breeches of the ſame—They were not a crown worſe, he ſaid, for the wearing—I wiſh'd him hang'd for telling me—They look'd ſo freſh, that though I knew the thing could not be done, yet I would rather have impoſed upon my fancy with thinking I had bought them new for the fellow, than that they had come out of the <hi>Rue de Friperie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a nicety which makes not the heart ſore at <hi>Paris.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0523900600:121"/>
He had purchaſed moreover a handſome blue ſattin waiſtcoat, fancifully enough embroidered—this was indeed ſomething the worſe for the ſervice it had done, but 't was clean ſcour'd—the gold had been touch'd up, and upon the whole was rather ſhowy than otherwiſe—and as the blue was not violent, it ſuited with the coat and breeches very well: he had ſqueez'd out of the money, moreover, a new bag and a ſolitaire; and had inſiſted with the <hi>Fripier,</hi> upon a gold pair of garters to his breeches knees—He had purchaſed muſlin ruffles, <hi>bien brodées,</hi> with four livres of his own money,—and a pair of white ſilk ſtockings for five more—and, to top all, nature had given him a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome figure, without coſting him a ſous.</p>
            <p>He entered the room thus ſet off, with his hair dreſt in the firſt ſtile, and with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <hi>bouquet</hi> in his breaſt—in a word, there was that look of feſtivity in every thing about him, which at once put me in mind it was Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day—and by combining both together, it inſtantly ſtruck me, that the favour he wiſh'd to aſk of me the night before, was to ſpend the day as every body in <hi>Paris</hi> ſpent it beſides.

            <head>THE MONK.</head>
            <p>CALAIS.</p>
            <p>A POOR monk of the order of St. Francis came into the room to beg ſomething for his Convent. No man cares to have his virtues the ſport of contingencies—or one man may be generous as another man is puiſſant—<hi>ſed non, quo ad hanc</hi>—or be it as it may—for there is no regular reaſoning upon the ebbs and flows of our humours; they may depend upon the ſame cauſes, for aught I know, which influence the tides themſelves—'twould oft be no diſcredit to us, to ſuppoſe it was ſo: I'm ſure at leaſt for myſelf, that in many a caſe I ſhould be more highly ſatisfied, to have it ſaid by the world, "I had had an affair with the moon, in which there was neither ſin nor ſhame," than have it paſs altogether as my own act and deed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was ſo much of both.</p>
            <p>—But be this as it may: The moment I caſt my eyes upon him, I was predetermined not to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0523900600:125"/>
give him a ſingle ſous, and accordingly I put my purſe into my pocket—button'd it up—ſet my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a little more upon my centre, and advanced up gravely to him: there was ſomething, I fear, forbidding in my look: I have his figure this moment before my eyes, and think there was that in it which deſerved better.</p>
            <p>The monk, as I judged from the break in his tonſure, a few ſcatter'd white hairs upon his temples, being all that remained of it, might be about ſeventy—but from his eyes, and that ſort of fire that was in them, which ſeemed more temper'd by courteſy than years, could be no more than ſixty—Truth might lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween—He was certainly ſixty-five; and the general air of his countenance, notwithſtanding ſomething ſeemed to have been planting wrinkles in it before their time, agreed to the account.</p>
            <p>It was one of thoſe heads, which Guido has often painted—mild, pale—penetrating, free from all common-place ideas of fat contented ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance looking downwards upon the earth—it look'd forwards; but look'd, as if it look'd at ſomething beyond this world. How one of his order came by it, heaven above, who let it fall
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0523900600:126"/>
upon a monk's ſhoulders, beſt knows: but it would have ſuited a Bramin, and had I met it upon the plains of Indoſtan, I had reverenced it.</p>
            <p>The reſt of his outline may be given in a few ſtrokes; one might put it into the hands of any one to deſign, for 'twas neither elegant or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but as character and expreſſion made it ſo: it was a thin, ſpare form, ſomething above the common ſize, if it loſt not the diſtinction by a bend forward in the figure—but it was the atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Intreaty; and as it now ſtands preſent to my imagination, it gain'd more than it loſt by it.</p>
            <p>When he had entered the room three paces, he ſtood ſtill; and laying his left hand upon his breaſt, (a ſlender white ſtaff with which he jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney'd being in his right)—when I had got cloſe up to him, he introduced himſelf with the little ſtory of the wants of his convent, and the pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his order—and did it with ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a grace—and ſuch an air of deprecation was there in the whole caſt of his look and figure—I was bewitch'd not to have been ſtruck with it.</p>
            <p>—A better reaſon was, I had predetermined not to give him a ſingle ſous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0523900600:127"/>
—'Tis very true, ſaid I, replying to a caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with his eyes, with which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his addreſs—'tis very true—and heaven be their reſource who have no other but the charity of the world, the ſtock of which, I fear, is no way ſufficient for the many <hi>great claims</hi> which are hourly made upon it.</p>
            <p>As I pronounced the words <hi>great claims,</hi> he gave a ſlight glance with his eye downwards upon the ſleeve of his tunick—I felt the full force of the appeal—I acknowledge it, ſaid I,—a coarſe habit, and that but once in three years with meagre diet—are no great matters: and the true point of pity is, as they can be earn'd in the world with ſo little induſtry, that your order ſhould wiſh to procure them by preſſing upon a fund which is the property of the lame, the blind, the aged, and the infirm—the captive who lies down counting over and over again the days of his afflictions, languiſhes alſo for his ſhare of it; and had you been of the <hi>order of Mercy,</hi> inſtead of the order of St. Francis, poor as I am, continued I, pointing at my portman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau, full cheerfully ſhould it have been open'd to you, for the ranſom of the unfortunate—The monk made me a bow—but of all others, reſumed I, the unfortunate of our own country, ſurely,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0523900600:128"/>
have the firſt rights; and I have left thouſands in diſtreſs upon our own ſhore—The monk gave a cordial wave with his head—as much as to ſay, No doubt, there is miſery enough in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the world, as well as within our convent—But we diſtinguiſh, ſaid I, laying my hand upon the ſleeve of his tunick, in return for his appeal—we diſtinguiſh, my good father! betwixt thoſe who wiſh only to eat the bread of their own labour—and thoſe who eat the bread of other people's, and have no other plan in life, but to get through it in ſloth and ignorance, <hi>for the love of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The poor Franciſcan made no reply: a hectic of a moment paſs'd acroſs his cheek, but could not tarry—Nature ſeemed to have had done with her reſentments in him; he ſhewed none—but letting his ſtaff fall within his arm, he preſs'd both his hands with reſignation upon his breaſt, and retired.</p>
            <p>My heart ſmote me the moment he ſhut the door—Pſha! ſaid I, with an air of careleſſneſs, three ſeveral times—but it would not do: every ungracious ſyllable I had utter'd, crouded back into my imagination: I reflected, I had no right over the poor Franciſcan, but to deny him; and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0523900600:129"/>
that the puniſhment of that was enough to the diſſappointed, without the addition of unkind language—I conſider'd his grey hairs—his courteous figure ſeem'd to re-enter and gently aſk me what injury he had done me?—and why I could uſe him thus?—I would have given twenty livres for an advocate—I have behaved very ill, ſaid I within myſelf; but I have only juſt ſet out upon my travels; and ſhall learn better manners as I get along.</p>

            <head>THE MONK.</head>
            <p>THE good old monk was within ſix paces of us, as the idea of him croſs'd my mind; and was advancing towards us a little out of the line, as if uncertain whether he ſhould break in upon us or no.—He ſtopp'd, however, as ſoon as he came up to us, with a world of frankneſs; and having a horn ſnuff-box in his hand, he preſented it open to me—You ſhall taſte mine—ſaid I, pulling out my box (which was a ſmall tortoiſe one) and putting it into his hand—'Tis moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, ſaid the monk: Then do me the favour, I replied, to accept of the box and all, and when you take a pinch out of it, ſometimes recollect
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0523900600:130"/>
it was the peace-offering of a man who once uſed you unkindly, but not from his heart.</p>
            <p>The poor monk bluſh'd as red as ſcarlet. <hi>Mon Dieu!</hi> ſaid he, preſſing his hands together—you never uſed me unkindly.—I ſhould think, ſaid the lady, he is not likely. I bluſh'd in my turn; but from what movements, I leave to the few who feel to analyſe—Excuſe me, Madame, replied I—I treated him moſt unkindly; and from no provocations. 'Tis impoſſible ſaid the lady.—My God! cried the monk, with a warmth of aſſeveration which ſeem'd not to belong to him—the fault was in me, and in the indiſcretion of my zeal—the lady oppoſed it, and I joined with her in maintaining it was impoſſible, that a ſpirit ſo regulated as his, could give offence to any.</p>
            <p>I knew not that contention could be rendered ſo ſweet and pleaſurable a thing to the nerves as I then felt it.—We remained ſilent, without any ſenſation of that fooliſh pain which takes place, when in ſuch a circle you look for ten minutes in one another's faces without ſaying a word. Whilſt this laſted, the monk rubb'd his horn-box upon the ſleeve of his tunick; and as ſoon as it had acquired a little air of brightneſs by the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0523900600:131"/>
friction—he made a low bow, and ſaid 'twas too late to ſay whether it was the weakneſs or goodneſs of our tempers which had involved us in this conteſt—but be it as it would—he begg'd we might exchange boxes—In ſaying this he preſented his to me with one hand, as he took mine from me in the other: and having kiſs'd it—with a ſtream of good-nature in his eyes, he put it into his boſom—and took his leave.</p>
            <p>I guard this box as I would the inſtrumental parts of my religion, to help my mind on to ſomething better: in truth, I ſeldom go abroad without it; and oft and many a time have I called up by it the courteous ſpirit of its owner to regulate my own, in the juſtlings of the world; they had found full employment for his, as I learnt from his ſtory, till about the forty-fifth year of his age, when upon ſome military ſervices ill requited, and meeting at the ſame time with a diſappointment in the tendereſt of paſſions, he abandoned the ſword and the ſex to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and took ſanctuary, not ſo much in his convent as in himſelf.</p>
            <p>I feel a damp upon my ſpirits, as I am going to add, that in my laſt return through Calais,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0523900600:132"/>
upon inquiring after Father Lorenzo, I heard he had been dead near three months, and was buried, not in his convent, but, according to his deſire, in a little cemetery belonging to it, about two leagues off: I had a ſtrong deſire to ſee where they had laid him—when upon pulling out his little horn box, as I ſat by his grave, and plucking up a nettle or two at the head of it, which had no buſineſs to grow there, they all ſtruck together ſo forcibly upon my affections, that I burſt into a flood of tears—but I am as weak as a woman; and I beg the world not to ſmile, but pity me.</p>

            <p>THERE is ſomething in our nature which engages us to take part in every accident to which man is ſubject, from what cauſe ſoever it may have happened; but in ſuch calamities as a man has fallen into through mere misfortune, to be charged upon no fault or indiſcretion of himſelf, there is ſomething then ſo truly intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that at the firſt ſight we generally make them our own, not altogether from a reflection
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0523900600:133"/>
that they might have been or may be ſo, but oftener from a certain generoſity and tenderneſs of nature which diſpoſes us for compaſſion, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from all conſiderations of ſelf: ſo that without any obſervable act of the will, we ſuffer with the unfortunate, and feel a weight upon our ſpirits we know not why, on ſeeing the moſt common inſtances of their diſtreſs. But where the ſpectacle is uncommonly tragical, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with many circumſtances of miſery, the mind is then taken captive at once, and <hi>were</hi> it inclined to it, has no power to make reſiſtance, but ſurrenders itſelf to all the tender emotions of pity and deep concern. So that when one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders this friendly part of our nature without looking farther, one would think it impoſſible for man to look upon miſery without finding himſelf in ſome meaſure attached to the intereſt of him who ſuffers it—I ſay, one would think it impoſſible—for there are ſome tempers—how ſhall I deſcribe them?—formed either of ſuch impenetrable matter, or wrought up by habitual ſelfiſhneſs to ſuch an utter inſenſibility of what becomes of the fortunes of their fellow creatures, as if they were not partakers of the ſame nature, or had no lot or connection at all with the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>

            <p>OF the many revengeful, covetous, falſe, and ill-natured perſons which we complain of in the world, though we all join in the cry againſt them, what man amongſt us ſingles out himſelf as a criminal, or ever once takes it into his head that he adds to the number?—or where is there a man ſo bad, who would not think it the hardeſt and moſt unfair imputation, to have any of thoſe particular vices laid to his charge?</p>
            <p>If he has the ſymptoms never ſo ſtrong upon him, which he would pronounce infallible in another, they are indications of no ſuch malady in himſelf—he ſees what no one elſe ſees, ſome ſecret and flattering circumſtances in his favour, which no doubt make a wide difference betwixt his caſe, and the parties which he condemns.</p>

            <head>HOUSE OF MOURNING.</head>
            <p>LET us go into the houſe of mourning, made ſo by ſuch afflictions as have been brought in, merely by the common croſs accidents and diſaſters to which our condition is expoſed,—where, perhaps, the aged parents ſit broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, pierced to their ſouls with the folly and indiſcretion of a thankleſs child—the child of their prayers, in whom all their hopes and expectations centered:—perhaps a more affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcene—a virtuous family lying pinched with want, where the unfortunate ſupport of it
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0523900600:138"/>
having long ſtruggled with a train of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and bravely fought up againſt them,—is now piteouſly borne down at the laſt—over-whelmed with a cruel blow which no forecaſt or frugality could have prevented.—O God! look upon his afflictions—behold him diſtracted with many ſorrows, ſurrounded with the tender pledges of his love, and the partner of his cares—without bread to give them, unable, from the remembrance of better days, to dig;—to beg, aſhamed.</p>
            <p>When we enter into the houſe of mourning ſuch as this—it is impoſſible to inſult the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate even with an improper look—under whatever levity and diſſipation of heart, ſuch objects catch our eyes,—they catch likewiſe our attentions, collect and call home our ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered thoughts, and exerciſe them with wiſdom. A tranſient ſcene of diſtreſs, ſuch as is here ſketched, how ſoon does it furniſh materials to ſet the mind at work? how neceſſarily does it engage it to the conſideration of the miſeries and misfortunes, the dangers and calamities to which the life of man is ſubject? By holding up ſuch a glaſs before it, it forces the mind to ſee and reflect upon the vanity,—the periſhing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0523900600:139"/>
condition and uncertain tenure of every thing in this world. From reflections of this ſerious caſt, how inſenſibly do the thoughts carry us farther?—and from conſidering what we are—what kind of world we live in, and what evils befal us in it, how naturally do they ſet us to look forwards at what poſſibly we ſhall be?—for what kind of world we are intended—what evils may befal us there—and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion we ſhould make againſt them here, whilſt we have time and opportunity. If theſe leſſons are ſo inſeparable from the houſe of mourning here ſuppoſed—we ſhall find it a ſtill more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive ſchool of wiſdom when we take a view of the place in that more affecting light in which the wiſe man ſeems to confine it in the text, in which, by the houſe of mourning, I believe, he means that particular ſcene of ſorrow, where there is lamentation and mourning for the dead. Turn in hither, I beſeech you, for a moment. Behold a dead man ready to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out, the only ſon of his mother, and ſhe a widow. Perhaps a more affecting ſpectacle a kind and indulgent father of a numerous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, lies breathleſs—ſnatched away in the ſtrength of his age—torn in an evil hour from his children and the boſom of a diſconſolate
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0523900600:140"/>
wife. Behold much people of the city gathered together to mix their tears, with ſettled ſorrow in their looks, going heavily along to the houſe of mourning, to perform that laſt melancholy office, which, when the debt of nature is paid, we are called upon to pay to each other. If this ſad occaſion which leads him there, has not done it already, take notice, to what a ſerious and devout frame of mind every man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, the moment he enters this gate of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The buſy and fluttering ſpirits, which in the houſe of mirth were wont to tranſport him from one diverting object to another—ſee how they are fallen! how peaceably they are laid! In this gloomy manſion full of ſhades and uncomfortable damps to ſieze the ſoul—ſee, the light and eaſy heart, which never knew what it was to think before, how penſive it is now, how ſoft, how ſuſceptible, how full of religious impreſſions, how deeply it is ſmitten with ſenſe and with a love of virtue. Could we, in this criſis, whilſt this empire of reaſon and religion laſts, and the heart is thus exerciſed with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and buſied with heavenly contemplations—could we ſee it naked as it is—ſtripped of its paſſions, unſpotted by the world, and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of its pleaſures—we might then ſafely reſt

            <p>AND this, ſaid he, putting the remains of a cruſt into his wallet—and this ſhould have been thy portion, ſaid he, hadſt thou been alive to have ſhared it with me. I thought by the accent, it had been an apoſtrophe to his child; but 'twas to his aſs, and to the very aſs we had ſeen dead in the road, which had occaſioned <hi>La Fleur's</hi> miſadventure. The man ſeemed to lament it much; and it inſtantly brought into my mind <hi>Sancho's</hi> lamentation for his; but he did it with more true touches of nature.</p>
            <p>The mourner was ſitting upon a ſtone-bench at the door, with the aſs's pannel and its bridle on one ſide, which he took up from time to time—then laid them down—look'd at them—
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0523900600:144"/>
and ſhook his head. He then took his cruſt of bread out of his wallet again, as if to eat it? held it ſome time in his hand—then laid it upon the bit of his aſs's bridle—look'd wiſtfully at the little arrangement he had made—and then gave a ſigh.</p>
            <p>The ſimplicity of his grief drew numbers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and <hi>La Fleur</hi> amongſt the reſt, whilſt the horſes were getting ready; as I continued ſitting in the poſt-chaiſe, I could ſee and hear over their heads.</p>
            <p>—He ſaid he had come laſt from Spain, where he had been from the furtheſt borders of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia;</hi> and had got ſo far on his return home, when his aſs died. Every one ſeem'd deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know what buſineſs could have taken ſo old and poor a man ſo far a journey from his own home.</p>
            <p>It had pleaſed heaven, he ſaid, to bleſs him with three ſons, the fineſt lads in all Germany; but having in one week loſt two of them by the ſmall-pox, and the youngeſt falling ill of the ſame diſtemper, he was afraid of being bereſt of them all; and made a vow, if heaven would not take
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0523900600:145"/>
him from him alſo, he would go in gratitude to St. <hi>Jago</hi> in Spain,</p>
            <p>When the mourner got thus far on his ſtory, he ſtopp'd to pay nature her tribute—and wept bitterly.</p>
            <p>He ſaid heaven had accepted the conditions, and that he had ſet out from his cottage with this poor creature, who had been a patient part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his journey—that it had eat the ſame bread with him all the way, and was unto him as a friend.</p>
            <p>Every body who ſtood about heard the poor fellow with concern—<hi>La Fleur</hi> offered him money—The mourner ſaid he did not want it—it was not the value of the aſs—but the loſs of him.—The aſs, he ſaid, he was aſſured, loved him—and upon this told them a long ſtory of a miſchance upon their paſſage over the Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean mountains which had ſeparated them from each other three days; during which time the aſs had ſought him as much as he had ſought the aſs, and that they had neither ſcarce eat or drank till they met.</p>

Thou haſt one comfort, friend, ſaid I, at leaſt in the loſs of thy poor beaſt; I'm ſure thou haſt been a merciful maſter to him,—Alas! ſaid the mourner, I thought ſo, when he was alive—but now he is dead I think otherwiſe.—I fear the weight of myſelf and my afflictions together have been too much for him—they have ſhorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the poor creature's days, and I fear I have them to anſwer for.—Shame on the world! ſaid I to myſelf—Did we love each other as this poor ſoul but lov'd his aſs—'twould be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

            <p>Tell me then, my dear brother <hi>Shandy,</hi> upon which of them it is, that when I condemned the peace of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> and grieved the war was not carried on with vigour a little longer, you ſhould think your brother did it upon unworthy views; or that in wiſhing for war, he ſhould be bad enough to wiſh more of his fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſlain,—more ſlaves made, and more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies driven from their peaceful habitations, mere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly for his own pleaſure:—Tell me, brother <hi>Shandy,</hi> upon what one deed of mine do you ground it?</p>

As I darkened the little light he had, he lifted up a hopeleſs eye towards the door, then caſt it down—ſhook his head, and went on with his work of affliction.

and all poſſibility of ſeeing either the ſtage or the actors. The poor dwarf did all he could to get a peep at what was going forwards, by ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſome little opening betwixt the <hi>German's</hi> arm and his body, trying firſt one ſide, then the other; but the <hi>German</hi> ſtood ſquare in the moſt unaccommodating poſture that can be imagined——the dwarf might as well have been placed at the bottom of the deepeſt draw-well in <hi>Paris;</hi> ſo he civilly reach'd up his hand to the <hi>German's</hi> ſleeve, and told him his diſtreſs——The <hi>German</hi> turn'd his head back, look'd down upon him as <hi>Goliah</hi> did upon <hi>David</hi>—and unfeelingly reſumed his poſture.</p>
            <p>I was juſt then taking a pinch of ſnuff out of my monk's little horn box—And how would thy meek and courteous ſpirit, my dear monk! ſo temper'd to <hi>bear and forbear!</hi>—how ſweetly would it have lent an ear to this poor ſoul's complaint!</p>
            <p>The old <hi>French</hi> officer ſeeing me lift up my eyes with an emotion, as I made the apoſtrophe, took the liberty to aſk me what was the matter—I told him the ſtory in three words; and added, how inhuman it was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0523900600:164"/>
By this time the dwarf was driven to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, and in his firſt tranſports, which are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally unreaſonable, had told the <hi>German</hi> he would cut off his long queue with his knife—The <hi>German</hi> look'd back coolly, and told him he was welcome, if he could reach it.</p>
            <p>An injury ſharpened by an inſult, be it to who it will, makes every man of ſentiment a party: I could have leaped out of the box to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed it.—The old <hi>French</hi> officer did it with much leſs confuſion; for leaning a little over, and modding to a centinel, and pointing at the ſame time with his finger to the diſtreſs—the centinel made his way up to it.—There was no occaſion to tell the grievance—the thing told itſelf; ſo thruſting back the <hi>German</hi> inſtantly with his muſket—he took the poor dwarf by the hand, and placed him before him—This is noble! ſaid I, clapping my hands together—And yet you would not permit this, ſaid the old offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>—In <hi>England,</hi> dear Sir, ſaid I, <hi>we ſit all at our eaſe.</hi>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0523900600:165"/>

            <p>WHEN all is ready, and every article is diſputed and paid for in the inn, unleſs you are a little ſour'd by the adventure, there is always a matter to compound at the door, before you can get into your chaiſe, and that is with the ſons and daughters of poverty, who ſurround you. Let no man ſay, "Let them go to the devil"—'tis a cruel journey to ſend a few miſerables, and they have had ſufferings enow without it: I always think it better to take a few ſous out in my hand; and I would counſel every gentle traveller to do ſo likewiſe; he need not be ſo exact in ſetting down his motives for giving them—they will be regiſter'd elſewhere.</p>
            <p>For my own part, there is no man gives ſo little as I do; for few that I know have ſo little to give: but as this was the firſt public act of

            <p>A well-a-way! ſaid I. I have but eight ſous in the world, ſhewing them in my hand, and there are eight poor men and eight poor women for 'em.</p>
            <p>A poor tatter'd ſoul without a ſhirt on, inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withdrew his claim, by retiring two ſteps out of the circle, and making a diſqualifying bow on his part.

            <p>Juſt heaven! for what wiſe reaſons haſt thou order'd it that beggary and urbanity, which are at ſuch variance in other countries, ſhould find a way to be at unity in this?</p>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0523900600:167"/>
took his ſnuff-box out of his pocket, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly offered a pinch on both ſides of him: it was a gift of conſequence and modeſtly declined—The poor little fellow preſs'd it upon them with a nod of welcomeneſs—<hi>Prenez en—Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nez,</hi> ſaid he, looking another way; ſo they each took a pinch—Pity thy box ſhould ever want one! ſaid I to myſelf; ſo I put a couple of ſous into it—taking a ſmall pinch out of his box, to enhance their value, as I did it—He felt the weight of the ſecond obligation more than that of the firſt—'twas doing him an honour—the other was only doing him a charity—and he made me a bow down to the ground for it.</p>
            <p>—Here! ſaid I, to an old ſoldier with one hand, who had been compaign'd and worn out to death in the ſervice—here's a couple of ſous for thee, <hi>Vive le Roi!</hi> ſaid the old ſoldier.</p>
            <p>I had then but three ſous left; ſo I gave one, ſimply <hi>pour l'amour de Dieu,</hi> which was the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on which it was begg'd—The poor woman had a diſlocated hip: ſo it could not be well, upon any other motive.</p>

            <head>HAPPINESS.</head>
            <p>THE great purſuit of man is after happineſs: it is the firſt and ſtrongeſt deſire of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;—in every ſtage of his life, he ſearches for it as for hid treaſure;—courts it under a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand different ſhapes,—and though perpetually diſappointed,—ſtill perſiſts,—runs after and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires for it afreſh—aſks every paſſenger who comes in his way, <hi>Who will ſhew him any good?</hi> who will aſſiſt him in the attainment of it or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him to the diſcovery of this great end of all his wiſhes?</p>
            <p>He is told by one to ſearch for it among the more gay and youthful pleaſures of life, in ſcenes of mirth and ſprightlineſs, where happineſs ever preſides, and is ever to be known by the joy and laughter which he will ſee at once painted in her looks. A ſecond, with a graver aſpect, points
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0523900600:184"/>
out to the coſtly dwellings which pride and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance have erected:—tells the enquirer that the object he is in ſearch of inhabits there,—that happineſs lives only in company with the great, in the midſt of much pomp and outward ſtate. That he will eaſily find her out by the coat of many colours ſhe has on, and the great luxury and expenſe of equipage and furniture with which ſhe always ſits ſurrounded.</p>
            <p>The Miſer bleſſes God!—wonders how any one would miſlead and wilfully put him upon ſo wrong a ſcent—convinces him that happineſs and extravagance never inhabited under the ſame roof;—that if he would not be diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his ſearch, he muſt look into the plain and thrifty dwelling of the prudent man, who knows and underſtands the worth of money, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly lays it up againſt an evil hour: that it is not the proſtitution of wealth upon the paſſions, or the parting with it at all that conſtitutes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs—but that it is the keeping it together, and the <hi>having</hi> and <hi>holding</hi> it faſt to him and his heirs for ever, which are the chief attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes that form this great idol of human wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to which ſo much incenſe is offered up every day.</p>

The Epicure, though he eaſily rectifies ſo groſs a miſtake, yet at the ſame time he plunges him, if poſſible, into a greater; for hearing the object of his purſuit to be happineſs, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of no other happineſs than what is ſeated immediately in his ſenſes—he ſends the enquirer there;—tells him 'tis in vain to ſearch elſewhere for it, than where nature herſelf has placed it—in the indulgence and gratification of the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, which are given us for that end: and in a word—if he will not take his opinion in the matter—he may truſt the word of a much wiſer man, who has aſſured us—that there is nothing better in this world, than that a man ſhould eat and drink and rejoice in his works, and make his ſoul enjoy good in his labour—for that is his portion.</p>
            <p>To reſcue him from this brutal experiment—ambition takes him by the hand and carries him into the world,—ſhews him all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the earth and the glory of them,—points out the many ways of advancing his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and raiſing himſelf to honour,—lays before his eyes all the charms and bewitching tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of power, and aſks if there can be any happineſs in this world like that of being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed, courted, flattered, and followed?</p>

To cloſe all, the philoſopher meets him buſtling in the full career of this purſuit—ſtops him—tells him, if he is in ſearch of happineſs, he is far gone out of his way. That this deity has long been baniſhed from noiſe and tumults, where there was no reſt found for her, and was fled into folitude far from all commerce of the world; and, in a word, if he would find her, he muſt leave this buſy and intriguing ſcene, and go back to that peaceful ſcene of retirement and books, from which he firſt ſet out.</p>
            <p>In this circle too often does a man run, tries all experiments, and generally ſits down wearied and diſſatisfied with them all at laſt—in utter deſpair of ever accompliſhing what he wants—nor knowing what to truſt to after ſo many diſappointments; or where to lay the fault, whether in the incapacity of his own nature, or in the inſufficiency of the enjoyments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

in human affairs, which baffle all our endeavours, and turn aſide the courſe of things in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,—that the moſt likely cauſes diſappoint and fail of producing for us the effect which we wiſhed, and naturally expected from them.</p>
            <p>You will ſee a man, of whom was you to form a conjecture from the appearances of things in his favour,—you would ſay was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out in the world, with the faireſt proſpect of making his fortune in it;—with all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of birth to recommend him,—of perſonal merit to ſpeak for him,—and of friends to puſh him forwards: you will behold him, notwithſtanding this, diſappointed in every effect you might naturally have looked for, from them; every ſtep he takes towards his advancement, ſomething inviſible ſhall pull him back, ſome unforeſeen obſtacle ſhall riſe up perpetually in his way, and keep there.—In eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry application he makes—ſome untoward cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance ſhall blaſt it.—He ſhall riſe early,—late take reſt,—and eat the bread of carefulneſs,—yet ſome happier man ſhall ſtill riſe up, and ever ſtep in before him, and leave him ſtruggling to the end of his life, in the very ſame place in which he firſt began it.</p>

            <p>MAN has a certain compaſs, as well as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument; and the ſocial and other calls have occaſion by turns for every key in him; ſo that if you begin a note too high or too low, there muſt be a want either in the upper or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part, to fill up the ſyſtem of harmony.—A poliſhed nation makes every one its debtor; and beſides, urbanity itſelf, like the fair ſex, has ſo many charms, it goes againſt the heart to ſay it can do ill; and yet, I believe, there is but a certain line of perfection, that man, take him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, is empowered to arrive at—if he gets beyond, he rather exchanges qualities, than gets them. I muſt not preſume to ſay, how far this has affected the French—But ſhould it ever be the caſe of the Engliſh, in the progreſs of their reſentments, to arrive at the ſame poliſh which diſtinguiſhes the French, if we did not loſe the <hi>politeſſe de caeur,</hi> which inclines men more to humane actions, than courteous ones—we ſhould at leaſt loſe that diſtinct variety and originality of character, which diſtinguiſhes

            <head>HUMILITY CONTRASTED WITH PRIDE.</head>
            <p>WHEN we reflect upon the character of Humility,—we are apt to think it ſtands the moſt naked and defenceleſs of all virtues whatever,—the leaſt able to ſupport its claims againſt the inſolent antagoniſt who ſeems ready to bear him down, and all oppoſition which ſuch a temper can make.</p>
            <p>Now, if we conſider him as ſtanding alone,—no doubt, in ſuch a caſe he will be overpowered and trampled upon by his oppoſer;—but if we conſider the meek and lowly man, as he is—fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and guarded by the love, the friendſhip and wiſhes of all mankind,—that the other ſtands alone, hated, diſcountenanced, without one true friend or hearty well-wiſher on his ſide;—when this is balanced, we ſhall have reaſon to change our opinion, and be convinced that the humble man, ſtrengthened with ſuch an alliance, is far
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0523900600:224"/>
from being ſo overmatched as at firſt ſight he may appear;—nay I believe one might venture to go further and engage for it, that in all ſuch caſes, where real fortitude and true perſonal courage were wanted, he is much more likely to give proof of it, and I would ſooner look for it in ſuch a temper than in that of his adverſary. Pride may make a man violent,—but Humility will make him firm:—and which of the two, do you think, likely to come off with honour?—he who acts from the changeable impulſe of heated blood, and follows the uncertain motions of his pride and fury,—or the man who ſtands cool and collected in himſelf; who governs his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiments, inſtead of being governed by them, and on every occaſion acts upon the ſteady mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of principle and duty.</p>
            <bibl>SERMON XXV. P. 193</bibl>
            <p>WITH regard to the provocations and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences which are unavoidably happening to a man in his commerce with the world,—take it as a rule,—as a man's pride is,—ſo is always his diſpleaſure; as the opinion of himſelf riſes,—ſo does the injury,—ſo does his reſentment: 'tis this which gives edge and force to the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which has ſtruck him,—and excites that heat in the wound which renders it incurable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:0523900600:225"/>
See how different the caſe is with the humble man: one half of theſe painful conflicts he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally eſcapes; the other part fall lightly on him:—he provokes no man by contempt; thruſts himſelf forward as the mark of no man's envy; ſo that he cuts off the firſt fretful occaſions of the greateſt part of theſe evils; and for thoſe in which the paſſions of others would involve him, like the humble ſhrub in the valley, gently gives way, and ſcarce feels the injury of thoſe ſtormy encounters which rend the proud cedar, and tear it up by its roots.</p>

Pride is a vice which grows up in ſociety ſo inſenſibly;—ſteals in unobſerved upon the heart upon ſo many occaſions;—forms itſelf upon ſuch ſtrange pretenſions, and when it has done, veils itſelf under ſuch a variety of unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected appearances,—ſometimes even under that of Humility itſelf;—in all which caſes, Self-love, like a falſe friend, inſtead of checking, moſt treacherouſly feeds this humour,—points out ſome excellence in every ſoul to make him vain, and think more highly of himſelf than he ought to think;—that, upon the whole, there is no one weakneſs into which the heart of man is more eaſily betray'd—or which requires greater helps of good ſenſe and good principles to guard againſt.</p>

I cannot help it, <hi>Trim,</hi> my maſter would ſay,—'tis ſo melancholy an accident—I cannot get it off my heart.—Your honour fears not death yourſelf.—I hope, <hi>Trim,</hi> I fear nothing, he would ſay, but the doing a wrong thing.—Well, he would add, whatever betides, I will take care of <hi>Le Fever's</hi> boy.—And with that, like a quieting draught, his honour would ſall aſleep.</p>

ſtept before a platoon. There never was a better officer in the king's army,—or a better man in God's world; for he would march up to the mouth of a cannon, though he ſaw the lighted match at the very touch-hole,—and yet, for all that, he has a heart as ſoft as a child for other people.—He would not hurt a chicken.—I would ſooner, quoth <hi>Jonathan,</hi> drive ſuch a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for ſeven pounds a year—than ſome for eight.—Thank thee, <hi>Jonathan!</hi> for thy twenty ſhillings,—as much, <hi>Jonathan,</hi> ſaid the Corporal, ſhaking him by the hand, as if thou hadſt put the money into my own pocket.—I would ſerve him to the day of my death out of love. He is a friend and a brother to me,—and could I be ſure my poor brother <hi>Tom</hi> was dead,—continued the Corporal, taking out his handkerchief,—was I worth ten thouſand pounds, I would leave every ſhilling of it to the Captain.—<hi>Trim</hi> could not refrain from tears at this teſtamentary proof he gave of his affection to his maſter.—The whole kitchen was affected.</p>

            <head>MR. SHANDY's RESIGNATION FOR THE LOSS OF HIS SON.</head>
            <p>PHILOSOPHY has a fine ſaying for every thing—For <hi>Death</hi> it has an entire ſet.</p>
            <p>"'Tis an inevitable chance—the firſt ſtatute in <hi>Magna Charta</hi>—it is an everlaſting act of parliament—<hi>All muſt die.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"Monarchs and princes dance in the ſame ring with us."</p>
            <p>"—<hi>To die,</hi> is the great debt and tribute due unto nature: tombs and monuments, which ſhould perpetuate our memories, pay it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and the proudeſt pyramid of them all, which wealth and ſcience have erected, has loſt its apex, and ſtands obtruncated in the traveller's horizon.—Kingdoms and provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and towns and cities, have they not their
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0523900600:245"/>
periods? and when thoſe principles and powers, which at firſt cemented and put them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have performed their ſeveral Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they fall back.—"</p>
            <p>"Where is <hi>Troy,</hi> and <hi>Mycenae,</hi> and <hi>Thebes,</hi> and <hi>Delos,</hi> and <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> and <hi>Agrigentum?</hi>—What is become of <hi>Nineveh</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> of <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> and <hi>Mitylenae?</hi> The faireſt towns that ever the ſun roſe upon, are now no more: the names only are left, and thoſe [for many of them are wrong ſpelt] are falling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by piece-meals to decay, and in length of time will be forgotten, and involved with every thing in a perpetual night: the world itſelf—muſt muſt come to an end."</p>
            <p>"Returning out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> when I ſailed from <hi>Aegina</hi> towards <hi>Megara,</hi> I began to view the country round about. <hi>Aegina</hi> was behind me, <hi>Megara</hi> was before, <hi>Pyraeus</hi> on the right hand, <hi>Corinth</hi> on the left.—What flouriſhing towns now proſtrate upon the earth! Alas! alas! ſaid I to myſelf, that man ſhould diſturb his ſoul for the loſs of a child, when ſo much as this lies awfully buried in his preſence.—
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0523900600:246"/>
Remember, ſaid I to myſelf again—remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thou art a man.—"</p>
            <p>"My ſon is dead!—ſo much the better;—'tis a ſhame in ſuch a tempeſt to have but one anchor."</p>
            <p>"But he is gone for ever from us!—be it ſo. He is got from under the hands of his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber before he was bald—he is, but riſen from a feaſt before he was ſurfeited—from a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet before he had got drunken."</p>
            <p>"The <hi>Thracians</hi> wept when a child was born—and feaſted and made merry when a man went out of the world; and with reaſon. Death opens the gate of fame, and ſhuts the gate of envy after it,—it unlooſes the chain of the captive, and puts the bondſman's taſk into another man's hands."</p>
            <p>"Shew me the man, who knows what life is, who dreads it, and I'll ſhew thee a priſoner who dreads his liberty."</p>
