            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N my laſt I told you what furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pretentions were made to Mr. WRIGHT's Favour, by a Set of Fellows, who, you will conclude little deſerve it; and if you conſider that the greateſt part of that Letter was writ before His coming to Town; you will likewiſe agree, that I ſpoke ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like a Prophet.</p>
            <p>But indeed, what is eaſier than to foreſee Things which have ſuch natural and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0147504900:3"/>
Conſequences; for nothing but the groſſeſt Impudence, as well as the moſt abſurd and vain Conceptions, could have given them the leaſt Pretence to it; or have urg'd them to hope what they were neither intituled to, or qualified for.</p>
            <p>They were very officious in their Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on Mr. WRIGHT when he arrived near the Town, and as ſuppliant as Spaniels in their Sycophantick <hi>Devoires.</hi> They feigned and wrung out an hundred Compliments which he took littlenotice of; But of all, you would have laught heartily at <hi>BOB,</hi> with his <hi>INVIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LABLE ATTACH,</hi> and <hi>boaſted Intereſt; BOB</hi> after all was fain to implore the Favour to be introduced; and when he had duck'd himſelf into a low and obſequious Cringe, as he drew near, Mr. WRIGHT by a ſudden Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Mind, turned his back upon him, and poor <hi>BOB</hi>'s Countenance fell like a <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Glaſs</hi> at the Alteration of the Weather.</p>
            <p>This admirable Farce wou'd have laſted much longer, to the great Diverſion of the Town; but that Mr. WRIGHT who is the moſt free and unaffected Man living, and cannot endure any thing that looks like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, or ſervile Flattery, reſolved not to be peſter'd with 'em; and therefore by diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Jacob Ruſh, Sim,</hi> and ſome other of the <hi>King leaders,</hi> deſigned to convince the reſt,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0147504900:4"/>
what he thought of their Company; and that he was capable to diſtinguiſh thoſe who had merited from him, from thoſe who had not.</p>
            <p>You will hardly believe me, when I tell you, that the <hi>CURATE</hi> had the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to appear publickly at the <hi>INN.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Front of that Fellow muſt be of the moſt ſolid and obdurate Braſs. Can it be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got how often he has drank young <hi rend="blackletterType">Shute</hi>'s Health; and preach'd up his Intereſt by Inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendo's, in direct oppoſition to Mr. WRIGHT's Succeſſion? Is any thing more notorious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs his own corrupt Life, than his encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging his Enemies, both in Life and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? How often has he been drunk at the <hi rend="blackletterType">Popes-Head,</hi> the <hi rend="blackletterType">Croſs-Keys,</hi> and <hi rend="blackletterType">Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,</hi> with the Friends of young <hi rend="blackletterType">Shute?</hi> For he promotes no Houſe, that is not even in its very Deſcription well affected to him. Was this a Wretch now to appear bare-faced to Mr. WRIGHT? or can any thing better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the unaccountable Vanity of an unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing termagant Party?</p>
            <p>The Concluſion of this was, that the Wretch was huſtled out of the Houſe, and had been buffeted, but out of deference to his <hi>Coat.</hi> Can you divine now, what ſhould be in the Man's Head? His Friends indeed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their uſual Vanity, ſaid we ſhou'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0147504900:5"/>
ſee him a B—p, but could even the moſt ſtupid <hi>Clodpate</hi> alive, really hope or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, after he ſaw his Confederates under the deplorable Circumſtances of <hi>Diſgrace,</hi> and the <hi>Intereſt</hi> entirely ſunk that could ſupport his unjuſt Pretenſions? Well of all the Sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs furious Creatures that breath in the open Regions of the Air, commend me to the <hi>CURATE</hi> and his Party, for ſomething ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ridiculous, and out of the common Road and Propriety of Thinking.</p>
            <p>A Friend of mine gives a very good turn to this and ſays, it was a Deſign of the Party to ſend him thither on purpoſe to be affronted, thereby to give a ſecond handle to enflame the Mob, as at an Injury or Diſreſpect offered to the <hi>Church;</hi> and this to be ſounded by the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets of Zion</hi> among the People. I will grant for once they may be capable to Think, for there are ſome ſhallow <hi>Trickſters</hi> among them; and therefore my Friends Notion may be juſt; but if ever they are hanged for <hi>Conjurers</hi> I'll be Shot, or throw my ſelf out of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, as an Auſpicious <hi>Patron</hi> of his did, when he remembered the irreparable Injury he had done his Country, by <hi>Charioting</hi> and Countenancing ſuch a pernicious <hi>Incendiary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, the Party have now changed their Sentiments; it is at length beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en into their fortified Skulls; that their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0147504900:6"/>
mighty Pretences to Mr. WRIGHT's Favour were frivilous, and without Ground. They do not ſo warmly, and proudly affirm now, <hi>That they were the Men who brought him in;</hi> and all the Love, and previous Grimaces, and the faint Acclamations before his Arrival, are turned into dull and inſignificant <hi>Shruggs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The glorious <hi>Changes</hi> at the <hi>INN</hi> have almoſt work'd them into their Ancient Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: The Conſternation is great, but they have always a Body of Reſerve ready to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain them under the moſt ſhocking and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Defeats. It is pleaſant to hear theſe Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, who but a few Days ago, were heard to utter the moſt melodious Things imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Mr. WRIGHT, now aſſume a dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Air of reaſoning upon his Conduct; and ſtraining themſelves into ambiguous and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Hints; as if his known and celebrated Virtue were any way in the Caſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing ſuch a pack of deep Mouth'd <hi>Curs,</hi> that are always full Cry in running down <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Innocence;</hi> and where they have neither Courage nor Honeſty to ſpeak: their Minds, are Villains enough to make diſtant and raskally Reflections. But let them take care, for we have a ſubſtantial pair of <hi>Stocks</hi> here, and a <hi>Whipping-Poſt</hi> of the fitteſt Magnitude, equal to the brawnieſt Back of the moſt Sizeable Villain among them; beſides two ſturdy young <hi>Elms</hi> at the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0147504900:7"/>
Towns-end, that grew in a true Proteſtant Country where HEREDITARY RIGHT, SLAVERY, and ARBITRARY POWER were never heard off.</p>
            <p>I am vexed that I muſt trouble you with ſuch Trifles as theſe, but I ſhall never get through my Purpoſe without letting you into theſe little Details; nor wou'd you be ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to reliſh Things more momentous, if you were not truely poſſeſſed of the preſent State and litigious Spirit of the Party You remember what they were in Power, and 'tis proper you ſhou'd know what they are in <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They forget the old Proverb, <hi>That Sawce for the Gooſe is Sawce for the Gander.</hi> What havock they made in turning out the <hi>Old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> upon the moſt frivolous Pretences, and what a Scrabling they made to get their Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into the <hi>Widow's Diſh.</hi> Never was ſuch a Set of <hi>Cormorants</hi> known, they devoured by wholeſale, yet went on with eager Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt the <hi>Old Servants,</hi> the better to conceal their own voracious Stomachs: One was accuſed of taking <hi>Half Penny Rolls</hi> out of the <hi>Bakers</hi> Basket, another for Embezling the <hi>Hay and Oats,</hi> and a third for receiving <hi>Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings</hi> and not bringing the Money to the <hi>Bar:</hi> But for Truth, they left that to be made out by <hi>Jonathan Wormwood</hi> their <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuenſis</hi> a very <hi>bitter</hi> Fellow againſt all the <hi>old Servants,</hi> a witty facetious Varlet, and a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0147504900:8"/>
and hanger on to <hi>Bob,</hi> who kept him for ſuch Purpoſes, for which he was excellently qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, for he was as wicked as his Heart could wiſh; and had the beſt Talent at <hi>Railery</hi> and <hi>Lies</hi> a Man could poſſibly be endued-withal.</p>
            <p>How he handled the <hi>Widow's Friends</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> you have heard already; it was however equal to the Juſtice and Candour of all their other Proceedings, and helpt to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh half the Blockheads in Town of that Party with Matter to hold an Argument. Some drew the whole <hi>Rigmaro</hi> into a kind of uſeful Common Place, for the greater Eaſe to their Memory's; and every <hi>Jackdaw</hi> or <hi>Owl</hi> in Town could hoot out ſome ſenceleſs Leſſon taken from his Scurrilous Memoirs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bob</hi> had half a Dozen of theſe Fellows at his Beck, who hated him heartily, but for the Bread they receiv'd out of the <hi>Widow's Basket.</hi> Every Raskal had his ſeparate Inſtructions. To one it was given to blacken the <hi>Widow's</hi> Friends, and ſhew the Neceſſity of coming to an Agreement without them; to another, to render our own Condition deſperate, the better to frighten People into a Sence of it; a third was to run down the Credit of the Old Servants, and cry up the great Honeſty of the new; a fourth, to diſcant on the <hi>Church;</hi> a fifth on <hi>Trade;</hi> and a ſixth inceſſantly to cry out <hi>Faction, Plots, wicked Deſigns,</hi> &amp;c. and keep the Town in continual Alarm, to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0147504900:9"/>
prevent their cooling, or recovering their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sences.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Tools,</hi> as infamous as they were, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Ends they were employed on: the Mob eſpecially, and the moſt unthinking and injudicious People, were taken by the Ears, and liſtened to them with great Attention, and by ſuch Mountebank Methods, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of their Proceedings at the <hi>Inn</hi> was wholly ſupported.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Widow,</hi> poor Woman, they kept up in her Chamber, and perſuaded her, that her appearing below Stairs might be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to her Health, and that every thing went on well, and her <hi>Cuſtomers</hi> appeared all very much pleaſed with their Entertainment: So that ſhe ſeldome came into the <hi>Bar,</hi> unleſs now and then on a <hi>Market-day</hi> or ſo, or at a CLUB-SUPPER, when it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for her to paſs ſome <hi>Accounts.</hi> The Rogues had indeed ſome Reaſon to ſay, ſhe was miſled and abuſed by the Old Servants, if they judged from the reſult of their own Conduct, for they found ſhe was a perfect eaſie Woman; and if her <hi>Tenants</hi> and <hi>Cuſtomers</hi> were but pleaſed with their Uſage, ſhe ſeldome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired further, and they took ſpecial Care that none of the Old Servants might come near her, and ſtifled all Letters by the Poſt when they ſuſpected the Hand Writing, for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0147504900:10"/>
fear ſhe ſhou'd get any Intelligence of the true State of the <hi>Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were taking all other Methods they could think on to make the Game ſure, when they differed among themſelves about the Means, and to the great Satisfaction of the Town, fell together by the Ears, <hi>Nab,</hi> like an ungrateful Slut as ſhe was, had not that regard to the Advancement <hi>Bob</hi> had been a Means to promote her to; and perhaps there was ſomething in it more than ordinary: <hi>Bob</hi> was on the decline, aged Fifty-five, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; of a temperate and phlegmatick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. <hi>Harry</hi> was in the meridian of his Days; a robuſt young Dog, full of Life and Fire, with a vigorous Shape, ſtrong Back, and hale Complexion, fed high, and had an amorous Soul of his own. The Rogue has good Blood in his Veins too, but no more the Son of old <hi>HARRY</hi> than I am of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter.</hi> The old Man diſowns his Proceedings, and ſays, he always feared he would come to ſome violent End, from his turbulent diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Spirit. That his Mother, reſt her Soul, dreamt of a <hi>Comet</hi> the Night ſhe was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of him, and could never govern him as he ſhou'd be. Nay, you muſt know the young Knave took up a Belt againſt his own Father once at a WRESTLING, and threw him out of the <hi>Ring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0147504900:11"/>
But to proceed. <hi>Harry,</hi> by theſe ſtrong Perſuaſions, drew <hi>Nab</hi> into his Party: Not that ſhe has many <hi>Babies</hi> to be ſeen in her Eyes, for they have for ſome Years paſt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played but a very dull Water, yet the Jade had a feeling Conception of the foregoing Qualifications, and there was an excellent Character ſtirring of his ſingular Talent that Way. <hi>Nab Eveſdropt</hi> dropp'd all that paſs'd between the <hi>VVidow</hi> and <hi>Bob,</hi> and gave <hi>Harry</hi> an Account ſtill; and took all Opportunities to improve Things to his Advantage, for I ſhould have told you, that <hi>Nab,</hi> according to <hi>Bob</hi>'s Prediction, was by this Time become a Lady; and I can aſſure you, valued herſelf not a little upon it: She looked as much above her former <hi>Occupation,</hi> as an <hi>Upſtart 'Squire</hi> does above a <hi>Hack,</hi> when he has dipt the ANTIENT SEAT, for a Gilt Chariot, and a Pair of <hi>Swiſſ Tails. Nab</hi> was <hi>Hand and Glove</hi> with the <hi>VVidow,</hi> and not a Pin could be ſtuck right, if it was not of <hi>Nab</hi>'s do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for <hi>Nab</hi> had been well brought up, and could handle her Needle, tiff up a Fall below, or do any other Work, as well as Drudgery; tho' the BEESOM was indeed the moſt exquiſitely adapted to her Hands of any other Perquiſite of her Office. <hi>Nab</hi> kept the <hi>VVidow's Purſe,</hi> and bought <hi>Perfumes, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and <hi>Patches,</hi> &amp;c. and made many a round Penny of her Markettings: She had

a Liquoriſh Tooth of her own, and loved a Cordial at her Heart, which ſhe always poſted in her Bill of Incidents: They ſay 'twas pretty large at the <hi>VVidow's</hi> Death.</p>
            <p>There were other of the Female Servants at the INN violently attached to <hi>Harry</hi>'s Perſon, through the Impreſſion of his ſmug Countenance, and brawny Shoulders: No <hi>Page</hi> cou'd ſwallow <hi>Quince-Marmalet</hi> more greedily, than theſe <hi>Simpering Baggages</hi> did the Complimental Addreſſes of the young <hi>Brazier;</hi> every one believing, like <hi>Don John</hi>'s ſix Wives, <hi>That ſhe was the VVoman!</hi> and each putting herſelf forward, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Addreſs to ſerve him, and render him gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the Eyes of the <hi>VVidow:</hi> This it is to have the Reputation of being what we call <hi>a VVoman's Man: Bob,</hi> with all his Politick Airs, and Set Faces, could not conjure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Womens Graces, and <hi>Harry</hi> had a favourable Gift beyond all the Magick of his <hi>VVand. Harry</hi> wou'd Dance with them on the Green, play at <hi>Drop-Glove, Stool-Ball,</hi> and the like; which <hi>Bob</hi> was too fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſtiff in the Hams for; and could only figh that he had introduced ſuch a Smock-faced young <hi>VVhoreſbird</hi> to Supplant him.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0147504900:13"/>
Thus you ſee by what Meaſures <hi>Harry</hi> carried his Point, and engag'd the <hi>Private Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi> of theſe <hi>Female Advocates,</hi> whoſe ſhort Triumph, and ſudden Fall, is now the Subject of their Tears and Concern. Realy, the Fellow might be very happy, could he but lay aſide Ambition, and confine himſelf to a rural kind of Life. The great Reſort of Females his Reputation wou'd ſoon draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, could not but afford a very happy Proſpect of Pleaſure to one, who is by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fitlier qualified for the lacivious Drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a <hi>Seraglio,</hi> than the Gravity of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Buſineſs. In ſhort, <hi>Harry</hi>'s a very pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Fellow, and a boon Companion; but the Rogue was ſo near ſacrificing his Country; he's never to be truſted at the INN more, if he comes off no worſe.</p>
            <p>I muſt not forget, that I promiſed you an Account of the preſent State thereof. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with telling you of the ſeveral <hi>Changes</hi> made at the INN, and what was likely to enſue. <hi>Charles,</hi> the <hi>Head-Oſtler,</hi> and <hi>Ned Topſail,</hi> as I hinted, are both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to their Places: Honeſt <hi>VVill Truby</hi> has joſtled that queer Fellow <hi>Jack Squeamiſh,</hi> out of his STEWARDSHIP; and <hi>Frank Stirrup,</hi> Son of old <hi>Ralph</hi> the <hi>Caſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper,</hi> has received the Keys of the COF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FER

again, from the reluctant Hands of <hi>Nab</hi>'s enabled <hi>Conſort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every thing looks with a good Aſpect, and the Houſe begins to appear in its ancient Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur: You may remember in what a Plight you left us; Solitary and Diſconſolate; our Credit ſunk; our Trade cramp'd and ruin'd; the <hi>Country</hi> Beggard; and the INN in the Hands of a Set of Arbritrary Fellows that drove on <hi>Jehu-</hi>like to our Deſtruction; our Friends affronted and diſcouraged; Honeſt Men put out of all, and none but a parcel of indefeaſible Raskals preferr'd, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved hanging for their known Zeal to young <hi rend="blackletterType">Shute:</hi> But you will now find us with ſmiling Countenances, chearful Spirits, and compoſed Minds. We could hardly ſpeak before for fear of our <hi>Taskmaſters;</hi> but we dare now Noſe thoſe Villains that uſed to gibe us. Men of Integrity are only looked on at the INN, and to have been well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the New LANDLORD, is the beſt Argument for preſent Merit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robin Bold,</hi> the Plummer, <hi>Dick File-duſt,</hi> the Smith, <hi>Nick Silver-Tongue,</hi> the Lapida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the reſt of the honeſt Lads that ſtood titely for him at the laſt WRESTLING, are brought into Play again, and are ready to take up a <hi>Cudgel</hi> on the <hi>ſame ſide</hi> whenever Occaſion offers. They threaten us hard in ſome Parts
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0147504900:15"/>
of the <hi>Country,</hi> but we have as good as carried the <hi>Belt</hi> in this <hi>Town</hi> already almoſt two to one; and we doubt not but to ſhew 'em fair Play for it every where elſe: We have a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of mettled Lads that have been uſed to Sport, and are not afraid of a broken Head or two, if it comes to the Puſh.</p>
            <p>You may remember, I always told you <hi>Things</hi> could not laſt long as they went on; and 'tis confirmed what I told you in my Firſt, that the <hi>VVidow</hi> deſigned to have made great Alterations at the <hi>INN,</hi> had ſhe recovered. 'Tis likewiſe as certain, that they broke her Heart among them, by diſcovering one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Rogueries, when they fell out. Poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man! they had harraſs'd her ſo for 3 Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and made her break her Words often with her honeſt <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Tenants,</hi> that when ſhe came once to reflect, it caſt her into ſuch a deep Melancholy, as carried her precipitately to the Grave. In her laſt Intervals, ſhe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the following <hi>Soliloquy,</hi> to this Effect, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Unhappy Woman! have I for this ſo long eat the Bread of Carefulneſs? Took Pains early and late to promote a Trade, and gain Reputation to the INN, on purpoſe to make all thy <hi>Tenants</hi> and <hi>Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> eaſie and happy? And is all my Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Care come to this at laſt? It was not ſo, ſays ſhe, in the Days of my old Servants: My Affairs went well then;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0147504900:16"/>
and nothing I undertook but was Succeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. I had a Reputation far and near, and was eſteemed and courted even by my very Adverſaries: My Tenants and Cuſtomers were perpetually Rejoicing; but I fear I have now given them too great an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Sorrow. Could I recal a little Time, <hi>But I ſhall ne'er outlive it;</hi> I wou'd endeavour to remove the Cauſe, and make them all eaſie again. But this is reſerved for Heaven and my Succeſſor: Tell my poor <hi>People</hi> I dye theirs; and yet I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I cannot do more to redreſs them before I depart.</q> This ſaid, ſhe turned about, and with a Sigh breathed out her Soul to him that gave it.</p>
            <p>Were theſe Fellows capable of Correction, ſure this would have ſome effect on them: But I deſpair of ever ſeeing them ſhew the leaſt Signs of Grace and Repentance.</p>
            <p>You have heard how they wou'd have inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated themſelves into Mr. WRIGHT'S Favour, and what a fawning and cringing they uſed at firſt, but when they ſaw he was not to be cajoled, and made a very juſt Diſtinction of their Proceedings toward him, by clearing the <hi>Houſe</hi> of them; they preſently changed their Notes, and are forming a Cabal againſt his Conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0147504900:17"/>
The rewarding the long and eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of honeſt <hi>John Truſty,</hi> is one of the greateſt <hi>Cuts</hi> to 'em of all; for tho' they bear the reſt with Spleen and Impatience enough, yet there is in this a double Portion of Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. <hi>John</hi> was the Honour and Support of the old <hi>Servants,</hi> and the Terror and Diſgrace of the <hi>New: John</hi> caried the CAUSE a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Old <hi rend="blackletterType">Savage</hi> for many Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the great Diſadvantage of their Idol Young <hi rend="blackletterType">Shute. John</hi> refuſed to Countenance their Schemes in making the Compoſition, and rather choſe to retire out of the Country, than breath the ſame Air with ſuch Villains as ſeemed to have abandoned all Faith and Honour, and were driving at the Ruin of their Country. And if that Raskal <hi>Slyboots</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to anſwer but the Perſecution and ill Treatment of this worthy Man, that were enough never to have him forgiven.</p>
            <p>How eaſie it is to gueſs the Rage and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment theſe Fellows are in at Mr. WRIGHT's glorious Proceedings. They ſay, <hi>he begins too ſoon, moves too faſt, and that this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not laſt long,</hi> with other ſuch rediculous Stuff: But theſe are rather their Wiſhes than their Sentiments; both which are as much below his Reſentment, as the ſenceleſs Reflection of the Party. He came here to govern, and choſe rather to ſhew them, that he ſaw no
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0147504900:18"/>
Reaſon to conceal his Reſentment, nor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Men about him whom he cou'd not chuſe but be uneaſie at; and if they have any Modeſty, they ought to believe themſelves obnoxious, and make a ſilent Retreat. That there was more Sincerity and Juſtice in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf freely at firſt, and letting them ſee he had no Reaſon to diſguiſe himſelf, than to act in Deference to their Judgment, or have any regard to the cenſure of People he had ſo little reaſon to value. They Miſtake, he has both too much Courage and too much Honeſty to endeavour to veil his Conduct; or proceed with the leaſt regard to their empty Commendations: <hi>Hipocriſie</hi> was Property a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becoming the laſt Three Years, than the Prudence, Juſtice, Honour, and excellent Management of the New LANDLORD, whoſe <hi>Rule</hi> is TO REWARD HIS FRIENDS, DO JUSTICE TO HIS ENEMIES; AND FEAR NONE.</p>
            <p>They are endeavouring to poſſeſs the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that he deſigns to curtail the Dignity of the INN; by reducing the Gates two Foot narrower in Circumference; to prohibit the <hi>Eating of Beef;</hi> abridge the Servants Wages; and allow them only Small Beer at their Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; and finally, that he intends to take down the <hi>Steeple,</hi> and employ the <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Rubbiſh</hi> to make a <hi>Fence</hi> for the <hi>Conventicle,</hi> with other
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0147504900:19"/>
prepoſterous <hi>Cant.</hi> Then to give terrible Ideas of his Perſon. They repreſent him with a furious ſtern Look, and a Head like a <hi>Dragon;</hi> with Scales and Fins like a Fiſh, and with ſuch like incredible Stuff endeavour to make an Impreſſion on the People; but let them go on, when they have <hi>Lyed</hi> till they are weary of it the <hi>Banter</hi> will end in their own Shame and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>I could enlarge egregiouſly on his admirable Qualities; the great Temperance, Juſtice, Candour and Moderation of his Temper; but I ſhall omit it till a more favourable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, having already almoſt fill'd up my Scrole.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgot to tell you, that ſome unlucky Knaves, in a Picture ſpread privately about, have drawn poor <hi>Harry</hi> in <hi>Deep Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> with the LEAGUE in one Hand, and a <hi>Halter</hi> in the other.
