            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>THERE was a young Weſt-country man,</l>
               <l>A Carpenter by trade;</l>
               <l>A ſkilful wheelwright too was he,</l>
               <l>And few ſuch Waggons made.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>No Man a tighter Barn cou'd build,</l>
               <l>Throughout his native town,</l>
               <l>Thro' many a village round was he,</l>
               <l>The beſt of workmen known.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His father left him what he had,</l>
               <l>In ſooth it was enough;</l>
               <l>His ſhining pewter, pots of braſs,</l>
               <l>And all his houſehold ſtuff.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A little cottage too he had,</l>
               <l>For eaſe and comfort plann'd,</l>
               <l>And that he might not lack for ought,</l>
               <l>An acre of good land.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A pleaſant orchard too there was,</l>
               <l>Before his cottage door;</l>
               <l>Of cider and of corn likewiſe,</l>
               <l>He had a little ſtore.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Active and healthy, ſtout and young,</l>
               <l>No buſineſs wanted he;</l>
               <l>Now tell me reader if you can,</l>
               <l>What man more bleſt cou'd be?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To make his comfort quite compleat,</l>
               <l>He had a faithful Wife;</l>
               <l>Frugal and neat and good was ſhe,</l>
               <l>The bleſſing of his life.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>Where is the Lord, or where the Squire.</l>
               <l>Had greater cauſe to praiſe,</l>
               <l>The goodneſs of that bounteous hand,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Each night when he return'd from work,</l>
               <l>His wife ſo meek and mild,</l>
               <l>His little ſupper gladly dreſs'd,</l>
               <l>While he careſs'd his child.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>One blooming babe was all he had,</l>

               <l>And ſpoil ſo fair a lot?</l>
               <l>O what cou'd change ſo kind a heart,</l>
               <l>All goodneſs quite forgot?</l>

               <l>The diſmal cauſe reveal,</l>
               <l>'Twas EVIL COMPANY and DRINK,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>A Cooper came to live hard by,</l>
               <l>Who did his fancy pleaſe;</l>
               <l>An idle rambling Man was he,</l>
               <l>Who oft had croſs'd the ſeas.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This Man could tell a merry tale,</l>
               <l>And ſing a merry ſong;</l>
               <l>And thoſe who heard him ſing or talk,</l>
               <l>Ne'er thought the ev'ning long.</l>

            <figure/>
            <lg>
               <l>But vain and vicious was the ſong,</l>
               <l>And wicked was the tale;</l>
               <l>And every pauſe he always fill'd,</l>
               <l>With cider, gin, or ale.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Our Carpenter delighted much,</l>
               <l>To hear the Cooper talk;</l>
               <l>And with him to the Ale-houſe oft,</l>
               <l>Wou'd take his evening walk.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

            <lg>
               <l>He ſaid the Cooper's company,</l>
               <l>Was all for which he car'd;</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His hammer now neglected lay,</l>

               <l>Half finiſh'd wheels, and broken tools,</l>
               <l>Were ſtrew'd about his yard.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To get him to attend his work,</l>
               <l>No prayers cou'd now prevail:</l>
               <l>His hatchet and his plane forgot,</l>
               <l>He never drove a Nail.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His chearful ev'nings now no more,</l>
               <l>With peace and plenty ſmil'd;</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For not his drunken nights alone,</l>

               <l>His days were at the Angel ſpent,</l>
