            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>You have hit it, Mr. <hi>Aeſop,</hi> you have
hit it—I have given it away, indeed—I did
not receive one Farthing for my laſt Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and yet would you believe it?—I
abſolutely gave all the Virtues in Heav'n, to
one of the loweſt Reptiles upon Earth.</p>

               <p>Ay, Sir, to do dirty Work, and ſtill

the Thirſt of <hi>Tantalus</hi>—You <hi>Greek</hi> Writers,

they won't do now a-days—our

gain'd the greateſt Favours, by ſhewing your

               <p>Why, Mr. <hi>Aeſop,</hi> I am troubled with
an odd kind of a Diſorder—I have a ſort of
a Whiſtling—a Singing—a Whizzing as
it were in my Head, which I cannot get
rid of—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Aeſop.</speaker>
               <p>Our Waters give no Relief to bodily

               <speaker>Poet.</speaker>
               <p>From whence all my Diſorder pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds—
I'll tell you my Caſe, Sir—
You muſt know, I wrote a Play ſome time
ago, preſented a Dedication of it to a certain
young Nobleman—He approv'd and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of it, but before I could taſte his
Bounty, my Piece was unfortunately damn'd:
—I loſt my Benefit, nor could I have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to my Patron, for I was told that his
Lordſhip play'd the beſt Catcall the firſt
Night, and was the merrieſt Perſon in the
whole Audience.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aeſop.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, what do you call damning a
Play?—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Poet.</speaker>
               <p>You cannot poſſibly be ignorant,
what it is to be damn'd, Mr. <hi>Aeſop?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aeſop.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed I am, Sir—We had no
ſuch thing among the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Poet.</speaker>
               <p>No, Sir!—No Wonder then that
you <hi>Greeks</hi> were ſuch fine Writers—It is
impoſſible to be deſcrib'd, or truly felt, but
by the Author himſelf—If you could but
get a Leave of Abſence from this World for
a few Hours, you might perhaps have an
Opportunity of ſeeing it yourſelf—There is
a Sort of a new Piece comes upon our Stage
this very Night, and I am pretty ſure it will
meet with its Deſerts; at leaſt it ſhall not
want my helping Hand, rather than you
ſhould be diſappointed of ſatisfying your
Curioſity.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Poet.</speaker>
               <p>Envy, Malice and Party deſtroy'd
me—You
muſt know, Sir, I was a great
Damner myſelf, before I was damn'd—So
the Frolicks of my Youth were return'd to me
with double Intereſt, from my Brother Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors—But,
to ſay the Truth, my Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
was terribly handled, before it appear'd
in publick.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aeſop.</speaker>
               <p>How ſo, pray?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Poet.</speaker>
               <p>Why Sir, ſome ſqueamiſh Friends
of mine prun'd it of all the Bawdy and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality,
the Actors did not ſpeak a Line of
the Senſe or Sentiment, and the Manager
(who writes himſelf) ſtruck out all the
Wit and Humour, in order to lower my
Performance to a Level with his own.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aeſop.</speaker>
               <p>Now, Sir, I am acquainted with
your Caſe, what have you to propoſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Poet.</speaker>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the Succeſs of my
firſt Play, I am ſtrongly perſuaded that my
next may defy the Severity of Criticks, the
Sneer of Wits, and the Malice of Authors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aeſop.</speaker>
               <p>What! have you been hardy enough
to attempt another?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Poet.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt eat, Sir—I muſt live—but
when I ſit down to write, and am glowing
with the Heat of my Imagination, then—this
damn'd Whiſtling—or Whizzing in my
Head, that I told you of, ſo diſorders me,
that I grow giddy—In ſhort, Sir, I am
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0047600800:13"/>
haunted, as it were, with the Ghoſt of my
deceas'd Play, and its dying Groans, are for
ever in my Ears—Now, Sir, if you will
give me but a Draught of <hi>Lethe,</hi> to forget
this unfortunate Performance, it will be of
more real Service to me, than all the Waters
of <hi>Helicon.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aeſop.</speaker>
               <p>I doubt, Friend, you cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
write better, by merely forgetting that
you have written before; beſides, if, when
you drink to the Forgetfulneſs of your own
Works, you ſhould unluckily forget thoſe of
other People too, your next Piece will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be the worſe for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Poet.</speaker>
               <p>You are certainly in the right—
What then would you adviſe me to?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aeſop.</speaker>
               <p>Suppoſe you could prevail upon the

your former Work, might be of no ſmall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to your future Productions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Poet.</speaker>
               <p>Ah, Sir! if I could but do that—

               <p>Yes; but you may not always meet

<hi>Modeſty,</hi> that when a fine Woman

            <sp>
               <speaker>Aeſop.</speaker>
               <p>My Advice, Sir, would go a great

Muſick and Painting in <hi>Italy,</hi> Dancing,
Gaming, and ſome other Amuſements, at

I brought over with me the beſt Collection

Dancer, and a Monkey, with Tooth-picks,
Pictures and Burlettas—In ſhort, I have ſkim'd
the Cream of every Nation, and have the

               <p>A fine Lady before Marriage,
lives with her Papa and Mama, who breed
her up till ſhe learns to deſpiſe 'em, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
to do nothing they bid her; this makes
her ſuch a prodigious Favourite, that ſhe
wants for nothing.</p>

               <p>She lies in Bed all Morning,
rattles about all Day, and ſits up all Night;
ſhe goes every where, and ſees every thing;
knows every body, and loves no body; ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicules
her Friends, coquets with her Lovers,
ſets 'em together by the Ears, tells Fibs,
makes Miſchief, buys China, cheats at Cards,
keeps a Pug-dog, and hates the Parſons; ſhe
laughs much, talks aloud, never bluſhes, ſays
what ſhe will, does what ſhe will, goes where
ſhe will, marries whom ſhe pleaſes, hates
her Huſband in a Month, breaks his Heart
in four, becomes a Widow, ſlips from her
Gallants, and begins the World again—
There's a Life for you? What do you think
of a fine Lady now?</p>
