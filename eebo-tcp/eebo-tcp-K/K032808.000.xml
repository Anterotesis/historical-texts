            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0218202800:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Malicious</hi> Productions are generally beſt deſpiſed; but leſt <hi>Silence</hi> ſhould be look'd upon as an Argument of Guilt, as in theſe Caſes by the Weak it ſometimes is, and Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> ſhould be encourag'd to deal farther in <hi>Calumny</hi> and <hi>Aſperſion,</hi> I am at length induced to give him a Reply, which I ſhall at once enter upon, without farther Preface or Preamble.</p>
            <p>To begin then with his <hi>Dedication:</hi> The only Motives of Dedications ſeem to be, either to ſubmit one's Performance to a proper <hi>Judge,</hi> to make ſome ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of <hi>Gratitude</hi> for Benefits receiv'd; or elſe to <hi>curry Favour.</hi> Now, as the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and worthy Lady, to whom Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> has dedicated his Book, cannot poſſibly be ſuppoſed to be a <hi>Judge</hi> of its Merit; and, in all probability, never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd the leaſt <hi>Favour</hi> upon the <hi>Author,</hi> the <hi>Reader</hi> cannot well be miſtaken in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturing what was Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi>'s <hi>true Drift</hi> in his <hi>Dedication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>Quibble, how a Man can be a Wife, without being an Hermaphrodite?</hi> Whether a <hi>Maid</hi> may not be taught the Art of delivering Women, and yet be no <hi>Wife?</hi> That <hi>Widows</hi> lay Women, and yet are not <hi>Wifes,</hi> and his Query about <hi>Girl-Midwifes,</hi> are too low and trifling to deſerve
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0218202800:4"/>a ſerious Anſwer, and ſeem rather to be the product of a pert <hi>Sufficiency,</hi> than a ſound <hi>Judgment.</hi> They are rather Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of one who was willing to cut him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out Work for criticiſing at all Events, than of a cool and ſober Reaſoner.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to his, I ſhall beg leave to put the following <hi>Queries.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. If the Term <hi>Midwifery</hi> is properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Practice of that Art, when in the Hands of either Sex, why may not either Man or Woman ſo practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, be in Propriety of Speech call'd a <hi>Midwife?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. Is not the Word <hi>Midwifery</hi> rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of Practice on a <hi>Wife,</hi> who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is preſum'd to want the Aſſiſtance of a Man or Woman in the preſent Caſe, than of the <hi>Sex</hi> of the Perſon practiſing?</item>
               <item>3. On receding from the common Form and Cuſtom of Speech in this Caſe, is not the ſuppoſed Abſurdity exchang'd for <hi>Unintelligibility?</hi> That is, what Idea can be fix'd to, what Etymology found for the new Term <hi>Midman</hi> and <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman?</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The Word <hi>Midman,</hi> he owns himſelf, is not an over-neat Expreſſion, and it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0218202800:5"/>carries (to uſe his own Words) <hi>more Nonſenſe in the very Front of it,</hi> than the Term he has endeavoured to explode. <hi>Cuſtom</hi> or <hi>Uſe</hi> hath always the Effect of a <hi>Law;</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Quem penes arbitrium eſt &amp; jus &amp; norma loquendi.</p>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>Hor.</hi>
               </bibl>
            </q>
            <p>And what is <hi>Language</hi> but a <hi>cuſtomary</hi> and receiv'd uſe of Words? So that we may ſee the Term <hi>Man-Midwife</hi> may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, both from <hi>Cuſtom</hi> and <hi>Propriety,</hi> and will doubtleſs be in uſe long after Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> himſelf ſhall be forgotten.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 3. Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> falls very foul on the Character of the celebrated Dr. <hi>Chamberlen,</hi> repreſenting him as <hi>puzzling</hi> and <hi>confounding</hi> the Art he profeſs'd, to the Advantage of moſt of the greateſt Families in this Kingdom, rather than <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving</hi> it; and very indecently, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly too, brands him as an <hi>artful</hi> and <hi>inſinuating</hi> Tranſlator. He ſays, he rather <hi>darkens,</hi> than <hi>explains</hi> his Author's (<hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riceau</hi>'s) Meaning; and confidently affirms, <hi>all the additional Knowledge he was the Author of,</hi> to be only to tell the World, that <hi>He,</hi> and his <hi>Family,</hi> can aſſiſt Women in Labour better than any body elſe, and gives him the mean <hi>Epithet</hi> of a <hi>Noſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger.</hi> (<hi>Page</hi> 4.) He pronounces every thing with an <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> like a ſecond <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and ſets himſelf up at once,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0218202800:6"/>both for <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Jury.</hi> The late learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dr. <hi>Friend,</hi> in his Epiſtle to Dr. <hi>Mead, about Purging in the Small Pox,</hi> gives Dr. <hi>Chamberlen</hi> a very different Character from Mr. <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> ſpeaking of him as one <hi>moſt ſkilful in the Art he profeſs'd;</hi> (<hi>Hiſt.</hi> 5.) Whence we may plainly ſee, how different the Character of the ſame Perſon is, when drawn by <hi>real</hi> and <hi>pretended</hi> Judges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 5. He taxes him with perverting Mr. <hi>Mauriceau</hi>'s Deſign by his Tranſlation, and having his own Litereſt at heart more than that of the <hi>Midwomen,</hi> as he ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly terms them.</p>
            <p>He accuſes him of <hi>coaxing</hi> the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, and yet in the ſame Sentence <hi>coaxes</hi> them himſelf, and pays a fulſome Compliment to the Qualifications of the <hi>Town Midwomen</hi> above thoſe in the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. P.</hi> 5. The <hi>Town Midwomen</hi> may poſſibly (ſome of them) become his <hi>Pupils,</hi> when he gives his intended <hi>Lectures,</hi> and ſo ought in Prudence to be well ſpoken of. But thoſe in the Country being too remote for this extraordinary Advantage, will, for aught I can ſee, in his Opinion, ſtill labour under the Imputation of being <hi>unqualified</hi> ('till his Scheme for having <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> to inſtruct the <hi>Midwomen</hi> in Country places can take Effect) unleſs their Affairs can permit them to take a Journey to <hi>Lad
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0218202800:7"/>Lane,</hi> where, it ſeems, the only Perſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to inſtruct them is to be met with.</p>
            <p>Upon Dr. <hi>Chamberlen's</hi> ſaying, <q>"that in Countries and Places where Advice is not ſeaſonably to be had, Midwifes are compelled to do their beſt, <hi>as God ſhall enable</hi> them (P. 5.)"</q> which is a common Expreſſion for a conſcientious diſcharge of their Duty, according to the beſt of their Abilities. Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> takes occaſion here, to cut a very indecent <hi>Joke</hi> upon the <hi>Deity,</hi> by aſking, <hi>if God has any where promiſed to give any more Aſſiſtance to a Country, than a Town Midwoman?</hi> In the next place, he ſubſtitutes <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Doctor</hi> acting as <hi>two equal</hi> Beings; and then, to prove that the Divine God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head will reward us with the Knowledge of any uſeful Art, in Proportion to our own honeſt Diligence and Aſſiduity, which in holy Writ he has aſſured us he will; or, which is the ſame thing, to prove a point of <hi>Revelation,</hi> he quotes a Paſſage from a <hi>Heathen Poet; Dii laborantibus om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia vendunt:</hi> thereby making mention of <hi>falſe</hi> Gods in the plural Number, for what the true and one God only can perform. <hi>Riſum teneatis?</hi> Upon Dr. <hi>Chamberlen</hi>'s adviſing the good Women not to blame thoſe who are not backward in dangerous Caſes, to deſire Advice, leſt it coſt them <hi>dear;</hi> he indecently aſks: <hi>If it does not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0218202800:8"/>always coſt them dear when they do?</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding, I preſume, to the Gratifications u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually given in ſuch Caſes; notwithſtanding he advances, a little farther, that a SUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEON ought to be well ſatisfied for any Improvement in, or Invention relating to, a manual Operation, <hi>P.</hi> 20. Is not <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery,</hi> wherever the Help of either Man or Woman is required, in the ſtricteſt Senſe a <hi>manual</hi> Operation? And if ſo, why muſt not a <hi>Phyſician</hi> be rewarded for his Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as well as a <hi>Surgeon.</hi> But <hi>Self,</hi> like Oil, will be always uppermoſt.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Page (the 7th.) the Plot of Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi>'s whole Performance begins to open, when he ſays, that the <hi>Midwomen's</hi> want of Knowledge is more their <hi>Misfortune</hi> than their <hi>Fault,</hi> becauſe they have not yet had ſuch proper Opportunities of informing themſelves as they ought to have. But now it muſt hereafter be their <hi>Fault</hi> more than their <hi>Misfortune,</hi> if they are not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter qualify'd, after knowing where the Source of all Knowledge in <hi>Midwifery</hi> is to be found. This is the firſt <hi>Act</hi> of Mr. <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi>'s <hi>Farce;</hi> and in the ſucceeding ones the <hi>Plot</hi> will unravel itſelf more and more, ſo as to be well underſtood by the dulleſt Reader, unleſs I am much miſtaken.</p>
            <p>He aſking (<hi>Pag.</hi> 8.) <q>"Whether <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> don't always make a ſad Out-cry,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0218202800:9"/>and are not alarm'd as if their <hi>Craft</hi> was in danger, when <hi>Surgeons</hi> uſe <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Ink,</hi> except in PAUPER Caſes,"</q> is an indecent and falſe Reflection on the Gentlemen of the Faculty. Herein he brands <hi>Phyſick,</hi> that glorious Science, with the ignominious Name of a <hi>Craft;</hi> as if it were only a <hi>knaviſh</hi> Combination of Men to get Money, and at the ſame time openly taxes them with <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Hardneſs of Heart,</hi> in denying their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to <hi>Paupers.</hi> It is well known, that all the Gentlemen of that Profeſſion, whoſe Advice is worth having, are very <hi>charitable,</hi> and willing to relieve the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Poor, without any View or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of <hi>Gratification.</hi> And where he can give me an Inſtance of one <hi>Surgeon's</hi> curing a <hi>Wound,</hi> ſetting a <hi>Fracture,</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a <hi>diſlocated Limb,</hi> for nothing, I'll undertake to bring him <hi>five Phyſicians</hi> in this Town that have attended in the moſt noiſome and contagious Diſtempers, without the leaſt Deſire of <hi>Reward:</hi> Nay, ſo far from it, they have relieved the Poor they have thus generouſly cur'd, with Money and other Neceſſaries out of their own private Bounty. But I ſhall leave this to the Reſentment of thoſe to whom it belongs.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Page he ſays, that the Doctor allows Midwives are compell'd to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0218202800:10"/>do their beſt, as <hi>God</hi> ſhall direct them; to which he replies: <hi>Now ſuppoſing God ſhould direct one of them to make uſe of a</hi> Crotchet, <hi>in a fit Caſe, and after a proper manner, muſt ſhe be try'd for her Life for it?</hi> Which is another ſhocking Joke upon the <hi>Godhead,</hi> equal, if not ſuperior to that before obſerved.</p>
            <p>Here too is another <hi>Coax</hi> to the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Midwomen, that the hardieſt of them would tremble, upon his Belief, at the very thought of a <hi>Crotchet,</hi> unleſs they were fully inſtructed how to uſe it. But poor unfortunate <hi>Country Midwomen!</hi> he cannot pretend to anſwer for them: They are at too remote a diſtance from <hi>Lad Lane</hi> to come to his <hi>Lectures;</hi> and if upon this melancholy occaſion I may be allow'd to borrow a Scrap of <hi>Latin</hi> from him, <hi>proh dolor!</hi> O lack! Olack!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 9. Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> aſks, <hi>if</hi> Dr. Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlen<hi>'s Cobweb is not eaſily ſeen thro'?</hi> Now, were I diſpoſed to Ill-nature, with how much more Juſtice might I apply this Saying to his own?</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0218202800:11"/>what I ſaid ſufficient, without an unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly Freedom.</p>

               <hi>Page</hi> 13. He beſtows upon Dr. <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlen</hi> the ignominious Title of a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial</hi> and <hi>dictatorial</hi> Writer.</p>
            <p>Not content with this, in the next Page (14.) he very candidly calls him, a <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Repeater,</hi> a <hi>nauſeous Recommender</hi> of his <hi>Noſtrum,</hi> a Writer that has not made one Remark to the Advantage of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, and one who ſeems to have had nothing elſe in view, but to tell them when they ought to ſend for him, and to let them know, that he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> could ſerve them better than any body elſe. All which may be reckoned as Proofs of Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi>'s want of <hi>Candour</hi> and <hi>good Manners.</hi> And now to make uſe of his own Words, <hi>utrum horum, p.</hi> 54.</p>

               <hi>Page</hi> 20. He owns, that <hi>Surgeons</hi> who have made any conſiderable Diſcovery in <hi>manual Operations,</hi> which cannot be made univerſally uſeful, as <hi>Medicines</hi> may, and really are, unleſs they are fully and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly explain'd, ſhould always commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate <hi>gratis</hi> the Fruits of their Labour and Expence. No, ſays he, they ought to be handſomely <hi>rewarded,</hi> not only for the real Service they have done, but to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0218202800:12"/>encourage Induſtry in others. Why then does he accuſe me for keeping the uſe of the <hi>Fillet</hi> a Secret, which is in the ſtricteſt Senſe a <hi>manual</hi> Operation, and one that cannot be made univerſally uſeful, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines may? Indeed he has here ſpoke my own private Sentiments; in this we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely agree: and I preſume he will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hereafter aſk me, why I don't com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it? He himſelf, it ſeems from his own Words, cannot expect it <hi>gratis;</hi> ſo that he muſt firſt tell me what he will be pleaſed to offer, before, we can come to any other Terms. However, for his Comfort, I promiſe him to be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable than he ſays Dr. <hi>Chamberlen</hi> was with the <hi>French</hi> King's <hi>Phyſician,</hi> p. 19. and to be contented with leſs than Ten thouſand Crowns; tho' in Proportion to the Superiority Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> always ſeems to think <hi>Surgeons</hi> have over <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> I ought at leaſt to inſiſt upon Twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>

               <hi>Page</hi> 21. He ſays Dr. <hi>Chamberlen is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent,</hi> and there very candidly ranks <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Apothecaries, Shavers,</hi> and <hi>Noſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers,</hi> all together; but has wiſely left the <hi>Surgeons,</hi> and conſequently himſelf, out of the Number, as being <hi>ſuperioris ſortis</hi> (ſtill to borrow a little more of his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) to <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Apothecaries.</hi> And now the Town has been informed of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0218202800:13"/>Merit, I hope no body will dare, after this publick Notification, to refuſe them their proper Homage, upon pain of Mr. <hi>John Douglaſs</hi>'s Diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Page he puts a Queſtion which no body ever denied: Whether the Good which <hi>Surgeons</hi> do their Patients be not as evident as the Sun? <hi>E. g.</hi> When they cut for the <hi>Stone,</hi> perforate the <hi>Scull,</hi> reduce a <hi>Luxation,</hi> &amp;c. But it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it ſeems, from <hi>Baglivi,</hi> whether the Cures ſuppos'd to be performed by <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,</hi> even thoſe of the <hi>firſt Rank,</hi> are moſtly owing to Nature, or the <hi>Medicines, &amp;c.</hi> which they directed. No one, that I know of, has ever queſtion'd the Good which <hi>Surgeons</hi> do in their own proper Profeſſion; but I am afraid, when they go beyond their <hi>Laſt,</hi> they'll doubly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify <hi>Baglivi</hi>'s Saying of the <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> and do more Harm than they are capable of foreſeeing. <hi>Surgeons,</hi> he obſerves, only practiſe <hi>Midwifery</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> and ſo, ſays he, <hi>they ought to do every where elſe.</hi> What then in his Wiſdom he will propoſe to be done with ſuch <hi>Phyſicians</hi> as are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in this Profeſſion, I know not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he will generouſly procure them to be promoted to the Dignity of <hi>Shavers</hi> (among which he juſt now choſe to rank them) for which the <hi>Faculty</hi> ought doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to be extreamly thankful.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0218202800:14"/>
            <p>A little after, he accuſes the Doctor of going out of his <hi>Ken;</hi> but why? Only becauſe he pretends to adviſe the <hi>Surgeons.</hi> And in the next Page (22.) to be even with him for this <hi>Preſumption,</hi> affirms, that the Doctor did not underſtand that very little part of <hi>Surgery,</hi> the Method of cutting Childrens Gums, ſo well as the very <hi>Nurſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſame Page he hints, as if the Doctor was not appris'd of the uſe of the <hi>Crotchet;</hi> and in the next Page (23.) concludes, that Mr. <hi>Mauriceau</hi> was a good and faithful <hi>Surgeon,</hi> and <hi>Chamberlen</hi> only a — <hi>Doctor,</hi> with a long Daſh before it. It is to be hop'd, Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> may ſo far overcome his <hi>Modeſty,</hi> as in the next Edition of his elaborate Performance, to fill up the <hi>Blanks</hi> that are in this. If the <hi>Antitheſis</hi> here is to hold good, and Mr. <hi>Mauriceau</hi> was a good and faithful <hi>Surgeon,</hi> which I will not deny, the contrary Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter muſt neceſſarily fall upon Dr. <hi>Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> as a <hi>Phyſician.</hi> But how far Mr. <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi> is capable of judging of the Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> or who ſet him up for a <hi>Cenſor,</hi> I muſt leave the <hi>Faculty</hi> to determine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 24. He ſums up the whole he has to ſay in relation to Dr. <hi>Chamberlen,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0218202800:15"/>in telling us, that his main Deſign, in his Preface and Notes upon Mr. <hi>Mauriceau</hi>s Book, was to PUZZLE, rather than <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct</hi> the Midwomen or Midmen; and to perſuade them, that He, and the reſt of the <hi>Noſtrum-mongers,</hi> as he ignominiouſly calls them, could ſerve them better than any other Artiſts.</p>
            <p>Now, is not this a very fine Character of a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> who was allow'd by all <hi>proper</hi> Judges, to be a Man of great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Abilities? If what he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate be believd, muſt not the Doctor appear viler than a common <hi>Pick-pocket</hi> or <hi>Street-robber, wilfully to puzzle and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead People in Matters relating to Life and Death?</hi> But what ſeems to ſtick moſt upon Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi>s Stomach, as a thing he can no ways digeſt, is the Doctor's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending <hi>Phyſicians</hi> as fitter Perſons to deliver Women than <hi>Surgeons.</hi> Will Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> pretend to ſay, that the <hi>Surgeons</hi> have more Knowledge, Learning, and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities than the Gentlemen of the Faculty? If not, how come <hi>Surgeons</hi> to be <hi>more</hi> qualified for the Art of Midwifery than <hi>Phyſicians?</hi> But Self is here to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; and Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> ſeems inclind for the common Good, to turn thoſe il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate People the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> out of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, pointing out the Occupation he thinks
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0218202800:16"/>them moſt fit to be employ'd in, under the <hi>laudable Profeſſion</hi> of SHAVERS.</p>
            <p>From Dr. <hi>Chamberlen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to Mr. <hi>Giffard,</hi> Surgeon, another late Writer in Midwifery; for it ſeems they muſt all feel his <hi>critical</hi> Laſh. But as I ſhall leave the Defence of Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> to his Publiſher, and Reviſer, the ingenious Dr. <hi>Hoddy,</hi> who is much more capable of doing it than myſelf, I ſhall be ſhort in my Remarks on this Head.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, upon Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi>s ingenuouſly relating, <q>"That a Man-Midwife had work'd upon a poor Woman, and left her in a <hi>worſe</hi> Condition than he found her,"</q> he makes this paultry <hi>Witticiſm,</hi> in a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> That <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> are not at all <hi>Witches</hi> any more than the <hi>Midwomen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 25. A little after, upon Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi>s ſaying, that the Fate of thoſe Children, whoſe <hi>Placenta</hi> offers firſt, is Death, if a proper Perſon be not at hand to deliver them immediately, he ſubjoins, who can be ſo proper, or likely to be in the Way, as a ſkilful <hi>Midwoman?</hi> and yet at the ſame time he obſerves, that as long as they want Skill to perform it, the Child muſt die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Midman</hi> can be brought. Now where the good Women are to meet with this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Skill, the Reader will ſee in the Sequel.</p>
            <p>Again, upon Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi>'s candidly ſaying, <q>"That Miſchiefs may be prevented by a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0218202800:17"/>ſkilful <hi>Operator,</hi> if ſent for in Time,"</q> he replies, but much better if a ſkilful <hi>Operatrix</hi> attended; thereby giving the <hi>Old Women</hi> the Preference before the <hi>Surgeons,</hi> which, as it does not ſeem to have been Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi>'s <hi>Drift,</hi> muſt be look'd upon as an <hi>unwary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 28. He aſks what ſignifies finding fault with the Midwives in every Page with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attempting a Remedy? And <hi>Pag.</hi> 33. affirms, that it is our Way to haul the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women in HEAD and SHOULDERS, <hi>guilty</hi> or not <hi>guilty.</hi> To which I ſhall only reply, that one, if not the only, Method of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Remedy, is, to find fault where they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, and ſtrictly, without <hi>Favour</hi> or <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,</hi> to ſhew them their <hi>Errors;</hi> without which, they will never be much improv'd. But that we haul them in, as he expreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Shoulders, guilty</hi> or not <hi>guilty,</hi> is what Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> ought firſt to have <hi>prov'd,</hi> before he had ſo roundly and uncharitably <hi>chargd</hi> us with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 30. He aſks if our Women are not as capable of being taught as the <hi>French</hi> Women? I anſwer in the Affirmative, and beg he would tell me, who ever made a Queſtion of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 36. Upon Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi>'s obſerving, what indeed is but too true, that the Men-Midwife's being ſent for, ſo <hi>late,</hi> too often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Self-ſufficiency</hi> of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0218202800:18"/>the <hi>Midwife,</hi> he excuſes them, by affirming, that it is oftener from the <hi>Modeſty</hi> of the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Covetouſneſs,</hi> or real <hi>Poverty</hi> of the <hi>Men,</hi> &amp;c. Thus you fee his <hi>Pupils,</hi> the <hi>Midwomen,</hi> are infallible, and the Saddle is to be plac'd on <hi>any</hi> Horſe rather than the <hi>right</hi> one. Had Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> long <hi>practis'd</hi> the Art of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery,</hi> he would have been ſufficiently ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that many Men-Midwives have been hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd from being ſent for in Caſes of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Extremity, where the <hi>Sufferers</hi> were <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> enough to have had ſuperior Advice, and the <hi>Huſbands</hi> neither <hi>covetous</hi> nor <hi>poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 39. He ſays, it is true that Women may be taught the Method of touching with <hi>very little Trouble.</hi> Now if he makes the ſame Conceſſion in relation to the other Branches of <hi>Midwifery,</hi> it is to be hop'd his <hi>Lectures</hi> may be heard at a <hi>very little Expence,</hi> which is a Conſequence poſſibly he was not aware of.</p>
            <p>From Mr. <hi>Giffard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> advances to take notice of my own <hi>Eſſay</hi> upon <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery,</hi> firſt publiſh'd in 1733. and after I have dwelt ſo long in defending the Character of the two fore-mention'd Gentlemen, whoſe Shades are no way able to anſwer for themſelves, I hope I ſhall not be thought too partial if I ſhould now endeavour to defend my own, againſt Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi>'s trifling and unjuſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0218202800:19"/>
            <p>In the firſt place, he charges me with <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimenting</hi> the Midwomen, becauſe I wrote a Book for their Improvement, and thought that all the Treatiſes, hitherto written on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, were calculated more for the Inſtruction of my own Sex than the other. <hi>Pag.</hi> 41. This he affirms to be a <hi>Miſtake,</hi> becauſe, he ſays, Madam <hi>Du Tertre</hi> compoſed her Book for the Uſe of the Midwives Apprentices in the <hi>Hotel Dieu,</hi> and Madam <hi>Lovys Burgeois</hi>'s Book was tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and put forth for the ſole Uſe of <hi>Midwives.</hi> Now as to the firſt, I preſume it never was tranſlated (from his own Pretenſions to undertake it) and I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to underſtand the <hi>French</hi> Language. As to the other, I never ſaw it, or heard of it before.</p>
            <p>Upon my ſaying, <q>"That I have daily, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Space of above twenty Years Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, ſeen many fatal Miſtakes committed by Midwives,"</q> he aſks, what Sort of Midwives theſe muſt have been, who committed fatal Miſtakes, <hi>every Day,</hi> for above twenty Years together? By Daily, I did not think I ſhould be underſtood every particular Day, but that I had frequently ſeen ſuch fatal Practices, as himſelf doubtleſs <hi>would,</hi> had he ever been converſant in the Practice of that <hi>Art</hi> he would have the World believe him ſo expert in. Nor can I help obſerving in this Place, that Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> cannot be a proper Perſon to inſtruct <hi>others,</hi> as not being Maſter of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0218202800:20"/>the Art <hi>himſelf.</hi> He then puts a Quere, how are the <hi>civil Magiſtrates</hi> to be appriz'd of their <hi>Mal-practice,</hi> if the honeſt <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of ſuch as are call'd in upon them, and are <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> of it, are not to be regarded? How are the Women themſelves to be made ſenſible of their <hi>Errors</hi> if their Superiors are denied the Liberty of <hi>reproving</hi> them, when <hi>faulty,</hi> and freely profeſſing the <hi>Truth?</hi> If the <hi>Men</hi> are to be blam'd for their <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Impartiality,</hi> and accus'd of hauling the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>Head and Shoulders, guilty</hi> or not <hi>guilty,</hi> whenever they blame the Midwives for their <hi>Faults,</hi> Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi>'s Quere, in relation to the <hi>civil Magiſtrates,</hi> is like for ever to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unanſwer'd.</p>
            <p>Again, upon my delivering it as my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <q>"That ſuch Miſtakes could not have happen'd had they ever read a Treatiſe ſo properly adapted to their Capacities, and at the ſame time ſo full and plain as I hop'd my own to be,"</q> he aſks, with his wonted Candour, whether, if they had read Madam <hi>Du Tertre</hi>'s little Book, they would not have found it more properly adapted to their Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, as full and plain, and her Sentiments more accurately expreſſed? To which I reply, as having never <hi>ſeen,</hi> nor been able to <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> her Book, if I had; <hi>that I cannot tell.</hi> Tho' at the ſame time I muſt, in juſtice to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, obſerve, that I cannot ſee what relation this has to the Matter in Diſpute; nor can Madam <hi>Du Tertre</hi>s little Book, being as full
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0218202800:21"/>and plain, or more accurately expreſs'd, than mine, hinder mine from being <hi>full</hi> and <hi>plain</hi> too, which is all that I have aſſerted.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if <hi>forty</hi> Perſons, as well as Madam <hi>Du Tertre,</hi> had made the ſame Improvements and Obſervations in Practice, and wrote them in a <hi>Language</hi> I do not underſtand how does that <hi>detract</hi> from, or <hi>leſſen</hi> any thing I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance? A candid Perſon would think that it rather <hi>confirmd</hi> it.</p>
            <p>In the next place he taxes me with having the ſame Aim he has the Aſſurance to aſſert Dr. <hi>Chamberlen</hi> had; namely, <hi>to tell the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, when, and in what particular Caſes to ſend for my ſuperior Advice, and not to inſtruct them how to give better Aſſiſtance themſelves.</hi> After the very indecent Freedom he has taken with the Character of Dr. <hi>Chamberlen,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wonder at any he can take with <hi>mine,</hi> as moſt willingly owning my own Inferiority. But before Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> had tax'd me with this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Way of proceeding, he ought to have been better acquainted with me than he ſeems to be, and to have prov'd, <hi>that I have not laid down any Rules for the Improvement and Advantage of Midwives.</hi> Will he affirm that I have advanc'd <hi>nothing</hi> towards their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? If ſo, let him ingenuouſly prove it, not by low and impertinent <hi>Cavils,</hi> but <hi>cool</hi> and <hi>ſober Arguments,</hi> and not arrogate to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Offices of both <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Executioner,</hi> in a Cauſe wherein he appears only as an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0218202800:22"/>and I doubt not, but that before I have done pleading, the <hi>Court</hi> of impartial <hi>Readers</hi> will look upon his <hi>Proſecution</hi> as entirely <hi>mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> and readily grant me a <hi>Copy</hi> of my <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement.</hi> Does not he own that Madam <hi>Du Tertre</hi> and <hi>myſelf</hi> have advanc'd the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Practice? And does not he highly extol many Things in <hi>her</hi> Treatiſe which are found in <hi>mine?</hi> Since then we have liv'd in different Ages, and have never had the leaſt Knowledge of one another, how can that Practice be eſteem'd <hi>bad</hi> in <hi>me,</hi> which is reckon'd ſo <hi>extraordinary</hi> in Madam <hi>Du Tertre?</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Pag.</hi> 43. He accuſes me of firſt <hi>coaxing,</hi> and then <hi>threatening</hi> the Midwives, as Dr. <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlen</hi> did before me, becauſe I ſay, <q>"I have ever found the moſt experienced Midwives the moſt ready to call in farther Aſſiſtance, and that they find their Account in it; whilſt it is quite otherwiſe with thoſe, who, from too great an Opinion of their own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Abilities, run great Hazards, or at the beſt call us in too late, and ſo loſe their good Name, and juſtly ſuffer in their Reputation. That the beſt Midwives ſend early for Advice upon Appearance of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Difficulty; the ſuffering Fair readily conſents to it, and by this means both Lives are ſav'd."</q> Pray who can ſee any thing in this Paſſage like <hi>coaxing</hi> or <hi>threatening,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any thing elſe, but <hi>plain</hi> and known <hi>Truth?</hi> I would deſire to know, who <hi>coaxes</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0218202800:23"/>the Women, when he immediately aſks, <q>"if the ſuffering Fair would not have been much more oblig'd to her <hi>Midwoman,</hi> if ſhe had perform'd the Work herſelf, and thereby ſav'd both the <hi>Uneaſineſs</hi> and <hi>Expence</hi> of ſuperior Advice."</q> Of the firſt Part of this Accuſation then, he appears to be guilty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the Reader need not be at a Loſs for the Reaſon of it. But as for <hi>threatening,</hi> that was not Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi>s Intention at a Time when he was beſpeaking them for his <hi>Pupils;</hi> for it muſt be a very ſilly Bird indeed, that, according to the Proverb, bewrays its <hi>own</hi> Neſt. He likewiſe deſires to know, <q>"If theſe two Speeches were not pick'd out of Dr. <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlen</hi>'s Preface?"</q> I anſwer, <hi>No;</hi> but muſt beg leave to ſubjoin, that I ſhall never have the worſe Opinion of myſelf for thinking alike with ſo <hi>great</hi> a Man, notwithſtanding Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> is pleas'd to give him the Title of a <hi>puzzling, confounding, inſinuating, inſolent Noſtrum-monger.</hi>

            <p>Upon my faying, <q>"That I have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of my own to extract Children when the <hi>Head</hi> preſents and ſticks in the Paſſage, with the <hi>Fillet,</hi> which I muſt beg leave to be ſilent in, as the great Dr. <hi>Chamberlen</hi> was before me, in chuſing to conceal the Method whereby he could extract Children in this Caſe without <hi>Hooks,</hi> where other Artiſts are forc'd to uſe them,"</q> he adds, <hi>was there ever ſuch an Excuſe beard of?</hi> Becauſe the great Dr. <hi>Chamberlen,</hi> ſays he, acted a very

Then he aſks, whether I might not as well have ſaid, <hi>That the Doctor had been guilty of Simony or Sacrilege, and was not puniſh'd for it, and therefore I might, for the ſame Reaſon, expect the ſame Grace, in caſe I ſhould ever take it in my Head to commit the ſame Crimes?</hi> Not remembering his former Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Pag.</hi> 20. <hi>Of his being far from thinking that the Publick has any Right to expect, that every private Man (who at a conſiderable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and aſſiduous Study, makes any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſcovery in Manual Operations which cannot be made univerſally uſeful, as Medicines may, and really are,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>ſhould communicate</hi> gratis <hi>the Fruits of his Labour and Expence.</hi> Beſides at the ſame time that I keep the <hi>Fillet</hi> a Secret, I frankly own the <hi>Forceps</hi> to be preferable, for which I give my Reaſons. How then can the Concealment of the former be an Injury to any?</p>
            <p>A little after, <hi>Pag.</hi> 45. he taxes me with being miſtaken, in <hi>affirming,</hi> that I was the ſecond <hi>Engliſhman</hi> who wrote originally and profeſſedly on this Subject.

                  <hi>Eſſay on Midwifery,</hi> firſt Edit. <hi>Preface,</hi> laſt Page but one.</note> This I afterwards was ſenſible of, and accordingly candidly own'd it, in my ſecond Edition, in this following Words,<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Second Edit. <hi>Preface,</hi> p. 22.</note> 
               <hi>When I publiſh'd the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0218202800:25"/>firſt Edition of this Work, I thought myſelf, at leaſt, the ſecond</hi> Engliſhman, <hi>who had written profeſſedly on the Subject; I have ſince found I was miſtaken,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> himſelf is here guilty of a <hi>Miſtake,</hi> if not a wilful <hi>Miſrepreſentation.</hi> Tho' whether I was right or wrong in this, 'tis nothing to the Subject Matter, and at beſt but a low and trifling <hi>Cavil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon my ſaying, if the Child offers any other Part than the <hi>Head,</hi> be it what it will, the Hand is to be paſs'd gently into the Womb, the Feet are to be ſearch'd for, the Child to be turn'd, and that Way brought forth; and <hi>Pag.</hi> 20. Having farther obſerv'd, that a Child, preſenting with its <hi>Head,</hi> is often to be turn'd and deliver'd with the <hi>Feet</hi> firſt, and in all other Poſtures whatever always with the <hi>Feet</hi> firſt, Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> proceeds, But ſuppoſe a <hi>Foot,</hi> or the <hi>Feet</hi> preſent, what need have we then to paſs the Hand into the Womb to fetch them? And ſuppoſe the <hi>Buttocks</hi> preſent, and are ſo low in the Paſſage that they cannot be puſh'd back without Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, is it not much eaſier and quicker to ſlip the Fingers over the Bend of the <hi>Thigh,</hi> or over the <hi>Oſſa Ilia,</hi> and draw it forward in that Poſture, than to run the riſque of forcing them back to come at the <hi>Feet?</hi> And then trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly concludes it to be plain from theſe Quotations, <hi>That I, notwithſtanding my</hi> 25 <hi>Years Practice, was perfectly unacquainted with this Caſe, tho' Madam</hi> Du Tertre <hi>deſcribes it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0218202800:26"/>very accurately.</hi> I have ſaid in my <hi>firſt</hi> Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>except when it preſents with the Feet,</hi> &amp;c. And, in my <hi>ſecond,</hi> have mention'd the <hi>Buttocks,</hi> and when the Child may be brought away in that Poſture. <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. I own there (by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that Caſe an <hi>Exception</hi>) that this had ſlipp'd me in the firſt, ſo that nothing is more plain, than that I was not <hi>unacquainted</hi> with the Caſe, tho' Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> is pleaſed, with his uſual <hi>Candour,</hi> to accuſe me of being <hi>perfectly</hi> ſo. No Perſon can poſſibly imagine a Caſe of that Nature ſhould never happen to me in twenty ſeven Years extenſive Practice. And tho' I forgot to take notice of it in the <hi>Eſſay,</hi> yet I have ſufficiently mention'd it in my <hi>Treatiſe.</hi> So that if the <hi>former</hi> had been much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in this reſpect than it is, yet as it ſtands corrected in the <hi>latter,</hi> it muſt certainly be very unfair and ungenerous to fix upon any but the <hi>laſt</hi> Edition.</p>
            <p>Upon my giving an Account of having with my Finger dilated and caſt back the Mouth of the Womb, and ſo releas'd a little Priſoner, he aſks, if Madam <hi>Du Tertre</hi>'s Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger would not have releaſed the Priſoner as ſoon, and as ſafely as mine? <hi>Pag.</hi> 47. Upon my ſaying again, that more than <hi>two</hi> Inches of the String itſelf, from the Navel, is unneceſſary, whereas I have commonly known Midwives leave <hi>five</hi> or <hi>ſix,</hi> he adds; that Madam <hi>Du Tertre</hi> likewiſe adviſes the String to be tied two Inches from the Child's Navel, and then
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0218202800:27"/>triumphs in the following Manner, <hi>Where now is the mighty Secret he makes ſuch a</hi> FUSS <hi>about? Is it any thing more than an</hi> OLD WOMAN <hi>told us before he was born? Pag.</hi> 48. Upon ſaying too, that it is my conſtant Practice to paſs my Hand immediately after the Birth, in order to extract the <hi>Placenta;</hi> he enquires what there is ſo extraordinary in it, that it deſerves to be noted ſo emphatically, <hi>as my conſtant Practice is?</hi> And then aſks if Madam <hi>Du Tertre,</hi> &amp;c. did not ſo? <hi>Pag.</hi> 56. Again, he twits Dr. <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi> as well as myſelf, with Madam <hi>Du Tertre,</hi> as likewiſe in <hi>Pag.</hi> 59. And laſtly, <hi>Pag.</hi> 61. Upon my declaring my Unwillingneſs to put a Perſon upon her Labour too early, which God knows is too often done, he aſks if Madam <hi>Du Tertre</hi> would not as carefully have avoided putting her upon her Labour before her Time, as I did?</p>
            <p>As for Madam <hi>Du Tertre</hi> and myſelf being of the ſame Opinion, I cannot poſſibly ſee how he can fairly turn that to my Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, ſince what is <hi>right</hi> in Madam <hi>Du Tertre</hi> can never be <hi>wrong</hi> in me. So that inſtead of doing me an <hi>Injury,</hi> which I think was plainly his Intention, by ſuch trifling Inſinuations, he has paid me a handſome <hi>Compliment,</hi> in own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Practice to be the ſame with Madam <hi>Du Tertre</hi>'s whom he ſeems to be ſo very fond of.</p>
            <p>To return; <hi>Pag.</hi> 47. After repeating what I have ſaid in relation to the Folly of dipping
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0218202800:28"/>the Infant's Hand, when hanging out of the Womb, in cold Water, rubbing it with Ice, or touching it with a wet Cloth, which ſome ignorant Midwives practiſe, he deſires to be inform'd, <q>"how many Midwives I have ever known guilty of theſe Fooleries?"</q> I anſwer too many; and it is probable, had Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> long practiſed the Art of Midwifery, he would have, met with the ſame.</p>
            <p>A much greater Inſtance, of his being but little converſant in this Art, he gives us in the very next Page, where, upon my ſaying that few Midwives are ſufficiently appriz'd of the unhappy Symptom there mention'd, <hi>viz.</hi> a violent <hi>Flooding,</hi> he declares, that he differs ſo far from me, in this Aſſertion, that, in his Opinion, there is not <hi>one</hi> Midwife in a <hi>thouſand</hi> who knows not, that a violent Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will either occaſion Abortion or Death. I confeſs few, if any Midwives, can be ſo totally ignorant, as not to know that <hi>Flooding</hi> will occaſion Death if no Stop be put to its Fury. Yet many are apt to flatter themſelves, that the Sufferer may be deliver'd by her natural Pains, till it is too late, as appears from ſeveral Caſes I have cited (few to what I could have given) which ſhews they were not ſufficiently appriz'd of the Danger. And I hope I may be excuſed being ſo full on this Head, as many have been before me, ſince it is a Thing of ſuch vaſt Conſequence in <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0218202800:29"/>
            <p>But to return back to Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi>'s Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in relation to what I advanc'd about the <hi>Navel-ſtring, Pag.</hi> 48. I thought it proper to mention what I have there ſaid, as I had very often found the leaving ſo much of the String to be a common Practice, and indeed the Cuſtom, of moſt Midwives in the Country. I never once mention'd it as a <hi>Secret;</hi> ſo the FUSS about it, as he <hi>elegantly</hi> words it, is with <hi>himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, as to his Quere, whether it is not every Body's Practice to paſs their Hand immediately and examine if there are any more Children, and if no more, to fetch the <hi>Placenta?</hi> I anſwer No; not even among the Aſſiſtants of my <hi>own</hi> Sex, much leſs with the <hi>Women,</hi> for I aſſert that few of them take this Method.</p>
            <p>Few Midwives, even in this <hi>Town,</hi> paſs their Hand (if I may give credit to <hi>their</hi> Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and my own <hi>Experience</hi>) and fewer yet in the Country. So that the Woman in whoſe Caſe this is mention'd had really ſtood but a bad Chance; had an ignorant Midwife been call'd in upon her, as I have there affirm'd. Here Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> has certainly burnt his Fingers, and taken hold of one of the beſt Obſervations in my whole Book; which may ſerve to ſhew his extraordinary <hi>Judgment.</hi> That few Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives in this Town do paſs their Hand is an
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0218202800:30"/>Affirmation I dare ſubmit to the Chief of the Profeſſion. Pray whence comes it that we are ſo often ſent for to extract the <hi>Placenta?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not what I have wrote on this Subject Matter of <hi>Inſtruction</hi> to Midwives? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it is againſt my own Intereſt, it muſt be judg'd to be <hi>honeſt</hi> at leaſt, which, I truſt will have no ſmall Weight in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>If I have written any thing that will not ſtand the Teſt, but that my <hi>Herculean</hi> Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt does not pretend to, why do not proper Judges diſprove me? If nothing but what will ſtand the Trial, why muſt I be loaded with ſuch trifling and malicious <hi>Cavils?</hi> Really I think no one more unhappy, than he who <hi>ſnarls,</hi> and ſhews his <hi>Teeth,</hi> yet cannot <hi>bite;</hi> and I at once deſpiſe and pity ſuch a Perſon.</p>
            <p>All Midwives are not <hi>Du Tertre</hi>'s; and why I ſhould not ſay, <hi>this is my conſtant Practice,</hi> I know not; nor do I ſee wherein I could offend any Perſon thereby (and nothing ſurely but <hi>Calumny and Ill-nature</hi> could ever have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted a Cenſure from this.) How wrongfully then does he accuſe me of having condemn'd the Midwives unjuſtly, becauſe I affirm, that if an ignorant Midwife had been concern'd in the Caſe abovementioned, who had only taken the firſt Child and After-birth, the laſt would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0218202800:31"/>have been left behind, and either violent Flooding, or a bad Fever would have enſued; and, as the Woman was before ill, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly weak, it would very likely have coſt her her Life? Is not what I have ſaid <hi>true?</hi> Can what is here ſpoken, of an <hi>ignorant</hi> Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, belong to a <hi>good</hi> one? And would not one, ignorant of her Profeſſion, have occaſion'd in all Probability the Misfortune I there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? For I ſay again, that few do paſs their Hand. Upon the whole then, I think I may with moſt Juſtice retort his own Words upon him, and apply what he ſays of the Midwives to myſelf, <hi>viz. That, guilty or not guilty, 'tis all one,</hi> I muſt be <hi>haul'd in, and condemn'd for an imaginary as well as a real Fault.</hi> Pag. 50.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 51. He relates the Caſe of my being ſent for to a Gentlewoman who kept a Tavern at <hi>Ipſwich, viz.</hi> that the Child was <hi>dead,</hi> and the Mother <hi>flooding;</hi> that when two Midwives and a <hi>Surgeon,</hi> juſt then ſet out in the Profeſſion, had all us'd their Endeavours to little or no Purpoſe, I was call'd in, and deliver'd her in a Minute; that I left her under the Care of Dr. <hi>Beeſton,</hi> but that ſhe died in ſix or ſeven Days. Upon this he very candidly obſerves, that I have not indeed told this young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Name, tho' I have deſcrib'd him ſo well that he doubts there's not a Man in all <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> nor perhaps <hi>twenty</hi> Miles round, but can tell who I mean; and then craftily inſinuates, <hi>What Injury might not ſuch a Tale do a worthy
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0218202800:32"/>young Fellow?</hi> And twits me with being incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with myſelf, in relation to the Advice I gave in <hi>Pag.</hi> 114. of my firſt Edition; namely, that we ſhould not take an unkind Advantage of a Slip or Accident that may happen to befal a Brother in his Practice.</p>
            <p>I hope I cannot fairly be charg'd with being inconſiſtent with myſelf, or taking an unkind Advantage of a Brother, whereas the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Eſſay was many Years after the Caſe referr'd to, and the young Surgeon there mention'd, had in all Probability, either given up that Branch of Practice, or was well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in it.</p>
            <p>In the next Page he cites a Paſſage from my <hi>Preface,</hi> wherein I ſay that the Dignity of this Art will appear to every Perſon in a much more advantageous Light, if we reflect on the Learning of the Profeſſors of it, and then ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiouſly ſubjoins, <hi>E. G.</hi> Dr. <hi>C</hi>—, Dr. <hi>M</hi>—, Dr. <hi>W</hi>—, Dr. <hi>G</hi>—, Dr. <hi>A</hi>—, Dr. <hi>B</hi>—, Dr. <hi>Gregoire, Tota notus in Urbe!</hi> &amp;c. It is much to be wiſh'd that Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> had condeſcended ſo far as to have fill'd up this formidable Catalogue of Blanks, that the Gentlemen, he there reflects upon, might have a fair Opportunity of defending themſelves from ſuch ſcurrilous Treatment. Is this being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with himſelf, to charge me with <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting from a young Surgeon</hi>'s <hi>Character,</hi> in ſo <hi>favourable</hi> a Manner; as not to give even the initial Letter of his Name; when in the very
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0218202800:33"/>next Paragraph, he uncharitably and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inſults the Reputation of no leſs than ſeven Phyſicians, as he himſelf ſeems to own, by giving them all the Title of Doctor; but if by this he would only aim at thoſe who would willingly impoſe themſelves upon the World as ſuch, he ſhould have told us their real Names, that Gentlemen of Learning and Character may not ſuffer thereby; there being ſeveral Phyſicians of Reputation in this City, the initial Letters of whoſe Names are the <hi>ſame</hi> he has thought fit to ſet down.</p>
            <p>Upon my ſaying, that the Improvements theſe, great Men have made in this Art, have effectually wip'd away the Load of Slander and Ignominy, with which this Profeſſion was formerly branded, he has the <hi>Aſſurance</hi> to aſk, for I can call it nothing elſe, if <hi>ninety nine</hi> in a <hi>hundred</hi> (a pretty large Proportion truly) of theſe great Men I talk of, have not kept their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements to themſelves? With this inſinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Doubt, <hi>if ever they made any.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if this be not ſcurrilous Treatment, I know not what can poſſibly be ſo. But this is not all, he proceeds farther, and aſks if moſt of them now, as well as myſelf, don't pretend to have Secrets? And if they don't endeavour to <hi>puzzle,</hi> at the ſame time they make a ſhow of <hi>inſtructing</hi> others? Don't they, ſays he likewiſe, <hi>very ſeldom, if ever, conſult together, as they always ought to do in difficult or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0218202800:34"/>dangerous Caſes?</hi> And then aſks, <hi>What can hinder them, except the Fear of diſcovering the Inſignificancy of their pretended Secret, or their</hi> REAL IGNORANCE? What intolerable Uſage is here? What Opinion muſt By-ſtanders have of the Profeſſion, when one, who would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf upon the Town as a <hi>Judge,</hi> repreſents the Profeſſors of it as a Set of <hi>crafty, puzzling, ignorant</hi> People? How far his Fellow Citizens are to thank him, for deterring, by falſe and malicious Hints, thoſe who are already (from a miſtaken and blameable Modeſty) too averſe to the Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Men-Midwives, in Caſes of Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, where a faithful <hi>Wife,</hi> or hopeful <hi>Heir</hi> may perhaps be loſt, is what I think every reaſonable Man may determine. But I ſhall leave him to the Reſentment of thoſe worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen he has ſo much inſulted, and only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve farther on this Head, that I well hop'd, (and ſtill with Reaſon do) that the late, and preſent Practitioners, had wip'd off the Load of Scandal that was us'd to blacken this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and deſign'd a juſt Compliment to them. But nothing can ſtand good where <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Ill-nature</hi> meet. And indeed if they have not done it, I can only be accus'd of being too <hi>complaiſant;</hi> which is a Fault I muſt do Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> the Juſtice to own he has no where in his Book been guilty of, unleſs once to his Friend and <hi>Countryman,</hi> Dr. <hi>Mitchell,</hi> as will preſently be made appear.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0218202800:35"/>
            <p>Upon my ſaying, in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Edition of my Book, that I did not ſend my Papers to the <hi>Preſs</hi> till I had got a Friend to reviſe and correct the <hi>Diction,</hi> which I believe is not an uſual thing, he deſires to he inform'd, if I can be a tolerable Judge of <hi>Diction</hi> myſelf, who have ſuffer'd my Friend to write <hi>Woman-Midwife, Women-Midwives,</hi> &amp;c. and then blames me, or my <hi>Corrector,</hi> for calling Dr. <hi>Maubray</hi> an ingenious and laborious Author, endeavouring, at the ſame time, to ſet the <hi>Doctor</hi> in a very ridiculous Light. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Dr. <hi>Maubray</hi> to be as ſilly a Writer as Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> would have him, he muſt own at leaſt, that I have ſome <hi>Good-nature</hi> in me (to which Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> ſeems to be a Stranger) to allow him a Character he did not well deſerve. I ſhall always endeavour to ſpeak with <hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Reſpect</hi> of my <hi>Superiors;</hi> not following Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi>'s Example in recommending and puffing myſelf to the Town, as the only <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> left in my Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>After Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> has vented his Spleen upon the Doctor, he triumphs in the following Manner. <q>"Pray does ſuch a Writer as this deſerve the Epithets of <hi>ingenious</hi> and <hi>labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious?</hi> Wherein does his <hi>Ingenuity</hi> appear? Wherein is his Labour of any Uſe? Pray can any thing expoſe a Man's Judgment more than <hi>laughing</hi> or <hi>hiſſing, praiſing</hi> or <hi>finding fault</hi> in the <hi>wrong</hi> Place" <bibl>
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 56.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0218202800:36"/>
            <p>Without doubt Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> has Penetration enough to avoid thoſe <hi>Sands</hi> in which he ſees others <hi>ſink;</hi> and ſo great a <hi>Reformer</hi> as himſelf can never be ſuſpected of being guilty of thoſe Faults he ſo vehemently reproves in others. But to judge him now by his own Words. He reprimands me for calling Dr. <hi>Maubray,</hi> an <hi>ingenious</hi> and <hi>laborious Author,</hi> and at the ſame time gives the late Dr. <hi>Mitchell</hi> the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets, of a <hi>juſt, tart, reverend,</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> Writer. After what I have advanc'd above, in relation to Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi>'s very ill Uſage of the Gentlemen of the <hi>Faculty,</hi> it may ſeem odd perhaps, that I ſhould here queſtion the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of any Gentleman myſelf; nor ſhould any thing have induc'd me to it, had I not here a very fair Opportunity to diſplay Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi>'s great Partiality. In order to which I appeal to all the Phyſicians in this Town, to whom the LEARNED Dr. <hi>Mitchell,</hi> as he calls him, was but too well known, whether he was not the great <hi>Phyſical-fool</hi> of the Age? The <hi>ſtanding Jeſt</hi> of all his Acquaintance? Tho' ſome Men of Senſe thought him too low even for that, And as for his SOOTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KIN DISSECTED, wherein, Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> ſays, he has ſo JUSTLY and TARTLY reprimanded Dr. <hi>Maubray</hi> (who certainly deſerv'd it for ſuch a falſe and credulous Surmiſe as the Exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the <hi>Suyger</hi> or <hi>Sucher,</hi> had Dr. <hi>Mitchell</hi> been able to have done it) it is too well known, for its execrable Stupidity, to need any Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in this Place. For the Truth of which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0218202800:37"/>I'll ſtand by the Determination of the moſt <hi>partial</hi> Reader that ever perus'd this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Performance, excepting only Mr. <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> who, if he went thro' it with a <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd</hi> Countenance, is, I believe, the only one that ever did. Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> too aſſures us, that he was, <hi>Utriuſque Medicinae Doctor. P.</hi> 55. Greatly to the Honour of both the Profeſſions no doubt! Pray was not deſiring him to ſhew his <hi>Diploma,</hi> which ſome Gentlemen of top Reputation thought to be a <hi>ſham</hi> one, a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jeſt at <hi>Child</hi>'s? Was it not always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd with the utmoſt Shame and Reluctance?</p>
            <p>Now to retort Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi>'s Words upon himſelf, which may be done with the utmoſt Juſtice; pray does ſuch a Writer as this deſerve the Epithets of <hi>juſt, tart, reverend,</hi> or <hi>learned? Riſum teneatis?</hi> Wherein does his <hi>Tartneſs</hi> or <hi>Learning</hi> appear? Pray can any thing expoſe a Man's <hi>Judgment</hi> more than <hi>laughing</hi> or <hi>hiſſing, praiſing</hi> or <hi>finding fault</hi> in the <hi>wrong Place?</hi> And pray who would think Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> a Judge of <hi>Learning</hi> himſelf, who calls ſuch a Writer as this, a LEARNED one?</p>
            <p>But to return; what had I to do with Dr. <hi>Maubray</hi>'s Treatiſe, beyond what belong'd to my Subject? He might be very <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>laborious,</hi> yet <hi>erroneous</hi> too; as I prove he was in relation to the <hi>Forceps,</hi> in which being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to be cloſe upon him, I thought I could do no leſs than do him Juſtice where I found him right. I had no Buſineſs rudely to rake into
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0218202800:38"/>his Aſhes, neither was I anſwering or writing againſt his Book. Beſides, I ſhew'd him the more Reſpect, from hearing him well ſpoken of by better Judges than Mr. <hi>John Douglaſs,</hi> or myſelf. Nor could I imagine a Piece of <hi>juſt Civility</hi> would ever have been made ſo ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd an Uſe of by any, much leſs by the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s own <hi>Countryman.</hi> Had I treated Dr. <hi>Maubray</hi> with the ungentlemanlike Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> has Dr. <hi>Chamherlen,</hi> he might then, and I doubt not would, have fallen upon me for that too. So that <hi>civil</hi> or <hi>uncivil, guilty</hi> or <hi>not guilty,</hi> I muſt be <hi>haul'd in,</hi> as he ſays the <hi>Midwomen</hi> are, by the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Shoulders. Pag.</hi> 55. He hopes I will explain the Doctor's Account of Men being chang'd into Women, in my next Edition, for he owns, as it ſtands in the Doctor's Book, it is far beyond his Comprehenſion; and that the Account he gives of it is ſo ſublime, that it rather <hi>puzzles</hi> than <hi>inſtructs</hi> him. But in the Name of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what is all this to me? What have I to do to explain in any Author that which is foreign to my Subject. If I am to anſwer for all the <hi>ſilly</hi> or <hi>wrong</hi> things that are advanc'd in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi> I ſhall have enough to do with a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>He ſays I make a great SPLUTTER (elegant indeed!) about breaking the Membranes of the ſecond Child, in Order to bring it away by the Feet, as if I had diſcover'd ſomething new. But however, to make me ſome amends, he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0218202800:39"/>immediately pays me a great Compliment, by obſerving that Dr. <hi>Maubray</hi>'s Words on this Occaſion, which, he ſays, are perfect NONSENSE, are very <hi>different from mine;</hi> which, as it is the only Place in his whole Book wherein he ſeems to have any tolerable Opinion of me, I would not be thought ſo <hi>ungrateful</hi> as not to take ſome notice of it. I never imagin'd that in this Caſe I had diſcover'd any thing new; and what I there ſaid was for the Information of Women, who moſt of them, if not all, leave the Birth of the ſecond Child to <hi>Nature.</hi> So that I think his own very genteel SPLUTTER might have been as well omitted.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Page he aſks, <q>"Who ever call'd the Flowing of the Waters a Flooding, but myſelf."</q> And obſerves, that every body elſe means a dangerous Flux of Blood by a Flooding. I never did call the <hi>Flowing of the Waters</hi> a <hi>Flooding.</hi> It's a baſe and falſe Charge. Pray have not I taken notice, that the <hi>Flowing of the Waters</hi> was wrongfully call'd a <hi>Flooding?</hi> What Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> then has here ſaid might have been let alone. I could as eaſily have call'd it NONSENSE as himſelf.</p>
            <p>Again, becauſe I honeſtly and earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the careful Extraction of the <hi>Placenta,</hi> which can never be left behind without the greateſt Danger, he obſerves, <hi>Pag.</hi> 57. after his <hi>Laconick</hi> Manner, that I make a great ROUT about it for three Pages together, as if no body had known any thing of the Matter before;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0218202800:40"/>and upon my ſaying that I am glad to find Dr. <hi>Maubray</hi> recommending ſo ſafe a Practice, he aſks, <q>"If I can find any body who does not recommend it, as well as Dr. <hi>Maubray</hi> and myſelf?"</q> Let who will <hi>recommend</hi> or <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recommend</hi> it, I'm ſure I have found ſeveral that don't <hi>practiſe</hi> it, to the endangering of their Patients Lives; and to prevent ſuch ill Conſequences for the future, Was the Reaſon of my making ſuch a ROUT about it, or rather ſo faithfully and earneſtly recommending it.</p>
            <p>I ſtill aſſert that the <hi>Placenta</hi> is often left by <hi>Midwives,</hi> and for their Inſtruction alone, it was I ſpoke ſo much about it. How-then can what I have ſaid be call'd a ROUT? But Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> muſt neceſſarily be <hi>elegant</hi> if he writes at all.</p>
            <p>He affirms in the ſame <hi>Pag.</hi> 57. That I have cenſur'd <hi>Dionis,</hi> which I think, I have done with a deal of Juſtice, for ſaying, <q>"That the <hi>Placenta</hi> in an Abortion of two or three Months may be left to come away of itſelf,"</q> and then replies, That undoubtedly this may very often be done without ANY Danger, tho' he adds, that it is certainly SAPER to bring it away at firſt, if ſent for in Time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſeems to me to be <hi>Nonſenſe;</hi> for if it he <hi>ſafer</hi> to bring it away at firſt, how can it be left without <hi>any</hi> Danger? Does not the Word <hi>ſafer</hi> naturally imply a1 Danger in its being left behind? If not, how can one Practice be <hi>ſafer</hi> than the other. If the Child has been come away ſome Time,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0218202800:41"/>he ſays, he ſhould give himſelf no Trouble about it till a Flooding appear'd, and affirms, that he knew it once left whole (by the Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of the Mother, who could by no means be perſuaded to have it taken away) between the fourth and fifth Month, and yet ſhe did very well. Whether the Words, <hi>I knew it once,</hi> were here meant to ſignify his own prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing of this Art, I cannot determine; but he himſelf ſeems to think this Practice <hi>wrong</hi> by <hi>blaming</hi> the Woman with <hi>Obſtinacy,</hi> for not conſenting to have it taken away. Indeed, as he ſays, ſhe might notwithſtanding this have done well; but then it was certainly great odds ſhe might not, and her Recovery was doubtleſs more owing to good luck than any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>He ſays the experienc'd Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> is alſo of the ſame Opinion, when he obſerves, <q>"That of two Evils the greater ought to be ſhunn'd, there being leſs Danger in leaving Part of the After-birth, which will very often, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any great harm, come away with the <hi>Lochia,</hi> than in uſing any force in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting it, by which we very often hurt the Womb."</q> Without doubt of <hi>two</hi> Evils the <hi>leſſer</hi> ought always to be choſen; but I think Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi>'s Words are here to be taken with great Reſtriction. For his ſaying that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Part of the <hi>Placenta</hi> will <hi>often</hi> come away with the <hi>Lochia,</hi> implies that it will not <hi>always</hi> do ſo; and that it will do no <hi>great harm</hi> plainly intimates that it may do <hi>ſome.</hi> The <hi>Womb</hi> to be ſure is never to be hurt,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0218202800:42"/>in extracting the <hi>Placenta;</hi> and when it cannot be got away, without doing more harm than the Retention of it may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (which I believe but ſeldom happens) it muſt doubtleſs be left behind. But then this is nothing to the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of its being always taken away, which is what I have ſo earneſtly recommended. Will Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> affirm, that it is ever ſafer to have it <hi>retain'd,</hi> than <hi>extracted?</hi> I hope he will not pretend to give this Advice in his <hi>Lectures,</hi> leſt Mankind ſhould be but little indebted to him, and the State of <hi>Midwifery,</hi> after his mighty Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to reform it, be left in a much worſe Condition than he found it. This ought to be look'd upon as one of the moſt certain <hi>Maxims</hi> in Practice, that, where it can poſſibly be done, the Womb ought to be clear'd, and nothing ſuffer'd to be included in it, leſt a <hi>Fever</hi> or <hi>Flooding</hi> ſhould enſue, which are but too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the Conſequences of ſuch a Neglect.</p>
            <p>A little after, he ſays, I give one Inſtance of a Child I deliver'd with the <hi>Buttocks</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and then aſks, how does this <hi>quadrate,</hi> with what I ſay, <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. of the ſame Book. <q>"If the Child offers any other part than the Head, the Hand is to be paſſed into the, Womb, the Feet ſearch'd for, and the Child, to be turn'd, and brought forth by them."</q> Here he wilfully omits an Exception I make in the very next Line, thus: <hi>But there is one Caſe to be excepted, viz. when the Child preſents the Buttocks, and is far advanc'd in that Poſture,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0218202800:43"/>even beyond the</hi> Labia; <hi>it is then to be extracted as it lies: which I ſhould chuſe to perform by paſſing a Finger or two of one Hand, or if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of both Hands to the Groin, and thus bring the Child away, rather than attempt the</hi> FEET: This however can be done only when the Child is ſmall, or the Woman large; otherwiſe the Woman is to be laid on her <hi>Back,</hi> with her Hips <hi>rais'd,</hi> and her Shoulders <hi>low,</hi> and then the Child to be return'd, ſo as the Feet may be commanded.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Page, after having repeated what I ſaid, in Caſe of a Child that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with its Face lying towards the <hi>Os Pubis, Pag.</hi> 174. of my ſecond Edit. <q>"That I was unwilling to have recourſe to Art." He proceeds, "Is it not the Art of Midwifery, which the Midwomen have been taught, the only thing which diſtinguiſhes them from other Women? Are not they oblig'd to make uſe of their Art at every Labour they are call'd to? Why then does he ſo often make uſe of the Words <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Artiſts,</hi> and only apply them to himſelf and ſome other <hi>Men?</hi> Won't any one, who reads Madam <hi>Du Tertre</hi>'s little Book, be convinc'd, that ſhe has ſhewn more Art, and better Diction, than either Dr. <hi>Maubray,</hi> or — Does her being a Woman make it improper to ſay, ſhe had Recourſe to <hi>Art,</hi> or that ſhe was an <hi>Artiſt?"</hi>

            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0218202800:44"/>
            <p>I ſhall only obſerve here, that all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Aſſiſtance was before given; and as all Artiſts well know, the Expulſion now lay wholly upon <hi>Nature,</hi> except the taking hold of the <hi>Head,</hi> which I was unwilling to come to, if Nature would have finiſh'd her Work herſelf. But what harm there is in making uſe of the Terms <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Artiſts,</hi> I profeſs myſelf utterly uncapable to comprehend. As to his Query, why I keep the <hi>Fillet</hi> a Secret, after I have own'd it to be neither ſo ſpeedy nor ſo ſecure a Method as the <hi>Forceps? Pag.</hi> 59. I ſhall only anſwer, That I was fairly and honeſtly reſolv'd to own as much, and that I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done it in the Body of my Treatiſe.

            <p>But in relation to his charging me with the Cut of the <hi>Forceps</hi> being but an indifferent one, <hi>Pag.</hi> 60.

            <p>Again, as to his aſſerting that I endeavour to fob him off with ſaying, that all other People's Fillets are for the <hi>Foot,</hi> and mine only for the <hi>Head,</hi> I heartily diſown it. I never yet ſaid that all other People's were for the <hi>Foot,</hi> &amp;c. but only <hi>that I did not believe the manner of paſſing it over the Head to he ſo univerſally known and practiſed.</hi> Which I ſtill have as

            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 62. After repeating two Inſtances wherein Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> and myſelf have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of <hi>Mal-Practice,</hi> he ſubjoins, <q>"Could a <hi>Turk</hi> believe there were any wholſome Laws in a Country where ſuch Barbarities were not ſeverely puniſhed?"</q> To which I ſhall only reply, as I have once before obſerv'd, how can the guilty be puniſh'd for them, or how can their Faults ever come to the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the Publick, if thoſe who are Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of them, and candidly relate them, muſt have a Noiſe and Clamour rais'd againſt them, for ſo doing, and be repreſented as a Set of <hi>partial deſigning</hi> Men, <hi>hauling</hi> in the Women by the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Shoulders,</hi> and accuſing them whether <hi>guilty</hi> or <hi>not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Inſtance of <hi>Mal-Practice</hi> there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, I have obſerv'd, that a Phyſician was ſent for, who had lately taken upon him to practiſe Midwifery, <hi>but was ſo little acquainted with the Art, that he neglected the only thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in that Caſe,</hi> viz. a ſpeedy Delivery by turning the Child; which Words, mark'd here in <hi>Italick,</hi> he reprints in <hi>capital</hi> Letters, as pointing out, I preſume, my indecent Uſage of a Gentleman or the Faculty.

            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 63. Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> makes a very ungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman like Reflection on many great and worthy Gentlemen of the Faculty of Phyſick, and aſks where theſe Doctors could be admitted to their Degrees? Muſt it not, ſays he, have been in ſome <hi>Popiſh</hi> Country, where Orthodoxy is reckoned a better Recommendation than the Knowledge of Diſeaſes? Where viſiting <hi>Chapels</hi> three or four times a Day is thought more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the making a good <hi>Phyſician,</hi> than frequenting the <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> as often? Among the reſt he here ungenerouſly reflects on <hi>one,</hi> who when he wrote this had the Honour to be related to (I mean his own Brother, lately dead at St. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi>) who, I have been told, took his Degree in <hi>France.</hi> But what has the Religion of a Country to do with <hi>Art</hi> and Science?

            <p>I ſhall dwell no longer on this ungenerous Subject, than whilſt I put the following <hi>Queries</hi> to him;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Whether his witty Reflections on Degrees taken in a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Country, are not a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous

               <item>2.

               </item>
               <item>3. Whether viſiting <hi>Churches</hi> is incompatible with viſiting <hi>Hoſpitals?</hi> Are well tim'd Acts of <hi>Devotion</hi> lawful Objections againſt the Qualifications of a <hi>Phyſician?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. Where did he know Degrees confer'd on the Account of <hi>Orthodoxy,</hi> preferable to other Qualifications?</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 64. He aſks if we don't want a proper School for <hi>Midmen</hi> as well as for <hi>Midwomen?</hi> By which at leaſt he intimates that <hi>Midwomen</hi> do; and now the <hi>Plot</hi> begins to <hi>open.</hi> But if <hi>Men</hi> want a proper School, as well as <hi>Women,</hi> how comes it that Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> won't conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to inſtruct them too? Why does he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Propoſals for <hi>Midwomen only. Pag.</hi> 75? Thereby excluding the poor unhappy <hi>Men</hi> from the Benefit of his Aſſiſtance. Surely the Reader will not be ſo unmannerly as to ſuppoſe, what he does in relation to the Phyſician-Midwives not conſulting together, <hi>Pag.</hi> 52.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0218202800:48"/>and think that it is <hi>the Fear of his diſcovering the Inſignificancy of his pretended Lectures, or his own real Ignorance?</hi> Utrum horum.</p>
            <p>Upon my relating that a Woman had been twice or thrice deliver'd by a Man, of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that always preſented with the Head, which the Operator took a fatal Freedom with, <hi>viz.</hi> uſing the <hi>Hook,</hi> he aſks, <q>"How I could tell, who was not preſent, but that all theſe Children were <hi>dead?"</hi>
               </q> So that in one Place he blames me for <hi>not</hi> finding fault with People where they deſerve it, <hi>Pag.</hi> 58. and now he condemns me becauſe I <hi>do,</hi> and endeavours to excuſe the Perſon in a Fault, tho' he was <hi>not preſent</hi> himſelf, and conſequently can know nothing of the Matter. Is this being conſiſtent with himſelf, as he aſks me, <hi>Pag.</hi> 5? So that to uſe his own Words, <hi>Does he expect to fob the Reader off ſo</hi> (Page 60.) <hi>and muſt not he think him very weak and illiterate if he believ'd him?</hi> A little farther he aſks, <q>"If a Man ought not to be very ſure, before he accuſes another after this Manner?"</q> To apply which to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ought not he to have been ſure of the Truth of what Dr. <hi>Chamberlen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Giffard,</hi> and myſelf had aſſerted, before he had accus'd us of condemning the Women, <hi>guilty</hi> or <hi>not?</hi> Who does he expect ſhould inform him? Will the Women be ingenuous and honeſt enough to confeſs their own <hi>Mal-Practice?</hi> And how can he tell, who was <hi>not preſent,</hi> whether we have accus'd them <hi>unjuſtly</hi> or <hi>not?</hi> As for his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0218202800:49"/>thinking me to blame for not ſaying, whether this fatal Freedom-taker was a <hi>Doctor</hi> or an <hi>Ayothecary Midman;</hi> probably I may bethought much more culpable, when I tell him that it was a SURGEON <hi>Midman;</hi> but as to the Truth of this Relation, I have all the Reaſon in the World to believe the Children were <hi>living,</hi> if Credit may be given to no leſs than <hi>three</hi> Matrons who were preſent at the ſeveral La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and all aſſerted the Fact. This indeed was that Perſon's conſtant practice to Children in that Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to fetch them with the <hi>Hook,</hi> whether <hi>living</hi> or <hi>dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſame Page he excuſes me in a great meaſure, tho' perhaps not intentionally, for having ſlipp'd the Mention of a Child's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing with the <hi>Buttocks</hi> in my firſt Edition, by obſerving that Dr. <hi>Nicholls</hi> has omitted the it in the following remarkable Paſſage, <hi>In omni malo ſitu, ut &amp; in rebus deſperatis, pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus extrahetur Foetus.</hi> Compend.

Now if Dr. <hi>Nicholls,</hi> whom he very juſtly ſtiles <hi>excellent,</hi> has forgot to animadvert upon this Particular, ſurely I, who am ſo much his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, may be excus'd the ſame.</p>
            <p>Having thus, as he thinks, triumph'd over Dr. <hi>Chamberlen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Giffard,</hi> and myſelf, he proceeds to make what he calls <hi>Deductions</hi> from the Premiſes; and after expatiating upon the Havock that is oftentimes made among his Majeſty's Subjects, by the Ignorance of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0218202800:50"/>he aſks, if calling of Names, ſuch as rude, rough, negligent, ignorant, fooliſh, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we have ſo liberally beſtow'd upon them, will make them more prudent or judicious, or enable them in any degree to give better Aſſiſtance themſelves, and then replies in the Negative. Where Midwives are really rude, rough, negligent, obſtinate, ignorant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought they not to be properly reprov'd and reprimanded for it? How will they otherwiſe know their Faults? Surely this open Treatment of them is a very improper Method of getting them all at our BECK, as he craftily inſinuates; and I heartily agree with him, <hi>Page</hi> 66. That nothing can better deſerve the Attention even of the <hi>Legiſlature</hi> itſelf. But how is the <hi>Legiſlature</hi> to be inform'd of the true State of their Practice, if we are not to have the honeſt Liberty of profeſſing and aſſerting the Truth? Will the <hi>Midwomen,</hi> as he ſtiles them, come and accuſe themſelves, or is the <hi>Legiſlature</hi> to provide a Remedy for an Evil, of which they have no Knowledge or Information? The Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of the regularly inſtructed, experienc'd, and knowing Profeſſors of this Art is likely to be much ſet by in the Eye of the <hi>Legiſlature,</hi> if Mr. <hi>Douglaſs's</hi> Opinion of them is to be of any Weight, who has unjuſtly and maliciouſly repreſented them as a Set of <hi>deſigning, puzzling, crafty, covetous, hard-hearted, inſolent, ignorant Noſtrum-mongers.</hi> Is this remedying die Evil he ſo loudly complains of, to deter our Wives and Daughters from regular Aſſiſtance, by his

He deſires to know, <q>"If theſe Gentlemen Complainants have propos'd any other Method, to prevent, for the future, this calamitous, this diſmal, this inhuman Practice, except to ſend for one of them, upon every little trifling Difficulty?" Then he proceeds, "Is not this making meer Nurſes of the <hi>Midwomen,</hi> and — (<hi>Fools</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he means) "of their Patients? Is it not telling them plainly, that they neither do, nor ſhall ever know any more of the Matter by any Information they will give them, than (what they knew before) juſt to receive a Child which drops into their Hands?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, he accuſes us of making meer <hi>Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calls of them, to hunt about in Search of our

Have not theſe Gentlemen Complainants, as he calls them, propos'd the beſt Methods to prevent this inhuman Practice? Do not they inſtruct them faithfully in their Writings, and endeavour to make <hi>Midwives</hi> inſtead of <hi>Nurſes</hi> of them? Do they deſire the Midwives to ſend for them upon every <hi>little trifling</hi> Difficulty? And are they not Caſes of <hi>real Difficulty</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> they deſire to be call'd in upon? Does not he allow himſelf (<hi>Pag.</hi> 70.) that in many Caſes <hi>Inſtruments</hi> are abſolutely neceſſary, that they ought to ſend directly for a <hi>Surgeon,</hi> inſtead of fatiguing the Mother, and endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both her and her Child, by needleſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays and fruitleſs Attempts. Are we to be blam'd then for informing them, in what Circumſtances to ſend for us? Is it not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Duty to do it? Would he have Women Midwives only concern'd in Caſes of Extremity? Is inſtructing them in the moſt approv'd Methods of Practice, and the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of turning Children with the greateſt Safety, the ſame thing as telling them, <hi>That they ſhall never know any more of the Matter, than they did before?</hi> And is honeſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to ſend for ſuperior Aſſiſtance, in order to ſave a Fellow Creature from an untimely Death, making them like <hi>Jackcalls to hunt about for our Prey, and then ſend for us to devour it?</hi> Or rather muſt not he be beſides himſelf, or at leaſt think his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0218202800:53"/>Readers ſo, to be gull'd by ſuch notorious Falſhoods?</p>
            <p>But <hi>Page</hi> 70. <hi>Surgeons</hi> are directly to be ſent for; why not ſuch Phyſicians as practiſe this Art? Have not they as much Knowledge, Experience, Charity, and Integrity as the <hi>Surgeons?</hi> Are they not as capable of attaining to Perfection in <hi>Manual</hi> Operations, and of uſing proper Inſtruments with as much Judgment and Dexterity as the <hi>Surgeons?</hi> Why then muſt not they be concern'd too? But as Dr. <hi>Baynard</hi> ſays upon another Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Oh! Self, Self, what a ſelfiſh Thing art thou</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Hiſt. of cold Bathing, <hi>Ed.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 268.</note>!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 68. He ſays that the Unſkilfulneſs of Midwives, is owing to their want of a <hi>Proper Education,</hi> and not to their want of <hi>Capacity,</hi> and aſſerts, that it is more their <hi>Misfortune</hi> than their <hi>Fault.</hi> I think, in many reſpects, the contrary will hold good. For can it poſſibly be more their <hi>Misfortune</hi> than their <hi>Fault,</hi> that they have not got ſuch Inſtruction as is in their Power, from <hi>Books</hi> that have been written for this Purpoſe? How many are there to be met with, that never give themſelves the Trouble of peruſing them for their Information? Is not this manifeſtly more their <hi>Fault</hi> than <hi>Misfortune,</hi> and owing rather to their Indolence, and good Opinion of their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0218202800:54"/>own Sufficiency, than a want of means for their Inſtruction?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> thinks (<hi>Page</hi> 68.) this fatal Diſtemper may be cur'd, and all its bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences for the future avoided, if it was put in the Power of the <hi>Midwomen</hi> to qualify themſelves thoroughly, and at a moderate Expence, in all the Parts of their moſt neceſſary Office, before they are permitted to practiſe. In order to attain this moſt deſirable End, Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> propoſes, Firſt, the erecting an <hi>Hoſpital</hi> in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> (at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Expence, by <hi>Donation</hi> or <hi>Subſcriptions,</hi> as ſeveral <hi>Alms-houſes, Infirmaries, Hoſpitals,</hi> &amp;c. of far leſs Conſequence to the Common-weal, have been, and are daily carried on) for the Reception of about two or three hundred poor Women who are big with Child. Secondly, That a proper Number of <hi>Midwomen</hi> be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to attend them. Thirdly, That two SURGEONS <hi>Midmen</hi> be appointed to aſſiſt theſe <hi>Midwome,</hi> in all extraordinary Caſes, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the Structure of the Parts concern'd, explaining the Art of touching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in ſet Lectures, at leaſt three Times a Week, to all the <hi>Midwomen</hi> and their Apprentices who pleaſe to attend. Fourthly, That every young Woman, who deſigns to practiſe Midwifery, be oblig'd to attend theſe Courſes, during her Apprenticeſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then go and practiſe, for a ſet Time, under thoſe expert Women in that <hi>Hoſpital;</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards let them be examin'd, as to the Skill and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0218202800:55"/>Knowledge they have acquir'd in their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by two <hi>Surgeons,</hi> and ſix or ſeven other Perſons, appointed by his Majeſty (becauſe he does not think it reaſonable that ſo many People's Bread ſhould depend on the Humour and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price of any two Men only) and if approv'd, to receive from them a Certificate of their Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to practiſe in <hi>London,</hi> or any where elſe. Fifthly, That until fit <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> can be built and endow'd, a <hi>Midman</hi> be appointed in every City, or Country-town in <hi>England,</hi> to read the foreſaid Lectures to all the <hi>Midwomen</hi> in the County, and demonſtrate to them the Truth of their Doctrines on the Poor of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, of which there are plenty every where.</p>
            <p>I ſhall forbear making any Remarks upon this <hi>Scheme,</hi> leſt Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> ſhould put a bad Conſtruction on it; and ſhall only obſerve, that I ſhall be as glad to ſee a proper <hi>Hoſpital</hi> erected, or any other Meaſures concerted for the Improvement of <hi>Midwifery,</hi> as himſelf, and ſhall be as ready to contribute any thing in my Power towards the Inſtruction of Midwives. 'Twas this Reaſon alone that induc'd me to write my <hi>Eſſay on the Improvement of Midwifery,</hi> wherein I have candidly inform'd them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt of my Power. And can Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> be thought to have the real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of this Profeſſion at his Heart, when he fells foul upon Dr. <hi>Chamberlen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Giffard,</hi> and myſelf, for endeavouring to improve it, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0218202800:56"/>becauſe we reprimand the guilty and ignorant, and deſire them to ſend for ſuperior Advice in Caſes of Extremity, and not ſacrifice the Life of the Mother, or Child, and oftentimes both to their own Sufficiency? Does not he allow the Midwives himſelf to be oftentimes very ignorant (<hi>Pag.</hi> 68.)? And would not he have them inſtructed as before obſerv'd (<hi>Pag.</hi> 70.) in the Knowledge of thoſe Caſes where Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are abſolutely neceſſary, that they may ſend directly for a SURGEON, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now if there is many times a Neceſſity for calling in better Aſſiſtance, of which no Man in his Senſes can doubt, why muſt we be ſo much blam'd for honeſtly enforcing the ſame Advice? Are we for this to be ſtigmatiz'd as People who <hi>won't</hi> inſtruct them, and repreſented as a Set of <hi>crafty deſigning</hi> Men, who had rather <hi>puzzle</hi> and <hi>confound,</hi> than <hi>illuſtrate</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> the Art we profeſs? Is it not a little ſurpriſing that Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> ſhould expect the Town to have any Opinion of his Probity, or take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his <hi>Scheme</hi> or himſelf, who can be guilty of uſing others in ſuch an unjuſt and ſcurrilous Manner. Tho', as I obſerv'd before, I ſhould be glad to ſee any <hi>Scheme</hi> put in Execution for the real Good and Improvement of <hi>Midwifery,</hi> yet I cannot be ſo ſanguine, in relation to Mr. <hi>Douglaſs's</hi> Propoſal, as he himſelf ſeems to be, <hi>viz. That in very few Years there would hardly be an ignorant Midwoman in</hi> England, Pag. 74.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0218202800:57"/>
            <p>The Profeſſion might certainly receive great Advantage; but to extirpate Ignorance, to that Degree, is a very hard Taſk indeed. When Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> has perform'd this wonderful Feat, I would have him undertake to find out the <hi>Longitude,</hi> and <hi>ſquare</hi> the <hi>Circle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> having ſome Reaſon to doubt, whether the <hi>Publick</hi> would take any notice of this <hi>Scheme</hi> or not, has propos'd another Expedient in the Interim, and that is, <hi>to give a Courſe of Midwifery to</hi> Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women <hi>only</hi> (for the <hi>Men</hi> it ſeems are to be depriv'd of this vaſt Advantage) wherein he promiſes <hi>that the principal Operations of that Art ſhall be briefly explained</hi> (Pag. ult.) And for their greater Encouragement aſſures them, that he is no leſs than the <hi>Goddeſs</hi> of Midwifery, and the only one that is able to inſtruct them.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Dea ſum Auxiliaris, opemque</l>
               <l>Exorata-fero.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Here Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> has openly acknowledged himſelf to be but an <hi>Old-woman;</hi> which is the firſt modeſt Conceſſion I have met with throughout his Book. How far that threatening <hi>Parentheſis</hi> in <hi>Pag.</hi> 68. viz. <hi>That they, who did not readily embrace the Opportunity, would not only be deſervedly blam'd, but ought to be</hi> puniſh'd <hi>by the Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> may influence. Women to come to thoſe Lectures, I muſt leave.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0218202800:58"/>
            <p>Thoſe, who pretend to inſtruct others in any Art, ought, to he Well vers'd in it themſelves; and as Midwifery is a <hi>Manual</hi> Operation, ſo it cannot well be acquir'd but by a due Courſe of Practice. Whether Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> has been much converſant in this Profeſſion, I will not take upon me to determine; tho', I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I never heard any Pretenſions he had to <hi>Midwifery</hi> before he advertis'd the printing of his Book. Indeed he tells us in <hi>Pag.</hi> 58. <hi>That he knew the</hi> Placenta <hi>once left behind,</hi> which does not amount to any Proof of his practiſing himſelf, for he might know that by <hi>Relation,</hi> without ever having really exercis'd this Art. But in <hi>Pag.</hi> 65. he goes farther, and informs us, that he has found the <hi>Sciſſura rimae, ab Vulva ad Anum</hi> by REPEATED EXPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIENCE, not to be at all dangerous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he might have experienc'd as a <hi>Surgeon,</hi> and not profeſſedly as a <hi>Man-Midwife,</hi> it being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a <hi>Surgeon's</hi> Buſineſs, and for which Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> might frequently have been conſulted. There is no other Paſſage to be met with in his whole Book, wherein he gives us the leaſt Hint of his having practis'd himſelf. From whence I think We may fairly conclude, that Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> has bat very lately taken up this Profeſſion; otherwiſe ſurely he would not have omitted to have ſaid ſomething of his <hi>long Practice</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> in order to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak the more favourable Opinion of himſelf among the good Women. Before Mr: <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0218202800:59"/>had made any Propoſals for <hi>Lectures</hi> to the Town, he ought at leaſt to have clear'd up this Doubt, <hi>Whether or no be ever deliver'd a Woman in his Life.</hi> If not, the Reader may judge how fit he is to take upon him the Inſtruction of others. He doubts not, <hi>P.</hi> 70. but the <hi>Midmen</hi> will object and ſay, <hi>That the</hi> Midwomen <hi>want both Capacity and Strength (inſtruct them as you pleaſe) to perform what he propoſes.</hi> To which he immediately replies, <q>"That this is only an artful and groundleſs Inſinuation, and affirms, <hi>ore rotundo, plenis buccis</hi> (as he chuſes to expreſs himſelf) that it is not want of Capacity, Docility, Strength, or Activity, but meerly want of fit and full Inſtructions in all the Parts of their Office, which diſables them to perform it in all Caſes (excepting where Inſtruments are neceſſary) with as much Eaſe, Safety, and Expedition, as the moſt dextrous <hi>Midman, &amp;c."</hi>
               </q> Muſt not this Gentleman be in great Want of Matter to ſhew his Abilities upon, to haul in the <hi>Midmen</hi> making an Objection they probably never ſo much as thought of? Before he had proceeded to this, he ought firſt to have told us, <hi>ore rotundo, plenis buccis,</hi> as he affects to write, who ever doubted of the Womens want of Docility, Strength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor do I ſee what this Obſervation was brought in upon, unleſs it was for the Sake of this paultry Scrap of <hi>Latin,</hi> that the Women might take him for a great <hi>Scholliard,</hi> and admire his profound Knowledge in that learned Language,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0218202800:60"/>like <hi>Scrub</hi> in the Play, who affirms, <q>"That tho' he does not underſtand <hi>Latin,</hi> yet he thinks there's ſomething very pretty in the Sound of it."</q> As to their Want of fit Inſtructions in their Profeſſion, I have before obſerv'd, that they have more Opportunities of Information from <hi>Books</hi> that have from Time to Time been printed for the Improvement of the Art of Midwifery, than many of them thro' Indolence and Self-ſufficiency ever made uſe of; as is very plain from their running counter in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Rules there laid down. And I am much deceiv'd, if they may not meet with as much or more Information, from <hi>Books,</hi> for the Value of three or four <hi>Shillings,</hi> as they will from <hi>Lectures</hi> of ſo many <hi>Guineas.</hi> Beſides, the great Probability of what they hear in <hi>Lectures</hi> ſlipping out of their Memory, whilſt a <hi>Book</hi> is always at Hand, and ready to give them conſtant and repeated Inſtruction, if they will but be at the Trouble of conſulting it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 73.</hi> He aſks, if all Ages have not produc'd Women, who have made a Figure in the moſt ſublime Parts of Learning, and in all Manner of curious and uſeful Arts? (But what Neceſſity for this Query? Who ever doubted it?) and then ſubjoins, and alſo illiterate, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed <hi>Prieſts, Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>Phyſicians?</hi> But what have the <hi>Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> done to diſoblige Mr. <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> that they muſt be haul'd in too, by the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Shoulders,</hi> in a Book of <hi>Midwifery?</hi> But all it ſeems muſt feel his <hi>critical Laſh;</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0218202800:61"/>
            <p>He hints, <hi>Pag.</hi> 73. That at the Time of Delivery it is leaſt proper for Men to come near the Women; forgetting that but a few Pages before (<hi>Pag.</hi> 67.) he blames the Women as obſtinate and unſeaſonably modeſt, for not being willing to admit a <hi>Midman.</hi> But great <hi>Wits,</hi> they ſay, have ſhort Memories.</p>
            <p>But to draw towards a Concluſion; what is all that Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> has ſaid, in relation to myſelf? What has he detected in me that is <hi>wrong?</hi> Or what has he advanc'd from the Writings of his <hi>Old-Woman</hi> which I have not?</p>
            <p>As to informing Midwives, and directing them when to call in ſuperior Aſſiſtance, what have I left unſaid? Or what Direction can be farther given them? Some of the chief of the Profeſſion, of my own Sex, have told me I have been too <hi>open;</hi> ſo that I'm found fault with on both Sides. But this gives me no Uneaſineſs. I have a Satisfaction in doing what I judg'd to be my <hi>Duty,</hi> and acting the Part of an honeſt Man which my Enemies can never be able to rob me of. My Way is to walk in the Path which Providence has put me in, as inoffenſively as poſſibly I can; ever to give the Wall to my <hi>Superiors,</hi> and never to joſtle my Inferiors into the Kennel, or to affront any Perſon. But if a BULLY draws upon me, I never fly, but defend myſelf, with proper Force.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0218202800:62"/>
            <p>I never ſaid or did any thing to deſerve this mighty Man's Diſpleaſure; and yet ſpurr'd on by an envious, jealous Fury he has attack'd me: But alas, his Arm is too weak, and his <hi>Thruſts</hi> are eaſily <hi>parried;</hi> not to mention that by too much Heat he has over LUNGED.</p>
            <p>Having now laid the whole of Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi>'s Objections before the <hi>Reader,</hi> I will not ſuppoſe that his main. Drift, after all his FUSS and SPLUTTER about the Reformation of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery, was purely to ſet himſelf up, as the only Dictator in this Profeſſion, and to inform the good Women that he was better able to give them <hi>Lectures</hi> than any Body elſe. I ſhall paſs over the artful Methods he has made uſe of to inſinuate himſelf into publick Favour, by running down and diſcommending every body elſe. It ſeems they are all a Set of <hi>puzzling, deſigning</hi> Men, rather <hi>confounding</hi> and <hi>darkening,</hi> than <hi>illuminating</hi> their Profeſſion. But Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> has no Deſign; his <hi>Candour, Modeſty,</hi> and good <hi>Uſage</hi> of all he ſpeaks of, will, not ſo much as admit of any ſuch Suſpicion. To be ſure he had no View of throwing a Cloud of Infamy and Ignorance over his <hi>Neighbour's</hi> Character, that his own might appear to the better Advantage. The <hi>Tenderneſs,</hi> he ſhews for other People's Reputation, cannot fail of endearing him to the Town, and making every body as <hi>tender</hi> of his. I will not ſo much as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0218202800:63"/>mention what perhaps ſome People may ſay, that the Motto in the Front of his Book ought to be inverted, and read, <hi>non aliis, ſed ſibi.</hi> But the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Impartiality</hi> of this Author are of all his good Qualities the moſt extraordinary, nor can the Reader well paſs over the following remarkable Inſtances of them. There is for Example, <hi>plain</hi> Dr. <hi>Hody,</hi> and the <hi>ingenious</hi> and <hi>experienc'd</hi> Mr. <hi>Will. Giffard, Surgeon,</hi> Pag, 52. the <hi>diſingenious</hi> (Pag. 53.) <hi>ſtupid</hi> (Pag. 54.) and <hi>abſurd</hi> (Pag. 55.) Dr. <hi>Maubray,</hi> and the <hi>juſt, tart, reverend,</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> Dr. MITCHELL <hi>Utriuſque Medicinae Doctor</hi> (Pag. 55.) The <hi>puzzling, confounding, artful, inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, darkening</hi> (P.ag 3.) <hi>perverting, intereſted, coaxing, threatening</hi> (Pag. 5.) <hi>Cobweb-ſpinning, emuſing</hi> (Pag. 9.) <hi>magiſterial, dictatorial</hi> (P. 13.) <hi>ſulſom, nauſeous</hi> (Pag. 14.) <hi>ſneering, inſolent</hi> (Pag. 21.) <hi>imperious</hi> (Pag. 22.) NOSTRUM-MONGER (Pag. 4, 12, and 24.) Dr. <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlen,</hi> and that accurate <hi>Anatomiſt,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate Accoucher</hi> (his own Brother) Dr. <hi>James Douglaſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' to be ſerious on this Head, I cannot think his worthy <hi>Brother</hi> has any Reaſon to thank him for ſuch a fulſom Compliment. The truly learned are always <hi>modeſt,</hi> and a Gentleman, of Dr. <hi>James Douglaſs</hi>'s well known <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Abilities,</hi> can never ſtand in need of a ſuch a paultry PUFF as this.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> has gone long with this wondrous Birth; the firſt Account we had
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0218202800:64"/>of this Gentleman's <hi>Pregnancy,</hi> was ſeveral Months before he was deliver'd, which at Length, on the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1736, we had Notice of. Some think it a <hi>monſtrous,</hi> others an <hi>abortive</hi> Birth; all agree, that it was not come to its <hi>full Perfection.</hi> But be that as it will, the <hi>Mountain</hi> was long in Labour, and at length, like that in the <hi>Fable,</hi> brought forth a MOUSE.</p>
            <p>Before I take my leave, I cannot but obſerve, that this Book is printed for, and ſold only by, the <hi>Author</hi> in <hi>Lad-Lane,</hi> near <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> at the Price of Two Shillings, tho' it contains but 75 Pages, and that in a looſe Print; which is only double the uſual Price of Pamphlets of that Size. Indeed ſuch a Production, as this, dees not happen often; and it is but fitting, that an <hi>extraordinary Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi> ſhould be bought at an <hi>extraordinary Price.</hi> Which brings to my Mind a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Obſervation I remember to have read in the <hi>Grub-ſtreet Journal</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1. 1735, in relation to Mr. <hi>Douglaſ</hi>'s Propoſals for a new Oſteology tack'd to his trifling Remarks, on a Piece upon the ſame Subject, by an ingenious Author (to whom I am well inform'd Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> lay under the higheſt Obligations) <hi>viz.</hi> that he was much diſpleaſed with him for making Twenty <hi>per Cent.</hi> of his Money, becauſe he had enter'd into the ſame Deſign, with a View of getting Five and Twenty himſelf, baiting and worrying him with all
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0218202800:65"/>the Boiſterouſneſs of Pedantry and Ruſticity, at the ſame Time that he expoſes his own Nakedneſs.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have perſuaded myſelf to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in my Remarks on Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi>'s <hi>trifling</hi> and <hi>malicious</hi> Cavils; nor would I have him think, becauſe he came off unanſwer'd in his paultry Attempt to depreciate that valuable Work (the Author not thinking it worth his while to give him an Anſwer) that therefore he is always to eſcape with Impunity.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> ſeems to be in haſte to diſpoſe of the preſent Edition of his Book, probably becauſe he has ſome freſh Obſervations to oblige the Town with in a future Edition of that elaborate Work.</p>
            <p>But leſt he ſhould imagine me ready, to anſwer any farther, ſuch falſe and dirty Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as he may think fit to fling upon me, I here aſſure him, once for all, that I have Affairs of much more Conſequence to mind, nor can I give him a better general Anſwer, than what I am told the aforeſaid Gentleman ſent him; when being aſk'd by an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Mr. <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> if he would not give a Reply, he cooly anſwer'd, <hi>Whenever I have as little Buſineſs, or as much Malice as bimſelf, I will ſet about it.</hi>
