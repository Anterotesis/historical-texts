            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE favourable reception which the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Comedy has met with from a candid and generous Public, calls for my warmeſt acknowledgements; and tho' it may be of little conſequence to them to know the ſource of ſo ſlight an amuſement, I think myſelf bound by truth and gratitude to own, that the firſt idea of this Piece was hinted to me by my ever-reſpected and lamented friend Mr. GARRICK, who mentioned GOLDONI's <hi>Bourru Bienfaiſant,</hi> as a ſketch that, if adapted to our times and manners, might be rendered pleaſing to an Engliſh Audience. Thoſe who have read the French Piece muſt judge how far I have profited by GOLDONI's work; but of this I am certain, that had Mr. GARRICK lived to afford me that friendly aſſiſtance which he has done on former occaſions, my Comedy would have been more worthy of the reception with which it has been honoured. I will, however, hope that, <q>with all its imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on its head,</q> the ſame indulgence which attended its repreſentation, will follow it into the cloſet; and that the Reader will allow me the only merit I preſume to claim, that of meaning well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0387601100:4"/>
I gladly take this opportunity of returning my thanks to my much-eſteemed friend, Mr. SHERIDAN, ſenior, for his kind attention to the getting up my Play, my ill health not permitting me to attend one Rehearſal. But Mr. SHERIDAN's friendſhip, wherever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, is not of modern growth.</p>
            <p>I have more than common acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to make to all the Performers in my Comedy; particularly to Mrs. ABINGTON and Miſs POPE, who both chearfully undertook Parts out of their uſual line of acting, and in which they have both excelled. I ſhould be utterly unable to expreſs my ſentiments of Mr. KING, in the character of SIR WILLIAM WOODLEY, if I were not at liberty ſeriouſly to adopt the very words which he humorouſly, but juſtly, ſpeaks of himſelf, under a perſonated character, in <hi>The Critic:—</hi>
               <q>But it is impoſſible for language to do juſtice to Mr. KING! Indeed, he more than merited thoſe repeated burſts of applauſe which he drew from a moſt bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and judicious Audience.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I flatter myſelf, this little tribute to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed merit will not be deemed tedious or impertinent by the Public, for whoſe opinion I have the ſincereſt reſpect, and to whom I have the honour to be</p>

I have juſt now left Jack Knightly and Will Careleſs calculating, not their nativities, but their deaths.</p>

                  <p>True:—but then they have travelled the modern ſhort and eaſy road to ruin, of granting annuities for this twelvemonth paſt, and are now ſo nearly arrived at the laſt ſtage of their journey, that I think Jack ſaid he had but two months to run; and Will flattered himſelf, that as the ſummer was approaching, he might be able to hold out four. I adviſed their compounding the terms, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together for three months each.</p>

                  <p>What! moping again, Woodley? You'll infect me, if I ſtay.—Where are the Ladies?—In truth, my viſit was to them, for I ſcarce hoped to find you here. Are Lady Mary and your ſiſter viſible? or ſhall I paſs on to your Uncle's apartment, and pay my reſpects to him? I think there is a door of communication to his houſe from this room.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
                  <p>That may be a ſervice of danger, Colonel; for I fear Sir William is not at preſent much delighted either with his vicinity, or affinity, to any of this family, except my ſiſter.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>I am glad to hear you can except my ſweet Louiſa; for, notwithſtanding the bruſqueneſs of his manners, I have ſuch an opinion of the old Knight's good ſenſe and good nature, that I cannot readily acquit thoſe he is offended with, as wholly free from blame.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſubſcribe to your cenſure, as far as it relates to myſelf; but the aſperity of his behaviour to Lady Mary, renders me extremely unhappy; and not even my paſt obligations, or future proſpects,

                  <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
                  <p>That's a dangerous tenet, Colonel, and may be extended 'till downright rudeneſs may be conſidered but as the privilege of family-chat.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>I think you have no cauſe for ſuch an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, in this caſe, as Sir William is quite as ſingular for goodneſs of heart, as for a deficiency in that outward varniſh which too often ſupplies the place of it. But to compound the argument, let us admit there may be faults on both ſides.</p>

No, that's not probable, as he has at leaſt twenty pair more than he knows any thing of— <stage>(puts them in his pocket).</stage> This ſnuff-box, too, is but a bauble, of more curioſity than value: I ſhall accept of it as a keep-ſake— <stage>(pockets it).</stage>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
                  <p>HOW truly do I rejoice to ſee my good friend Mr. Belford! But may I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf that the honour of this viſit was intended for me?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
                  <p>I am ſorry, my dear Sir, that there ſhould be a neceſſity for diſcriminating the perſon to whom my reſpects are paid, in a family I ſo equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regard, and which was once ſo happily united.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
                  <p>If indeed you regard this family, or ever had any friendſhip for me—But I cannot ſpeak.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
                  <p>I am already apprized of your difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and would ſpare you the pain of even hinting at them, were it in my power to redreſs them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
                  <p>Then be aſſured it is; for amidſt all my diſtreſſes, nothing afflicts me half ſo much as Sir William's implacable reſentment againſt Lady Mary and me. If he were but reconciled—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
                  <p>That is, in plain Engliſh, my young friend, if he could be reconciled to your expenſive mode of living, he ought in honour to aſſiſt in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting it. But that, I doubt, will never be brought to paſs, though Sir William is both rich and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
                  <p>To all the world, but me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
                  <p>In this caſe, then, you ſhould ſuſpect your own conduct, rather than his character.—But remonſtrances are uſeleſs, now; and I promiſe to uſe my utmoſt intereſt to bring about a reconciliation.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0387601100:23"/>
But I much fear that we ſhall not be able to get Lady Mary included in the family-compact; for I know no man more reſolute in what he conceives to be right, than Sir William.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
                  <p>My honour, as well as my love, obliges me to vindicate her; and I here pledge them both, that ſhe is free from blame.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
                  <p>I am glad to find you ſtill a lover, Mr. Woodley; but I who am but a friend, in this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can't help thinking, that if Lady Mary had ſpent more of her time in Dorſetſhire, and leſs at Spa, Paris, and other places of diſſipation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance, ſhe would have been more entitled to Sir William's eſteem, and you would have had leſs need of his aſſiſtance.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
                  <p>The fault was mine alone.—Vain of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing ſuch a treaſure—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
                  <p>You childiſhly expoſed it to the gaze of fops and foreigners.—And let me tell you, Mr. Woodley, you are a lucky man, in theſe licentious times, to have preſerved ſuch a gem pure and entire, even at the expence of your other poſſeſſions. But, prithee, why don't you now retreat into the country?</p>

I will give her as much more, at preſent, and my whole eſtate, after my death.—No, no,—that won't be acting juſtly—Woodley may have children—They have not offended me, though their father has;—and if they ſhould be half ſo pleaſant as he was when he was a child, I ſhould love them dearly, as I once did him. But I muſt ſtrive to forget all that buſineſs, now.—Here comes Louiſa.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
                  <p>I AM no drinking man myſelf, Belford; but yet I do not approve of this water ſyſtem of yours. It keeps the ſpirits too low—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
                  <p>To ſay or do any thing mad or fooliſh, I grant it may. But if water does not raiſe, it never depreſſes the ſpirits. Can you ſay as much for your generous wine?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, well, I won't diſpute with you, becauſe I hate argument; and as you are an honeſt fellow, I can venture to take my glaſs chearfully in your company, tho' you don't partake of my liquor. But I'd give ſomething, ay, more than I'll mention, that you'd ſhare only one pint of claret with me, now.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
                  <p>I have made no vows, Sir William; and to humour a friend can eaſily diſpenſe with rules of my own making: So here's your fair niece, Louiſa Woodley, in a bumper.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
                  <p>Thank you, thank you, my good friend! She is a moſt excellent girl, and I like to have her toaſted by ſuch a man as you. I wiſh ſhe was well ſettled, with all my heart.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
                  <p>There can be no doubt of her marrying to advantage. She is a fine young woman, with a fine fortune.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
                  <p>And ſo may be ſacrificed to ſome fine young man, that may ſpend her fortune in finery, as her hopeful brother has done, and leave her a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0387601100:39"/>
No, no,—I'll prevent that—I have thought of a match for her—Fill your glaſs, Belford!—a prudent, ſober, ſenſible man.— <stage>(aſide)</stage> I wiſh he'd take the hint.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
                  <p>Rare qualities, indeed, for a young man of faſhion to poſſeſs, in theſe days, Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
                  <p>Who told you that he was a <hi>young man of faſhion?</hi> Why, Sir, there have been no <hi>men</hi> born, at leaſt, for theſe laſt thirty years—all monkies and macaronies. No Hearts of Oak, now, Belford,—all dwindled, dwindled into aſpens!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
                  <p>Your ſarcaſm is rather too general, my good friend. Courage is the birth-right of an Engliſhman, and while one acre of our ſoil remains, both the Oak and the Laurel will thrive on it.—We muſt not prejudge the riſing generation; and I have not the leaſt doubt but your niece will make a very proper choice.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
                  <p>A choice! I hope ſhe has been better educated, than to have a choice, Sir. I was not conſulted in her brother's match, and you ſee the conſequence.—I ſhall diſpoſe of Louiſa in my own way.—I have a huſband now in my eye for her, Belford.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
                  <p>Whoever obtains Miſs Woodley, will, I dare ſay, be a very happy man.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
                  <p>Stick to that, my dear Belford.—Yes, yes, whoever marries Louiſa will be a very happy man, and I am extremely glad you think ſo.— <stage>(aſide)</stage> I wiſh he'd come to the point.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
                  <p>You know, Sir William, that I have long been acquainted with Miſs Woodley's merit.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
                  <p>You charm me, my dear Belford. I am glad you know her worth, and you will therefore cheriſh it.—She is mild and timid—but you'll be kind and gentle to her, even for my ſake, my good old friend.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
                  <p>I marry her, Sir William!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, Sir—Did you not, this moment, allow that who ever married her, would be a very happy man? And I ſuppoſe, you can have no poſſible objection to being a very happy man, Mr. Belford?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, Sir, the ſtrongeſt in the world, if my happineſs is to be purchaſed at the expence of another's miſery.—But I am wrong for being ſerious, when I am certain you do but jeſt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
                  <p>In the firſt place, Sir, I never ſaid any thing in jeſt, ſince I was born.—And, ſecondly, Sir, I never was more in earneſt, in the whole courſe of my life. I therefore requeſt from you a ſerious anſwer.—Jeſt, indeed! No, truly, Counſellor, I am no joker.</p>

                  <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, then, Sir, I ſhould think myſelf highly honoured—</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>

I own, I ſuſpected, from the firſt, that it was rather too good news to be true:—but don't make yourſelf unhappy, Miſs Woodley; for I would rather live and die a batchelor, than marry the fineſt woman in England, as is now the caſe <stage>(bowing),</stage> who was not equally ready <hi>to have and to hold.</hi>

                  <p>Every word, I aſſure you. But we ſhall ſoon make it up, for ours are but lovers' quarrels.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Bromley.</speaker>
                  <p>Lovers! talk of love after four years marriage! Believe me, Lady Mary, 'tis all a farce.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Mary.</speaker>
                  <p>No, my dear Mrs. Bromley, I cannot give you credit againſt the feelings of my own heart. I love Mr. Woodley, and I am firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that he has a ſincere affection for me, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the little peeviſhneſs of his behaviour to-day, which I own makes me apprehend that ſomething muſt have ruffled him extremely.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Bromley.</speaker>
                  <p>How did you like his peremptory reſolve, of paſſing the whole ſummer in Dorſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire?</p>

                  <speaker>L. Mary.</speaker>
                  <p>Not at all, I confeſs; 'tis frightful to think of it—though there is a tolerable neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood—</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Bromley.</speaker>
                  <p>Of empty houſes.—No creature ſtays at their family ſeats, now-a-days, unleſs it be ſome antiquated Dowager, who, like an old Gothic corner cupboard, remains fixed to the freehold.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Mary.</speaker>
                  <p>I vow I won't go into the country—'tis quite <hi>mauvais ton—</hi>except you'll come with us; and then we'll fly about to all the bathing-places, and give a maſquerade at one of them.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Bromley.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſhould like to paſs a few weeks ſo, well enough;—and, indeed, my dear, you'll be quite forgotten, if you don't do ſomething in that way. But are you ſure that Mr. Woodley would like it? for I muſt ſay, though I aſk your pardon, Lady Mary, he is dull—abſolutely dull, indeed, my dear.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Mary.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, I own, of late he has been rather gloomy;—but he is vaſtly good-natured, and never before refuſed any requeſt of mine.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Bromley.</speaker>
                  <p>That may be:—but had Mr. Bromley talked to me in the ſame manner—</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Mary.</speaker>
                  <p>You would have loved him juſt as well as you do now.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Bromley.</speaker>
                  <p>You are admirable at gueſſing, my dear;—for as that ſame romantic notion of love never was the band of our connexion—</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Mary.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſtartle me, Mrs. Bromley. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage without love muſt ſurely be a ſtate of the greateſt unhappineſs.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Bromley.</speaker>
                  <p>No, I don't feel in the leaſt unhappy.—Convenience is the beſt matrimonial cement, and keeps many couples together for years, whoſe love did not out-laſt the honey-moon.—But theſe are myſteries, into which you ſeem not yet initiated.</p>

                  <p>You quite amaze me, Sir, by ſuſpicions which, I will be bold to ſay, are unworthy both of Sir William Woodley and me. I am no gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, Sir, nor have I diſſipated the noble inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance derived from my anceſtors.</p>

                  <p>If I were ſo unfortunately weak, as you for a moment ſeemed to imagine, the reſpect I bear you, would have prevented my applying to you upon ſuch an occaſion, as your good opinion, Sir, is of the greateſt conſequence to my happineſs.</p>

                  <p>There you are wrong, Colonel;—you had much better apply to me, than to any one elſe.—I am no cent. per cent. man—I never received a ſhilling intereſt from any friend in my life; and I have my doubts whether I ſhould even take it from the Funds, now that the Nation is ſo poor.—But come, Colonel, if you don't want money, in what other way can I poſſibly ſerve you?

                  <p>Money, child! I have never touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above a thouſand pounds of their caſh yet. This piece of paper is all I have got for ſpending my time with a dull fool, and endeavouring to perſuade him that he was a Solomon, and his ſilly wife the Queen of Sheba. But I muſt be paid for my attendance and trouble, and in a few minutes I ſhall convert this manuſcript into the ſum of ſeven thouſand three hundred and fifty-three pounds, with coſts—coſts muſt be added.</p>

                  <p>A fig for your prudence—ay, and for virtue too, againſt example! Example, child, is the ruin of us all. We naturally ſtrive to ape thoſe that are called our Betters, and ſo become worſe than we otherwiſe ſhould be.—But this is no time for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralizing. Do you ſtep in and tell your brother I am coming. I'll juſt wrap my cloak round me and follow you.</p>

                  <p>I'm glad to meet you here, all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for I have buſineſs with every one of you, jointly and ſeverally.—And firſt for you, Colonel, I am very much obliged to you, Sir, and I ſcorn to be obliged to any man, without making him ſome return for his kindneſs. I therefore make you a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I refuſed you, a few hours ago, for the ſake of old Sir Doubtful Deliberation there.—But do you take Louiſa, and for aught I know, you may make her as good a huſband as he would have done.</p>

                  <p>That's right—ſtick to that.—No thanks, but deſerve as much as ever you can.—And as for you, Mr. Belford, though I am confoundedly angry with you, I muſt get you to ſettle this young man's affairs; his debts of <hi>honour,</hi> his <hi>poſt obits,</hi> &amp;c.; though perhaps it may be only affording him an opportunity for <hi>deranging</hi> them again.—That's the modern phraſe, I think, for being over-head-and-ears in debt.</p>
