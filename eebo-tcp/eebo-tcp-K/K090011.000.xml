            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>ABOUT the Year 1769, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the following Tract, being frequently Witneſs to the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0029501000:3"/>attending People that had the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to be burned or ſcalded, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to apply himſelf ſtudiouſly to obſerve the Effects, and to find a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that would quickly reſtore Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and one ſo ſimple, that it might in general be readily adopted in all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. —This Deſideratum was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, after many Experiments about that Time, acquired, and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that have been miſerably ſcorched and ſcalded have been inſtantaneouſly cured by following the Author's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0029501000:4"/>
            <p>THE outer Dreſs of Ladies being of late Years compoſed of Gauze, Muſlin, and other inflammable Articles, which blaze away ſo violently, when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately take Fire, that the moſt dreadful Miſchief has enſued, too ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly for Prevention. The Numbers of the Unfortunate have much increaſed with the Faſhion;—how many have of late been moſt miſerably ſcorched and defaced;—how many have ſuffered a lingering death, under the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciating tortures;—while the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods uſed as Remedies have only
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0029501000:5"/>ſerved to lengthen the Term of their Miſery.</p>
            <p>THE Author preſumes, that the Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Method will entitle it to a favourable Reception with the Public, and that there need no Apology for the Publication.</p>
            <p>IN the Uſe of Oil, and ſeveral other Things that are applied as Remedies for Scalds and Burns, it may be obſerved, that Nature denies their Admiſſion into the Pores of the Skin. That the acid Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0029501000:6"/>Plenty of which is generally upon the Surface of the Skin, together with the continued Action of Nature through the Pores, are Repellers of ſeveral Things that would be Remedies in theſe Caſes.</p>
            <p>THE Author ſurmiſed, that if this acid Perſpiration was to be overcome, or continually waſhed away as it is produced, that Applications might then take Effect; and in Conſequence of thoſe Obſervations, after repeated Experiments, he laid down the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0029501000:7"/>eaſy Rules, which, when practiſed, were never known to fail, but many and ſurpriſing Cures have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and ſo far from giving Pain, that the Pain cauſed by the Burning or Scalding ceaſes immediately on the Application. Whereas ſuch violent Pains are produced by the Application of Spirits, and ſome other Things, that the Remedy is worſe than the Diſeaſe, and the Patient lingers out a moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Life, and dies the moſt excru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating of all Deaths.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0029501000:8"/>
            <p>TAKE Soft Soap (Hard if that is not to be had), diſſolve it in boiling Water, exceeding ſtrong, in as little Water as poſſible; then make it cold immediately, by the Addition of cold Water; be careful to obſerve, that there be full ſix Ounces of Soap in every Gallon of this cold Solution, and Half a Drachm of Sal Tartar:— Then put in the injured Part, and move it gently about, keeping it there Half an Hour: For a recent Matter this is ſufficient; if it be of long Standing it may be continued or repeated as Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion requires.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0029501000:9"/>
            <p>MIND to have Solution in Proportion to the Nature of the Caſe. If a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is ſcalded or ſcorched all over, he or ſhe may ſtand or ſit up to the Chin naked in it, and frequently immerge the Head, or let ſome Perſon continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pour plentifully of the Solution upon the Head.</p>
            <p>IN this Caſe, it will take 50 or 60 Gallons of Water, and from 18 lb. to 22 lb. of Soap, with about two Ounces of Sal Tartar.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0029501000:10"/>
            <p>THIS will be ſtrong enough to take off all Greaſineſs and Dirt from the Body, without rubbing. It will keep the injured Part ſoft and cold, while the Circulation regains its uſual or a new Courſe, and innate Nature repairs the Havoc made by the Fire.</p>
            <p>A FEW Caſes, among many, here follow, by Way of Elucidation:</p>
            <p>A BOY having his Leg ſcalded, by a Pan-full of boiling Water being thrown upon it, after trying various Methods
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0029501000:11"/>for three or four Days to no Purpoſe, was cured by keeping it in the Solution (prepared as abovementioned) about Half an Hour, ſo that the Pain never returned, and the Leg healed in a very ſhort Time.</p>
            <p>IN like Manner, a Man was cured who burned the Skin off his Hand, and terribly ſcorched the Fleſh, againſt a hot Plate of Iron.</p>
            <p>THE Author having accidentally ſlipped his Arm, almoſt up to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0029501000:12"/>Elbow, into a Copper of Water that was boiling furiouſly; he put it into cold Water, which immediately took off the Pain, which was become exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; while immerſed, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbed and ſenſeleſs, but when took out of the Water, the Pain returned with great Violence.—He therefore kept it in this Situation while the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was making as above.—The Soap being diſſolved and cooled well, he plunged his Hand and Arm in it; the Pain never returned, the Numb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs went off, and the Limb as it were
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0029501000:13"/>revivified; he continued it in the above Solution about 15 Minutes, and never after felt the leaſt Pain or ill Effects from this terrible Scald.</p>
