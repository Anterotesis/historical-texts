            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>OUR Defects and Follies are too often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us; nay, they are ſo far from being known to us, that they paſs for Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Worth. This makes us eaſie in the midſt of them, fond to ſhew them, fond to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in them, and to be eſteemed for them. Then it is that a thouſand unaccountable Conceits, gay Inventions, and extravagant Actions muſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us Pleaſures, and diſplay us to others in the Colours which we our ſelves take a Fancy to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in: And indeed there is ſomething ſo amuſing for the Time in this State of Vanity and ill-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0187500300:188"/>Satisfaction, that even the wiſer World has choſen an exalted Word to deſcribe its Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and called it <hi>the Paradiſe of Fools.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps the latter Part of this Reflection may ſeem a falſe Thought to ſome, and bear another Turn than what I have given; but it is at preſent none of my Buſineſs to look after it, who am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to confeſs that I have been lately amongſt them in a Viſion.</p>
               <p>Methought I was tranſported to a Hill, green, flowery, and of an eaſy Aſcent. Upon the broad Top of it reſided ſquint-eyed <hi>Errour,</hi> and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Opinion</hi> with many Heads; two that dealt in Sorcery, and were famous for bewitching People with the Love of themſelves. To theſe repaired a Multitude from every Side, by two different Paths which lead towards each of them. Some who had the moſt aſſuming Air went directly of themſelves to <hi>Errour,</hi> without expecting a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor; others of a ſofter Nature went firſt to popular <hi>Opinion,</hi> from whence as ſhe influenced and engaged them with their own Praiſes, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them over to his Government.</p>
               <p>When we had aſcended to an open Part of the Summit where <hi>Opinion</hi> abode, we found her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining ſeveral who had arrived before us. Her Voice was pleaſing; ſhe breathed Odours as ſhe ſpoke: She ſeemed to have a Tongue for every one;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0187500300:189"/>every one thought he heard of ſomething that was valuable in himſelf, and expected a Paradiſe which ſhe promiſed as the Reward of his Merit. Thus were we drawn to follow her, till ſhe ſhould bring us where it was to be beſtowed: And it was obſervable, that all the Way we went, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was either praiſing themſelves in their Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, or one another for thoſe Qualifications which they took to be conſpicuous in their own Characters, or diſpraiſing others for wanting theirs, or vying in the Degrees of them.</p>
               <p>At laſt we approached a Bower, at the Entrance of which <hi>Errour</hi> was ſeated. The Trees were thick-woven, and the Place where he ſat artfully contrived to darken him a little. He was diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a whitiſh Robe, which he had put on, that he might appear to us with a nearer Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to <hi>Truth:</hi> And as ſhe has a Light whereby ſhe manifeſts the Beauties of Nature to the Eyes of her Adorers, ſo he had provided himſelf with a magical Wand, that he might do ſomething in Imitation of it, and pleaſe with Deluſions. This he lifted ſolemnly, and muttering to himſelf, bid the Glories which he kept under Enchantment to appear before us. Immediately we caſt our Eyes on that part of the Sky to which he pointed, and obſerved a thin blue Proſpect, which cleared as Mountains in a Summer Morning when the Miſts go off, and the Palace of <hi>Vanity</hi> appeared to Sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0187500300:190"/>The Foundation hardly ſeemed a Foundation, but a Set of curling Clouds, which it ſtood upon by magical Contrivance. The Way by which we aſcended was painted like a Rainbow; and as we went the Breeze that played about us bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Senſes. The Walls were gilded all for Show; the loweſt Set of Pillars were of the ſlight Fine <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order, and the Top of the Building being rounded, bore ſo far the Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a Bubble.</p>
               <p>At the Gate the Travellers neither met with a Porter, nor waited till one ſhould appear; every one thought his Merits a ſufficient Paſsport, and preſſed forward. In the Hall we met with ſeveral Phantoms, that rov'd amongſt us, and rang'd the Company according to their Sentiments. There was decreaſing <hi>Honour,</hi> that had nothing to ſhew in but an old Coat of his Anceſtors Atchievements: There was <hi>Oſtentation,</hi> that made himſelf his own conſtant Subject, and <hi>Gallantry</hi> ſtrutting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Tip-toes. At the upper end of the Hall ſtood a Throne, whoſe Canopy glitter'd with all the Riches that Gayety could contrive to laviſh on it; and between the gilded Arms ſat <hi>Vanity</hi> deck'd in the Peacock's Feathers, and acknowledged for another <hi>Venus</hi> by her Votaries. The Boy who ſtood beſide her for a <hi>Cupid,</hi> and who made the World to bow before her, was called <hi>Self-Conceit.</hi> His Eyes had every now and then a Caſt in wards,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0187500300:191"/>to the Neglect of all Objects about him; and the Arms which he made uſe of for Conqueſt, were borrowed from thoſe againſt whom he had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. The Arrow which he ſhot at the Soldier, was fledg'd from his own Plume of Feathers; the Dart he directed againſt the Man of Wit, was winged from the Quills he writ with; and that which he ſent againſt thoſe who preſumed upon their Riches, was headed with Gold out of their Treaſuries: He made Nets for Stateſmen from their own Contrivances; he took Fire from the Eyes of Ladies, with which he melted their Hearts; and Lightning from the Tongues of the Eloquent, to enflame them with their own Glories. At the Foot of the Throne ſat three falſe Graces. <hi>Flattery</hi> with a Shell of Paint, <hi>Affectation</hi> with a Mirrour to practiſe at, and <hi>Faſhion</hi> ever chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Poſture of her Cloaths. Theſe applied themſelves to ſecure the Conqueſts which <hi>Self-Conceit</hi> had gotten, and had each of them their particular Polities. <hi>Flattery</hi> gave new Colours and Complexions to all Things, <hi>Affectation</hi> new Airs and Appearances, which, as ſhe ſaid, were not vulgar, and <hi>Faſhion</hi> both concealed ſome home Defects, and added ſome foreign external Beauties.</p>
               <p>As I was reflecting upon what I ſaw, I heard a Voice in the Crowd, bemoaning the Condition of Mankind, which is thus managed by the Breath of <hi>Opinion,</hi> deluded by <hi>Errour,</hi> fir'd by <hi>Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0187500300:192"/>and given up to be trained in all the Courſes of <hi>Vanity,</hi> till <hi>Scorn</hi> or <hi>Poverty</hi> come upon us. Theſe Expreſſions were no ſooner handed about, but I immediately ſaw a general Diſorder, till at laſt there was a Parting in one Place, and a grave old Man decent and reſolute, was led forward to be puniſhed for the Words he had uttered. He appeared inclined to have ſpoken in his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but I could not obſerve that any one was willing to hear him. <hi>Vanity</hi> caſt a ſcornful Smile at him; <hi>Self Conceit</hi> was angry; <hi>Flattery,</hi> who knew him for <hi>Plain-dealing,</hi> put on a <hi>Vizard,</hi> and turned away; <hi>Affectation</hi> toſſed her Fan, made Mouths, and called him <hi>Envy</hi> or <hi>Slander;</hi> and <hi>Faſhion</hi> would have it, that at leaſt he muſt be <hi>Ill-Manners.</hi> Thus ſlighted and deſpiſed by all, he was driven out for abuſing People of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Figure; and I heard it firmly reſolved, that he ſhould be uſed no better where-ever they met with him hereafter.</p>
               <p>I had already ſeen the meaning of moſt part of that Warning which he had given, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how the latter Words ſhould be fulfilled, when a mighty Noiſe was heard without, and the Door was blackned by a numerous Train of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies crowding in upon us. <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Broken Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi> were ſeen in the Houſe before they entered. <hi>Trouble, Shame, Infamy, Scorn</hi> and <hi>Poverty</hi> brought up the Rear. <hi>Vanity,</hi> with her <hi>Cupid</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> diſappeared; her Subjects ran into
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0187500300:193"/>Holes and Corners; but many of them were found and carried off (as I was told by one who ſtood near me) either to Priſons or Cellars, Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or little Company, the mean Arts or the viler Crafts, of Life. But theſe, added he with a diſdainful Air, are ſuch who would fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly live here, when their Merits neither matched the Luſtre of the Place, nor their Riches its Expences. We have ſeen ſuch Scenes as theſe before now; the Glory you ſaw will all return when the Hurry is over. I thank'd him for his Information, and believing him ſo incorrigible as that he would ſtay till it was his Turn to be taken, I made off to the Door, and overtook ſome few, who, though they would not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to <hi>Plain-dealing,</hi> were now terrified to good purpoſe by the Example of others: But when they had touched the Threſhold, it was a ſtrange ſhock to them to find that the Deluſion of <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> was gone, and they plainly diſcerned the Building to hang a little up in the Air without any real Foundation. At firſt we ſaw nothing but a deſperate Leap remained for us, and I a thouſand times blamed my unmeaning Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that had brought me into ſo much Danger. But as they began to ſink lower in their own Minds, methought the Palace ſunk along with us, till they were arrived at the due Point of <hi>Eſteem</hi> which they ought to have for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; then the Part of the Building in which they ſtood touched the Earth, and we depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0187500300:194"/>out, it retired from our Eyes. Now, whether they who ſtayed in the Palace were ſenſible of this Deſcent, I cannot tell; it was then my Opinion that they were not. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, my Dream broke up at it, and has given me Occaſion all my Life to reflect upon the fatal Conſequences of following the Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of <hi>Vanity.</hi>

               <p>HOW are we tortured with the Abſence of what we covet to poſſeſs, when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be loſt to us! What Excurſions does the Soul make in Imagination after it! and how does it turn into it ſelf again, more fooliſhly fond and dejected, at the Diſappointment! Our Grief, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of having Recourſe to Reaſon, which might reſtrain it, ſearches to find a further Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. It calls upon Memory to relate the ſeveral Paſſages and Circumſtances of Satisfactions which we formerly enjoyed; the Pleaſures we
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0187500300:196"/>purchaſed by thoſe Riches that are taken from us; or the Power and Splendour of our departed Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; or the Voice, the Words, the Looks, the Temper, and Affections of our Friends that are deceaſed. It needs muſt happen from hence, that the Paſſion ſhould often ſwell to ſuch a Size as to burſt the Heart which contains it, if Time did not make theſe Circumſtances leſs ſtrong and lively, ſo that Reaſon ſhould become a more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Match for the Paſſion, or if another Deſire which becomes more preſent did not overpower them with a livelier Repreſentation. Theſe are Thoughts which I had, when I fell into a kind of Viſion upon this Subject, and may therefore ſtand for a proper Introduction to a Relation of it.</p>
               <p>I found my ſelf upon a naked Shore, with Company whoſe afflicted Countenances witneſſed their Conditions. Before us flowed a Water deep, ſilent, and called the River of <hi>Tears,</hi> which iſſuing from two Fountains on an upper Ground, encompaſſed an Iſland that lay before us. The Boat which plied in it was old and ſhattered, having been ſometimes overſet by the Impatience and Haſte of ſingle Paſſengers to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the other ſide. This immediately was brought to us by <hi>Misfortune</hi> who ſteers it, and we were all preparing to take our Places, when there appeared a Woman of a mild and compoſed Behaviour, who began to deter us from it, by repreſenting the Dangers which would attend our
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0187500300:197"/>Voyage. Hereupon ſome who knew her for <hi>Patience,</hi> and ſome of thoſe too who till then cry'd the loudeſt, were perſuaded by her, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd back. The reſt of us went in, and ſhe (whoſe Good-nature would not ſuffer her to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Perſons in Trouble) deſired Leave to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany us, that ſhe might at leaſt adminiſter ſome ſmall Comfort or Advice while we ſailed. We were no ſooner embarked but the Boat, was puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off, the Sheet was ſpread; and being filled with <hi>Sighs,</hi> which are the Winds of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we made a Paſſage to the farther Bank thro' ſeveral Difficulties of which the moſt of us ſeem'd utterly regardleſs.</p>
               <p>When we landed, we perceived the Iſland to be ſtrangely over-caſt with Fogs, which no Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could pierce, ſo that a kind of gloomy Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſat always brooding over it. This had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it very ſhocking to eaſy Tempers, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſome others, whom <hi>Patience</hi> had by this time gain'd over, left us here, and privily convey'd themſelves round the Verge of the Iſland to find a Ford by which ſhe told them they might eſcape.</p>
               <p>For my part, I ſtill went along with thoſe who were for piercing into the Centre of the Place; and joining our ſelves to others whom we found upon the ſame Journey, we marched ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly as at a Funeral, thro' bordering Hedges
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0187500300:198"/>of Roſemary, and thro' a Grove of Yew-Trees, which love to over-ſhadow Tombs and flouriſh in Church-Yards. Here we heard on every ſide the Wailings and Complaints of ſeveral of the Inhabitants, who had caſt themſelves diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lately at the Feet of Trees; and as we chanc'd to approach any of theſe, we might perceive them wringing their Hands, beating their Breaſts, tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Hair, or after ſome other manner viſibly agitated with Vexation. Our Sorrows were heightned by the Influence of what we heard and ſaw, and one of our Number was wrought up to ſuch a Pitch of Wildneſs, as to talk of hanging himſelf upon a Bough which ſhot temptingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs the Path we travelled in; but he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd from it by the kind Endeavours of our abovementioned Companion.</p>
               <p>We had now gotten into the moſt dusky ſilent Part of the Iſland, and by the redoubled Sounds of Sighs, which made a doleful whiſtling in the Branches, the Thickneſs of Air which occaſioned faintiſh Reſpiration, and the violent Throbbings of Heart which more and more affected us, we found that we approach'd the <hi>Grotto of Grief.</hi> It was a wide, hollow, and melancholy Cave, ſunk deep in a Dale, and watered by Rivulets that had a Colour between Red and Black. Theſe crept ſlow, and half congealed amongſt its Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and mixed their heavy Murmur with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho of Groans that rolled thro' all the Paſſages.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0187500300:199"/>In the moſt retired part of it ſat the <hi>doleful Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> her ſelf; the Path to her was ſtrewed with Goads, Stings, and Thorns; and the Throne on which ſhe ſat was broken into a Rock with ragged Pieces pointing upwards for her to lean upon. A heavy Miſt hung above her, her Head oppreſſed with it reclined upon her Arm: Thus did ſhe reign over her diſconſolate Subjects, full of her ſelf to Stupidity, in eternal Penſiveneſs, and the profoundeſt Silence. On one ſide of her ſtood <hi>Dejection</hi> juſt dropping into a Swoon, and <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> waſting to a Skeleton; on the other ſide were <hi>Care</hi> inwardly tormented with Imaginations, and <hi>Anguiſh</hi> ſuffering outward <hi>Troubles</hi> to ſuck the Blood from her Heart in the Shape of <hi>Vultures.</hi> The whole Vault had a genuine Diſmalneſs in it, which a few ſcattered Lamps, whoſe blueiſh Flames aroſe and ſunk in their Urns, diſcovered to our Eyes with Encreaſe. Some of us fell down, overcome and ſpent with what they ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the way, and were given over to thoſe Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors that ſtood on either Hand of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; others, galled and mortified with Pain, recover'd the Entrance, where <hi>Patience,</hi> whom we had left behind, was ſtill waiting to receive us.</p>
               <p>With her (whoſe Company was now become more grateful to us by the want we had found of her) we winded round the Grotto, and aſcended at the Back of it, out of the mournful Dale in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0187500300:200"/>whoſe Bottom it lay. On this Eminence we halted, by her Advice, to pant for Breath; and lifting our Eyes, which till then were fixed down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, felt a ſullen ſort of Satisfaction, in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thro' the Shades what Numbers had entred the Iſland. This Satisfaction, which appears to have Ill-nature in it, was excuſable, becauſe it happened at a time when we were too much taken up with our own Concern, to have Reſpect to that of others; and therefore we did not conſider them as ſuffering, but our ſelves as not ſuffering in the moſt forlorn Eſtate. It had alſo the Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of Humanity and Compaſſion in it, though the Mind was then too deeply engaged to perceive it; but as we proceeded onwards it began to diſcover it ſelf, and from obſerving that others were unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, we came to queſtion one another, when it was that we met, and what were the ſad Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that brought us together. Then we heard our Stories, we compared them, we mutually gave and received Pity, and ſo by degrees became to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Company.</p>
               <p>A conſiderable Part of the troubleſome Road was thus deceived; at length the Openings among the Trees grew larger, the Air ſeemed thinner, it lay with leſs Oppreſſion upon us, and we could now and then diſcern Tracts in it of a lighter Greyneſs, like the Breakings of Day, ſhort in Duration, much enlivening, and called in that Country <hi>Gleams of Amuſement.</hi> Within a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0187500300:201"/>ſhort while theſe Gleams began to appear more frequent, and then brighter and of a longer Continuance; the <hi>Sighs</hi> that hitherto filled the Air with ſo much Dolefulneſs, altered to the Sound of common Breezes, and in general the Horrors of the Iſland were abated.</p>
               <p>When we had arrived at laſt at the Ford by which we were to paſs out, we met with thoſe faſhionable Mourners who had been fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried over along with us, and who being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to go as far as we, had coaſted by the Shore to find the Place, where they waited our coming; that by ſhewing themſelves to the World only at that time when we did, they might ſeem alſo to have been among the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Grotto. Here the Waters, that rolled on the other ſide ſo deep and ſilent, were much dried up, and it was an eaſier Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for us to wade over.</p>
               <p>The River being croſſed, we were received upon the further Bank by our Friends and Acquaintance, whom <hi>Comfort</hi> had brought out to congratulate our Appearance in the World again. Some of theſe blamed us for ſtaying ſo long away from them, others adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us againſt all Temptations of going back again; every one was cautious not to renew our Trouble, by asking any Particulars of the Journey; and all concluded, that in a Caſe
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0187500300:202"/>of ſo much Affliction, we could not have made choice of a fitter Companion than <hi>Patience.</hi> Here <hi>Patience,</hi> appearing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene at her Praiſes, delivered us over to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Comfort</hi> ſmiled at his receiving the Charge; immediately the Sky purpled on that ſide to which he turned, and double Day at once broke in upon me.</p>

               <p>I Was conſidering laſt Night, when I could not ſleep, how noble a Part of the Creation Man was deſign'd to be, and how diſtinguiſhed in all his Actions above other Earthly Creatures. From whence I fell to take a view of the Change and Corruption which he has introduced into his own Condition, the groveling Appetites, the mean Characters of Senſe, and wild Courſes of Paſſions, that caſt him from the Degree in which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had placed him, the debaſing himſelf with Qualifications not his own, and his degenerating
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0187500300:204"/>into a lower Sphere of Action. This inſpired me with a mixture of Contempt and Anger; which however, was not ſo violent as to hinder the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of Sleep, but grew confuſed as that came upon me, and made me end my Reflections with giving Mankind the opprobrious Names of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate, Mad and Fooliſh.</p>
               <p>Here methought, where my waking Reaſon left the Subject, my Fancy purſued it in a Dream; and I imagined my ſelf in a loud Soliloquy of Paſſion, railing at my Species, and walking hard to get rid of the Company I deſpiſed; when two Men who had over-heard me made up on either hand. Theſe I obſerved had many Features in common, which might occaſion the Miſtake of the one for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in thoſe to whom they appear ſingle, but I, who ſaw them together, could eaſily perceive, that tho' there was an Air of Severity in each, it was tempered with a natural Sweetneſs in the one, and by turns conſtrained or ruffled by the Deſigns of Malice in the other.</p>
               <p>I was at a loſs to know the Reaſon of their joining me ſo briskly, when he whoſe Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance diſpleaſed me moſt, thus addreſſed his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. Pray, Brother, let him alone, and we ſhall immediately ſee him transformed into a Tyger. This ſtruck me with Horror, which the other perceived, and pitying my Diſorder, bid me be of good Courage, for tho' I had been Savage in my Treatment of Mankind, (whom I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0187500300:205"/>reform than rail againſt) he would, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, endeavour to reſcue me from my Danger. At this I looked a little more chearful, and while I teſtified my Reſignation to him, we ſaw the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Brother fling away from us in a Paſſion for his Diſappointment. Being now left to my Friend, I went back with him at his Deſire, that I might know the Meaning of thoſe Words which ſo affrighted me.</p>
               <p>As we went along, To inform you, ſays he, with whom you have this Adventure, my Name is <hi>Reproof</hi> and his <hi>Reproach,</hi> both born of the ſame Mother, but of different Fathers. <hi>Truth</hi> is our common Parent. <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> who ſaw her, fell in Love with her, and ſhe being pleaſed with him, he begat me upon her; but a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Enmity</hi> lying in Ambuſh for her, became the Father of him whom you ſaw along with me. The Temper of our Mother enclines us to the ſame ſort of Buſineſs, the informing Mankind of their Faults; but the differing Complexions of our Fathers make us differ in our Deſigns and Company. I have a natural Benevolence in my Mind which engages me with Friends, and he a natural Impetuoſity in his, which caſts him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Enemies.</p>
               <p>As he thus diſcourſed we came to a Place where there were three Entrances into as many ſeveral Walks, which lay beſide one another. We
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0187500300:206"/>paſſed into the middlemoſt, a plain, ſtrait, regular Walk, ſet with Trees, which added to the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Place, but did not ſo cloſe their Boughs over head as to exclude the Light from it. Here as we walked I was made to obſerve, how the Road on one hand was full of Rocks and Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices, over which <hi>Reproach</hi> (who had already gotten thither) was furiouſly driving unhappy Wretches; the other ſide was all laid out in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of gaudy Tulips, amongſt whoſe Leaves the Serpents wreath'd, and at the end of every graſſy Walk the Enchantreſs <hi>Flattery</hi> was weaving Bowers to lull Souls aſleep in. We continued ſtill walking on the middle way, 'till we arrived in a Building in which it terminated. This was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly erected by <hi>Truth</hi> for a Watch Tower, from whence ſhe took a View of the Earth, and, as ſhe ſaw occaſion, ſent out <hi>Reproof,</hi> or even <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,</hi> for our Reformation. Over the Door I took notice that a Face was carved with a Heart upon the Lips of it, and preſently call'd to Mind that this was the Antients Emblem of <hi>Sincerity.</hi> In the Entrance I met with <hi>Freedom of Speech</hi> and <hi>Complaiſance,</hi> who had for a long time look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon one another as Enemies; but <hi>Reproof</hi> has ſo happily brought them together, that they now act as Friends and Fellow-Agents in the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Before I aſcended up the Stairs, I had my Eyes purified by a Water which made me ſee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely clear, and I think they ſaid it ſprung in a Pit, from whence (as <hi>Democritus</hi> had reported)
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0187500300:207"/>they formerly brought up <hi>Truth,</hi> who had hid her ſelf in it. I was then admitted to the upper Chamber of Proſpect, which was called <hi>the Knowledge of Mankind;</hi> here the Window was no ſooner opened but I perceived the Clouds to roll off and part before me, and a Scene of all the Variety of the World preſented it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But how different was Mankind in this View, from what it uſed to appear! Methought the very Shape of moſt of them was loſt; ſome had the Heads of Dogs, others of Apes or Parrots, and in ſhort, where-ever any one took upon him the inferior and unworthy Qualities of other Creatures, the Change of his Soul became viſible in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. The ſtrutting Pride of him who is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Brutality inſtead of Courage, made his Face ſhoot out in the Form of a <hi>Horſe</hi>'s; his Eyes became prominent, his Noſtrils widened, and his Wig untying flowed down on one ſide of his Neck in a waving Mane. The Talkativeneſs of thoſe who love the ill Nature of Converſation made them turn into <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of <hi>Geeſe,</hi> their Lips hardened into Bills by eternal uſing, they gabbled for Diverſion, they hiſs'd in Scandal, and their Ruffles falling back on their Arms, a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of little Feathers appeared, which formed Wings for them to flutter with from one Viſit to another. The Envious and Malicious lay on the Ground with the Heads of different ſorts of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and not endeavouring to erect themſelves,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0187500300:208"/>but meditating Miſchief to others, they ſuck'd the Poiſon of the Earth, ſharpened their Tongues to Stings upon the Stones, and rolled their Trains unperceivably beneath their Habits. The Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Oppreſſors wore the Faces of Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles, their Mouths were Inſtruments of Cruelty, their Eyes of Deceit; they committed Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and bemoaned that there ſhould be ſo much of it in the World; they devoured the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary, and wept over the Remains of them. The Covetous had ſo hook'd and worn their Fingers by counting Intereſt upon Intereſt, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Claws of Harpies, and theſe they ſtill were ſtretching out for more, yet ſeem'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with their Acquiſitions. The Sharpers had the Looks of Camelions; they every Minute changed their Appearance, and fed on Swarms of Flies which fell as ſo many Cullies amongſt them. The Bully ſeem'd a Dunghil Cock, he creſted well, and bore his Comb aloft; he was beaten by almoſt every one, yet ſtill ſung for Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; and only the mean Coward prick'd up the Ears of a Hare to fly before him. Criticks were turned into Cats, whoſe Pleaſure and Grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling go together. Fops were Apes in embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Jackets. Flatterers were curl'd Spaniels, fawning and crouching. The Crafty had the Face of a Fox, the Slothful of an Aſs, the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el of a Wolf, the Ill-bred of a Bear, the Leach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were Goats, and the Gluttons Swine. Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs was the only Vice that did not change the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0187500300:209"/>Face of its Profeſſors into that of another Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but this I took to be far from a Privilege, for theſe two Reaſons; becauſe it ſufficiently deforms them of it ſelf, and becauſe none of the lower Ranks of Beings is guilty of ſo fooliſh an Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</p>
               <p>As I was taking a View of theſe Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Things, without any more Order than is uſual in a Dream, or in the Confuſion of the World it ſelf, I perceived a Concern within me for what I ſaw; my Eyes began to moiſten, and as if the Virtue of that Water with which they were purified was loſt for a time, by their being touched with that which aroſe from a Paſſion, the Clouds immediately began to gather again, and cloſe from either hand upon the Proſpect. I then turned towards my Guide, who addreſſed himſelf to me after this manner. You have ſeen the Condition of Mankind when it deſcends from its Dignity; now therefore guard your ſelf from that Degeneracy by a modeſt Greatneſs of Spirit on one ſide, and a conſcious Shame on the other. Endeavour alſo with a Generoſity of Goodneſs to make your Friends aware of it; let them know what Defects you perceive are growing upon them; handle the Matter as you ſee Reaſon, either with the Airs of ſevere or humorous Affection; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times plainly deſcribing the Degeneracy in its full proper Colours, or at other times letting them know that if they proceed as they have begun,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0187500300:210"/>you give them to ſuch a Day or ſo many Months to turn Bears, Wolves, or Foxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither neglect your more remote Acquaintance, where you ſee any worthy and ſuſceptible of Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; expoſe the Beaſts whoſe Qualities you ſee them putting on, where you have no mind to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with their Perſons. The Poſſibility of their applying this is very obvious: The <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſaw it ſo clearly, that they made the Pictures of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals explain their Minds to one another inſtead of Writing; and indeed it is hardly to be miſſed, ſince <hi>Aeſop</hi> took them out of their Mute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and taught them to ſpeak for themſelves with relation to the Actions of Mankind.</p>

               <p>THERE is a Sett of Mankind, who are wholly employed in the Ill-natured Office of gathering up a Collection of Stories that leſſen the Reputation of others, and ſpreading them A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with a certain Air of Satisfaction. Perhaps, indeed, an innocent and unmeaning Curioſity, a Deſire of being informed concerning thoſe we live with, or a Willingneſs to profit by Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the Actions of others, may ſometimes afford an Excuſe, or ſometimes a Defence, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitiveneſs; but certainly it is beyond all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0187500300:212"/>a Tranſgreſſion againſt Humanity, to carry the Matter further, to tear off the Dreſſings, as I may ſay, from the Wounds of a Friend, and expoſe them to the Air in cruel Fits of Diverſion; and yet we have ſomething more to bemoan, an Outrage of an higher Nature, which mankind is guilty of when they are not content to ſpread the Stories of Folly, Frailty and Vice, but even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large them, or invent new ones, and blacken Characters that we may appear ridiculous or hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to one another. From ſuch Practices as theſe it happens, that ſome feel a Sorrow, and others are agitated with a Spirit of Revenge; that Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals or Lies are told, becauſe another has told ſuch before; that Reſentments and Quarrels ariſe, and Injuries are given, received, and multiplied, in a Scene of Vengeance.</p>
               <p>All this I have often obſerved with abundance of Concern; and having a perfect Deſire to further the Happineſs of Mankind; I lately ſet my ſelf to conſider the Cauſes from whence ſuch Evils ariſe, and the Remedies which may be applied. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I ſhut my Eyes to prevent Diſtraction from outward Objects, and a while after ſhot away, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Impulſe of Thought, into the <hi>World of Ideas,</hi> where abſtracted Qualities became viſible in ſuch Appearances as were agreeable to each of their Natures.</p>
               <p>That part of the Country, where I happened
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0187500300:213"/>to light, was the moſt noiſy that I had ever known. The Winds whiſtled, the Leaves ruſtled, the Brooks rumbled, the Birds chatter'd, the Tongues of Men were heard, and the Echo mingled ſomething of every Sound in its Repetition, ſo that there was a ſtrange Confuſion and Uproar of Sounds about me. At length, as the Noiſe ſtill encreaſed, I could diſcern a Man habited like a Herald (and as I afterwards underſtood) called <hi>Novelty,</hi> that came forward proclaiming a Solemn Day to be kept at the Houſe of <hi>Common Fame.</hi> Immediately behind him advanced three Nymphs, who had monſtrous Appearances. The firſt of theſe was <hi>Curioſity,</hi> habited like a Virgin, and having an hundred Ears upon her Head to ſerve in her Enquiries. The Second of theſe was <hi>Talkativeneſs,</hi> a little better grown, ſhe ſeemed to be like a young Wife, and had an hundred Tongues to ſpread her Stories. The Third was <hi>Cenſoriouſneſs,</hi> habited like a Widow, and ſurrounded with an hundred Squinting Eyes of a malignant Influence, which ſo obliquely darted on all around, that it was impoſſible to ſay which of them had brought in the Informations ſhe boaſted of. Theſe, as I was informed, had been very inſtrumental in preſerving and rearing <hi>Common Fame,</hi> when upon her Birth-day ſhe was ſhuffled into a Crowd, to eſcape the ſearch which <hi>Truth</hi> might have made after her and her Parents. <hi>Curioſity</hi> found her there, <hi>Talkativeneſs</hi> convey'd her away, and <hi>Cenſoriouſneſs</hi> ſo nurſed her up,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0187500300:214"/>that in a ſhort time ſhe grew to a prodigious Size, and obtained an Empire over the Univerſe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Power,</hi> in Gratitude for theſe Services, has ſince advanced them to her higheſt Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The next who came forward in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion was a light Damſel, called <hi>Credulity,</hi> who carried behind them the Lamp, the Silver Veſſel with a Spout, and other Inſtruments proper for this Solemn Occaſion. She had formerly ſeen theſe three together, and conjecturing from the number of their Ears, Tongues and Eyes, that they might be the proper <hi>Genii</hi> of <hi>Attention, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Converſe,</hi> and <hi>Ocular Demonſtration,</hi> ſhe from that time gave her ſelf up to attend them. The laſt who followed were ſome who had cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muffled themſelves in upper Garments, ſo that I could not diſcern who they were; but juſt as the foremoſt of them was come up, I am glad, ſays ſhe, calling me by my Name, to meet you at this time, ſtay cloſe by me, and take a ſtrict Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of all that paſſes. Her Voice was ſweet and commanding, I thought I had ſomewhere heard it; and from her, as I went along, I learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Meaning of every thing which offered.</p>
               <p>We now marched forward thro' the <hi>Rookery</hi> of <hi>Rumours,</hi> which flew thick and with a terrible din all around us. At length we arrived at the Houſe of <hi>Common Fame,</hi> where a Hecatomb of <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> was that Day to fall for her Pleaſure. The Houſe ſtood upon an Eminence, having a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0187500300:215"/>Paſſages to it, and a thouſand whiſpering Holes for the Conveyance of Sound. The Hall we entered was formed with the Art of a Muſick-Chamber for the Improvement of Noiſes. <hi>Reſt</hi> and <hi>Silence</hi> are baniſhed the Place. <hi>Stories</hi> of different Natures wander in light Flocks all about, ſometimes Truths and Lies, or ſometimes Lies themſelves claſhing againſt one another. In the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſtood a Table painted after the manner of the remoteſt <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Countries, upon which the Lamp, the Silver Veſſel, and Cups of a white Earth, were planted in order. Then dried Herbs were brought, collected for the Solemnity in Moonſhine, and Water being put to them, there was a greeniſh Liquor made, to which they added the Flower of Milk, and an Extraction from the Canes of <hi>America,</hi> for performing a Libation to the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Powers</hi> of <hi>Miſchief.</hi> After this, <hi>Curioſity,</hi> retiring to a withdrawing-Room, brought forth the <hi>Victims,</hi> being to Appearance a Sett of ſmall waxen Images, which ſhe laid upon the Table one after another. Immediately <hi>Talkative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> gave each of them the Name of ſome one, whom for the Time they were to repreſent; and <hi>Cenſoriouſneſs</hi> ſtuck them all about with black Pins, ſtill pronouncing at every one ſhe ſtuck, ſomething to the Prejudice of the Perſons repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. No ſooner were theſe Rites performed, and Incantations uttered, but the Sound of a Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trumpet was heard in the Air, by which they knew the <hi>Deity</hi> of the Place was propitiated and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0187500300:216"/>aſſiſting. Upon this the Sky grew darker, a Storm aroſe, and Murmurs, Sighs, Groans, Cries, and the Words of Grief or Reſentment were heard within it. Thus the three <hi>Sorcereſſes</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that they, whoſe Names they had given to the Images, were already affected with what was done to them in Effigie. The Knowledge of this was received with loudeſt the Laughter, and in many Congratulatory Words they applauded one another's Wit and Power.</p>
               <p>As Matters were at this high Point of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, the muffled Lady, whom I attended on, being no longer able to endure ſuch barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Proceedings, threw off her upper Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Reſerve,</hi> and appeared to be <hi>Truth.</hi> As ſoon as ſhe had confeſſed her ſelf preſent, the Speaking-Trumpet ceas'd to Sound, the Sky clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, the Storm abated, the Noiſes which were heard in it ended, the Laughter of the Company was over, and a ſerene Light, till then unknown to the Place, was diffuſed around it. At this the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected <hi>Sorcereſſes</hi> endeavoured to eſcape in a Cloud which I ſaw began to thicken about them, but it was ſoon diſperſed, their Charms being controled and prevailed over by the ſuperior <hi>Divinity.</hi> For my Part I was exceedingly glad to ſee it ſo, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conſider what Puniſhments ſhe would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon them. I fancied it would be proper to cut off <hi>Curioſity</hi>'s Ears, and fix them to the Eaves of Houſes, to nail the Tongue of <hi>Talkativeneſs</hi> to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0187500300:217"/>
                  <hi>Indian</hi> Tables, and to put out the Eyes of <hi>Cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs</hi> with a Flaſh of her Light. In reſpect of <hi>Credulity</hi> I had indeed ſome little Pity, and had I been Judge ſhe might, perhaps, have eſcaped with a hearty Reproof.</p>
               <p>But I ſoon found that the diſcerning <hi>Judge</hi> had other Deſigns, ſhe knew them for ſuch as will not be deſtroyed intirely while Mankind is in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet ought to have a Brand and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment affixed to them that they may be avoided. Wherefore ſhe took a Seat for Judgment, and had the <hi>Criminals</hi> brought forward by <hi>Shame</hi> ever bluſhing, and <hi>Trouble</hi> with a Whip of many Laſhes, two Phantoms who had dogged the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in Diſguiſe, and waited 'till they had an Authority from <hi>Truth</hi> to lay Hands upon them. Immediately then ſhe ordered <hi>Curioſity</hi> and <hi>Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ativeneſs</hi> to be fettered together, that the one ſhould never ſuffer the other to reſt, nor the other ever let her remain undiſcovered. Light <hi>Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> ſhe linkt to <hi>Shame</hi> at the Tormenter's own Requeſt, who was pleaſed to be thus ſecure that her Priſoner could not eſcape; and this was done partly for her Puniſhment, and partly for her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment. <hi>Cenſoriouſneſs</hi> was alſo in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner begged by <hi>Trouble,</hi> and had her aſſign'd for an eternal Companion. After they were thus chain'd with one another, by the Judge's Order, ſhe drove them from the Preſence to wander for ever thro' the World, with <hi>Novelty</hi> ſtalking before them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0187500300:218"/>The Cauſe being now over, ſhe retreated from ſight within the Splendor of her own Glory, which leaving the Houſe it had brightned, the Sounds that were proper to the Place began to be as loud and confuſed as when we entered, and there being no longer a clear diſtinguiſhed Appearance of any Objects repreſented to me, I returned from the Excurſion I had made in Fancy.</p>

               <head>VISION V.</head>
               <p>WHatever Induſtry and Eagerneſs the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Diſcoverers have ſhewn for the Knowledge of new Countries, there yet remains an ample Field in the Creation to which they are utter Strangers, and which all the Methods of Travelling hitherto invented, will never bring them acquainted with. Of this I can give a very particular Inſtance in an Accident which lately happened to me.</p>
               <p>As I was on the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this Inſtant, being <hi>Febr.</hi> 1715, walking with my Eyes caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I fell into a Reflection on the vaſt Tracts of Air which appear'd before me as uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0187500300:220"/>And wherefore, ſaid I to my ſelf, ſhou'd all this Space be created? Can it only be for an odd Bird to fly through, as now and then a Man may paſs a Deſart? Or are there alſo Kingdoms with their particular Polities, and People of a Species which we know nothing of, ordain'd to live in it.</p>
               <p>It was in this Manner I continued my Thought, when my Feet forſook the Level, and I was inſenſibly mounted in the Air, till I arriv'd at a footing as firm and level as what I had left. But with what Surpriſe did I find my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Creatures diſtinct from us in Shape and Cuſtoms?</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants are of a ſmall Stature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe which Hiſtory deſcribes for Pigmies. The talleſt of them exceed not fourteen or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Inches, and the leaſt are hardly three. This difference proceeds only from their Growth before they are brought to Light; for after we never obſerve them to grow, unleſs it pleaſe their Parents, who have this uncommon Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of enabling them: They recall them to the Womb, where having been for ſome Time, they receive an Addition to their Bulk, then go back to their Houſes, and continue at a Stand as they did before. The Experiment has been often try'd with Succeſs, but ſome have ſuffered extremely by undergoing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0187500300:221"/>Their Skins are like the antient <hi>Britains,</hi> all drawn over with a Variety of Figures. The Colour made uſe of for this end, is generally Black. I have indeed obſerv'd in ſome of the Religious, and Lawyers of the Country, Red here and there intermingl'd, tho' not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of late. They tell me too, they often us'd to paint with all Colours; and I viſited two or three of the old Inhabitants, who were adorn'd in that Faſhion: But this is now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed, ſince the new Inventions, by which the uſe of a black Fountain that belongs to that Country, is render'd more uſeful and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cloaths</hi> in which they go clad, are the Skins of Beaſts, worn by ſome Plain, by others with Figures wrought upon them. Gold is alſo made uſe of by ſome, to beautify their Apparel; but very ſeldom Silver, unleſs, as Buckles are by us, for faſtening the Garment before. I have ſeen ſome of them go like Seamen in thin blue Shirts, others like <hi>Indians</hi> in a party-colour'd looſe kind of Apparel, and others who they told me were the <hi>Politicians</hi> of the Country, go about ſtark naked.</p>
               <p>The Manner of dreſſing them is this: At firſt when they come into the World, they have a Suit given them, which if it do not fit
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0187500300:222"/>exactly, is not, as with us, fitted up again, but the Children are in a cruel Manner cut and ſqueez'd to bring them to its Proportion. Yet this they ſeem not much to regard, provided their principal Parts are not affected. When the Dreſs is thus ſettled on them, they are clad for Life, it being ſeldom their Cuſtom to alter it, or put it off: In ſhort, they live in it Night and Day, and wear it to Rags rather than part with it, being ſure of the ſame Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a greater Danger if they ſhou'd be dreſs'd a ſecond Time. I have further taken Notice, that they delight to go open Breaſted, moſt of them ſhewing their Boſoms ſpeckled. Some <hi>Lawyers</hi> indeed wear them quite White, perhaps for Diſtinction ſake, or to be known at a Diſtance. But the fineſt Shew, is among the Beaux and Ladies, who mightily affect ſomething of Gold, both before and behind them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Food</hi> I never ſaw them eat; they being a People, who, as I obſerved, live in Air: Their <hi>Houſes</hi> are all ſingle and high, having no back Rooms, but frequently ſeven or eight Stories, which are all ſeparate Houſes above one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They have one Gate to their City, and generally no Doors to their Houſes; tho' I have ſometimes ſeen them have particular Doors, and even made of Glaſs, where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants have been obſerv'd to ſtand many
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0187500300:223"/>Days, that their fine Apparel may be ſeen thro' them. If at any time they lye down, which they do when they come from their Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (as if coming Abroad were their greateſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue) they will lie together in Heaps without receiving Hurt: Though the ſoundeſt Sleep they get, is when they can have Duſt enough to cover them over.</p>
               <p>The Females amongſt them are but few, nothing being there produced by a Marriage of Sexes. The Males are of a different Strength or Endowment of Parts, ſome having Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in an extream Degree, and others none at all; yet at the ſame Time, they are mighty Pretenders to inſtruct others. Their <hi>Names,</hi> (for as many as wou'd diſcover them to me) I obſerv'd to be the very ſame as ours are upon Earth; I met a few who made theirs a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, but why, I am yet to learn. They are ſo communicative, that they will tell all the Knowledge they boaſt, if a Stranger apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to their Converſation: And this may be worth his while, if he conſiders that all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, Arts, and Sciences, are profeſt amongſt them. I think I may ſay it without Vanity, that I knew a certain <hi>Taliſman,</hi> with proper Figures and Characters inſcrib'd, whereby their greateſt People may be charm'd, brought to reſide with a Man, and ſerve him like a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar in the Conduct of Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0187500300:224"/>There is no ſuch thing as <hi>fighting</hi> amongſt them, but their Controverſies are determin'd by <hi>Words,</hi> wherein they ſeldom own themſelves conquer'd, yet proceed no further than two or three Replies: Perhaps indeed two others take up their Neighbour's Quarrel, but then they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt too after the ſame Manner; ſometimes how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Blows have enſu'd upon their Account, though not amongſt them: In ſuch a Caſe they have deſcended to inſpire Mankind with their Sentiments, and choſen Champions from among us, in order to decide it.</p>
               <p>The Time of their <hi>Life</hi> is very different, ſome dye as ſoon as born, and others in their Youth; ſome get a new Leaſe of Life by their entring into the Womb again, and if any weather it out to a hundred Years, they generally live on to an extreme Age. After which it is remarkable, that inſtead of growing weaker as we do, by Time, they increaſe in Strength, and become at laſt ſo confirm'd in Health, that it is the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Country, they never can periſh while the World remains.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sickneſſes</hi> which may take them off, beſides what happens from their natural Weakneſs of Body, are of different Sorts. One is <hi>over-moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> which affecting their Manſions, makes them loſe their Complexions, become deform'd, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0187500300:225"/>rot away inſenſibly: This is often obviated by their not keeping too much within Doors. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other is the <hi>Worms,</hi> which prey upon their Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els: If they be maim'd by Accidents, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, like us, ſo far uſeleſs; and that Maim will ſome time or other be the Occaſion of their Ruin. However, they periſh by theſe Means only in Appearance, and like Spirits, who vaniſh in one Place, to be ſeen in another. But as Men dye of Paſſions, ſo <hi>Diſeſteem</hi> is what the moſt near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touches them; then they withdraw into, Holes and Corners, and conſume away in Darkneſs. Or if they are kept alive a few Days by the force of <hi>Spices,</hi> it is but a ſhort Reprieve from their periſhing to Eternity; without any Honour, but that inſtead of a Burial, a ſmall Pyre of <hi>Paſt</hi> ſhou'd be erected over them, while they, like the antient <hi>Romans,</hi> are reduc'd to Aſhes.</p>
