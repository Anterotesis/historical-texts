            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHAT gave Occaſion to the
following <hi>Eſſay</hi> is briefly
what follows, my learned and
worthy Friend Dr. <hi>Cheyne,</hi>
ſome rears ago publiſhed an Eſſay upon
<hi>Health and long Life,</hi> in which he
gave a Proof both of his Judgment
and Humanity. This Book was receiv'd
by the Publick, with the Reſpect that
was due to the Importance of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents;
it became the Subject of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
and produc'd even Sects in
the dietetick Philoſophy. In ſome of
thoſe ſympoſiac Diſputations amongſt my
Acquaintance, being appeal'd to; I
happen'd to affirm that the dietetick Part
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0412300600:3"/>
of Medicine depended, as much as any
of the reſt, upon ſcientifick Principles:
Being call'd upon to make good my Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
I compos'd the following ſhort
Treatiſe which is properly ſpeaking only
an Eſſay or Attempt of a <hi>Phyſiology
of Aliment.</hi> The moſt of it was wrote
in a Situation, where I had no Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
except from Extracts out of ſome
imperfect Editions of the Works of the
moſt learned and induſtrious <hi>Boerhaave,</hi>
and from a very excellent Edition of his
Chymiſtry by Dr. <hi>Shaw,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
This I am oblig'd to ſay once
for all, to ſave my ſelf the Trouble of
perpetual Quotations: The Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ill Health, and Abſence from my
Books in which I compos'd it, and the
Want of Leiſure ſince to correct it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently,
may he ſome Excuſe for the
Want of that Accuracy which the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
deſerves, and which I frankly
own, I have diſcover'd in ſome Things
of ſmall moment ſince the Book was
printed off. I am likewiſe obliged to
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0412300600:4"/>
make uſe of a very common and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
Reaſon for publiſhing it at this
Time, <hi>viz.</hi> the Approbation of ſome
Friends who perus'd it, and perſuaded
me that it might be of ſome Uſe to the
Publick. I can ſay but little of the
Merit of the Performance, but a great
deal of that of the Subject; for ſurely
the Choice and Meaſure of the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
of which the whole Body is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
and what we take daily by
Pounds, is at leaſt of as much Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
as of what we take ſeldom, and
only by Grains and Spoonfuls.</p>
            <p>The Reader muſt not be ſurpriz'd to
find the moſt common and ordinary
Facts taken notice of: In Subjects of
this Nature there is no room for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention;
many important Conſequences
may be drawn from the Obſervation of
the moſt common Things, and analogous
Reaſonings from the Cauſes of them.</p>
            <p>I believe a Reader with as much
Anatomy as a Butcher knows, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Skill in Mechanicks, may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0412300600:5"/>
the whole Eſſay, provided he
goes through it at Leiſure, and with
Attention: To a Perſon ſo qualify'd
many Obſervations concerning his own
Conſtitution will occur, which I was
not capable of making; as for the hard
Words which I was oblig'd to uſe,
they are either Terms of Art, or ſuch
as I ſubſtituted in the place of others,
that were too low, and vulgar; the
Reader will find moſt of them explain'd
at the Beginning of the Book: And
I hope an Indulgence to a few, will
not be reckon'd an Indignity to the reſt;
and that I ſhall not be ſuſpected of
Affectation, where my principal Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was Perſpicuity. In Subjects of
this Kind, one is oblig'd in the ſame
Paragraph, to join many Particulars
together in one Propoſition; becauſe the
Repetition of the Subſtantive Verb
would be tedious and unneceſſary. This
hinders the Stile from being ſmooth,
but not from being perſpicuous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0412300600:6"/>
I have laid a Plan for treating the
other Parts of Diet, as Air, Reſt, and
Motion after the ſame Manner; but I
am oblig'd to delay the Execution of
my Deſign till I have more Leiſure.</p>
            <p>I do not preſume to inſtruct the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of my own Profeſſion; and if
any of them ſhall inſtruct me better, I
declare before-hand that I am very
willing to be convinc'd: I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
any Miſtake, and at the ſame
time I do not think my ſelf oblig'd to
anſwer every frivolous Objection.</p>

            <head>THE
EXPLANATION
OF SOME
CHYMICAL TERMS
Uſed in the following
ESSAY.</head>
            <p>AS the following Treatiſe is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſign'd for Perſons not bred
up in the Profeſſion of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
it is neceſſary to give a
general Notion of the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſome Chymical Words that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
occur in it.</p>
            <p>The Principles of Natural Bodies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Chymiſts, are Water, Earth,
Oil, Salt, Spirit, of all which every one
has ſome general Notion; but the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:0412300600:24"/>
of the Names and Qualities of Salts
and Spirits occaſions ſome Confuſion in
the Minds of ſuch as are ignorant of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry.</p>
            <p>The Chymiſts define Salt from ſome
of its Properties, to be a Body fuſible in
the Fire, congealable again by Cold into
britle Glebes or Cryſtals, ſoluble in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo as to diſappear, not malleable, and
having ſomething in it which affecteth
the Organs of Taſte with a Senſation of
Acrimony or Sharpneſs. Of Native Salts
there are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Sea-Salt and Sal Gemmae, or
Rock-Salt which are of the ſame Nature.
The firſt in all appearance being a Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Second in the Water of the
Ocean; theſe two are perfect Salts, fixt,
and immutable by any Power in Animal
Bodies; for the other Salts are never
found in the Urine of any Animal that
ſwallows them down, but Sea-Salt is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
found in the Urine of every Animal
that takes it, and in no other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Sal Nitre, or Sal Petre, which
is more eaſily diſſolv'd by Fire, and leſs
eaſily by Water than any other Salt, it is
cold and affects the Tongue like a ſaltiſh
Ice: It ſeems to be of a middle Nature
between Foſſile and Animal, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
from Animal Excrements inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd
with vegetable Salts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:0412300600:25"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Sal Ammoniac of two Sorts,
the ancient deſcribed by <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides</hi>
no more to be found: And the
Modern which is a Compound of Foſſile,
Animal and Vegetable Salt. This Salt
cools Water, it is fix'd in a gentle Fire
and ſublimes in a great one, its Taſte is
quicker than that of common Salt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
that of Urine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Borax, a Foſſile Salt of a
ſweetiſh Taſte, it promotes the Fuſion of
Metals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Alum, which tho' no pure Salt,
has moſt of the Properties of Salts, being
ſoluble in Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Salts are divided into Acid and Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line:
Of Acid or Sour, one has a Notion
from Taſte; Sourneſs being one of thoſe
ſimple Ideas, which one cannot more
plainly deſcribe. What being mix'd with
an Acid cauſeth an Efferveſcence, is call'd
an Alkali.</p>
            <p>Efferveſcence in the Chymical Senſe,
ſignifies an inteſtine Commotion, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by mixing two Bodies together, that
lay at reſt before; attended ſometimes
with a hiſſing Noiſe, Froathing, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition:
For Example, let us place in
the firſt Claſs, Acids as Vinegar, Juice of
Lemons, Juice of Oranges, Spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
Spirit of Alum: In the ſecond Claſs,
other Saline Subſtances obtain'd from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:0412300600:26"/>
and Vegetables, by Diſtillation,
Putrefaction, Calcination, as Spirit of
Urine, Spirit of Harts-horn, Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar;
becauſe the Subſtances of the ſecond
Claſs, being mix'd with the Subſtances of
the firſt raiſe an Efferveſcence, they are
call'd Alkalis. There is a third Claſs of
Subſtances, commonly call'd Abſorbents,
as the various Kinds of Shels, Coral,
Chalk, Crabs-eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which being
mix'd with the firſt Claſs, likewiſe raiſe
an Efferveſcence, and are therefore call'd
Alkalis, tho' not ſo properly; for they
are not Salts and have nothing common
with the ſecond Claſs, except this Quality
of fermenting with Acids.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable that a violent Cold, as
well as Heat may be produced by this
Ebullition; for if Sal Ammoniac, or any
pure volatile Alkali diſſolv'd in Water be
mix'd with an Acid; an Ebullition with
a great Degree of Cold will enſue, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I think (with leave of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts)
Efferveſcence not ſo proper a Word
to expreſs this inteſtine Motion. There
is another Criterion of Acid and Alkali
by the Change of Colour which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
in ſome Bodies; for Example, thoſe
Liquors, which being pour'd to the Syrup
of Violets turn it red, are Acids; thoſe
which change it into a green Colour, are
reckon'd Alkalis. Thus Oil of Vitriol
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:0412300600:27"/>
Syrup of Violets red, and Oil of
Tartar green.</p>
            <p>The Word Alkali, comes from an Herb
call'd by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Kali. This Herb
they burnt to Aſhes, boil'd them in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and after having evaporated the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
there remain'd at the bottom a white
Salt, this they call'd Sal Kali, or Alkali.
It is corroſive, producing Putrefaction in
Animal Subſtances, to which it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd.</p>
            <p>Subſtances which are not perfectly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
but naturally turn ſo, I call Aceſcent.
Subſtances which are not perfectly Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
but naturally turn ſo, I call Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcent.</p>
            <p>Theſe are not Qualities in Bodies mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imaginary, but have very different and
contrary Effects upon Human Bodies.</p>
            <p>Salts which are neither Acid nor Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaline,
are call'd Neutral, ſo are Sal Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac,
Sea-Salt, Sal Gemmae, Borax,
Alum, Nitre, which as long as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Saline Quality, are neither A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
nor Alkaline. But the Chymical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
of them all (except Sal Ammoniac)
are generally Acid.</p>
            <p>Fix'd Salts are ſuch as ſuſtain the Fire
without flying away.</p>
            <p>Volatile Salts fly away with a ſmall
Heat, affecting the Noſe with an urinous
Smell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:0412300600:28"/>
There are volatile and fix'd Alkalis.</p>
            <p>The eſſential Salts of Plants are ſuch
as ſhoot upon the Sides of the Veſſels,
which contain their expreſs'd Juices.</p>
            <p>In Diſtillations what trickles down the
Sides of the Receiver in certain unctious
Rivulets, if it will not mix with Water,
it is call'd Oil, if it will mix with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it is call'd Spirits; Spirits are either
inflammable, or not inflammable. The laſt
either Acid or Alkaline. Alkaline Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
are ſubtile volatile Liquors, that run
in Veins down the Sides of the Receiver
in Diſtillations, which will not take Fire,
mix with Water, and contain ſome Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaline
Salt, as Spirit of Harts-horn. Such
are obtain'd from all the Parts of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
from all Plants by Putrefaction, and
from the pungent Kind, as Muſtard,
Horſe-Radiſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without it. Acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are ſubtile Liquors which come over
in Diſtillations, not inflammable, miſcible
with Water, ſuch are obtain'd from Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables
diſtill'd with Water, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
from Foſſils; inflammable Spirits are
ſubtile volatile Liquors which come over
in Diſtillations, miſcible with Water, and
wholly combuſtible; ſuch Spirits are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable
from Plants by a previous Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
and not without it. By the
Spirit of a Plant or that of an Animal,
we underſtand that pure elaborated Oil,
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:0412300600:29"/>
which by reaſon of its extreme Volatility
exhales ſpontaneouſly, in which the Odour
or Smell conſiſts.</p>
            <p>Soap is a Mixture of a fix'd Alkaline
Salt and Oil, in common Uſe its Virtues
are cleanſing, penetrating, attenuating and
reſolving. Any Mixture of any oily Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
with Salt may be call'd a Soap.</p>
            <p>Bodies of this Nature are call'd Sapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naceous.</p>
            <p>He who would skilfully treat of the
Nature and Choice of different Sorts of
Aliment, ought to draw his Obſervations
from the following Particulars. <hi>Firſt,</hi>
From the Alterations which the Aliment
undergoes in its Paſſage into the Blood.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> From the Alteration it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes
during its Circulation with the
Blood. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From the Nature and
moſt ſimple Analyſis of Vegetable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
<hi>Fourthly,</hi> From the Nature and
moſt ſimple Analyſis of Animal Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<hi>Fifthly,</hi> He ought to treat of the
Effects of different Sorts of Alimentary
Subſtanees upon the Fluids and Solids of
a Human Body. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Intentions to be purſued in the
Choice of Aliment in different Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Tho' I have neither Time, Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
nor Obſervations ſufficient to handle
thoſe Particulars ſo fully as they deſerve,
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:0412300600:30"/>
I hope at leaſt to give a Specimen how
they ought to be treated.</p>
            <p>This is agreeable to the Doctrine of
<hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who tells you in his firſt
Book of Diet, that to write duly upon it,
one muſt underſtand the Nature of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and of the Perſon it is given to.</p>
            <p>For the Eaſe of the Reader, I have ſet
down every thing in diſtinct Propoſitions
with Inferences and Obſervations; the
firſt in <hi>Roman,</hi> the other in common

               <p>MASTICATION is a very
neceſſary Preparation of ſolid
Aliment, without which there can
be no good Digeſtion. By chewing,
ſolid Aliment is divided into ſmall
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0412300600:32"/>
Parts; in a human Body, there is no
other Inſtrument to perform this
Action, but the Teeth. By the Action
of chewing, the Spittle and Mucus is
ſqueez'd from the Glands, and mix'd
with the Aliment, which Action if
it be long continued, will turn the
Aliment into a ſort of Chyle. The
Spittle is an active Liquor, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
deriv'd from the arterial Blood.
It is ſaponaceous, as appears by its
froathing, and likewiſe by diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and conſequently is attenuating,
reſolving, penetrating, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.
After long Abſtinence, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
acrid, and copious, it fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with the juices of Vegetables,
and conſequently diſpoſeth them to
be chang'd into inflamable Spirits,
it diſcovereth its Virtues in ſeveral
Chirurgical uſes. Beſides, in the action
of chewing, the Mucus (which is an
Humour different from the Spittle,
and by its Viſcidity collects Air) mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with the Aliment, and helps to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0412300600:33"/>
attenuate it. The neceſſity of Saliva
or Spittle to diſſolve the Aliment, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from the contrivance of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in making the ſalivary Ducts of
Animals, which ruminate or chew the
Cud, extremely open. Such Animals
as ſwallow their Aliment without
chewing, want ſalivary Glands; and
Birds have them placed in their Maw.
There are inſtances of Men who
ſwallow'd their Meat whole, but
Ruminated or chew'd the Cud after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
(Rumination is given to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
to enable them at once to lay
up a great ſtore of Food and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to chew it.) And Animals ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
more upon Hay than Graſs,
the Food being harder. From all
which Obſervations it appears, that
the Solution of the Aliment by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication
is very neceſſary; and that
without it the Aliment could not be
duly diſpoſed; for the other changes
which it receives as it paſſeth through
the Alimentary duct.</p>

a decay of Appetite. This has been
confirm'd by Experience in ſeveral,
who have made it their conſtant cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
to chew Maſtick; chewing and
ſmoaking of Tobacco is only good
in phlegmatick People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The humour of Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Inſtruments of Maſtication, by a
paralytical diſpoſition, or by the want
of Teeth, as in old Men and Infants,
is a natural Indication of a liquid
Dyet, as of Milk and Broaths, and
even ſuch of them as take Solids

               <p>The Change which is made of the
Aliment in the Stomach, is effected
by Attrition of the ſolid Parts, or
inward Coat of the Stomach, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0412300600:35"/>
the action of a diſſolvent Liquor
aſſiſted with Heat.</p>
               <p>The Liquor in the Stomach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of that which is ſeparated from
its inward Coat; of the Spittle,
which is almoſt continually ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
and the Liquor which diſtills
from the Gullet. By the help of this
Liquor, and the conſtant Attrition
of the ſolid Parts, the Aliment is
diſſolv'd by an Operation reſembling
that of making an Emulſion, in
which Operation the Oyly parts of
Nutts and Seeds being gently ground
in a Marble Mortar, and gradually
mix'd with ſome watery Liquor, are
diſſolv'd into a ſweet, thick, turbid
milky Liquor, reſembling the Chyle
in an Animal Body. That the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
in Animals levigates the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
which it receives, is evident
from the Diſſection of ſome Animals
which have ſwallow'd Metals,
which have been found poliſh'd on
the ſide next the Stomach. Birds being
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0412300600:36"/>
without Teeth to make the firſt
preparation of their Aliment, have
ſtrong and nervous Stomachs, to
make this Attrition the ſtronger;
and this motion in them hath been
both ſeen and heard. The Rugae or
Plyes of the inward Coat of the
Stomach contribute to the detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Aliment in the Stomach.
The Heat in Land Animals helps
likewiſe to the Solution of the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but not much, for Fiſhes
have a ſtrong digeſtion without it,
tho' by the tryal of the Thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope,
they have more heat than the
Element which they ſwim in. It has
been ſhow'd before that the Spittle
is a great Diſſolvent, and there is a
great quantity of it in the Stomach,
being ſwallow'd conſtantly, at leaſt
in Sleep. He who eats a Pound of
Bread ſwallows at leaſt as much Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
as Bread. This Liquor of the
Stomach in a ſound ſtate is not Acid,
for it has been found by Experiments,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0412300600:37"/>
that Pearls have paſs'd through Cocks
and Hens undiſſolv'd.</p>
               <p>1. The Liquor of the Stomach,
which with faſting grows extremely
Acrid, and the quick ſenſation of the
inward villous Coat of the Stomach,
ſeem to be the cauſe of the Senſe of
Hunger.</p>
               <p>2. Such as have, by the uſe of
ſpirituous Liquors, weaken'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
ſome of the ſolid parts of the
Stomach, cannot recover a right
Digeſtion, for this inward villous Coat
when deſtroy'd cannot be reſtor'd.</p>
               <p>3. This Liquor of the Stomach
may (by reaſon of ſome ſaline Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony)
be made of ſome determined
quality, and affect human Creatures
with Appetites of other Animals,
which in that caſe they can take
without hurt; or it may likewiſe
occaſion an exorbitant Appetite of
uſual things, which they will take in
ſuch quantities till they vomit it up
like Dogs, from whence it is call'd
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0412300600:38"/>
Canine; in the firſt caſe the Organs
of Taſte are vitiated; both Diſeaſes
are cur'd by Dyet, oppoſite to this
Acrimony, whether Alkaline, Acid or
Muriatick.</p>
               <p>4. Thirſt and Hunger denote the
ſtate of the Spittle, and Liquor of
the Stomach. Thirſt is the ſign of
an Acrimony commonly Alkaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
or Muriatick.</p>
               <p>5. A Paralytical diſpoſition of the
Nerves of the Stomach, a deprav'd
condition of the Liquor of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
ſomething viſcous, fat and
oyly remaining there, deſtroys the
Senſation of Hunger.</p>
               <p>6. The Action of the Stomach is
totally ſtop'd by too great Repleti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in which caſe both the Orifices
of the Stomach by a neceſſary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſm
cloſe, and neither will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
nor expel any thing. In which
caſe relaxing, as by warm Water, is
the only proper Expedient.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0412300600:39"/>
The Signs of the Functions of the
Stomach being deprav'd, are Pains
in the Stomach many Hours after
Repaſt; Eructations either with the
Taſte of the Aliment Acid, Nido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe,
or Foetid, reſembling the Taſte
of rotten Eggs; Inflations, or the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of Fulneſs; Sickneſs, Hickup,
Vomiting, a Fluſhing in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
Foulneſs of the Tongue. In
general, whatever be the State of the
Tongue, the ſame is that of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Coat of the Stomach. When
the Taſte of the Mouth is bitter, it
is a Sign of a Redundance of a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Alkali, and demands a quite
different Dyet from the caſe of Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
or Sowerneſs.</p>

Digeſtion is a Fermentation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
becauſe there is all the Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites
of ſuch a Fermentation, Heat,
Air and Motion, but it is not a
compleat Fermentation, becauſe that
requires a greater Time than the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of the Aliment in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.
Vegetable Putrefaction reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
very much Animal Digeſtion.
Vegetable Putrefaction is produced
by throwing Green ſucculent Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables
in a Heap in open warm Air,
and preſſing them together, by which
all Vegetables acquire, <hi>Firſt,</hi> A Heat
equal to that of a Human Body.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> A putrid ſtercoraceous Taſte
and Odour, in Taſte reſembling pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid
Fleſh, and in Smell Human Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
This putrid Matter being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd,
affords, <hi>Firſt,</hi> A Water im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with an urinous Spirit,
like that obtainable from Animal
Subſtances, which Water is ſeperable
into Elementary Water, and a vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Animal Salt. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile

remainder being calcin'd affords no

as if the Subject had not been
Vegetable, but Animal. Putrefaction
utterly deſtroys the ſpecifick Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of one Vegetable from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
converting them into a pulpy
Subſtance of an Animal Nature:
Making the ſame Alteration very
near as if the Vegetable had gone
through the Body of a ſound Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
for tho' ſuch an Animal ſhould
entirely live upon Acids, no Part of
its Body affords any acid fix'd Salt.

               <p>The Gall is the principal Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of the Aliment, and when it is
peccant or deficient, there can be no
right Digeſtion.</p>
               <p>The Bile is of two Sorts, the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
or that contain'd in the Gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bladder,
which is a ſort of Repoſitory
for the Gall, and the Hepatick or what
flows immediately from the Liver. The
Cyſtick Gall is thick and intenſly bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſo that one Drop of it will make a
whole Pint of Water bitter. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patick
Gall is more fluid and not ſo
bitter. There is no other bitter Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in a Human Body, beſides
Gall, except the Wax of the Ear.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0412300600:43"/>
The Gall is not a perfect Alkali, for
it does not ferment with an Acid,
but it is Alkaleſcent, entirely oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to Aceſcents, and ſoon corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and convertible into a Corroſive
Alkali. It is a ſaponaceous Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
being compos'd of an Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Salt, Oyl and Water, all which
can be extracted from it. The Bile,
like Soap, takes out Spots from Wool
or Silk, and the Painters uſe it to
mix their Colours; by this ſapona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous
Quality, it mixeth the oyly
and watery Parts of the Aliment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
But tho' the Bile be an Oyl,
it is not combuſtible till dry. Theſe
Qualities make it a moſt powerful
and proper Diſſolvent, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by Experience. The Milk in
the Stomach of Calves, which is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated
by the Runnet, is again diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd,
and rendered fluid by the Gall
in the <hi>Duodenum.</hi> Voracious Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
and ſuch as do not chew, have
a great Quantity of Gall, and ſome
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0412300600:44"/>
of them have the Biliary Duct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
into the <hi>Pylorus.</hi> It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the chief Inſtrument (by its Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritation)
of the periſtaltick Motion of
the Guts. Such as have the Bile
peccant or deficient are reliev'd by
Bitters, which are a ſort of ſubſidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Gall. The learned <hi>Boorhaave</hi> has
found the Gall of an Eel, which is
moſt intenſely bitter, a moſt effectual
Remedy in ſuch Caſes. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Symptoms of the Excretion of
the Bile being vitiated, are a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh
Colour of the Skin, white
hard Foeces, a Loſs of Appetite, a
lixivial Urine.</p>

               <p>The Bile is ſo acrid, that of itſelf
it could not be admitted into the
Lacteal Veſſels. Therefore Nature

The Pancreas is a large ſalivary
Gland ſeparating about a Pound of
an Humour like Spittle, in twelve
Hours. The Bile mix'd with Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
loſeth its Bitterneſs in time, and
even Wormwood eat with Bread
will do ſo, becauſe it is mix'd with
a great quantity of Spittle. The pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juice likewiſe mixeth the

Chyle Homogeneous. When the Bile

               <p>Acrimony and Tenacity are the

moſt to be avoided.</p>
               <p>The papillous inward Coat of the

when the Acrimony is ſo great as to
affect the ſolid Parts, the Senſation of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0412300600:46"/>
Pain is intolerable. The periſtaltick

not ſuffer the leaſt Matter to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to one Point the leaſt inſtant
of Time; for the ſmalleſt quantity
of Turpentine or Pitch will ſtick to
the Fingers, but not to the Guts.
But this Motion in ſome Human
Creatures may be weak in reſpect to
the Viſcidity of what is taken ſo as
not to be able to propell it, the
conſequence of which is dangerous,
and perhaps fatal to the Life of the
Creature. Subſtances hard, cannot
be diſſolv'd, but they will paſs; but
ſuch whoſe Tenacity exceeds the
Powers of Digeſtion will neither paſs
nor be converted into Aliment. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the Mouths of the Lacteals
may permit Aliment too acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

enter in People of Lax Conſtitutions,
whereas their Sphincters will ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them in ſuch as have ſtrong

Fibres. The Mouths of the Lacteals
may be ſhut up by a viſcid <hi>Mucus,</hi>
in which caſe the Chyle paſſeth by
Stool, and the Perſon falleth into an
Atrophy.</p>
               <p>1. Fat or Oyl is neceſſary, as for
Animal Motion, ſo likewiſe for this
periſtaltick Motion, of the Inteſtines,
and lean People often ſuffer for want
of it, as fat People may by Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

               <p>The Mechaniſm of Nature in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting

<hi>Secondly,</hi> By the Action of

them together. This is evident, if

<hi>Saliva</hi> mix'd with the Aliment in
chewing. He that eats a Pound of
Bread mixeth it very near with as
much Spittle, and this ſeparated from
Glands that weigh only about four
Ounces. Afterwards, the ſame Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is mix'd with the Liquor of
the Stomach, the Bile and pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Juice, and if we compute the

from the Weight of theſe <hi>Viſcera</hi> in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0412300600:49"/>
reſpect of the ſalivary Glands, we ſhall
find ſtill a vaſtly greater quantity of
theſe Animal Juices mix'd with the
Aliment; this is not all, for when
the Chyle paſſeth through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery,
it is mix'd with the Lymph
(which is the moſt ſpirituous and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laborated
Part of the Blood) from
the Glands of the Meſentery: So
that the Juices of an Animal Body
are as it were<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> new diſtill'd</note> cohobated, being
excreted and admitted again into the
Blood with the freſh Aliment; all
the while the ſolid Parts act upon
the Mixture of Aliment and Animal
Juices ſo as to make the Mixture
more perfect; beſides, none of theſe
Juices, except the Liquor of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,
are mix'd with the Foeces of
an Animal, which in a ſound State
are hard. So that one may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
that a Pound of Bread before
it enters the Blood, is mix'd perhaps
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0412300600:50"/>
with four times the quantity of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Juices. The ſame Oeconomy
is obſerv'd in the Circulation of the
Chyle with the Blood, by mixing it
intimately with the Parts of the Fluid
to which it is to be aſſimilated.</p>
               <p>1. From whence it follows, that
an Animal whoſe Juices are unſound
or ſolid Parts weak can never be duly
nouriſh'd, for unſound Juices can never
duly repair the Fluids and Solids of
an Animal Body, and without a due
Action of the ſolid Parts, they never
can be well mix'd. The Stomach,
the Inteſtines, the Muſcles of the
lower Belly, all act upon the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
beſides, the Chyle is not ſuck'd
but ſqueez'd into the Mouths of the
Lacteals by the Action of the Fibres
of the Guts: The Mouths of the
Lacteals are open'd by the inteſtinal
Tube, affecting a ſtreight inſtead of
a ſpiral Cylinder. Thus it is plain,
that the Chyle muſt be peccant in
Quantity or Quality when theſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0412300600:51"/>
and Organs are too weak, and
whatever ſtrengthens the ſolid Parts
muſt help the Digeſtion.</p>
               <p>2. Diarhaeas and ſtrong Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
muſt ſpoil the firſt Digeſtion,
becauſe of the great Quantities of

               <p>The Obſtruction of the Glands of

to Nutrition, for the Lymph in thoſe
Glands is a neceſſary Conſtituent of
the Aliment before it mixeth with
the Blood, and for the ſame Reaſon
young Animals are moſt and beſt
nouriſh'd, for the meſenterick Glands
are largeſt in the Vigour of Youth;

               <p>The Lungs are the firſt and chief
Inſtrument of Sanguification.</p>
               <p>The Chyle firſt mixeth with the
Blood, in the Subclavian Veins, and
enters with it into the Heart, where it
is very imperfectly mix'd, there being
no Mechaniſm nor Fermentation by
extraordinary Heat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to convert it
immediately into Blood, which is firſt
effected by the Lungs. The Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe
divides it ſelf into a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Branches call'd <hi>Bronchia,</hi>
theſe end in ſmall Air-Bladders dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and contractible, capable to be
inflated by the admiſſion of Air, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0412300600:57"/>
to ſubſide at the Expulſion of it.
The Pulmonary Artery and Vein paſs
along the ſurfaces of theſe Air-Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in an infinite number of Rami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.
A great number of thoſe
Air-Bladders form what we call Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buli,
which hang upon the Bronchia,
like bunches of Grapes upon a Stalk.
Theſe Lobuli conſtitute the Lobes,
and the Lobes the Lungs. Let us ſee
what effect an Engine ſo contriv'd
will have upon the crude mixture of
Blood and Chyle; firſt, as the Blood
and Chyle paſs through the Ramifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of the Pulmonary Artery,
they will be ſtill more perfectly mix'd,
a red Liquor, and a white Liquor
paſſing through only one Tube, will
both retain their Original Colours;
but if this Pipe is divided into
Branches, and theſe again ſubdivided,
the red and white Liquors, as they
paſs through the Ramifications, will
be more intimately mix'd, and both
Colours will be blended together;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0412300600:58"/>
the more Ramifications, the mixture
will be the more perfect; but this
is not all, for as this mixture of
Blood and Chyle paſſeth through the
Arterial Tube, it is preſs'd by two
contrary forces, that of the Heart
driving it forward againſt the ſides
of the Tube, and the elaſtick force
of the Air preſſing it on the oppoſite
ſide of thoſe Air-Bladders, along the
ſurface of which (as was ſaid before)
this Arterial Tube creeps. By thoſe
two oppoſite forces, the parts of the
Liquor are compreſs'd together, and
as it were churn'd, and more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
mix'd. Moreover by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate
motion of thoſe Air-Bladders,
whoſe ſurfaces are by turns freed
from mutual contact, and by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Subſidence meet again by the
ingreſs and egreſs of the Air; the
Liquor is ſtill further attenuated,
diſſolv'd, and chang'd into a homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous
Fluid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0412300600:59"/>
1. The force of the Air upon the
Pulmonary Artery is but ſmall, in
reſpect of that of the Heart, but it
is ſtill ſomething, and whatever the
effect of it be, it encreaſeth, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth
with the Gravity of the
Air, to which the Elaſticity is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional.</p>
               <p>As to the admittance of the
weighty and elaſtick parts of the Air
into the Blood, through the Coats
of the Veſſels, it ſeems contrary to
Experience. The ſpumous and florid
ſtate which the Blood acquires in
paſſing through the Lungs, is eaſily
accounted for, from its own Elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and the violent motion before
deſcrib'd: The Aerial Particles in the
Blood and Chyle expanding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
That the air in the Blood
Veſſels has a communication with
the outward Air, I think ſeems plain
from the Experiments of Human
Creatures being able to bear Air of
much greater Denſity in diving, and of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0412300600:60"/>
much leſs upon the tops of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
provided the Changes be made
gradually; otherwiſe the Air within
the Veſſels being of a leſs Denſity,
the outward Air would preſs their
ſides together, and being of a greater
Denſity, would expand them ſo as
to endanger the Life of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</p>
               <p>1. As much Blood paſſeth through
the Lungs, as through all the reſt of
the Body. The Circulation is quicker
and Heat greater, and their Texture
is extremely delicate; upon all which
Accounts they are extremely ſenſible
of any Force either from the too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Motion or Acrimony of the
Blood.</p>
               <p>2. Since the Lungs are the firſt
and chief Inſtrument of Sanguifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Animal that has that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
faulty, can never be duly nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd,
nor have the Vital Juices,
(which are all deriv'd from the Blood)
in a good State; and this is true, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0412300600:61"/>
the Lungs only as an
Inſtrument of Digeſtion, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting
from an Acrid and Purulent
Matter, that mixeth with the Blood
in ſuch as have their Lungs ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated;
therefore ſuch as have a faulty
Circulation through the Lungs, ought
to eat very little at a time, becauſe
the encreaſe of the quantity of freſh
Chyle muſt make that Circulation
ſtill more uneaſy, which indeed is the
caſe of Conſumptive, and ſome
Aſthmatick Perſons, and accounts
for the Symptoms they are troubled
with after eating. The great Rule
of Dyet for Conſumptive People, and
upon which the whole Cure depends,
is taking their Aliment in ſmall
Quantities. It happens very often
unfortunately for Aſthmatick Perſons
that they have Voracious Appetites,
and conſequently for want of a right
Sanguification are often Leucophleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0412300600:62"/>
3. The Choice as well as Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Dyet, is of great Importance
to ſuch as have weak Lungs, for it was
obſerv'd<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. I. Prop. VII. 5.</note> that the Chyle in the
Thoracick Duct retain'd the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Taſte of the Aliment, which
not being yet converted into Blood,
and intirely ſubdued by Circulation,
muſt operate upon the Lungs into
which it enters in this Condition,
according to its original qualities.
The Lungs being the chief Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Sanguification, and acting
ſtrongly upon the Chyle to bring it
to an Animal Fluid, muſt be reacted
upon as ſtrongly.</p>
               <p>4. Good Air aſſiſts the Digeſtion,
as it is an Inſtrument of Sanguifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Lungs.</p>

               <p>The Chyle is not perfectly aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milated
into Blood by its Circulation
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0412300600:63"/>
through the Lungs, for it is known
by Experiments of Blood-letting,
that ſeveral Parts of it remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd
with the Blood, ſwimming a

               <p>After the Chyle has paſs'd through

uſual Mechaniſm to convert it into
Animal Subſtances, during its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
with the Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately
mixing the Parts of the
Aliment; with theſe of the Animal
Juices, by the action of the ſolid Parts.</p>
               <p>The mixture of Blood and Chyle
after its Circulation through the
Lungs, being brought back into the
left Ventricle of the Heart is drove
again by the Heart into the Aorta,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0412300600:64"/>
through the whole Arterial Syſtem,
every Particle of the Body receives
ſome Branch from the Aorta, except
ſome of the ſolid Parts of the Liver.
The Arteries are Elaſtick Tubes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with a Contractile Force, by
which they ſqueeze, and drive the
Blood ſtill forward, it being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
from going backward by the
Valves of the Heart. The Arteries
are Conical Veſſels, with their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
towards the Heart, and as they
paſs on, their Diameters grow ſtill leſs
and leſs. The Celerity of the Motion
diminiſheth by the encreaſe of the
Friction of the Fluid, againſt the
ſides of the Tubes. Without this
Motion, both the Blood and the
Chyle, would be converted into one
ſolid Maſs, but on the contrary by
the continuance of it, the Fluid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compreſs'd by the ſides, of the
Tube; eſpecially in the ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
where the Points of Contact
are more; the Blood and Chyle are
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0412300600:65"/>
ſtill more intimately mix'd, and by
Attrition or Friction attenuated, by
which the mixture acquires a greater
Degree of Fluidity, and Similarity or
Homogenerety of Parts. Therefore,</p>
               <p>1. Good Blood and a due Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectile
Motion or Circulation, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to convert the Aliment into
laudible Animal Juices.</p>
               <p>2. The Strength of the Aliment
(by which I underſtand its Reſiſtance
to the ſolid Parts) ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd
to the Strength of the ſolid
parts, and as Animals that uſe a
great deal of Labour or Exerciſe,
have their ſolid Parts more elaſtick
and ſtrong, they can bear and ought
to have ſtronger Food, too thin Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
being quickly diſſipated by
the vigorous Action of the ſolid Parts.</p>
               <p>3. The Defects of the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
are not to be mended by
the ſecond; for if the Chyle paſſeth
into the Blood in a bad State, as the
force of Fibres, which contribute to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0412300600:66"/>
the ſecond Digeſtion is limited, it is
not ſufficient to convert a Peccant

call'd Serous Arteries. Thoſe Serous

Fluid compounded of the Ingredients

freely through ſuch Tubes?</p>
               <p>1. Hence one can eaſily perceive

Body demand a conſtant Reparation.</p>
               <p>An Animal in order to be
moveable muſt be flexible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is fitly made of ſeparate and
ſmall ſolid Parts replete with proper
Fluids. The whole Body is nothing
but a Syſtem of ſuch Canals, which
all communicate with one another,
mediately or immediately (for a Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick
Veſſel communicates with
the Artery, by the intermediate
Gland.) In this moveable Body the
fluid and ſolid Parts, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
by the Muſcular Motion, and
the perpetual Flux of the Liquids;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0412300600:69"/>
a great part of which are thrown

and the ſmaller Solids are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

Therefore both Fluids and Solids de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a conſtant Reparation.</p>
               <p>1. The Quantity of Solids not
Morbid in an Animal Body is very
ſmall, as appears by Atrophies, or
Decays; and likewiſe by Microſcopes,
thoſe Solids are entirely Nervous
and proceed from the Brain, and
Spinal Marrow, which by their bulk
appear ſufficient to furniſh all the

Parts. The Solids are originally form'd
of a Fluid, from a ſmall Point, as

differ, only in the degree of Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

turns a Fluid into a Solid. How
the Fluids are repair'd has been

               <p>The Fluids and Solids of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal

               <p>As the white of an Egg by Incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,

and more attenuated. A Fluid
moving through a flexible Canal,
when the Canal grows extremely
ſmall and ſlender, by its Friction,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0412300600:71"/>
will naturally lengthen, and as it
were Wire-draw, the Sides of the
Canal, according to the Direction
of its Axis, and as the Canal is leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd
or Wire-drawn, it grows ſtill
ſmaller and ſlenderer ſo as that the

the Extremities of theſe ſmall
Canals will by Propulſion be carried

likewiſe continually repair'd and new

ſmalleſt Particles which compoſe the
Fibres ſo as to leave vacant Interſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in thoſe Places where they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her'd
before, which vacant Places
will be again fill'd up by Particles
carried on by the ſucceeding Fluid
(as a Bank by the Mud of the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent)
and which of courſe muſt be

               <p>1. Thoſe Tubes that are moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently

Original, the more it grows.</p>

of the Fibres is owing the Union
or Conglutination of the Parts of the
Body, when they are ſeparated by a
Wound.</p>
               <p>4. From the foregoing Doctrine
it is eaſy to explain the Formation
of the moſt ſolid Parts of the Body,
for when the Fluid moves in ſeveral
ſmall Veſſels, which by the Contact
of their Sides ſtop the Current of
the Fluid thoſe Canals by degrees
are aboliſh'd and grow ſolid, ſeveral
of them united grow a Membrane,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0412300600:73"/>
theſe Membranes further conſolidated
become Cartilages, and Cartilages,
Bones; conſequently, an Animal the
nearer it is to its Original, the more
Pipes it hath, and as it advanceth in
Age ſtill the fewer. Many of our
Veſſels degenerate into Ligaments the
very Sutures of the Skull are aboliſh'd
in old Age.</p>
               <p>5. Many practical Rules may be
drawn from the foregoing Doctrine,
for the Diet of Human Creatures
according to their different States of
Life, and the Condition of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids,
it is evident that the Diet of
Infants ought to be extremely thin,
ſuch as lengthens the Fibres without
Rupture; but in a young Animal,
when the Solids are too Lax (the
Caſe of rickety Children) the Diet
ought to be gently Aſtringent.</p>
               <p>The Aliment likewiſe ought to be
different according to the State of
the Solids, in Animals full grown:
tho' an Animal arrives at its full
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0412300600:74"/>
Growth at a certain Age, perhaps it
never comes to its full Bulk, till the
laſt Period of Life. The <hi>Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
adipoſa</hi> inveſts almoſt every Part
of the Body, ſo that there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
any Fibre, but is ſheath'd with a
Part of it. This Membrane ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
an oily Liquor call'd Fat, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for many Purpoſes of Life;
when the Fibres are Lax, and the
Aliment too redundant, great part
of it is converted into this oily Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
all the ſuperfluous Weight of
an Animal beyond the Veſſels, Bones
and Muſcles is nothing but Fat; but
the Converſion of the Aliment into
Fat is not properly Nutrition, which
is a Reparation of the Solids and
Fluids, and Fat properly ſpeaking is
neither. But I ſhall treat more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
of theſe Subjects in their
proper Place.</p>
               <p>7. The Matter of Nutrition is
moſt ſubtile, and Nutrition the laſt
and moſt perfect Animal Action, to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0412300600:75"/>
perform it by the foregoing Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
there muſt be a due Degree
of projectile Motion, or Celerity of
Circulation to which Attrition and
Heat is proportional. The Heat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to Incubation, is only nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious;
any thing leſs or more is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient,
and the nutritious Juice it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
reſembles the White of an Egg,
in all its Qualities. By too weak a
Circulation the Aliment approacheth
to theſe Qualities which it would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
by a ſmall Degree of Heat
without Motion, is viſcous imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
mix'd, and the Perſon in this
Condition is ſubject to all the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of a <hi>Plethora,</hi> by too ſtrong a
projectile Motion the Aliment tends
to Putrefaction is diſſipated; and
the ſolid Parts inſtead of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd
are deſtroy'd. Hence may be
deduc'd the Force of Exerciſe in help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Digeſtion, and likewiſe the Rules
for regulating the Times and Degrees
of it. But thoſe are foreign to my

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0412300600:80"/>
more elaborated as it paſſeth into the

like the Chyle in an Animal Body,
not ſufficiently concocted by Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and is commonly ſubacid in
all Plants. This Juice is yielded in
great Plenty by Inciſion in ſome
Plants. The Juices of the Leaves are,
<hi>Firſt,</hi> That obtain'd by Expreſſion

The Juice of the Fruit is
ſtill the Juice of the Plant more ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated.
The Juice of the Seed is
an eſſential Oil or Balm deſign'd by
Nature to preſerve the Seed from
Corruption. The Bark contains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the common Juice, an oily
Juice which ſweats out of divers
Plants, when this Juice is in greater
Plenty than can be exhal'd by the Sun,
it renders the Plant ever Green. This
Oil farther inſpiſſated by Evaporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

is a peculiar Juice in each Species
not reduceable to Water, Oils, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam,
which may be call'd the Blood

                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0412300600:82"/>
1. Hence it follows, that he who
eats a whole raw Plant, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
Juice of it, takes in a greater
Variety of Subſtances, than he who
feeds on the ſame Plant prepar'd or
on ſome of the Parts of it, for all
Plants have the moſt of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
Ingredients, at leaſt in
ſmall Quantities.</p>
               <p>2. Vegetables differ from Foſſils,
and Animals in that being burnt to
Aſhes they yield a fix'd Alkaline Salt
which in thoſe of a ſharp Scent, as
Muſtard, Onions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is in a very
ſmall Quantity.</p>
               <p>3. The Effects of vegetable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
upon Human Bodies are more
Various than theſe of Animal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
and the Mechaniſm of
Plants ſeems to be more various than
that of Animals, for the, ſame Plant
produceth as great a variety of Juices
as there is in the ſame Animal, and
the different Plants a greater Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and yet the Aliment of Plants is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0412300600:83"/>
one uniform Juice; for from the
ſame Soil may be produc'd a great
variety of Plants, whereas different
Species of Animals live upon very
different ſorts of Subſtances; both
Mechaniſms are equally curious, from
one uniform Juice to extract all the
variety of vegetable Juices, or from
ſuch variety of Food to make a Fluid
very near uniform, the Blood of an
Animal.</p>
               <p>4. The ſpecifick Qualities of Plants
reſide in their native Spirit, Oil and
eſſential Salt; for the Water, fix'd
Salt and Earth appear to be the ſame
in all Plants.</p>
               <p>The Effects of the foremention'd
Ingredients of Plants are as follows,
Vegetable Salts are capable of reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the coagulated Humours of a
Human Body, and of attenuating,
by ſtimulating the Solids and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
the Fluids: Salts likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Secretions, Oils relax the Fibres,
are Lenient, Balſamick, and abate
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0412300600:84"/>
Acrimony in the Blood. It is by
Virtue of this Oil, that Vegetables
are nutrimental, for this Oil is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by Animal Digeſtion as an
Emulſion, and abounds moſt in
Plants of full Growth, and when the
Salts and Water are in leaſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
Aromatick Plants tho' they
abound with Oil, yet it is not ſoft
and nutritious, but as it is mix'd with
a Spirit, is too heating.</p>
               <p>The Volatile Salt and Spirit of
Vegetables is penetrating, heating
and active, contrary to the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Acids. The Balſams of Plants
contain a Volatile Salt, ſuch Balſams
when depriv'd of their Acids change
into Oils. Wax conſiſts of an acid
Spirit of a nauſeous Taſte, and an
Oil or Butter which appears white.
This Oil is Emollient, Laxative and
Anodyne.</p>
               <p>Honey is the moſt elaborate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the Vegetable Kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a moſt exquiſite vegetable Soap,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0412300600:85"/>
reſolvent of the Bile, Balſamick and
Pectoral. Honey contains no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable
Spirit before it has felt
the Force of Fermentation, for the
Diſtillation of it affords nothing that
will burn in the Fire.</p>
               <p>The Fruits of moſt Vegetables are
likewiſe Soaps, all Soaps (which are
a Mixture of Salt and Oil) are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating
and deobſtruent reſolving
viſcid Subſtances; for meer Water
diſſolves nothing but Salts: but as
the Subſtance of Coagulations is not
merely Saline, nothing diſſolves them
but what penetrates and relaxes at
the ſame time, that is a Soap or
a Mixture of Oil and Salt.</p>
               <p>6. Taſtes are the Indexes of the
different Qualities of Plants as well
as of all ſorts of Aliment: Different
Taſtes proceed from different Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Water, Earth, Oil and Salt,
but chiefly from the Oil and Spirit
mix'd with ſome Salt of a peculiar
Nature. A Muriatick or Briny Taſte
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0412300600:86"/>
ſeems to be produced by a Mixture
of an acid and alkaline Salt, for Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Salt and Salt Tartar mix'd, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a Salt like Sea Salt. Bitter and
acrid differ only by the ſharp Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the firſt, being involv'd in a
greater quantity of Oil than thoſe
of the laſt. Acid or ſowr proceeds
from a Salt of the ſame Nature With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Mixture of Oil; in auſtere
Taſtes the oily Parts have not diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
themſelves from the Salts, and
earthy Parts, ſuch is the Taſte of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe
Fruits. In ſweet Taſtes, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
Particles ſeem to be ſo atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated,
and diſſolv'd in the Oil, as
to produce only a ſmall and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Titillation. In oily Taſtes, the
Salts ſeem to be intirely diſentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled.</p>
               <p>Vegetables have very different Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
on Human Bodies as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
acid or alkaline Salts, and are
to be us'd according to the different
Conſtitution of the Body at that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0412300600:87"/>
time, as will appear by what will be
ſaid afterwards. All the Tetrapeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
ſiliquoſe Plants are Alkaleſcent.</p>

               <p>Mankind take as Aliment all the

Barley is Emollient, moiſtning
and expectorating. Oats have ſome
of the ſame qualities. Barley was
choſen by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> as proper Food
in inflammatory Diſtempers. Rice is
the Food of perhaps two thirds of
Mankind, it is moſt kindly and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign
to human Conſtitutions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for the Conſumptive, and ſuch
as are ſubject to Haemorages, next
to Rice is Wheat, the Bran of which
is highly Aceſcent and Stimulating.
Therefore the Bread that is not too
much purged from it is more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
for ſome Conſtitutions; Rye
is more Acid, Laxative and leſs
nouriſhing than Wheat; Millet is
diraetick, deterging and uſeful in
Diſeaſes of the Kidneys. Panick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
a ſoft Demulcent Nouriſhment
both for Granivorous Birds, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
Mays affords a very ſtrong

Beans reſemble them in moſt of their

Plants are highly aceſcent except Peaſe
and Beans.</p>
               <p>The mealy parts of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
Plants diſſolv'd in Water,
make too viſcid an Aliment to be

and making ſome of them into
Bread, which is the lighteſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt
Aliment for human Bodies,
Leaven by its Acid Salt, dividing the
Mucous and oily parts of the Meal.</p>
               <p>The next ſort of Subſtances which
Mankind feed on, are Fruits of Trees,
and Shrubs, theſe all contain Water
or Flegm, a great Quantity of Oil,
much elaborated, and an eſſential
Salt, upon the different mixtures of

theſe Ingredients, depend their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Qualities, by which they are
ſharp, ſweet, ſow'r or Styptick. Of
Fruits ſome are Pulpy, others contain'd
within a hard Shell, which laſt are
indeed the Seeds of the Plants, to
which they belong, and contain a
great deal of Oil, entangled with
Earthly Parts and Salts, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
make them hard of Digeſtion,
and paſs the Alimentary Duct un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolv'd.
There are other Fruits
which contain a great deal of cooling
viſcid Juice, combin'd with a Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Salt, which ſometimes makes
them offenſive to the Stomach; ſuch
are many of the low Pomiferous kind,
as Cucumbers, Pompions, tho' a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
thoſe, Melons when good,
have a rich Juice, and ſomewhat A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatick;
they are Diuretick, and
there are inſtances of their having
thrown People into bloody Urine.</p>
               <p>Of Alimentary Leaves, the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lera

Artichokes contain a rich Nutritious
Stimulating Juice.</p>
               <p>Of the Stems of Plants, ſome
contain a ſine Aperient Salt, and
are Diaretick and Saponaceous, as
Aſparagus which affects the Urine
with a Fetid Smell (eſpecially if cut

have been ſuſpected by ſome Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
as not friendly to the Kidneys,
when they are older and begin to

Of Alimentary Roots, ſome are
Pulpy, and very Nutritious, as Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neps,
Carrots, theſe have a fattening
Quality, which they manifeſt in feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Cattle. There are other Roots
which contain an Acrid Volatile Salt,
as Onions, Garlick, Leeks, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhes,
the mildeſt of theſe is Selery.
Thoſe ſorts of Roots are Alkaleſcent

caſes of Acidity. The Fungus kind,
as Muſhrooms, Truffles afford an
Alkaline Salt, and much Oil, ſome
of them being poiſonous make the
others ſuſpicious if taken in too great

               <p>There are many Vegetable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances

which abound with a highly

into which Vegetables re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
themſelves by the moſt ſimple O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
of Cookery and Chymiſtry.</p>
               <p>The Operations of Cookery
and Chymiſtry fall much ſhort of
the, vital force of an Animal. Body,
no Chymiſt can make Milk or Blood
of Graſs, yet it gives ſome light to
this Subject, to ſhow into what Parts
Vegetables reſolve themſelves by ſuch
Simple Operations, as barely ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
their Parts without confounding
or deſtroying them.</p>
               <p>The two Operations already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
<hi>viz.</hi> making an Emulſion
and Vegetable Putrefaction reſemble
Animal Digeſtion the moſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0412300600:94"/>
1. In making an Emulſion, the
oily Parts of Vegetables diſſolve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a white Liquor, reſembling Chyle.
Our Vegetable Food conſiſts of mealy
Seeds, Fruits, Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon which
the Teeth and Jaws act as the Peſtle
and Mortar, the Spittle, Bile, Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Juice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> art the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum
inſtead of the Water, which
the Chymiſt employs, the Stomach
and Inteſtines are the Preſs, and the
Lacteal Veſſels the Strainers, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
the pure Emulſion from its
Foeces. The Chyle is white, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of Salt, Oil, and Water of
our Food, much levigated or ſmooth.
This likewiſe conſtitutes the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Emulſions.</p>
               <p>2. Vegetable Putrefaction (by
what has been mention'd before)
turns Vegetable Subſtances into an
Animal Nature.</p>
               <p>3. Amongſt the Ingredients of
Vegetables that which conſtitutes the
moſt ſpiritous and fragrant part of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0412300600:95"/>
the Plant, is what paſſeth by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,
and exhales by the action
of the Sun. This is as it were the
preſiding Spirit of the Plant, from
which it draws its peculiar flavour,
and is the moſt active Principle in
the Vegetable. Thus every Plant has
its Atmoſphere, which have very
various effects on theſe who ſtay
near them, producing Head Achs,
Sleep, Fainting, Vapours; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
a great refreſhment of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
It is reported, that in <hi>Brazil</hi>
there are Trees which kill thoſe that
ſit under their ſhade in a few Hours.
This fragrant Spirit is obtain'd from
all Plants which are in the leaſt Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,
by a cold Still, with a heat
not exceeding that of Summer.</p>
               <p>4. If to a Plant you pour hot Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and let it ſtand a ſufficient time,
the Liquor ſtrain'd is call'd the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Plant, if the Plant be boil'd
in the ſame Water, the ſtrain'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
is call'd the Decoction of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0412300600:96"/>
Plant. The Infuſions and Decoctions
of Plants contain the moſt ſeparable
parts of the Plants, and convey not
only their Nutritious but Medicinal
Qualities into the Blood. This is
plain by many Experiments. The
Infuſion of <hi>Caſſia Fiſtularis</hi> makes the
Urine Green. The Infuſions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions
of Rhubarb, and Saffron
will in a quarter of an Hour tinge
the Urine with a high Yellow.</p>
               <p>5. The moſt oily parts are not
ſeparated by a ſlight Decoction, till
they are diſentangl'd from the Salts,
for if what remains of the Subject
after the Infuſion and Decoction, be
continu'd to be boil'd down with
the addition of freſh Water, a fat
ſapid odorous viſcous inflammable
frothy Water will conſtantly be found
floating a top of the boiling Liquor,
which being ſcumm'd off and gently
dry'd, will flame away in the Fire.
This Liquor is a kind of Soap conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
of the Oil and Salt of the Plant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0412300600:97"/>
6. Infuſions and ſlight De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions
contain more of the Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
Qualities of the Plant than theſe
which are more violent, for by a
ſtrong Decoction ſome part of the
Taſte and Smell fly off every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>7. The Infuſion and Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
prepar'd as before being evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
to a thicker Conſiſtence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſeveral Degrees of
Thickneſs paſſeth into a Jelly, Defru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
ſapa Rob extract which contain
all the virtues of the Infuſion or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
freed only from ſome of the
watery parts.</p>
               <p>8. The utmoſt force of boiling
Water is not able to deſtroy the
ſtructure of the tendereſt Plant. The
Lineaments of a White Lily will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
after the ſtrongeſt Decoction.</p>
               <p>9. The Extract obtain'd by the
former Operation burnt to Aſhes,
and thoſe Aſhes boil'd in Water, and
filtrated, yield a fiery Salt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0412300600:98"/>
10. The greater Quantity of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
Salt any Plant contains, which
is the caſe of the more pungent in
Taſte, and Odour, the leſs it affords
of this fixt Alkali: Thoſe fix'd Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaline
Salts do not preexiſt in the
ſame form in the Plant, for Acid
Plants as Sorel will afford by this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
an Alkaline Salt. Thoſe
Salts grow ſtill more fiery and
Alkaline by a greater degree of Heat.
Of all the Eſſential Salts of Plants,
that which is in moſt common uſe
in Aliment, is Sugar, which rather
diſſolves Flegm, than increaſeth it;
fot it grows tenacious only by long
boiling, it is a Sal Oleoſum, for
it is both ſoluble in Water, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
in Fire.</p>
               <p>11. Another manner of preparing
Vegetables is by expreſſing their
Juices. Thoſe expreſs'd Juices, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the true Eſſential Salt of the
Plant, for if they be boil'd into the
conſiſtence of a Syrup, and fet in a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0412300600:99"/>
cool place; the Eſſential Salt of the
Plant will ſhoot upon the ſides of
the Veſſels. Thoſe Eſſential Salts of
Plants differ according to the Plant
unto which they belong, but are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
into three Claſſes. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thoſe
of Acid Aſtringent, Auſtere Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables
as of unripe Fruits which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
the Tartar. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe
of ſucculent watery Plants, as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dive,
Cichory which afford a fine
nitrous kind of Salt ſoluble in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and very cooling. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thoſe
from oily Aromatick and odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Vegetables, which will hardly
afford any till their Oils be extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from them: feom hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that the expreſs'd Juices of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables
not filtrated very clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their whole Specifick Virtues.</p>
               <p>12. In the preparations of Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery
the moſt volatile parts of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables
are deſtroy'd; if any of them
are retain'd it is in Decoctions which
are made in Balneo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0412300600:100"/>
Decoctions, when we take the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
contain the Specifick Virtues
of the Plants, when we feed upon
the Plant it makes their ſolid parts
more tender, and deprives them of
a great deal of their more ſubtile
Oils.</p>
               <p>13. The vaſcular and ſolid parts
of Plants are incapable of any change
in the Animal Body, for the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of a ſtrong Decoction held over
a clear Fire will burn to Aſhes,
which is true Elementary Earth.
The fibrous and ſolid parts of Plants,
paſs unalter'd through the Inteſtines,
and ſometimes by ſticking there oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
great diſorders. Grains and
Nuts paſs often through Animals
unalter'd. The Excrements of Horſes
are nothing but Hay, and as ſuch
combuſtible.</p>
               <p>14. Vegetable Subſtances contain
a great deal of Air, which as they
are diſſolv'd in the Alimentary Duct
expands itſelf, producing all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
of Flatulency.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0412300600:101"/>
15. There are other Preparations
of Vegetables by Fermentation,
whereby they are wrought up into
ſpirituous Liquors, which may be call'd
by the general name of Wines. Such
fermented Liquors have quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
qualities from the Plant itſelf,
for no Fruit taken Crude has the
intoxicating Quality of Wine.</p>

            <head type="sub">Obſervations from the nature and moſt
ſimple Analyſis of Animal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</head>
            <p>AN Animal conſider'd in its
material part, cannot well be
defin'd from any particular origanical
part, which in ſome ſpecies are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in others are more than one,
nor from its locomotive Faculty;
for there are ſome which adhere to
Rocks, and other places. The. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtick
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0412300600:102"/>
of an Animal is to take
its Aliment by a voluntary action,
by ſome aperture of the Body,
which may be call'd a Mouth, and
to convey it into another call'd the
Inteſtines, into which its Roots are
implanted, whereby it draws its
Nouriſhment much after the manner
of Vegetables, only a Vegetable has
its Root planted without itſelf, and
an Animal its Root within its ſelf.
A Foetus in the Womb is indeed
nouriſh'd like a Plant, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by a Root planted within
itſelf, perhaps too an Animal may
be diſtinguiſh'd from a Vegetable in
that its Juices move through the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
by a projectile Motion.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>PROP. I.</head>
               <p>To give a ſhort account of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent
Parts of Animal Subſtances.</p>
               <p>An Animal conſiſts of ſolid and fluid
Parts, unleſs one ſhould reckon ſome
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0412300600:103"/>
of an intermediate nature as Fat and
Flegm.</p>
               <p>1. The ſolids ſèem to be Earth
bound together with ſome Oil, for
if a Bone be calcin'd ſo, as the leaſt
force will crumble it, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd
in Oil it will grow firm
again.</p>
               <p>The laſt Animal Solids are Earth
in its greateſt Simplicity, for the
Chymiſts make Veſſels of Animal
Subſtances calcin'd, which will not
vitrify in the Fire; for all Earth which
hath any Salt or Oil in it, will turn
to Glaſs.</p>
               <p>2. The Fluids of Animals are
more crude, and reſemble thoſe of
Vegetables, as they are nearer the
Root of the Animal. Thus Chyle
may be ſaid to be a, vegetable Juice
in the Stomach and Inteſtines, and
pour'd upon Blood it ſeems like Oil;
as it paſſeth into the Lacteals it
grows ſtill more Animal, and when
it has circulated often with the Blood,
it is entirely ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0412300600:104"/>
3. Blood is the moſt univerſal
Juice in an Animal Body, and from
which all the reſt are deriv'd, the red
part of it differs from the Serum, the
Serum from the Lymph, the Lymph
from the nervous Juice, and that
from the ſeveral other Humours that
are ſeparated in the Glands.</p>
               <p>4. Animal Subſtances differ from
Vegetable in two Things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> In
that being reduc'd to Aſhes they are
perfectly inſipid, all Animal Salts
being volatile, flying off with great
Heat. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In that there is no
ſincere Acid in any Animal Juice.</p>
               <p>5. And yet the Parts of the one
are tranſmutable into the nutritious
Juice of the other. An Animal can
nouriſh a Plant, and a Plant an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
by which it ſeems probable that
Vegetables have the Power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the alkaline Juices of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
into Acids. From the two
foremention'd Differences of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Animal Subſtances follows,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0412300600:105"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That all Animal Diet is alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcent,
or anti-acid. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That
Animal Subſtances containing no fixt
Salt, want the aſſiſtance of thoſe for
Digeſtion, which preſerve them both
within and without the Body from
Putrefaction.</p>
               <p>6. The conſtituent Parts of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
are, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Earth. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A
peculiar Spirit analogous to that of
Plants. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Water. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Salts.
<hi>Fifthly,</hi> Oil.</p>
               <p>7. The Earth as was before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
is ſincere, and immutable.</p>
               <p>8. The Spirit is an oily Subſtance
ſo attenuated as to become volatile.
This Spirit ſeems to be diſtinguiſh'd
in every Species, and Individual; a
Blood-Hound will follow the Tract
of the Perſon he purſues, and all
Hounds the particular Game they
have in Chaſe, and the Faculty by
which they diſtinguiſh particular Men
ſeems to be analogous to ours of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing
the different Species of
Vegetables by their Scent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0412300600:106"/>
9. Therefore, ſince the Animals
of the wild kind have their Scent,
and conſequently this preſiding Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
more high, it is probable that
their Juices are more exalted in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
               <p>10. Water is the chief Ingredient
in all the Animal Fluids and Solids;
for a dry Bone diſtill'd affords a great
quantity of inſipid Water. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Water ſeems to be proper Drink
for every ſort of Animal.</p>
               <p>11. The Juices of Animals con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of Water impregnated with Salts
of a peculiar Nature (excepting
Chyle which as was ſaid before may
be reputed a vegetable Juice, and
often contain Acids) Theſe Salts are
neither acid, nor perfectly volatile;
for in the Evaporation of Human
Blood by a gentle Fire the Salt will
not riſe, but only the Spirit, and
Water, not perfectly fix'd; for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Blood calcin'd yields no fix'd
Salt, nor is it a <hi>Sal Ammoniac;</hi> for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0412300600:107"/>
that remains immutable after repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Diſtillations; and Diſtillation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
the ammoniacal Quality of
Animal Salts, and turns them alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,
ſo that it is a Salt neither quite
fix'd, nor quite volatile, nor quite
acid, nor quite alkaline, nor quite
ammoniacal, but ſoft and benign,
approaching neareſt to the Nature of
a <hi>Sal Ammoniac.</hi> The elementary
Salts of Animals are not the ſame, as
they appear by Diſtillation; theſe
Alterations being made by Fire. Thoſe
Salts are of a peculiar benign mild
Nature in healthy Perſons who have
a vital Force to ſubdue all the ſapid
Subſtances which they feed upon, but
in ſuch who have not that vital Force,
or commit ſome Error in their Diet,
theſe Salts are not ſufficiently atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated,
and retain their original Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
which they diſcover in Cahe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xies,
Scurvies of ſeveral kinds and
other Diſtempers. The Cure of which
chiefly lies in the choice of Aliment
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0412300600:108"/>
with Qualities oppoſite to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of theſe Salts.</p>
               <p>12. Animal Oil is various accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Principles inherent in it, but
being freed from the Earth, Salts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
it is a ſimple unactive principle, and
the ſame in all Animals.</p>
               <p>13. Animal Subſtances are more
eaſily aſſimulated into Animal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
and therefore it ſeems pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that they are more nouriſhing
to Human Bodies than Vegetable.</p>
               <p>The Nature of Animal Food muſt
depend upon the Nature, Age, Diet,
and other Circumſtances of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
we feed upon.</p>
               <p>Animal Juices as well as Vegetable
are in their greateſt Perfection when
the Animal is full grown; young A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
participate of the Nature of
their tender Aliment, as Sucklings of
Milk.</p>
               <p>Animal Nouriſhment differs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably
as the Animal is terreſtrial,
amphibious, or aquatick. Fiſhes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0412300600:109"/>
more of Animal Salts and Oil,
for they corrupt ſooner than terreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trial
Animals, ſome Fiſhes as the
Thornback when dry'd, taſte of <hi>Sal
Ammoniac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The muſcular Fibres of Fiſhes are
generally more ſmall and tender than
thoſe of terreſtrial Animals, and their
whole Subſtance more watery. Some
Fiſhes as Whitings, can be almoſt
entirely diſſolv'd into Water.</p>
               <p>From which Qualities a Diet of
Fiſh is more rich and alkaleſccnt than
that of Fleſh, and therefore very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
for ſuch as practiſe Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
The Inhabitants of Sea-Port
Towns are generally prolifick.</p>
               <p>The Oils with which Fiſhes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
often turn rancid, and lie hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
on the Stomach, and effect the
very Sweat with a rancid Smell, which
is found to be true in ſome Places
where the Inhabitants live entirely
upon Fiſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0412300600:110"/>
Notwithſtanding the redundant
Oil in Fiſhes they do not increaſe
Fat ſo much as Fleſh, by reaſon of
their watery Quality.</p>
               <p>Water-Fowl abound with the ſame
rancid Oil as Fiſh.</p>
               <p>Fiſh being highly alkaleſcent, wants
to be qualified by Salt and Vinegar.</p>
               <p>14. Another Difference of the Fleſh
of Animals depends upon the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of their Food, from which it
is not hard to determine their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
conſider'd as Aliment. Thoſe
Animals that live upon other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
have their Fleſh and Juices more
alkaleſcent, than thoſe that live upon
Vegetables.</p>
               <p>15. The difference of the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Fleſh of the ſame Species,
depends upon the manner of living
of the Animal.</p>
               <p>Abſtracting from other Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
the moſt healthy Animal
affords the beſt Aliment, and the
caſtrated; than thoſe that are not ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0412300600:111"/>
An Animal that feeds itſelf takes
the moſt proper Food, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt
Quantities (if it has plenty
enough) has better Air, and more
Exerciſe, all which contribute to
make the Animal more healthy; for
theſe Reaſons <hi>Hippocrates</hi> commends
the Fleſh of the wild Sow above the
tame. The wild Kinds of Animals
having more Exerciſe, have their Jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
more elaborated and exalted; but
for the ſame Reaſon the Fibres are
harder, eſpecially when old. For this
Reaſon perhaps the Roe-Buck is the
fineſt of the Veniſon Kind. This
Rule in ſome meaſure holds true with
Fiſhes; Sea-Fiſh living in an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more agitated, and River-Fiſh
are better than thoſe in Ponds.</p>
               <p>Eels for want of Exerciſe are fat
and ſlimy, for this Reaſon perhaps
Fiſh without Fins and Scales were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the Fibres of fat Animals are
often more tender and moiſt than
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0412300600:112"/>
thoſe of lean, they are more coveted
by Mankind, and tame Fowls of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
themſelves as it were to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
ſeem to be their natural Food.</p>
               <p>16. The Juices of the ſame Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
in Decoctions are often more
nouriſhing, when the ſolid Parts are
not ſo good, and the Broth made
of grown Animals more nouriſhing
than that of young; for of the Parts
of the ſame Animal the muſcular
Fleſh with the nervous Parts, afford
the beſt Nouriſhment as containing
the moſt ſpirituous Parts. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the muſcular Fleſh taken
in Subſtance depends upon the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Tenderneſs, Moiſture or Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Fibres. The Glands dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
according to the particular Juices
which they ſeparate from the Blood.
Of all the Glands the Livers are the
moſt corruptible. Stall-fed Oxen
and cramm'd Fowls are often diſeas'd
in their Livers.</p>

and moſt ſimple Analyſis of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
Fluids and Solids.</p>
               <p>The propereſt Subjects for ſuch
an Enquiry are, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Fluid which
begins to receive an Animal Nature
without having perfectly attain'd to
it, and approaches neareſt to the
Nature of Chyle, <hi>viz.</hi> Milk. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
That which having attain'd
an Animal Nature by Circulation is
noxious if retain'd in the Animal; U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> An Animal Fluid no
ways excrementitious, mild, elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
and nutritious, and from which
every part of a perfect Animal can
be form'd; the White of an Egg.
<hi>Fourthly,</hi> The nutritious Juice of a
healthy Human Body which reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
the White of an Egg in moſt
of its Qualities. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Bones.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0412300600:114"/>
1. None of the Animal Fluids a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
mention'd, in a ſound State is
either acid or alkaline. <hi>Firſt,</hi> If to
any quantity of warm new Milk you
pour Oil of Tartar <hi>per deliquium,</hi> or
any other Alkali, no Efferveſcence
will follow, but the whole Body of
the Liquor will remain at reſt, though
it appear ſomewhat thinner. To
another Quantity of warm Milk pour
Spirit of Nitre, or any ſtrong Acid,
and again no Motion nor Ebullition
will appear, only the Milk preſently
after will become thicker than it was;
mix together the two Parcels of Milk,
upon which the Experiments were
made, and a great Efferveſcence will
immediately ariſe; from whence the
Propoſition is evident, that Milk is
neither an Acid nor Alkali, but when
there is an Acid and Alkali mix'd in
it, they manifeſt themſelves by their
Conflict: Milk doth not diſcover it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be Acid or Alkaline by Trials
with the Syrup of Violets.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0412300600:115"/>
The ſame Experiments hold in
two Parcels of the Urine of a heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Perſon before it has ſtood twelve
Hours.</p>
               <p>The ſame Experiments ſucceed on
two Parcels of a White of an Egg,
only it grows ſomewhat thicker up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mixing with an acid. The Serum
of the Blood ſtands the ſame Trials
of Acids and Alkalis.</p>
               <p>2. The Milks of ſeveral Animals
differ but very little as to their ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Qualities; Womens Milk is the
ſweeteſt, as to their nutritious Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
they ſeem to ſtand in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Order. That of Women,
Aſſes, Mares, Goats, Sheeps, Cows.
The Milk of Animals which make
hard Dung is moſt nouriſhing.</p>
               <p>3. Milk ſtanding ſome time, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
ſeparates into an oily Liquor,
call'd Cream, and a thinner, blue
and more ponderous Liquor, call'd
skimm'd Milk, neither of which Parts
is naturally acid or alkaline (but may
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0412300600:116"/>
turn ſo by ſtanding for ſome time)
nor in the leaſt acrimonious, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
let fall into the Eye they cauſe
no Pain or Senſation of Sharpneſs.
Milk is a kind of Emulſion, or white
Animal Liquor reſembling Chyle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
chiefly from Vegetables, and
after it has been mix'd with the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Juices of the Saliva, Bile, pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is eaſily ſeparated
from them again in the Breaſts.</p>
               <p>4. It differs from a vegetable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulſion
by coagulating into a curdy
Maſs with Acids, which Chyle and
vegetable Emulſions will not: Acids
mix'd with them precipitate a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaceous
chalky Matter, but not a
chyly Subſtance; for as was before
obſerv'd, if you pour Spirit of Nitre
into any Quantity of boiling new
Milk, and no Conflict or Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
will follow, but the Liquor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
itſelf into Curd and Whey,
which Whey turns ſpontaneouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid,
and the Curd will turn into
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0412300600:117"/>
Cheeſe as hard as a Stone; which
ſhows that the moſt ſolid Parts of
Animals may be made of Milk. The
ſame Effect of turning Milk into a
hard Curd, may happen in a Human
Body that abounds with Acids.</p>
               <p>5. Milk drawn from a ſound Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
fed on Vegetables, ſtanding in
a Heat equal to that of a Man in
Health, will ſoon ſeparate itſelf into
a Cream, and a more ſerous and
ponderous Liquor, which after twelve
Days attains to the higheſt Degree
of Acidity. But if the Milk be
drawn from ſome Animals that feed
only upon Fleſh, that have faſt'd
long, are feveriſh, or have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
hard Labour, it will be more
apt to turn rancid and putrify than
turn acid, acquiring firſt a ſaline
Taſte which is a Sign of Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and then it will turn into an
Ichor.</p>
               <p>6. If to a quantity of boiling
new Milk you add by Degrees any
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0412300600:118"/>
fix'd Alkali, as Salt of Tartar, or
Oil of Tartar <hi>per deliquium,</hi> there
will be a lighter <hi>Coagulum</hi> form'd than
by an acid. The Milk by boiling
will change into a yellow Colour,
and run through all the intermediate
Degrees, till it ſtops in an intenſe
red. The ſame thing happens by
the alkaline Powers of the Body; for
when an Animal that gives Suck
turns feveriſh, that is, its Juices more
alkaline, the Milk turns from its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
genuine Whiteneſs to Yellow;
to which the Suckling has an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
This was the Caſe (as the
learned <hi>Boerhaave</hi> tells us) of the
Cows of <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. If a Nurſe ſhould abſtain from
all acid Vegetables, from Wine,
Malt-Drink, and feed only on Fleſh,
and drink Water, her Milk inſtead
of turning ſour will turn putrid, and
ſmell like Urine. An alkaleſcent
Diet except that of Water is often
the Caſe of Nurſes in great Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0412300600:119"/>
Their Milk ſubjects the Child
to Fevers; on the other Hand the
Milk of poor People that feed upon
an Aceſcent Vegetable Diet, ſubjects
the Child to Diſeaſes, that depend
upon Acidity in the Bowels, as
Cholick: The Symptoms of ſuch a
Conſtitution are a ſour Smell in
the Faces, ſour Belchings, 'Diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the Bowels, and Paleneſs of
the Fleſh. The Cure of both Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
is effected by a change of Diet
in the Nurſe from Alkaleſcent to
Aceſcent or contrary ways as the caſe
requires. The beſt Diet for Nurſes is
a Mixture of both.</p>
               <p>It follows likewiſe from the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Obſervations, that no Nurſe ſhould
give Suck after twelve Hours faſting,
and that a tendency to Yellow, is an
early Sign of a Fever in the Nurſe.</p>
               <p>8. Recent Urine as it is neither
Acid, nor Alkaline, diſtill'd yields a
Limpid Water, neither Acid nor Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaline,
Saline nor Inflammable, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0412300600:120"/>
what remains at the Bottom of the
Retort is neither Acid nor Alkaline;
but being exhal'd by the Conſiſtence
of a Syrup, paſſeth through all the
degrees of Colours, Yellow, Red,
Brown and Black; and this ſoapy
Water being calcin'd affords ſome
Quantity of Sea Salt, but only in
the caſe of the Animal's taking Sea Salt
with its Food.</p>
               <p>9. Hence Sea Salt paſſeth unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
through all the Strainers of a
human Body, the moderate uſe of
it is very proper to preſerve Bodies
through which it paſſeth from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
it detergeth the Veſſels, and
keeps the Fluids from Putrefaction.
The Ancients gave the <hi>Sal Gemmoe</hi>
in putrid Fevers.</p>
               <p>All human Urine diſtill'd affords
a Water of a fetid Odour which
that of Animals fed on Vegetables
does not. The Urine of hard
Drinkers and feveriſh Perſons affords
a Liquor extremely fetid, but no
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0412300600:121"/>
Inflammable Spirit, what is Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
ſtays in the Blood, and affects
the Brain. Great Drinkers commonly
die Apoplectick.</p>
               <p>10. The Urine is a Lixivium of
the Salts that are in a human Body,
and the proper Mark of the State
and Quantity of ſuch Salts, and
therefore very certain Indications for
the choice of Diet may be taken
from the ſtate of Urine. Though
the Salts of human Urine be neither
Acid nor Alkaline, theſe Salts may
by the violent Motion of the Blood
be turn'd Alkaline, and even Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
and when they begin to turn ſo,
they affect the ſmall and tender Fibres
of the Brain more ſenſibly than other
Parts.</p>
               <p>11. Recent Urine diſtill'd with a
great Heat, and dry Sand will afford
a Volatile Alkaline Salt, and after
the ſame manner the Heat of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Body as it grows more intenſe
makes the Urine ſmell ſtill more
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0412300600:122"/>
ſtrong, and of a deeper Colour.
But as long as thoſe Alkaline Salts
are carried off by Urine, the Brain
and Nerves are leſs affected, but on
the contrary, when in a Fever theſe
Salts are left behind, that is when
the Urine turns pale, the Patient is
in danger.</p>
               <p>12. Recent Urine diſtill'd with a
fix'd Alkali is turn'd into an Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Nature, whence it ſeems proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that Alkaline Salts taken into a
human Body, have the power of
turning its benign Salts into fiery and
volatile, on which account they
ſeem improper in inflammatory Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers,
where the Salts are already
too much attenuated. <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
who found out this by Experience
order'd in ſuch a caſe Things of an
Acid Nature. In general a high co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd
Urine indicates an Acid cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Diet, for it is certain an Acid
or Alkaleſcent Diet makes a great
difference in the Salts of a human
Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0412300600:123"/>
13. The Rob or Sapa of Urine
diſtill'd with quick Lime affords a
ſiery, but not an Alkaline Spirit,
and Lime Water given inwardly in
the Caſe of a Diabetes, will bring
the Urine from Limpid Pale to be
of a higher Colour, which ſhows the
Power of a Lixivium of quick Lime
to unlock the Salts that are entangled
in the viſcid Juices of ſome ſcorbutic
Perſons.</p>
               <p>14. Recent Urine will likewiſe
cryſtalize by Inſpiſſation and afford
a Salt neither Acid nor Alkaline,
but of an active Nature, which may
be properly call'd the eſſential Salt
of a human Body. Urine becomes
Alkaline by Digeſtion in a heat not
greater than that of a human Body,
and throws off a ſtony Matter to the
Sides of the Veſſel.</p>
               <p>15. The Urine long detain'd in
the Bladder as well as a Glaſs will grow
red, fetid, cadaverous and alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.
The Caſe is the ſame with the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0412300600:124"/>
ſtagnant Water of Hydropical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
which at laſt produce a Drought
and feveriſh Heat.</p>
               <p>16. From hence very good Rules
may be drawn for the Diet of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phritick
and Dropſical Perſons, that
it ought to be ſuch as is oppoſite to
and ſubdueth the Alkaleſcent Nature
of the Salts in the Serum of their
Blood; thoſe manifeſt themſelves in
the Urine, which as was ſaid before
is the Lixivium of the whole Body.
Sal Ammoniac may likewiſe be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
from Urine, which is neareſt
to the Nature of an Animal Salt.</p>
               <p>17. The White of an Egg reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
the Nutritious Juice of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Body, from the White of an Egg
every part of a perfect Animal is
form'd, for during the Incubation of
the Hen, there is nothing of the Egg
conſum'd but the White.</p>
               <p>18. The White of an Egg is a
viſcous, unactive, inſipid, inodorous
Liquor capable of mixing with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0412300600:125"/>
and ſo mild that appply'd to the
moſt ſenſible part, the Eye, it cauſeth
no Pain.</p>
               <p>19. It is neither Acid nor Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,
for if the Juices of an Animal
Body were either, ſo as by the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the oppoſites, to cauſe an
Ebullition, they would burſt the
Veſſels.</p>
               <p>20. The White of an Egg gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
diſſolves by Heat, exceeding a
little the Heat of a human Body, a
greater degree of Heat will thicken it
into a white, opaque, dry, viſcous
Maſs, and this is the Caſe of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
of the Blood, upon which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Degrees of Heat produce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Effects.</p>
               <p>Attention ought to be had to this
Maxim in the Management of Diet,
Exerciſe and all outward and inward
Application to human Bodies and
warm Cataplaſms diſcuſs, but ſcalding
hot may confirm the Tumor. Heat in
general doth not reſolve and attenuate
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0412300600:126"/>
the Juices of a human Body, for too
great Heat will produce Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>21. Spirit of Wine mix'd cold
with the White of an Egg, coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
it as much as boil'd Water,
which ſhows that Spirit of Wine is
an immediate Styptick; ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
into the Veins it is ſudden
Death, and taken by the Mouth in
great Quantities is ſometimes ſudden,
but always certain Death. Spirituous
Liquors are ſo far from attenuating,
volatilizing and rendring perſpirable
the Animal Fluids, that it rather
condenſeth them and hardneth the
Solids, and therefore properly us'd
to hinder the growth of young Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
and this it will do by mere
external Friction; thereby coagulating
the Juices in the Extremities of the
Veſſels, hardening and aboliſhing the
Canals, and ſo increaſing their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
againſt the Force of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent
Liquid, which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0412300600:127"/>
ſtretch them. This plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates
the bad Effects of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
Spirits on human Bodies.</p>
               <p>22. The Water gain'd from the
White of an Egg by a gentle Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
is neither Acid nor Alkaline;
but by a ſtrong Diſtillation it affords
an Alkaline Spirit, Salt, two kinds of
Oil, and an Earth, which is another
inſtance of the Alterations great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Heat cauſe in Animal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
and hence we may conclude
that Volatile Salts never exiſt in
their own form, in an Animal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that the Heat requir'd to make
them Volatile endangers the life of
the Animal; hence a highly Alkaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Diet in hot Conſtitutions muſt
be hurtful,</p>
               <p>23. The White of an Egg will
putrify and turn Alkaline by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion,
a ſingle Grain of this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trify'd
Subſtance has operated like a
Poiſon, cauſing Vomiting and a Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
the Antidote of this Poiſon is ſome
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0412300600:128"/>
Acid Liquor, and ſuch are indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
when the Juices of a human
Body verge to Putrefaction. The
White of an Egg during Incubation
is diſſolv'd, but not properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
putrify'd, for in ſuch a State it
would be unfit for Nutrition.</p>
               <p>24. It ſeems probable that the
Bile in a human Body by ſtagnating
putrifies, cauſing a Cholera Morbus
in the firſt Paſſages, and a Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Diſtemper when it mixeth with
the Blood. In ſuch a ſtate of the
Bile, the Aliment ought to be thin
to dilute, demulcent to temper, or
acid to ſubdue and deſtroy an Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Acrimony.</p>
               <p>The Nutritious Juice of a healthy
Animal reſembles the White of an
Egg in moſt of its Qualities, but
this nutritious Juice being a ſubtile
Liquor, ſcarce obtainable from a
human Body, the Serum of the
Blood is fairly ſubſtituted in its
place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0412300600:129"/>
25. The Serum of the Blood
ſtands the foremention'd Trials, and
diſcovers itſelf to be neither Acid
nor Alkaline, only Oil of Vitriol
thickens and the Oil of Tartar thins
it a little.</p>
               <p>26. The Serum of the Blood di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
in a Heat not greater than
that of a human Body in health,
will gradually become thinner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to ſmell Cadaverous and putrify,
and at laſt, like the White of an Egg,
turn to an Alkaline Ichor, that fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with Acids, and committed
to Diſtillation affords like the White
of an Egg, an Alkaline Salt. This
ſhows the Effect of gentle Heat in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
Coagulations, for even the
Viſcous Matter which lies like Leather
upon the extravaſated Blood of Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritick
People may be diſſolv'd by a
due Degree of Heat.</p>
               <p>27. When the Blood ſtagnates in
any part of the Body, it firſt coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0412300600:130"/>
then reſolves, turns Alkaline,
Putrid and Corroſive.</p>
               <p>28. As the Serum of the Blood
is reſolvable by a ſmall Heat, a
greater Heat coagulates it ſo as to
turn it horny like Parchment, but
when it is throughly putrified it will
no longer concrete. The Blood of
ſome Perſons who have dy'd of the
Plague could not be made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete,
by reaſon of the Putrefaction
already begun.</p>
               <p>29. The Serum of Blood coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates
like the White of an Egg
with cold Spirit of Wine.</p>
               <p>30. The Serum of the Blood is
more Saline than the White of an
Egg, perhaps by the Salts taken in
Nouriſhment, and has ſomething of
a more fetid urinous Scent.</p>
               <p>31. The Serum of the Blood af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
by Diſtillation an exceeding
limpid Water, neither Acid nor Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaline,
which ſhows that the moſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0412300600:131"/>
ſubtile part of the Blood approacheth
nearer to Water than any other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
and that the Blood naturally
contains no volatile Salt.</p>
               <p>32. Theſe Experiments are to be
made on the Blood of healthy Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals:
It is poſſible in a lax and
weak habit of Body, where the Chyle
is not throughly aſſimilated by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
but floats on the Blood like
Oil, that ſuch a Serum might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
quite other Contents, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
even an inflammable Spirit,
by reaſon of the Vegetable Nature of
the Chyle.</p>
               <p>33. The Serum of the Blood by
a ſtrong Diſtillation affords a Spirit,
or Volatile Alkaline Salt, and two
kinds of Oil, and an Earth which
ſtill proves the Effect of Heat in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Bodies, in changing the benign
Salts into Alkaline.</p>
               <p>34. The Serum of the Blood is
attenuated by Circulation, ſo as to
paſs into the minuteſt Channels of an
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0412300600:132"/>
Animal Body, and become fit Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for it, but by the continual At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
and Heat of ſome of its Particles
becomes ſharp and offenſive to the
Body: Nature has provided the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
to diſcharge them. Hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
as by Prop. VIII. Chap. II.
the continual Neceſſity of a freſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit
of Chyle, which like an Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
dilutes the Serum, the Miſchiefs
ariſing from the Retention of Salts,
that ought to paſs by Urine, and
likewiſe the proper Indications for
cooling and diluting, in ſuch an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaleſcent
State of the Fluids.</p>
               <p>35. It appears by Experiments
made upon Bones, and other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Solids, that they conſiſt of the
ſame Principles with the Fluids, a
dry Bone diſtill'd affords a great
Quantity of inſipid Water, after the
Bones have undergone the Violence
of the Fire, the Aſhes afford no fixt
Salt, only ſometimes in Animals
that take Sea Salt, there will be a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0412300600:133"/>
very ſmall Proportion of that in the
Aſhes.</p>
               <p>36. The Animal Fluids and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids
are reſolvable into the ſame
Principles, and this is true not only
of the Fluids and Solids themſelves,
but likewiſe of all Preparations of
them. The Gellies made of the
Decoction of lean Fleſh, and Bones
in clear Water are reſolvable into
the ſame Principles as the Fleſh and
Bones themſelves, and if theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions
be repeated till the Water
comes off clear, the Remainder yields
no Salt by Diſtillation and little Oil;
therefore it is poſſible to extract the
whole Virtues of Animal Subſtances
by Decoctions, but the gentleſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the moſt volatile and fineſt
Parts after the Oil or Fat is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
               <p>37. Preparations by Cookery of
Fiſh or Fleſh ought to be made with
regard to rectifying their moſt noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and ſlimy Subſtances, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0412300600:134"/>
thoſe that are moſt Nutritious;
ſuch Preparations as retain the Oil
or Fat are moſt heavy to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
which makes bak'd Meat hard
of Digeſtion.</p>
               <p>38. By Experiments of the Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of different Subſtances with the
Serum of the Blood, it appears that
all Volatile Alkalis thin it, and Acids
coagulate it. I ſaid Volatile Alkalis
for the Serum being mix'd with an
equal Quantity of Oil of Tartar <hi>per

and an Alkaline Vapour ariſeth from
the Mixture; but the fame Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Spirit of Sal Ammoniac
makes the Serum thinner without
cauſing any Alteration in the Scent
or Colour.</p>
               <p>39. Spirit of Vitriol pour'd to
pure unmix'd Serum coagulates it
as if it had been boil'd. Spirit
of Sea Salt makes a perfect Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Serum likewiſe, but
with ſome different Phenomena from
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0412300600:135"/>
the former. The Spirit of Nitre pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
the ſame Effect.</p>
               <p>The Serum which is mix'd with
an Alkali being pour'd to that which
is mix'd with an Acid raiſeth an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcence,
at the Ceſſation of which
the Salts, of which the Acid was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
will be regenerated.</p>
               <p>40. Vinegar is an Acid of a very
peculiar Nature cooling and yet not
coagulating; for Spirit of Vinegar
gently dilutes the Serum of the Blood,
and even the Oil of Tartar being
pour'd to this Mixture cauſeth no
Efferveſcence; tho' <hi>Honiberg</hi> ſays, that
Spirit of Vinegar concentrated, and
reduc'd to its greateſt ſtrength will
coagulate the Serum.</p>
               <p>41. The Mixture of the Solutions
of Sea-Salt, Sal Gemmae, Borax Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
and Sal Ammoniac, cauſe no
change of Colour in the Serum; but
diſſolve its Texture a little, all except
that of the Borax. Glaubers Salt
maketh a ſtrong Coagulation of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0412300600:136"/>
Serum by reaſon of the Oil of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol
it contains.</p>
               <p>42. All ſaponaceous Subſtances,
which are a Mixture of Oil and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaline
Salt, thin the Blood without
cauſing any Efferveſcence; Spirit of
Harts-Horn given in great Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
will produce Hemorrhages,
which I have known by Experience,
and therefore is very improper in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Caſes. <hi>Boerhaave</hi> in his Chymiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
ſays, That <hi>Sal volatile oleoſum</hi>

of the Alcahol or rectify'd Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
it contains.</p>
               <p>43. The Tincture of Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
<hi>viz.</hi> a Preparation of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
rectify'd Spirit of Wine, and the
ſtrongeſt fix'd Alkali, preſerves the
Serum in a neutral State; for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Wine tends to coagulate, and
the Alkali on the contrary to diſſolve
it, whence it becomes neither thicker
nor thinner.</p>

Aliment is endued with the above

               <p>The Diſeaſes of Human Bodies
often require Subſtances of more
active Principles, than what are
found in common Aliment, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to produce ſudden Alterations:
But where ſuch Alterations are not
neceſſary, the ſame Effect may be
obtained by the repeated Force of
Diet, with more Safety to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
where the leſs ſudden Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are leſs dangerous. The ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
Activity of Aliment is compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated
by its Quantity, for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0412300600:139"/>
to the Laws of Motion, if the
Bulk and Activity of Aliment and
Medicines are in reciprocal Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Effect will be the ſame.</p>
               <p>1. All Bodies which by the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Faculties can be changed into
the Fluids and Solids of our Bodies
are call'd Aliment. But to take it
in the largeſt Senſe, by Aliment I
underſtand every thing which a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Creature takes in common Diet,
as Meat, Drink, and Seaſoning, as
Salt, Spice, Vinegar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It has been explain'd <hi>Prop.</hi> VII.
<hi>Chap.</hi> II. how the Aliment in moving
through the capillary Tubes at laſt,
as it were ſtagnates and unites itſelf
to the Veſſel or Tube through which
it flows. But in this Motion it will
act differently, both upon the Fluid
and Solid, according to its different
Nature. Every thing that acts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Fluids muſt at the ſame time
act upon the Solids, and contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,

               <head>PROP. III.</head>
               <p>To enumerate the different Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the Fluids and Solids of a
Human Body.</p>
               <p>There is a multitude of Words to
expreſs the various Alterations which
are produc'd in a Human Body by
Diet and Medicines, but as far as
relates to our preſent Subject, they
may be reduc'd to the following ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Heads.</p>
               <p>1. The Actions upon the Solids
are, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Stimulating or increaſing
their Vibrations or oſcillatory Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> Contracting, that is
diminiſhing their Length, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
their Thickneſs. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing
or making them more flexible
in their leſs coherent Parts. And
<hi>Laſtly,</hi> Conſtipating or ſhutting up
the Cavity of the capillary Tubes.</p>
               <p>2. The Actions upon the Fluids
are either changing their Qualities or
their Quantity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0412300600:141"/>
3. Their Qualities are chang'd by,
<hi>Firſt,</hi> Attenuating and condenſing, that
is diminiſhing or increaſing the Bulk
of their Particles. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them acrimonious or mild.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> By coagulating and diluting,
that is, making their Parts more or
leſs coherent. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By increaſing
or diminiſhing their Motion through
the Veſſels.</p>
               <p>4. The Quantity of the Fluids is
increas'd or diminiſh'd by the Increaſe
or Diminution of the Quantity of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment;
or by the ſuppreſſing or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
Animal Secretions.</p>
               <p>5. That all theſe Actions can be
perform'd by Aliment as well as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
is plain from Reaſon, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
and in ſome Caſes by ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Demonſtration, by obſerving the
Effects of different Subſtances upon
the Fluids and Solids of a Human
Body when the Veſſels are open, and
gape by a Wound or Sore. The Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of tepid Water and farmaceous
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0412300600:142"/>
Subſtances in relaxing; of Spirits, in
ſtopping Hemorrages, and conſolidat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Fibres; the Power of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaline
Abſorbents in ſubduing Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and of Oil in ſtopping Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
is well known to Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,
who are likewiſe well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Influence of Diet
upon the Wounds and Sores of their
Patients, and from the Condition of
the one, can gueſs at the Errors or
Regularity of the other. Acrid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
will break the Veſſels, and
produce an Ichor inſtead of laudable
Pus. The chief Intention of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery
as well as Medicine, is keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a juſt <hi>Equilibrium</hi> between the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent
Fluids, and vaſcular Solids,
when the Veſſels are too lax, and
don't ſufficiently reſiſt the Influx of
the Liquid, it begets a <hi>Fungus</hi> or
proud Fleſh; when the Balance is on
the other ſide, it produceth a Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice.
Were it not criminal to try
Experiments upon Patients, which
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0412300600:143"/>
they too often try upon themſelves,
I could anſwer that the Doctrine of
this Chapter would be verify'd by
Experience in Wounds and Sores, as
it is often perceptible even in an
Iſſue.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="part">
               <head>PROP. IV.</head>
               <p>To explain the Effects of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
alimentary Subſtances upon the
Fluids and Solids of a Human Body.</p>
               <p>1. The firſt ſort of Alimentary
Subſtances are ſuch as are of ſo mild
a Nature, that they act with ſmall
Force upon the Solids, and as the
Action and Re-action are equal, the
ſmalleſt Degree of Force in the Solids
digeſts and aſſimilates them; of ſuch
ſort is Milk and Broths made of the
muſcular Parts of Animals, which are
as it were already prepar'd, and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
converted into Animal Subſtances;
theſe are proper. Nouriſhment for
weak Bodies, and agree perfectly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0412300600:144"/>
well with them, unleſs there be ſome
particular Acrimony in the Stomach,
which ſometimes makes them offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
and which Cuſtom at laſt will
overcome.</p>
               <p>2. Thoſe Things which ſtimulate
the Solids, produce the greateſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
in an Animal Body. This
is ſeen in many Inſtances. Violent
Sneezing produceth Convulſions in
all the Muſcles of Reſpiration, and
an univerſal Secretion of all the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
Tears, Spittle, Sweat, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> So great an Alteration can
be produc'd only by the Tickling of
a Feather, and if the Action of
Sneezing ſhould be continu'd by ſome
very acrid Subſtance, it will at laſt
produce Head-ach, Vomiting, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Convulſions, Fever and Death,
Therefore ſuch active Subſtances as
taken inwardly in ſmall Quantities
make great Alterations in the Fluids,
muſt produce this Effect by their ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating
Quality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0412300600:145"/>
3. Acrid Subſtances, which are
ſmall enough to paſs into the capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
Tubes, muſt ſtimulate the ſmall
Fibres, and irritate them into greater
Contraction, and ſtronger Vibrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>4. Many things which we take
as Aliment, or with our Aliment
have this Quality in ſome degree:
As the Juices of acid Vegetables,
fermented Liquors, eſpecially ſharp
Wines, fermented Spirits, aromatical
Vegetables as Fennel, Savory, Thyme,
Garlick, Onions, Leeks, Muſtard,
which abound with a volatile pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Salt, all Spices, in general all
Vegetables, which being corrupted
eaſily reſolve themſelves into a fetid
oily Alkali. Onions, Garlick, Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
Salt, and Vinegar taken in great
Quantities by their <hi>Stimulus,</hi> excite
a momentary Heat and Fever, and
therefore in ſome Caſes to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
afterwards are very proper.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0412300600:146"/>
5. The ſolid Parts may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
various Ways. <hi>Firſt,</hi> By diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
their Continuity, for when
a Fibre is cut through, it contracts
itſelf at both Ends; therefore all
Things which are ſo acrimonious as
to deſtroy the ſmall Fibres muſt
contract them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whatever
makes a Depletion of the Veſſels
gives room to the Fibres to contract;
therefore Abſtinence produceth this
Effect in the beſt Manner. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſhortens the Fibres, by inſinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
itſelf into their Parts, as Water
in a Rope, contracts; fermented
Spirits poſſeſs their Quality in a great
Degree.</p>
               <p>6. The more oily any Spirit is,
the more pernicious, becauſe it is
harder to be eluted by the Blood.
Brandy is more eaſy to be ſo, than
Spirit of Juniper, and that than Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Aniſeſeed. Compound aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Spirits deſtroy, <hi>Firſt,</hi> By
their fermentative Heat. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0412300600:147"/>
their oily Tenacity. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By a
cauſtick Quality reſiding in Spices
apt to deſtroy the ſolid Parts, but
theſe Qualities render them proper
in ſome Caſes taken in ſmall Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities.</p>
               <p>7. Fermented Spirits contract,
harden and conſolidate many Fibres
together, aboliſhing many Canals, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
where the Fibres are the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt
as in the Brain, by which Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
they deſtroy the Memory and
intellectual Faculties.</p>
               <p>8. Acid auſtere Vegetables have
this Faculty of Contracting and
ſtrengthning the Fibres without ſome
of the bad Effects of fermented Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
as all Kinds of Sorrel (the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of which lie in an acid aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Salt, a ſovereign Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the putreſcent bilious Alkali)
ſeveral Kinds of Fruits, as Quinces,
ſome ſorts of Pears with the Marma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lades
made of them, Medlars, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
Barberries, Pomegranates, Purſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0412300600:148"/>
ſuch are eaſily diſtinguiſh'd by
a rough ſtyptick Taſte. Amongſt
Drinks Auſtere Wines, unripe Fruits
likewiſe have the ſame Quality, but
are apt to obſtruct the Nerves, and
occaſion Palſies.</p>
               <p>9. Relaxing the Fibres is making
them flexible, or eaſy to be leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd
without Rupture, which is done
only in the capillary vaſcular Solids.
Amongſt Liquids endued with this
Quality of relaxing, warm Water
ſtands firſt, next watery Decoctions
of farinaceous Vegetables, or Grains,
as Oats, Barley, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All ſweet and
mild Garden-fruits, almoſt all Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Herbs,
Spinage, Betes, Cabbage, Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worts,
and all that Tribe. Red Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage
beſides is reckon'd a good Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral;
ſome of the lacteſcent and
papeſcent Plants, as Lettuce, Cicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
whoſe Milk is anodyne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent,
therefore good in Diſeaſes
of the Liver; but all ſuch Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
muſt be unfermented, for Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0412300600:149"/>
changes their Nature. Oils
expreſs'd from mild Plants, Animal
Oils, Cream, Butter, Marrow, which
laſt is of all oily Subſtances the moſt
penetrating.</p>
               <p>10. It is not probable that any
thing which Human Creatures take
as Aliment, ſhould have the Quality
of entirely conſtipating or ſhutting
up the capillary Veſſels, becauſe ſuch
Subſtances could hardly enter the
Lacteals, and if they did, would ſtop
the Circulation in the Lungs, but all
viſcid Aliment ſuch as is made of
farinaceous Subſtances unſermented,
neither paſs the Lacteals, nor circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
ſo eaſily as the ſame Subſtances
fermented. Some of the <hi>Fungus</hi> Kind
gather'd by miſtake for edible Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms,
have produced a Difficulty
of Breathing.</p>
               <p>11. The Qualities of the Fluids
can be likewiſe chang'd by Diet, as
<hi>Firſt,</hi> By attenuating or diminiſhing
the Coheſion of the Parts of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0412300600:150"/>
Fluid. The Coheſion of the Parts
depends upon the Weight and Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
therefore Abſtinence and a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Diet attenuates, becauſe Deple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Veſſels gives room to the
Fluid to expand itſelf.</p>
               <p>12. Whatever penetrates and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes
at the ſame time; therefore
Water impregnated with ſome pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
Salt, attenuates moſt ſtrongly;
Water with <hi>Sal Ammoniac</hi> will paſs
through a Human Skin. To this
Quality may be juſtly aſcrib'd the
great Effects of medicated Waters,
all ſtimulating Subſtances by increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Motion of the Blood atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate,
unleſs they increaſe the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſo much, as at laſt to produce
Coagulation.</p>
               <p>13. Thickening the Blood is moſt
eaſily brought about by exhaling the
moſt liquid Parts by ſudoriſick or
watery Evaporations; but this brings
it into a morbid State. Acid auſtere
Vegetables before mention'd, have
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0412300600:151"/>
this Quality of condenſing the
Fluids, as well as ſtrengthning the
Solids.</p>
               <p>14. The Blood of labouring Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is more denſe and heavy than of
thoſe who live a ſedentary life, and
the Diſeaſes which People imagine
proceed from the Thickneſs of Blood,
come often from the contrary Cauſe;
too thin Blood ſtrays into the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſubordinate Veſſels which
are deſtin'd to carry Humours ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the Blood, according to
what was ſaid Prop. V. Chap. II.
This cauſes an Obſtruction falſly
aſcrib'd to the Thickneſs of the Blood.</p>
               <p>The Qualities of Blood in a healthy
State are to be florid when let out
of the Veſſel, the red Part congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtrongly and ſoon together in a
Maſs moderately tenaceous,ſwimming
in the Serum, which ought to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any very yellow or greeniſh caſt.
The Gravity of Blood to Sea-Water
is as 26 is to 25, that of the Serum to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0412300600:152"/>
the ſame Water, as 300 to 353, it's
an eaſy matter to examine extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated
Blood by theſe Marks.</p>
               <p>15. Acrimony is not Natural, but
induc'd into the Fluids of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Body. Acrimony may be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by Diet, that is either Muria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
(Briny) or Acid, which likewiſe
is of two ſorts, of things naturally
Acid; or (made ſo by Fermentation)
Aromatick, conſiſting of Salts, and
highly exalted Oils, intimately uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Or <hi>Secondly,</hi> by increaſing the
Velocity of the Blood, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Attrition of the Parts.</p>
               <p>16. Acrimony in the Blood it ſelf
is commonly of three Sorts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Nature of the Salts in
which it reſides. Acid, Alkaline or
Muriatick as in the Sea Scurvy, but
the laſt approaches more towards the
Alkaline, and admits of the ſame
Cure: Acid Acrimony reſides chiefly
in the firſt Paſſages, proceeding often
from the Weakneſs of Digeſtion, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0412300600:153"/>
the too long Duration of Vegetables,
and Milk in the Stomach. Animal
Subſtanccs are all Alkaleſcent, of
Vegetable Subſtances ſome are Acid,
others Alkaleſcent, and each Sort is
to be uſed according to the two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Intentions.</p>
               <p>17. Antiacid Vegetables are, <hi>Firſt,</hi>
All kinds of Garlick, Onions, Leeks,
and Selery, the Actiſcorbutick
Plants, Carrots, Turnips, Eringo
Roots, Aſparagus, Horſe-radiſh, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard,
Cabbage. <hi>Secondly,</hi> All Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Subſtances eſpecially of ſuch as
live on other Animals; the Juices
of which are more Alkaleſcent than
of the Animals which live upon
Vegetables, ſuch are moſt Fiſhes, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
ſome of the Teſtaceous kind.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> Water as it dilutes and ſubdues
Acidity. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Oils are Antia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids
ſo far as they blunt Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
but as ſome times they
are hard of Digeſtion they produce
Acrimony of another Sort.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0412300600:154"/>
18. On the other Hand when the
Acrimony is Alkaline, which is more
frequently the Caſe in the circulating
Juices. The proper Diet is Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Farinaceous Vegetables which
ſeem appointed by Nature, for the
Vegetable Diet of human Creatures.
This Alkaline Acrimony indicates
the copious uſe of Vinegar, and
Acid Fruits, as Oranges, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Juice moſt effectual in the
Cure of the Muriatick Scurvy of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners;
the Juice of Lemons is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
more proper and more cooling
and aſtringent than that of Oranges.
In this caſe all the mild Antiſcorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
are indicated as Sorrel, Cichory,
Lettuce, Apples, and of Liquids
Whey: On the contrary all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crid
Antiſcorbuticks, as Scurvygraſs,
Horſeradiſhes, Muſtard, &amp;c. are hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in this hot Scurvy.</p>
               <p>19. There is a third ſort of
Antiſcorbuticks proper in this Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcent
State of the Fluids, which
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0412300600:155"/>
is call'd Aſtringent, ſuch as Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates,
Capers, and moſt of the
common Pickles prepar'd with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.
The Extremity of Alkali is
Putrefaction. All Acid Subſtances,
and Sea Salt reſiſt Putrefaction, but
as it is a ſharp ſolid Body unalterable
in an Animal Body, when it is taken
in too great Quantities in a conſtant
Diet of Salt Meat, it breaks the
Veſſels, produceth Eroſions of the
ſolid Parts, and all the Symptoms of
the Sea-Scurvy, which is to be cured
by Acid Vegetables, and not by hot
Antiſcorbutick; all Spices likewiſe
induce this Acrimony, as was hinted
before.</p>
               <p>20. There are other Subſtances
which are oppoſite to both Sorts of
Acrimony which are call'd demul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
or mild, becauſe they blunt or
ſheath theſe ſharp Salts, as Farinaceous
Legumes, ſuch as Peaſe, Beans, Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils.
Native Oils of Animals, as
Cream, Butter, Marrow, which laſt
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0412300600:156"/>
is a Specifick in that Scurvy which
occaſions a Crackling of the Bones,
in which caſe Marrow performs its
natural Function of moiſtening them.
All Plants which are without Smell
or pungent Taſte are demulcent, as
likewiſe all the Alimentary Parts of
ſound Animals, for none of their
Juices will hurt the Eye or a freſh
Wound. Acrimony which is not
viſcid may be cur'd by Diet, but Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity
requires more active Subſtances
to diſſolve it.</p>
               <p>21. Whatever renders the motion
of the Blood more languid than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
diſpoſeth to an Acid Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
What accelerates the Motion of
the Blood beyond what is natural
diſpoſeth to an Alkaline Acrimony.</p>
               <p>22. The next Alteration which
is made in the Fluids is rendering it
more thin, which is perform'd by
Diluting, there is no real Diluent but
Water, every Fluid is diluent as it
contains Water in it. Water dilutes,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0412300600:157"/>
but at the ſame time relaxeth, this
laſt Quality is taken off by mixing
ſome Acid Juice with it: Water
mix'd with Acids reſiſts the Heat
and Alkaleſcent State of the Fluids,
as long as there is Thirſt, a quick
Pulſe, Dryneſs, with a free Paſſage by
Urine, and Stricture of the Veſſels, ſo
long is Water ſafely taken.</p>
               <p>23. Oppoſite to Dilution is Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulation
or Thickening, which is
perform'd by diſſipating the moſt
liquid Parts by Heat, or by inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating
ſome Subſtances which make
the Parts of the Fluid cohere more
ſtrongly. All Vegetables which make
a black Tincture with the Vitriol of
Steel have this Quality, they have
commonly a rough ſtyptick Taſte:
Vinegar as was ſaid before is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
very particular, for it doth not
coagulate: Inflammable Spirits co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulate
the Fluids, and harden the
Solids in a ſtrong Degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0412300600:158"/>
24. Reſolving what is congeal'd
is turning it into a Fluid again; this
can be perform'd by watery Liquors,
impregnated with ſome penetrating
Salt, but more effectually by ſapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naceous
Subſtances compos'd of Oil
and Salt, ſuch are Honey, and the
Robs and Gellies of moſt Fruits.
Vinegar and Honey mix'd is a ſtrong
reſolvent. Spiſſitude is ſubdu'd by
Acrid things, and Acrimony by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſſitating.</p>
               <p>25. The ſecond Manner of Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
upon the Fluids is by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
or diminiſhing their Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
the firſt is perform'd by a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Diet, and the Suppreſſion of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations,
the ſecond either by a
ſpare Diet or promoting the Animal
Secretions, that is expelling the
Fluids out of the Body. Tho' Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the laudable Juices are beſt
accompliſh'd by increaſing the Fluids.</p>
               <p>26. Whatever generates a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of good Chyle, muſt likewiſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0412300600:159"/>
generate Milk, ſuch is new Milk
ſeaſon'd with Sugar or Salt. This
will increaſe the Milk when it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd
by the too great uſe of
Fleſh Meat: Gruels made of Grains,
Broths, Malt Drink not much
hopp'd, Poſſet Drinks, and in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
whatever relaxeth, have the ſame
Effect.</p>
               <p>27. There are as many good
Pectorals of the Alimentary, as of
the Medicinal kind, as all Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Barley, Oats, Honey, all
Saponaceous Subſtances before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
which attenuate Flegm.</p>
               <p>28. There is Aliment lenitive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
the faeces without ſtimulating
the Bowels, ſuch are Anim al Oils
quite freſh (for by ſtanding they
grow Acrid) as Cream, Butter, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
Broths made of the Parts of
Animals about the Meſentery, Oils
expreſs'd from ripe Fruits (from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe
they are auſtere and aſtringent)
the Juices of mild and ripe Fruits,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0412300600:160"/>
Decoctions of farinaceous Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
natural Soaps as Honey, Sugar,
ſuch Diet is proper for the hot Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of warm Countries, where
ſtrong Perſpiration exhales the Moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Water, Milk, Whey, taken in
the open Air without much exerciſe
ſo as to make them perſpire, relax
the Belly.</p>
               <p>29. There are Aliments which
beſides this lubricating Quality, ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate
in a ſmall Degree. Gellies
made of the ſolid parts of Animals,
as of their Horns, ſtimulate by the
Salts that are in them. Salted Fleſh
which often throws Ships-crews into
Fluxes, Shell Fiſhes which have a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Taſte, Garden Fruits which have
any Acrimony, moſt ſorts of Berries,
ſome of which will produce Diarrhoeas,
warm Water mix'd with Honey,
and Honey mix'd with Acids diſſolve
Flegm in the Bowels. There are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which promote the Secretion of
Bile, ſuch as all natural Soaps, the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0412300600:161"/>
Juices of Fruits ſharp, and ſweet, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
Grapes, the immoderate uſe
of which will produce a Cholera Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</p>
               <p>30. Diureticks are Decoctions,
Emulſions and Oils of Emollient
Vegetables, in ſo far as they relax
the Urinary Paſſages: Such as relax
ought to be try'd before ſuch as force
and ſtimulate. Thoſe Emollients
ought to be taken in open Air to
hinder them from perſpiring, and on
empty Stomachs. Vegetables which
abound with eſſential Salt, are Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
by ſtimulating, as Sorrel,
Chervil, Parſly, Eringo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
likewiſe all ſuch as contain an Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Balſam as Aſparagus, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>31. As to Sudorificks, it ought
to be conſider'd that the Liquid which
goes off by Sweat, is often the moſt
ſubtile part of the Blood, and ought
not to be forc'd away without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifect
neceſſity. The Matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0412300600:162"/>
Perſpiration is mild, that of
Sweat reſembles Urine, and yields a
Volatile Salt, oily and fetid. When
Sweat is vehement it will grow Bloody.
The Matter of Sweat is the watery
part of our Drink impregnated with
this Salt, ſometimes in weak and
conſumptive People, Crude, Chyle,
and ſometimes (as was ſaid before)
the moſt elaborate ſubtile part of
our Blood, as in fat People who
have a ſmall inſenſible Perſpiration.</p>
               <p>32. Sweat is produc'd by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the balance between the Fluids
and Solids (in which it muſt be
confeſt that true Health conſiſts) ſo
as the projectile Motion of the
Fluids overcome the Reſiſtance of
the Solids; therefore it is produc'd
by relaxing the Paſſages of the Skin.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> By diluting. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By
diſſolving the Blood. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By
accelerating its Motion. Water dilutes
and relaxes at the ſame time, therefore
the beſt and ſafeſt Sudorifick, watery
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0412300600:163"/>
and Acid things mix'd prove ſtrong
Sudorificks; Spices by Heating, and
diſſolving the Blood are not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and ſafe Sudorificks.</p>
               <p>33. Inſenſible Perſpiration is the
laſt and mod perfect Action of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
Digeſtion; the keeping it up
in due meaſure, is the cauſe as well
as ſign of Health, and the leaſt
Deviation from that due Quantity,
the certain forerunner of a Diſeaſe,
therefore the beſt Indications for Diet
are taken from the Meaſure of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</p>
               <p>The Food which is moſt Vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
and Perſpirable is certainly the
moſt eaſily digeſted, but ſuch may
be proper or improper, for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
according to its Circumſtances,
eſpecially the Quantity of its Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Motion. By Prop. IV. Chap. II.
The ſtrength of the Aliment muſt
be proportion'd to the action of the
Solids upon it, which in an Animal
under a courſe of exerciſe or hard
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0412300600:164"/>
labour is much ſtronger; therefore
Aliment too Vaporoſe or Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
will ſubject it to the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
of too ſtrong a Perſpiration,
which are Debility, Faintings, and
ſometimes ſudden Death. What di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth
Sweating, or the ſenſible
Perſpiration increaſeth the inſenſible,
for that reaſon a Strengthning and
Aſtringent Diet often conduceth to
this purpoſe. According to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
of <hi>Sanctorius</hi> the moſt
nouriſhing Aliment is the leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirable
except Mutton, which of
all others is moſt ſo, and Hog's
Fleſh the leaſt; and for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
Eels, and all very fat and oily
Subſtances: copious Food of ſmall
Nouriſhment perſpires much.</p>
               <p>A Stomach too void or too full
ſtops Perſpiration. The Fruits of the
low Pomiferous Plants as Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
Melons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſtop Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
therefore they are wiſely provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Nature in a Seaſon when the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0412300600:165"/>
Perſpiration is too great. Variety of
Meats diminiſh Perſpiration, Honey
in cold Conſtitutions increaſeth Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,
except when it promotes
too great a Secretion of the Bile,
and then it diminiſheth it: Drinking
exceſſively during the time of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification,
ſtops Perſpiration. Let
thoſe who ſit long at their Bottle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Meals conſider this.</p>
               <p>The moſt ſure ſign of a deficient
Perſpiration is Flatulency or Wind.</p>
               <p>34. The Menſes are promoted.
<hi>Firſt,</hi> By every thing which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
a Plethora, ſuch are all Aliments
of eaſy Digeſtion, taken in ſufficient
Quantity. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By all Sapona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous
Subſtances, which incide the
Mucus in the firſt Paſſages. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
By Spices and warm Vegetables
which abound with a Volatile oily
Salt. Of theſe we have ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>35. Heat in Animal Bodies is
produc'd by the Attrition of the Fluids
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0412300600:166"/>
and Solids, for when that ceaſeth as
in Death, there is extremity of Cold,
The ſolid parts of Animals rubbing
againſt one another would in time
produce a Heat capable to deſtroy
the Parts, had not Nature provided
an oily Subſtance to lubricate and
moiſten them; when that fails as
happens ſometimes in the Scurvy,
Gout, and Rheumatiſm, an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory
Heat is often produc'd.</p>
               <p>36. Stimulating Subſtances taken
in Diet increaſe Heat, becauſe they
increaſe the Oſcillatory Motion of
the Solids, but moſt of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory
Spirits. Whatever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth
the Denſity of the Blood,
even without increaſing its Celerity,
heats, becauſe a denſer Body is hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than a rarer. Extreme Cold at laſt
heats. Cold in Animal Bodies is
produc'd by Cauſes contrary to thoſe
productive of Heat, as <hi>Firſt,</hi> by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing
the force of any Stimulus,
as by Whey, Milk, Water, <hi>&amp;c.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0412300600:167"/>
Secondly,</hi> By all Things which relax.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> Alkaline Subſtances in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Acid, and Acid in reſpect
of Alkaline are cooling.</p>
               <p>37. Cephalick are all ſuch Things
as attenuate the Blood ſo as to make
it circulate eaſily through the capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
Veſſels of the Brain. A Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
properly ſpeaking is not always
what increaſeth the Force of the
Heart; for by increaſing that the
Animal may be weaken'd as in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory
Diſeaſes. Whatever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth
the Natural or Animal
Strength, the Force of moving the
Fluids and the Muſcles is a Cordial,
ſuch are ſuch Subſtances, as bring
the Serum of the Blood into the
propereſt Condition for Circulation
and Nutrition, as Broths made of
Animal Subſtances, Milk, ripe Fruits,
and whatever is endued with a
wholeſome but not pungent Taſte.
Whatever relaxes the too ſtrict, or
ſtrengthens the too lax Fibres, what
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0412300600:168"/>
in ſome Caſes diſpels Wind, what
excites and takes off the ſluggiſh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Animal Spirits, as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Wine, and ſpirituous Liquors.</p>
               <p>38. Carminative are ſuch Things
as dilute and relax at the ſame time,
becauſe Wind occaſions a Spaſm or
Convulſion in ſome Part; whatever
promotes inſenſible Perſpiration is
Carminative, for Wind is perſpirable
Matter retain'd in the Body.</p>
               <p>39. All emollient relaxing Diet,
and all things which deſtroy Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
abate Pain.</p>
               <p>40. There are ſeveral Things ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in Diet which kill Worms, as
Oil, and Honey.</p>
               <p>Whoever attends to the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
barely hinted at in this Chapter,
will eaſily perceive that all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
purſued by Medicines, may
be obtain'd and inforc'd by Diet.</p>
               <p>It may be expected that I ſhould
ſay ſomething in this Chapter of the
Qualities of three exotick Plants,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0412300600:169"/>
whoſe Infuſions and Decoctions are
now much us'd in common Aliment,
Tea, Coffee and Chocolate: There
are many Treatiſes wrote about them,
which aſcribe to them both good
and bad Qualities, which they have
not. There is lately publiſhed a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
learned and elaborate Diſſertation
upon Tea, by Doctor <hi>Thomas Short,</hi>
in which the Author with great
Knowledge, Induſtry, and Skill, has
not only given us the natural Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Plant, but likewiſe its A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalyſis.</p>
               <p>But as the Infuſions and Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the foremention'd Vegetables
in common Water, are the only Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
of them in Uſe, there is no
neceſſity in this Place of conſidering
any of their Contents, but ſuch as
are extracted by thoſe ſimple Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Cookery.</p>
               <p>The green Leaves of Tea contain
a narcotick Juice, which exudes by
Roaſting. This is perform'd with
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0412300600:170"/>
great Care before it is expos'd to ſale.
The ſeveral Methods of diſcovering
the Adulterations of Tea by Coppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,
Galls, Spirit of Harts-horn, one
may ſee in the foremention'd Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.
Tea by its manner of affecting
the Organs of Taſte and Smell, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
very little of a volatile Spirit;
its Roſin or fix'd Oil which is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and aſtringent, cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by Water, but demands recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
Spirit. The active Principles of
it extracted by Infuſion, are the moſt
ſeparable Parts of its Oil or Gum,
and its Salt.</p>
               <p>Its Salt and Gum are aſtringent;
chalybeat Water draws from it a
Tincture of the ſame Colour as that
from Oak-leaves. It is aceſcent as
appears by its Effects upon Stomachs
troubled with Acidity. So that Tea
is an Infuſion of a Plant aceſcent,
and moderately aſtringent in warm
Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0412300600:171"/>
As a watery Liquor, it is diluting
and ſtimulating by its Salt: By its
aſtringent Quality it moderates the
relaxing Quality of warm Water.
By what has been ſaid before in this
Chapter, Water endu'd with any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
ſtimulating Subſtance is very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating,
and goes into the moſt
inward Receſſes of the circulating
Juices by its Quality, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſheth
the Brain and Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
but by its ſtyptick and ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
Quality it affects the Nerves,
very often occaſioning Tremors, by
its Heat it promotes Perſpiration, by
its watery Quality it diſſolves what
is viſcid in the Stomach, and ſo
ay help Digeſtion; but a ſtrong
Decoction of it is emetick, and
drinking too great Quantities may
relax and weaken the Tone of the
Stomach.</p>
               <p>As ſtimulating and diluting it is
diuretick, but as it is aſtringent, it
is not quite ſo proper where relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0412300600:172"/>
the urinary Paſſages is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
               <p>Milk abates ſome of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
Qualities, making it more ſoft
and nutritious, and Sugar as a Salt
increaſeth its <hi>Stimulus.</hi> From thoſe
Hints it follows, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Tea is
proper only for ſuch whoſe Bodies
are in ſuch a State as demands ſome
of the foremention'd Alterations.
Who theſe are, will be ſhown more
plainly in the following Chapter. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
That the immoderate Strength
and Quantity of this Liquor may be
hurtful in many Caſes, and to moſt
People.</p>
               <p>Coffee has in common with all
Nuts an Oil ſtrongly combin'd, and
entangled with earthy Particles.</p>
               <p>The moſt noxious Part of its Oil
exhales in roaſting to the Abatement
of near 1/4 of its Weight.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Philoſ. Tranſact.</note> One Pound of Coffee by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillations
afforded of volatile Spirit,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0412300600:173"/>
ſix Ounces ſix Drachms: of Oil, two
Ounces, two Drachms, two Scruples:
of <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> five Ounces three
Drachms. Tho' the Chymiſt did
not, or could not calcine the <hi>Caput
mortuum</hi> ſo as to obtain its fix'd Salt,
to be ſure it muſt have ſome.</p>
               <p>What is extracted by Water from
Coffee, is the moſt ſeparable Parts of
Oil which often ſwims a-top of the
Decoction. This Oil is Volatile,
and conſequently very little Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
               <p>Volatile Oils refreſh the Animal
Spirits, but likewiſe are endued with
all the bad Qualities of ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
producing all the Effects of
an oily and aromatical Acrimony
mention'd in the following Chapter,
as Dryneſs, Heat, Stimulation, Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
of the Nerves, from whence it
has been accus'd of cauſing Palſies,
Leanneſs, Watchfulneſs, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
maſculine Vigour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0412300600:174"/>
From theſe Qualities it is eaſy to
imagine that it muſt be hurtful to
hot, dry, bilious Conſtitutions, and
perhaps beneficial to Phlegmatick,
and that drank in too great a Degree
of Strength or Quantity hurtful to
every Body.</p>
               <p>Chocolate is certainly much the
beſt of thoſe three exotick Liquors,
its Oil ſeems to be both rich, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,
and anodyne; for an Oil
as ſoft as that of ſweet Almonds can
be extracted from the Nut, and the
<hi>Indians</hi> made Bread of it. This Oil
combin'd with its own Salt and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
makes it ſaponaceous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tergent,
by which Quality it often
helps Digeſtion and excites Appetite,
when it is mix'd with Vanillios or
Spices; it acquires likewiſe the good
and bad Qualities of aromatick Oils,
which are proper in ſome Caſes and
Conſtitutions, and very improper in
others.</p>

               <p>To enumerate the moſt common
Diverſities of the Conſtitutions of
Human Bodies.</p>
               <p>The moſt common Diverſities of
Human Conſtitutions ariſe either
from the ſolid Parts as to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Degrees of Strength and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
in ſome being too lax and
weak, in others too elaſtick and
ſtrong; or from the different State
of the Fluids, which, as they conſiſt
of Spirit, Water, Salts, Oil and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial
Parts, differ according to the
Redundance of the whole, or of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of theſe Ingredients, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are plethorick, phlegmatick, oily
or fat, ſaline, earthy or dry by the
Diſſipation of the moſt fluid Parts,
which laſt Conſtitution is call'd, by
the Antients, Atrabilarian or Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick.
A plethorick Conſtitution
in which true Blood abounds, is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0412300600:177"/>
call'd Sanguineous. A ſaline Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is either Acid, Alkaline, or Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatick,
according to the Difference
of the Salts which occaſion it.</p>
               <p>2. In ſome of theſe Senſes, tho'
every Human Conſtitution is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid,
yet are their Diſeaſes conſiſtent
with the common Functions of Life,
and leave them under their own
Conduct as to their Manner of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and therefore are a proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
for this Diſcourſe in which I am
far from pretending to inſtruct the
Brethren of the Profeſſion, or antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating

               <p>3. I think it proper to advertiſe

That I endeavour to give the moſt

abſtracting from the Complications
of the Firſt, or the Contra-indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Second. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That
in a Diſcourſe of this Nature, the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0412300600:178"/>
Reaſonings muſt be preciſe, tho' the
Practice may admit of great Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>PROP. II.</head>
               <p>To explain the Cauſes, Symptoms
and proper Diet of ſuch as have
weak and lax Fibres.</p>
               <p>1. In all the Fibres of an Animal
Body, and in the Sides of all the
Canals, there is a contractile Power
whereby the Fibres endeavour to
ſhorten themſelves. This is evident;
for if a Fibre be cut tranſverſly, both
the Ends ſhrink, and make the
Wound gape; the Force oppos'd to
this contractile Power of the Fibres,
is the influent Liquid. Health con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in the <hi>Equilibrium</hi> between thoſe
two Powers, when the Fluids move
ſo equally, that they don't preſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Solids with a greater Force
than they can bear, and no more in
one Part than in another; and on
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0412300600:179"/>
the other hand when the Solids re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
and act upon the Fluids ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
that there is no uneaſy Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Animal is in Health; on
the contrary when ever this <hi>Equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium</hi>
between the influent Fluids and
Solids is taken away the Animal is
in a morbid State; and whatever
deſtroys it in any Point, deſtroys it
in ſome meaſure through the whole
Body.</p>
               <p>2. The firſt and moſt ſimple So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids
of our Body are perhaps merely
terreſtrial, incapable of any Change
or Diſeaſe; of theſe Elements are
conſtituted the ſmalleſt Fibres, of
thoſe Fibres the Veſſels, of thoſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
the <hi>Viſcera</hi> or Organs of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
therefore the Weakneſs and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xity
of the Fibres, Veſſels, Viſcera,
and all Parts of the Body may be
conſidered as one Diſeaſe, tho' it
muſt be own'd that the Diſeaſe is
not always univerſal, and there will
be ſometimes a Weakneſs in ſome
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0412300600:180"/>
Organ with a great Degree of muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Strength.</p>
               <p>3. A Fibre is ſaid to be weak
when the Coheſion of its Parts is ſo
ſmall that it may be broken, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
by a Force not much greater
than what happens commonly in the
Body of a healthy Perſon: Debility
of the Veſſels or Organs is ſo ſmall
a Coheſion of the conſtituent Parts
as makes them unable to diſcharge
the common Functions of Life, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
in a State of Health. Tho'
there is a Debility of Fibres in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
abſolutely ſpeaking, yet it is
no Diſeaſe, becauſe their Fibres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lax, lengthen by the Influx of
the Liquids which is the Cauſe of
their Growth; but in adult Perſons,
when the Fibres cannot any more
yield, they muſt either break or loſe
their Spring.</p>
               <p>4. Laxity of a Fibre is ſuch a
ſmall Coheſion of its Parts, as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
it to be lengthen'd by a ſmall
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0412300600:181"/>
Force: Laxity is a Species of Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>5. The moſt common Cauſes of
Debility of Fibres are, <hi>Firſt,</hi> A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
or great Loſs of the vital nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Juices: If there is not Blood
enough the Chyle cannot be eaſily
aſſimilated. A Perſon who loſeth
daily great Quantities of Blood turns
Dropſical and Leucophlegmatick.
An elaſtick Fibre like a Bow, the
more it is extended, reſtores itſelf
with the greater Force; if the Spring
be deſtroy'd, it is like a Bag only
paſſive as to the Influx of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> Nouriſhment too
viſcid and glutinous to be ſubdu'd
by the vital Force; of this Sort <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
reckoned unfermented Bread.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> A ſedentary Life, for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
increaſeth the Circulation of the
Juices, and conſequently the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the ſolid Parts to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
<hi>Fourthly,</hi> Too great an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the Fibres by Plenitude;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0412300600:182"/>
a Lute-ſtring will bear a hundred
Weight without Rupture; but at
the ſame time cannot exert its Elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
take away fifty, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
it raiſeth the Weight. <hi>Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
A moiſt Atmoſphere. The At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere
is what keeps the Fibres
of an Animal Body together, we
feel our Fibres grow ſtrict or lax ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the State of the Air; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
who live healthy in a dry Air, fall
into all the Diſeaſes that depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Relaxation in a moiſt one. <hi>Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
A natural Weakneſs from the
Frame and Conſtitution of the Body.</p>
               <p>6. The common Signs and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of weak Fibres are Paleneſs,
Smoothneſs, Coldneſs of the Skin,
Colour of the Blood not Florid (for
what maketh that is a ſtrong action
of the Solids) a weak Pulſe, Tume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions
in the whole Body or Parts,
Stagnation of Humours, and its
conſequence Putrefactions; for when
the force of the Veſſels and Preſſure
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0412300600:183"/>
of the Air is taken off, all the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
expand themſelves, and what
ſtagnates muſt putrify; if a Perſon
of a firm Conſtitution begins to
bloat, and from being warm grows
cold, his Fibres grow weak. Anxiety
and Palpitations of the Heart are a
ſign of weak Fibres: Acid Eructati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon taking Vegetable Food, or
Nidoroſe upon taking Animal is a
ſign of weak Organs of Digeſtion.
Depravation of the Humours from a
ſound State, to what the Phyſicians
call by the general Name of a Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymy,
Spots and Diſcolorations of
the Skin are ſigns of weak Fibres;
for the lateral Veſſels which lie out
of the Road of Circulation, let groſs
Humours paſs, which could not if the
Veſſels had their due Degree of
ſtricture. Atrophy as denoting a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
or Obſtruction of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
which carry the Nouriſhment,
and Dropſies proceed from a Laxity
of the Fibres being too weak to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
the Fluid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0412300600:184"/>
7. It is evident that the Aliment
of Perſons with weak Fibres, ought
to be ſuch as requires but a ſmall
force to convert it into Animal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
ſuch is that mention'd
Chap. V. Prop. IV. V. Milk is the
Chylous part of an Animal already
prepar'd, the Cheeſy part is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and diſſolv'd by the Bile, and the
more Serous and Spiritous Part en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
into the Blood, meer Whey is
too relaxing, Eggs taken warm from
the Hen; for the moſt elaborate and
ſpiritous Part is loſt in the dreſſing
Broths made of Fleſh, which are
the Nutritious Animal Juices ſeparated
from the ſolid Parts. The Alkaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Quality of them may be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
if neceſſary, by mixing them with
ſome Acid. Decoctions, and Creams,
or Jellies of well fermented Bread, (for
Fermentation as was hinted Chap. III.
Prop. IV. deſtroys the glutinous
oily Viſcidity with which mealy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
abound) auſtere Wines di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0412300600:185"/>
with Water, which cool more
than Water alone, and at the ſame
time do not relax, Vegetables with
an acid auſtere Juice mention'd
Chap V. Prop. IV. VIII. are all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in this Caſe. Relaxation from Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
is cur'd by ſpare Diet, and from
any Cauſe by that which is contrary to
it. Care muſt be taken in contracting
the Fibres, not to obſtruct the Veſſels.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="part">
               <head>PROP. III.</head>
               <p>To explain the Symptoms, Cauſes,
and proper Diet of ſuch as have too
ſtrong and too elaſtick Fibres.</p>
               <p>1. A State oppoſite to the former
is too great Rigidity and Elaſticity
of the Fibres, which is ſuch a Degree
of Coheſion as makes them inflexible
to the Cauſes, to which they ought
to yield, ſo as to preſerve the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
in Health: Too great Elaſticity
is that Quality by which they not
only reſiſt againſt Elongation, but
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0412300600:186"/>
reſtore themſelves with too great
Preſſure and Force upon the moving
Fluid.</p>
               <p>Rigidity of the Organs is ſuch a
State as makes them reſiſt that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion,
which is neceſſary to carry
on the Vital Functions. Rigidity of
the Veſſels and Organs muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
follow from Rigidity of the
Fibres, both as the Fibres are their
conſtituent Parts, and likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by the ſtrong Force of the
Heart and Motion of the Fluids,
many of the Solids are compacted into
one, and the Canals, through which
they flow'd, aboliſh'd as by Prop. VII.
Chap. II.</p>
               <p>2. True Health conſiſts in ſuch a
Flexibility of Fibres as yield to the
Force of the Heart, ſo as to admit
the influent Fluid, and then ſuch a
due Spring to reſtore themſelves ſo
as to drive it forward; for if the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
were entirely rigid, or the Force
of the Fibres in reſtoring themſelves
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0412300600:187"/>
were either in Equilibrium with, or
exceeding that of the Heart, there
could be no Circulation, even if the
Veſſels drive back the Blood with
too great a Force upon the Heart,
it will produce Polypoſe Concreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Ventricles of the Heart,
eſpecially when the Valves of the
Heart are apt themſelves to grow too
rigid, if but one Drop of Blood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the Heart at every Pulſe;
thoſe in many Pulſes will grow to a
conſiderable Maſs.</p>
               <p>3. It is eaſy by the Laws of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draulicks
to determine the natural
Effects of ſuch a Conſtitution, which
is the Parent of acute Diſeaſes, as
Laxity of Chronical.</p>
               <p>4. The Cauſe of ſuch a Diſeaſe
beſides the Natural Conſtitution
and Frame of the Body is too long
a Continuance of ſuch Diet as
ſtrengthens the Fibres, hard Exerciſe
or Labour, ſuch as uſe it, according
to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> are not eaſily cur'd of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0412300600:188"/>
Pleuriſies; ſuch a Conſtitution is
eaſily known by the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of the Body being lean,
warm, hairy, ſcraggy, dry without a
Diſeaſe, with hard and firm Muſcles,
for the great Force by which the
ſmall Veſſels reſtore themſelves, makes
them grow narrow, expelling the
Liquor they contain, and ſcarce ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
what is influent by which
the Veſſels grow hard and contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
laſtly by the Strength of the
Pulſe, and the Force of the vital
Actions.</p>
               <p>5. The Rules of Diet for ſuch a
Conſtitution may be drawn from
Prop. IV. of the foregoing Chapter.
<hi>Firſt,</hi> Abſtinence from things us'd
in the contrary State of too great
Laxity. Milk is too nouriſhing, but
Whey proper as an Emollient. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere
and ſtrong Wines are improper
but much more ſo are inflammable
Spirits which harden the Fibres; Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is the proper Drink being ſtrongly
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0412300600:189"/>
relaxing, there is no better way of
ſuppling a Carcaſs then by drenching
it in Water. All Emollient Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſuch as Fruits which contain a
Mucilage, and may be boil'd into Jel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
Pot Herbs of the Emollient kind,
ſuch things as reſolve and cleanſe,
that is take away any tenacious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
which adheres to the Fibres, ſuch
are Vegetable Soaps, the chief of
which is Honey. The Animal Food
ſhould be prepar'd in Broths rather
than in any other form, all things
which increaſe Fat, all oily Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
The Animal Oils, Cream, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Marrow, farinaceous Subſtances
unfermented, as little Salt in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment
as poſſible, for Salt hardens.</p>
               <p>6. From thoſe two Cauſes of the
Laxity and Rigidity of the Fibres,
the Methodiſts an ancient Set of
Phyſicians deriv'd all Diſeaſes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Bodies with a great deal of
Reaſon, for the Fluids derive their
Qualities from the Solids. There
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0412300600:190"/>
ſeems hardly any other Account to
be given of the different Animal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions,
than the different Configu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and Action of the ſolid
Parts, which from one Homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Liquor ſeparate ſo many various
Fluids in an Animal Body, and I
am of Opinion, that in moſt caſes
where the Juices are in a morbid
State, if one could ſuppoſe all the
unſound Juices taken away, and
ſound Juices immediately transfus'd,
the Quality of the ſolid Parts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
the ſame, after many
Circulations the ſound Juices would
grow morbid. The Methodiſts err'd
in ſo far as they conſider'd the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
inhering only in the Vaſcular
Solids, and applied their Remedies
chiefly to them, not reflecting that
the Solids themſelves can be changed
by working upon the Fluids.</p>

               <p>1. A ſanguineous Conſtitution (in
the common Acceptation of the
word) that is of a Perſon who abounds
with Blood is different from a Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorick;
the common outward Sign
of ſuch a Conſtitution is a florid
Appearance in the Countenance, a
Blueneſs and Fullneſs of the Veins,
Softneſs of the Fleſh, a particular
vivid, fair, but not pale Colour of
the Skin, ſuch a Conſtitution with
a great Appearance of Health is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

2. The Blood as was obſerved,
Prop. V. Chap. II. conſiſts of red
Globules ſwimming in a thin Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
call'd Serum, the red part is
ſmalleſt in quantity. The red Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules
are Elaſtick, and will break,
one red Globule into ſix ſmall, and
then they will turn yellow, thoſe
yellow Globules break into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſtill ſmaller, and then they
grow more white and tranſparent; the
Veſſels, which admit the ſmaller Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules,
cannot admit the greater with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Diſeaſe. Therefore as the Blood
paſſeth through narrower Channels,
the Redneſs diſappears more and more.
All the Chyle is white, and acquires
this red Colour by Circulation. A
free and ſtrong Projectile Motion of
the Blood muſt occaſion a florid Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
upon the Skin in ſuch
Conſtitutions, becauſe a ſtronger
Motion forceth the red part into
more capillary Veſſels. To which
likewiſe there is commonly another
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0412300600:194"/>
Cauſe that concurs, the greater Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parency
of the Veſſels occaſioned by
the Thinneſs and Delicacy of their
Coats. That this is the Caſe of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guineous
Perſons is plain, from their
great Veins appearing blue and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
by the Colour of the Blood
in them.</p>
               <p>3. Therefore ſuch Perſons ſeem to
be ſuſceptible of Diſeaſes, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon a ſtrong projectile Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Blood, and too great
Thinneſs and Delicacy of the Veſſels;
by the firſt they are ſubject to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory
Diſtempers, for the greater
Action or Reaction of the Fluids and
Solids produceth a greater Attrition,
to which Heat is proportional: This
great Attrition muſt produce a great
Propenſity to the putreſcent alkaline
Condition of the Fluids, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to Suppuration: a ſtronger
projectile Motion of the Blood, muſt
likewiſe occaſion greater Secretions,
and loſs of liquid Parts; and from
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0412300600:195"/>
thence perhaps Spiſſitude and corea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous
Concretions, which are always
found in Animals that die of too
ſtrong a Circulation.</p>
               <p>If the Veſſels are in a ſtate of too
great Rigidity ſo as not to yield, a
ſtrong projectile Motion occaſions
their Rupture and Haemorragies; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
in the Lungs, where the
Blood is abundant; if the Veſſels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of breaking yield, it ſubjects
the Perſon to all the Inconveniences
of an erroneous Circulation, (that is,
when the Blood ſtrays into the Veſſels
deſtin'd to carry Serum or Lymph,
according to Prop. V. Chap. II.)
From whence will follow Obſtructions
and Inflammations, and as the Thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Delicacy of the Veſſels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
reigns through the whole Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,
it muſt affect the Glands and

and all the Diſeaſes thereon depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>4. The natural Helps from Diet
are firſt Moderation in the quantity,
and all things which relax the Veins;
for what does ſo, prevents too vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a Motion through the Arteries:
Therefore relaxing and cooling are
proper Intentions in the Diet, only
where there are ſigns of too great a
Thinneſs in the Fluids. Subacid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
are proper, tho' they are a
little Aſtringent; for Perſons who take
a great deal of Vinegar, abate their
florid Colour, which is the Diſeaſe
of ſuch a Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>For ſuch a Diet the Reader is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to the foregoing Chapter.</p>
               <p>A Saline Conſtitution of the Fluids
is either Acid, Alkaline, or Muria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
as in the Sea-Scurvy: Of theſe in
their turns.</p>

               <head>PROP. VI.</head>
               <p>To explain the Symptoms, Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and proper Diet of Acid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.</p>
               <p>1. It has been demonſtrated b<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the Juices of a ſound Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
are neither Acid nor Alkaline,
by the Experiments mention'd
Chapter IV. All the Subſtances
Fluid, and Solid, of an Animal fed,
even with aceſcent Subſtances, yield
by fire, nothing but Alkaline Salts.
Thoſe Experiments which endeavour
to ſhew the contrary, have been made
upon Animals, which had taken
much Sea-Salt, which is never totally
changed in an Animal Body. The
ingenious and learned <hi>Boerhaave</hi> fed
a Sparrow with Bread four Days, in
which time it eat more than its own
weight, and yet there was no Acid
found in its Body or Excrements.
The reaſon of this is, that the vital
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0412300600:198"/>
Force of a ſound Animal is capable
to tranſmute the Acid Subſtances it
takes in Aliment, into ſoft nutritious
animal Liquids by its vital Force (by
which is underſtood the ſumm of all
thoſe Powers in an Animal Body,
which converts its Aliment into
Fluids of its own Nature) a Cow
fed with Trefoil, Daiſies, Sorrel,
gives Milk, in which there is not
the leaſt Acidity; but if this vital
Force is weak, it is inſufficient to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
the Acidity of the Subſtances
taken by the Mouth. The Liquors,
which are made of fermented Plants,
as Wine and Malt Liquors ſtanding
in a Heat not greater than that of
a human Body, turn ſour; and ſo
they will in a human Body that has
not ſufficient vital Force to change
them, which makes no more Alteration
in ſuch Subſtances, than a Veſſel
with the ſame degree of Heat and
Moiſture. Thus weak Stomachs vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
up the Wine that they drink in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0412300600:199"/>
too great Quantities to be digeſted,
in me form of Vinegar. Put Bread
into the Stomach of a dying Man,
and it will follow its own Nature,
and undergo the Alteration that is
merely the Effect of Heat. A weak
Stomach will turn Rye-Bread into
Vinegar, and a Plough-Man will
digeſt it. Mealy Subſtances ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
turn ſour, and unfermented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mix'd with a ſmall Quantity of
Water they turn viſcid, and then
hard like Stones: accordingly given
to a weak Child they ſtill retain
their Nature; for Bread will give
him the Cholick, and unfermented
farinaceous Subſtances will fill his
Belly with a viſcous Humour.</p>
               <p>2. As no Acid is naturally in an
Animal Body, but muſt be taken in
by the Mouth; ſo if it is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd
in the Paſſages of the Chyle,
it may get into the Blood; and if
there is not a ſufficient Quantity of
Blood, and Strength of Circulation
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0412300600:200"/>
to ſubdue it, it may infect the
whole Maſs of the Fluids; but this
is a morbid State. The Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
made upon Chyle have never
diſcover'd any Acidity in it; but the
Subject of theſe Experiments has
been always the Chyle of healthy
Animals.</p>
               <p>3. The firſt and principal Seat of
Acidity is the Stomach; this Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Chyle is in ſome meaſure
taken off in the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> and by the
Mixture of Bile with it, grows leſs in
the other Parts of the alimentary
Duct, and ſtill leſs in the Thoracick
Duct, becauſe great Quantities of
Animal Liquors have been mix'd with
it; but at laſt it may (as was ſaid
before) infect the Blood: Thus it is
found by Experience, that the Sweat
is ſometimes acid, which is a Sign
of Recovery after acute Diſtempers,
where the Blood was in the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
alkaleſcent Diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0412300600:201"/>
4. The Antecedent Concomitants
and Effects of ſuch a Conſtitution,
are Acids taken in too great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities:
Sour Eructations, a craving Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
eſpecially of terreſtrial and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbent
Subſtances, the Caſe of Girls
in the Green Sickneſs, Sourneſs in
the Stomach, Pain in the Stomach
(which tho' ſometimes occaſion'd by
an acrid Bile, this Cauſe may be
diſtinguiſh'd by the Abſence of other
Symptoms) Colical Pains about the
Navel, the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> dry Gripes are
perhaps occaſion'd by the too great
Quantities of Acids, as Lime-juice in
Punch. The Colicks of Infants
proceed from Acidity, and the Air
in the Aliment expanding itſelf while
the Aliment ferments; for Oil of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol
will throw the Stomach into
involuntary Contractions, Inactivity
and Change of Colour in the Bile;
for Acids change the Colour and
Conſiſtence of it. Bile is the chief
Inſtrument of Digeſtion, and as was
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0412300600:202"/>
ſaid before, <hi>Prop.</hi> V. <hi>Chap.</hi> I. can
attenuate the cheeſy Subſtance in the
Stomach of a Calf, and render it
fluid; hence bilious Conſtitutions ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
digeſt Cheeſe, a ſour Smell of
the Faeces (when the Bile is redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
they ſmell cadaverous) acid
Sweats, Paleneſs of the Skin; for as
was obſerv'd before, taking much
Vinegar will make the Lips pale. It
is poſſible that Tumors in the Breaſts
may be the Effect of Acidity in the
Milk, and Convulſions in Infants
may be occaſion'd from Acidity paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
into the Blood, and affecting
the tender Fibres of the Brain. Some
Sorts of cutaneous Eruptions are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
by feeding much on acid
unripe Fruits, and farinaceous Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>5. Acidity, as it is not the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
State of the Animal Fluids, but
induc'd by Aliment, is to be cur'd
by Aliment, with the contrary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;
for which the Reader is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0412300600:203"/>
to the foregoing Chapter. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-acid
Medicines are ineffectual with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Diet of the ſame Kind; all
Animal Diet is Alkaleſcent, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of ſuch as feed upon other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
as Infects, Fiſh; and eſpecially
Shell-Fiſh. Acidity in the Infant
may be cur'd by a Fleſh-Diet; in
the Nurſe. There are a great many
anti-acid Vegetables which do not
eaſily ferment, but putrify, as all the
warm Anti-ſcorbuticks: Selery, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragus,
Cabbage, Turnips, Carrots,
Onions, Leeks, Radiſhes, Muſtard,
Eringo-Roots and Nettles, are An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-acid.
In Caſes of Acidity, Water is
the proper Drink, its Quality of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing
too much may be corrected
by boiling it with ſome Animal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
as Ivory, Harts-horn: Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from fermented Liquors is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p>6. This Diſtemper is moſt inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to Children, becauſe of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of their Fibres and Milk-Diet,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0412300600:204"/>
to ſuch as lead a ſedentary Life, to
thoſe who take much Bread and
Wine, and vegetable Acids, to Girls
diſpos'd to the Green Sickneſs, and
to Artificers who deal in the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of Acids, as Diſtillers, Dyers.</p>

               <head>PROP. VII.</head>
               <p>To explain the Symptoms, Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and proper Diet of Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which abound with a ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Alkali.</p>
               <p>1. A Conſtitution oppoſite to the
former is that which abounds with a
ſpontaneous Alkali. No Animal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putrify'd
being burnt, yields any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaline
Salt, but putrify'd yields a
volatile Alkali, therefore in a healthy
Animal no true Alkali is found; but
as an Animal degenerates from this
State, by ſuch Diſeaſes as increaſe
the Attrition and Heat of the Fluids,
the Animal Salts formerly benign
approach towards an alkaline Nature,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0412300600:205"/>
Human Blood, when it is firſt let, is
mild, and will not make the Eye or
a freſh Wound ſmart. Let it ſtand
in a Degree of Heat equal to that of
a Human Body, it will grow in three
Days, fetid, the Salt of it volatile and
alkaline fermenting with Acids, the
Oil that remains volatile and rancid;
the Blood in the Veſſels may at laſt
arrive at the ſame State, but muſt
paſs thro' infinite Degrees, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it comes to the laſt, the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
will be deſtroyed. All Animal
Subſtances expos'd to the Air turn
Alkaline of their own accord, and
ſome Vegetables by Heat will not
turn acid but alkaline: Every Plant in
that State of Putrefaction by <hi>Prop.</hi>
III. <hi>Chap.</hi> I. is converted as it were
into an Animal Subſtance, by Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Trials yielding the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
               <p>2. The Cauſes of ſuch a Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
is a Diet of alkaleſcent Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
If a Woman ſhould live upon
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0412300600:206"/>
Vegetables, Bread, and fermented
Liquors, her Milk would be aceſcent
or ready to turn ſour; if only on
Animal Food her Milk would be
apt to turn fetid and putrid, but not
ſour.</p>
               <p>If it was poſſible to take Muſtard
in great Quantities, it would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bring the Blood into this alkaline
State, and deſtroy the Animal; the
warm antiſcorbutical Plants taken in
Quantities will occaſion ſtinking
Breath, and corrupt the Blood. All
Animals that live upon other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
have their Juices more alkaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
than ſuch as live upon Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and for that Reaſon perhaps
Fiſhes have this Quality more than
terreſtrial Animals; for in the open
Air they putrify ſooner, by what
was ſaid <hi>Prop.</hi> I. <hi>Chap.</hi> IV. An Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
with a ſtrong vital Force of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
will turn Acids into Animal
Subſtances; but if its Food be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
alkaleſcent, its Juices will be
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0412300600:207"/>
more ſo. No Perſon is able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
a Diet of Fleſh and Water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Acids, as Salt, Vinegar, and
Bread, without falling into a putrid
Fever. If his Diet conſiſted of Snails,
Fiſh, eſpecially their Livers, Shell-Fiſh,
Vipers, ravenous Birds, as ſome
who feed upon Inſects and alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcent
Vegetables, the Effect would
happen ſooner. Eggs and <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Wines, taken in great Quantities with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Exerciſe, will occaſion a Fever. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of good Blood and laudable
Juices diſpoſeth towards this alkaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
State. Likewiſe long Abſtinence,
(by which the Fluids are depriv'd of
a Dilution of the cooling Emulſion
of freſh Chyle. See <hi>Prop.</hi> VIII. <hi>Chap.</hi>
II.) great Strength of the Bowels, and
a right State and Abundance of Bile.
Bile is an anti-acid. Another Cauſe
is a vigorous Action of the Veſſels,
through which the Juices circulate,
which is the Reaſon ſtrong healthy
and young People are more in peril
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0412300600:208"/>
by peſtilential Fevers, than the Weak
and Old.</p>
               <p>Violent Animal Motion produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
this alkaline State. Two hard
Bones rubb'd hard againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or with a File, produce a fetid
Smell. It is poſſible to produce a
Gangrene by ſtrong Friction, and
yet Stagnation of the Fluids turns
them putrid.</p>
               <p>The Effects of ſuch an alkaleſcent
State in any great Degree, are Thirſt,
and a Dejection of Appetite, which pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid
Things occaſion more than any
other; (thoſe who are troubled with
Acidity have often a bad Digeſtion,
but a craving Appetite) nidoroſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ructations,
which are different from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid,
Foulneſs of the Tongue and
Palate, a bitter and hot Taſte in the
Mouth, Thirſt, Sickneſs, Loathing,
bilious Vomitings and Dejections of
a cadaverous Smell, iliacal Pains with
Heat. Theſe are the Effects of it
in the alimentary Diet. Such a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0412300600:209"/>
State diſſolves the Blood, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
it towards Putrefaction, hinders
Nutrition; for no Chicken can be
hatch'd of a rotten Egg, the Blood
turning acrimonious corrodes the
Veſſels producing Hemorrhages, Puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tules
red, lead-colour'd, black and
gangrenous, and almoſt all Diſeaſes
of the inflammatory Kind.</p>
               <p>3. The Aliment of ſuch Perſons
ought to be aceſcent Subſtances, as
Bread, Vinegar, ſuch as are deſcrib'd
in the foregoing Chapter. Acids
keep Animal Subſtances from Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
for neither Blood, Fleſh or
Fat will putrify in Vinegar, or ſour
Wine: The Effect of the ſtrongeſt
Acids, even Oil of Vitriol in putrid
Fevers, is known by Experience, in
which your alkaline Spirits muſt be
hurtful, farinaceous Things, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch as are made of Oats, are
proper as having an aceſcent Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
it is a common Miſtake that
People in ſuch a State ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0412300600:210"/>
Wine. Thin Wines, as Rheniſh,
Moſelle mix'd with Water are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in a Fever. But when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper
is attended with great Heat,
Milk mixed with Water is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt
Drink. The propereſt Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
is Salt-petre; Sea-ſalt creates
Thirſt, Water is the only Diluent;
but as it has no Acidity in it, it is
better mix'd with Limon, or with
the Rob or Jelly of ſome acid Fruit,
ſometimes the demulcent Aliment
mention'd <hi>Prop.</hi> IV. of the foregoing
Chapter, will be of great Uſe.</p>
               <p>The muriatick Scurvy induced
commonly by too great Quantity
of Sea-ſalt, and common among
Mariners, is rather an artificial than
a natural Diſeaſe, ſpontaneous only
in few who have a great Diſpoſition
towards it. Its common Symptoms
are a ſaline Taſte in the Spittle, Itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and red Eroſions of the Skin,
great Thirſt, Dryneſs of the Skin, a
lixivial Urine ſometimes with a fatty
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0412300600:211"/>
Subſtance like a thin Skin a-top,
Relief from watery and acid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
The Cure of this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
lies in a Diet of freſh unſalted
Things, watery Liquors acidulated,
farinaceous emollient Subſtances, ſour
Milk, Butter Milk, acid Fruits, and
avoiding of the hot Antiſcorbuticks
of the Muſtard Kind, the Rule of
Diet is not much different from that
in the alkaline Scurvy before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.</p>
               <p>5. It is of great Importance to
know whether cutaneous Diſtempers
proceed from an acid or alkaline
Cauſe, becauſe, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the Cauſe, there muſt be
quite oppoſite Methods of Cure;
they may be diſtinguiſh'd firſt by the
difference of the Diet that occaſion'd
them, crude Aliment, farinaceous Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
unripe Fruits, and other Aceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
will ſometimes produce the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
and Itch, and even Leproſies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on the ſame cauſe, in which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0412300600:212"/>
volatile Salts, and ſuch as are taken
from Animal Subſtances are indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> From the Abſence of
the concomitant Symptoms of the
one, and the other: in the acid Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
there is not Thirſt, Heat nor
ſo great a Dejection of Appetite as
in the Alkaline. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the Skin are not of ſo deep
a Colour in the Acid as Alkaline. In
general, an Attention to the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
before enumerated may be a
Guide to the Diet.</p>
               <p>6. Another Conſtitution of the
Fluids of a Human Body, may be
properly call'd Glutinous or Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick:
Phlegm amongſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
ſignified a cold viſcous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
contrary to the Etymology of
the Word which comes from <add>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </add>,
to burn; but amongſt them there
were two Sorts of Phlegm, cold and
hot. A cold Tumor they call'd ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
Phlegmonem; when it came from
glutinous Blood, they call'd it Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monem
Phlegmenodem.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0412300600:213"/>
7. Phlegm or Pituite is a Sort of
ſemi-fluid, it being ſo far ſolid, that
one Part draws along ſeveral other
Parts adhering to it, which doth not
happen in a perfect Fluid, and yet
no Part will draw the whole Maſs,
as happens in a perfect Solid.</p>
               <p>8. The Pituite or Mucus ſecern'd
in the Noſe, Mouth, Palate, Stomach,
Inteſtines, and Wind-Pipe, is not an
excrementitious but a laudable Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
neceſſary for defending thoſe
Parts from which it is ſecern'd, from
Excoriations, as happens in the Noſe,
when the Pituite is too thin. The
Want of it in the Wind-Pipe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
Hoarſeneſs, in the Gullet and
Difficulty of Swallowing. The Pituite
defends the Inteſtines from the Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Ingeſta, and lubricates
the Extremities of the Joints. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thoſe are miſtaken who imagine
that Phlegm cannot be too much
purg'd off; but when the Phlegm is
either too viſcous, or ſeparates in too
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0412300600:214"/>
great a Quantity, it brings the Body
into a morbid State; this viſcous
Phlegm ſeems to be the vitrious Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuite
of the Ancients.</p>
               <p>9. The firſt Seat of it is the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Duct where it creates Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
Dejection of Appetite, a Senſe
of Repletion and Sickneſs; for it
hinders the natural Contraction of
the Fibres, and that Senſe of Irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which produceth Hunger. A
Senſation of Fullneſs without eating
is a ſure Sign of a phlegmatick Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.
In the Inteſtines it occaſions
a Tumor of the Belly, with an Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
in the reſt of the Body; for
the viſcous Cruſt ſtops the Entry of
the Chyle into the Lacteals. The
Caſe of rickety Children. In the
Body it often affects the Lungs,
Phlegm may be ſo concocted in the
Lungs by the Evaporation of its
moſt liquid Parts as to ſhut up the
Paſſages of the Bronchea, and it makes
Paleneſs in the Skin; for as it was
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0412300600:215"/>
obſerv'd before, our Aliment in the
form of Chyle before it circulates
with the Blood is whitiſh, by the
Force of Circulation, it runs through
all the intermediate Colours till it
ſettles in an intenſe Red; as much
as the Force of Circulation is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
ſo much will the Blood fall
ſhort of that florid Colour, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in that Condition are call'd
Leucophlegmatick; from this Phlegm
proceed white cold Tumors, Viſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
and conſequently Immeability
of the Juices; hence Lethargies in
old People.</p>
               <p>10. The Cauſes of this phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Conſtitution are, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Viſcid
Aliment as of unripe Fruits, farina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous
Subſtances unfermented and
taken in great Quantities. The Flowers
of Grains mix'd with Water will
make a ſort of Glue. Meals have
an Oil in them which makes their
Parts adhere. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Great Loſs
or Want of Blood which is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0412300600:216"/>
Soap, preſerving itſelf and the
Aliment from Coagulation by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Motion. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Weakneſs and
Indigeſtion in the alimentary Duct
which leaves the Aliment viſcous.
<hi>Fourthly,</hi> A Defect or bad Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Bile (which is the chief
Reſolvent of the Aliment) phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
and bilious Conſtitutions are
oppoſite. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Diſſipation of the
moſt fluid Parts by Heat or ſome
great Evacuation, therefore profuſe
Sweats, and Fluxes of Urine diſpoſe
towards this Conſtitution by thicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Phlegm. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Stagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Debility of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Excretion for if the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuite
ſtagnates, it muſt grow viſcid
from Heat. Theſe are the Cauſes
and Symptoms of a phlegmatick
cold Conſtitution, but Spiſſitude at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with Heat grows inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
               <p>11. The Symptoms point to the
Cure. All the Methods of atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating,

well fermented Bread, and well fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
Liquors, Fermentation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
the Viſcidity of farinaceous
Subſtances. High ſeaſon'd Aliment
is proper for Phlegmaticks. Spices,
Onions, Garlick, diſſolve Viſcidity.
Water impregnated with ſome ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
Subſtance which both dilutes
and attenuates. Hot Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are the beſt Diſſolvers of Phlegm.
All Sorts of Nouriſhment which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Heat, and a vigorous Motion
of the Blood, and for that Reaſon
Broths made of the moſt volatile and
alkaleſcent Parts of Animals.</p>
               <p>12. A Diſeaſe oppoſite to this
Spiſſitude is too great Fluidity, the
Symptoms of which are Exceſs of
Animal Secretions as of Perſpiration,
Swear, Urine, Liquid, Dejectures,
Leanneſs, Weakneſs, and Thirſt. The
Methods in ſuch a Caſe muſt be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to the former. Farinaceous
Subſtances, and watery Liquors, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fermented
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0412300600:218"/>
Gellies of Animal and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable
Subſtances, all ſuch Things
as are deſcrib'd <hi>Prop.</hi> IV. <hi>Chap.</hi> V.</p>
               <p>13. Another Conſtitution is the oily
or fat; Animal Fat is a Sort of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibious
Subſtance, it is ſciſſile like
a Solid, reſolvable by Heat not greater
than what is incident to Human
Bodies, circumſcrib'd and contain'd
in proper Veſſels, like a Fluid. The
Symptoms of this Conſtitution are
too manifeſt to want a Deſcription,
it co-incides often with the pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
and phlegmatick Conſtitutions
above deſcrib'd. It is but one Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Corpulency, for there may
be Bulk without Fat, from the great
Quantity of muſcular Fleſh, the Caſe
of robuſt People. An Animal in the
Courſe of hard Labour ſeems to be
nothing, but Veſſels, Bones and muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Fleſh. Let the ſame Animal
continue long in Reſt, it will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
double in Weight and Bulk.
This Superaddition is nothing but
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0412300600:219"/>
Fat or Oil, and in this Senſe an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
perhaps never arrives at its full
Growth.</p>
               <p>14. The common Cauſes of this
Diſtemper are a particular, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a gentilitious Diſpoſition of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which ſeems to conſiſt in the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopoetick
or Organs of the firſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
being ſtrong, and the Fibres
of the circulating Veſſels, eſpecially
thoſe about the <hi>Panniculus carnoſus</hi>
being lax, according to the Doctrine
of the ſecond Chapter. By the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Fibres of the Veſſels up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Fluids the oily Parts of the
Chyle are intimately mix'd with the
Blood, which by <hi>Prop.</hi> III. <hi>Chap.</hi> II.
will ſwim a top of it ſeveral Hours
after Repaſt; when this Action is not
ſtrong enough, and the Chyle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
copious, perhaps the thicker
Oil is never entirely ſubdu'd; ſome
Sorts of cramm'd Fowl have always
a milky Juice ſwimming a-top of
their Blood. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Quantities of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0412300600:220"/>
oily Nouriſhment, Milk, Butter, and
oily fermented Liquors. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All
Things which occaſion Coldneſs in
the Skin ſo as to ſtop Perſpiration,
by which the oily Parts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal'd,
which Heat reſolves and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuates.
The Inhabitants of cold
moiſt Countries are generally more
fat than thoſe of warm and dry; but
the moſt common Cauſe is too great
a Quantity of Food, and too ſmall
a Quantity of Motion, in plain <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
Gluttony, and Lazineſs. I am
of Opinion that ſpare Diet and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
will keep Conſtitutions, where
this Diſpoſition is the ſtrongeſt, from
being fat. You may ſee in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
forty thouſand Foot-Soldiers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a fat Man amongſt them; and I
dare affirm that by Plenty and Reſt,
twenty of the forty ſhall grow fat.</p>
               <p>15. The Oil in Animals is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for many Purpoſes; in all for
Motion, in ſome for Nouriſhment;
ſuch accumulate Fat in the Summer
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0412300600:221"/>
which ſerves to refreſh the Blood in
the Penury of Aliment during the
Winter, and for that purpoſe ſome
Animals have a quadruple Omen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.
But the too great abundance
of Fat ſubjects Human Conſtitutions
to the following Inconveniences.</p>
               <p>16. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It hinders the Motion
of the Joints by making them more
heavy by filling the Spaces, occupy'd
by the Muſcles when they contract
and ſwell. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It ſubjects them
to all the Diſeaſes depending upon a
defective projectile Motion of the
Blood; for the Blood flows through
the Veſſels by the Exceſs of the Force
of the Heart above the incumbent
Preſſure, which in fat People is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive;
and as want of a due Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Motion of the Fluids increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Fat, the Diſeaſe is the Cauſe of
itſelf. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To Suppurations, of
which the <hi>Membrana adipoſa</hi> is the
chief Seat. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To danger in
inflammatory Diſtempers, a Fever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0412300600:222"/>
many Things which ſtagnate,
and amongſt others the Fat, which
being mix'd with the Blood turns
volatile, and occaſions an Acrimony
much more dangerous than the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line;
for Salts can be diluted with
Water which Oils cannot. That the
Fat is diſſolv'd by Fevers, is evident
from the great loſs of Fat which
People undergo in Fevers. Amongſt
thoſe and many other bad Effects of
this oily Conſtitution, there is one
Advantage that ſuch of them who
arrive to an advanc'd Age, are not
ſubject to the Stricture and Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Fibres, the Effect of old
Age.</p>
               <p>17. The Cauſes above mention'd
lead directly to the Cure; as it is the
Product of Gluttony and Lazineſs,
Exerciſe and Abſtinence is the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote;
it has been obſerv'd that a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh
Heat reſolves Fat, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what produceth this Effect in a
ſmall Degree ſo as not to endanger,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0412300600:223"/>
the Life of the Patient, muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
ſuch are all acrid and ſtimulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Subſtances. Salt, Pepper, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
Onions, Vinegar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> taken
in Quantities will produce a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Fever. Salt taken in great
Quantities will reduce an Animal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to the great Extremity of Aridity
or Dryneſs. The Ancients were ſo
ſenſible of the Force of Stimulating
in this Caſe, that the celebrated Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
againſt Fat was a certain Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the Vinegar of Squills taken
every Morning; for the ſame Reaſon,
ſaponaceous Subſtances, as Sugar,
Honey, the Juices of ripe Fruits, Pot
Herbs with Abſtinence from fat
Meat, and even an entire Milk-Diet
by its Thinneſs are very effectual.
Unfermented watery Liquors are hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
only as they relax, but on the other
hand Quantities of oily fermented
Liquors commonly increaſe the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.
All Things which promote the
Animal Secretions, eſpecially Sweat,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0412300600:224"/>
and inſenſible Perſpiration, and for
that Purpoſe even Water taken in
Quantities is ſometimes uſeful. Salts
mix'd with Fat harden it, and acid
Things congeal Oil; Spirit of Nitre
will turn Oil of Olives into a Sort
of fatty Subſtance; but Acids may be
us'd as ſtimulating. If acid Things
were us'd only as Coolers, they would
not be ſo proper in this Caſe, in
which it is neceſſary to keep up a
conſiderable Degree of Heat; but
for their foremention'd Qualities they
are ſtrongly indicated in the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory
Diſtempers of fat People,
where the Oil diſpoſeth to a rancid
Putrefaction; but Abſtinence being
the chief dietetick Method of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
or curing the Diſeaſe, leads
me to ſay ſomewhat of the Quantity
of Aliment in general.</p>
               <p>18. By <hi>Prop.</hi> VIII. <hi>Chap.</hi> II. The
frequent Repetition of Aliment is
neceſſary, not only for repairing the
Fluids and Solids, but to keep the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0412300600:225"/>
Fluids from the putreſcent alkaline
State, which they acquire by conſtant
Attrition without being diluted; from
whence it follows, <hi>Firſt</hi> That long
Abſtinence may be the Parent of
great Diſeaſes, eſpecially in hot bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Conſtitutions, and extremely
painful to acid Conſtitutions by the
uneaſy Senſation it creates in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Quantity
of Aliment neceſſary to keep the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
in a due State of Vigour ought
to be divided into Meals at proper
Intervals in the natural Day, by
which Method neither the chylopoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Organs, nor the Blood-Veſſels
are overcharg'd, nor the Juices de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
too long of freſh Recruits of
Chyle. <hi>Sanctorius</hi> confirms this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim
in his Doctrine of Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>19. The great Secret of Health
is keeping the Fluids in due Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Capacity and Strength of
the Channels through which they
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0412300600:226"/>
paſs; but the Danger is leſs when
the Quantity of the Fluid is too
ſmall; than when it is too great, for
a ſmaller Quantity of Fluid will paſs
where a larger cannot, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe.</p>
               <p>20. When the Quantity of the
Fluid is too ſmall, the elaſtick Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Canal (in which Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts)
exerts itſelf with too great a
Strength upon the Fluid. In which
Caſe there muſt follow too great a
Diſſipation of the Fluid, Dryneſs
and a gradual Decay. In too great
Repletion either the elaſtick Force
of the Tube is totally deſtroy'd; or
if it continue proportional to the
Degree of Extenſion like a Bow too
ſtrongly drawn, it throws the Fluid
with too great a projectile Force
forward through the Veſſels, and
back upon the Heart, and ſubjects
the Animal to all the Diſeaſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon a Plethory, and may
bring it into immediate Danger.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0412300600:227"/>
Therefore the Diſeaſes depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Repletion are more acute and
dangerous than thoſe that depend
upon the contrary State. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Longevity are chiefly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Abſtemious. Abſtinence
in Extremity will prove a mortal
Diſeaſe, but the Experiments of it
are very rare.</p>
               <p>21. Such as have an imperfect
Circulation through any Organ of
the Body, ſhould never charge their
Veſſels with too great a Quantity of
Chyle, this was obſerv'd <hi>Prop.</hi> II.
<hi>Chap.</hi> II. of the Lungs, and is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true in any other Caſe, as in Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aches,
which eating little relieves,
and eating and drinking much occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
A Senſation of Drouſineſs,
Oppreſſion, Heavineſs and Laſſitude
are Signs of a too plentiful Meal,
eſpecially in young People.</p>
               <p>22. The Meaſure of inſenſible
Perſpiration diſcover'd by weighing
is the beſt Rule of Diet; therefore
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0412300600:228"/>
in fat People the Uſe of vaporoſe or
perſpirable Food, and exerciſe (both
which increaſe Perſpiration) are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p>23. The Conſtitution of the Air
diſpoſeth the Inhabitants of one
Country more to be fat than that of
another. <hi>Sanctorius's</hi> Experiment of
Perſpiration being to the other Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions
as 5 to 3 does not hold in
this Country, except in the hotteſt
Time of Summer; ſo that the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Paduan</hi> Air in promoting Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
the whole Year round, is
equal to ours in the Month of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>24. From the foregoing Doctrine,
a common Caſe both of fat and lean
Men having great Stomachs may be
accounted for: by the laſt having a
great Perſpiration, and ſome of the
perſpirable Matter in the firſt not
ſufficiently attenuated, ſtopping at
the Surface of the Skin, and as it
were carried about him. Hunger is
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0412300600:229"/>
only a Warning of the Veſſels being
in ſuch a State of Vacuity as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a freſh Supply of Aliment, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Secretions, the Veſſels of the fat
and lean Man are equally empty; for
the Fat is as much out of the Thread
of Circulation as what is evaporated,
and perhaps the Fat in that Caſe
becomes like a morbid Excreſcence,
requiring a ſuperfluous Nutrition.</p>
               <p>25. Infants and old People ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
Abſtinence worſt. The firſt
from the Quantity of Aliment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
in Accretion, the laſt from
their Weakneſs, and the ſmall Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Aliment taken at once. The
Middle-aged ſupport it the beſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the oily Parts abounding in
the Blood.</p>
               <p>26. From the foregoing Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
follow naturally the Hippocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Rules of Diet in Fevers, of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more or leſs, more thick, or more
thin Aliment, according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen
time of the Duration of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0412300600:230"/>
for Example, in an Ephemera
none, becauſe of its Termination in
one Day, in a Fever of four Days
Duration leſs than in one of eight.
And as the Fever comes to its
Height ſtill ſubtracting from the
Quantity of Aliment, and making it
more diluent and thin.</p>
               <p>27. We come now to what we
may call the earthy or atrabilarian
Conſtitution, where the ſpirituous
and moſt fluid Parts of the Blood
are diſſipated, that is the Spirit, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and ſubtile Oil ſo much evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
as to leave the Salts, Earth,
and groſſer Oil in too great a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
The Blood grows darkiſh
and thick, ſuch a Conſtitution the
Ancients call'd Atrabilarian or melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick:
Melancholy, ſignifying in
<hi>Greek,</hi> black Gall; whether there be
any ſuch Humour as black Gall, is
only a Diſpute about Words. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
gave ſuch an Humour this
Name, and that is ſufficient; beſides
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0412300600:231"/>
it is matter of fact, that in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of this Diſeaſe, the Gall it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
will turn of a blackiſh Colour,
and the Blood verge towards a pitchy
Conſiſtence.</p>
               <p>28. The Signs of a Tendency to
ſuch a State, are Darkneſs or Lividi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Countenance, Dryneſs of
the Skin, Leanneſs, a penetrating
quick Genius, a ſlow Pulſe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.
The Cauſes of it are all
ſuch as expel the moſt volatile Parts
of the Blood, and fix the Reſidue:
Great Applications of the Mind to
one Object, either ſuch as produce
Sadneſs, or great Joy, both which
equally diſſipate the Spirits, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
Exerciſe in hot Air with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quench'd
Thirſt: Aliments of hard
Digeſtion, as dry'd and ſalted Fleſh,
unripe Fruits, farinaceous Subſtances
unfermented, and likewiſe immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Uſe of ſpirituous Liquors.</p>
               <p>The Effects of ſuch a vapid and
viſcous Conſtitution of Blood, are
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0412300600:232"/>
Stagnation, Obſtructions, Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
Putrefactions, Viſcidity, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Secretion of the Gall, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
Circulation, eſpecially in the
lateral Branches deſtined to ſeparate
the more fluid Parts, and therefore
viſcous, and ſparing Secretions in
the Glands: The Blood moving too
ſlowly through the celiack and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenterick
Arteries, produce various
Complaints in the lower Bowels and
Hypochondres; from whence ſuch
Perſons are call'd Hypochondriack:
Such as Senſation of Weight, Anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Repletion, a bad Digeſtion;
from whence different Kinds of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
acquire ſuch a State as they
affect of their own Nature, aceſcent,
if the Diet is of acid Vegetables,
and alkaline or nidoroſe, if of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Subſtances, eſpecially Fat, which
remains rancid ſo as the Spittle will
ſometimes flame in the Fire. This
Indigeſtion proceeds from the Inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
of the Gall, which likewiſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0412300600:233"/>
a Conſtipation of the Belly,
and a Difficulty of being purg'd.
The Urine is ſometimes limpid,
ſometimes thick, which latter is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a Sign of Recovery. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the Pituite in the lower
Belly, forceth it upon the ſalivary
Glands, and produceth Spitting.</p>
               <p>29. Such a State of the Fluids at
laſt affects the tender capillary Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of the Brain by the Viſcidity and
Immeability of the Matter impacted
in them, and diſorders the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and at laſt produceth Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
in the Bowels of the lower
Belly.</p>
               <p>30. It is plain, that the Removal
of ſuch a Diſeaſe is not to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
by active Remedies, any
more than a Thorn in the Fleſh, or
pitchy Matter adhering to a Thread
of Silk is to be taken away by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
what is viſcid, ought to be
gently attenuated, diluted and carried
off. That all Subſtances, which do
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0412300600:234"/>
heat, will ſtill diſſipate the fluid Parts
more, and conſequently increaſe the
Diſeaſe. Therefore Water impregnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſome penetrating Salt, is
found to have great Effects in this
Diſtemper. The Diet ought to be
oppoſite to the particular Acrimony,
whether acid or alkaline, which it is
eaſy to gueſs at by N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 5. of this
Propoſition. It ought to be demul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
in both Caſes light, and of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
Digeſtion, moiſtening and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of the Bile; of ſuch Nature are
vegetable Soaps, as Honey, and the
Juices of ripe Fruits, ſome of the
cooling, lacteſcent, papeſcent Plants,
as Cichory, Letuce, Dandelion, which
are found effectual in hot Countries.

               <p>To draw a few general Inferences
from the foregoing Doctrine.</p>
               <p>From the Doctrine of this ſhort
Eſſay, it is as eaſy to determine the
Rules of Diet in the different natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
States, as in the different morbid
States of a Human Body.</p>
               <p>1. By <hi>Prop.</hi> VII. <hi>Chap.</hi> II. Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Childhood demand thin co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
nouriſhing Aliment, ſuch as
lengthens their Fibres without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or hardening, becauſe of their
Weakneſs and State of Accretion.
Milk has all thoſe Qualities.</p>
               <p>2. By <hi>Prop.</hi> IV. <hi>Chap.</hi> II. The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity,
Quantity and Strength of the
Aliment is to be proportion'd to the
Labour or Quantity of muſcular
Motion, which in Youth is greater
than any other Age, upon which Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
a ſtrong and ſolid Diet would
ſeem to be indicated; but as that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0412300600:236"/>
Age is ſtill in a State of Accretion,
their Diet ought ſtill to be emollient,
and relaxing, copious, and without
Acrimony.</p>
               <p>3. The Diet of a Human Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
full grown, and in the State of
Manhood ought to be ſolid, with a
ſufficient Degree of Tenacity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Acrimony, their chief Drink Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cold, becauſe in ſuch a State it
has its own natural Spirit and Air,
(which Heat deſtroys) with a Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of fermented Liquors propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
to their natural Conſtitutions.</p>
               <p>4. The Courſe of the Fluids
through the vaſcular Solids, and the
common Animal Functions without
any Violence, muſt in length of
Time harden the Fibres, aboliſh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Canals, and make the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids
grow together; from whence
Dryneſs, Weakneſs, Immobility, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility

firſt and ſecond Digeſtion. Loſs of
Teeth, Depravation of Maſtication,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0412300600:237"/>
the Condition of old Age, which
therefore demands a Diet reſembling
that of Childhood often repeated, but
not ſo copious in Proportion to the
Bulk, emollient and diluting.</p>
               <p>5. From the Doctrine of the fifth
Chapter, it is likewiſe eaſy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the Inconveniences ariſing
from the Exceſs of any one ſort of
Diet. Too much Sea-ſalt produceth
Thirſt, Hoarſeneſs, Acrimony in the
Serum (which deſtroys its ſoft nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Quality) Eroſion of the ſmall
Fibres, Pains, and all the Symptoms
of the muriatick Scurvy.</p>
               <p>6. Acids taken in too great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities,
eſpecially ſuch as are auſtere,
as unripe Fruits, produce too great a
Stricture of the Fibres, incraſſate and
coagulate the Fluids; from whence

7. Spices in too great Quantities

quicken the Pulſe, and accelerate the
Motion of the Blood, diſſipate the
Fluids; from whence Leanneſs, Pains
in the Stomach, Loathings, and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
               <p>8. Strong Liquors, eſpecially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable
Spirits, taken in great
Quantities, intoxicate, conſtringe, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
dry, and ſtimulate the Fibres,
and coagulate the Fluids. They cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode
and deſtroy the inward Coat of
the Stomach and Inteſtines, and if
Digeſtion be a Putrefaction, Spirits

Obſtructions, eſpecially in

and Neceſſity of continuing the

Fermentation, as Muſt and new Ale,
are apt to produce Spaſms in the
Stomach, Cholick and Diarrhaeas.</p>
               <p>9. A Diet of viſcid Aliment creates
Flatulency and Crudities in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,

               <p>10. A Diet of oily Nouriſhment
relaxeth the Solids, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

(Monks who take a great deal of Oil
are ſubject to inteſtinal Hernias) it
creates nidoroſe Eructations, Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,

11. A conſtant Adherence to one
ſort of Diet, may have bad Effects
on any Conſtitution. Nature has
provided a great Variety of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
for Human Creatures, and
furniſh'd us with Appetites to deſire,
and Organs to digeſt them (there is
a moſt curious Bill of Fair in Sir
<hi>Hans Sloan's</hi> Natural Hiſtory of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica)</hi>
as Aliments have different
Qualities; a conſtant Adherence to
one Sort, may make the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
verge to ſome of the Extremes
mention'd in this Chapter; for heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
People, <hi>Celſus's</hi> Rule I. Chap. I.
is a good one, <hi>Sanus homo qui bene
valet &amp; ſuae ſpontis eſt, nullis obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
ſe Legibus debet, nullum cibi genus
fugere quo populus utitur, interdum in
couvivio eſſe, interdum ab eo ſe abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,
modo plus, modo amplius aſſumere,</hi>
&amp;c. The Senſe of the whole Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
is, That a healthy Man under
his own Government, ought not to tie
himſelf up to ſtrict Rules, nor to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0412300600:241"/>
from any ſort of Food in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Uſe, that he ought ſometimes
to feaſt, ſometimes to faſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to ſleep, ſometimes to watch
more than ordinary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring
Regularity is almoſt impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
and the ſwerving from it,
when it is grown habitual, dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
for every unuſual thing in a
Human Body becomes a Stimulus,
as Wine, or Fleſh-Meat to one not
us'd to them; therefore <hi>Celſus's</hi> Rule
with the proper moral Reſtrictions,
is a good one for People in Health,
and even in Perſons diſeas'd in any
of the Senſes of this Chapter, as too
ſtrict, too lax, acid and bilious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
A conſtant Adherence to one Sort of
Diet, may carry the Caſe beyond a
Cure to the contrary Extreme.</p>
               <p>12. General Rules about Diet,
without Regard to particular Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
are abſurd.</p>
               <p>13. That with regard to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Conſtitutions, the common Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0412300600:242"/>
of Diet into Vegetable
with Water, and Animal with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
Liquors, is not proper and
compleat. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeration
of Conſtitutions in this
Chapter, there is not one that can
be limited and reſtricted by ſuch a
Diſtinction, nor can perhaps the
ſame Perſon in different Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
be properly confin'd to one or
the other. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable
Diet is not characteriz'd, there
is not a general alimentary Quality
in which all Vegetables agree; there
are Vegetables, acid, alkaline, cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
hot, relaxing, aſtringent, acrid,
and mild, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Uſeful or hurtful, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the different Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to which they are apply'd, there
may be a ſtronger Broth made of
Vegetables than any Gravy-ſoup.</p>
               <p>14. As Fleſh-Diet is generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaleſcent,
and many Vegetables are
acid and cooling; People of hot bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Conſtitutions find themſelves
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0412300600:243"/>
extremely well in a vegetable Diet
and Water, and the ſame Perſons
perhaps had enjoy'd their Health as
well with a Mixture of Animal Diet
qualify'd with a ſufficient Quantity of
Aceſcents, as Bread, Vinegar, and
fermented Liquors.</p>
               <p>15. The Oil of moſt Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
in which their nutritious Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
chiefly conſiſts, ſeems not to
be ſo hard of Digeſtion as that of
Animals; fat Meat is harder to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
than the moſt oily Plant taken
as Aliment: Sick People could not
take ſo great a Quantity of melted
Fat, as they can of Oil of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds.</p>
               <p>16. Animal Subſtances are more
nouriſhing, and more eaſily tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
into Animal Juices, than Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and therefore a vegetable Diet
is more proper for ſome Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as being leſs nouriſhing.</p>
               <p>17. As the Qualities of Plants are
more various than thoſe of Animal
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0412300600:244"/>
Subſtances, a Diet of ſome Sorts of
Vegetables may be more effectual in
the Cure of ſome chronical Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
than an Animal Diet.</p>
               <p>18. The fibrous or vaſcular Parts
of Vegetables ſeem ſcarce changeable
in the Alimentary Duct. The Dung
of Horſes is nothing but the Fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Hay, and as ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible.</p>
               <p>19. Vegetables abound more with
aerial Particles, than Animal Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and therefore are more flatulent.</p>
               <p>20. Man is by his Frame as well
as his Appetite a carnivorous Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal;
the Inſtruments of Digeſtion
are ſo well adapted to the proper
Food of each Animal, that from the
Structure of the Firſt, it is eaſy to
gueſs at the Second. Moſt Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes
that live upon Herbs, have
inciſor Teeth to pluck and divide
them: after they are ſwallow'd, they
are brought up again from one Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
to receive a new Alteration
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0412300600:245"/>
by a ſecond Maſtication, after that
the Maſs ſo prepar'd, paſſeth through
four Stomachs of different Figures
and Structure before it comes into
the Inteſtines. This is the Caſe of
ruminating Animals, except ſome
few; as of Hares who have but one
Stomach, by which it appears, that
Nature is at a great deal of Labour
to tranſmute Vegetable into Animal
Subſtances: Therefore Herb-eating
Animals, which don't ruminate, have
ſtrong Grinders, and chew much.
There have been ſeveral Inſtances of
ruminating Men, and that Quality
leaving them, was a Symptom of
approaching Sickneſs, Vid. <hi>Philoſoph.
Tranſact. &amp; Bonet. Sepulchret. Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</hi>
Granivorous Birds have the
Mechaniſm of a Mill, their Maw is
the Happer, which holds and ſoftens
the Grain, letting it drop by Degrees
into the Stomach where it is ground
by two ſtrong Muſcles, in which
Action they are aſſiſted by ſmall
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0412300600:246"/>
Stones which they ſwallow for the
Purpoſe, and becauſe this Action of
Grinding; cannot be perform'd by
the weaker Stomachs of their Young;
many of them, as Pigeons, half di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
the Aliment before they give it.
Some Birds that live upon Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
eaſily diſſolvable, as Worms,
Eggs, have the Coats of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs
ſmooth; as Cuckows. Birds
of Prey that live upon Animal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
have membranaceous not
muſcular Stomachs.</p>
               <p>The beſt Inſtruments for dividing
of Herbs are inciſor Teeth; for crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of hard Subſtances, as Bones
and Nuts; Grinders or Mill-Teeth;
for dividing of Fleſh; ſharp-pointed
or Dog-Teeth, which ſeem to be ſo
neceſſary for that Purpoſe, that an
Eagle has ſuch Teeth not in his Bill,
but two at the Root of his Tongue
to hold his Prey, and three Rows in
his Jaws at the Entry of his Gullet.
A Human Creature has all the three
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0412300600:247"/>
Sorts of Teeth; the Teeth and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs
of ſome carnivorous Beaſts,
don't differ much from the Human.
A Lion has generally fourteen in
each Jaw; four Inciſors, four Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine,
and ſix Grinders, ſharpiſh, for
dividing of Fleſh as well as cracking
of Bones. A Human Creature has
commonly ſixteen Teeth in each
Jaw, two of them only Canine.
The inward Coat of a Lion's Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
has ſtronger Folds than a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
but in other Things not much
different. The Stomachs of Water-Fowl
that live upon Fiſh are Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
therefore it ſeems that Nature
has provided Human Creatures with
Inſtruments to prepare and digeſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all Sorts of alimentary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
as Herbs, Grain, Nuts, by
the Structure of their Parts as well
as Appetites, they are plainly carni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorous.</p>
               <p>21. It has been objected againſt
this Doctrine, that Granivorous
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0412300600:248"/>
Animals have a long Colon and a
Caecum which in Carnivorous are
wanting. Now it is well known
that a Man has both, Vid. <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Tranſactions;</hi> to this it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
that the Obſervation is not
true without Exceptions; many car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivorous
Animals have neither Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
nor Caecum, and many Grani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorous
have both. There are Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
not carnivorous that have a
large Caecum and no Colon, and
others that have neither.</p>
               <p>There are carnivorous Animals, I
mean ſuch as eat Fleſh ſometimes,
that have both Colon and Caecum;
but as the Obſervation is generally
true, it proves at leaſt that Mankind
is deſign'd to take vegetable Food
ſometimes, and it is a freſh Inſtance
of Nature's being at more Labour to
aſſimilate Vegetable into Animal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
by affording them a longer
and more retarded Paſſage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0412300600:249"/>
22. Carnivorous Animals have
more Courage, muſcular Strength,
Activity in Proportion to their Bulk,
which is evident by comparing the
Cat-Kind, as Lions, Tigers; and
likewiſe the Dog-Kind with Herb
eating Animals of the ſame Bulk.
Birds of Prey excell Granivorous, in
Strength and Courage. I know more
than one Inſtance of iraſcible Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
being much ſubdu'd by a vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Diet.</p>
               <p>23. Fermented Liquors are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and perhaps neceſſary for ſuch
as live upon an Animal Diet; for
Fleſh without being qualify'd with
Acids, as Bread, Vinegar, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
Liquors, is too alkaleſcent a
Diet; and Wine moderately taken,
rather qualifies the Heat of Animal
Food than increaſeth it. Water is
the only Diluter, and the beſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent
of moſt of the Ingredients
of our Aliment. It is found by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that Water digeſteth a full
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0412300600:250"/>
Meale, ſooner than any other Liquor;
but as it relaxeth, the conſtant Uſe
of it, may hurt ſome Conſtitutions.
As it contains no Acid, it is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
with a Diet that is entirely Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcent.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine laid down in this
<hi>Eſſay,</hi> is in moſt Particulars (I do
not ſay in all) conform to that of
the divine <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> as appears
by ſeveral Paſſages of his Works;
particularly of his Books of Diet,
of his Method of Diet in acute Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
and <hi>Galen's</hi> Commentaries both
upon thoſe Books, and ſome others
of his Works. I ſhall inſtance in
ſome few Particulars as far as relates
to that Part of Diet call'd Aliment,
without refering to the Editions,
Books and Pages, which would be
of ſmall Uſe to my Readers. The
Maxims of this great Man are, That
Health depends chiefly upon the
Choice of Aliment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0412300600:251"/>
That the Phyſicians before his
Time were to be blam'd, for not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
Rules of Diet.</p>
               <p>That he who would skilfully treat
the Subject of Aliment, muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Nature of Man, the Nature
of Aliments, and the Conſtitution
of the Perſon who takes them.</p>
               <p>In his Books of Diet, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
the Qualities of all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
which Mankind generally feed
upon.</p>
               <p>As of all Sorts of Fleſh, many of
which are not in Uſe amongſt us,
as of Dogs, Foxes, Aſſes, Horſes.</p>
               <p>That the Fleſh of Wild Animals
is dryer than that of Tame, of Stall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed,
than of thoſe fed by Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
               <p>That the Fleſh of Animals, in the
Vigor of their Age, and of ſuch as
are caſtrated, is beſt.</p>
               <p>That of Animals, which have not
us'd hard Labour, is tendereſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0412300600:252"/>
That Beef is bilious that is alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcent,
as all Fleſh Meat is.</p>
               <p>That the Fleſh of hot dry Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
is moſt nouriſhing.</p>
               <p>He is very particular as to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Cookery, that Roaſting deſtroys
the Humidity.</p>
               <p>That ſalted Fleſh ſhould be mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
and moiſten'd.</p>
               <p>That ſalted Fleſh dries, attenuates,
and moves the Belly.</p>
               <p>He is likewiſe very curious in
tempering the Qualities of his Meats,
by Seaſonings of contrary Qualities.</p>
               <p>He deſcribes the Qualities of the
Fleſh of moſt Sorts of Fowl, that
the Fleſh of granivorous Birds is not
ſo moiſt and oily as that of Ducks;
he is particular as to the Qualities
of Fiſhes freſh and ſalted, and of all
Vegetables both Alimentary and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal;
that Onions, Leeks, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are hot and acrimonious,
that ſome of them, as Muſtard, and
Creſſes, will occaſion a Diſury; that
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0412300600:253"/>
others as Letuce, are cooling and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing;
Selery, diuretick; Mint, hot;
that the Cabbage Kind reſolve the
Bile, that ſuch Herbs as are odorous
are Heating, Legumes are flatulent,
ripe Fruits laxative, and unripe, aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
               <p>That unripe Cucumbers are hard
of Digeſtion.</p>
               <p>That the Fruits of the Earth in
hot Countries, are dryer and hotter
than in cold.</p>
               <p>He is no leſs exact in deſcribing
the Qualities of Milk, Whey, all
Sorts of Bread and Water, which he
chooſes clear, light, without Taſte or
Smell, drawn not from Snow, but
from Springs with an Eaſterly Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;
tho' he ſeems to have known
ſomething of Mineral Waters, he ſays
nothing of the Uſe of them.</p>
               <p>He is no leſs accurate in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the Qualities of ſeveral
Sorts of Wines, black, white, auſtere,
oily, thin, with the proper Uſes of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0412300600:254"/>
them, by which it appears, that
Wine was ſeldom or never drunk in
his Country without Water. He
allows Wine unmix'd after great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipations
of the Spirits by Fatigue,
and regulates the Quantities of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Seaſons.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe conſider'd the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal
Qualities of Aliments, and tells
you, that of Aliments ſome are laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
ſome moiſten, ſome dry, ſome
bind, ſome move Urine.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Qualities which he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
to alimentary Subſtances, are
the four in common Uſe amongſt
the Ancients, as hot, cold, moiſt,
and dry; according to thoſe, his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are often very juſt and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and nothing can be more ſo
than what follows, that acid, acrid,
auſtere and bitter Subſtances do not
nouriſh; but by their Aſtringency
create Horror, that is, ſtimulate the
Fibres; that ſweet, oily and fat Things
are nouriſhing and anodyne, that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0412300600:255"/>
dilutes and cools, than Honey
is detergent, and Vinegar profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to bilious Conſtitutions: No leſs
judicious are his Intentions in the
Cure of Diſeaſes by Aliment.</p>
               <p>That Diſeaſes depend on the Parts
contain'd, and the Parts containing,
that is, on the Fluids and Solids.</p>
               <p>That the ſolid Parts were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax'd
or aſtricted as they let the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
paſs, either in too ſmall or too
great Quantities.</p>
               <p>That Animals conſiſt of Fire and
Water, which Diviſion is not ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat
as one may imagine; for
by Water he ſeems to underſtand the
unactive, and even the ſolid Parts,
and by Fire all the volatile and active
Parts, and that the difference of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
conſiſts in the Exceſs or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of theſe Principles, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
the due Mixture of them to a
Sort of Harmony.</p>
               <p>That there are in a Human Body
Bitter, Salt, Sweet, Acrid and Inſipid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0412300600:256"/>
That Contraries are the Remedies
of their Contraries.</p>
               <p>That Health conſiſts in a due Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion

and gives a Reaſon for it
conformable to the Principles laid

               <p>That a Man cannot be healthy
and digeſt his Aliment without La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and that the Quantity and

Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> obſerves, that Paleneſs
is the Effect of Acidity.</p>
               <p>That the Choice of Diet ſhould
be according to the difference of
Conſtitutions, as in phlegmatick
Conſtitutions, Fiſh and Fleſh well
ſeaſon'd: The Fleſh of Fowls (which
is an alkaleſcent Diet) not many
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0412300600:258"/>
Vegetables, black auſtere Wines. In
dry Temperaments, lenitive Fruits,
Figs, Raiſins, and ſoft Wines. In
ſuch as have a bad Digeſtion, and
moiſt Bellies (the Caſe of acid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions)
the Fleſh of Fowl, which
is a Diet both alkaleſcent and of eaſy
Digeſtion; for ſuch as have dry Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
Pot-Herbs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> his Commentator tells you,
that bitter Subſtances engender Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
and burn the Blood, giving no
general Nouriſhment to the whole;
howſoever they may be acceptable
to ſome one Part, that is (according
to what was ſaid in this <hi>Eſſay</hi>) that
they are a Sort of ſubſidiary Gall:
And again, ſharp Spices are moſt
unfit for tender Bodies, whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is eaſily melted and inflam'd.
However, ſtrong Men may eat them
with groſs Meats, and conſequently
by the Principles of the <hi>Eſſay;</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by their melting Quality are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for fat People: Meats over-ſalted
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0412300600:259"/>
are dangerous: Inflammations, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſies,
Sharpneſs of Urine, and
great Obſtructions happening to ſuch
as uſe them much, agreeing with
none but ſtrong Bodies, as Sailers,
Soldiers, and Husband Men, accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd
to hard Labour, and much
Toiling.</p>
               <p>Fat Meats are not good but for
dry Stomachs; for in ſanguine and
cholerick Stomachs, they are ſoon
corrupted; in phlegmatick Stomachs,
they procure Looſeneſs, and hinder
Retention.</p>
               <p>When any Man is ſick or diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd,
let his Meats be of contrary
Qualities to his Diſeaſe; for Health
itſelf is but a Kind of Temper got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and preſerv'd by a convenient
Mixture of Contrarieties. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in Fevers the Aliments preſcrib'd
by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> were Ptiſans and
Cream of Barley. Decoctions of
ſome Vegetables likewiſe with the
Mixture of ſome acid, Hydromel,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0412300600:260"/>
that is, Honey and Water, Oxymel,
Honey and Vinegar, then Wines
without Flavour diluted with Water,
when there was no Tendency to a
<hi>Dilirium.</hi> Water, Vinegar and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in Pleuriſies and Inflammations
of the Lungs. Sometimes he mixeth
Spices, which ſeems odd; but that
muſt have been for promoting Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration;
and even in Ulcers of
the Lungs, he preſcribes Fat and Salt
for the ſame Purpoſe; and to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
troubled with Pains after Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing,
he mixeth his Ptiſan with
Leeks and Fat; which Practice no
doubt he had found ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>He preſcribes great Quantities of
Aſſes Milk as far as an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
in proper Caſes, eſpecially as a
Reſtorative; and to ſuch as had hot,
dry Conſtitutions, Aſſes Milk, Whey
and Abſtinence from Fat and Oil.</p>
               <p>No leſs judicious are his general
Maxims for preſerving of Health.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0412300600:261"/>
A Diet moderate in Quantity with
a due Degree of Exerciſe.</p>
               <p>That ſuch as are of hot Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſhould abſtain from violent
Exerciſes, uſe Bathing in hot Water,
rather than Unctions, feed upon Maize
(which is his favourite Food) and Pot
Herbs.</p>
               <p>That one muſt not accuſtome one's
ſelf to a too regular Diet, becauſe
the leaſt Error is dangerous.</p>
               <p>That all ſudden Alterations in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes,
either of Repletion, Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Heat or Cold are dangerous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaking the Mind of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi>
tells us, That the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of Body may be chang'd
by Diet.</p>
               <p>That we ſhould take thoſe Kinds
of Meats which are beſt for our
own particular Bodies for our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Age, Temperature, Diſtempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Complexions; for as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular Member of the Body is
nouriſh'd with a ſeveral qualify'd
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0412300600:262"/>
Juice; ſo Labourers, and idle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
Children and Striplings, old
Men and young Men, cold and hot
Bodies, phlegmatick and cholerick
Complexions muſt have diverſe Diets.
It is eaſy to produce a great many
more Inſtances to prove the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of the Doctrine of the <hi>Eſſay,</hi>
with the Notions and Practice of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates;</hi>
but thoſe already mention'd
are ſufficient, and may be of uſe to
ſome Readers to confirm by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
what they will not be at the
Trouble to deduce by Reaſoning.</p>
