            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER, &amp;c</head>
            <p>I GUESS Buſineſs has prevented your calling on me, for ſome time paſt, as I know you do not want good Nature; beſides, I am certain you had me in your Mind, having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed you were kind enough to ſpeak in my behalf, when my Character was attacked by a <hi>low Fellow,</hi> who <hi>unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> bears the <hi>Name</hi> of a <hi>Comedian,</hi> becauſe during a Dearth of decent Performers, he is ſuffered unnoticed to murder many a Part, to the Reproach of our preſent ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rile Stage, while he modeſtly miſconſtrues the <hi>Forbearance</hi> of the <hi>Town</hi> into an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation:</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0163702400:5"/>
This Slanderer, whoſe Soul is darker than his duſky Countenance, which often dingily degrades a genteel Comedy, by his diſgraceful Appearance, has, as I am well informed, been very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy in propagating ſome Falſhoods to my Prejudice, at this moſt unpardonable Juncture, when I can't come Abroad to give him an Anſwer, if he were worthy one.</p>
            <p>If his Mind had the leaſt Tincture of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> (a Name which, indeed, neither his Birth, Education, or Morals give him the leaſt Pretenſions to) he would know, that now to utter even a ſevere Truth, were an Act of Inhumanity; and that to indulge Spleen againſt the Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, is as baſe as cowardly ſtriking the Proſtate. What he may be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſay of me as an Actor, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully deſpicable; I have too proper a Contempt for his Mock-Judgment, not to conſider his Diſapprobation as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment; and muſt imagine any one of True Taſte would regard his Praiſe as the ſevereſt Satire.</p>
            <p>Were I diſpoſed to throw away my Time in Drawing this Notorious Man at full Length, and Paint him in his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0163702400:6"/>
proper Colours (which I may poſſibly be provoked to, if he does not learn to reſtrain his Fibbing Tongue) I could exhibit to View a Monſter, which every one but his ſcurvy ſelf would ſtart at: I ſhould have held him quite beneath my Notice, as is all he utters, but that the Appetite of Slander, in many, is too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant; and, 'tis poſſible, when the filthieſt Fellow throws a Profuſion of Dirt, ſome may chance to ſtick, if not timely thrown off; I ſhall endeavour therefore, to wipe away the ſooty Smears of this Chimney-ſweeper, by relating a ſimple Fact, which will, I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, amply confute the malicious Tales of this unprovoked, rancorous Mortal:—I ſay unprovoked, for I am not conſcious I was ever guilty of an Injury towards him in Thought, Word, or Deed; and as this Viperous Gnatho has ever, to my Face, affected to be my Friend, his Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting appears the more ſurpriſingly inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſhocking. Why this bad Man has thus endeavoured to blacken me I ſhould not readily have been able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for, had not the entertaining <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector</hi> furniſhed me with the following Paragraph, in his Eſſay on Detraction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0163702400:7"/>
               <q>One would imagine by the Spirit and eager Pleaſure with which Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are raiſed and propagated, that Men ſuppoſed they obtained into their own Poſſeſſion all thoſe good Qualities, of the Credit of which they robbed another: With thoſe who are warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Practice, ſomething like this is perhaps the Caſe. Virtue they place in no Eſteem farther than as an Article of Reputation; and in this they ſee it only as owing its Luſtre to Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon: They feel a thouſand Obſtacles to raiſing themſelves up to the Level of thoſe whom they envy; but they ſee the ſame End is to be anſwered by bringing them down to theirs: If they cannot add to the Merchandiſe in one Scale, they will ſteal away the Weights from the other, and the Balance will this Way alſo appear equal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let me add a Line or two more from that Writer, which ſeem <hi>apropos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He who is himſelf abandoned, and has not Virtue to inſpire a Reſolution of reclaiming, will ſnatch at every Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Scandal in another, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0163702400:8"/>
he will urge it as a Proof, that all Mankind are like him, only that they are Hypocrites.</q>
            </p>
            <p>While I am expreſſing my <hi>Contempt</hi> and <hi>Deteſtation</hi> of this <hi>Detractor,</hi> let me confeſs my Obligation to Mr. MACK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIN, who, I underſtand, was candid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, in my Abſence, to contradict, on his own Knowledge, ſome of the Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der uttered againſt me; This he is the more praiſe-worthy for, and the Act more particularly merits my Regard as there was not any ſtrong Intimacy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting between us:—Be ſo good, to make my Compliments to him, and let him know, <hi>I have a grateful Senſe of his Behaviour to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are other <hi>Chatterers</hi> in a Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-Houſe, I am told, <hi>"who, like to Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage-Curs, bark when their Fellows do,"</hi> The moſt of theſe are the mere <hi>Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots</hi> of a <hi>Theatre,</hi> who juſt ſerve to fill up the <hi>Muſter-Roll</hi> of a <hi>Company;</hi> NAMES that now and then <hi>clutter up</hi> a <hi>Play-Bill,</hi> with as little Significancy as ROE and DOE in a <hi>Writ,</hi> or JOHN A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOKES and TOM A-STILES in a <hi>Law Caſe:</hi> When you hear any of 'em

mentioned, you no more annex the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea of an Actor to the Names of the former, than you do to the latter the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea of any one Breathing: Might not one cry out, with FALSTAEF, when they are ſeen or mentioned<hi>—I am a Rogue if I am not aſhamed of my Company!—</hi>Theſe are a Kind of Parrots, who fancy they entertain, while their Prating is but the Peſt of the Public Society; yet they will be heard, though they are more diſturbing to a rational Converſation, than the pert and noiſy Chirpings of caged Birds in a ſmall Room, on a ſun-ſhiny Day.—Among theſe may be one or two, perhaps, who, by a lucky Hit in ſome farcical Extravaganza, with Buffoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery and Impudence, (which with the Million, too frequently paſs for Humour and Spirit) ſans Judgment, or Genius, gain the Applauſe of a Day, and then deem themſelves Actors; much as ſome modern Metre-mongers, from the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of a ſlight Sonnet (ſung with univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Applauſe, forſooth, at <hi>Sadlers-Wells)</hi> aſſume the Character of Poets.</p>

                  <hi>See the</hi> Appendix, p. 18.</note> to that I refer you, as far as relates to Stage Affairs:—As to my Conduct off the Stage: I may affirm I lived reputably, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently; and my Mind being more at Eaſe while I was there for three Years, than it had been for a long time before, I know of No Irregularities I gave way
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0163702400:11"/>
to there, that could either bring Shame to myſelf, or cauſe my Friends to bluſh for me.</p>
            <p>I remained in <hi>Dublin</hi> a Fortnight af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Theatre was cloſed, and my Contract with the Manager was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: I always openly declared I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for <hi>London</hi> in the Summer—But ſome private Buſineſs calling me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſooner than I expected, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd a Friend to pay any Debts I might accidentally have forgot; and immediately after my Sailing, an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement was publiſhed, and continued to that Effect, for ſeveral Days, in ES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAL's NEWS LETTER, of which I have ſome in Poſſeſſion to produce, if requiſite: And now, I think, I may fairly aver, there is No one Perſon there has any Demand upon me.</p>
            <p>But now to return to <hi>Liverpool:—</hi>That I was, two Years ſince, arreſted at <hi>Liverpool,</hi> is certain;—A Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman there paſſed his Word for my Appearance;—This he was the more inclineable to do, as He knew the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Plaintiff was not the Beſt of Men; and had Reaſon to believe the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0163702400:12"/>
Debt was honeſtly diſputable:—I yielded myſelf to the Attorney the next Day:—The Gentleman knowing how much the Benefits (for I was then acting in a Company there) depended on my Performance (and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured friend of his having one come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on) continued his Security to the Attorney:—Some Time after, I came Poſt to <hi>London,</hi> in order to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a Bill in Chancery, which I was preparing to juſtify myſelf. And the Opening of the Theatre in <hi>Dublin,</hi> to which I was engaged, was ſo near at Hand, being pinched in Time, I was under a Neceſſity of getting thither as faſt as poſſible.</p>
            <p>In the Interim a <hi>Reſponſible Friend</hi> of <hi>mine</hi> gave the Gentleman at <hi>Liverpool</hi> a <hi>Satisfactory Counter Security.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had Things turned out ever ſo Bad (as who can anſwer for Law Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) the Gentleman at <hi>Liverpool</hi> could not ſuffer: But the Plaintiff dying, the Affair was at an End—And nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one, nor t'other of the Securities ever did, or can ſuſtain any Damage.</p>

            <p>AS I have ſome Buſineſs that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains me here longer than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected; I ſhall now give you an Epiſtolary Account of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, which I propoſed to have reſerved as a Topic of Converſation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0163702400:18"/>
Know then, I have ſtill continued a conſtant Play-Hunter, and have found my Time not miſ-employed; I ever thought Plays the moſt rational, as well as the moſt agreeable Amuſement; and the Company of the Theatre Royal in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> is well worthy of Encouragement: The numerous and polite Audiences they have had this Seaſon, ſhew the whole Town are of my Mind. We have two Theatres here, but they are both rented by one Perſon. That in <hi>Aungier-ſtreet,</hi> has the largeſt and loftieſt Stage; but not being ſo conveniently ſituated for the Town in general, is rarely uſed, unleſs for Aſſemblies, a Dramatic Opera, or now and then a Play. That in <hi>Smock-Alley</hi> is chiefly for Plays. It is a compleat pretty Houſe, not ſo large as thoſe of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> conſequently the Decorations cannot be ſo magnificent; but the Scenes are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry decent, and the Habits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> extremely handſome.</p>
            <p>The Performances are various, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly conducted (no Perſon whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted behind the Scenes) Mr. SHERIDAN is the chief Director, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits the Encouragement of the Public for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0163702400:19"/>
his Abilities as an Actor; particularly in the Characters of HORATIO in the <hi>Fair Penitent,</hi> MACBETH, HAMLET, and CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIOLANUS. They perform near twice the Number of Plays here, to what they do in <hi>London;</hi> and act near as many Nights, tho' their Company is not near ſo large in Number. Some Plays have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated a dozen Times in the Seaſon to very crowded Audiences, particularly the <hi>Provoked Husband,</hi> the <hi>Trip to the Jubilee,</hi> and the <hi>Nonjuror;</hi> the <hi>Relapſe, Sir Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Flutter,</hi> the <hi>Careleſs Husband,</hi> the <hi>Double Dealer,</hi> the <hi>Diſtreſt Mother, King John, Jane Shore,</hi> the <hi>Mourning Bride,</hi> and <hi>Henry the 8th,</hi> have been often acted, which is greatly owing to the inimitable Performance of Mrs. WOFFINGTON, who charms all (but chiefly the Judicious) in the Characters of <hi>Lady Townly, Sir H. Wildair,</hi> and <hi>Maria;</hi> this laſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Part is, I think, one of the higheſt drawn Characters in Comedy, and ſhe does the excellent Author Juſtice; nor is the Succeſs of the <hi>Nonjuror</hi> a little owing to the maſterly Performance of Mr. CIB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BER, who ſupports the Character of Dr. <hi>Wolf</hi> throughout, with a drole Dignity, a prieſtly Pride, inſinuating Cunning, and affected Humility, as marks the Character
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0163702400:20"/>
with true Humour, Spirit, and Propriety; and ſhews him a juſt Comedian. Theſe two Comedians in moſt of their Parts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel others; but in theſe they may be ſaid to excel themſelves.—I always eſteemed him a good Actor, but had not ſeen him act ſince the Beginning of 1749, when he appeared not in ſuch perfect Health as he ſeems now to enjoy, with a happy Flow of Spirits. He has this laſt Winter given great Delight in the ſeveral Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Lord Foppington, Sir Fopling Flutter, Sir Francis Wronghead, Beau Clincher, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius, Scrub, Sir Paul Pliant, Clodio, Don Manuel, Barnaby Brittle, Gomez, Abel Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, &amp;c.</hi> in all which he ſhew'd a thorough Knowledge of Life, and an unconfined Genius; he purſues Nature, and plays them with admirable Variety.</p>
            <p>Were I to expatiate on the various Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the three before-mentioned Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, I ſhould ſend you a Pamphlet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of an Epiſtle, ſo ſhall only add, that the Contention here concerning WOF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FINGTON has been wherein ſhe ſhone moſt; whether in Tragedy or Comedy. She's great in both, but the latter gives her an Opportunity of ſhewing the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Variety; and ſhe's ſo much a Miſtreſs of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0163702400:21"/>
her Profeſſion, 'tis ſcarce eaſy to determine what Caſt of Parts moſt properly belong to her; ſince I have beheld her with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Admiration, as a <hi>Jane Shore,</hi> an <hi>Hermione,</hi> and <hi>Andromache,</hi> a <hi>Conſtance,</hi> a <hi>Lady Betty Modiſh,</hi> and a <hi>Lady Pliant,</hi> in the Space of a few Weeks. Mr. SHERI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAN is excellent in <hi>Maſkwell,</hi> and CIB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BER and WOFFINGTON are highly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in the drole Characters of <hi>Sir Paul</hi> and <hi>Lady Phant.</hi> Tho' my Paper is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt full, and your Patience, I doubt not, well nigh tired, I muſt mention her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Performance in <hi>Phoedra.</hi> Her Attitudes were gracefully pictureſque, juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adapted to her various Deſcriptions and Paſſions; None ſeem'd forced or ſtudied: Her Countenance was equally expreſſive, and ſhe ſo well managed her Voice, ſhe neither wanted Power or Variety through the whole Part. Her <hi>Queen Catherine</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in <hi>Henry the 8th,</hi> and <hi>Volumnia</hi> in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolanus</hi> were fine Performances. Nor can I decline giving Praiſe to CIBBER in the Character of <hi>Wolſey,</hi> which he performed at his ſecond Benefit (the principal Actors here have two each, in one Seaſon) to a vaſt Audience, with deſerved Applauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0163702400:22"/>
To conclude: Of the three Performers I have here mention'd, I think, may be juſtly ſaid, (what a late celebrated Writer obſerved of one of them) <q>Judiciouſly conſidered in their various Lights, they are but barely received as they deſerve, when the Audience appears moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to them.</q>
