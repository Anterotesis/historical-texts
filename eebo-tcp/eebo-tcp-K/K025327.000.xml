            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>One morning, when I was ſauntering in the foreſt, habited in a looſe white ſack, with my walking-crook in my hand—poor Lord Autumn uſed to ſay I looked like a nymph in this dreſs—I found myſelf fatigued, and was obliged to reſt under a tree.—Here I ſat, or rather reclined, in a penſive attitude, when I was rouſed by the ſight of a monſtrous ſnake, that had faſtened on my arm—</p>

                     <p>Do!—I ſcreamed ſo loud, that two young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who were walking at a little diſtance, came running to me:—both were eager to aſſiſt me;— but Mr. Freeman's aſſiduity was ſo animated, ſo languiſhing—ſo—ſo—in ſhort, the blow was ſtruck; I perceived immediately that I had made a violent impreſſion.</p>

                     <p>The ſnake!—O, I was miſtaken: it was only a caterpillar, which my fears had magnified into a ſnake. Mr. Freeman then offered me his hand, to lead me home; but it was with ſuch a timid aſpect!—Since that day, his friend Belmour and he have been conſtant viſitors at my houſe; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his paſſion has been continually increaſing, yet he has concealed it ſo carefully, that no perſon in the family has diſcovered it but myſelf.</p>

Perfidious Courtney! it is too plain he has ſupplanted me, baſely ſupplanted me; and the ſtory he has told me of his ſiſter was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to excuſe his ſudden abſence.

wiſhes, may appear ſelf-intereſted; but, if my ſiſter continues to maintain thoſe ſentiments ſhe has this day manifeſted, the rectitude of her heart will, in ſome meaſure, atone for the inferiority of her rank and fortune. As for me, though perhaps I have proved myſelf rather too young to be your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, I am yet old enough to be your friend, and ſhall ever be proud of that diſtinction, not from the conſideration of your wealth and honour; but becauſe I am convinced that you want neither example, nor precept to inſtruct you, that there are no characters ſo truly noble, as that of a woman of virtue, and a man of real honour.</p>

               <l>WHAT! five long acts—and all to make us wiſer!</l>
               <l>Our authoreſs ſure has wanted an adviſer.</l>
               <l>Had ſhe conſulted <hi>me,</hi> ſhe ſhould have made</l>
               <l>Her moral play a ſpeaking maſquerade.</l>
               <l>Warm'd up each buſtling ſcene, and in her rage</l>

               <l>My life on't, this had kept her play from ſinking,</l>
               <l>Have pleas'd our eyes, and ſav'd the pain of thinking.</l>
               <l>Well, ſince ſhe thus has ſhewn her want of ſkill,</l>
               <l>What if I give a maſquerade? I will.</l>
               <l>But how! ay, there's the rub!
<stage>(pauſing)</stage>
I've got my cue:</l>
               <l>The world's a maſquerade! the maſquers, you, you, you.</l>
               <stage>To Boxes, Pit, Gall.</stage>
               <l>Lud! what a groupe the motley ſcene diſcloſes!</l>
               <l>Falſe wits, falſe wives, falſe virgins, and falſe ſpouſes:</l>
               <l>Stateſmen with bridles on; and, cloſe beſide 'em,</l>
               <l>Patriots, in party colour'd ſuits, that ride 'em.</l>
               <l>There Hebes, turn'd of fifty, try once more,</l>
               <l>To raiſe a flame in Cupids of threeſcore.</l>
               <l>Theſe, in their turn, with appetites as keen,</l>
               <l>Deſerting fifty, faſten on fifteen.</l>
               <l>Miſs, not yet full fifteen, with fire uncommon,</l>
               <l>Flings down her ſampler, and takes up the woman:</l>
               <l>The little urchin ſmiles, and ſpreads her lure,</l>
               <l>And tries to kill ere ſhe's got power to cure.</l>
               <l>Thus 'tis with all—Their chief and conſtant care</l>

               </l>
               <l>Strip but his vizor off, and ſure I am,</l>
               <l>You'll find his lionſhip a very lamb.</l>
               <l>Yon politician, famous in debate,</l>
               <l>Perhaps to vulgar eyes beſtrides the ſtate;</l>
               <l>Yet, when he deigns his real ſhape t' aſſume,</l>
               <l>He turns old woman, and beſtrides a broom.</l>
               <l>Yon patriot too, who preſſes on your ſight,</l>
               <l>And ſeems to every gazer all in white;</l>
               <l>If with a bribe his candour you attack,</l>
               <l>He bows, turns round, and whip—the man's a black!</l>
               <l>Yon critic too—but whither do I run?</l>
               <l>If I proceed, our bard will be undone!</l>
               <l>Well then, a truce, ſince ſhe requeſts it too;</l>
               <l>Do you ſpare her, and I'll for once ſpare you.</l>
