            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>☞ It is near three years ſince the above lines were written, and the Firſt Part of THE MAID OF ARRAGON finiſhed; though other avocations have prevented the publication till now. This circumſtance is mentioned, to ſhew that they were prompted by the heart, and not by the deſire of imitating the Author of an admirable Novel, which was addreſſed to a Father ſince that period.</p>

            <head>DEPRECATION.</head>
            <p>I ENTREAT the Reviewers to have compaſſion on me. From the beginning of my literary warfare, theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful Wits have purſued me with the ſharpeſt arrows of Criticiſm; and I have had nothing to conſole me, alas!—but the approbation of the Public. How ſhall I eſcape now, when to all my other faults are added, ſo many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages in Geography? With what triumph of critical ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city will they ſay, (after the neceſſary ſtrictures on the ſtory, thoughts, and verſes) <q rend="inline margQuotes">"If our Author was determined to ſend her Pegaſus into <hi>Spain,</hi> in queſt of adventures, ſhe ought to have conſulted <hi>Salmon</hi> about the ſituation of its provinces. She would there have found that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi> is fifty miles from the ſea; and that the <hi>Moors</hi> could not poſſibly have debarked on its confines, unleſs, like fiſh to the <hi>London</hi> markets, their fleet had arrived by land-carriage. With equal facility, the troops of the King of <hi>Leon</hi> are brought acroſs <hi>Old Caſtile</hi> to <hi>Saragoſſa</hi> in about thirty hours—another miracle; which was doubtleſs accompliſhed by the interpoſition of a friendly necromancer, who furniſhed the army with wings, in exchange for ſome chaſte damſel, or beautifull princeſs. Had this Lady-Writer's reading extended to a <hi>tranſlation</hi> of the Iliad, ſhe would have found no examples of ſuch liberties there. <hi>Homer</hi> gives an exact map of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries he carries us through; and from <hi>Ithaca</hi> to <hi>Troy,</hi> not a village or river is miſplaced."</q>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0134200800:5"/>
True: but <hi>Homer</hi> (I name him as a modern Painter mentions a <hi>Correggio,</hi> and a <hi>Raphael</hi>) <hi>Homer</hi> united the Hiſtorian with the Poet—I deal entirely in fiction. It was enough for me, that <hi>Spain,</hi> through a ſucceſſion of ages, had been ſubject to the ravages of <hi>Africa;</hi> and that during this period, ſovereigns had been robbed of their crowns, and been obliged to reſign their ſceptres to their ſwarthy conquerors. The relation of the particular events of theſe remote times, the Hiſtoric Muſe has generally left to her creative Siſter, who never fails to profit by their obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in relating them to the world in her own manner; the geography of the heart, and the hiſtory of the paſſions, are the only realities to which ſhe attends. If, in deſcribing <hi>theſe,</hi> I ſhall be found deviating from the laws of Truth, and Nature, I ſhall have failed in my intention; but I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, if the <hi>cacoethes ſcribendi</hi> ſhould continue on me, or if I ſhould ever wander again into the regions of Romance, I ſhall treat oceans and provinces with as little ceremony as rivulets and meadows: I will avail myſelf of the eſtabliſhed privileges, and raiſe mountains, ſeas, or kingdoms, in any part of the habitable globe that hits my fancy; or, if it ſtrikes me, build a temple to Dullneſs—in the chamber of a Reviewer.</p>

               <l>The royal pair, in humble weeds diſguis'd,</l>
               <l>Inſtant forſook the hoſpitable roof,</l>

The ſpirits of the King, weigh'd down with ſorrow,</l>
               <l>Had ſunk beneath accumulated ills,</l>
               <l>Had not wiſe Heav'n endu'd his Daughter's mind</l>
               <l>With ſtrength to bear <hi>her</hi> griefs, and chear her Father's.</l>
               <l>With tender talk the tedious way ſhe ſhorten'd;</l>
               <l>And, when exhauſted Nature aſk'd recruit,</l>
               <l>Hymn'd him to ſleep beneath umbrageous trees.</l>
               <l>A whole day's ſun beheld her duteous cares:</l>
               <l>The moon aroſe, and ſtill they journey'd on;</l>
               <l>But the ſucceeding ſun, with earlieſt beam,</l>
               <l>Guided the travellers to a foreſt's verge.</l>
               <l>Here GONZALES the ſteeds unrein'd, and drove,</l>
               <l>In envied freedom, to a neighb'ring mountain,</l>
               <l>Leſt their betraying hoofs ſhould guide purſuers</l>
               <l>To the aſylum of the hunted King.</l>
               <l>In the wood's centre they a cottage found,</l>
               <l>Form'd, by Misfortune's hand, of humble clay:</l>
               <l>Two rooms it had, in each a ruſtic bed;</l>
               <l>For ſtately chairs, a bench; a rough-hewn table,</l>
               <l>That ne'er with other dainties had been fill'd,</l>
               <l>Than labour cull'd from the ſurrounding herbs;</l>

               <l>With their delicious burdens long had ſwell'd,</l>
               <l>Nor found one tempted hand to eaſe the load.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>Such the retreat the fugitives had found.</l>

               <l>Adieu to greatneſs, and unhealthful pomp!</l>
               <l>The winds now ruſtle through their ſtraw-crown'd cot,</l>
               <l>And birds, with wild-note ſweet, compoſe their concert!</l>
               <l>Full ſeven ſlow moons have turn'd their monthly orbs,</l>

               <l>Thus ſpeaking, to his lips he fix'd a bugle,</l>
               <l>Whoſe piercing ſounds ten thouſand echoes bore</l>
               <l>On airy wings, through the ſurrounding woods.</l>

               <l>No ſooner ſpoke his joy, than, like a fawn</l>

               <l>Of the fierce wolf—ſhe bounding left her ſeat,</l>

               <l>Broke from her tempting arms. He call'd OSMIDA.</l>
               <l>Liſt'ning in vain, to hear her cheering voice,</l>
               <l>He ſtarted from his couch, and, rob'd in haſte,</l>
               <l>Ruſh'd forth to ſeek her in her fav'rite haunts:</l>

               <l>Not gueſſing at th'extremity of woe,</l>

               <l>Her tears bedew'd the ſenſeleſs earth; her cries</l>

               <l>Scarce ſenſible to what was urg'd, OSMIDA</l>
               <l>Allow'd herſelf once more upon a ſteed</l>
               <l>To be replac'd: her horſeman, noble ARLOS;</l>
               <l>Who through moraſſes, underwoods, and roads</l>
               <l>Almoſt impervious, brought his royal ward</l>
               <l>In ſafety to his manſion. Oh! how bleſt</l>
               <l>This moment had appear'd, had the ſame roof</l>
               <l>That ſhelter'd her, been ſhelter to her Father!</l>
               <l>That ſolace wanting, others loſt their taſte.</l>
               <l>Her ſorrows to ſuſpend, ARLOS related</l>
               <l>Events that yet could not have reach'd her ear.</l>
               <l>The faithful GONZALES, he told the Princeſs,</l>
               <l>Suſpected by ZORADOR, bore the rack</l>
               <l>With undiminiſh'd courage, nor confeſt,</l>
               <l>—Though life was promis'd, and immenſe rewards,</l>
               <l>The place of her retreat: that he, Lord ARLOS,</l>
               <l>By wiles and arts, the jealous Tyrant blinded,</l>
               <l>Who held him trueſt ſervant of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Thus, unſuſpected, he had watch'd the roads</l>
               <l>Which led towards her foreſt; with his life</l>

To die upon the block—on ſtale pretence,</l>
               <l>That he had form'd a plot to wreſt the crown.</l>
               <l>His family he baniſh'd, their rich lands</l>

               <l>It was enough: ſhe ſaw them paſs the gates,</l>

               <l>None could her anguiſh leſſen—none her woe increaſe.</l>
               <l>Their tale ſcarce won attention. Much they talk'd</l>
               <l>Of hot purſuit, and of the villain's ſpeed;</l>
               <l>—That once his flagging courſer rais'd their hopes,</l>
               <l>When ſudden on a neighb'ring plain appear'd</l>
               <l>A troop of <hi>Spahies</hi> in a mock engagement:</l>

               <l>Whilſt thoſe who follow'd, meaſur'd back their road,</l>

               <l>The ſweeteſt words, e'er fram'd by conſolation,</l>
               <l>Were ſpent upon the air. The young ELVERA,</l>
               <l>Siſter to ARLOS, lent her infant aid</l>
               <l>To chear the royal gueſt; and with ſoft prattle,</l>
               <l>—Kiſſing the drowning roſes on her cheek,</l>
               <l>Strove to divide her ſorrow-fixt attention.</l>
               <l>But, oh! her Father was a wretched captive:</l>
               <l>What could abate the anguiſh of that thought?</l>
               <l>In vain ſurrounding ſlaves watch'd ev'ry motion;</l>

Forcing their grandeur on the awe-ſtruck eye;</l>
               <l>In vain the downy beds invited reſt,</l>
               <l>Beneath rich canopies imboſs'd with gold.</l>
               <l>Dearer the ruſſet pillars of the foreſt,</l>

               <l>Where ſtood her lonely cot. Oh! dearer far</l>
               <l>The humble couch on which her Father's head</l>
               <l>Securely reſted; where her ready hand</l>
               <l>His pillow ſmooth'd, and filial cares excited</l>
               <l>Sweeter ſlumbers! Who, now, will watch his ſleep,</l>
