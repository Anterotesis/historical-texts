            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The Nymphs who preſide over ſprings and rivulets are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed at day-break in honour of their ſeveral functions, and of the relations which they bear to the natural and to the moral world. Their origin is deduced from the firſt allegorical deities, or powers of nature; according to the doctrine of the old mythological poets, concerning the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Gods and the riſe of things. They are then ſucceſſively conſidered, as giving motion to the air and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing ſummer-breezes; as nouriſhing and beautifying the vegetable world; as contributing to the fulneſs of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable rivers, and conſequently to the maintenance of commerce; and by that means, to the maritime part of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary power. Next is repreſented their favourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon health, when aſſiſted by rural exerciſe: which introduces their connection with the art of phyſic, and the happy effects of mineral, medicinal ſprings. Laſtly, they are celebrated for the friendſhip which the Muſes bear them, and for the true inſpiration which temperance only can receive: in oppoſition to the enthuſiaſm of the more licentious poets.</p>

               <byline>By Mr. W. TAYLOR.</byline>
               <l>A JOLLY, brave toper, who cou'd not forbear</l>
               <l>Tho' his life was in danger, old port and ſtale beer,</l>
               <l>Gave the doctors the hearing—but ſtill wou'd drink on,</l>
               <l>Till the dropſy had ſwell'd him as big as a ton.</l>
               <l>The more he took phyſic the worſe ſtill he grew,</l>
               <l>And tapping was now the laſt thing he cou'd do.</l>
               <l>Affairs at this criſis, and doctors come down,</l>
               <l>He began to conſider—ſo ſent for his ſon.</l>
               <l>Tom, ſee by what courſes I've ſhorten'd my life,</l>
               <l>I'm leaving the world ere I'm forty and five;</l>
               <l>More than probable 'tis, that in twenty-four hours,</l>
               <l>This manor, this houſe, and eſtate will be yours;</l>
               <l>My early exceſſes may teach you this truth,</l>
               <l>That 'tis working for death to drink hard in one's youth.</l>
               <l>Says Tom, (who's a lad of a generous ſpirit,</l>
               <l>And not like young rakes who 're in haſte to inherit,)</l>
               <l>Sir, don't be diſhearten'd; altho' it be true,</l>
               <l>Th' operation is painful, and hazardous too,</l>
               <l>'Tis no more than what many a man has gone thro'.</l>
               <l>And then, as for years, you may yet be call'd young,</l>
               <l>Your life after this may be happy and long.</l>
               <l>Don't flatter me, Tom, was the father's reply,</l>
               <l>With a jeſt in his mouth and a tear in his eye;</l>
               <l>Too well by experience, my veſſels, thou know'ſt,</l>
               <l>No ſooner are tap'd, but they give up the ghoſt.</l>

                  <l>Methought I was now a fine gentleman grown,</l>
                  <l>And had got, Lord knows how, an eſtate of my own.</l>
                  <l>Good-bye to plain Tom, I was rais'd a peg higher;</l>
                  <l>Some call'd me his worſhip, and others the ſquire.</l>
                  <l>'Twas a place, I remember, exactly like Eaſton,</l>
                  <l>A ſcene for an emperor's fancy to feaſt on.</l>
                  <l>There I built a fine houſe with great coſt and great care,</l>

                  <l>The apartments not ſmall, nor monſtrouſly great,</l>
                  <l>But chiefly for uſe, and a little for ſtate;</l>
                  <l>So begilt, and becarv'd, and with ornaments grac'd,</l>
                  <l>That ev'ry one ſaid, I'd an excellent taſte.</l>
                  <l>Here I liv'd like a king, never hoarded my pelf,</l>
                  <l>Kept a coach for my ſiſters, a nag for myſelf,</l>
                  <l>With ſomething that's good when our Highclear friends come,</l>
                  <l>And, ſpite of 'ſquire Herbert, a fire in each room.</l>
                  <l>A canal made for profit as well as for pleaſure,</l>
                  <l>That's about, let me ſee, two acres in meaſure;</l>
                  <l>Both the eye to delight, and the table to crown</l>
                  <l>With a jack, or a perch, when my uncles come down.</l>
                  <l>An exceeding great wood, that's been ſet a great while,</l>
                  <l>In length near a league, and in breadth near a mile.</l>

                  <l>IXION, as the poets tell us,</l>
                  <l>Was one of thoſe pragmatic fellows,</l>
                  <l>Who claim a right to kiſs the hand</l>
                  <l>Of the beſt lady in the land;</l>
                  <l>Demonſtrating by dint of reaſon,</l>
                  <l>That impudence in love's no treaſon.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>He let his fancy ſoar much higher;</l>
                  <l>And ventur'd boldly to aſpire</l>
                  <l>To Juno's high and mighty grace,</l>
                  <l>And woo'd the goddeſs face to face.</l>

                  <l>To think of cuckolding a God?</l>
                  <l>For ſhe was both Jove's wife and ſiſter,</l>
                  <l>And yet the raſcal wou'd have kiſs'd her.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>How he got up to heav'n's high palace,</l>
                  <l>Not one of all the poets tell us;</l>
                  <l>It muſt be therefore underſtood,</l>
                  <l>That he got up which way he cou'd.</l>
                  <l>Nor is it, that I know, recorded,</l>

                  <l>Chlorinda, who beyond compare</l>
                  <l>Of all the fair ones is moſt fair;</l>
                  <l>Chlorinda, by the Gods deſign'd</l>
                  <l>To be the pattern of her kind,</l>
                  <l>With every charm of face and mind;</l>
                  <l>Glanc'd light'ning from her eyes ſo blue,</l>
                  <l>And ſhot poor Strephon through and through.</l>
                  <l>He, over head and ears her lover,</l>
                  <l>Try'd all the ways he cou'd to move her;</l>
                  <l>He ſigh'd, and vow'd, and pray'd, and cry'd,</l>
                  <l>And did a thouſand things beſide:</l>
                  <l>She let him ſigh, and pray, and cry on —</l>

                  <l>The Goddeſs, proud, (as folks report her)</l>
                  <l>Diſdain'd that mortal wight ſhou'd court her,</l>
                  <l>And yet ſhe choſe the fool to flatter,</l>

                  <l>And hope in time he might get at her;</l>
                  <l>Grac'd him with now and then a ſmile,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>She call'd a pretty painted cloud,</l>
                  <l>The brighteſt of the wand'ring crowd,</l>
                  <l>For ſhe you know is queen o' th' air,</l>

                  <l>A ſmock which Pallas ſpun and gave her</l>

                  <l>I have nor meat, nor drink, nor cloaths,</l>

               <l>None but a GARRICK can, O bard divine!</l>

               <l>To ſpeak thy worth is his peculiar boaſt,</l>

               <l>Blended with his thy merits riſe to view,</l>

               <l>Unleſs the actor with the bard conſpire,</l>
               <l>How impotent his ſtrength, how faint his fire!</l>
               <l>One boaſts the <hi>mine,</hi> one brings the gold to <hi>light,</hi>

            <p>HAVING now, by the advice and aſſiſtance of my friends, brought this Collection of POEMS to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent ſize, it has been thought proper that the farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of its growth ſhould here be ſtop'd. From the looſe and fugitive pieces, ſome printed, others in manuſcript, which for forty or fifty years paſt have been thrown into the world, and careleſsly left to periſh; I have here, according to the moſt judicious opinions I could obtain in diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their merits, endeavour'd to ſelect and preſerve the beſt. The favourable reception which the former volumes have met with, demands my warmeſt acknowledgments, and calls for all my care in compleating the Collection; and in this reſpect, if it appear that I have not been altogether negligent, I ſhall hope to be allow'd the merit, which is all I claim, of having furniſh'd to the Public an elegant and polite Amuſement. Little more need be added, than to return my thanks to ſeveral ingenious friends, who have obligingly contributed to this Entertainment. If the reader ſhould happen to find, what I hope he ſeldom will, any pieces which he may think unworthy of having been inſerted; as it would ill become me to attribute his diſlike of them to his own want of Taſte, ſo I am too conſcious of my own deficiencies not to allow him to impute the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of them to mine.</p>
