            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>AFTER having laboured ſo hard during the beſt part of our lives, thus at laſt to fall into poverty! To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is it, that we have never ceaſed our cares and pains for a ſingle moment, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to breed up our children with credit? If they were but of an age to earn their own bread, it would be ſomething! My dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it is not for myſelf, it is for you that I ſhed tears; in loſing our cattle we have loſt our all. What remains is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient to pay our landlord. What is to become of us? If my good huſband did not ſupport my ſinking courage, I ſhould
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0277100500:6"/>die with grief. But how worthy a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter he is! What a man! How tranquil in the midſt of our misfortunes! Were I not ſure that affection makes him conceal the greateſt part of his troubles from the fear of afflicting me, I ſhould believe he were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to them. "Why doſt thou weep, Martha?" he often ſays, when I can no longer reſtrain my tears: "We have had a loſs, it is true; but who knows what Providence has in ſtore for us? I, for my part, make that my dependence." Alas! though never rich himſelf, he was always a friend to the unfortunate! How many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in this village has he ſaved from mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery by his advice and aſſiſtance! There is not a better man on earth; and I ſtill poſſeſs what many women want in the midſt of riches, a worthy huſband, and children whoſe good diſpoſitions fill our hearts with joy. Whilſt I think on theſe bleſſings, I feel that Providence watches over us, and my griefs become lighter. Take courage then, Martha, enough is left to conſole thee in thy affliction.

You replied, with an embrace, that you would be the firſt to ſet the example. I made a ſign to my ſiſter to retire; we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced each other alſo; whatever you had engaged to do for us, we agreed together in return to do for you.</p>

                     <p>My dear children, you take too large a ſhare in our troubles, they are not ſuited to your age; fear nothing, Heaven will have care of you. Oh, my child, you have made me feel the happineſs of being a mother. What earthly good can equal the joy which this inſtance of your tender duty has given me! but be comforted. I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the remainder of this for you, and you may, at leaſt to-day, eat your bread as uſual; it is neceſſary that you ſhould get ſtrength, in order to earn ſomething for us when you grow older. Will you not be glad to labour for your father and mother?</p>

                     <p>Ah, glad indeed! that I ſhall; but we can begin now: our hands, it is true, are ſmall, but we will work the longer for that, and all that we earn we will give to my father to purchaſe more cattle. Then we will rear poultry and ſell our eggs; and this money, all this money, we will gladly bring to you, dear mother. <stage>(Seeing the tears in her mother's eyes.)</stage> Oh, do not weep, I beſeech you; you make my heart ſink.</p>

                     <p>No, he took a walk down to the hall; he wanted to ſpeak with our land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord.</p>

                     <p>Yes, my dear, hitherto he has been very good to us; pray Heaven he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be ſo now we have occaſion for it.

I ſhall eat of the bread of bitterneſs till I have paid my debt to the utmoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

                     <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh, certainly, we will do it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily. What did Mr. Parks ſay to this?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>I was already acquainted with your loſſes, honeſt Thorowgood, ſaid he, and am heartily ſorry for them. I pity you alſo, ſaid Madam, with her ſweet voice: I pity you with all my heart.</p>

                     <p>I do not come here, ſaid I, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite compaſſion, I have no occaſion for it, as I am able to work. My great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern is, that I cannot acquit myſelf of my debt to you: I own I feel for my wife and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0277100500:18"/>my young family: I who would have ſhed my blood to preſerve them from want! You who are rich and without children, know not what it is to ſee thoſe ſuffer to whom we have given life. Ah! if you had ſuch children as I have; if you loved them with all your ſoul, and were beloved by them as I am!—In ſaying this, grief made me hide my face; and when I lifted up my eyes again, I ſaw Mr. Parks was no longer looking at me: he had turned towards his wife; their eyes were filled with tears, and fixed on each other. Pity was not the only ſentiment which then affected them; I plainly ſaw that ſomething which more nearly concerned themſelves, occupied their minds.</p>

                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>I had not the courage; but as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to talk of my children, Mr. Parks ſtrove to change the diſcourſe. I perceived clearly that ſome private affliction was the cauſe of this, and therefore haſtened to quit the ſubject, and began talking about my corn, and reckoning how much it would yield towards paying my rent.</p>

                     <p>And pray, was not Mr. Parks very angry when he found it fall ſo ſhort of that ſum?</p>

                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>Why all that we can do now, is to collect together our houſehold goods and farming utenſils, and ſell them to pay our landlord: we will keep nothing but what is on our backs; we can then ſhew ourſelves before him with a clear conſcience.

                     <p>I will tell you: when the diſeaſe firſt broke out amongſt our cattle, I ſaw Humphries was quite caſt down by it; as I had always hitherto been more fortunate than he, I offered to do all in my power to ſerve him. He thanked me in ſo affecting a manner, that I wiſhed to give him ſome proof of my good will to him upon the ſpot. You muſt know, juſt before the diſorder appeared, we had made a joint purchaſe of twelve cows at a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring fair. It is true, I advanced two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirds of the money; but upon his conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to graze them for a certain time on his farm, (which was an excellent bargain for him in point of money, as we ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled it) I told him that whatever of the herd ſhould eſcape the mortality, we would divide equally between us. At that time I had no reaſon to think that this arrangement would turn out in my favour; and now, though it has, I ſhould be far from taking advantage of it if it regarded myſelf alone; but I am no longer maſter of my own. I am obliged to give up all my remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0277100500:29"/>property to my landlord. I ſhould, therefore, think myſelf guilty of a theft, if I did not, on this account, lay claim to every thing due to me.</p>

                     <p>How ſo? have you not a fine field of wheat, of which you may make many a good pound? If you mean to ſell it, I am your man; I will buy it as it is, and pay the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney down; what ſay you?</p>

                     <p>Are you mad, Thorowgood? why you have the law on your ſide; till your grain is made over to your landlord, by ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, it belongs to you, and you may do what you pleaſe with it.

                     <p>Why, I think that we ought, in the firſt place, to pay our debts, at any rate; if we have loſt our cattle, our landlord has not gained by it; the loſs, therefore, is our affair, not his.</p>

                     <p>Why, he is ſo rich, the loſs to him will be no more than a crown would be to us.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>Aye, that alone reſtrains you: but if I were to judge you, Meadows, I would let you ſee that you do not deſerve it the leſs for what you have juſt now propoſed to me. I ſee no difference, for my part, between rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing a man of his money, or robbing him of the fruits of his land.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mead.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh, there is a great difference in the two caſes.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>There may be ſo; but if you will reflect a little, I am of opinion, you will think as I do.</p>

                     <p>I do not deſire it, indeed; there is little to be got by this way of reaſoning. Come, come, Thorowgood, conſider your own intereſt a little better: your landlord will have great obligations to you, to be ſure, when you have reduced yourſelf to want on his account: he will only deſpiſe you, and treat you the worſe for it.</p>

                     <p>And pray what harm have I done you? but you are an obſtinate man. I wiſh to preſerve your family from want; it is you that are the hard-hearted man, and will be guilty of all their ſufferings, and, perhaps, their death. I only deſire to give you your own price for your wheat; that is, if you are reaſonable; and here is the money.</p>

                     <p>Meadows, I have loſt in eight days all that I am worth, and am reduced to the laſt farthing; but if ever I am guilty of a diſhoneſt action, even to ſupply my moſt urgent neceſſities, <stage>(pulling off his hat,)</stage> may Heaven ſtrike me dead with its thunder!</p>

O, my good friend, though it is a ſad thing to become an object of pity, yet there is a wide difference between being pitied, and being ill ſpoken of! Thanks be to heaven, you will never have cauſe to regret having known me.

No, no, my good neighbour, I am as yet guilty of the ruin of no one; and it ſhall never be ſaid that I will become ſo. As long as I live I will ſleep with a clear conſcience.

                     <p>Why, Martha, what ſtill caſt down? Shall our children be more courageous than we? We poſſeſs all their love; but do not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0277100500:49"/>let us leſſen it by giving them cauſe to eſteem us leſs. They know that it is not our bad conduct which has brought theſe misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes upon us; but if we ſuffer ourſelves to be overcome by a weak deſpair, we ſhall appear faulty to them. Come, let us think no more of our troubles than as they have given us occaſion to feel the comfort which our children have given us.</p>

                     <p>Yes, my dear, it is the ſweeteſt that a mother can feel. Could I ever have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to ſee them ſo ſenſible and good, at ſo early an age?</p>

                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>And why not, Martha? Could I ever doubt that a woman like thee, would not bring my children up as worthy as her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? They will be the ſtaff of our old age; when decrepit with years, we may reſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly upon them. But I hear Valentine's voice; I have ſomething important to ſay to him.—Martha, ſhall I beg of thee to leave me alone with him a little?</p>

                     <p>And I, Martha, am as ready as you to declare this. Yes, Valentine, you have done for us a hundred times more than we had a right to expect. I love you with all the tenderneſs of a real father; but, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, you know that I am not yours.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0277100500:52"/>Had we continued in proſperity, you ſhould have always been our ſon, our dear ſon; all my other children believe you to be their brother. I meant, after my death, that you ſhould have ſhared with them the little ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which you have daily helped me to increaſe.

                     <p>Yes, I ought to do ſo; the ties of blood bind them to our lot, whatever it be; if we ſuffer, they ought to ſuffer with us; but you, what right have I to involve you in my diſtreſs? No, Valentine, I adviſe you as a friend; and if it muſt be, I command you as a father to quit an unfortunate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. It is time that you ſhould do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for yourſelf; ſince it is no longer in my power to give you a fortune, I rejoice that I have had you ſo well inſtructed as to enable you to gain one.</p>

                     <p>My hands, it is true, have repaid what your hands have done for me; but my heart has not yet repaid your love. O my father, recall to your remembrance the firſt days of my infancy, when I was as a ſtranger in your family. How many times have you preſſed me in your arms at your return from hard labour, which you had prolonged in order to ſupport me. And you, my dear mother, can you forget the many tender careſſes that you have laviſhed on me,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0277100500:54"/>at the very time when I was eating the bread of your children? You alone received me when abandoned by all the world; and ſhall I now abandon you? I was your ſon to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit your fortune, and ſhall I not be ſo to ſhare your poverty? Alas, how much you muſt have deſpiſed me before you could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me capable of this!</p>

I devote myſelf entirely to you: whether you go, or remain, I will never quit you: you may fly me, but you ſhall not hinder my following you.

                     <p>I told you this morning that we ſhould not be able to pay our rent; it is therefore our duty to give you up what we have, and you ſee it collected here. With the ſale of our furniture, clothes, and corn, we mean to pay you as far as we can. Whatever may be deficient, we will endeavour to earn by our labour, till we have paid to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. I hope, Sir, you will at preſent, be

                     <p>You know as well as myſelf, Sir, that I had drained the marſhes in order to make them fit for paſture, and they were in a thriving way. All the money that we had remaining laſt year, we laid out in cattle, in order to fatten them for ſale. Twenty head of good cattle was a little fortune, which promiſed fair to pay our rent, by ſending a few of them off to market. A drought came on; there was ſcarcely a blade of graſs in my fields: I fed my cattle with the ſtraw of my bed, the thatch of my barn, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with the vegetables that were for my family's uſe. When I wanted to get rid of them, I could find no purchaſer, owing to the ſcarcity of fodder. A murrain got amongſt them, and I loſt them all: I owe nothing, however, to any body but to you, Sir. Come and look at your grounds, you will ſee whether I have neglected to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate them; you will ſee if my own labour, with that of my wife and children, may not enable me one day to pay all my debts: I can, however, give you no other ſecurity
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0277100500:65"/>than my own word; but as I have always been punctual, till now, in my engagements with you, I ſhould hope that you would have ſome reliance on my promiſe.</p>

                     <p>Your laws are as corrupt as thoſe who ſtifle their voice, if they will not ſpeak out on ſuch occaſions. Hear me, Sir; I am entirely ignorant of law proceedings; but I would not heſitate to ſay openly to that juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which would ſubmit to that reſtriction —Thou haſt no farther buſineſs upon earth; be gone then to hell, where the wicked ſhall at laſt meet with due puniſhment. Were I the dupe of the father, I would go to the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0277100500:70"/>children, and aſk them, by what right they retained the property which ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to me? If they ſhould tell me, that they received it from their parents, my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer would be, your parents could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it on you; it belongs to me. I would compel them, without mercy, to ſell the bed from under them in order to ſatisfy me.</p>

                     <p>No, Sir, begging your pardon; the latter are ſtill more ſo; the former are knaves, but the others are monſters.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0277100500:71"/>ſtill think myſelf bound to fulfil all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements. I ſhould conſider it as a duty of inheritance in me to acquit his memory, and preſerve the integrity of his name. Though I were to live upon bread alone, to the laſt hour of my life, and be obliged to work the fleſh from my bones, I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to pay all his debts; and when I had done ſo, I would go to his grave, and addreſs him thus: Father, now reſt in peace, thou oweſt nothing.</p>

They will fetch ten pounds a piece the leaſt penny: they ſha'n't go for a farthing leſs, not to a prince. You may reckon upon ſo much; this will reduce our account ſo much. We will ſettle it, if you pleaſe. My debts hang like a mountain on my ſhoulders. I long to be eaſed of the heavy burden.</p>

                     <p>My property! it is no longer mine, it is yours. Hear me, Sir; you know per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well, that I would not attempt to act a generous part by you at the expence of my family. I give you up nothing but what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to you. Reſt aſſured that I would not offer it to you, if I thought I could retain it with a ſafe conſcience. It would become me, truly, to make you preſents! You would laugh at me. To cut the matter ſhort, I cannot pay you the debt in ready money: I reſign, therefore, all my poſſeſſions, without injury to your remaining claim, which I will pay, that I will, you may depend; you ſhall

                     <p>I have already told you, Sir, that children ſhould pay for their parents. When the one ſuffers, what pretence can the others have to refuſe ſharing in the affliction?

                     <p>Oh! be not afraid that I ſhall attempt to recall my words. No, Sir, we are already

                     <p>No, my dear children, the ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity which you have ſhewn in aſſiſting your parents, has taught me how worthy you all are to be relieved in your afflictions: take back, then, all that you have given for them, but make that uſe of it to which your tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs firſt prompted you. For example, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; as your father has loſt his cattle, would you not be glad to employ what you have ſaved in buying others for him?</p>

                     <p>Indeed, I had formerly ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wine always by me, which I kept for my father. When I happened to meet with good markets in town, my firſt buſineſs was to go and buy half a dozen bottles of the beſt that I could get, be the price what it would: I did not drink it myſelf, I gave it to wife to keep for thoſe days when my father came to ſee us, and then I entertained him well. Do you remember, Martha, how happy the good old man uſed to be? My children, he would ſay, this wine ſtrengthens and cheers me; but your affection, which makes you deny yourſelves comforts for my ſake,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0277100500:92"/>ſtrengthens and rejoices my heart ſtill more: he was ſometimes ſo much affected, that the tears flowed down his cheeks. You cannot conceive how exquiſite the wine taſted to me, whilſt I had my father drinking by my ſide. <stage>(Jenny comes in with two bottles.)</stage>

                     <p>Come, Sir, and I will tell you the reaſon: do you ſee, near yonder hedge, an old apple tree that has ſcarcely any leaves on it? My mother was ſaying, this ſpring, that ſhe was very ſorry that the froſt had injured it ſo much, for ſhe had never eat ſo good apples, as it bore, in her life, and that the tree was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to die; the next morning, before ſhe was up, my brother and I went to pick out the moſt flouriſhing buds we could ſee, in order to engraft them on other trees in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0277100500:97"/>that in caſe the old tree ſhould periſh, my mother might ſtill have ſome good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; had we left the farm, it would have been a ſad thing; ſomebody elſe would have come into it, and in time have eaten of the fruit which we had engrafted.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. Parks.</speaker>
                     <p>Nothing could be eaſier than for you to have taken them with you, and then nobody would have benefited by your labour.</p>

                     <speaker>George.</speaker>
                     <p>Why ſhould I do ſo? that would have been no advantage; and though it were, I know very well that we ought not to ſeek an advantage to ourſelves, that would be a prejudice to our fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: on the contrary, I ſhould have wiſhed them to gather good fruit from our trees.</p>

                     <p>Yes, when they are like ours; then, indeed, they are real bleſſings; and parents enjoy in them a treaſure ineſtimable.

                     <p>He is not my ſon, though I love him as much as if he were ſo, and I have done for him all that I could have done for a child of my own, and the worthy lad is deſerving of all my tenderneſs; he love us as much as if we had given him birth, and he works for our ſupport as if he were the eldeſt of my little family.</p>

                     <p>That we are as much ſtrangers to as you are; we ſaved his life when he was an infant in the cradle; my wife ſuckled him, and he has always lived with us. He muſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0277100500:101"/>not have been of common origin; he had round his neck a coral, adorned with gold and jewels; and the linen he had on was of the fineſt kind.</p>

                     <p>You preſerved his life! you are ignorant of his family; and he is not of vulgar race! Ah, dear Thorowgood, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell me how he fell into your hands.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>It is a melancholy ſtory:—We then lived in the north of England; I rented a farm there on the banks of a river; it was an excellent ſituation, and the land yielded abundantly;—no thanks to the care of the former tenant though—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Parks.</speaker>
                     <p>Paſs over theſe circumſtances, pray, and only tell me all that relates to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine; that alone inflames my curioſity.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, Sir, to come to the point at once; you muſt know, that one night we were rouſed from our ſleep by the water's ruſhing into our houſe on all ſides: we had hardly time to get upon the roof to wait for relief there: in the morning a boat came to our aſſiſtance; the whole country was under water; the river was covered with the ruins of houſes and furniture, carried away by the force of the current. I was endeavouring to comfort my wife, who lamented the loſs of our cottage, but ſtill more that of her ſon,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0277100500:102"/>who was ſtifled in the water before he awoke; in the mean time, I ſuddenly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a cradle, toſſed about in the flood, which was running rapidly, and threatening every moment to ſwallow it up. I could not bear the ſight; I threw off my clothes, and, regardleſs of danger, I plunged into the river, ſwimming with all my might towards the cradle. I was driven back ſeveral times, and almoſt exhauſted with fatigue; but the cries of the child, which I heard as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, inſpired me with freſh ſpirits and vigour: in ſhort, after much difficulty and danger, I got up to it, and brought it to the bank a good way lower down. My wife followed me creeping, more dead than alive, along the ſide of the river. I preſented the infant to her, which continued crying until ſhe gave it the breaſt. Poor Martha fancied that ſhe had recovered her loſt child. We then made all poſſible inquiries to ſee if we could diſcover the parents, but we never could get any information: our affliction at length ceaſed; we continued to look upon him as our own ſon. I have related the whole ſtory to the boy himſelf a hundred times: I concealed it indeed from my own children, to let them enjoy the pleaſure of thinking him their brother, and to avoid all
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0277100500:103"/>occaſion of jealouſy. I have had him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed like the reſt: he does his work as well as I can myſelf: he talks as if he were reading out of a book: and he can read and write as well as our ſchoolmaſter.</p>

                     <p>About fifteen years and a few months, as well as I can remember. But hold, I can tell you to a minute, for I had a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial drawn up the magiſtrate of the place, ſigned by the rector, and atteſted by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who were witneſſes of the event. When I quitted the country, I took care to carry it with me. Go fetch it, Martha.</p>

                     <p>My heart already tells me how worthy thou art of my love. Yes, my ſon, my dear, my only ſon, this heart has been always full of thee. But thy mother! what tranſport will ſhe not feel at ſight of thee!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Valen.</speaker>
                     <p>Ah, lead me to her, I entreat you. How I long to throw myſelf at her feet, and claſp her in my arms!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Parks.</speaker>
                     <p>Come then, my ſon, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach myſelf for every moment that I delay her happineſs. Let us run; let us fly.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>Conſider what you are about; will you break the good lady's heart by exceſs of joy? No, no, it ſhall not be ſo; firſt let us drink a glaſs of wine to ſtrengthen our minds and bodies, otherwiſe we ſhall all be wrong; I will then go and break the matter diſtantly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0277100500:109"/>to Madam, and prepare her for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view with her ſon. Ah, Valentine, how happy you will be to know her!</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Valen.</speaker>
                     <p>I ſhall ſee her then to-day, after having ſo long dreaded that I ſhould never have that comfort! It is impoſſible to expreſs the tenderneſs that I already feel for her.</p>
                  </sp>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Valen.</speaker>
                     <p>Will I love you! I will always call you mother as well as her. If ſhe brought me into life, did not you cheriſh it with the milk of your boſom, after my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond father preſerved it? What muſt have become of me but for you both? Your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me hath been greater than I ſhall ever be able to repay.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. Parks.</speaker>
                     <p>Say not ſo, my child. Ah, though it were to coſt me half of my fortune, I am reſolved that theſe worthy people—</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho. </speaker>
                     <stage>(haſtily interrupting him.)</stage>
                     <p>I will not ſuffer you to ſay another word on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: your friendſhip, with that of my lady and Valentine, will be our beſt reward. I defy you, with all your riches, to give us any thing equal to that. But why do we longer delay ſitting down to table? Come, ſit Valentine here beſide your father. Yes, I underſtand you; Martha ſhall be near
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0277100500:110"/>you; the good creature loves you ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly! <stage>(Seeing Martha drying her eyes with her apron.)</stage> Come, wife, don't be fooliſh: why thoſe tears? we are not loſt to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; were he a worthleſs lad, then, indeed, he would be loſt to us, and we ſhould have reaſon to lament him.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Valen. </speaker>
                     <stage>(looking tenderly at Mr. Parks.)</stage>
                     <p>You ſee them, father: have I not reaſon to love them? <stage>(He lays hold of Martha's hand, who can no longer reſtrain her tears, and hides her face, whilſt Valentine is careſſing her with endearing fondneſs.)</stage>
                     </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, ſhall we have an end of this? the one is as great a fool as the other. Come, Martha, to divert you a little, ſeat the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and bring us ſome glaſſes. <stage>(Whilſt Martha is engaged, he turns to Mr. Parks,)</stage> I told you, Sir, juſt now, that virtue never failed of a reward; here you ſee a proof of it. You had ſcarcely performed a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before you were inſtantly recompenſed for it. You gave us property that was no longer ours, and we have given you an only ſon, whom you had conſidered as loſt. <stage>(He gets up, and addreſſing himſelf to George, Jenny, and Lucy, who, during this whole ſcene remain ſilent, with their eyes continually fixed on Mr. Parks or Valentine.)</stage> And you, my children,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0277100500:111"/>hence learn never to deſpair of heaven or yourſelves. When a flood, fifteen years ago, ſwept away my cottage, Providence gave me, at the ſame time, the means of requit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one day the man who was deſtined to be my benefactor. This day, when the effects of an unfavourable ſeaſon ſeemed to threaten me with hopeleſs deſtruction, it has, on the contrary, re-eſtabliſhed my little fortune. God makes uſe of every thing to reward thoſe who do their duty. It is from two of the moſt dreadful ſcourges that we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived our good fortune: let this be a leſſon to you all your lives! When a man acts right, though misfortune ſhould perſecute him, though the lightning ſhould flaſh round his head, and thunder ſhake every thing about him, ſo long as he has no reproach to make to himſelf, he remains firm as a rock, <stage>(ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the table)</stage> or if he falls for a moment, he riſes up again with new vigour—a glaſs of wine, Sir. <stage>(He takes up the bottle and fills round.)</stage> It is, that we may all drink your health.</p>

                     <p>I thank you, my dear boy; I thank you all, my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. How ſweet is the name of father! <stage>(He drinks.)</stage> No wine ever taſted ſo exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely to me.</p>

                     <p>Nor to me, therefore I will repleniſh to you now, Valentine. Hear what I ſay: though you are now become a great perſon, I will never ſuffer you to be called by any other name in my cottage. By calling you ſo, we ſhall be more ſenſible that you ſtill dwell in our hearts.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Valen.</speaker>

                     <p>But now I think of it, Sir, we related to you in what manner we found your ſon, it is now your turn to tell us how you loſt him.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Parks.</speaker>
                     <p>Moſt willingly, my friend, as the recital can no longer diſtreſs me: I had been married a year when a war broke out, and I received orders to proceed with my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment to the Weſt-Indies: my wife, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all entreaties, would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me in that long and dangerous voyage, after giving birth to this dear boy, the only
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0277100500:113"/>one that we have left. I had an uncle, a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitary of the church, who lived near Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; the infant was conſigned to a nurſe in his neighbourhood, that he might have an eye to him, and give us information about him. I received no account the three firſt years of my abſence. Uneaſy at ſo long a ſilence, I wrote to ſome friends in London: the moſt zealous of them viſited the place, whence he acquainted me, that ſoon after my departure, a ſudden inundation had ravaged the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that my uncle had fallen a victim to his intrepid exertions on that calamitous occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; that the houſe of the nurſe had been ſwept away by the flood, and that my ſon periſhed with her; this dreadful news op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed me with ſorrow, and almoſt broke my wife's heart. At my return to England, I was reſtrained from making any reſearches, which appeared uſeleſs, leſt my ill ſucceſs ſhould revive thoſe bitter ſorrows which time had ſomewhat alleviated.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>What, for ſix years that I have been your tenant, and might have put an end to your grief! I ſhall never forgive myſelf for having ſuffered you to pine ſo long. I often told you of my happineſs, why did you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mention your ſorrows to me?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Parks.</speaker>
                     <p>Could I have thought that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0277100500:114"/>you alone were capable of terminating them! And beſides, I muſt confeſs, that I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured all in my power to baniſh theſe ſad reflections from my mind. I was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly fearful of reviving them in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of my wife. This very morning, when you wanted to talk about your children, don't you recollect how cautiouſly I endeavoured to turn the converſation to other ſubjects?</p>

                     <p>It is to your inſtructions, my worthy friends, that I am indebted for his merit; it was under you he learned to reliſh ſentiments of honour and virtue. I have the

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>Reward us! Oh, that he has done a long time ſince; Valentine himſelf has taken care of that: night and day he has laboured all inches power for our benefit. Do you imagine that without his care and toil our fields would have proſpered as they have done?</p>

                     <p>No, father it is but right to tell you of what they, perhaps, would conceal, leſt they might again intereſt your generoſity of heart; all my efforts were due to them for their care and tenderneſs to me in my infant years, and I had no merit in working for them; but as induſtrious as they are, my hands were neceſſary to them: if they loſe my aſſiſtance, it is my duty to make them a compenſation—there is but one method: luckily it depends on the firſt favour I have to ſolicit at your hands, and you will not ſurely refuſe me in this joyful and happy moment; will you, father?</p>

It will give me the greateſt pleaſure to ſerve you: I can begin this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <speaker>Mrs W.</speaker>
                  <p>What, that he ſhould paſs the night in a gloomy wood? What would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the poor child? and what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
                  <p>You would both be cured. He of his vanity, and you of your injudicious fondneſs which keeps it up in him.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
                  <p>I am juſt now convinced of what I only ſuſpected in the morning. The boy's head is filled with exceſſive vanity, and all his reading is but oſtentation. He has only
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0277100500:136"/>loſt himſelf on purpoſe to make us look for him, and to appear abſent and forgetful through intenſe ſtudy. It gives me more pain that his mind ſhould wander from a right way of thinking than if his ſteps really went aſtray. He will be unhappy all his life if he is not cured of it in time, and there is nothing but a wholeſome humiliation that can ſave him.</p>

                  <p>But do you conſider—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, every thing. He is eleven years old. If he can profit any thing by his natural ſenſe or his learning, the light of the moon and the direction of the wind may guide him ſufficiently to clear the wood.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. W.</speaker>
                  <p>But if he has not that thought?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. W.</speaker>
                  <p>He will then better ſee the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of profiting by the leſſons that I have given him upon this ſubject. Beſides, we intend him for the army, and in that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he will have many nights to paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhelter. He will know what it is, and not go to a camp quite raw, to be laughed at by his companions. Then the air is not very cold at this ſeaſon of the year, and for one night he will not die with hunger. Since by his folly he has brought himſelf into a ſcrape, let him get out of it again, or ſuffer the diſagreeable conſequences of it.</p>

Colin too ſhall be at a ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in order to run to them in caſe of an accident. For any thing more, do not aſk it; I have taken my reſolution, and do not chuſe, by a blind weakneſs, to deprive my ſon of a leſſon that may be of ſervice to him.

                     <p>We were both going out laſt Saturday. I ſtopped to get a handkerchief: my brother went down ſtairs alone, and, as it happened, Roberts hearing ſome one, came out ſlily, jumped at once upon my brother, who was frighted, loſt his footing, and rolled down the ſtairs from top to bottom.</p>

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0277100500:154"/>Roberts looks for all the world as if he loved ſuch miſchief. We ſhall have his company this evening for the firſt time in our lives, his father begged papa to let him come and ſee us.</p>

                     <p>Yes, ſo he means to do, and therefore yeſterday gave warning; and now we are forbidden all manner of connection with this Roberts, he is ſo wicked! Would you think it, very few go by the houſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0277100500:155"/>being apprehenſive that he will put ſome trick upon them. Sometimes he diverts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by ſquirting puddle water at them, or elſe pelting them with rotten apples. Nay, he will ſometimes faſten rabbits tails or bits of rags behind their backs, at which the people, when they ſee it, all burſt out a laughing. Then too he has what he calls his <hi>caxen fiſhery.</hi>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Elder Danby.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes: he will take the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's wigs off, as they paſs him, with a hook, as you would carp. When any poor man ſtops before his window to converſe with an acquaintance, Roberts immediately goes up to the balcony, with a ſtring ſuſpended from a fiſhing-rod, and at the end of it a hook, with which he jerks the poor man's wig off. Then he runs and ties it to a dog that he has before provided for the purpoſe, after which he drives the creature out into the ſtreet, and off he ſets that inſtant, ſo that the poor perri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wig has frequently been dragged for twenty minutes through the mud, before its owner can lay hold of it again.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Frank.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Elder Danby.</speaker>
                     <p>And yet this is nothing to the ſtories that I could tell you. Why, he lames or bruiſes all the dogs and cats that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0277100500:156"/>come within his reach. Nor is it long ago, when one of his relations broke a leg, by ſlipping down upon the ſtairs where Roberts had been ſcattering peas on purpoſe. Ay, it is ſo; or elſe our name is not Danby. And for the ſervants, I am ſure, his father would not get one to attend him, if he did not pay extraordinary wages.</p>

                     <p>I can believe you: ſuch as he are always cowards. I compare him to a puppy following cloſe upon a cat as long as ſhe keeps running: but if once the cat turns

After he is blinded, you ſhall ſteal into the cloſet, take away the lights, and leave us both together. When I want your aid, I will call you.</p>

You have been diſreſpectful to theſe ladies, whom I need not ſay you ſhould have honoured and regarded. So be gone! Your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when he comes to know that you have been turned out of doors, will ſee how neceſſary it is to correct the vices of your heart. I will not permit your deteſtable example to corrupt my children. Go, and never let me ſee you here again! <stage>(Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts is confounded, and withdraws.)</stage> And you, my friends, although the circumſtances of the caſe may very poſſibly excuſe what you have done, yet never, for the time to come, indulge your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch ſport. The fears which have power to affect children at a tender age, may poſſibly be followed by the worſt conſequences during their whole life. Avenge yourſelves upon the wicked only by behaving better; and remember, after the example which maſter Roberts has afforded you, that by intending harm to others, you will ofteneſt bring it down upon yourſelves.</p>
