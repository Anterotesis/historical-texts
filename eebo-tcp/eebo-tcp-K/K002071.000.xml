            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE FIRST EPOCH.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt then of the ſix epochs or periods is that, which begins with the world and ends with the deluge,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0464101900:8"/>and comprehends the occurrences of 1656 years, that is to ſay, from Adam to Noah.</p>
                  <p>Not long after the fall of our firſt parents they had two ſons, CAIN and ABEL. The diſpoſitions of theſe two brothers were of a contrary caſt. Cain was of an ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricious, proud, impious turn of mind, whereas Abel was all meekneſs, humility and generoſity; now as the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, or homage offered to God, by the one, was more acceptable to him, than thoſe of the other, it occaſioned ſuch a jealouſy and hatred in Cain, that he ſought an opportunity to murder his brother.</p>
                  <p>The death of Abel armed the vengeance of the Lord againſt his murderer, and God to puniſh him, gave him over to the bittereſt remorſe. A man's conſcience, when keen, is a ſufficient puniſhment for almoſt any crime. To this conſcience Cain was committed, and we are told that his ſin ſo afflicted him, that it was <q>more than he was able to bear.</q> He was driven out from ſociety, and thus agitated by his fears, ſat about building the firſt city, as an aſylum from the hatred and perſecution of mankind.</p>
                  <p>Adam was conſoled for the loſs of Abel and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity of Cain by the birth of Seth, who was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond patriarch, or head of a family, before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.</p>
                  <p>The family of this man was virtuous and religious, whilſt that of Cain was the contrary; and it was not till the time of Enos, the third patriarch and ſon of Seth, that the true worſhip of God took place in the family of Cain. This was about 325 years after the creation.</p>
                  <p>The great great-grandſon of Enos, was Enoch the father of Methuſelah, he who was the longeſt liver, and died at the age of 969. This Enoch was taken up into heaven in a miraculous manner, ſoon after the death of Adam, who dying, at the age of 930, plunged mankind into a general nourning.</p>
                  <p>The death of Adam, the taking up of Enoch, and the old age of the other patriarchs, who till now, ſeemed to have kept men within certain bounds, gave a looſe to univerſal corruption. Nothing could check it.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0464101900:9"/>The virtuous fell in with the depravity of the vicious; in a word, impiety grew to ſuch an exceſs, that God, in equity of judgment, determined to extirpate this criminal race of men from the earth.</p>
                  <p>Among the whole there was only one good man. This was the patriarch Noah, the grandſon of Methu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaleh and of the tenth generation from Adam, by his ſon Seth: him God was pleaſed to favour and reveal to his deſign of deſtroying the world by an univerſal deluge, and that 120 years before it happened. In order to ſave this man and his family, he directed him to build a large veſſel, which we call an <hi>Ark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During this interval, Noah denounced to ſinners the terrible event that threatened them; but, they ſhut their ears to his ſalutary admonitions, and laughed at the dreadful account he held forth to them, till the horrible event took place. Noah alone, his wife, his three ſons and their wives, with a male and female of every animal then living were reſerved to re-people and re-ſtock the earth. This happened in the year of the world 1656, when Noah was about 600 years old.</p>

                     <p>I have heard the long lives of people living before the flood diſputed, and that that which we call a year, was a period of much ſhorter duration.</p>

                     <p>Such things <hi>have</hi> been advanced, but merely on conjecture. In the early ages of the world, when fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies on the earth were few, it was perhaps neceſſary, or at leaſt not attended with any inconvenience, that men ſhould live and beget children for eight or nine hundred years, in order to people the globe; but, was mankind to live now as long, it is evident from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſneſs of every country, that the earth would be over-ſtocked, and not large enough to provide for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. On this account, Providence has wiſely ſhortened our days and ordered that, there ſhall be no more inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants than the earth is capable of maintaining. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, God might then have thought proper to extend the lives of men to a very great age, in order to hand down to poſterity the wonders of his power and his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0464101900:10"/>goodneſs, which, as printing was then unknown, could not be otherwiſe done than by tradition.</p>
                     <p>The ten patriarchs, that lived before the flood, namely, Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methuſelah, Lamech, and Noah, (each of which was the ſon of the perſon preceding him.) were the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitaries of the holy law, before it was publiſhed on Mount Sinai; and of theſe ten, Adam lived 56 years after Lamech was born, and Lamech lived till Noah was 595 years old, that is, till within ſix years of the deluge; and as Noah lived 350 years afterwards, it is plain, that the hiſtory of above 2000 years was within the memory of three perſons; the accounts given therefore by theſe three men, corroborating the aſſertions of the other ſeven patriarchs, leave no room to doubt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity of their traditions.</p>
                     <p>So again of the ten patriarchs after the flood. Shem, the firſt patriarch, the ſon of Noah, lived 150 years after the birth of Abraham the tenth patriarch, whoſe ſon Iſaac was a cotemporay to Levi, the father, or grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father of Moſes. Hence it follows, that Moſes wrote nothing but that was in the memory of man; ſince he was not more than four or five generations removed from Abraham; and, Abraham being alive with many who had ſeen Noah and the deluge, and Noah with many that had ſeen Adam and the firſt ages of the world; it follows, that Adam could not be unknown to Noah and his ſon Shem, nor theſe, to Abraham or Jacob; nor Jacob to Moſes; particularly at a time, when this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition concerned their own family, and was the only hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory fathers could teach their children.</p>

                     <p>I have followed you, Sir, with attention, and ſee clearly that the hiſtory of the firſt ages of the world, have paſſed through too few hands to be altered, in the days of Moſes; not more than ſeven or eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from Adams to Moſes, a period of near 2500 years. —But, Sir, there is a new difficulty which ſtrikes me, and which I wiſh to have cleared up, and that is how ſo great a multitude of animals, as two of each ſpecies, which covered the earth, could be contained in the ark,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0464101900:11"/>ſo long as a year; which I underſtand the deluge conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued!</p>

                     <speaker>ERAST.</speaker>
                     <p>In the firſt place, it muſt be conſidered that, according to the dimenſions of the ark given us in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it was four times as large as a firſt-rate man of war, which is capable of containing ſeven or eight hundred men, with as many troops, with neceſſary proviſions for ſix months, and at the ſame time loaded with rigging, one hundred pieces of heavy cannon, and their proper ammunition; whereas, in the ark, were only eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, beſides the animals and their proviſions for a year.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, it muſt be underſtood, that the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſpecies of animals were not ſo numerous as have been thought. All the ſpecies of dogs, for example, may have ariſen from one ſpecies, as all the ſpecies of pears may have ſprung from the firſt pear-tree; or the different ſpecies of men from the ſame original.</p>

                     <speaker>EUGEN.</speaker>
                     <p>But, Sir, is it natural to conclude that men of different complexions, white, ſwarthy, copper-colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and black, ſprung from the ſame ſtock?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>ERAST.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes. Our exterior varieties are ſubject to change. We no way reſemble the ancient Britons of this country. This race of people has ceaſed by mixing with others. The Arabians, who lived a long time in Spain, and who were originally of a black caſt, have now retired to Morocco and Tunis. The natives of the weſtern part of Africa are <hi>blacker</hi> than they formerly were, thoſe about Tunis <hi>whiter.</hi> Where there is no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of people, the ſame colour has continued, but one alteration is ſufficient to deſtroy our concluſions, that men of different complexions <hi>muſt</hi> ſpring from different ſtocks.</p>
                     <p>No animal produced by two animals of a different kind, ever breeds: that is, mongrels never perpetuate their ſpecies; but, a bitch produced by a greyhound and a terrier will have young; of courſe, a greyhound and a terrier are, in fact, of the ſame ſpecies; we may ſay the ſame of a child born of a negro-woman and a white man. But let us continue the hiſtory of religion.</p>

                  <head>THE SECOND EPOCH.</head>
                  <p>Soon after the deluge, change of living, and <hi>animal</hi> food being ſubſtituted in the room of <hi>vegetable,</hi> with other cauſes, brought on a decreaſe in length of life. Some precepts were given to Noah; the confuſion of tongues happened at the tower of Babel in the year of the world 1878, which was the firſt monument of the pride and wickedneſs of men; and the allotment of diſtrict to the three children of Noah, was the firſt diſtribution of land.</p>
                  <p>An account of theſe firſt three founders of nations is ſtill preſerved. From Japhet, the eldeſt ſon of Noah, ſprung the inhabitants of the north of Europe and Aſia, as well as thoſe of the weſt; from Shem came the people of the eaſt, as alſo the Jews; and, from Ham and his ſon Canaan, deſcended the Canaanites, Philiſtines, Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the ancient poſſeſſors of Africa.</p>
                  <p>A little after this firſt diviſion of territory, that is about 1879 of the world, Nimrod, a man of ſavage diſpoſition, became the firſt of conquerors, and eſtabliſhed his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at Babylon. He was the father of Ninus, who found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Aſſyrian monarchy.</p>
                  <p>Every thing had a beginning; there is no hiſtory ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that has not veſtiges of the infancy of the world. We have ſeen laws eſtabliſhed, manners become poliſhed, and empires formed; men have riſen by degrees from a ſtate of ignorance; experience has improved them, and arts have multiplied and grown to perfection under their hands. In proportion as mankind encreaſed, mountains were paſſed, rivers and ſeas were traverſed, and new ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations were eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>The earth, which in the beginning was merely an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe foreſt, took on a new form. Woods grubbed up, gave place to fields, to meadows, to villages and towns; men employed themſelves in taking animals, taming them and making them uſeful. Meeting with oppoſition they firſt began their conteſt with wild beaſts. They next invented arms, then turned thoſe arms againſt each other, and took pride in war. Nimrod, the firſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior and the firſt conqueror, is called in ſcripture, <q>A
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0464101900:13"/>great hunter.</q> Afterwards, men found out the art of cultivation; converted metals to their uſe, and turned every article in nature to ſome advantage.</p>
                  <p>But though men enriched ſociety by the invention and improvement of arts, they on the other hand diſhonoured it by the greateſt exceſſes, till in the end, they drew upon them the vengeance of the Lord. In vain did the world, ſtill dripping as it were, with the waters of the deluge, in vain did the ſtriking decreaſe in the duration of human life, in vain did the overthrow of nature, ſtill preſent dreadful monuments of the juſtice of an irritated Creator. The knowledge of a Supreme Being was effa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the memory of man; ancient traditions were obſcured and forgotten, and fables took their place. Inſtead of paying that tribute of adoration to the <hi>Moſt-High</hi> which was due from all that breathed. they proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a ſacrilegious incenſe to animals, and by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable depravity, even kings fell down before them and worſhipped them. Scarce was found a family faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the God of Adam and of Noah; inſomuch, that the Father of nature, weary of threatning, waiting, and puniſhing, abandoned mankind and left them to their perverſeneſs.—Such was the unhappy progreſs of ſin in the ſhort ſpace of 426 years, the duration of this ſecond epoch.</p>

                  <head>THE THIRD EPOCH.</head>
                  <p>In the midſt of theſe crimes which ſullied the world, God, ever watchful for the preſervation of religion, perceived one juſt man of the family of Shem, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0464101900:14"/>through him determined to ſeparate the true worſhippers, from the reſt of mankind. This was Abraham, and he was choſen to be the ſtock and father of the faithful. This was in the year of the world 2108.</p>
                  <p>The Moſt-High called him into a country inhabited by the poſterity of Canaan, determining to eſtabliſh there his worſhip and the children of this patriarch, whom he had reſolved to multiply as the ſtars of heaven and as the ſand of the ſea. To the promiſe he made him of giving this land to his deſcendants, he added a more illuſtrious good, namely, that great bleſſing he beſtowed through him on all the human race; for, of Abraham's family Jeſus Chriſt was born.</p>
                  <p>From Jacob, the grandſon, of Abraham, and whom Iſaac his father bleſſed in preference to his elder brother Eſau, (thus executing the will of God, though he was apparently deceived into it) ſprang the Iſraelites or Jews, ſo called from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the name given him from his wreſtling with an angel, in the year of the world 2296.</p>
                  <p>After the death of Jacob, (whoſe ſon Joſeph had made ſuch a figure in the court of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and the adminiſtration of his government,) the houſe of Abraham became a great people, and multiplied ſo prodigiouſly, as to excite the jealouſy of the Egyptians. The Iſraelites or Hebrews faithful to their God, were in the very centre of the moſt monſtrous and abſurd ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, unjuſtly hated, and unmercifully perſecuted. But the Lord raiſed up Moſes as their protector and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer; having ſaved him from the waters of the Nile, where, by an order of the king, all the male children of the Iſraelites were thrown, with a deſign to defeat a prophecy, that one ſhould then be born, that ſhould reſcue the Iſraelites from their ſervitude. From the waters of the Nile, to which Moſes, then an infant, was committed, in the year of the world 2464, he fell under the notice of Pharaoh's daughter, there walking, who reſcued him from a watery grave, and brought him up as her own ſon.</p>
                  <p>For forty years, Moſes deſpiſed the riches of the court of Egypt; and, moved with the diſtreſſes of his brother
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0464101900:15"/>Iſraelites, whom Pharaoh continued to perſecute, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated every danger to comfort them. But they, far from profiting by his zeal and his reſolution, expoſed themſelves to the fury of Pharaoh, who was determined on their ruin. Moſes ſaved himſelf by flight; he fled into Arabia, where he paſſed forty years as a ſhepherd; at the end of which time, he ſaw the burning buſh, from the midſt of which God ſpake to him and directed him to return to Egypt, and free his brethren from their ſlavery.</p>
                  <p>The pains he took to effect this, his remonſtrances with Pharaoh, his puniſhment of that king, by bringing on his country the many plagues it endured, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting the Iſraelites acroſs the red ſea, where the water miraculouſly divided to the right and left, to ſuffer them to paſs through and united again, to drown Pharaoh and all his hoſt, attempting to follow them, in order to force them back, you are too well acquainted with, to need a repetition here. All that is neceſſary to know is, that Moſes through the interference of God, became the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer of the Jewiſh nation, after more than two ages of ſervitude, and 430 years after the calling of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. This was in the year of the world 2544; or, 1510 years before the birth of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>God having freed his people from the tyranny of the Egyptians, to conduct them to a land which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to their father, laid down the law which he would have them to follow.</p>
                  <p>In the journey of theſe Iſraelites (in number 600,000, beſides old men, women and children) God provided for them miraculouſly; he rained down manna, a kind of bread, from Heaven, and water guſhed out from rocks, at the command of their leader; nor did their cloaths wear out, but fitted them and their children during their whole journey, which took up the ſpace of forty years.</p>
                  <p>They no ſooner had paſſed the red ſea, and were free from the purſuit of the Egyptians, than God directed Moſes to aſcend Mount Sinai occaſionally, (the Iſraelites continuing at the foot of it,)where he delivered into his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0464101900:16"/>hands two tables of ſtone, on which he had engraved the decalogue, or ten commandments; and, at times, gave him ſuch other inſtructions as he thought neceſſary. This decalogue was by no means a new law, but that which God had written in the hearts of all men, long before; it containing only the firſt principles of man's duty to God and to his neighbour. His renewal of this law, and giving it in writing was becauſe the ignorance and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men had almoſt effaced it from their memory. In one of his viſits to the top of Sinai he continued forty days, during which the Iſraelites murmured, and fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Moſes had deſerted them, made a golden calf and fell down and worſhipped it. Moſes, on his return, to puniſh the guilty, called the children of Levi and ordered them to put the idolaters to death, which they did to the number of three thouſand.</p>
                  <p>After God had delivered the commandments to Moſes, he gave him other precepts, which he was to conſider as an explanation of the written law. He ordered him to build a temple or tabernacle to depoſit this law in; to erect an altar and ſtabliſh a prieſthood. To this office Moſes appointed his brother Aaron. Thus did God eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh ceremonies and an outward form of worſhip, and the Levites, the grand-children of Jacob by their father Levi, were conſecrated to ſerve at the altars.</p>
                  <p>After theſe great eſtabliſhments they purſued their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into the deſarts of Arabia. Before the completion of which Moſes died, and God appointed Joſhua his ſucceſſor, who ordered this hiſtory, which Moſes had begun, to be continued.</p>

                  <p>After the death of Joſhua, which happened ſoon after the eſtabliſhment of the Iſraelites in the land of Canaan, things went pretty ſmoothly on for a number of years.

As often as they returned to their duty, the Lord was their friend and deliverer, and whenever they failed in that duty, they became ſlaves to ſome ſovereign power.

                     <p>This peace, however, was in ſome meaſure interrupted by Alexander the Great, about 335 years before Chriſt, who, paſſing out of Europe, laid waſte the Perſian empire. Being on the march to Jeruſalem in order to beſiege it; the high-prieſt put on his prieſtly habit, and with a great number of people cloathed in veſtments went out to meet him. As ſoon as Alexander ſaw the high-prieſt, he fell proſtrate before him, ſaying, that whilſt he was in Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia, a man appeared to him in the very ſame habit, and invited him into Aſia, promiſing to deliver the Perſian empire into his hands: and the high-prieſt ſhewing him the prophecy of Daniel, <q>that a Grecian ſhould come and deſtroy the Perſians,</q> he was confirmed in the perſwaſion that he himſelf was the man. This led him to reſpect the temple he deſigned to pillage and deſtroy, and to ſupport the Jews in their privileges. In ſhort, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the Perſians, Darius was ſlain, and Alexander be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came univerſal monarch over the eaſtern world.</p>
                     <p>It was about this time, that is, about 277 years before Chriſt, that ſeventy Jews diſtinguiſhed for their learning, were employed by Ptolemy, king of Egypt, with conſent of the nation, to tranſlate the bible from its original He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew into Greek. It is from theſe called the <hi>Septuagint</hi> tranſlation. Hence the Jewiſh religion began to be the known among the Gentiles; the temple of Jeruſalem was enriched with gifts both from kings and people, and the Jews were reſpected every where.</p>
                     <p>Allured by the treaſures within the temple, Seleucus, king of Syria, ſent a perſon to bring it away; this man was ſtruck down by angels and almoſt killed, but at the prayers of the high-prieſt, ſoon after recovered.</p>

                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0464101900:22"/>Antiochus, however, who ſucceeded Seleucus, on the throne of Syria, conceived a deſign of deſtroying the Jewiſh nation, and dividing it's wealth among his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; he ſucceeded in his enterprize, ſacked the city, ſlew 40,000 of the inhabitants, took as many priſoners, pillaged the temple, and endeavoured to aboliſh the worſhip of God.</p>
                     <p>Matthias, and his ſon Judas Maccabeus, oppoſed the violence of this tyrant, and with a handful of ſoldiers, performed wonders, deſtroyed the army of Antiochus, and purified the temple, three years and an half after it's proſanation.</p>

                     <p>After this the Jews became a flouriſhing nation, and continued ſo with but few alterations or changes, till about 40 years before the birth of Chriſh, when Pompey, the Roman general, diſſpoſſeſſed Antiochus the laſt king of Syria, took Jeruſalem and made the Jews tributary to the Romans.</p>

This friend no ſooner ſaw her than he became deſperately in love with her, and forgetting his errand, made propoſals to her himſelf; his hand was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and they were privately married: returning, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to court and aſſuring the king, that ſhe was ſo far from handſome that he wondered the world could ſpeak of her, Edgar thought no more of her. Sometime afterwards he repreſented to the king, that though the fortune of the Earl of Devonſhire's daughter would be trifting to a monarch, yet it would be an immenſe ſum to a needy ſubject, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited his permiſſion to pay his court to her. Edgar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, Ethelwolfe returned to his wife, and their nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als were publickly ſolemnized. Now, though he had the precaution not to let her appear at court, his treachery was not long concealed, Edgar was made acquainted with the whole, but diſembling his reſentment, took an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of viſiting the part of the country where ſhe lived.

It was the ſanctity of Edward that gave riſe to the belief of ſo extraordinary a cure; and it was this, his continence and his pretending to have the gift of prophecy, that procured him a diſtinguiſhed place amodg the ſaints: he was called Edward the confeſſor.</p>
                     <p>On the death of Edward, in 1066, Harold the ſecond, the ſon of Earl Godwin, took poſſeſſion of the throne and with the conſent of the people. His brother Toſti alſo put in a claim for it as elder brother, but Harold was in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and though Toſti procured aſſiſtance from Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and invaded England in the north, it anſwered no purpoſe; the invaders were defeated at the battle of Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and were obliged to retire; but the joy of this vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory was ſoon damped, by the news that Williams, duke of Normandy had landed at Haſtings, in Suſſex, with a great army, determined to ſupport his claim to the crown, from the nomination of Edward. This happened Sep. 28. 1066.</p>

                     <p>He was the natural ſon of Robert, duke of Normandy, by a tanner's daughter. Harold returned from the north, with all the forces he could muſter, and gave him battle on the 14th day of October following, at Haſtings. William ſent an offer to Harold to decide the diſpute by ſingle combat, and ſpare the effuſion of the peoples blood, but Harold refuſed, and ſaid he would leave it to the determination of God. Numerous were the forces on both ſides, and great was the conteſt. William had three horſes killed under him, and loſt 15000 men. Harold loſt near 60,000; he was as active and brave as man could be, but was conquered after all. Making a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0464101900:33"/>furious onſet at the head of his troops, he was ſhot through the ſkull with an arrow, and all the courage of the Engliſh died with him.</p>

William, to gratify his followers from Normandy, had diſpoſed of the eſtates of thoſe who fell in the battle of Haſtings, among them. He gave each a certain quantity of land, with all the inhabitants dwelling on that land; ſo that theſe inhabitants, were wholly at the will of their Lord, and they were called his bondmen. For this land, the Lord was obliged to arm his vaſſals and march out in defence of the king, whenever he pleaſed to call upon them; ſo, that each lord of a diſtrict, or baron was the head of a little army: this manner of holding lands is called, <hi>feudal tenure,</hi> and was an improvement of that ſtate of villenage, of which I have already ſpoken; for at this time there was no ſtanding army.</p>

Pope Urban II. himſelf preached the neceſſity of this holy war, and numberleſs perſons of all degrees and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ardently embraced the cauſe, and put on the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs, the badge of their profeſſion. Among this number was Robert, duke of Normandy. In order to ſupply money for this expenſive undertaking, he offered to mortgage his dukedom to his brother William, for a ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated ſum. William, eagerly embraced the propoſal. He raiſed the money upon the clergy of this kingdom, and when his brother was gone, took peaceable poſſeſſion of his dukedom.</p>
                     <p>In this manner, was Normandy again united to the Engliſh crown, and from this union, afterwards aroſe thoſe wars with France, which for whole centuries, continued to depopulate both nations.</p>

                     <p>There were now two competitors for the Throne, Robert, who was engaged in the holy war, and Henry the youngeſt brother, who remained at home. Henry, however, took poſſeſion of it, and endeavoured to ſecure that poſſeſſion, by gaining the affections of the people. He therefore once more confirmed the Saxon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aws, and indulged the clergy, in all their former privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges.</p>
                     <p>On Robert's return from the holy land, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to be crowned king of Jeruſalem, he found himſelf deprived of a kingdom, which, as elder brother to Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, he conſidered as his birth-right. He could not, however, recover it, nor his dukedom of Normandy; but in his attempt was taken priſoner, and confined twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix years in Cardiff-caſtle, in Wales, where he died.</p>
                     <p>To defend his poſſeſſions in Normandy, Henry was obliged to wage war with France, and during one of the engagements a French cavalier perſonally attacked the king, and ſtruck him twice on the head, with ſuch force that all his armour ſtreamed with blood. Henry, however, no way intimidated, continued the ſingle combat with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and, ſummoning all his ſtrength, levelled ſuch a blow at his antagoniſt as threw him from his horſe, and the king took him priſoner. This decided the victory, in favour of the Engliſh, and haſtened a peace.</p>
                     <p>Henry now returning victorious from abroad, brought with him a numerous retinue of the nobility. In one of the veſſels of the fleet, his only ſon and ſeveral young noblemen, his companions, went together to render the voyage more agreeable. The young prince, deſirous to be firſt a-ſhore, promiſed the ſeamen a reward, if they came in foremoſt. This emulation was fatal to them all; the pilot ran the ſhip upon a rock, and immediately ſhe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0464101900:39"/>was daſhed to pieces. The prince, however, was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a boat, and would have eſcaped, had he not been called back by the cries of Matilda, his ſiſter, who was married to the emperor of Germany, Henry V. and who was ther in the ſame ſhip; he prevailed upon the ſailors to row back to take her in; and the approach of ſave their lives, ſeveral leaped in, ſo that the boat was over-loaded, and all except one, went to the bottom. The prince was eighteen years old. When Henry was informed of this, he cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his face and never laughed afterwards.</p>

                     <p>The veſſel in which ſhe was, eſcaped, and Matilda in it. The emperor ſoon after dying, ſhe was married to Geoffrey of Plantagenet, earl of Angou; by him ſhe had a ſon, named Henry. The king obliged the nobility to take an oath to ſupport his daughter on the throne, after his deceaſe, which they did, by obſerved it no longer than whilſt they were obliged to obey. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry did not long ſurvive this, but died in the year 1135.</p>
                     <p>During the reign of Henry, the barons and the clergy were growing into power. each was a petty tyrant over thoſe who held under him. In order, therefore, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm privileges ſo lately acquired, they joined in electing a king, who might owe his ſceptre to them. They fixed on Stephen, nephew to the deceaſed king; and as for their oaths to Matilda, (or Maude, as ſhe was called,) the biſhops gave them an abſolution.</p>
                     <p>The kingdom now began to wear the face of ariſtoracy, in which the barons and clergy might be ſaid to command. They built caſtles, fortified and garriſoned them with their own troops, from whence, when offended, they would bid their monarch defiance.</p>

                     <p>He could not help himſelf; he oppoſed their meaſures, took ſome of their caſtles by force; but as the people were dependant on the barons, the king could make but little head againſt them. Matilda now claimed the crown in purſuance of her father's diſpoſal of it. She came over from Normandy with an armed force, and took
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0464101900:40"/>poſſeſſion of the caſtle of Arundel, in Suſſex. A civil war was the conſequence, a victory was obtained againſt the king; and though he fought with a party of the enemy with the utmoſt intrepidity, performing more than could be expected from a ſingle arm, his ſword flying in pieces he was obliged to ſurrender himſelf a priſoner. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror conducted him from the field and ignominiouſly ſaid him in irons.</p>
                     <p>Matilda was now proclaimed queen but as ſhe diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to accept the ſhadow of royalty, and the barons and clergy intending to grant no more, offence was ſoon given. Matilda was obliged to quit England again, Stephen was releaſed and once more placed upon the throne.</p>
                     <p>Stephen, like Matilda, not caring to ſubmit to the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of his ſubjects; the barons invited over Henry, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda's ſon, then twenty one years of age, who had been long acknowledged as duke of Normandy. He ſoon land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a formidable army, and another civil war would have enſued, had it not been agreed on by all parties, that Stephen ſhould enjoy the crown for life, and that Henry ſhould be his ſucceſſor. Stephen's death, the year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſoon put his rival in poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Henry Plantagenet aſcending the throne of England in 1160, by hereditary ſucceſſion and with the univerſal aſſent of his people; and, conſcious of his ſtrength, began to aſſume thoſe privileges which had been torn from the crown, through the weakneſs of his predeceſſors.</p>

                     <p>He demoliſhed the caſtles, diſmiſſed all foreign troops, reſumed the crown lands, and enacted ſome laws by which the people became, in ſome meaſure, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the barons. He chartered ſeveral towns, and laid the ground-work of Engliſh liberty. Having thus dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the power of the barons, by enlarging that of the people, he undertook to humble the clergy. He propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that the biſhops ſhould not be permitted to go to Rome; that no ſubject ſhould appeal to the Pope; that no officer of the crown, ſhould be excommunicated, or ſuſpended by the clergy; and, that the clergy themſelves ſhould be ſubject to the temporal judge. Theſe propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0464101900:41"/>were agreed to; Becket, archbiſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, however, a powerful and haughty man, not caring to ſubmit, was condemned as a traitor; but, eſcaped puniſhment, by flying his country.</p>
                     <p>The Pope (Alexander III.) eſpouſed Becket's quarrel; and, after a variety of conferences and negociations; with threats and excommunications on the part of the Pope, which continued ſome years, Henry thought proper to acquieſce and pardon him. The archbiſhop then made his way into London, amidſt the exclamations of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He was no ſooner however re-inſtated in his power, than he excommunicated two of the nobility, and ſuſpended ſeveral of the biſhops who had been his enemies. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was made to the king, then in Normandy, and four gentlemen at the inſtance of Henry, as is ſuppoſed, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to curb his inſolence: they haſtened to England, entered the cathedral of Canterbury, where he was offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, and with a few attendants, beat out his brains, with clubs, at the foot of the altar.</p>
                     <p>His death confirmed thoſe privileges to the clergy, which his oppoſition could not do. He was conſidered as a martyr to his cauſe, and to have fallen by the hand of Henry.</p>
                     <p>In order to diveſt the attention of the public from ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions of this nature, Henry undertook the conqueſt of Ireland; a project formed ſome years before, but deferred on account of his long-protracted quarrel with Becket. The more readily to gain the Pope's conſent to this, (for nothing then could be done without the ſanction of Rome) he made oath, that he was no way concerned in the aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this archbiſhop, and made a ſolemn vow, to go bare-footed to Becket's tomb, and there receive the chiſcipline of the church; he kept his vow, and ſometime after was whipped by the Monks accordingly.</p>
                     <p>Having abtained the Pope's conſent, he ſubdued Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with a rapidity equal to his wiſhes; but the happineſs he received from this new acceſſion of power, was ſoon allayed, by a conſpiracy in his own family. This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch had not many vices, but gallantry was one of them. His queen was diſagreeable, and Henry was faithleſs.

                     <p>Richard, was ſome time after engared in a French war, and whilſt he was abroad, an inſurrection took place in London, owing to a new tax which the people diſliked.

                     <p>At the ſiege of Chaluz, near Limoges, Richard received a wound on the ſhoulder, with an arrow, of which he died, after a turbulent reign of ten years.</p>

When the king was excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, the Pope abſolved his ſubjects from their allegiance, forbad them to obey, and gave away his kingdom to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                     <p>What the Pope had formerly done, the barons thought proper to do now; they offered the crown of England to France, and Philip accepted it with joy; but, fearing the Pope's diſpleaſure, he prevailed on the Engliſh barons to elect his ſon Louis. In this they agreed, and the city of London lent it's aſſiſtance. Louis landed in England with a large army, in 1216; John was depoſed, and Louis was crowned at London; which ſo affected John's ſpirits that it occaſioned his death the ſame year, in the fifty firſt year of his age, after having reigned ſeventeen years.</p>

                     <p>At the death of his father, Edward I. was engaged in the holy war, where he was wounded, and, as it is ſaid, with a poiſoned arrow, and that his queen Eleanor, who was preſent, healed the wound by ſucking out the poiſon with her mouth.</p>
                     <p>On his return to England, he took poſſeſſion of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputed throne, and being ſatisfied with moderate power, laboured only to be terrible to his enemies; he marched againſt the Welch, and defeated them; killed their king, and annexed it's principality to the crown of England, giving the title of prince of Wales, to his eldeſt ſon.</p>
                     <p>His next attention was beſtowed on Scotland, where there were two competitors for the throne. Bruce and Baliol. Edward was umpire between them, that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the difference, and fixed the crown on the head of Baliol, leſs as a king, than as a vaſſal of England. But this bringing on a civil was in that country, Edward marched there, with a numerous army, and had nearly conquered it, intending to unite it with England, but death interrupted his career, in the 69th year of his age, and 35th of his reign.</p>
                     <p>It is to Edward I. however, that we owe the great power of the people; finding the cleargy and barons were rivals, he ſtudied to weaken their force; for this purpoſe he threw weight into the ſcale of the commons, and law was enacted, that no tax ſhould be levied without their conſent: his deſign was to render himſelf abſolute by their aſſiſtance; but he died and left the people a ſhare of authority, which was given them for very different pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed than the promotion of liberty.</p>
                     <p>He was ſucceeded in 1307, by his fourth ſon, Edward II. By his mal-adminiſtraction, and countenancing ſome favourites in oppoſition to the barons, he brought on a civil war; battles were fought, many noble priſoners ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on both ſides, and the ſcaffolds were drenched with

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0464101900:61"/>an inſolent and factious ariſtocracy was humbled; wiſe laws were enacted, commerce reſtored, and peace and happineſs introduced to a people little better than in a ſtate of barbariſm for thirteen hundred years before.</p>
                     <p>Henry's firſt care was to marry the princeſs Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV. thus uniting the intereſts of the houſes of Lancaſter and York. He has been accuſed of avarice, but perhaps unjuſtly ſo. Before his reign, it was uſual, for high treaſon, to take away the life of the aggreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and give away his fortune to ſome court favourite. This, Henry perceived had two bad effects, it excited re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment by it's cruelty, and made a favourite too power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for ſubjection; to avoid this he deprived ſuch as were taken in arms of their property, and reſerved it for the uſe of the crown. He was a great economiſt, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled him not only to be uſeful to the poor, but juſt to his own creditors.</p>
                     <p>Immediately after his marriage, he iſſued out a general pardon to all who would accept of it, but thoſe who flew to arms were quelled, and ſome of the ring-leaders exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
                     <p>Sagacious however as Henry was, he was jealous of his power, and though the earl of Warwick, a ſon of the duke of Clarence, Edward the IVth's brother, was only a boy, and nothing alledged againſt him, ſtill as he was related to the houſe of York, he ſhut him up a cloſe priſoner in the tower. This youth was however made an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to deceive the people. A prieſt of Oxford, had trained up one Lambert Simnel, a baker's ſon, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit the perſon of this earl, and having prepared him for his purpoſe, he ſat out for Ireland, and there opened the ſcene. The plot unfolded to his wiſh, Simnel was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and proclaimed king, and was conducted by the people and officers of ſtate, with great pomp to the caſtle.</p>

Judge then of the importance of morality, which teaches us how to live well, ſo that we may die well. But there are other ſciences ſtill, which are not only uſeful, but entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We will run through them as you ſeem to wiſh it.</p>
                     <p>We will begin with Writing; which, indeed, is rather one of the liberal arts; it is truly the art of painting words, and of ſpeaking to the eyes, and is one of the fineſt inventions of man. To read well, is alſo very uſeful. Good reading is, as it were, a comment upon the ſubject, it explains it as it goes on. Beſides to read ill is a mark of want of education, and nothing is ſo vulgar; it looks as if we did not underſtand what we read.</p>
                     <p>A principal perfection in writing is orthography. Can you tell me in what this conſiſts?</p>

                     <speaker>ERAST.</speaker>
                     <p>It is. To write correctly and grammatically, to ſpell the words properly, and uſe right ſtops, is a mark of good ſenſe and a good education. It is the firſt thing we judge by. Now the beſt way to acquire this, is to accuſtom ourſelves to copy, with attention, ſome pages of a book correctly printed. Nothing ſerves more to mark a gentleman and man of underſtanding, than a proper choice of words. This is chiefly acquired by reading, but to aſſiſt on this ſubject, let me recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to a book I have publiſhed for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it points out THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN WORDS ESTEEMED SYNONIMOUS in the Engliſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and will be found of uſe to ſuch as wiſh to ſpeak or write with propriety and elegance.<note n="*" place="bottom">Sold by <hi>R.

                     </p>
                     <p>Another knowledge as neceſſary as writing, is, Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic, without which a tradeſman cannot carry on his

England has two, Oxford and Cambridge; Scotland has four, Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, Glaſgow, Aberdeen, and St. Andrews; and Ireland has one, eſtabliſhed at Dublin. Each of theſe Univerſities conſiſts of one or more colleges, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain endowments. Government having granted them charters, with certain privileges, large ſums of money have been given from time to time by well diſpoſed perſons, to found certain houſes or colleges in thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Each of theſe col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges are, through noble contributions of the rich, in poſſeſſion of eſtates ſufficient to maintain a certain number of perſons called Fellows, who live together in ſociety, and who employ themſelves in educating young men, either in law, phyſic, or divinity. Such as go there for ſtudy, pay for their education, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage perſons to ſend their ſons to theſe places, there are certain privileges annexed to thoſe on whom the Univerſities ſhall be pleaſed to confer a degree or mark of diſtinction. A clergyman cannot hold two livings unleſs he has taken the degree of Maſter of Arts, or Batchelor of Laws, in one of our Univerſities; nor can he be made a biſhop, until he has taken a Doctor's degree; ſo likewiſe in phyſic. A phyſician cannot practice as ſuch, until he has taken the degree of a Doctor of phyſic. And before theſe degrees are given, the candidates for thoſe honours are examined as to their proficiency in the ſcience they profeſs.</p>

                     <p>Thus are towns ſupplied with proviſions. Take notice what a variety of articles we draw from the country.

                     <p>Is it not right that they ſhould profit by the fruit of their labours? We ought to be obliged to them, even though we pay them, for they work for us as well as for themſelves. But let us paſs to the beaſt market. I ſee a prodigious multitude of horſes, cows, ſheep, and pigs. What a crowd of people there is about them!

                     <p>Certainly: The better a market is ſerved, the greater the variety; we can then have ſuch cattle as we want, and ſuch as pleaſe us beſt. Every perſon here in laying out his money, helps the tradeſman and artiſt to live; for thoſe who receive money for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions they bring to market, lay it out again in the ſame town, for the neceſſaries and conveniences they want.</p>
                     <p>To accommodate the people in all towns is the reaſon of eſtabliſhing markets once or twice a week; and beſides theſe ſtated days weekly, there are particular markets at certain times of the year, called Fairs: Theſe fairs are authoriſed by government, and are eſtabliſhed for the benefit of the neighbourhood where they are held, and for the convenience of ſelling that merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe that is produced in the places round about.

                     <p>It was. A ſingle river, which nature alone has formed, is not, in general, ſo ſtrait nor ſo conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the paſſage of boats. Rivers generally wind a great deal, and have a number of ſhallow places that are difficult to paſs; beſides, rivers do not always run from town to town as theſe canals are made to do. Here the banks are made for the purpoſe of horſes to draw the barges along, and with wharfs for the convenience of loading and unloading them. See how the merchandiſe is ranged in different places; timber, firewood, bricks, paving ſtones, ſand, coals, and other things which are here to be conveyed away in waggons to the places they are going to.</p>

                     <p>Very much ſo. Towns where there is a port as well as a canal, that is, where a navigable river joins it, flouriſh very much, for ſuch rivers bring a variety of things from the ſea and other places out of the reach of a canal, and commerce in ſuch a town is much more extended.</p>

So that each of theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen have one hundredth ſhare in ſuch canal, and the profit ariſing from the toll, after the expences of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the banks, &amp;c. in repair, is divided among them, in proportion to their ſhares. By which means they get often a large intereſt for the uſe of the money ſo advanced; and they can ſell their ſhares at any time. Turnpike roads are made by the ſame means, and the toll paid at the gates is the property of the perſons who contribute to make the road. Before turnpikes were made, the roads were impaſſible; no one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould grudge a few pence for the convenience of good roads. Turnpikes are now made from town to town all over the kingdom, and, in proceſs of time, canals will be as general. But if you would ſee a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial ſcene indeed, you muſt go to a ſea-port.</p>

                     <p>The longitude of any place is its diſtance, eaſt or weſt from the port we ſail. And to find this out, we calculate by the pace or rate that the ſhip goes at. Knowing how far diſtant the place is to which the ſhip is going, ſeamen take notice, at ſeveral periods through the day and night, how faſt the veſſel ſails, as whether ſhe goes ſix, ſeven, or eight miles an hour, more or leſs. This is found by throwing what is called the log line, which is a line with a knot at certain diſtances, wound off a reel into the water at the ſhips ſide, by a minute glaſs, and in proportion as the ſhip runs from the knots in this line, each of which is a mile,

When government has eſtabliſhed a tax to pay the intereſt of the money they wiſh to borrow, they call upon the public to lend them the money, upon the faith and credit of the nation. When this ſum of money is advanced, it is called <hi>Stock,</hi> and government every half year pays the intereſt of this ſtock to the perſons poſſeſſed of it.

All that God thought proper to communicate to Moſes and the prophets by inſpiration, we call <hi>Revelation.</hi> His holy Spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened their minds, and taught them ſuch things as they wiſhed to know, and to teach to others; ſo that men who would ſpeak of the origin of the world, without an attention to revelation, let them be as wiſe as they may, can only ſet forth falſe ſyſtems, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy one another, and are little elſe than dreams of the imagination; whereas, by the recital of Moſes, ſo ſimple, and at the ſame time ſo ſublime, the formation of the univerſe unfolds itſelf to us in a very ſatisfactory man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. We will contemplate then, to day, the works of the Lord, the ſole author and preſerver of nature: And we will firſt turn our thoughts to the heavens, which declare his power and his glory. What other hand, what other force than his could ſupport, in the infinite expanſe above, thoſe great globes which we fee? What other wiſdom could regulate their courſe and preſerve that regularity, with which they have rolled in that immenſe ſpace for ſix thouſand years?</p>

You muſt have taken notice, that when we were in a boat, the ſhore we looked at and every thing upon that ſhore, ſeemed to move the contrary way to that we were going; for ſuch is the wiſe direction of Providence, that partaking of the motion of the earth in common with the earth, we are not ſenſible of its moving, and of courſe are led to ſuppoſe that the objects move, on which we look. The earth whirls round at the rate of 900 miles an hour, and were we to be ſenſible of its motion the conſequences would be very bad. Indeed, every thing upon it, partakes of the common motion of the globe itſelf, and is not any way affected by that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the ſame manner as no alteration takes place in any thing on board a ſhip, let the ſhip move as faſt as it will. A bottle of water, for example, hung up, or board a veſſel, to empty itſelf, drop by drop, into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bottle placed under it, with a narrow neck, the drops will all fall directly into the bottle, though the ſhip ſhall have run many inches whilſt the drop was in the air.</p>

                     <p>The Latitude is the diſtance of any one place from the Equator, or a ſuppoſed line, drawn round the globe of the earth, in the middle between the two poles or ends; that is, the diſtance from north to ſouth. To have a proper idea of this, you muſt conſider the earth as round or globular, and that there is a fixed ſtar in the north part of the heavens, called the Pole-ſtar. When we are at the Equator, or middle of the earth, this pole-ſtar appears level with the ground we ſtand on; but as we travel towards it, that is, to the north, this ſtar is obſerved to riſe higher in the heavens; but were we to turn our backs upon it and travel to the ſouthward, that is, from it, we ſhould ſoon loſe ſight of it, as the roundneſs or ſwell of the earth would hide it from our view. In this caſe we ſhould ſee a variety of ſtars, that, in our preſent northern hemiſphere or ſituation, we can never ſee; and the more we continued our journey ſouthwards, the more new ſtars would ariſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n view; but on our return towards the north, we ſhould loſe them again. Now, as when placed in the Equator or the middle of the earth, the pole-ſtar appears on a level with the ground we ſtand on, ſo as we travel northward, or towards it, it appears to riſe higher in the heavens, and by meaſuring its height, which is done by an inſtrument made for that purpoſe, called a <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>uadrant,</hi> we can tell exactly how far we have travelled northward, for every degree the pole-ſtar is riſen in the heavens, we have travelled ſixty miles from the Equator, ſo that when we arrive in England, and meaſure the height of this ſtar, and find it fifty-one degrees and a half; which is the height of the pole-ſtar with us, we know that we are about 3100 miles diſtant from the middle of the earth.</p>
                     <p>I will endeavour to explain this better by compariſon. Suppoſe the weathercock on a church-ſteeple to be ſeen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0464101900:141"/>the ſteeple will appear, and the weather-cock will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently riſe higher. In like manner, the higher we get and the more we get over the hill, the higher will the weather-cock appear, as the body of the church will he then ſeen under it. Let the weather-cock be now the north or pole-ſtar, and the hill, the ſwell or rotundity of the earth, as the further we advance upon the hill, and travel towards the weather-cock, the higher it ſeems to be, ſo the further we travel towards the ſtar, and riſe over the rotundity of the earth, the higher will the pole-ſtar appear in the heavens, and of courſe, the height of the ſtar will meaſure the length of way we have travelled.</p>

However, the general opinion is, that the ſun, and particularly the moon, are moſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the flux and reflux of the ſea.

                     <p>No; it has a greater attraction at new and full moon, than at the firſt or third quarter; for the ſituation of the moon, with the reſpect to the ſun, at the new and full, is ſuch, that the ſun conſpires with the moon at thoſe times to attract the waters, and cauſes a higher tide, than when the moon is in the firſt or third quarters. At new and full moon, the tides are called <hi>ſpring-tides,</hi> and riſe nine or ten feet above the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of the water, at low-water mark. When the moon is in the firſt and third quarter, the water does not riſe ſo high, and the tides are then called <hi>neap-tides.</hi> From the time of neap-tide to that of ſpring-tide, the water riſe every tide more and more; till they get to the higheſt; from ſpring-tide to neap-tide, they gradually fall more and more.</p>

                     <p>Water-ſpouts are a great quantity of water drawn up into the air, by the attraction of a low cloud, which ſeems to deſcend for that purpoſe; at a diſtance it appears like a large funnel, the ſmall end touching the ſea, the broad end enveloped in the clouds. Under the ſmall end the water bubbles up, and appears to boil. Was a ſhip to run foul of one of theſe ſpouts, the waters would break, deluge the veſſel, and probably ſink it. Seamen generally fire a ſhot at it when within reach, and thus diſperſe it, which the agitation of the air, by the exploſion, ſeldom fails to do.</p>

                     <p>This owes its origin to the load-ſtone; a ferruginous ſtone found in iron mines, which has the power of attracting iron. The virtue of this ſtone was known to the ancients. Pliny ſays, it was diſcovered by chance, from a ſhepherd's finding that the nails of his ſhoes, and the iron ferule of his ſtaff, clung to a load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, over which he walked, but they were ignorant of that ſingular property it poſſeſſes of turning towards the poles. We do not know to whom to attribute this important diſcovery. The invention of the compaſs is given to a Dutchman, in the year 1229. It is an iron needle or hand, like the hand of a clock, fixed on a point, ſo as to run round; and one end being touched by the loadſtone, which communicates its virtues to it, makes it always turn to the north. Thus a mariner, knowing what way he is to go, is always directed, though he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>es no land. And what revolutions in things has the loadſtone produced! It has made us acquainted with the new world: before this invention, ſeamen never ventured out of ſight of land; but now they have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed the whole globe. It is to this we are indebted to,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0464101900:165"/>not only for the diſcovery of new countries, but for the rich mines of gold and ſilver, which theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries produce, and which would have been loſt to us, if we had never reached thoſe ſhores.</p>

                     <p>If you pleaſe; and we will penetrate its very bowels.

                     <p>I could name many, for example, the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiowary, one of the talleſt and largeſt birds in India. I have ſeen one in the king of France's Muſeum, more than five feet high. The Caſſiowary is remarkable for its long black ſhining feathers, that reſemble hair; but of all birds, the talleſt is the Oſtrich, common in Africa, although its body is rather ſmall. The Oſtrich, like the Caſſiowary, does not fly; but both are ſo ſwift of foot, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> is difficult to keep up with them, even on the fleeteſt horſes. Oſtrich feathers are large and beautiful. We dye them of various colours, and uſe them for ornament: its down or hair ſerves to make hats or bonnets. This bird, like many others, will ſwallow iron, flint, and other hard ſubſtances, in order to aſſiſt digeſtion, but they do not digeſt it, as people have ſuppoſed. They ſay alſo, erroneouſly, that the imprudent Oſtrich depoſits its eggs in the ſand, and leaves them to the care of the ſun; when it is certain that they ſit on them in the night, though they leave them in the day, knowing that burning heat of the climate is ſufficient to hatch them.</p>

There is in all hives the mother Bee, which is called the queen, ſhe is larger, longer, and brighter coloured than the reſt.

The Bees have ſuch an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to their queen or common parent, that was ſhe to die, they would diſperſe or ſuffer themſelves to periſh. Wherever ſhe goes, they will follow her. Some men have ſearched for this queen Bee and having found it, placed it on their arm, and the whole ſwarm have there followed it. They will not ſting, unleſs rudely treated or roughly handled. When the hive it too full of Bees, the young ones will ſwarm out and eſtabliſh themſelves in ſome other place. Bees are very uſeful on account of the honey and the wax that they yield, and which they collect from flowers and depoſit in the money combs within the hive.</p>

Different countries have different ſpecies of Serpents: there are ſome which we have no reaſon to dread, they are ſo familiar. Some are winged, others amphibious.

The Aſp is another ſpecies of ſerpent which the ancients conſidered is one of the moſt venemous. They ſay it throws the perſon they bite into a lethargic ſtate, and thus deſtroys

The oil and powder of the Scorpion, whoſe bite is mortal, are excellent remedies. We cure the wound made by many animals, by bruiſing them upon the wound. Viper oil is a cure for the bite of a Viper.

Would you believe, that in a drop of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of an herb, of vinegar, or of blood, we diſcover by a glaſs, a multitude of animalcula or ſmall animals of different kinds, which move with great agility. Millions of inſects are ſpread thoughout the air, where they are inviſible, and the eggs which they depoſit in liquors, are hatched there by fermentation. In ſhort, when we come to conſider that every one of theſe living atoms has eyes, and the different parts of an organized body, that there are in theſe ſeveral parts, muſcles, nerves, veins, blood, and all things of which an animal body conſiſts, and almoſt imperceptible; what are we to think of the ſupreme artiſt that formed them!</p>

                     <p>It is natural ſo to do. Among theſe you muſt be ſenſible we owe the firſt rank to horned beaſts, and thoſe which furniſh us with wool. How great is this benefit to man! If a hen is a little treaſure to him, by laying, as ſome will, 300 eggs in a year, a cow is a great one, ſhe ſupplies us with milk, with butter, and with cheeſe, and gives us each year a calf. What a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0464101900:189"/>conſumption is there at our tables of beef and veal! What is more healthy or more nouriſhing! If we are in want of horſes to cultivate the land, or draw heavy burthens, the ox comes to our aſſiſtance. It is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in draught in many countries. Though ſlower, it is capable of more fatigue than a horſe, and is fed at leſs expence. After he has worked ſome years, he is fatted and killed, and his fleſh is brought to market. Neither do his ſervices end with his life, his ſkin tanned is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable; this gives leather. In ſhort, the gall, the blood, the fat, the bones, the horns, the guts, the hair, and even the dung of this animal, is converted to ſome uſeful purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>A agree with you as to ſervices of ſtrength; but in every other reſpect, this animal ſo timid and which ſeems ſo pitiful in itſelf, is very valuable to man, ſince it ſupplies us, at the ſame time, with food and raiment, not to mention the other advantages we draw from its tallow, its ſkin, its guts, and its bones. The fleſh of mutton is light, ſucculent, and of eaſy digeſtion. The milk of the ſheep is ſweet and wholeſome; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fides, we know that the wool is one of the greateſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of commerce, and how much its uſe is extended. It is different in quality, and Sheep themſelves vary very much in different climates; we call the male of the Sheep, a Ram. Many Sheep have horns upon their heads; ſome are covered with hair inſtead of wool. In Spain the wool is much finer than with us, and our beſt cloths are made of Spaniſh wool. The Tails of the Sheep at the Cape of Good Hope, weigh fifteen or twenty pounds, and are broad enough to turn back and cover their whole backs. In Tartary ſuch tails have weighed near eighty pounds.</p>

There are many Elephants in Aſia and Africa, but thoſe of the Eaſt Indies are the largeſt. The figure of an Elephant is unlike that of every other quadruped. It is a heavy maſs, without proportion. It has two great teeth on each ſide of its mouth, which are its weapons of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Beſides this, it has a long noſe like a tube, with which it takes up its food, and which it uſes as a hand. The Elephant eats a great deal, though it can ſtay ſeven or eight days without eating or drinking. Although very heavy, it is ſwift of foot, and can gallop, but it does not turn readily. This animal, though wild, is very docile, being eaſily tamed. There is nothing to fear from it, but when it is irritated. We derive great ſervices from the prodigious ſtrength of the Elephat.

Quakers, admit of no preachers, but ſuch as think themſelves inſpired; they are called Quakers, from their affecting to quake, when the Spirit a ſuppoted to give them utterance, at other times they are ſilent at their meetings; and as to the Methodiſts, they pretend to profeſs purer doctrines than thoſe of the church of England; but they are all Proteſtants not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, and deny the authority of the Pope and of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The King can alſo make war and peace, without the conſent of his Parliament; but though he can declare war, he cannot carry it on without money, and this money he cannot get without the people's conſent; this therefore obliges him never to make war but with the approbation of Parliament. He has the appointment of Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to foreign Courts, who repreſent the King that ſends them, and protect their countrymen when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion requires it.</p>

                     <p>The Sheriff of the county then is the firſt. His office is that of Chief Gaoler and he has the cuſtody of all criminals and delinquents in the diſtrict within his command. Though I call him Chief Goaler, he is, by virtue of his office for the time being, the firſt man in the county, and ranks before every nobleman therein. There is one preſiding over every county, and is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the King, out of the gentlemen reſident in that county. The county priſon, and the keeper of that priſon are under his controul, and it is his duty to execute the ſentence of the law upon all criminals, himſelf, or to find one to do it for him, though that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence extend even to death. Moſt gentlemen aſpire to the office of Sheriff, though it is attended with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of 5 or 600 pounds for the year they ſerve. There are two Sheriffs for the City of London, choſen by the City.</p>
                     <p>The next officer to the Sheriff is the Coroner. Every county has more than one. Some have four, ſome ſix, according to the extend of the county. He is choſen by the freeholders, and his office is for life, though he may be removed for miſconduct. His duty is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the death of ſuch as are killed, die ſuddenly, or in priſon; he has fees upon the occaſion, ſo that his place is a place of emolument.</p>
                     <p>The next order of ſubordinate Magiſtrates, are Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of the Peace, the chief of whom is the <hi>Cuſtos Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulorum,</hi> or the keeper of the county records.</p>

                     <p>He acts under the King in a military ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.

                     <p>Of great uſe. Precedence in rank is more attended to by great people then you are aware of. Precedence generally takes place in the following order. Princes, Archbiſhops, Dukes, Marquiſſes, Earls, Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, Biſhops, Barons, Knights of the Garter, Privy Counſellors, Judges, Baronets, Knights of the Bath, Knights, Doctors, Eſquires, and Gentlemen. The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility are very particular to preſerve their rank on all public occaſions: and you will find a title reſpected every where. Beſides, if there are any offices of profit in government, the church, the army, or the navy, the nobility can procure them for themſelves or their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in preference to other people; and all the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about the King are commonly filled with them. And add to this, they have a number of privileges. A Peer, like a Member in the Houſe of Commons, cannot be arreſted and thrown into priſon for debt; they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ll their poſt letters free of expence, and can frank or free the letters of others. A peer, if guilty of a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal act, is tried always by the Houſe of Lords, and can command an audience of the King at any time, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0464101900:207"/>refuſed admittance: and they, as well as Clergymen, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the benefit of clergy, are not burnt in the hand.</p>

                     <p>What is called <hi>Benefit of Clergy,</hi> had its riſe in the pious reverence of chriſtian princes for the church in its infant ſtate, being an inſtitution to exempt the Clergy from being criminally proceeded againſt by ſecular or lay judges. Popiſh excleſiaſtics ſoon made an ill uſe of this, for they afterwards claimed this indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, not only for themſelves, but for all attendants upon the church, whether they were Clergymen or not; and in length of time, this exemption grew gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and all who could read had the ſame indulgence, reading being a great mark of learning in thoſe days of ignorance, till an act of Parliament of Henry VII. made a diſtinction between Lay-men and Clergymen, ſubjecting the former for certain crimes deſerving death, to be burnt with a hot iron on the left thumb, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them this privilege a ſecond time, and they are now not even required to read, but the indulgence is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally granted to all perſons both men and women. Clergymen, however, if found guilty of ſuch offences as claim this benefit of clergy are not burnt in the hand, but immediately diſcharged, and this as often as they offend; whereas others ſuffer death for the ſecond of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: and as to Peers when found guilty, they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged without burning in the hand, but if condemned for the ſame offence of ſecond time, will, like other lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſuffer death.</p>

                     <p>Many Gentlemen from their extenſive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty can command the votes of freeholders, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of towns, which ſend members to parliament, of courſe, they can appoint ſuch members, and theſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers will naturally give their vote as the perſon ſhall direct, to whom they owe their ſeat in the Houſe of Commons.

                     <p>Yes, but the next are of lower order; I think the next is the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> of which there are two degrees, High and Petty: High Conſtables are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Bench of Juſtices at the Quarterly Seſſions of the Peace, which are held quarterly at the principal town in the county, for the adminiſtration of juſtice in matters of ſmall concern. They preſide over a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict called a hundred, conſiſting of ſeveral pariſhes. Petty Conſtables are inferior officers in every town and pariſh, ſelected by the High Conſtables from the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioners, and are ſubordinate to the High Conſtables. They are appointed by two Juſtices to ſerve one year: the duty of a Conſtable is to keep good order in the pariſh, and for this purpoſe he can take up diſorderly perſons, confine them and carry them before a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. This office is not held very reputable; and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently thoſe that are appointed, for all muſt ſerve in their turn, will pay a fine or ſum of money to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed ſerving; in this caſe another takes the office.</p>

Their duty is to raiſe money in the pariſh, by collecting from every one, in proportion to the rent of the houſe lives in, for the relief of their own Poor, who are not able to work, and to provide work for ſuch as <hi>are</hi> able, and cannot get employ.</p>

                     <p>I am; the people are divided into two claſſes. The Clergy and the Laity. The Clergy being an order of men ſet apart to attend the ſervice of God, have certain privileges allowed them. Among the reſt, one is, not to be liable to ſerve temporal ofices, as Sheriff, Conſtable, Overſeer, and the like; but then they have certain diſabilities on account of their ſpiritual avocations; they are incapable of ſitting in the Houſe of Commons, nor can any Rector or Vicar take any lands to farm, or follow any way of buſineſs.</p>

                     <p>England is divided into two provinces, over each of which preſides an Archbiſhop. Three of the Biſhopricks, Durham, Cheſter and Carliſle, are ſubject to the Biſhop of York, and the other twenty-one to the Archbiſhop of Canterbury. An Archbiſhop is the head of the Clergy in his whole province, and governs the Biſhops as well as the inferior Clergy. At the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the King, he calls the Biſhops and Clergy of his province to meet in convocation. All the Biſhops have ſome livings more or leſs to give away among the Clergy, and when a Clergyman of any pariſh dies, of which the Church is in the gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>They meet as often as the Parliament does, but meet only to diſperſe again, for they have no ſooner choſen their Prolocutor or Chairman than the King prorogues them or prevents their continuance. They formerly ſettled the buſineſs of the church, but being found to enter into matters that did not concern them, the King has never ſuffered them to do any buſineſs ſince the year 1716.

                     <p>A Biſhop, as well as an Archbiſhop, beſides the power of ordaining Clergymen and other holy ordinances, has authority to inſpect the manners of the Laity as well as of the Clergy, and puniſh delinquents by eccleſiaſtical cenſures; to this end, they hold courts of Civil Law.</p>

                     <p>Tithes are the tenth part of the produce of the lands lying in each pariſh, which time out of mind have been the property of the Rector or Parſon of the pariſh, but for the maintenance of the Biſhops, ſeveral of theſe Rectories have been converted into Vicarages, that is, the tithes have been divided, and the great tithes, as corn, hay, and ſuch things as are moſt valuable, have been appropriated to the uſe of the Biſhops, and the ſmaller tithes, as milk, fruit, &amp;c. have been ſettled on the Clergymen who ſerved the Church, and whom the Biſhop appoints; ſuch Clergymen are called <hi>Vicars.</hi> Whereas ſuch as have all the tithes of a pariſh, both

                     <p>Before either Rectors or Vicars, I ſhould have mentioned a Dean and Chapter. The Dean, with the Chapter of the Cathedral Church, (that is the Canons or Prebendaries, which are Clergymen that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſervice of the Cathedral) are the Biſhop's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to aſſiſt him with advice in matters of religion, or the temporal concerns of his biſhoprick; moſt of the Deans are appointed by the King, and ſome few by the Biſhop of the dioceſe. It is the ſame with the Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries; ſome of whom are nominated by the King, and others by the Biſhops.</p>
                     <p>The next perſon to be mentioned is the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con. This is alſo a clerical officer, is ſubordinate to the Biſhop of the dioceſe, and is appointed by the Biſhop, but has a kind of epiſcopal authority independent of him. It is the province and duty of a Biſhop to hold a viſitation in the ſeveral parts of his dioceſe, that is to go round his biſhoprick once in three years, to confirm the children, inſpect the manners of the Clergy, ſo that the churches are kept in order, and that every reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious inſtruction is properly attended.

                     <p>The Archbiſhoprick of Canterbury is 10,000 pounds a-year, that of York 8000 pounds; and the ſeveral Biſhops, including livings they ſometimes hold, have from 7000 pounds to 2000 pounds. Deaneries are from about 1500 pounds a-year to about 200 pounds, and Prebends from about 700 pounds a-year to 50 pounds. So much then for the Clergy. I have now only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the inferior offices of the church, <hi>viz.</hi> Church-Wardens, Pariſh Clerks, and Sextons.</p>
                     <p>There are generally two Church-wardens choſen for every pariſh, one by the inhabitants, and one by the Rector or Vicar; theſe are the Guardians of the church, and the repreſentatives of the body of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners. Their duty is to keep the church in repair, and collect money from the pariſhioners in proper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions for that purpoſe, and they with the Overſeers have alſo the management of the poor.</p>
                     <p>Pariſh Clerks are generally appointed by the Rector or Vicar, and are ſworn into their office by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon; their duty is to attend the Miniſter in the offices of the church.</p>

                     <p>Sextons are perſons that toll the bell, dig the graves, and keep the churches clean and quite during divine ſervice.</p>

                     <p>Manors are as ancient as the Saxon Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which was general in this country before the year 1066, when it was conquered by King William I.

This was the ſtate of the <hi>ſcodal</hi> ſyſtem ſo much ſpoken of in hiſtory; men were then at the will of their Lord.

Great part of theſe Manors, as now, conſiſted of waſte ground, and as Chriſtianity ſpread, the Lords of theſe Manors began to build Churches on their waſtes, for the accommodation of their tenants, and obliged thoſe tenants to appropriate their tithes to the ſupport of one officiating Miniſter, which before, were diſtributed among all the Clergy in the dioceſe; and this tract or extent of land, the tithes of which were ſo appropriated was called a pariſh: and becauſe they built the Church, they were allowed to nominate a Miniſter, ſubject to his examination by the Biſhop. This right of nomination is called an <hi>advowſon,</hi> and is ſaleable like an eſtate, provided the Rector or Vicar is firſt appointed.</p>

                     <p>It is with difficulty. Indeed the officers ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom do, they have generally ſmall fortunes of their own. The army is a profeſſion of honour rather than of profit, and ſo great is the eagerneſs of young men to get into it, that commiſſions are oftener purchaſed than given away. 350 pounds is the price given for an Enſigncy, and the pay is not more than about fifty pounds a year. In time of peace when regiments are quartered or ſettled in a country place, an Enſign can make ſhift to live upon his pay, the inns upon the roads are obliged to give him a bed and three good meals a day for one ſhilling, in which caſe he has two ſhillings and ſix-pence left for cloaths and other things: and as to the common Soldiers, the public houſes are obliged by act of parliament to give them a lodging, ſmall beer, fire, and utenſils to dreſs their food, with ſalt, pepper, and vinegar for nothing, or to find them in victuals for four-pence a day.</p>

                     <p>Becauſe they enter very early into it, and are brought up with high notions of honour, bravery and politeneſs to each other. There is ſuch a diſcipline in the army that no officer dare contradict, diſpute, or diſobey the orders of a ſuperior officer, tho' that officer ſhall perhaps be only an older Captain, or an older En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, on pain of being tried by his brother officers for diſobedience of orders, and of being puniſhed, broke, and diſgraced, if found guilty: a lad that is undutiful to his parents or maſters, will be there ſoon taught ſubordination and obedience; he will learn to live upon ſix-pence a day, to bear heat and cold and fatigue, and never to commit a diſhonourable action.</p>

                     <p>The firſt then is the court of Common Pleas, calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to redreſs injuries, committed by one man upon the property of another, in any part of the: kingdom.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0464101900:229"/>It was eſtabliſhed in Weſtminſter Hall by King John, in 1216, where it has continued ever ſince. The Judges of this Court are four in number; the Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas, and three <hi>puiſne,</hi> or Under Judges, who ſit every day in Term time, to hear and determine all matters of law, ariſing in civil cauſes, real or perſonal.</p>

                     <p>By civil cauſes are meant all infringements upon property, carried on or proſecuted by the perſon injured, in contradiſtinction to criminal cauſes, which are conſidered as breaches of the peace, and though commenced by the party aggrieved, are carried on in the King's name, as the chief magiſtrate and enforcer of the Laws.</p>
                     <p>The Court of King's Bench is the next (ſo called, becauſe the King uſed to ſit there in perſon) and is the Supreme Court of Common Law, in the kingdom. It has alſo four Judges, a Chief Juſtice, and three <hi>puiſne</hi> ones.</p>

                     <p>There is another principal Court of Law, called the Court of Exchequer, which is a Court of Equity too and was eſtabliſhed originally to recover debts due to the King: people may, however, apply to this Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>But the fourth and laſt, is the High Court of Chancery, the moſt important of all in matters of civil property. Here the Lord Chancellor ſits as Judge, and determines the matter by his own decree; whereas, in the Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas, the matter is heard and determined by a Jury of twelve men. But if a man thinks himſelf aggrieved, even by a decree of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, in the Court of Chancery, he may refer his cauſe to the deciſion of the Houſe of Lords, where it may be re-heard.</p>

Their buſineſs is to try by a Jury of the reſpective counties ſuch cauſes as muſt otherwiſe be brought up to Weſtminſter. Thus for the caſe of the ſubject, juſtice is brought home to every man's door; diſputed facts are tried, if required, in the country, by neighbours; and criminals are proſecuted, where the witneſſes are near at hand to attend.</p>

                     <p>Of Counſel there are two degrees, Barriſters and Serjeants. Barriſters, after they have been admitted five years, in any of the Inns of Court, ſuch as the Temple, Lincoln's Inn, &amp;c. that is, after five year ſtanding, are called to the bar: and after ſixteen years ſtanding, they may be called to the degree of Serjeants. The Judges are always admitted Serjeants, before they are made Judges. Out of theſe Barriſters of Serjeants, the King's Counſel are uſually ſelected, the two principal of whom are called his Attorney and Sollicitor-General, who are always Members of Parliament.</p>

From common Barriſters, they are promoted to be King's Counſel, and from King's Counſel, generally to be Maſters in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery and Judges. Such of the Counſel, as are appointed to be Solicitor and Attorney-General to the King, generally come to be Chief Juſtices or Lord Chancellor. The Solicitor-General is commonly promoted to the office of Attorney General, and thence to be either Chief Juſtice or Lord Chancellor, which ſeldom fails to procure him a peerage. For the Lord Chancellor does not uſually continue long in office.</p>

                     <p>The ſiege of Troy, though founded on fact, is ſo enveloped in fable, that the whole has, by ſome, been conſidered as fabulous. It is made the ſubject of an Heroic Poem, written in Greek, by Homer, the firſt of Poets, who lived nine hundred years before the birth of Chriſt. To give you a complete account of it, you ſhould firſt be acquainted with the Heathen Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, or the fabulous Deities of Antiquity. However, I will give you the beſt notion of it I can.</p>
                     <p>The City of Troy was ſituated in that part of Phrygia, adjoining the Boſphorus of Thrace, which is now called the Straits of Conſtantinople, and flouriſhed about one thouſand two hundred years before Chriſt. We are told that Hecuba, the wife of Priam, King of Troy, when with child of Paris, dreamed that ſhe was brought to bed of a flaming torch, which, being conſtrued by an Oracle, who was ſuppoſed to have the gift of prophecy, to imply that the child of which ſhe was big, would, one day, be the ruin of his country and his family; her huſband Priam, ordered him, when born, to be put to death; but Hecuba ſecreted him, and had him brought up by a ſhepherd. Many years afterwards, Paris who
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0464101900:235"/>was unacquainted with his birth, came to Troy, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for a prize, which the king propoſed to give among his young nobility, and won it. Hector, the eldeſt ſon of Priam, enquiring about this young man, ſoon found him to be his brother. King Priam received him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him, and gave him that rank that was his due. Some time after, Paris having been at Sparta to recover his aunt Heſione whom Hercules had run away with, took away be force Helena the wife of Menelaus, king of that city, and ſwore he would never return her till his aunt Heſione was returned. The Grecian princes round about, took part with Menelaus, and engaged themſelves by oath never to lay down their arms, till they had overthrown the city of Troy.</p>
                     <p>The Grecian army was conducted by 95 leaders, kings, princes, or heroes much celebrated at that time for ſingular atchievements. And Agamemnon, king of Argos and Mycene, was declared commander in chief. Among the Grecian leaders were Neſtor, Achilles, and Patroclus his friend, Ajax, ſon of Telamon, the other Ajax, Idomeneus, Diomedes, Ulyſſes and Palimedos. Their fleet was compoſed of 2190 veſſels.</p>
                     <p>The ſuperb city of Troy was defended by the all the princes of Aſia, and who to equal the forces of Greece, aſſembled a very powerful army. They were commanded alſo by very valiant princes, and by all the ſons of Priam (which were 50 in number) the eldeſt of which was Hector, who alone could have ſuſtained and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed all the efforts of the enemy, had fate not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined it to the contrary. The Trojans were every where conquerors under this hero; they drove the Greeks from every part, and burnt their fleet, ſo that they repented of their expedition; for Achilles was offended with Agamemnon, and had with-drawn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which changed the face of things. In this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſcomfiture, Patroclus the friend of Achilles, anxious to recal their good fortune, took the arms of Achilles, and put himſelf at the head of the Grecian army, repulſed the Trojans and challenged Hector to ſingle combat. Hector advanced, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troclus fell a ſacrifice to his ſword. Achilles then, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0464101900:236"/>at the death of his friend, forgot the offence of Agamemnon, attacked the Trojan hero, killed him, tied him to his chariot wheels, and dragged him round the walls of Troy and the grave of his friend Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus.</p>
                     <p>The death of Hector was as great a loſs to the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans, as the retreat of Achilles had been to the Greeks. Priam demanded a truce or ceſſation of arms for ſome days, during which time he went with part of his family and ſome rich preſents, to requeſt of Achilles the dead body of his ſon, that he might beſtow upon him the laſt honours. Achilles, moved with the tears of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixena, Hector's ſiſter, whoſe beauty had ſmitten him, yielded to Priam's requeſt. Paris, profited by this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, and revenged his brothers death; he promiſed Achilles to give him his ſiſter in marriage, and kept his word, and they were ſcarce aſſembled in the temple to ſolemnize the marriage, than Paris took an opportunity to murder Achilles.</p>
                     <p>Enraged at this, Pyrrhus, the ſon of Achilles, came with a conſiderable re-enforcement, and joined the Greeks to revenge the death of his father. But the oracle having declared, that Troy never would be taken whilſt it poſſeſſed the <hi>Palladium,</hi> (which was a ſtatue of Pallas the goddeſs of war, ſuperſtitiouſly ſuppoſed to have deſcended from heaven and to have placed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the altar) Diomedes and Ulyſſes took upon them to take it away, which they did with great clever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>The Greeks however not being able to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves maſters of the city by force, undertook to ſurpriſe it. They pretended that Minerva had puniſhed them for taking her from the Palladium, and after ten years ſiege, in which it had coſt them the lives of ſo many great and illuſtrious men, they had recourſe to this ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem. They conſtructed a wooden horſe, in the belly of which they ſhut up a great number of armed ſoldiers, and concealed it in the iſland of Tenedos: they gave but that they built this horſe as an atonement for the injury they had done Minerva. The Trojans, on the Greeks leaving it, crowded round the figure, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0464101900:237"/>by a vain hope, which was heightened by one Sinon, whom the Greeks inſtructed to ſay, that if that horſe was conveyed within the walls of Troy, it would thence forth be impregnable; ſeduced, I ſay, by this ſtory, they inſtantly proceeded to make a breach in the walls, and introduced this fatal machine. This day, which was the laſt of Troy, became a day of merriment, in which each man gave way to the blind tranſports of folly. Night came on, and when the whole city was at reſt, wrapt up in fatal ſecurity, the Grecian ſoldiers opened the ſides of the horſe, and under cover of the night, ſpread themſelves in all quarters of the city, to which they ſet fire, and the flames was a ſignal to the enemy, who entered by the breach, and put all to the ſword. The Trojans made a deſperate defence, and did not yield till they were overpowered by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Pyrrhus in particular committed unheard-of cruelties. He broke into Priam's palace and ſlew the prince and all his family at the foot of the altar where they had fled for refuge. Polixenes was conſidered as the cauſe of Achilles's death: her, Pyrrhus ſacrificed upon the <hi>tumulus</hi> or tomb which the Greeks had raiſed to his memory; Andromache, Hector's wife, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed her ſon Aſlyanax in the tomb of that hero; Ulyſſes found him out, and threw him down from the top of a high tower; Pyrrhus took Andromache to Epirus afterwards and married her.</p>
                     <p>Such was the ſad fate of the proud city of Troy, which took place in the year 1180 before, Chriſt. She ſaw periſh before he walls 886,000 Greeks, and within her boſom 670,000 of her own citizens.</p>

                     <p>Magna Charta is the great charter of liberty which the barons, that is, the nobility of this country, being at war with King John, compelled him to ſign, in the year 1215. Under all deſpotic governments, the king not only makes free with the purſes of his ſubjects, but alſo with their perſons; that is, will not only take away their property when he has occaſion for it, but will impriſon them at his pleaſure. By ſigning this charter, king John renounced for ever, in the name of the kings of this country, all ſuch arbitrary meaſures, and acquieſced to ſuch terms as to this day have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the liberties of the ſubject. The Habeas Corpus bill, and act paſſed in the reign of king Charles II. is one of the glorious conſequences of this great charter.</p>

                     <p>By virtue of this act of parliament, no man can be impriſoned without knowing the cauſe of ſuch impriſonment, and having his caſe fairly argued in a court of juſtice.

If when his caſe is argued, he be acquitted, he cannot be impriſoned again for the ſame offence.</p>
