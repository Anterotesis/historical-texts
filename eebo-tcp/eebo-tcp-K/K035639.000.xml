            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

WILLIAM COWPER, ESQ.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THERE is, I hope, ſome propriety in my addreſſing a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to you, which would never perhaps have exiſted, had
I not, amid the heavy preſſure of many ſorrows, derived
infinite conſolation from your Poetry, and ſome degree of
animation and of confidence from your eſteem.</p>
            <p>The following performance is far from aſpiring to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
as an imitation of your inimitable Poem, "<hi>THE
TASK</hi>;" I am perfectly ſenſible, that it belongs not to a
feeble and feminine hand to draw the Bow of Ulyſſes.</p>
            <p>The force, clearneſs, and ſublimity of your admirable Poem;
the felicity, almoſt peculiar to your genius, of giving to the
moſt familiar objects dignity and effect, I could never hope to
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1240901700:4"/>
reach; yet, having read "The Taſk" almoſt inceſſantly from
its firſt publication to the preſent time, I felt that kind of
enchantment deſcribed by Milton, when he ſays,
<q>
                  <l>The Angel ended, and in Adam's ear</l>
                  <l>So charming left his voice, that he awhile</l>
                  <l>Thought him ſtill ſpeaking.—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And from the force of this impreſſion, I was gradually led to
attempt, in Blank Verſe, a delineation of thoſe intereſting ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
which happened to excite my attention, and which even
preſſed upon an heart, that has learned, perhaps from its own
ſufferings, to feel with acute, though unavailing compaſſion,
the calamity of others.</p>
            <p>A Dedication uſually conſiſts of praiſes and of apologies;
<hi>my</hi> praiſe can add nothing to the unanimous and loud applauſe
of your country. She regards you with pride, as one of the
few, who, at the preſent period, reſcue her from the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of having degenerated in Poetical talents; but in the
form of Apology, I ſhould have much to ſay, if I again dared
to plead the preſſure of evils, aggravated by their long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
as an excuſe for the defects of this attempt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1240901700:5"/>
Whatever may be the faults of its execution, let me vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
myſelf from thoſe, that may be imputed to the deſign.—
In ſpeaking of the Emigrant Clergy, I beg to be underſtood as
feeling the utmoſt reſpect for the integrity of their principles;
and it is with pleaſure I add my ſuffrage to that of thoſe,
who have had a ſimilar opportunity of witneſſing the conduct
of the Emigrants of all deſcriptions during their exile in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
which has been ſuch as does honour to <hi>their</hi> nation,
and ought to ſecure to them in ours the eſteem of every liberal
mind.</p>
            <p>Your philanthropy, dear Sir, will induce you, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded,
to join with me in hoping, that this painful exile may
finally lead to the extirpation of that reciprocal hatred ſo
unworthy of great and enlightened nations; that it may tend
to humanize both countries, by convincing each, that good
qualities exiſt in the other; and at length annihilate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
that have ſo long exiſted to the injury of both.</p>
            <p>Yet it is unfortunately but too true, that with the body of
the Engliſh, this national averſion has acquired new force by
the dreadful ſcenes which have been acted in France during
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:1240901700:6"/>
the laſt ſummer—even thoſe who are the victims of the
Revolution, have not eſcaped the odium, which the undiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
multitude annex to all the natives of a country where
ſuch horrors have been acted: nor is this the worſt effect thoſe
events have had on the minds of the Engliſh; by confounding
the original cauſe with the wretched cataſtrophes that have
followed its ill management; the attempts of public virtue,
with the outrages that guilt and folly have committed in its
diſguiſe, the very name of Liberty has not only loſt the charm
it uſed to have in Britiſh ears, but many, who have written,
or ſpoken, in its defence, have been ſtigmatized as promoters
of Anarchy, and enemies to the proſperity of their country.
Perhaps even the Author of "The Taſk," with all his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and tenderneſs of heart, is in the catalogue of thoſe,
who are reckoned to have been too warm in a cauſe, which
it was once the glory of Engliſhmen to avow and defend—
The exquiſite Poem, indeed, in which you have honoured
Liberty, by a tribute highly gratifying to her ſincereſt
friends, was publiſhed ſome years before the demolition of
regal deſpotiſin in France, which, in the fifth book, it ſeems
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:1240901700:7"/>
to foretell—All the truth and energy of the paſſage to which
I allude, muſt have been ſtrongly felt, when, in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of England, the greateſt Orator of our time quoted the
ſublimeſt of our Poets—when the eloquence of Fox did juſtice
to the genius of Cowper.</p>
