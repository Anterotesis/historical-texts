            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Honour YOUR ROYAL HIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS has done me in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection you was pleaſed to give to this Tragedy, emboldens me to lay it now at your Feet, and beg your Permiſſion to publiſh it under your Royal Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. The Favouring and Protecting of Letters has been, in all Ages and Countries, one diſtinguiſhing Mark of a great Prince; and That with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not only as it ſhews a Juſtneſs of Taſte, and Elevation of Mind, but as
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1193001300:4"/>
the Influence of ſuch a Protection, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing good Writers to labour with more Emulation in the Improvement of their ſeveral Talents, not a little contributes to the Embelliſhment, and Inſtruction of Society. But of all the different Species of Writing, none has ſuch an Effect upon the Lives and Manners of Men, as the Dramatick; and therefore That of all others moſt deſerves the Attention of Princes, who by a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Approbation of ſuch Pieces as tend to promote all Publick and Private Virtue, may more than by any coercive Methods ſecure the Purity of the Stage, and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof greatly advance the Morals and Politeneſs of their People. How eminently YOUR ROYAL HIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS has always extended your Favour and Patronage to every Art and Science, and in a particular Manner to Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Performances, is too well known to the World for me to mention it here. Allow me only to wiſh, that what I have now the Honour to offer your
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:1193001300:5"/>
ROYAL HIGHNESS may be judged not unworthy of your Protection, at leaſt in the <hi>Sentiments</hi> which it inculcates. A warm and grateful Senſe of your Goodneſs to me makes me deſirous to ſeize every Occaſion of declaring in Publick, with what profound Reſpect and dutiful Attachment, I am,</p>

                     <l>That by rude Force the Paſſions would command,</l>
                     <l>That ruthleſs ſought to root them from the Breaſt;</l>
                     <l>They may be rul'd, but will not be oppreſt.</l>
                     <l>Taught hence, Ye Parents, who from Nature ſtray,</l>
                     <l>And the great Ties of ſocial Life betray;</l>
                     <l>Ne'er with your Children act a Tyrant's Part:</l>
                     <l>'Tis your's to guide, not violate the Heart.</l>
                     <l>Ye vainly wiſe, who o'er Mankind preſide,</l>
                     <l>Behold my righteous Woes, and drop your Pride!</l>
                     <l>Keep Virtue's ſimple Path before your Eyes,</l>
                     <l>Nor think from Evil Good can ever riſe.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>CRamm'd to the Throat with wholeſome moral Stuff,</l>
               <l>Alas! poor Audience! you have had enough.</l>
               <l>Was ever hapleſs Heroine of a Play</l>
               <l>In ſuch a piteous Plight as ours To-day?</l>
               <l>Was ever Woman ſo by Love betray'd?</l>
               <l>Match'd with two Huſbands, and yet—die a Maid.</l>
               <l>But bleſs me!—hold—What Sounds are theſe I hear!—</l>
               <l>I ſee the <hi>TRAGIC MUSE</hi> herſelf appear.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The Back-Scene opens, and diſcovers a romantic Silvan Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkip; from which Mrs. CIBBER, in the Character of the TRAGIC MUSE, advances ſlowly to Muſick, and ſpeaks the following Lines.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Hence with your flippant Epilogue, that tries</l>
               <l>To wipe the virtuous Tear from <hi>BRITISH</hi> Eyes;</l>
               <l>That dares my moral Tragic Scene profane,</l>
               <l>With Strains—at beſt, unſuiting, light and vain.</l>
               <l>Hence from the pure unſully'd Beams that play</l>
               <l>In yon fair Eyes, where Virtue ſhines—Away!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>BRITONS,</hi> to you from chaſte <hi>Caſtalian</hi> Groves,</l>
               <l>Where dwell the tender, oft unhappy Loves;</l>
               <l>Where Shades of Heroes roam, each mighty Name,</l>
               <l>And court my Aid to riſe again to Fame;</l>
               <l>To you I come, to Freedom's nobleſt Seat,</l>
               <l>And in <hi>BRITANNIA</hi> fix my laſt Retreat.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In <hi>GREECE,</hi> and <hi>ROME,</hi> I watch'd the Publick Weal;</l>
               <l>The purple Tyrant trembled at my Steel:</l>
               <l>Nor did I leſs o'er private Sorrows reign,</l>
               <l>And mend the melting Heart with ſofter Pain.</l>
               <l>On <hi>FRANCE</hi> and <hi>YOU</hi> then roſe my brightning Star,</l>
               <l>With ſocial Ray—The <hi>ARTS</hi> are ne'er at War.</l>
               <l>O as your Fire and Genius ſtronger blaze,</l>
               <l>As yours are generous Freedom's bolder Lays,</l>
               <l>Let not the <hi>Gallick</hi> Taſte leave yours behind,</l>
               <l>In decent Manners and in Life refin'd;</l>
               <l>Baniſh the motley Mode, to tag low Verſe,</l>
               <l>The laughing Ballad to the mournful Herſe.</l>
               <l>When thro' five Acts your Hearts have learnt to glow,</l>
               <l>Touch'd with the ſacred Force of honeſt Woe;</l>
               <l>O keep the dear Impreſſion on your Breaſt,</l>
               <l>Nor idly loſe it for a wretched Jeſt!</l>
