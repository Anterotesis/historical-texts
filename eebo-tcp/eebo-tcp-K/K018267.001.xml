            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>WE have taken the earlieſt opportunity that a judicious inſpection, and mature conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of events could give us, of preſenting to the public, A COMPLEAT HISTORY OF THE LATE WAR, not leſs important than, we hope, uſeful and correct, written with an impartiality which ſhould be the guide of every hiſtorian, and from which we have not deviated through national affection.</p>
                  <p>WE have taken up our HISTORY from the commencement of the war, and have beſtowed all the pains upon it, ſo intereſting a ſubject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, which, however, we muſt acknowledge, deſerves much more ſkilful workmen. None was ever more formed to excite curioſity, from the importance of events, the dignity of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons engaged, the greatneſs of the actions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and the amazing revolutions of fortune; for the Reader will here find the ſcattered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of this war, which has been carried on in the four quarters of the world, united in one connected narrative, and continued to the peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:1261701201:4"/>To effect this from the materials that offered, has been a work of more labour, than may at firſt appear, and to render theſe tranſactions (which have not been leſs our amazement, than the world's in general) the more conſpicuous and clear, we have added, in Notes, the accounts tranſmitted from the commanders of our fleets and armies, and publiſhed by authority, when facts were recent, and the immediate object of univerſal attention. Theſe will illuſtrate and confirm the Hiſtory; and our readers muſt be pleaſed to ſee ſo many curious and important pieces, which while they give the cleareſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſupport the national character to future ages. In many places we find them filled with the actions of inferior officers, which, with leſs care in their ſuperiors, would have been loſt in the multiplicity of events: This care, not leſs commendable than uſeful, will excite officers to ſeize every opportunity of immortalizing their fame, and doing honour to their reſpective corps. Some of theſe letters muſt be uſeful in forming the young ſoldier, as they are very expreſſive of that character, pointing out the care, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, anxiety, and perſeverance to form a WOLFE, or a GRANBY.</p>

                           <p>Origin of the troubles in North America. Admiral Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cawen and General Braddock ſent thither. Operations intended. Two French men of war taken. Braddock defeated. Gen. Johnſon repulſes the French. French threaten an invaſion. Fort St. Philip beſieged and taken. Treaty with Ruſſia, the ſpirit of it. Alliance with the King of Pruſſia.

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE original plan of this work propoſed no more than, that each volume ſhould contain a narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of thoſe events which diſtinguiſh its own Year. But, becauſe we have entered upon our undertaking in the heat of an almoſt general and very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant war, I thought it would not be unneceſſary or diſagreeable to look a little farther back. It would be difficult, perfectly to underſtand the operations of the ſeveral powers at war, without reviewing the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions of the preceding years; nor would it be eaſy
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1261701201:18"/>
to enter into the ſpirit of theſe, without examining the cauſes which more nearly or remotely operated to produce thoſe troubles that have involved ſo many parts of the world in one common diſtraction.</p>
                        <p>The war in which all parties and intereſts ſeem now to be ſo perfectly blended, aroſe from cauſes which originally had not the leaſt connection: the uncertain limits of the Engliſh and French territories in America; and the mutual claims of the Houſes of Auſtria and Brandenbourg on the dutchy of Sileſia. It is no wonder that the two former powers ſeizing on a country in which they conſidered the right of the natural Inhabitants as nothing, ſhould find it a very difficult matter to ſettle their own. For a long time neither of theſe powers were ſufficiently acquainted with the geography of America, to enable them to aſcertain the limits of their ſeveral pretenſions with any tolerable exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; nor, indeed, were theſe matters deemed of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent moment to call for a very laborious diſcuſſion. At the treaty of Utrecht, whilſt ſo many more important Intereſts, or what then ſeemed more important, were diſcuſſed, the limits of Nova Scotia, then called Acadia, were expreſſed only in general terms, and left to be put on a more certain footing by ſubſequent negotiations. Theſe negotiations purſued with no vigour, and drawn out into an exceſſive length, ſeemed only to increaſe the former confuſion. After the acceſſion of the preſent Royal Family, a French connection, perhaps neceſſary from the circumſtances of the time, and afterwards a certain negligence of all affairs but thoſe of our domeſtic polity, ſuffered this important point to vaniſh almoſt wholly out of our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. During this interval, our colonies on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of North Amerca, extended themſelves on every ſide. Whilſt agriculture and the maritime commerce flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed on their coaſts, the Indian trade drew ſeveral of our wandering dealers far into the inland country, and beyond the great mountains. Here they found themſelves in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful climate, in a ſoil abundantly fruitful, and watered with many fair and navigable rivers. Theſe advantages, joined to thoſe of the Indian trade, appeared to compenſate for its remoteneſs from the ſea. It was judged, that as the firſt ſettlers on the coaſt, we had a good right to the inland country; and, if ſo, to the navigation of the Miſſiſippi, which opened another door to the ocean. With theſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1261701201:19"/>
views, a company of merchants and planters, obtained a charter for a conſiderable tract of land near the river Ohio, on the weſtern ſide of the Alleganey mountains, but within the province of Virginia; and the adventurers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſettle purſuant to the terms of their patent.</p>
                        <p>Now began to ſhoot forth the ſeeds of another diſpute, which had long lain unobſerved, but which proved alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as thorny and intricate as that concerning the limits of Acadia. The French pretending to have firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the mouths of the Miſſiſippi, claimed the whole adjacent country, towards New Mexico on the eaſt, quite to the Apalachian or Alleganey mountains on the weſt. They drove off the new ſettlers, and built a new fort called du Queſne, on the forks of the River Monongahela, a ſituation which commanded the entrance into all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try on the Ohio and Miſſiſippi.</p>
                        <p>The reader will obſerve, that I do not pretend to decide concerning the right of either nation in this conteſt. It is evident enough, that the conſideration of the right had much leſs influence on both parties, than the conſideration of conveniency. Should the French be able to unite Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada to their colonies at the mouth of the Miſſiſippi by a poſſeſſion of all that vaſt country which lies between them, the Engliſh colonies muſt loſe all ſhare in the Indian trade in time of peace; and in time of war be expoſed to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual dangers, or to the ruinouſly chargeable defence of a frontier more than 1500 miles in length. If on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the French ſhould fail to make good theſe claims on the Ohio, and thoſe on Nova Scotia, their two colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies entirely diſunited, and the entrance into one ſhut up for the winter ſeaſon by froſt, and the entrance into the other difficult in all ſeaſons by the banks at the mouth of the Miſſiſppi, muſt certainly loſe all their value to France, and in their fall involve much of the fortune of their great ſettlements in the Weſt Indies.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1755."/> Both nations being fully perſuaded of this, no longer looked on the affair of the Ohio as a matter of indifference. They prepared to cut the gordian knot of the long and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate negotiation by the ſword. Ships were fitted out, and ſome troops ſilently ſent off from Breſt. General Braddock ſailed to Virginia with about 1500 regular troops;



 24 men of war under the Admirals Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cawen and Moſtyn were ordered to America, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept the French ſupplies. Orders were ſent to our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1261701201:20"/>
colonies to arm; and three operations were actually under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, one againſt Fort du Queſne under Braddock; the other two againſt the French forts in Nova Scotia, and the fort of Crown Point on the Frontiers of New York. The two courts in the mean time breathed nothing but peace, and exchanged reciprocal profeſſions of friendſhip, and good will, which deceived neither party.</p>
                        <p>They who are of opinion that the paſſions and characters of the ruling men influence all public concerns as much as the public intereſts themſelves, thought they ſaw other cauſes operating to haſten this breach. On the death of a great Miniſter, which happened ſome time before, the adminiſtration was new moulded. Some perſons then taken in, were conſidered as belonging to a party not perfectly united with the remains of the old adminiſtration. It was thought, that the leading man of this party propoſed to work out the old Servants of the crown, in order to make way for a more uniform ſyſtem. As long as peace ſubſiſts, government is ſupported by itſelf; and any change is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult. But the conduct of a war, is a thing critical to a miniſtry. The leader of this party therefore, conſcious of his own talents, which all men acknowledged to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and of his connections which were conſiderable, warmly puſhed on a war, ſeconded by the fairneſs of the public motives, and the general voice of the people. In this war his friends relied, that things muſt neceſſarily be ſo embarraſſed, that the old party would find themſelves obliged to retire, and to leave the ſtage clear for them to ſerve their country according to their own plans, and on their own terms. This deſign was believed to be puſhed forward by another great man of that party, who had play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a game nearly of the ſame kind before, and in whom an advanced age had not abated any thing of his natural fire and love of violent councils.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 10."/> Things came to a criſis by the taking of two French men of war by the Admirals Boſcawen and Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn.

 

 The operations by land were carried on with vigour; but whether conducted with equal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſtand too near the time to decide. However, the French fort at Beauſejour was taken, and ſoon after thoſe on St. John's river were abandoned;

 

 by which we remained maſters of all Nova Scotia. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 16."/> The principal expedition was that againſt Fort du Queſne,

                           <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1261701201:22"/>
under General Braddock. That General abounding too much in his own ſenſe for the degree of military knowledge he poſſeſſed, commanding in a country which he did not know, and carrying on a ſpecies of war in which he had no experience, ſuffered himſelf, when he had advanced within 10 miles of Fort du Queſne, to be ſurpriſed by an ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade of French and Indians. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 9."/> His army was ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a panic from the unuſual appearance,

 

 and horried cries of the ſavages; they fled in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; they were totally defeated with a conſiderable ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, eſpecially of their officers. The General himſelf, after having five horſes killed under him, was mortally wounded; wiping away all the errors of his conduct by an honourable death for his country.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sep. 7."/> The nation was ſomething conſoled for this loſs in the ſignal advantage gained by General Johnſon, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the expedition deſigned againſt Crown Point.

 

 He was attacked in his intrenchments by the French General Dieſkau, but the aſſailants wanting cannon, and firing from too great a diſtance, were totally defeated, and Dieſkau himſelf was made priſoner. This victory, tho' very honourable for Mr. Johnſon and the provincial troops under his command, yet as it was gained late in the ſeaſon, and as the army was in no very good condition, it had no conſequences. On the whole, we ſeemed, after allowing for this victory, and for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodgment of the French from Nova Scotia, to have had the worſt part in the campaign; conſidering the ſanguine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations which had been formed, and the great ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſtrength which we exerted, or were able to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted, in that part of the world.</p>
                        <p>During this ſummer, our court took a reſolution not to wait the precarious operation of our arms in America for redreſs of the grievances complained of, but to ſtrike ſuch a blow as would at once put a ſecurity into our hands, for the evacuating the places the enemy had fortified in our territories, and diſable them in the two moſt material points, the reſources of their trade, and their ſeamen. Their merchant ſhips were every where attacked, as if war had been actually declared, and vaſt numbers brought into our ports. The French made all Europe reſound with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of what they called a proceeding ſo unjuſt, and a violation of the law of nations ſo flagrant and unprecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1261701201:23"/>
But, whether it was that they were really in no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to act, or that they intended to influence the other courts in their favour, by a ſhew of extraordinary modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they contented themſelves with this, and neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared war, nor made any ſort of repriſal for ſeveral months after. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1756."/> At lenght they began to act; ſeveral bodies of troops moved to the coaſts of Picardy,

 

 Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy and Britany; and all things threatened an invaſion on ſome part of this kingdom. Under the ſhadow of this ſtratagem, they got ready in the harbour of Toulon a fleet of twelve men of war of the line, with the utmoſt expedition, which convoyed an army of about 11,000 men,

 

 under command of the Duke de Richlieu to the iſland of Minorca. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="April 18."/> In a few days they opened the trenches before St. Philip's fort.

                        </p>
                        <p>This was done whilſt the nation trembled under a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful panic, too public to be concealed, too fatal in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences to be ever forgotten. The real invaſion did not leſſen our fears of the imaginary one; it threw us into a confuſion that ſuffered us to be ſenſible of nothing but our own weakneſs. We did not look upon ourſelves ſufficiently ſecured by the arrival of the Hanoverian and Heſſian troops, which the ſame weakneſs had induced us to call to our aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The miniſtry ſeemed to have been infected with the common terror; for though they had very early notice or the French deſigns, ſuch was the apprehenſion of the invaſion, or ſuch the ill-contrived diſpoſition of our navy, that Admiral Byng was not diſpatched to the Mediterranean before the 5th of April, and then with a ſquadron of no more than 10 ſhips of the line.</p>
                        <p>The engagement with the French fleet under M. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſoniere; the retreat of Byng by which the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of fort St. Philip was cut off from all hopes of relief;

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Feb. 14. 1757."/> From this melancholy picture, let us turn our eyes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and review the ſteps by which this war came to involve the reſt of the contending powers. The French, amongſt the other plans they formed for diſtreſſing our affairs, made no ſecret of their deſign of attacking his Majeſty's German dominions. Theſe countries evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently had no ſort of connexion with the matters which gave riſe to the war. But being under a Sovereign ſo remarkably affectionate to his native country; they judged he might be terrified into a relaxation of his rights in America, to preſerve Hanover from the calamities with which it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> threatened. Their politics, however, in this inſtance proved as unſucceſsful as they were unjuſt. No motion was made towards an abatement in our claims with regard to America; his Majeſty took other methods for the preſervation of the peace of Germany. His Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by their repreſentatives, not more generouſly than rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, reſolved to defend the Hanoverians if attacked in their quarrel. To anſwer this purpoſe, the miniſtry enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a ſubſidy treaty with the Empreſs of Ruſſia, in virtue of which ſhe was to hold 55,000 men in readineſs to be ſent on a requiſition wherever the Britiſh ſervice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                        <p>The alliance with Ruſſia was choſen for reaſons which were then ſufficiently plauſible; though it is to be hoped they can never ſubſiſt again. The long ill underſtanding between the King of Pruſſia and our court, and his cloſe connexion with that of Verſailles, raiſed no ill-grounded apprehenſions that he might be induced to act a dangerous part on this occaſion. Ruſſia was therefore a proper ally, who had both a political and perſonal enmity to this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and who would be ſure to employ a great power with great vigour in ſuch a cauſe. But this ſyſtem was in a ſhort time totally reverſed. The King of Pruſſia had been too well appriſed of the cloſe conjunction of the courts of Peterſburg and Vienna, and of the real motive to that conjunction, to have the leaſt deſign of embroiling himſelf with England. Matters were therefore very ſoon explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the treaty between his Pruſſian majeſty and this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1261701201:25"/>
court, to keep all foreigners out of the Empire, was ſigned at London in January 1756. Theſe treaties were cenſured as inconſiſtent with each other; but in reality they were conſiſtent enough, aiming preciſely at the ſame object, to oppoſe the ſchemes meditated by France for diſturbing the affairs of Germany.</p>
                        <p>If reflecting on the ſentiments of theſe courts, there was ſomething unexpected in the alliance between great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Pruſſia; it was ſoon followed by another alliance of a nature infinitely more ſurpriſing. The Empreſs Queen of Hungary, finding England in no diſpoſition to co-operate in her deſigns, had recourſe to other meaſures. The houſe of Auſtria, which had formerly united Europe to preſerve her from the power of France, now entered herſelf into the moſt intimate union with that power. By this extraordinary revolution the whole political ſyſtem of Europe aſſumed a new face; it was indeed a revolution ſo extraordinary, that we ſhall be juſtified if we interrupt the courſe of this narrative, to look back at the cauſes which produced it.</p>
                        <p>The houſe of Brandenbourg, a little more than two cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies ago, was in a very humble condition. But by the part ſhe took in the reformation, which put into her hands the eſtates of the Teutonic order; by a marriage from which ſhe acquired the duchy of Cleves; and by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common ſucceſſion of able princes who carefully improved every turn in the affairs of Germany to their advantage, ſhe raiſed herſelf by degrees to a conſiderable ſtate, to an electorate, and at laſt to a royalty, not only in name but in power. The late King of Pruſſia, in order to ſtrengthen this power, though he paſt almoſt his whole reign in the moſt profound peace, gave his whole attention to his army; frugal in all other reſpects, in this alone he was expenſive; it was his buſineſs, and what was perhaps of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was his only diverſion. Thus in a reign apparently inactive, there was always kept up an army of near 100,000 men, in as much exerciſe as they could have in war, and formed with the moſt perfect diſcipline.</p>
                        <p>When his preſent Majeſty came to the throne, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſhewed a diſpoſition of employing effectually that military force, which his father had ſpent his life only in forming and training. He managed his diſpute with the Biſhop of Liege by the ſummary method of force; and ſeemed diſpoſed to carry all things with ſo high an hand, as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1261701201:26"/>
made him indeed much reſpected, but much dreaded too by the Princes of the Empire, who ſaw that there was another power to be feared in Germany, beſides that of Auſtria. But theſe were ſmall matters, rather ſigns of the diſpoſition of this Prince, than exertions of it. He medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated much greater things; and only waited an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to make good the antient claims of his family on the moſt conſiderable part of the dutchy of Sileſia. The right to that dutchy had been a very intricate affair; but the houſe of Auſtria availing herſelf of the greatneſs of her power, and of a diſſention between the Elector Frederick II. and his ſon, prevailed with the Elector to give up that right for an equivalent; then ſhe perſuaded his ſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the treaty; and at the ſame time for a trivial conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to give up the equivalent itſelf. The King of Pruſſia, not thinking himſelf bound by theſe acts, though confirmed be a long poſſeſſion, took advantage of his own power, and the embarraſſed circumſtances of the houſe of Auſtria, to reſume what their power and the embarraſſed circumſtances of his family had formerly deprived him of. For immediately on the death of Charles the 6th,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Dec. 1740."/> 

 when the Auſtrian greatneſs ſeemed irrecoverably loſt, he entered into Sileſia, and made himſelf maſter of the whole country with little oppoſition. Then uniting with the French and Bavarians, he ſecured his conqueſts by two deciſive victories,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 11. 1742,"/> 

 and by a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which yielded him the greateſt part of Sileſia and the whole county of Glatz. But the cauſe of the Emperor which the King of Pruſſia had embraced, ſoon cauſed a renewal of hoſtilities; the Queen of Hungary ſaw herſelf defeated in three pitched battles; her new ally the King of Poland,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 2, 1744,"/> 

 driven from his German dominions, and the King of Pruſſia entering Dreſden in triumph, where he gave the law in a treaty, by which Sileſia was once more ſolemnly confirmed to him:

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Dec. 1745."/> 

 in return to which he guarantied to the Queen of Hungary the reſt of her dominions.</p>
                        <p>The Queen of Hungary could not eaſily loſe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the wound ſhe had received in the loſs of one of the fineſt and richeſt parts of all her dominions. Sileſia, which ſhe had juſt yielded, extended in length 200 miles along the courſe of the large and navigable river Oder.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1261701201:27"/>
A country of the moſt exquiſite fertility and higheſt cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; abounding with men, abounding with valuable manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and yielding a clear yearly revenue of 800,000 pounds ſterling. The peace was hardly concluded by which ſhe reſigned this valuable territory, than ſhe ſet on foot practices for recovering it. She entered into a treaty with the court of Peterſbourg, of an innocent and ſimply defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive nature, ſo far as appeared to the public; but ſix ſecret and ſeparate articles were added to it;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="May 22, 1746,"/> 

 one of which provides, that in caſe his Pruſſian majeſty ſhould attack her majeſty the Empreſs Queen, or the Empreſs of Ruſſia, or even the republic of Poland, that this attack ſhould be conſidered as a breach of the treaty of Dreſden; that the right of the Empreſs Queen to Sileſia ceded by that treaty ſhould revive; and that the contracting powers ſhould mutually furniſh an army of 60,000 men to re-inveſt the Empreſs Queen with that dutchy.</p>
                        <p>To this ſo extraordinary a treaty, the King of Poland was invited to accede; and he did ſo far accede to it, as to ſhew he perfectly agreed in his ſentiments with theſe courts. But his ſituation in the jaws of a formidable enemy, and the experience of paſſed misfortunes, had rendered him ſo weary, that he declined ſigning the treaty; but ſtill, with the conſent of the parties concerned, whom he fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his reſolution to co-operate in all their meaſures. He deſired and they agreed, that in the ſucceſs of their arms he ſhould have a ſhare in the ſpoil, on the footing of a treaty for the eventual portion, of the King of Pruſſia's dominions made in the laſt war.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="May 18, 1745."/> 

 On theſe conditions the King of Poland without actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſigning, was underſtood, and received as a party to the treaty of Peterſbourg.</p>
                        <p>In conſequence of theſe meaſures, all ſort of means were employed to embroil the King of Pruſſia's affairs in the North, and particularly to render him perſonally odious to the Czarina. When their machinations had taken full ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and Ruſſia was fixed in an unalterable enmity to that monarch, preparations of magazines and armies were made in Bohemia and Moravia; and the King of Poland, under pretence of a military amuſement, drew together about 16000 men, with which he occupied the ſtrong and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Poſt of Pirna. The Queen of Hungary ſaw that ſhe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1261701201:28"/>
ſtood in need of yet ſtronger ſupports than theſe in the arduous buſineſs ſhe had undertaken. She found that Great Britain, which had often done ſo much for her diſtreſs, would do little for her ambition: ſhe therefore had recourſe to France, who joyfully accepted an alliance, that promiſed to confound the whole Germanic body, concluded a treaty with the Empreſs at Verſailles the 1ſt of May 1756, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable aera in the political hiſtory of Europe.</p>
                        <p>The ſecret articles of the treaty of Peterſbourg, the fountain of the preſent troubles, and the ſteps taken to put that treaty in execution, though formed and carried on with as much ſecrecy as earneſtneſs, could not eſcape the vigilance of his Pruſſian majeſty, who watched all their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and had perfect intelligence of their moſt hidden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. When, therefore, he perceived that by the breach between England and France, the Empreſs Queen would take advantage of theſe troubles to avail herſelf of her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances and her armament; he ordered his miniſter at Vienna to demand a clear explication, and proper aſſurances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preparations he ſaw making: and receiving only a dry and equivocal anſwer, that the Empreſs had taken meaſures for her own ſecurity and that of her allies and friends, the King believed himſelf no longer bound to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any terms; a dangerous war was to be kept out of his own territories at any rate; and being always in perfect rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs for action, he fell upon Saxony with a conſiderable army.</p>
                        <p>At firſt the King of Pruſſia ſeemed only to demand a free paſſage for his troops, and an obſervance of the neutrality profeſſed by the King of Poland;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 29."/> 

 but as he had very good reaſon to diſtruſt ſuch a neutrality, he demanded as a ſecurity, that the Saxon troops ſhould quit the ſtrong poſt they occupied, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe themſelve immediately. This demand was refuſed, and the King of Pruſſia in conſequence of that refuſal, immediately formed a ſort of blockade about the Saxon camp at Pirna, with a view to reduce it by famine, ſince its inacceſſible ſituation rendered an attack unadviſeable. There were in Bohemia two Auſtrian armies under M. Brown and M. Picolomini; to keep them in awe, M. Schwerin had entered Bohemia from the county of Glatz; and M. Keith had penetrated into that kingdom on the ſide of Miſnia. But the King of Pruſſia, not entirely confiding in theſe diſpoſitions? and ſtill apprehenſive that M. Brown
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1261701201:29"/>
might be able to convey ſome relief to the Saxons, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring him to action, to the ſucceſs of which he knew his own preſence would greatly contribute. He therefore left the blockade of the Saxon army, joined his forces under Keith, and engaged the Auſtrians at Lowoſitz. Here he obtained a victory,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Dec. 1."/> 

 which though it was not undiſputed with regard to the field of battle, yet with regard to the conſequences it was as deciſive as could be wiſhed. M. Brown found it impracticable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Saxons, notwithſtanding the judicious efforts he made for that purpoſe; and that Army, after a vain attempt to retire from their difficult poſt, which had one fault, that it was as difficult to leave it as to force it, were obliged to ſurrender priſoners of war. The King of Poland quitted his German dominions; and the Pruſſians took up their winter quarters in Saxony, ſeized upon the revenues, levied exorbitant contributions, and obliged the country to furniſh recruits. This unhappy people ſaw their country exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and forced to bear the burthen of a war againſt itſelf. It was then that the King of Pruſſia conſulting the rules of policy more than thoſe of politeneſs, made himſelf maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the archieves at Dreſden, in doing which ſome rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was uſed towards the Queen; but he made himſelf amends for the clamour induſtriouſly raiſed on this pretence, by acquiring the originals of theſe pieces, which evinced to the world the reality of the deſign againſt him, and which therefore in a great meaſure juſtified the means he had taken to come at them, as well as the extraordinary ſeverities he uſed towards the unfortunate Saxons.</p>

                        <p>WHILST the King of Pruſſia paſſed the winter in the moſt vigorous preparations for carrying on the war, his ally Great Britain preſented a very different face of things. The loſs of Minorca plunged the people into the utmoſt grief mixed with ſhame, for ſuch a blot on the national honour, and with indignation not only
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1261701201:30"/>
againſt thoſe who had acted weakly, but thoſe who had proved inſufficiently for the loſs of that important poſſeſſion. The public reſentment which at firſt ſeemed to have no other object than Byng, was ſoon turned againſt the miniſtry. The clamour in parliament was great; without doors it was exceſſive. Addreſſes praying a ſtrict enquiry into the cauſe of our misfortunes, were preſented from all parts of the kingdom. The miniſtry, notwithſtanding this general diſcontent, had a real ſtrength; and they might have ſtood, had they agreed amongſt themſelves. The commons could not be brought to any angry votes; and the reſult of the enquiry into the loſs of Minorca, was as favourable as they could have wiſhed. But Mr. F—x thought it not adviſeable to bear a large proportion of the odium cauſed by counſels, in which he had little ſhare. Perhaps he thought this embarraſſment, a ſituation not unfavourable to the arrangement he had always aimed at? he therefore ſuddenly threw up an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, which he hoped to reſume augmented with greater power.</p>
                        <p>On the removal of this principal prop, the whole ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the miniſtry fell to pieces. The D. of N. the Ld. Ch. the firſt lord of the admiralty reſigned; and the chiefs of the party by whoſe manoeuvres they were diſplaced,

 naturally ſucceeded to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of affairs.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="April 5. 1757."/> 

 Thus was the helm of government a ſecond time abandoned. The caſe of the King and the nation was at that juncture truly deplorable. We were without any ally who could do us the leaſt ſervice, engaged in a war hitherto unſucceſsful, with the moſt formidable power in Europe; we almoſt deſpaired of our military virtue; public ſpirit appeared utterly extinguiſhed, whilſt the rage of faction burned with the utmoſt violence; our operations were totally ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1261701201:31"/>
and having no miniſtry eſtabliſhed, we had no plan to follow.</p>
                        <p>Three factions divided the ruling men of the nation, for the groſs of the people ſeemed to have no further views than a redreſs of their grievances, by whatever means that could be brought about; the firſt of theſe factions was compoſed of thoſe who had grown to place and power, or had formed their connexions under the old miniſtry. They were ſome of the moſt reſpectable perſons in the nation, and had undoubtedly the greateſt parliamentary intereſt. They had at the ſame time another intereſt hardly leſs conſiderable, that of the monied people; but in ſome points, and thoſe material too, they were weak. They were not at all popular; a matter of great conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in a government like ours; and they were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the groſs of the people, not to be under the direction of great political abilities.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond faction, though not ſuſpected of the want of ſufficient ability, was yet more unpopular than the former; they had not attempted to preſerve even the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances eſſential to popularity; and to them the more eſſential, as their parliamentary ſtrength was, however reſpectable, much inferior to the firſt. If their influence at one court was able to ballance that of the old miniſtry, by means of a then powerful connexion, that very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection made them far worſe at another court, and worſe with the generality of the people, who entertained or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at leaſt to entertain, ſuſpicions of a nature the more dangerous, as they were only dropped in hints and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and never could come to a full and open explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>The third party, had little parliamentary and leſs court influence; but they had a prodigious popularity, which ſupplied every other defect. The abilities of their leader were of the moſt ſhining kind; his application equal to his abilities; his diſintereſtedneſs was confeſſed by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and though it would have ſhined in the days of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſm, was now the more valued, and ſet off to the greater advantage by the general ſelfiſhneſs which prevailed among the men of buſineſs. The nation repoſed the moſt perfect confidence in his integrity and love to his country. This party, conſcious where its ſtrength lay, cultivated with great care the popularity which was the baſis of their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1261701201:32"/>
power; even perhaps ſo as to impair on ſome occaſion the dignity of government.</p>
                        <p>Theſe three factions differed from each other extremely with regard to power, the grand object of all factions. But in the general ſcheme of their politics, the two firſt were pretty much agreed. Looking on France as the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and moſt dangerous enemy of Great Britain, they dreaded the increaſe of her power and influence among the neighbouring nations as the greateſt of all evils. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſo dangerous an aggrandiſement, they thought it abſolutely neceſſary to preſerve a conſtant attention to the ballance of power, and to ſeek our particular ſafety and liberty in the general ſafety and liberty of Europe. A cloſe connection was therefore to be kept up with the powers of the continent, not only by continual negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but by large ſubſidies, and even by aſſiſting them with our troops if the occaſion ſhould require ſuch aſſiſtance. For this purpoſe, as well as to ſecure the more effectually our preſent happy eſtabliſhment, a conſiderable regular land force ought to be conſtantly maintained. Our navy, they thought, ought by no means to be neglected; but it was only to be cultivated and employed ſubſerviently to the more comprehenſive continental ſyſtem. Theſe parties were far from being friends to arbitrary power, or in any ſort averſe to parliaments; they loved the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; but they were for preſerving the authority of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment entire, and in its utmoſt lawful force. To make government more eaſy, knowing that many would diſturb it, from diſaffection or diſguſt, or miſtaken notions of liberty, they thought it juſt to rule men by their intereſts, if they could not by their virtues, and they had long been in the practice of procuring a majority in parliament, by the diſtribution of the numerous lucrative places and employments which our conſtitution leaves in the diſpoſal of the Crown. Several believed that no other method was practicable, conſidering the nature of mankind, and our particular form of government.</p>
                        <p>But the third and popular party, was influenced by different principles. They looked indeed on the power of France in the ſame light with the two former, and were of the ſame opinion concerning the neceſſity of ſetting bounds to it. In the means of attaining this end they differed. Our ſituation they thought dictated a narrower,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1261701201:33"/>
but a more natural, a ſafer, and a leſs expenſive plan of politics, than that which had been adopted by the other party. We ought never to forget, ſaid they, that we are an iſland: and that this circumſtance, ſo favourable both to our political and to our civil liberty, preſcribes to us a conduct very different from that of any other nation. Our natural ſtrength is a maritime ſtrength, as trade is our natural employment; theſe muſt always go hand in hand, and they mutually ſupport each other. But, if turning our back to our real intereſts, and abandoning our natural element, we enter that inextricable labyrinth of continental politics; if we make ourſelves parties in every controverſy; if we exhauſt our wealth in purchaſing the uſeleſs and precarious friendſhip of every petty prince or ſtate; if we waſte the blood of our people in all the quarrels that may ariſe on the continent; ſo far from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the right way to reduce France, that we attack her on the ſtrong ſide, and only deſtroy ourſelves by our ill judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed efforts againſt the enemy. That we can have nothing to fear from the ſuperiority of France on the continent, whilſt we preſerve our ſuperiority at ſea; that we can always cut the ſinews of the enemy's ſtrength by deſtroying their traffic; that to fear an invaſion from a power weak in its marine, is the idleſt of all fears; that in caſe an invaſion were poſſible, a well trained national militia, ſupplying by their zeal the defects of their diſcipline, would prove our beſt protection; that a ſtanding army is in whatever ſhape dangerous to freedom; and that a government like ours, connected by its very eſſence with the liberty of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, can never be in want of the ſupports of deſpotic power, As little is parliamentary influence neceſſary. A govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pleaſing to the people, as every good government muſt be, can never be generally oppoſed; and men need no bribes to perſuade them to their duty.</p>
                        <p>Theſe notions, ſo oppoſite in their extreams, might be reconciled in a medium, and uſed to temper each other. For as, on one hand, it would be very abſurd to make no ſort of advantage of our inſular ſituation, but to engage in all the buſineſs of the continent without reſerve, and to plunge ourſelves into real evils out of a dread of poſſible miſchiefs; ſo on the other hand, to think ourſelves wholly unconcerned in the fortunes of our neighbours on the continent, or to think of aiding them in any caſe, only
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1261701201:34"/>
by the way of diverſion with our fleets, would be a way of proceeding, ſtill more extravagant than the former. If ſuch notions were reduced to practice, we might ſoon loſe all thoſe advantages derived from a ſituation which we abuſed.</p>
                        <p>The reaſonableneſs of ſuch a temperament, could not be perceived during the ferment of that time, in which theſe topics were bandied to and fro with infinite heat. The reſignation, or rather deprivation, of the popular mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, only increaſed their popularity, and the general diſcontent; the people could not believe that good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures could be purſued, when thoſe, in whom alone they confided, were not employed; almoſt all the corporations of the kingdom preſented the deprived miniſters with their freedom, and addreſſed them in the warmeſt manner, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the moſt intire approbation of their conduct, and the ſincereſt concern to ſee them out of employment.</p>
                        <p>This conflict between an old eſtabliſhed intereſt, and the torrent of popularity, continued for a long time, and the nation was almoſt ruined by it. It is not eaſy, nor perhaps quite proper, to attempt to trace the ſteps by which ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a coalition, as we have ſeen take place, was brought about. But it was formed in ſuch manner, has held to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſuch ſolidity, and produced ſuch excellent effects,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 29. 1757."/> 

 as I believe the moſt ſanguine could not have hoped for at that time. Mr. P. was again reſtored to the office of ſecretary of ſtate, the D. of N. was placed at the head of the treaſury, Mr. F. was appointed paymaſter of the forces.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 14. 1756."/> 

 we heard of nothing but loſſes and calamities. In America we loſt the Fort of Oſwego. That fort, ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the mouth of the Onondaga river, commanded a commodious harbour on the Lake Ontario. It was built
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1261701201:35"/>
by General Shirley, and deſigned to cover the country of the Five Nations; to ſecure the Indian trade; to interrupt the communication between the French northern and ſouthern eſtabliſhments; and to open a way to our arms to attack the forts of Frontenac and Niagara. For theſe purpoſes, ſome frigates had been fitted out for cruizing, and a number of boats prepared for the tranſportation of troops; but they all fell to the enemy with the fort, where 100 pieces of cannon were, and a conſiderable quantity of proviſion. 1600 men were made priſoners of war. The place made but a trifling reſiſtance, ſcarce holding out three days; the attempts to relieve it were too late. The French demoliſhed the fort.</p>
                        <p>Our loſſes were not confined to America. The E. India company received a blow, which would have ſhaken an eſtabliſhment of leſs ſtrength to its foundations. The news of the war between France and England had not yet reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed India, but a new and very formidable enemy was raiſed up in that quarter. The Nabob of Bengal (the Nabobs are a ſpecies of viceroys to the Grand Mogul, grown almoſt independent in their ſeveral provinces,) irritated at the protection given to one of his ſubjects in the Engliſh fort of Calcutta, and, as it is ſaid, at the refuſal of ſome duties to which he claimed a right, levied a great army, and laid ſiege to that place. The Governor, terrified by the numbers of the enemy, abandoned the fort with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the principal perſons in the ſettlement, who ſaved themſelves with their moſt valuable effects on board the ſhips.</p>
                        <p>Thus deſerted. Mr. Hollwel, the ſecond in command, bravely held the place to the laſt extremity, with a few gallant friends, and the remains of a feeble garriſon. A very noble defence was inſufficient to keep an untenable place, or to affect an ungenerous enemy. The fort was taken, and the garriſon being made priſoners, were thruſt into a narrow dungeon.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 26."/> 

 Hollwel, with a few others, came out alive, to paint a ſcene of the moſt cruel diſtreſs which perhaps human nature ever ſuffered. The Eaſt India company loſt their principal ſettlement in Bengal, and a fort, which ſecured to them the moſt valuable part of their trade.</p>

                        <p>WHAT turn the Engliſh politics were like to take in the year 1759, ſeemed for ſome time uncertain. The new miniſtry did not ſeem well eſtabliſhed; nor was it well known, whether they would purſue the plans and preſerve the connections of the old. Abroad, every thing was prepared for opening the campaign with the utmoſt eclat. All Europe was in motion.</p>
                        <p>France, in order to demonſtrate to the Queen of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, the advantageous choice ſhe had made in connecting herſelf with the houſe of Bourbon, formed two great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The firſt was compoſed of near 80,000 men, the flower of the French troops, attended with a vaſt artillery and commanded by M. d'Etrees, a General of the beſt eſtabliſhed reputation ſhe had in her ſervice. Under him ſerved M. de Contades, M. Chevert, and the Count de St. Germain, all officers of high character, and all fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in chief, if M. d'Etrees had not been appointed to that eminence. This formidable army paſſed the Rhine, and marched by Weſtphalia, in order to invade the King of Pruſſia's dominions in quality of allies to the Empreſs Queen, and guardians of the liberties of the Empire, and to no other intent, as it was pretended; but in reality, with a view to reduce Hanover alſo. They judged that their operations againſt the King of Pruſſia might be executed, and their ſcheme to drive the King of England into ſome conceſſions with regard to America, might be compleated by one and the ſame blow. The ſecond army was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

by the Prince de Soubiſe; it conſiſted of about 25,000 men. This army was deſtined to ſtrengthen the Imperial army of execution; but before it had paſſed the Rhine, it made itſelf maſter of Cleves, Meurs and Gueldres, whilſt a detachment from d'Etrees's army ſeized upon the town of Emden, and whatever elſe belonged to Pruſſia in Eaſt Frieſland.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as the King of Pruſſia had entered Saxony in the beginning of the preceding ſummer, proceſs was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced againſt him in the Emperor's Aulic council, and before the diet of the Empire. It is not difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how the affair muſt have been decided; when thoſe who feared the King of Pruſſia, believed they had a fair opportunity to reduce him: and when thoſe who feared the houſe of Auſtria, were, by that very fear, obliged to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the power they dreaded: accuſtomed as they were to the influence of a family in which the Empire had ſo long been in a manner hereditary; and over-awed by the appearance of a confederacy, the moſt formidable the world had ever yet ſeen. Accordingly the King of Pruſſia was condemned for contumacy: and the Fiſcal had orders to notify to him that he was put under the ban of the Empire, and adjudged fallen from all the dignities and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions which he held under it. The circles of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire were ordered to furniſh their contingents of men and money to put this ſentence in execution; but the contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents were collected ſlowly, the troops were badly compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and probably this army had never been able to act, if it had not been for the Aſſiſtance offered under the Prince de Soubiſe.</p>
                        <p>The Auſtrians, who were principals in the quarrel, were not behind their auxiliaries in the greatneſs of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations; they made the moſt ſtrenuous efforts, by which they aſſembled a body of upwards of 100,000 men in Bohemia, and committed the command to Prince Charles of Lorrain, aſſiſted by M. Brown. In the north all things threatened the King of Pruſſia. The Czarina true to her reſentments and her engagements, had ſent a body of 60,000 men commanded by M. Apraxin, who were in full march to invade the Ducal Pruſſia, whilſt a ſtrong fleet was equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the Baltick, to co-operate with that army. Altho' the King of Sweden was allied in blood and inclination to his Pruſſian majeſty, yet the jealouſy which the Senate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1261701201:40"/>
of their ſovereign; the hope of recovering their antient poſſeſſions in Pomerania by means of the preſent troubles, and in fine their old attachment to France, newly cemented by intrigues and ſubſidies, made their ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to the cauſe of Pruſſia more than ſuſpicious. Hitherto indeed nothing more than the tendency of their councils was fully known. The Duke of Mecklenbourg took the ſame party, and agreed to join the Swediſh army when it ſhould be aſſembled, with 6000 men; a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he has ſince had reaſon to repent bitterly. Thus were the forces of five mighty ſtates 

<note n="*" place="bottom">Auſtria, Ruſſia, France, Sweden, the Empire.</note>

, each of which had in their turn been a terror to all Europe, united to reduce the heir of the Marquiſſes of Brandenbourg; and in ſuch a point of danger and glory, had the great and formidable abilities of his Pruſſian majeſty placed him, with little, in compariſon, that could enable him to ſuſtain the violence of ſo many ſhocks, except what thoſe abilities ſupplied. But his aſtoniſhing oeconomy, the incomparable order of his finances, the diſcipline of his armies beyond all praiſe, a ſagacity that foreſaw every thing, a vigilance that attended every thing, a conſtancy that no labour could ſubdue, a courage that no danger could diſmay, an intuitive glance that catches the deciſive moment, all theſe ſeemed to form a ſort of ballance to the vaſt weight againſt him, turned the wiſhes of his friends into hopes, and made them depend upon reſources that are not within the power of calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                        <p>The only army that appeared in his favour was a body of between 30 and 40,000 Hanoverians and Heſſians, who with ſome reinforcements of his own troops, formed an army of obſervation, commanded by his Royal Highneſs the Duke of Cumberland; this army was poſted on the Weſer, to watch the motions of M. d'Etrees. The vaſt and unwieldy body of the French, encumbered as the French armies always are by an immenſe baggage, and an innumerable multitude of mouths without hands, made a very ſlow progreſs through the rough and barren country that lies between the Rhine and the Weſer. All the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the French general were employed in finding ſubſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for his troops. His Royal Highneſs on the other hand, diſplayed great abilities in throwing all poſſible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments in his way. But when theſe impediments were removed by the ſuperiority of numbers, the Hanoverian
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1261701201:41"/>
army gradually gave way, yielding to that ſuperiority, and the French troops paſſed the Weſer without oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, his Pruſſian majeſty being determined according to his maxim, to lay the cloth as from home as poſſible; made his diſpoſitions for carrying the war into Bohemia as ſpeedily as the ſeaſon would admit. Three great bodies of his troops entered into that kingdom by three very different ways, but nearly at the ſame time. M. Schwerin penetrated into it from Sileſia. The Prince of Bevern entered with the corps under his command from Luſatia, and defeated as a preliminary to a more deciſive victory, a body of 28,000 Auſtrians who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Apr. 21."/> 

 The King himſelf prepared to enter Bohemia at a great diſtance from the corps com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by theſe Generals; and as he ſeemed diſpoſed to march towards Egra, the enemy imagined he intended to execute ſome deſign diſtinct from the object of his other armies. With this idea they detached a body of 20,000 men, to obſerve his motions. The King of Pruſſia find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this feint had all its effect, made a ſudden and maſterly movement to his left, by which he cut off all communication between that detachment and the main army of the Auſtrians. Spirited with this advantage, he puſhed onwards with the utmoſt rapidity to Prague, where he joined the corps under the prince of Bevern and M. Schwerin, who had advanced with inconceivable diligence to meet him. Never were operations executed with more judgment, celerity and ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>The Auſtrian army was little ſhort of 100,000 men, and the ſituation of their camp, fortified by every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of nature,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="May 6."/> 

 and every contrivance of art, ſuch as on common occaſions might juſtly be conſidered as impregnable; but the Pruſſians, being near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as numerous as the enemy, inſpired by a ſociety of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with their King, and filled with that noble enthuſiaſm, which, whilſt it urges to daring enterpriſes, almoſt enſures their ſucceſs, paſſed moraſſes, climed precipices, faced batteries, and after a bloody and obſtinate reſiſtance, totally defeated the Auſtrians. They took their camp, military cheſt, cannon, all the trophies of a complete victory. The loſs on the ſide of the victors, as well as the vanquiſhed, was very great; but both ſides had yet a greater loſs in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1261701201:42"/>
the death of two of the beſt generals in Europe. M. Schwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin was killed at the age of eighty-two, with the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels ſtandard in his hand at the head of his regiment. M. Brown received a wound, which, from the chagrin he ſuffered rather than from its own nature, proved mortal.</p>
                        <p>About 40,000 of the Auſtrian army took refuge in Prague. The reſt fled different ways. The King of Pruſſia loſt no time to inveſt the place, and to cut off all ſuccours. If on one hand ſuch an immenſe garriſon made an attack unadviſeable, on the other that formidable number itſelf ſeemed to make the reduction of the place by famine the more certain. The King of Pruſſia not relying ſolely on this, prepared to bombard the town. On the 29th of May, at midnight, after a moſt dreadful ſtorm of rain and thunder, as if it were to diſplay how much more ruinous the malice of men may be, than the greateſt terrors of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, on the ſignal of a rocket, four batteries, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged every twenty-four hours two hundred and eighty-eight bombs, beſides a vaſt multitude of red hot balls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to pour deſtruction on that unfortunate city, which was ſoon in flames in every part. The garriſon made a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous defence, and one well conducted and deſperate ſally: but they were repulſed with great loſs. The principal magiſtrates, burgeſſes, and clergy, ſeeing their city on the point of being reduced to an heap of rubbiſh, made the moſt moving ſupplications to the commander to liſten to terms. The commander was deaf to their prayers. Twelve thouſand of the moſt uſeleſs mouths were driven out of the city. The Pruſſians forced them in again. The affairs of the empreſs ſeemed verging to inevitable deſtruction; a whole army was upon the point of ſurrendering priſoners of war; the capital of Bohemia on the point of being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and with it all the reſt of that flouriſhing kingdom. The ſanguine friends to the King of Pruſſia began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the diſtance of Vienna.</p>
                        <p>In this deſperate ſituation of affairs, Leopold Count Daun entered on the ſtage, and began to turn the fortune of the war. This General never had commanded in chief before; but he was formed, by a long courſe of experience in various parts of Europe, under the greateſt Generals, and in the moſt illuſtrious ſcenes of actions. Though of a very noble family, he had, without the leaſt aſſiſtance from court favour, riſen inſenſibly by the ſlow gradation of mere
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1261701201:43"/>
merit, with much eſteem and without any noiſe. This General arrived within a few miles of Prague, the day after the great battle. He collected the fugitive parties of the Auſtrian army, and retired to a poſt of great ſtrength, from whence he fed the troops in Prague with hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. But as no man better underſtood the ſuperiority of the Pruſſian troops, and as he was ſenſible of the impreſſion which the late defeat had left upon his men, he carefully avoided to precipitate matters by an haſty action. He knew that the ſituation he had choſen would embarraſs the Pruſſians; that a large party of their army muſt be always employed to watch him; that this would weaken their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts againſt the great body ſhut up in Prague, whilſt his own forces gained time to recover their ſpirits, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in ſtrength by the daily ſuccours, which his court exerted all their powers to ſend him: with theſe ideas he waited in his entrenched camp at Colin, to act as events ſhould direct.</p>
                        <p>The King of Pruſſia was not leſs ſenſible than Count Daun of the effects of this conduct. He determined at all adventures to diſlodge him from the poſt he held; but whether it was that the King feared to weaken his army, which had actually an army to beſiege, or whether he was blinded by a train of uniform ſucceſs, which made him believe his arms irreſiſtable under every diſadvantage, or whatever were his motives or neceſſities, the whole army employed in this undertaking, including the Prince of Bevern's corps, did not exceed 32,000 men, cavalry and infantry; and with theſe he was to attack 60,000 men, in one of the ſtrongeſt ſituations which could be choſen,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 18."/> 

 and defended by a vaſt train of artillery. Whatever the moſt impetuous and well regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted courage, whatever an ardor inſpired by the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſo many victories could do towards overcoming every kind of diſadvantage, was done by the Pruſſians on this occaſion. They returned to the attack ſeven times: in none of their victorious battles had their bravery been more conſpicuous. Both the King's brothers were in the field; and they did every thing that could be expected from the King of Pruſſia's brothers. The King himſelf at the head of his cavalry, made one furious and concluding charge. Every thing was tried, and every thing was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful. The want of a ſufficiently numerous infantry,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1261701201:44"/>
in a ground where his cavalry could not ſupport them, the want of an equal artillery, the advantageous ſituation of the enemy, their numbers, their bravery, their General, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the King of Pruſſia to quit the field. What his loſs was is not ſo certain; it wa s undoubtedly great in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſtill greater by deſertions, and the innumerable ill conſequences that follow a defeat.</p>
                        <p>Though the King of Pruſſia was defeated in this battle, and though he brought on his defeat in a great meaſure, by ſome errors of his own, yet whatever ſmall blemiſh his military ſkill might have ſuffered, his reputation was raiſed higher than ever, in the opinion of all judicious men, by the noble and candid manner in which he acknowledged his miſtake, by the firmneſs with which he bore his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and by thoſe aſtoniſhing ſtrokes of genius and heroiſm, by which he retrived his loſs. The ſmiles of fortune make conquerors; it is her malice which diſcovers heroes.</p>

Though the King retired unpurſued by his enemies, he was obliged to rejoin his own army before Prague without delay, and to raiſe the blockade of that place. The impriſoned Auſtrians with joy received Count Daun their deliverer, and their united forces became greatly ſuperior to the Pruſſians. The King was in a ſhort time obliged to evacuate Bohemia, and take refuge in Saxony. The Auſtrians haraſſed him as much as poſſible; but their armies, notwithſtanding their great ſuperiority, were not in a condition from their late ſufferings to make any deciſive attempt upon him, as the

                        <p>The King of Pruſſia's misfortunes now poured in upon him at once, and from every quarter.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 25."/> 

 and retreated towards Stade. By taking this route his Royal Highneſs was driven into a ſort of <hi>cul de ſac.</hi> Unable by his ſituation to retire, or by his ſtrength to advance, he was compelled to ſign the remarkable capitulation of Cloſter-ſeven,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sept. 7."/> 

 by which 38,000 Hanoverians laid down their arms, and were diſperſed into different quarters of cantonment. The French army had a little before this changed its commander. D'Etrees, the favourite of all the military men, was removed from the command, which was conferred on the Duke de Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu, who excelled him and all mankind in the profeſſion of a courtier. The Hanoverians were now quite ſubdued, and all the French force, let looſe by this treaty, was ready to fall in upon the King of Pruſſia's dominions.</p>
                        <p>An enterprize was concerted in England againſt the coaſt of France, to make a diverſion in his favour, by drawing a part of the French army to the defence of their own country. England propoſed to compaſs another great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and which ſhe had equally at heart, by the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was to give an effectual blow to the marine of France. The deſtination of this armament was kept a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſecret, and whilſt it excerciſed the penetration of all the politicians of Europe, it filled France with the moſt ſerious alarms. The Engliſh Fleet at laſt appeared before Rochfort. Some time was ſpent before it could be reſolved what plan was to be followed in the attack;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sep. 21."/> 

 at laſt it was reſolved to ſecure the ſmall iſle of Aix, from whence ſome obſtruction was apprehended to their landing. The iſland was ſoon reduced; but as a good deal of time was conſumed in theſe deliberations and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1261701201:46"/>
actions, the militia of the country had time to gather, and there was an appearance of two camps on the ſhore. The commanders now took into conſideration the badneſs of the coaſt, the danger of landing, the time the enemy had to put the place in ſuch a poſture of defence, as might make any ſudden attempt, or <hi>coup de main,</hi> unſucceſsful: in conſequence of theſe deliberations, they unanimouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to return without making any attempt. The diſappointment of the nation was equal to the ſanguine hopes we had conceived;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sep. 29."/> 

 nothing could exceed the general diſcontent. The military men blamed the plan of the expedition. The Miniſters, and with them the public voice, exclaimed at the execution. A <hi>court of enquiry,</hi> of officers of reputation, cenſured the commander; a <hi>court martial,</hi> of officers of reputation, acquitted him. The expedition ſerved only in England to increaſe and imbitter our diſſentions, and to turn our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to vain diſputes. It did nothing towards relieving the King of Pruſſia.</p>
                        <p>The Ruſſians, who had made for a long time a dilatory march and ſeemed uncertain of their own reſolution, all at once haſtened their motions. They entered the Ducal Pruſſia under M. Apraxin and General Fermer, and marked their progreſs by a thouſand inhuman cruelties. A large body of Auſtrians entered Sileſia, and penetrated as far as Breſlau. Then they made a turn backwards, and laid ſiege to the important fortreſs of Schweidnitz, juſtly conſidered as the key of that dutchy, which was the cauſe of the war. Another body entered Luſatia, and made themſelves maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Zittau. Twenty-two thouſand Swedes pierced into the Pruſſian Pomerania, took the towns of Anclam and Demmein, and laid the whole country under contributions. Richlieu, freed from all oppoſition on the ſide of Hanover, made his way into Halberſtad, and the old marche of Brandenburgh, firſt exacting contributions, and then plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the towns. The army of the Empire, reinforced by that of the Prince de Soubiſe, after many delays, was at laſt on full march to enter Saxony; this left the Auſtrians at liberty to turn the greateſt part of their forces to the reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sileſia. General Haddick pierced through Luſatia, paſſed by the Pruſſian armies, and, ſuddenly preſenting himſelf before the gates of Berlin, laid the King of Pruſſia's capital under contribution; and though he retired on the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1261701201:47"/>
approach of a body of Pruſſians, yet he ſtill kept poſſeſſion of his former poſt, in order to interrupt the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King with Sileſia. The fate which ſeemed to have threatened the Empreſs ſome months ago, was now looked upon as the certain lot of her antagoniſt. All his endeavours to retrieve his affairs had hitherto been equally brave and unſucceſsful. General Lehwald had orders at any hazard to engage the Ruſſians: with thirty thouſand he attacked double that number ſtrongly entrenched, at a place called Norkitten; but after ſeveral of thoſe wonderful efforts,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 30."/> 

 which the Pruſſians alone knew how to make, he was compelled to retire; but he retired in excellent order, without being purſued, having killed five times more of the enemy, than he had loſt of his own men, and more formidable after his defeat, than the Ruſſians after their victory. The King of Pruſſia exerted himſelf upon every ſide; his enemies almoſt always fled before him; but whilſt he purſued one body, another gained in ſome other part upon him, and the winter came on faſt, as his ſtrength decayed, and his adverſaries multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied from every quarter. The following letter which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the public papers about this time, paints the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of that diſtreſſed monarch, in ſo full a manner, that I ſhall attempt no other deſcription of it.</p>
                        <p>"Many perſons, who ſaw the King of Pruſſia, when he paſſed lately through Leipſic, cannot expreſs how much he is altered. They ſay he is ſo much worn away, that they ſcarce knew him. This, indeed, is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at; he hath not a body of iron, like Charles XII. and he endures as great fatigues as he did. He is as much on horſeback as Charles was, and often lies upon the ground. His inward ſufferings cannot be leſs than his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: let us caſt our eyes on a map of the Pruſſian domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and meaſure what he hath left of the many fair poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions he had in the month of April laſt, of which a ſpace of ſeven months hath ſtript him. Whence can he have men? he is ſhut out from the Empire; and from whence can he draw money? the dutchy of Guelders, the dutchy of Cleves, the principality of Moers, the county of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, the county of Lipſtadt, the principality of Minden, Eaſt-Frieſland, Embden, and its infant company, part of the archbiſhoprick of Magdeburgh, ſome other parts of the marche, Ducal Pomerania, a great part of Sileſia, a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1261701201:48"/>
great part of the kingdom of Pruſſia, Berlin itſelf, almoſt all his dominions, in ſhort, are either taken from him, or laid under contribution, and poſſeſſed by his enemies, who collect the public revenues, fatten on the contributions, and with the money which they draw from the electorate of Hanover, and other conqueſts defray the expences of the war. This picture certainly differs greatly from that which the King of Pruſſia might have ſketched out, the day he took arms to enter Saxony. Add to this the Duke of Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland's convention, which deprived him of all his allies, and left him without any aſſiſtance whatever, excepting four or five hundred thouſand pounds ſterling, which the Britiſh parliament may give him. Add likewiſe ſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic uneaſineſſes."</p>

                           <p>Battle of Roſbach, Schwaidnitz taken by the Auſtrians. Prince of Bevern attacked in his entrenchments. Breſlau taken by the Auſtrians.

                        </argument>
                        <p>THIS was the King of Pruſſia's ſituation, when the will of Providence, and his own wonderful abilities, as wonderfully changed the ſcene. His majeſty deferred to bring on a deciſive action, diſtreſſed as his affairs were, until the approach of winter; had he marched to attack the Imperial army, whilſt it was at a conſiderable diſtance, he muſt either have left Saxony expoſed to the inſults of the Auſtrian parties, or have greatly weakened his own forces employed in the principal action. He therefore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the army of the Empire to advance to the frontiers of Miſnia, and even to threaten the ſiege of Leipſic, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he began to act againſt them: he however moved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, leaving an army in Luſatia to obſerve the Auſtrians. On his firſt motions, the enemy retired with precipitation. But when they had reinforced themſelves with numbers and courage ſufficient to perſuade them to advance, the King of Pruſſia in his turn retired. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution ſeemed to have been to fight as near Miſnia as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and as deep in the winter, as he conveniently might, for if he ſhould have the good fortune to ſucceed againſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1261701201:49"/>
the Imperial army, ſuch a blow, at ſuch a ſeaſon, would effectually diſable them from acting any thing to his preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, for that year at leaſt; but if, on the contrary, he ſhould fail, Saxony was at hand, in which it would prove difficult for the enemy to make any impreſſion whilſt the winter continued. As for the time to be loſt by following this plan, and the advantage it would afford the Auſtrians in their deſigns on Sileſia, they were not to be compared with the advantages which the King received from it. He knew that Schweidnitz was ſtrong, and excellently provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; the prince of Bevern was ſtrongly poſted near it to obſtruct the enemy's operations; the winter would lean heavier on the beſiegers; and on the whole, he had reaſon to truſt that his troops, animated by his own preſence and example, would prove far ſuperior to the enemy, in endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the hardſhips of a winter campaign.</p>
                        <p>After ſome time ſpent in various movements, between the allied army of the Imperialiſts and French on one ſide, and the Pruſſians on the other, the King reſolved to give battle to his enemies, who were now advanced to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of Miſnia. On the 24th of October, the King had taken his reſolution; at that time his army happened to be divided into ſeveral corps, ſome of them at a diſtance of no leſs than twenty leagues aſunder; yet ſuch were the ſpirit and excellent diſpoſitions of the Pruſſians, that the junction of all theſe corps were fully effected on the 27th, and the King advanced towards the enemy. The enemy fell back at his approach, and repaſſed the Sala; they were followed cloſe.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Nov. 5."/> 

 The two armies met near the village of Roſbach.</p>
                        <p>The united army, commanded by the prince of Saxe Hilburghauſen and the prince of Soubiſe, was 50,000 men compleat. But the troops of the Circles were new raiſed, and many of them not well affected to the ſervice, nor to their French allies. The Pruſſians did not amount to 25,000; but then they were Pruſſians, and led on by the King of Pruſſia. As ſoon as the armies were formed, and the battle going to begin, which was to decide the fate of ſo many nations, and to determine between force and virtue, the King of Pruſſia addreſſed his troops nearly in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>My dear friends, the hour is come, in which all that is, and all that ought to be dear to us, depends upon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1261701201:50"/>
the ſwords which are now drawn for the battle. Time permits me to ſay but little; nor is there occaſion to ſay much. You know that there is no labour, no hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, no cold, no watching, no danger that I have not ſhared with you hitherto; and you now ſee me ready to lay down my life with you, and for you. All I aſk, is the ſame pledge of fidelity and affection that I give. And let me add, not as an incitement to your courage, but as a teſtimony of my own gratitude, that from this hour, until you go into quarters, your pay ſhall be double. Acquit yourſelves like men, and put your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God.</q>
The effect of this ſpeech was ſuch as cannot be deſcribed. The general emotion burſt in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſhout, and the looks and demeanor of the men were animated to a ſort of heroic phrenſy. In this diſpoſition, which prognoſticated the ſucceſs, engagement began.</p>
                        <p>In the beginning of the action, the French cavalry came on with great ſpirit, but they were repulſed; ſome regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments having gained an eminence, defended themſelves bravely, but in the end they were totally routed. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, both French and Imperialiſts, made but a faint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. The King of Pruſſia in perſon, expoſed to the hotteſt fire, led on his troops; the enemy gave way in every part; they were ſeized with a panic, and fled in the utmoſt diſorder. They left 3000 men dead on the field of battle; 63 pieces of cannon, and many colours. Eight French generals, 250 officers of different ranks, and 6000 private men were taken. Night alone ſaved from total deſtruction the ſcattered remains of an army that in the morning was ſo numerous and ſo formidable.</p>
                        <p>I have not undertaken on this, nor ſhall I undertake upon any other occaſion, in theſe preliminary chapters, to enter into the detail of all the various manoeuvres of every battle; they are matters little underſtood by, and little intereſting to, the generality of readers. Beſides, the accounts are ſometimes inaccurate, and ſeldom or never conſiſtent with each other.</p>
                        <p>The glorious ſucceſs of the battle of Roſbach, was ſuch as hardly wanted to be improved; the enemy was left to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally incapable of action. The King was ſet free on that ſide; but it was a freedom which gave him no reſpite from his labours; it only gave him an opportunity of undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1261701201:51"/>
new labours in another part. The Auſtrians had a vaſt force, and had now begun to make a proportionable progreſs in Sileſia. The dependance which the King had upon the fidelity of his Generals there, ſeemed ſhaken by ſomething which then appeared, and ſtill ſeems ambiguous in their conduct. The Auſtrians after a ſiege from the 27th of October to the 11th of November, carried on under infinite difficulties and with a prodigious loſs, had reduced Schweidnitz, and obliged the Pruſſian garriſon of 4000 men to ſurrender priſoners of war. Soon after, as they had intelligence of the victory of Roſbach, and knew that the king of Pruſſia was on full march to the relief of Sileſia, the Auſtrians reſolved to loſe no time to attack the prince of Bevern in his ſtrong camp under the walls of Breſlau. A treble ſuperiority incited them to this attempt. They attacked the prince's army with great reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and their attack was ſuſtained with amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intrepidity.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Nov. 22."/> 

 The ſlaughter of the Auſtrians was prodigious. A great part of their army had retired from the field of battle, and the reſt were preparing to retire; when all at once the Pruſſian Generals unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly took the ſame reſolution. A part of their army had ſuffered a great deal in the engagement. They became apprehenſive of a total defeat, in caſe their intrenchments ſhould be forced in any part, With theſe ideas they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated from the ſtrong poſt they occupied, and retired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Oder.. The Auſtrians returning, with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſaw themſelves maſters of the field of battle, which they had but juſt been obliged to relinquiſh. What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and what gave riſe to many conjectures, the Prince of Bevern going to reconnoitre without eſcort, and attended only by a groom, was taken two days after the battle by an advanced party of Croats, a ſmall body of whom had croſſed the Oder.</p>
                        <p>This advantage, though dearly bought, was immediately followed with many others. Breſlau, the capital of Sileſia,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Nov. 24."/> 

 immediately ſurrendered, where, as well as at Schweidnitz, they found vaſt ſtores of proviſion, ammunition and money. All Sileſia was on the point of falling into their hands. Fortune ſeems every where to have thrown the King of Pruſſia's affairs into diſtraction, in order to raiſe, and as it were, to round his glory in eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing them; and to have been even ſo jealous of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1261701201:52"/>
as not to permit his own excellent generals and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable troops to triumph any where but in his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                        <p>The King immediately after the battle of Roſbach, with thoſe troops which he had a few days before collected from places an hundred miles diſtant from each other, began a march of upwards of two hundred more, and led them from engaging one ſuperior army, to engage another ſtill more ſuperior; from danger to hardſhip, and from hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to renewed danger. In the moſt rapid march he paſſed through Thuringia, through Miſnia, through Luſatia, in ſpite of the efforts of the Generals Haddick and Marſhal, who were poſted in Luſatia to obſtruct him; and entering Sileſia arrived the 2d of December at Parchwitz upon the Oder. Here he was joined by the Prince of Bevern's corps who croſſed that river to meet him.</p>
                        <p>About this time an incident happened which was very remarkable; one of theſe agreeable adventures that relieve the mind amidſt the perpetual horror that attends a narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of battles and bloodſhed. The garriſon of Schweid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitz had ſeen, with the greateſt reluctance, the capitulation which bound their hands from the Service of their King and Country. Whilſt the Auſtrians were conducting them to priſon, on their route they chanced to hear of the victory their maſter had gained at Roſbach; animated with this news, they unanimouſly roſe upon the eſcorte which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them, and which happened not to be very ſtrong, and entirely diſperſed it. Thus freed, they marched on not very certain of their way, in hope to rejoin ſome corps of the Pruſſian troops. The ſame fortune which freed them, led them directly to the army commanded by the King himſelf, which was haſtening to their relief. Great was the joy on both ſides at this unexpected meeting, for the priſoners had heard nothing of his Majeſty's march. This little incident, whilſt it added a conſiderable ſtrength to the army, added likewiſe to its ſpirit, and ſeemed an happy omen of ſucceſs in the future engagement.</p>
                        <p>As his Pruſſian majeſty approached to Breſlau, the Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trians confiding in their ſuperiority, abandoned their ſtrong camp (the ſame which had been occupied by the Prince of Bevern) and reſolved to give the King battle. He was marching with the utmoſt diligence not to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Dec. 5."/> 

 and they met near the village of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1261701201:53"/>
Leuthen. The ground which the Auſtrians occupied was very advantageous, and every advantage of the ſituation was improved to the utmoſt, by the diligence and ſkill of Count Daun; who remembring that he was the only Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral who had ever carried the field from the King of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, knew better than any body how difficult it was to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch a victory. All the diſpoſitions were made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; the ground they occupied was a plain, except that in ſome part it had ſmall eminences; theſe they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with artillery; the ground was alſo interſperſed with thickets, which they ſought to turn to their advantage. On their right and left were hills on which they planted batteries of cannon. The ground in their front was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected by many cauſeways; and to make the whole more impracticable, the Auſtrians had felled a vaſt many trees, and ſcattered them in the way. The King of Pruſſia was not terrified with this ſituation, nor with the conſciouſneſs that above 70,000 excellent troops, commanded by Count Daun, were ſo poſted. The Pruſſians, who did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, as it is ſaid, 36,000 men, attacked them with their uſual reſolution. It was almoſt impoſſible, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the engagement, for the Pruſſian horſe to act, on account of the impediments we have juſt mentioned, but a moſt judicious diſpoſition of the King himſelf overcame that diſadvantage; he had in his firſt diſpoſitions placed four batallions behind the cavalry of his right wing, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that General Nadaſti, who was placed with a corps de reſerve on the enemies left, deſigned to take him in flank. It happened as he had foreſeen; that General's horſe attacked the King's right wing with great fury; but he was received with ſo ſevere a fire from the four battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he was obliged to retire in diſorder. Then the King's flank well covered and ſupported, was enabled to act with ſuch order and vigour, that the enemy's right was obliged to give way. The Pruſſian artillery, which was incomparably ſerved, and ſilenced that of the enemy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to maintain the King's infantry, and to enable them to act in grounds where their horſe could give them but little aſſiſtance. The Auſtrians made a gallant reſiſtance during the whole battle. The panic of the enemy did not here, as at Roſbach, do half the buſineſs; every foot of ground was well diſputed. The Auſtrians rallied all their forces about Leuthen, which was defended upon all ſides
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1261701201:54"/>
with intrenchments and redoubts. After reiterated attacks made with the utmoſt impetuoſity, and ſuſtained with great firmneſs, the Pruſſians maſtered the poſt; then the Auſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans fled on all parts; they were entirely routed. The King purſued them to Liſſa. 6000 of the Auſtrians were ſlain, 15,000 were made priſoners; and an immenſe artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, upwards of 200 pieces of cannon were taken.</p>
                        <p>This great and deciſive action was fought on the very ſame day of the next month after the no leſs important and deciſive battle of Roſbach. The conſequences that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the action of Leuthen, declared the entireneſs of the victory. Notwithſtanding the rigour of the ſeaſon, the ſiege of Breſlau was immediately undertaken, and proſecuted with ſuch ſpirit, that by the 29th of December it ſurrendered; and with it ſurrendered the garriſon of 13,000 men priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of war; the blockade of Schweidnitz was formed as cloſely as the inclemency of the winter would permit; whilſt the Pruſſian parties not only re-poſſesſed thoſe parts of Sileſia which belonged to the King, but penetrating into the Auſtrian diviſion, reduced Jagerndorf, Troppau, and Tetſchen, and left to the Empreſs Queen, except a forlorn garriſon in Schweidnitz, no ſort of footing in that country, in which a few days before ſhe reckoned her dominion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly eſtabliſhed.</p>

                        <p>AS the misfortunes of his Pruſſian Majeſty, after the battle of Colin, came on him all at once, ſo his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, after his victories at Roſbach and Liſſa, flowed upon him all at once likewiſe, and in a full tide. The Ruſſians, though they had repulſed General Lehwald, ſuffered ſo much in that action, and their barbarous method of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war had ſo deſtroyed the country, that they ſeemed to themſelves to have no way of ſafety left but in retiring out of the Pruſſian territories. This extraordinary retreat of ſo great an army, and ſo lately victorious, and ſtill poſſeſſed of a good ſea-port in the country, could ſcarcely be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1261701201:55"/>
for on thoſe motives we have aſſigned, and aſtoniſhed all Europe, whilſt it left Gen. Lehwald at liberty to turn his arms into Pomerania againſt the Swedes. The Swedes on this occaſion did nothing worthy of their ancient military fame; but every where retiring, left the Pruſſians an eaſy conqueſt, not only of the Pruſſian but of every part of the Swediſh Pomerania, excepting the port of Stralſund; they left their allies of Mecklenbourg quite expoſed to all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of the King of Pruſſia, who chaſtiſed them with the moſt ſevere contributions and levies. The French, who had been ravaging the old marche of Brandenburg, evacuated that country immediately after the battle of Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bach. But one of the greateſt revolutions of fortune in the war, and one of the moſt glorious and important conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of that victory, was, that the Hanoverian troops were enabled to reſume their arms.</p>
                        <p>From the moment the capitulation of Cloſter-ſeven was ſigned, the Duke the Richlieu, who came to the command only to reap the advantages, and ſully the honour of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other's conqueſt, ſeemed to think of nothing but how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, from the plunder of the unhappy Hanoverians, the fortune which he had ſhattered by a thouſand vices. The moſt exorbitant contributions were levied with the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible ſeverity; every exaction, which was ſubmitted to, only produced a new one ſtill more extravagant; and all the orderly methods of plunder did not exempt them from the pillage, licenciouſneſs, and inſolence of the French ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery. However, in juſtice to merit, we muſt exempt from this general charge the conduct of the duke de Randan, Governor of Hanover for the French; who ſaved the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of the Electorate from utter ruin by the ſtrictneſs of his diſcipline, by the prudence, the juſtice and moderation of all his conduct; a conduct which does more real honour to his name, than the moſt ſplendid victories.</p>
                        <p>The Duke de Richlieu's rapaciouſneſs and oppreſſion, whilſt they leaned ſo heavily on the conquered people, did the conquering army no kind of ſervice. Intent only on plunder, which he did not confine to the enemy, he relaxed every part of military diſcipline; and that numerous army which M. d'Etrees had ſuſtained, and brought in health and ſpirits through the diſmal deſarts of Weſtphalia, under all the oppoſition of a ſkilful adverſary, were now, in full peace, in the quiet poſſeſſion of a conquered and plentiful country,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1261701201:56"/>
reduced in their numbers, decayed in their health, and their ſpirits, without cloaths, without ſubſiſtance, without order, without arms. In this condition they began at laſt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the Hanoverians, with the yoke of the capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about their necks, were ſtill formidable. As they had broke almoſt every article of that treaty, they made no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to add another breach in order to ſecure them in all the reſt. They attempted actually to take their arms from the Hanoverian and Heſſian troops. Theſe gallant troops, who had with a ſilent grief and indignation ſeen the diſtreſſes of their ruined country, were raviſhed to find that the victory at Roſbach encouraged their ſovereign to reſent at laſt this and all the other indignities they had ſuffered. They began to collect and to act, and under the command of the gallant Prince Ferdinand of Brunſwick, reinforced with a body of Pruſſian troops, they broke from their confinement. They reduced the town of Harburg, and laid cloſe ſiege to the caſtle, which it muſt be owned was defended very bravely. In all other reſpects the French did not ſeem in a condition to maintain their ground any where. Thoſe troops, which a few months before had ſo ſubmitted as to make it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to declare that they were <hi>not priſoners of war,</hi> in order to explain their condition, were now on the point of puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their adverſaries to almoſt the ſame ſtreights. Such was the force of French military diſcipline, and ſuch the triumphs of Voltaire's hero.</p>
                        <p>The King of Pruſſia now ſaw the full effect of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and his labours. His dominions were freed; his allies were enabled to aſſiſt him; and his enemies defeated, broken, and flying every where before him. In what light poſterity will view theſe things is uncertain; we, under whoſe eyes, as we may ſay, they were atchieved, ſcarcely believed what we had ſeen. And perhaps in all the records of time, the compaſs of a ſingle year, on the ſcene of a ſingle country, never contained ſo many ſtriking events, never diſplayed ſo many revolutions of fortune; revolutiens not only beyond what might have been expected, but far beyond what the moſt ſagacious foreſight, reaſoning from experience, and the nature of things, could poſſibly have imagined. The King of Pruſſia at firſt triumphant: the whole power of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrians totally defeated; their hopes utterly ruined: then their affairs ſuddenly re-eſtabliſhed, their armies victorious, and the King of Pruſſia in his turn hurled down; defeated;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1261701201:57"/>
abandoned by his allies; ſurrounded by his enemies; on the very edge of deſpair: then all at once raiſed beyond all hope, he ſees the united Auſtrian, Imperial, and French power levelled with the ground; 40,000 Hanoverians, a whole army, ſubmit to 80,000 French, and are only <hi>not</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of war. The French are peacable maſters of all the country between the Weſer and the Elbe: anon, theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued Hanoverians reſume their arms; they recover their country, and the French in a little time think themſelves not ſecure to the eaſtward of the Rhine. 500,000 men in action. Six pitched battles fought. Three great armies annihilated. The French army reduced and vanquiſhed without fighting. The Ruſſians victorious, and flying as if they had been vanquiſhed. A confederacy, not of ſamller potentates to humble one great power, but of five the greateſt powers on earth to reduce one ſmall potentate; all the force of theſe powers exerted and baffled. It happened as we have related; and it is not the hiſtory of a century, but of a ſingle campaign.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>WITH regard to the part we had in the tranſactions of this year, though it was not ſo full of ſtriking events, nor does it afford ſuch a ſplendid ſubject for narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, yet it is as interreſting to an Engliſh reader, and may perhaps prove more inſtructive; as it ſhews us in ſo ſtrong a light, the miſerable conſequences of our political diviſions, which produced a general unſteadineſs in all out purſuits, and infuſed a langour and inactivity into all our military ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. For, whilſt our commanders abroad knew not who were to reward their ſervices or puniſh their neglects, and were not aſſured in what light even the beſt of their actions would be conſidered, (having reaſon to apprehend that they might not be judged of as they were in themſelves, but as their appearances might anſwer the end of ſome ruling fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;)
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1261701201:58"/>
they naturally wanted that firmneſs and that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing reſolution, without which the beſt capacity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions the moſt honeſt, can do nothing in war. The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of moſt men to their parties, weakened their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to their country. It has been imagined that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters did not always wiſh ſucceſs even to their own ſchemes leſt obnoxious men ſhould acquire credit by the execution of them; as it was ſuſpected that officers even at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their own reputation, did not exert their faculties to the utmoſt, leſt a diſagreeable miniſterial ſyſtem ſhould eſtabliſh the credit of its counſels by the vigour of their operations. For my part, I think that theſe refinements, in which there is often as much malice diſcovered as penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have carried the matter infinitely too far. But certain it is, that the ſpirit of perſonal parties and attachments, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver carried to greater lengths than at that time, proved of very bad conſequences, if it had no other effect than to raiſe and to give a colour to ſuch ſuſpicions as we have firſt mentioned. Whatever was the cauſe, it is moſt certain, that our ſucceſs in America this year, no more anſwered to the greatneſs of our preparations and our hopes than it did in the two preceding.</p>
                        <p>The attack upon Crown Point, which had been a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal object of our attention in the beginning, ſeemed at this time to be laid aſide; and an expedition to Louiſbourg, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a more conſiderable object in itſelf, ſupplied its place. Lord Loudoun was to command the land forces in this expedition; Admiral Holborn the navy. The former left New York with a body of 6000 men, and ſailed to Halifax, where he was joined by the latter,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 9."/> 

 who had ſailed from Corke on the 7th of May with a conſiderable fleet, and much the ſame number of land forces, which his Lordſhip had brought from New York. When the united armies and fleets were on the point of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting for Louiſbourg, news arrived at Halifax, that the Breſt fleet conſiſting of ſeventeen ſhips of the line beſides frigates, with great ſupplies of military ſtores, proviſions, and men, were arrived at the harbour which they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to attack. This news immediately ſuſpended their preparations. Councils of war were held one after another. The reſult of the whole was, that as the place was ſo well reinforced, the fleet of the French rather ſuperior to our navy, and the ſeaſon ſo far advanced, it was the more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1261701201:59"/>
courſe to defer the enterpriſe to a more favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. This reſolution ſeems to have been moſt eligible in their circumſtances, becauſe the council of war was almoſt unanimous in it.</p>
                        <p>Lord Loudoun returned to New York, and the Admiral now freed from the care of the tranſports ſet ſail for Louiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, in hopes as it was ſaid, of drawing the French fleet to an engagement. But upon what grounds this hope was conceived, I confeſs I cannot ſee; as it could not be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that the French fleet having no ſort of occaſion to fight in order to protect Louiſbourg, would chuſe out of a bravado to bring on an unneceſſary battle. However it was, the Engliſh ſquadron continued to cruize off that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour until the 25th of September, when they were overtaken by a terrible ſtorm, in which one of our ſhips was loſt, eleven diſmaſted, and the reſt returned to England in a very ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered condition. This was the end of the expedition to Louiſbourg from which ſo much was expected. But it was not the worſt conſequences which attended it.</p>
                        <p>Since Oſwego had been taken, the French remained en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely maſters of all the lakes, and we could do nothing to obſtruct their collecting the Indians from all parts, and obliging them to act in their favour. But our apprehenſions, (or what ſhall they be called?) did more in favour of the French than their conqueſts. Not ſatified with the loſs of that important fortreſs, we ourſelves abandoned to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the enemy all the country of the Five Nations, the only body of Indians who preſerved even the appearance of friendſhip to us. The forts we had at the Great carrying Place were demoliſhed; Wood Creek was induſtriouſly ſtopped up and filled with logs; by which it became evident to all thoſe who knew that country, that our communication with our allied Indians was totally cut off; and what was worſe, our whole frontier left perfectly uncovered to the irruption of the enemies ſavages, who ſoon availed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of our errors. For after the removal of theſe barriers, and the taking of Fort William Henry, of which we ſhall ſpeak preſently, they deſtroyed with fire and ſword the fine ſettlements which we poſſeſſed on the Mohawks river and on thoſe grounds called the German flats. Thus with a vaſt increaſe of our forces, and the cleareſt ſuperiority over the enemy, we only abandoned our allies, expoſed our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and relinquiſhed a large and valuable tract of country.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1261701201:60"/>
The French ſoon made us feel effectually the want of what we had loſt, and what we had thrown away.</p>
                        <p>A conſiderable fort called Fort William-Henry, had been built on the ſouthern edge of the Lake George, in order to command that lake, and to cover our frontiers; a garriſon of 2500 men defended it. General Webb with about 4000 men was poſted at no great diſtance. No ſooner had the French learned that my Lord Loudoun with the body of the army was gone on the Louiſbourg expedition, than they prepared to take advantage of his abſence. They drew toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the forces which they had at Crown-Point, Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga, and the adjacent poſts; they added a conſiderable body of Canadians, and a greater number of Indians than they had ever yet employed; the whole made near 8000 men. With theſe and a very good artillery, Monſieur Montcalm prepared to beſiege Fort William-Henry. It is ſaid that the advances of this commander were not made with ſo much ſecreſy as to prevent General Webb from having early intelligence of his motions; but unfortunately no credit being given to this intelligence, orders were not ſent to collect the militia in ſufficient time, which in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with his own forces, and with thoſe in the fort had either obliged the French to relinquiſh their attempt, or to have made it a very great hazard. But the ſiege being now regularly formed, and the beſiegers meeting but little oppoſition from within,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 3."/> 

 and no diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance at all from without, the place was in ſix days ſurrendered by the advice of General Webb;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9th."/> 

 whoſe intercepted letter M. Montcalm ſent into the fort.</p>
                        <p>The garriſon marched out with their arms, and engaged not to ſerve during eighteen months. The French ſavages paid no regard to the capitulation, but falling upon our men as they marched out, dragged away the little effects they had left, hawling the Indians and Blacks in our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice out of their ranks, ſcalping ſome, carrying off others, and committing a thouſand outrages and barbarities, from which the French commander endeavoured in vain to reſtrain them. All this was ſuffered by 2000 men with arms in their hands, from a diſorderly crew of ſavages. However, the greateſt part of our men, though in a bad condition, got to Fort Edward, ſome by flight; ſome having ſurrendered themſelves to the French, were by
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1261701201:61"/>
them ſent home. The enemy demoliſhed the fort, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off the proviſion, ammunition, artillery, and the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels which we had prepared on the lake, and departed without attempting any thing farther. Neither was any thing farther attempted on our ſide. And thus was finiſhed the third campaign in North America, where we had actually near 20,000 regular troops, a great number of provincial forces, and a great naval power of upwards of twenty ſhips of the line.</p>
                        <p>A war between the maritime powers is felt in all parts of the world. Not content with inflaming Europe and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and diſſentions of the French and Engliſh purſued the tracts of their commerce, and the Genges felt the fatal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a quarrel on the Ohio. But here the ſcene is changed greatly to the advantage of our nation; the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Admiral Watſon and Colonel Clive, re-eſtabliſhed the military honour of the Engliſh, which was ſinking there as it had done in all other places. Admiral Watſon with no more than three ſhips of the line, ſailed from Madraſs, and afer a tedious voyage arrived at the port of Balaſore in the kingdom of Bengal,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Dec. 5."/> 

 where ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening his force with what recruits he could draw together, he entered the Ganges, and after a ſhort reſiſtance made himſelf maſter of Buſbudgia fort which commanded that part of the river.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Jan. 30."/> 

 This opened him a paſſage to the fort of Calcutta, the late prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſettlement of the company in Bengal, and the ſcene of the deplorable ſufferings of ſo many of our unfortunate countrymen. Animated with revenge at the affecting ſight of this place, our ſhips and land forces attacked it with ſo much ſpirits, that the Indians ſurrendered it on the ſame day it was approached. A few days after Hugly, ſituated higher up the Ganges, was reduced with as little difficulty.</p>
                        <p>The Nabob, who ſaw that the torrent of the Engliſh va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour could not be reſiſted by ſuch feeble dams as forts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by Indians, drew down a whole army conſiſting of 10,000 horſe, and 12,000 foot, to drive them from their conqueſts, Infinitely inferior as our troops were in number, they did not heſitate to attack the Nabob's army. Though our forces did not entirely rout the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Feb. 5."/> 

 yet they made a great ſlaughter amongſt them; and they had ſo much the advantage of the field, that the Nabob was in a ſhort time glad to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a treaty of peace,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9th."/> 

 by which the Engliſh
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1261701201:62"/>
Eaſt-India company was re-eſtabliſhed in all its antient pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges; an immunity from all taxes was granted, and a reſtitution promiſed for all that the trade had ſuffered in the taking of Calcutta.</p>
                        <p>When all obſtruction on the ſide of the Indians was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the company's officers had taken poſſeſſion of their antient eſtabliſhments, the Admiral turned his arms againſt the French. He reſolved to attack Chandenagore, ſituated ſomewhat higher on the river than Calcutta; a place of conſiderable ſtrength and the principal ſettlement of the French in that part of the Eaſt-Indies. In this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition Colonel Clive commanded 700 Europeans and 1600 Black ſoldiers. The Admirals Watſon and Pocock com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the fleet, if it may be called a fleet, which conſiſted of no more than three ſhips of the line, the Kent, the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the Saliſbury. The French prepared in the beſt manner they could to receive them, and ſunk ſeveral large veſſels both above and below their fort; but the Admiral having by carefully ſounding found a ſafe paſſage without being driven to the neceſſity of weighing up any of the ſhips, made ſo ſevere a fire upon the fort, in which he was ſeconded by Colonel Clive's batteries on the ſhore, that the place capitulated in leſs than three hours.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="May 24."/> 

 500 Europeans and 700 Blacks ſurrendered priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of war; 183 pieces of cannon were found in the place, beſides a conſiderable value in goods and money. Four forts coſt our troops no more than four days to reduce them.</p>
                        <p>The judicious timeing of theſe ſeveral operations, as well as thoſe which followed, was not leſs laudable than the gallant ſpirit with which they were executed. Before the French were alarmed, cure was taken to re-poſſeſs all the poſts we formerly held; to humble the Nabob by ſome ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual blow; and by a treaty tie up his hands from acting againſt us. This Prince had ſhewed himſelf from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſigning that treaty, very little inclined to abide by the ſtipulations he had made. He indeed promiſed abundantly, but always deferred the performance upon ſuch frivolous pretences, as evidently demonſtrated his ill inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Engliſh commanders underſtood this proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly well; but they reſolved to diſſemble their ſenſe of it, until they had broken the French power in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, which they had greater reaſon to dread, ſmall as it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1261701201:63"/>
was, than all the armies of the Nabob. When they had fully accompliſhed this by the taking of Chandenagore, they deliberated whether they ought not to re-commence hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the Indians. A reſolution in the affirmative had been attended with great difficulty and danger, if a moſt fortunate incident had not helped to enſure ſucceſs.</p>

His Generals were moſtly diſcontented, and ſome of them entered into a conſpiracy againſt him. Jaffier Ali Cawn one of his principal officers, a man of great power and intereſt, was at the head of this conſpiracy. As ſoon as their deſigns were ripened, they communicated them to the Engliſh government in Calcutta, praying their aſſiſtance. The chiefs there did not heſitate long what party they ſhould take; they entered into a treaty with Jeffier Ali Cawn and the conſpirators; and in conſequence of this treaty, our troops immediately took the field uner Colonel Clive. The Admiral undertook to garriſon the fort of Chandenagore with his ſeamen, in order to leave the greater number of land forces for the expedition. A detachmnnt of fifty ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with their officers were added to ſerve as gunners. A twenty gun ſhip was ſtationed above Hugly, in order to preſerve a communication between Colonel Clive and the Admiral.</p>
                        <p>Their preliminary meaſures being thus judiciouſly taken, they advanced up the river, and in a few days brought the Nabob's army of about 20,000 men excluſive of thoſe who favoured the conſpirators, to an action, which was deciſive in favour of the Engliſh.

 Two conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bodies commanded by Jaffier and Roy Dolub remained inactive in the engagement.

by the conqueror. In about thirteen days this great revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was accompliſhed; and with leſs force and trouble than is often required to take a petty village in Germany, was transferred the government of a vaſt kingdom, yielding in its dimenſions to few in Europe, but to none in the ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of its ſoil, the number of its inhabitants, and the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its commerce. By the alliance with the new Nabob, and by the reduction of Chandenagore, the French were entirely driven out of Bengal and all its dependencies. This was one of the articles of the treaty. By the other articles, a perpetual alliance offenſive and defenſive was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the parties. The territories of the company were enlarged, and upwards of two millions ſterling was ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to be paid as an indemnification to the Eaſt-India com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and the ſufferers in the taking of Calcutta. The new Nabob, full of gratitude to thoſe to whom he owed his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, gave, beſides the above large ſums, about 600,0000 pounds, as a gratuity to the ſea ſquadron and the troops. However ſhort of expectation our enterpriſes in America fell this year, thoſe in the Eaſt-Indies greatly exceeded every thing we could hope from the forces which were employed. And it may be doubted whether all the great powers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the preſent bloody wars in Europe, in which ſuch torrents of blood were ſpilled, and ſo many millions of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure are waſted, will in the concluſion reap amongſt them ſo much ſolid profit as the Engliſh Eaſt-India company did with a handful of men in a ſhort campaign.

overtures towards peace from any of the powers at war. And perhaps nothing ſo ſingular ever happened, as that ſo many ſtates, united, if not againſt their real intereſts, yet againſt all their former habits of connection, full of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſions of jealouſy, abounding with matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt each other, and even involved in misfortunes which uſually deſtroy a mutual confidence, that not one of theſe powers either from fear, or hope, or wearineſs, or levity, deſiſted from their hoſtilities againſt the King of Pruſſia; nor did that monarch acquire one ally more by the admiration of his ſucceſſes, than he had formerly gained through compaſſion to his misfortunes. All the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates preſerved the ſame attachment to each other, to him the ſame animoſity. It is equally a matter of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, how the reſources even of theſe great ſtates, could keep pace with their ambition, and in a very few months ſupply the place of great armies almoſt wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. The King of Pruſſia by his victories had added to his natural reſources. Theſe reſources were more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than is commonly imagined; and the poſſeſſion of Saxony which yielded him great ſupplies, ſaved his own revenue. He was indeed not quite ſo freſh as at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the war; but then the condition of the enemy was in many reſpects far worſe than his. His troops had beſides acquired a high reputation and a clear ſuperiority over all others. The conſideration, however, of an army greatly harraſſed, and a moſt ſevere winter, obliged him to reſtrain his ardor, and to attempt nothing againſt the Auſtrians in the months of January, February and March. The ſame inaction owing to much the ſame cauſes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed amongſt the Hanoverians for a little time: but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been reinforced about the middle of February by a body of Pruſſian horſe, they put their whole army once more in motion.</p>

the French from poſt to poſt. They abliged them to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate Otterſberg, Bremen and Werden. The caſtle of Rotterberg was taken in ſix hours. A conſiderable detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under Count Chabot was poſted at Hoya, a ſtrong fort upon the Weſer, and a place of ſuch conſequence that prince Ferdinand reſolved to diſlodge the enemy from it. He appointed for that ſervice the hereditary Prince of Brunſwick, with four batalions of foot and ſome light horſe. This Prince, not twenty year of age, had already entered into the courſe of glory under the auſpices of his uncle, and full of ardor to ſignalize himſelf, with joy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the occaſion; and here he gave an earneſt of his fame, in one of the moſt lively and beſt conducted actions in the war. The firſt fruits of this young hero were ſuch as would have done honour to the maturity of the moſt experienced ſoldier.</p>
                        <p>The Prince had a broad and deep river to paſs. He had no means of tranſporting his men, but a ſingle float;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Feb. 23."/> 

 ſo that a long time muſt be ſpent in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them over: what was worſt, before half his troops were paſſed, a ſtrong wind aroſe, which rendered the float unſerviceable, and entirely cut off all communication between the Prince and the moſt conſiderable number of his party, whilſt the party he was going to attack was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to him, had his whole body been together. In this exigence the Prince came to a reſolution worthy of himſelf. He reſolved not to ſpend any time in attempts to bring over the reſt of his troops, much leſs to make any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to return to them; but to urge on boldly, in ſuch a manner as to poſſeſs the enemy with an opinion of his ſtrength, and to attack them briſkly before they could be undeceived. Therefore, between four and five o'clock in the morning, they marched with the utmoſt ſpeed directly to the town of Hoya. When they had approached within a mile and a half of the place, another accident was on the point of defeating the whole enterpriſe. Their detachment fired by miſtake upon four of the enemies dragoons, who were patrolling; the firing was caught from one to another, and at laſt became general. This ſeemed more than enough to diſcover their motions and alarm the enemy. But the ſame ſpirit influenced the conduct of every part of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; a bold countenance became neceſſary, and it was aſſumed; they marched with the utmoſt diligence to the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1261701201:69"/>
town, and encountered the enemy at the bridge; a fierce fire, well ſupported on either ſide, enſued. The ground was ſuch, that the Prince could not bring up his whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatchment equally. Senſible of this diſadvantage, he form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a deſign to overcome it, as judicious, as it was reſolute, which was to turn the enemy by attacking them in the rear; to execute this deſign, it was neceſſary to make a circuit about the town. Every thing ſucceeded: The attack on the enemy's rear was made with bayonnets fixed, a terrible ſlaughter enſued. The French abondoned the bridge, and fled in confuſion: The Prince having cleared the town of the enemy, joined the party he had left. The Count de Chabot threw himſelf, with two batallions into the caſtle, with a reſolution to maintain himſelf there; but in a little time he capitulated, ſurrendering the place, his ſtores, and magazines, his troops being permitted to march out. The Prince, who had no artillery, and who, on account of the badneſs of the roads, deſpaired of bringing up heavy cannon, ſuffered them to depart. Six hundred and ſeventy men were made priſoners in the action, and a place of much importance, and which opened a paſſage over the Weſer, ſecured to the Hanoverians, with the loſs of leſs than 1000 men killed and wounded. I have dwelt on this action, and deſcribed it as particularly as I could, though nothing deciſive in itſelf, becauſe it is not in pitched battles between great armies, where the moſt maſterly ſtrokes of conduct are always diſplayed; theſe leſſer affairs frequently call for as much or more of ſagacity, reſolution, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of mind, in the commander; yet are they often ſlighly paſſed by, as matters of no conſequence, by the generality of people, who rather conſider the greatneſs of the event, than the ſpirit of the action.</p>
                        <p>Prince Ferdinand continued to advance, with his right on one ſide of the Weſer, and his left on the other; the French continued to retire, and ſucceſſively abandoned all the places they had occupied in the electorate, except Minden. A garriſon of 4000 men defended that place; but it was cloſely inveſted, and in nine days the whole garriſon ſurrendered priſoners of war.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="March 14."/> 

 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſkirmiſhes happened between the advanced parties of the Hanoverian army and the French, always to the advantage of the former. The wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the French troops is hardly to be deſcribed or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1261701201:70"/>
officers and ſoldiers involved in one common diſtreſs; the officers forgot their rank, and the ſoldiers their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; full hoſpitals, and empty magazines; a rigorous ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and bad covering; their baggage ſeized or abandoned, and the huſſars and hunters of the allied army continually haraſſing, pillaging, and cutting them off. It was no alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation to their miſery, that the inhabitants of the country, which they abandoned, were reduced to the ſame extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The ſavage behaviour of ſome of their troops at their departure, took away all compaſſion for their ſufferings; but this was not univerſal. The Duke de Randan, who commanded in Hanover, quitted the place with the ſame virtue, that he had ſo long held it. Reſentment had no power to perſwade him to act with rigour, in the adverſe turn of the French affairs, than the pride of conqueſt had in their proſperity. When he had orders to evacuate the place, there were very conſiderable magazines of corn and forage, amaſſed for the uſe of the army; he had full time to burn them, and he had precedents enough to have juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the action: but he left the whole in the hands of the magiſtrates, to be gratuitouſly diſtributed to the poor: he employed all his vigilance to prevent the leaſt diſorder amongſt his troops, and was himſelf the laſt man that marched out of the town. This behaviour, which did ſuch honour to his name and country, has made his memory for ever dear to the Hanoverians, drew tears of love and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude from his enemies, and acknowledgments from the generous Prince againſt whom he ſerved.</p>
                        <p>The French, through extreme difficulties, marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Rhine in three columns. The ſeveral ſcattered bodies, which had united at Munſter, formed the right. The body, which came from Paderborn; and which was commanded by the prince of Clermont in perſon, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the middle. The forces which had occupied Heſſe were on the left. In this order they reached the Rhine, which they all paſſed, except a body under Count Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, who ſtill remained at Weſel, and reſolved to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that poſt. The French army, which about four months before had paſſed the Rhine in numbers, and in a condition to make the moſt powerful enemies tremble, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any adverſe ſtroke of war whatſoever, by a fate almoſt unparalleled, now repaſſed it like fugitives, in a condition the moſt deplorable, reduced to leſs than half their original
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1261701201:71"/>
number, and cloſely purſued by the enemy, which they had obliged to lay down their arms.</p>
                        <p>The ſame ill fortune, and the ſame deſpair of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs followed them every where. On the arrival of a ſmall Engliſh ſquadron, commanded by commodore Holmes before Embden, and their taking an advantageous ſituation,

 which cut off the communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the town and the mouth of the river Ems; the French garriſon,

 conſiſting of 4000 men, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately evacuated the place. As ſoon as Mr. Holmes diſcovered their deſign, and that they were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting their artillery and baggage up the river, he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out a few armed boats to purſue them. Theſe took ſome of the enemy's veſſels, in which were the ſon of an officer of diſtinction, and a conſiderable ſum of money. The commodore without delay reſtored the ſon to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and offered to return the money, on receiving the officer's word of honour, that it was his private property. This affair is mentioned, not only to do juſtice to the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious conduct by which a place of ſo much conſideration was ſo eaſily carried, but alſo to that generoſity of ſpirit, which ſo nobly diſtinguiſhes almoſt all thoſe, who hold any rank in our ſervice.</p>

                        <p>WHILST the French arms ſuffered ſuch diſgraces abroad, they endeavoured by an alteration of their councils at home, to reſtore their credit. Their miniſters had been long the ſport of female caprice; it was their power of pleaſing a miſtreſs who governed their King, that alone qualified them to ſerve their country. Some of the moſt able men were turned out of their employments with diſgrace; others retired from the publick ſervice with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation; a certain low character had for a long time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1261701201:72"/>
in all the proceedings of France, both within and without. Even in their domeſtic diſputes, and where ſomething of a free and manly ſpirit appeared, this ſpirit evaporated, and ſpent itſelf upon unworthy and deſpicable objects. Theſe conteſts which involved the church, the law and the crown, weakened them all; and the ſtate felt all the ill effects of diſunion of its orders, without ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an augmentation of power thrown into the ſcale of any. But now taught by their misfortunes and diſgraces, they were obliged to an alteration in their conduct: they were obliged to call men to the public ſervice upon public prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: at a time indeed, when in many reſpects things could only be altered, not mended: and wiſe and able mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters could do little more by their penetration and public ſpirit, than to ſee and lament the ruin, cauſed by the want of thoſe virtues in their predeceſſors. The duke de Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſle, known to all Europe for his great abilities, and his great exploits, was at length placed at the head of the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary department, as ſecretary at war.</p>
                        <p>There appeared in the common prints a ſpeech, ſaid to be made by that nobleman in council; which, if it be not authentic, contains at leaſt ſuch ſentiments, as would come not unnaturally from a French patriot, and one who had ſerved his King and country with honour during better times.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>I know, ſaid he, the ſtate of our armies. It gives me great grief, and no leſs indignation: for beſides the real evil of the diſorder in itſelf, the diſgrace and infamy which it reflects on our government, and on the whole nation, is ſtill more to be apprehended. The choice of officers ought to be made with mature deliberation. I know but too well to what length the want of diſcipline, pillaging and robbing have been carried on by the officers and common men, after the example ſet them by their generals. It mortifies me to think I am a Frenchman; my principals are known to be very different from thoſe which are now followed. I had the ſatisfaction to retain the eſteem, the friendſhip and the conſideration, of all the princes, noblemen, and even all the common people in all parts of Germany where I commanded the king's forces. They lived there in the midſt of abundance; every one was pleaſed; it fills my ſoul with anguiſh, to find that at preſent the French are held in execration;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1261701201:73"/>
that every body is diſpirited, and that many officers pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly ſay things that are criminal and highly puniſhable. The evil is ſo great that it demands immediate redreſs. I can eaſily judge, by what paſſes in my own breaſt, of what our generals feel from the ſpeeches they muſt daily hear in Germany, concerning our conduct; which indeed would loſe much to be compared with that of our allies. I muſt particularly complain of the delays and irregularity of the poſts; a ſervice which is very ill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for. I am likewiſe diſpleaſed with the negligence of our generals returning anſwers; which is a manifeſt breach of their duty. Had I commanded the army, a thouſand things which are done, would not have been done; and others, which are neglected, would have been executed. I would have multiplied my communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; I would have had ſtrong poſts on the right, on the left, and in the centre lined with troops. I would have had magazines in every place. The quiet and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the country ſhould have been equal to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſaffection, at being harraſſed and plundered; and we ſhould have been as much beloved, as we are at preſent abhorred. The conſequences are too apparent to need being mentioned. I muſt inſiſt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> theſe things, becauſe late redreſs is better than the continuation of the evil.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>M. de Belleiſle being eſtabliſhed in his office, turned all his attention to the cure of the evils, which he lamented; and exerted all the power that remained in the nation, to put their army in Germany once more upon a reſpectable footing. The expedition into Germany was originally a meaſure as contrary to the true intereſts of France, as it was of juſtice and equity; but having adopted that meaſure, the conſequences which aroſe ſeemed to demand that it ſhould be purſued with vigour. Therefore the connection with the Empreſs Queen was drawn cloſer than ever, and nothing was omitted to give a greater ſtrength, and a better order to the army on the Rhine. But theſe endeavours which ſtrained all the ſinews of France, already too much weakened by the almoſt total ruin of ſeveral eſſential bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of their trade, drew away all the reſources neceſſary to ſupport their navy. It was then in a ſufficiently bad condition, from a want of ſeamen and ſtores; and there were no means found, or little attention uſed, to reſtore it: ſo that from a deficiency in the marine, it ſeemed to be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1261701201:74"/>
equally impracticable to feed the war in America, or to preſerve the coaſt of France itſelf from inſults. Such was the condition of our enemies, at the opening of the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign of 1758.</p>
                        <p>As to England, far from being exhauſted by the war, or diſpirited by our ill ſucceſs, our hopes roſe from our diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, and our reſources ſeemed to be augmented by our expences; with ſuch eaſe and alacrity were the neceſſary ſupplies granted and raiſed. Many errors and many abuſes which the war diſcovered without making fatal, were corrected. The ſpirit of our officers was revived by fear or by ſhame. Our trade was well protected by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, and prudent diſtribution of our naval force. The revenue was frugally managed, and the whole ſtate well cemented and bound together in all its parts, by the union of the adminiſtration, by the patriotiſm which ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated it, and by the entire confidence which the people had in the preſiding abilities and intentions. As France perſiſted in her attachment to the enemies of his Pruſſian majeſty, Great Britain entered into ſtill cloſer engagements with that monarch, the luſtre of whoſe virtues, ſet off by his late wonderful ſucceſſes, quite turned our eyes from the objections which were raiſed againſt the conſiſtency of that alliance with our intereſts. How far it is conſiſtent with them, is I think, a much more difficult point to ſettle, than the adherents to either party ſeem willing to allow. But it ought to be conſidered, that the circumſtances of affairs in the beginning of the war, hardly admitted of any other choice; it had been the height of madneſs, to have been on ill terms with his Pruſſian majeſty at that time; and it was impoſſible to have kept good terms with him, without being on very bad ones with Vienna. Things were in an ill ſituation; and the ballance of Germany was in danger of being overſet, what party ſoever ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. It was impoſſible that England could have ſtood neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this conteſt: if ſhe had, France would not have imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated her moderation; ſhe would gladly have joined with the King of Pruſſia to diſtreſs Hanover, and reduce Auſtria. Theſe two powers ſo exerted, would doubtleſs compaſs their end, unleſs we interpoſed to prevent it; and we muſt ſooner or later have interpoſed, unleſs we were reſolved tamely to ſee France and her allies giving laws to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. In a word, France would certainly have joined with
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1261701201:75"/>
one party or the other, and the party which ſhe joined, would certainly, by that union, prove dangerous to the common liberty, and muſt therefore be oppoſed by us; we muſt have been in ſpite of us engaged in the troubles of Germany, as we ever have been, and ever ſhall be, as long as we are a people of conſideration in Europe. The alliance with Pruſſia was pointed out to us by the circumſtance of his acting on the defenſive. The King of Pruſſia medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no conqueſts. But her imperial majeſty indiſputably aimed at the recovery of Sileſia, which was to diſturb the ſettled order of things; and this deſign was the only cauſe of the troubles in that part of the world. I am ſenſible that this is notwithſtanding all that may be ſaid, a queſtion of ſome intricacy, and requires a conſideration of many more particulars, than the brevity of our deſign will allow. But whether we choſe our party in this alliance judiciouſly or not, we have, I imagine, very great reaſon to be pleaſed with a meaſure, which has induced France to engage ſo deeply in the affairs of Germany, at ſo ruinous an expence of her blood and treaſure. Our miniſtry was at this time fully convinced of the prudence of the choice that had been made, and reſolved to ſupport his Pruſſian majeſty, and the army under Prince Ferdinand, in the moſt effectual manner; 100,000 l. were voted for the Hanoverian and Heſſian forces; and a convention between the King of Pruſſia,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Ap. 11."/> 

 and his Britannic majeſty, was ſigned in London, whereby the King of Great Britain engages to pay his Pruſſian majeſty the ſum of 670,000 l. ſterling; and each of the contracting powers engaged to conclude no peace without the participitation of the other.</p>
                        <p>The northern courts made no alteration in their ſyſtem. In Sweden, ſome real plots to diſturb the eſtabliſhed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ended in the ruin of their contrivers; ſome ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious plots were ſet on foot to give a ſanction to meaſures againſt the crown party, which anſwered their ends; and, as the ruling power continued the ſame and the internal diſſenſions the ſame, the hoſtilities againſt the King of Pruſſia were reſolved with the former animoſity, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be purſued with the former languor. In Ruſſia, the Empreſs did not think her intentions well ſeconded by her miniſters. The great delays, and the unaccountable retreat in the laſt campaign, gave ground to ſuſpect, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1261701201:76"/>
ſhe had been betrayed by her miniſters, or her generals. M. Apraxin was moved from the command, and was put under arreſt. He juſtified his conduct by expreſs orders from Count Beſtuchef. Beſtuchef was removed from his office, and put under arreſt alſo. Count Woronzoff ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Beſtuchef in his employment, and the generals Brown and Fermor took the command of the army in the place of Apraxin.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as the ſeason permitted the King of Pruſſia to re-commence his operations, he laid ſiege to Schweidnitz, and puſhed it with ſo much vigour,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="April 3."/> 

 that the place ſurrendered in thirteen days. The garriſon reduced by ſickneſs during the blockade, and by their loſſes during the ſiege, from ſeven to little more than three thouſand men, yielded themſelves priſoners of war. By this ſtroke, the King of Pruſſia left his enemies no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any part of his dominions. His next conſideration was how to guard againſt their future attempts, and at the ſame time to make a vigorous attack upon ſome part of the Auſtrian territories. His forces were well ſtationed for both theſe purpoſes; for beſides the troops which Count Dohna commanded on the ſide of Pomerania, a conſiderable body was poſted between Wohlau and Glogau, in order to cover Sileſia from the fury of the Ruſſians, in caſe they ſhould make their inroad that way. An army, in a little time after was formed in Saxony, commanded by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince Henry, which conſiſted of thirty battalions, and forty-five ſquadrons. It was deſtined to make head againſt the army of the Empire, which by amazing efforts made during the winter, and by the junction of a large body of Auſtrians, was now in a condition to act again. A ready communication was kept up between all the King of Pruſſia's armies, by a proper choice of poſts.</p>
                        <p>The King reſolved to make Moravia the theatre of the war this year. Moravia was freſh ground; a country, as yet untouched by the ravages of war. If he ſhould ſucceed in his operations in this country, his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes by opening to him the neareſt road to Vienna, muſt prove more deciſive than they could any where elſe. If he ſhould fail, the Auſtrians were at a diſtance from the centre of his affairs, and would find it difficult to improve their advantages to his ruin. After the reduction of Schweid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitz, the King ordered two bodies of his troops to poſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1261701201:77"/>
themſelves in ſuch a manner, as to make it appear that he intended to carry the war into Bohemia. Whilſt he drew away the enemies attention from the real objects by theſe diſpoſitions, the main of his army by a very rapid march,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="May 3."/> 

 entered into Moravia in two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, and made themſelves Maſters, in a ſhort time and with little or no oppoſition, of all the poſts ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to cover the troops to be employed in the ſiege of Olmutz. On the 27th of May the trenches were opened before that city.</p>
                        <p>M. Daun was no ſooner appriſed of the King's march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Moravia, than he took his route through Bohemia to that province. Notwithſtanding that the Empreſs Queen omitted no poſſible endeavours to aſſemble a large army againſt the King of Pruſſia, though ſhe had for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe exhauſted the Milaneſe and Tuſcany, and ſwept up the laſt recruits in her Danubian territories, M. Daun was not yet in a condition to give the King of Pruſſia battle; neither did his character lead him to truſt that to fortune, which he might enſure, though more ſlowly, by conduct. This wiſe general took his poſts from Gewics to Littau, in a mountainous country, in a ſituation where it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to attack him. He had the fertile country of Bohemia, from whence he readily and certainly drew ſupplies, at his rear. He was from his poſition at the ſame time enabled to haraſs the Pruſſian army before Olmutz, and to intercept the convoys which were brought to them from Sileſia.</p>
                        <p>Olmutz, by the extent of its works, and other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous circumſtances, is a city which it is very difficult compleatly to inveſt. So that ſome of the King's poſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſarily weakened by occupying ſo great an extent of country, were attacked by Daun's detachments from time to time, with ſuch ſucceſs, that abundant ſuccours both of men and ammunition were thrown into the place. Theſe attacks were always made by night, and very few nights paſſed without ſome attack. The ſucceſs was various. But the operations of the ſiege were greatly diſturbed by theſe continual alarms. Beſides it is ſaid that the Auſtrians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King's invaſion of this province, had deſtroyed all the forage in the neighbourhood of Olmutz. The horſe were obliged to forage at a great diſtance, which harraſſed them extreamly. M. Daun took advantage of all theſe circumſtances. It was in vain that the King of Pruſſia
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1261701201:78"/>
endeavoured by all the arts of a great commander to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke or entice him to an engagement. He profited of the advantages he had made, without being tempted by them to throw out of his hands the ſecure game he was play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>The great object of M. Daun was the Pruſſian convoys. On receiving advice that a large and important one was to leave Troppau on the 25th of June, he took meaſures to intercept it. He ordered general Jahnus, who was at Muglitz on the left, to advance towards Bahrn, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment which was at Prerau at a conſiderable diſtance to the right, to march to Stadt-Leibe; ſo that theſe two corps ſhould on different ſides attack the convoy at one and the ſame time. To further the execution of this project, M. Daun himſelf approached the Pruſſian army, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected all his motions as if he intended to give them battle. However, the King was too great a maſter in the game of generalſhip, which was now playing, to be deceived by this feint. He detached a conſiderable party under general Ziethen, to ſupport his convoy, which was already about 7000 ſtrong. Before this detachment could come up, the convoy was attacked, but the Auſtrians were repulſed. But M. Daun, who provided for every thing, quickly reinforced his parties who renewed the engagement the next day. They firſt ſuffered the head of the convoy to go unmoleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but as the centre was ſtill embarraſſed in a dangerous defile, they eaſily cut off the head from the reſt, and then they attacked the centre with the greateſt fury. The Pruſſians made as good a reſiſtance as the nature of the ground would ſuffer. General Ziethen did every thing which could be expected from an accompliſhed officer; but in the end they were entirely routed; all the waggons in that diviſion were taken; the rear was puſhed back towards Troppau; the head alone with great difficulty arrived at the Pruſſian camp.</p>
                        <p>This was a fatal ſtroke, becauſe it came at a time when it was impoſſible to repair it. The ſiege of Olmutz had been all along attended with great difficulties: and now the news which every day arrived of the nearer and nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Ruſſians, called the King loudly to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his own dominions. Already the Coſſacks and Calmucks made incurſions into Sileſia, and by their ravages and cruelties, announced the approach of the great army.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1261701201:79"/>
The ſiege muſt be raiſed: Moravia muſt be abandoned; Marſhal Daun muſt have the Honour of freeing his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and driving away ſuch an Adverſary as the King of Pruſſia, from a conqueſt deemed certain; all was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without a battle, by a ſeries of the moſt refined and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous manoeuvres that ever were put in practice.</p>
                        <p>When the King of Pruſſia ſaw that the unproſperous ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his affairs obliged him to retreat; he took a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch as a victory inſpires in other. He took ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage even of the excellent movement of M. Daun, by which that able general had advanced his quarters to Poz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitz, and placed himſelf ſo as to ſupport Olmutz in the moſt effectual manner; by this movement, however, he was obliged to uncover the frontiers of Bohemia. The King of Pruſſia, whom nothing could eſcape, was ſenſible of this advantage, and therefore, inſtead of falling back upon Sileſia, which ſtep would immediately have drawn the Auſtrian army into his dominions, he determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from one part of the enemies territories into another. The day before the ſiege was raiſed the firing of the Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians continued as briſk as ever, and ſhewed no ſort of ſign of an intention to depart; but in the night the whole army took the road to Bohemia in two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 1."/> 

 and gained an entire march upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrians. So that notwithſtanding the utmoſt efforts which the enemy could make to overtake and haraſs the King upon his march, he advanced into Bohemia with little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation, ſeized upon a large magazine at Leutomiſſel, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated ſome corps of Auſtrians who had attempted to diſturb him in his progreſs, and arrived at Konigſgratz, one of the moſt important poſts in Bohemia, with all his ſick and wounded, with all his heavy baggage, all his heavy Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, and military ſtores complete. This place he poſſeſſed after driving from it a body of 7000 Auſtrians who were entrenched there. He immediately laid this city and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other diſtricts under contribution; but his plan not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any further operations on that ſide, he took no other advantage from this momentous poſt. He ſoon re-entered Sileſia, and marched with the moſt amazing dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to encounter the Ruſſians, who had at this time united their divided corps under Brown and Fermor, and fixed the long fluctuating plan of their operations, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the New Marche of Brandenburgh, and laying ſiege

                        <p>PRINCE Ferdinand had it not in his power to cut off the retreat of the French over the Rhine; but he preſſed them cloſely, and prepared himſelf to croſs that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in purſuit of them. His deſign was to carry the war beyond the Maeſe, and thereby oblige the Prince de Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſe to abandon the enterprize he was preparing againſt Heſſe Caſſel. His Highneſs executed the paſſage of the Rhine at Herven with the corps immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately under his command;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 1."/> 

 then he ſent the bridge with which he ſerved himſelf ſo well up the river to Rees; the reſt of the troops paſſed there; the whole army were over before the 7th of June. The flattery of the laſt age ſaw with aſtoniſhment a paſſage of the Rhine by a French monarch, unoppoſed, at the head of a mighty army. We ſaw that river paſſed by the enemies of France, in the preſence of an army of 50,000 of that nation; it was an action which did not need the exaggerations of rhetoric.</p>
                        <p>The French army retired as the Prince advanced, and took an advantageous camp which threatened to retard the operations of the allies: their right was under Rheinberg; but the Prince by his well-judged motions turned their left flank towards the convent of Campe, by which the French found themſelves obliged to quit their advantageous poſt,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1261701201:81"/>
and to retire into Meurs: they ſtill kept towards the Rhine: the Prince advanced on the ſide of the Maeſe.</p>
                        <p>It was evident, that whilſt the French continued only to retire, it would prove impoſſible for them to hinder the allies from executing the plan they propoſed: they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it adviſeable to change their countenance. They had falled back as far as Nuys; they now returned on their ſteps, and advanced as far as Crevelt, within a few miles of Prince Ferdinand's camp. The Prince made the diſpoſitions for a battle, with his uſual vigour and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. He carefully reconnoitred the ſituation of the enemy. He found that their right was at a village called Viſchelon; their left extended towards Anrath, where it was covered with a wood: Crevelt, which was in the front of their right was occupied by a party of their troops. His highneſs reſolved upon three attacks: the firſt and real attack was on the flank of the enemy's left wing; the other two were deſigned to divert their attention, and prevent their ſuccouring the object of his principal attack; for which purpoſe he recommended to his generals to make the beſt uſe of their heavy artillery, and not to advance too far unleſs they were perfectly aſſured of the ſucceſs of the main operation.</p>
                        <p>Having made theſe wiſe diſpoſitions, and perfectly learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beſt routes by which the enemy might be approached,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 23."/> 

 his highneſs put himſelf at the head of the grenadiers of his right wing, and advanced on the ſide of Anrath in two colums. A canonading vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and well ſupported opened the action: the Hanove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian artillery was greatly ſuperior to that of the French; but though the French loſt many men, they loſt no ground in this way, and their poſition in the wood made a cloſe attack abſolutely neceſſary: the hereditary Prince of Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwick put himſelf at the head of the firſt line of foot, and with his uſual ſpirit, advanced with the whole front direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the wood. Here a furious fire of ſmall arms com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, which continued without the ſmalleſt intermiſſion for two hours and an half. All the Hanoverian battalions threw themſelves into the wood: two ditches well lined with infantry were oppoſed to their fury: they were forced one after another: the enemies battalions were puſhed back, they were entirely broken, and fled out of the wood in a diſorder which was irreparable: their cavalry, who
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1261701201:82"/>
kept the beſt countenance poſſible, in ſpite of the terrible fire of the Hanoverian artillery, and in ſpite of the vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <p>Seven thouſand of their beſt troops were killed, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and taken priſoners; but there was nothing in this battle ſo grievous to France, and ſo affecting even to the enemy, as the fate of the count de Giſors. This young nobleman, the only ſon of the duke de Belleiſle, not above twenty-five years of age, newly married to the heireſs of an illuſtrious houſe; himſelf the laſt hope of a moſt noble family, was mortally wounded at the head of his regiment, which be brought up with the moſt heroic courage, and inſpired by his example to make incredible efforts. He had been educated with all the care an excellent father could beſtow on a ſon of an uncommon genius, who was alone able to ſupport the reputation of his family. To the pureſt morals he had united the politeſt manners; he had made a great proficiency in learning; he knew many branches of it, and loved all; he had ſeen every part of Europe, and read courts and nations with a diſcerning eye; and wanted nothing to fulfil all hope, and to make him a perfect and laſting ornament and ſupport to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but a knowledge in the military art; he entered that courſe of glory and danger, and fell in his firſt campaign. The unhappy father and miniſter ſaw his private misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes keep pace with the public calamities, and the tears of his family mingled with thoſe of his country.</p>
                        <p>Prince Ferdinand gained a victory at Crevelt, which did the greateſt honour to his military capacity, and to the bravery of his troops. But it was a victory neither entire nor deciſive: the French army on their own frontiers was quickly and ſtrongly reinforced; ſo that they were not only in a condition in ſome ſort to make head againſt the allies, but were enabled to detach a conſiderable reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the army of the Prince de Soubiſe on the other ſide of the Rhine.</p>
                        <p>Altho' the Prince had reaſon to imagine that he ſhould not be able to keep his ground on this ſide of the Rhine for
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1261701201:83"/>
any conſiderable time, this did not hinder him from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving to the utmoſt, the advantage he had obtained. Whilſt the French, diſabled by their late defeat, were in no condition to oppoſe him, he paſſed the Rhine with a large detachment, and appeared on the 28th of June before Duſſeldorp, a city advantageouſly ſituated on the river, and belonging to the Elector Palatine. A ſevere bombardment obliged it to capitulate on the 7th of July: the garriſon, conſiſting of 2000 men, marched out with the honours of war. Prince Ferdinand placed here three battalions of Hanoverians, and threw a bridge of boats acroſs the river; by that means he multiplied his poſts and communications on both ſides of the Rhine; and threw a new and no ſmall impediment in the way of the French, to retard their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, in caſe he ſhould find himſelf compelled to retire. After this, the army of the allies and that of France, ſpent ſeveral days in making various marches and countermarches, as if they both propoſed to bring on an action, to which, however, it does not appear that either party was very ſtrongly inclined.</p>
                        <p>Prince Ferdinand ſtill retained his hopes that the Prince of Yſenburg who commanded the Heſſian troops, would find the Prince of Soubiſe employment for ſome time. He had originally laid his plan in ſuch a manner, that by paſſing the Maeſe, and transferring the ſeat of war into the enemies country, he might draw the French from the Rhine, and perhaps oblige the Prince of Soubiſe to come to the aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the main army under M. de Contades, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the room of count Clermont, being now the fourth commander of the French troops ſince they entered Germany. But whilſt Prince Ferdinand pleaſed himſelf with thoſe hopes, and ſtill continued to act as far as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would admit, in purſuance of this plan, he received an account which diſconcerted all his meaſures.</p>
                        <p>The duke de Broglio, ſupported by the corps of the prince de Soubiſe,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 23."/> 

 with a much ſuperior force, attacked and defeated the Heſſian army of ſeven thouſand men near Sangerſhauſen: this opened to them the poſſeſſion of the Weſer: they might act in Weſtphalia, on which ſide ſoever they pleaſed, and it was to be feared, that if they availed themſelves of the advantages they had, they might be able to intercept the Britiſh troops. Theſe troops having been landed at Embden, were now on their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1261701201:84"/>
march under the command of the duke of Marlborough to reinforce the allied army. The prince in this ſituation of affairs, had no option left but an engagement with the French army, or a retreat over the Rhine: the former was not eaſy to compaſs, as the French induſtriouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined a battle, and it became extremely dangerous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main long in a poſition with the enemies army on his left, and the ſtrong fortreſs of Gueldre on his right. In this ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation his ſubſiſtence became every day more difficult. To repaſs the Rhine had its difficulties too; the roads which led to that river were rendered almoſt impaſſable by the heavy rains; the river itſelf was ſo ſwelled with them, that the bridge at Rees had been for ſome time uſeleſs.</p>
                        <p>Theſe diſagreeable circumſtances of the allied army did not eſcape the penetration of Monſ. de Chevert, one of the ableſt commanders among the French. He formed a plan upon them, which, if it had ſucceeded, muſt have put the allies into the greateſt perplexity. This general had ſome time before paſſed the Rhine, with an intention of making himſelf maſter of Duſſeldorp, and he had prepared all things with great ability for that enterpriſe: the rains uſually heavy for that ſeaſon, and ſome other croſs accidents, had fruſtrated his intentions. But perceiving that the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents which defeated his deſign proved alſo unfavourable to the enemy, he reſolved to turn his diſappointment into an advantage, and from the ruins of his firſt project to build another of yet greater importance. Baron Imhoff was poſted to the right of the Rhine in a ſtrong ſituation near Meer. He was to cover the bridge at Rees; to ſecure a conſiderable magazine; and to keep open communication between the Engliſh reinforcements and the main army. The plan of Monſ. Chevert was to diſlodge Imhoff, to burn the bridge at Rees, to make himſelf maſter of the magazine, and to render the junction of the Engliſh troops with the Hanoverians impracticable. To execute this ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious ſcheme, he united ſeveral detachments from the garriſon of Weſel, to a conſiderable corps which he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have employed in the ſiege of Duſſeldorp. The whole made near 12,000 men: the troops under Imhoff were but ſix batallions, and four ſquadrons, hardly 3000 in all.</p>
                        <p>When that General was appriſed of the deſigns and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the French, he ſaw it was in vain to expect ſuccours
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1261701201:85"/>
from the army of Prince Ferdinand: the ſwell of the river had rendered all relief impoſſible; all his hopes were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his genius and the bravery of his troops. He conſidered that though the poſt he occupied was ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrong, the enemy might make themſelves maſters of Rees, by turning his camp, and thus execute one of the principal parts of their deſign; he conſidered the great difference between attacking and being attacked; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the effect of an attempt altogether unexpected by the enemy; he therefore took the reſolution of abandoning his poſt, and going out to meet them. Perceiving that the French were marching into difficult ground, he did not loſe a moment to begin the action. He ordered a ſmall party,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="April 5."/> 

 which he had poſted in a little coppice, to fall upon the enemies left, which he obſerved to be uncovered; and appointed the fire of this party, as a ſignal for all the reſt to advance, and make the onſet with bayonets fixed. The French thus vigorouſly and unexpectedly attacked, fell into confuſion; their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ill ſeconded the wiſdom of their general; they did not ſtand half an hour; they left on the field of battle eleven pieces of cannon, many priſoners, and much baggage to the Hanoverians, who drove them under the cannon of Weſel.</p>
                        <p>This ſignal advantage over ſuch a prodigious ſuperiority was not more gallantly obtained than well purſued and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. Imhoff ſaw that the rains had increaſed to ſuch a degree, as to leave no hopes for the allied army to paſs by the bridge of Rees. Having taken proper care of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines, he quitted his poſt at Meer, and being reinforced by ſome parties, who paſſed the river in boats, he marched with the utmoſt diligence towards the route of the Engliſh forces, and happily effected a junction, which had hitherto been attended with ſo many difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Prince Ferdinand in his retreat met with no obſtruction, but juſt what was ſufficient to diſplay more fully the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry of his officers, and the ſpirit of his troops. A town called Wachtendonck was on his left, as he retreated; this place, though not fortified, is a poſt of much importance, and being an inland ſurrounded by the river Niers, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult of acceſs: the French had thrown a body of troops into this place. The hereditary prince, the firſt in every active ſervice, was employed to force it. The
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1261701201:86"/>
bridge on his approach had been drawn up. The prince ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if he attempted to get down this bridge, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would gain time to recollect themſelves, threw himſelf into the river; his grenadiers, animated by ſo gallant an example, plunged in after him, and furiouſly attacking the enemy with their bayonets, in a few minutes drove them from that poſt; this advantage, joined to that gained by general Imhoff, and the uncommon reſolution which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in both theſe actions, awed the French. They found that their troops, raw, undiſciplined and little fit for hard ſervice, were not to be relied upon; and they feared to bring on an action, which by being deciſive againſt them might draw on the moſt fatal conſequences. So that the prince repaſſed the Rhine in a moſt excellent order, even with leſs trouble than he had at firſt paſſed it; and indeed with little moleſtation, but what he met with from the weather. Such exceſſive rains had fallen, that he in vain attempted a paſſage at Rhineberg or at his bridge of Rees;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 9. and 10."/> 

 he effected it a little lower at a place called Griethuyſen.</p>
                        <p>Although Prince Ferdinand was obliged to paſs the Rhine, and to act more upon the defenſive for the future; yet his vigorous conduct in the beginning was very glorious to him, and very advantageous to the common cauſe. The French ſuffered greatly in their military reputation; the Hanoverians had gained a ſuperiority over them, and now ſo much of the campaign was waſted, that notwithſtanding the greatneſs of their numbers, it was not probable that they would find themſelves able to make any conſiderable progreſs in their deſigns againſt the King's electoral domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions for this year. The advantage gained by Broglio and Soubiſe was not attended with the conſequences, which might have been apprehended. Prince Yſenburg kept ſo good a countenance in a ſtrong poſt he had choſen, that the French did not chooſe to attack him again; and ſince Prince Ferdinand had repaſſed the Rhine, he might always be well ſupported.</p>

                        <p>BY the retreat of the Pruſſians from Moravia, the war had aſſumed a new face. The Generals who conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it had changed hands. The King of Pruſſia was obliged to act upon the defenſive; M. Daun was now in a condition of diſplaying his talents in an offenſive war. The affairs of the King of Pruſſia were ſcarce ever in a more critical ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation than at that time. The Ruſſians ſeemed at firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to enter into Sileſia; but now they had united their ſeveral disjointed corps, penetrated into the New Marche of Brandenburgh, and having commenced the ſiege of Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin, a place that threatened them with no great oppoſition, they were arrived within a few days march of Berlin Count Dohna poſted with a greatly inferior force at Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort on the Oder, watched without being able to obſtruct their progreſs. In Pomerania, the Generals Weedel and Manteufel oppoſed almoſt the ſame ineffectual efforts to the arms of Sweden. The army of the Empire, and a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable body of Auſtrians under General Haddick, advanced into Saxony, and poſſeſſing themſelves by degrees of thoſe ſtrong poſts, which compoſe the frontiers of Miſnia, they continually ſtreightened the quarters of Prince Henry. That Prince was ſtrongly encamped at Dippolſwalde, with about 20,000 men, in order to cover Dreſden, and command the courſe of the Elbe. Thus circumſtanced, the King could not find his account in remaining long in Bohemia, where it was impoſſible to effect any thing deciſive. Every thing depended upon his being able to drive the Ruſſians out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>M.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1261701201:88"/>
time, which might be employed in the execution of more judicious projects. Beſides that in this manner of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he could never act in concert, nor preſerve any effectual communication with the ſeveral bodies of his allies. To puſh forward with his whole force directly to Berlin, could at beſt be regarded as a <hi>coup de main,</hi> which could prove nothing deciſive in the campaign, even ſuppoſing the project ſhould ſucceed, but it was rather probable that it would not ſucceed, as the King of Pruſſia might clear his hands of the Ruſſians before the army of M. Daun could, for want of ſubſiſtance arrive in the Lower Luſatia. Every conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration therefore pointed out the relief of Saxony as the great object of the Auſtrian operations. It was an object apparently to be compaſſed with greater eaſe, and if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, productive of more ſolid advantages than any other. The army of the Empire already ſuperior to that of Prince Henry could co-operate in the deſign, and the recovery of Saxony once effected, the King of Pruſſia would ſee himſelf entirely diveſted of one of the principal reſources he had to rely upon in the war, for money, proviſions, and forage; whilſt his hereditary dominions ſtripped of this ſtrong bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier defenceleſs in themſelves, and aſſaulted on three ſides by powerful armies, could ſcarce find them employment to the end of the campaign.</p>
                        <p>M. Daun having reſolved upon his plan of operations ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the King of Pruſſia to continue his march towards the Ruſſians, without any moleſtation: he contented himſelf with leaving a conſiderable body of Troops under the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals Harſch and de Ville, on the ſouthern frontiers of Sile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, in order to form ſome enterpriſe on that ſide, which might draw the attention and forces of the Pruſſians as far as poſſible from the great object of his operations. When he had made theſe diſpoſitions he marched towards Saxony, through the country of Luſatia, by Zittau, Gorlitz, and Bautzen. His firſt project was bold. He propoſed to croſs the Elbe at Meiſſen; by which the communication between Dreſden and Leipſic would be cut of at one ſtroke. Then he propoſed to attack Prince Henry in his camp at Seidlitz, whilſt the army of the Empire fell upon him in another quarter. Thus the Prince was to be put between two fires, and his retreat into Dreſden to be rendered impracticable; but upon mature conſideration, this project was laid aſide. M. Daun reflected that the fortreſs of Sonneſtein, of which he
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1261701201:89"/>
was not yet in poſſeſſion, would prove no ſmall impediment to his deſigns.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sept. 3."/> 

 He conſidered that the poſition of Prince Henry oppoſite to the army of the Empire was too advantageous, to make an attack upon him adviſeable: and unleſs the Prince could be induced to attack the Imperialiſts firſt, a point not to be expected in his circumſtances, he might always find it eaſy to throw himſelf into Dreſden, and by proper motions to preſerve a free communication with the King. M. Daun was obliged to renounce his firſt deſign, but he was left at full liberty to form and to execute ſuch other plans for the relief of Saxony as his prudence could ſuggeſt.</p>
                        <p>About that time the imperial court elated with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſucceſs, began to ſhew with what moderation they were likely to behave if it continued and increaſed. They entirely threw of all the little appearance of reſpect they had hitherto retained for the King of Great Britain, and ſeveral others of the moſt reſpectable Princes and perſons of the Empire. They made the abuſe of their authority go hand in hand with the ſucceſs of their arms. On the 21ſt of Auguſt a concluſum of the Aulic council was iſſued againſt the King of Great Britain, as Elector of Hanover, againſt the Landgrave of Heſſe Caſſel, againſt Prince Ferdinand of Brunſwick, the Count of Lippe Buckebourg, and in general againſt all the Adherence to the King of Pruſſia, threatening them with Penalties indignity, perſon and eſtate. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this decree, letters avocatory were iſſued, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying to the ſovereign Princes, that if they did not within a limited time diſperſe their armies, break off their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the King of Pruſſia, pay their quota of Roman months, and ſend their contingents to the army of execution, they were to be put under the ban of the Empire. To all other perſons who held any dignity in the Empire, orders were given and penalties were threatened ſuitable to their condition. They in ſhort went all lengths, but that of actually and formally putting them under the ban, which they would not have failed to do, if their ſucceſs had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered its beginnings. So little regard had the court of Vienna to former ſervices of the moſt intereſting nature; and ſo entirely did ſhe ſeem to forget that ſhe owed to the King of Great Britain, not only that power which ſhe now unjuſtly and ungratefully turned againſt him, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the very being of the Houſe of Auſtria. So entirely
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1261701201:90"/>
did ſhe forget that this Monarch had expended his treaſures, employed his armies, and even expoſed his perſon in her cauſe, when it was not only abandoned, but attacked by almoſt all the reſt of Europe. However the violent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Aulic council, drew no one State or perſon from the Kings of Great Britain and Pruſſia; they rather had a contrary effect, in rouſing the whole Evangelic body to a ſenſe of their own danger. Much leſs were they able to ſtop the progreſs of the allied arms.</p>
                        <p>The King of Pruſſia conducted his retreat out of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia in admirable order. The Generals Jahnus and Laudohn for ſeveral days hung upon his rear with two ſtrong bodies. They took advantageous poſts, ſometimes on one ſide, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the other, ſometimes together, ſometimes ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and threw all poſſibly impediments in his way. But the vigour of the Pruſſians drove them with loſs from every poſt. So that by the 6th of Auguſt, they were obliged entirely to deſiſt from their purſuit. The King of Pruſſia freed from all moleſtation, marched with the utmoſt diligence by Wiſoca, Politz, Landſhut, and arrived on the 20th at Franckfort on the Oder. Here he joined the troops under Count Dohna. The army was now in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to act,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sept. 22."/> 

 and they did not loſe a moment's time to march againſt the enemy. All their vigour and expedition was not more than neceſſary. The Ruſſians had beſieged Cuſtrin from the 15th. Though theſe people ſcarcely emerged from barbariſm, had not the moſt perfect ſkill in operations of this nature, they ſupplied that deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by a feroſity that ſcrupled nothing, by numbers whoſe lives they did not regard, and by a moſt formidable artillery, which rudely but furiouſly managed, only ſpread the more general and indiſcriminate deſtruction. In effect, they threw ſuch a multitude of bombs and red hot balls into that unfortunate city, that in a ſhort time it was on fire in every quarter. Of the wretched inhabitants ſome were burned, ſome buried in the ruins, ſome killed by the balls that fell like hail in the ſtreets: the ſurviving majority ſafe neither within nor without their houſes, abandoned their homes and their ſubſtance, and fled, many of them almoſt naked, out of the ſide which was not inveſted. Never was beheld a more deplorable ſpectacle; nor was it eaſy to ſay which formed the more wretched appearance, thoſe who periſhed, or thoſe who eſcaped. Mean while the Governor firm in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1261701201:91"/>
his courage and fidelity, did every thing for the defence of the walls and ruins of the place; but the walls built in the old manner did not promiſe a ſucceſsful defence; the enemy had poſted themſelves in the ſuburbs, and in the firing of the town, the principal magazine of the beſieged was blown up.</p>
                        <p>The protector and avenger of his dominions, was now however at hand. On the 23th, the King of Pruſſia's whole army paſſed the Oder at Gluſtebiſſel, about twenty Engliſh miles to the north-eaſt of Cuſtrin. The Ruſſians on the firſt notice of his approach, broke up the ſiege of that place, and marched towards the villages of Zwicker and Zorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorff. It was the King's intention to wind round the left flank of their army, and to take them in the rear, by which he hoped to throw them into confuſion. But in this he found himſelf diſappointed. The Ruſſian Generals had foreſeen his purpoſe and made excellent diſpoſitions. As the ground did not admit them to extend greatly in length, they threw themſelves into a ſquare body compoſed of four lines, forming a front almoſt equal on every ſide, and on every ſide ſurrounded by cannon and chevaux de frize. In this formidable diſpoſition they waited the attack of the Pruſſians.</p>
                        <p>It was on the 25th of Auguſt that the King of Pruſſia, after a march of 56 days, from the midſt of Moravia, brought his army in preſence of the Ruſſians. The King had never been perſonally engaged with that enemy before. His troops had never obtained any advantage over them. The whole fortune of the war depended upon the event of this day. The Pruſſians were now in the cloſeſt ſenſe to fight for their country, which was ready to fall under one of the ſevereſt ſcourges with which Providence has chaſtiſed a nation. Nothing was wanting which could inſpire the ſoldiers with revenge. Every where the marks of the enemies cruelty were before their eyes; the country deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated on every ſide, and the villages in flames all round the field of battle.</p>
                        <p>At nine o'clock in the morning the battle began by a fire of cannon and mortars which rained on the right wing of the Ruſſians without the leaſt intermiſſion for near two hours. Nothing could exceed the havock made by this terrible fire, nor the conſtancy with which the Muſcovite foot, raw and unexperienced, ſuſtained a ſlaughter that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1261701201:92"/>
would have confounded and diſperſed the compleateſt vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans. They fell in their ranks; new regiments ſtill preſſed forward to fill their places, and to ſupply new ſlaughter. When the firſt line had fired away all their charges, they ruſhed forward on the Pruſſians. That firm body of the Pruſſian infantry which had often ſtood, and often given ſo many terrible ſhocks, by one of thoſe unaccountable move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the human mind, that render every thing in war ſo precarious, gave way in the preſence of their Sovereign, and when they had in a manner ſecured the victory, retired in diſorder before the half broken battalions of the Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites. Had the Ruſſian officers known how to profit of this diſorder; had they immediately thrown in their horſe with vigour to compleat it, and entirely break that body; this had probably been the laſt day of the Pruſſian greatneſs. The King was not ſo negligent. For juſt in this anxious moment, whilſt the battle was yet in ſuſpenſe, by a very rapid and maſterly motion, he brought all the cavalry of his right to the centre, with which General Sedlitz at their head, burſting in upon the Ruſſian foot, uncovered by their horſe, and diſordered even by their advantage, they puſhed them back, with a moſt miſerable ſlaughter. The repulſed battalions of Pruſſia had time to recollect, and to form themſelves; and now returning to the onſet with a rage exaſperated by their late diſgrace, they entirely turned the ballance of the fight. The Ruſſians were thrown into the moſt horrid confuſion. The wind blew the duſt and ſmoke full in their faces. They no longer diſtinguiſhed friends or enemies. They fired upon each other. In this diſtraction they plundered their own baggage which ſtood between the lines, and intoxicated themſelves with brandy. Orders were now no more heard nor obeyed. The ranks fell in upon one another; and being crammed together in a narrow ſpace, every ſhot diſcharged by the Pruſſians had its full effect: whilſt the Ruſſians kept up only a ſcattered fire, without direction or effect, and quite over the heads of their enemies. It was now no longer battle, but a horrid and undiſtinguiſhed carnage. Yet ſtill, (which is a wonderful circumſtance) the Ruſſians thus diſtracted and ſlaughtered, kept their ground. The action continued without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from nine in the morning until ſeven at night. At laſt the night itſelf, the fatigue of the Pruſſians, and a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious attack on their right wing, which drew their attention
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1261701201:93"/>
on that ſide, gave the Ruſſian army ſome reſpite to recover their order, and an opportunity of retiring a little from the ſcene of their diſaſter. On their ſide near 10,000 fell upon the ſpot, they had more than 10,000 wounded, moſt of them mortally: 939 officers, not including the inferior, were killed, wounded, and taken priſoners; of two particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments conſiſting before the battle of 4595 effective men, only 1475 were left; their whole loſs on this bloody day way 21,529 men. That of the Pruſſians in every way did not amount to 2000.</p>
                        <p>The Gazettes of both parties warmly diſputed the vain honour of the field of battle. On the moſt diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, it appears that both parties ſpent the night on or very near the place of action. But this is an affair of little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. The Pruſſians had all the fruits, and moſt of the proofs of a victory the moſt complete and deciſive. A vaſt train of artillery taken, the military cheſt, a number of priſoners, many of them officers of high rank; the retreat of the Ruſſian army, the next and the following days; their General Fermor's requeſt for leave to bury the dead; their incapacity to advance or form any new enterpriſe; the King of Pruſſia's unmoleſted operations againſt his other enemies; all theſe form the moſt clear and certain demonſtration of a victory in all the points, for which a victory is deſirable.</p>
                        <p>Nothing leſs indeed, than a very complete victory could have done any eſſential ſervice to the King's affair at that time, when four armies of his enemies were making their way to one common centre, and threatened to unite in the heart of Brandenburg. The King renewed the attack on the Ruſſians the next morning. The event of the laſt day had ſhewed them, that there was no way of ſafety but in a retreat, and in effect they retreated before the Pruſſians as far as Landſperg on the frontiers of Poland. The King of Pruſſia was convinced that their late check muſt wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them from attempting any thing material againſt his dominions on that ſide; and he ſaw clearly that whatever he might hope to gain by improving his advantage againſt the Ruſſians, he muſt loſe far, more by allowing his other enemies to make a progreſs on the ſide of Saxony. He ſatisfied himſelf therefore with leaving a ſmall body of troops under Count Dohna, to obſerve the motions of the Muſcovite army; and marched with the greateſt part of his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1261701201:94"/>
forces and the utmoſt expedition to the relief of Prince Henry.</p>
                        <p>M. Daun having laid aſide his firſt project for paſſing the Elbe at Meiſſen, enterpriſed nothing new on the ſide of Saxony for ſome days; he contented himſelf with taking a poſition at Stolpen to the Eaſtward of the Elbe, by which, whilſt he preſerved to himſelf an eaſy communication with the army of the Empire, he interrupted the communication between Bautzen and Dreſden; he favoured the operations of General Laudohn, who had advanced through the Lower Luſatia to the confines of Brandenburgh; and by drawing the attention of the Pruſſian forces which were left in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſia to the northward of that dutchy, he facilitated the progreſs of the Generals Harach and de Ville in the ſouthern parts. Admirable diſpoſitions without queſtion, if the time had not called for more vigorous meaſures, and if the reſcue of Saxony from the King of Pruſſia had not been the great object of the campaign! It is not impoſſible that the court of Vienna had ſtill ſuch an hankering after Sileſia, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to ſlaken their efforts on the ſide of Saxony, in hopes, that if M. Daun could protract the operations there, ſo as to find full employment for the King of Pruſſia, their other forces might reduce Sileſia with great facility; and thus perhaps by aiming at two ſuch difficult objects at once, as it generally happens, they loſt them both. Upon any other ſuppoſition, it is not very eaſy to account for the ſeeming inactivity of M. Daun, whilſt he had ſo fair a game in his hands. However advantageouſly Prince Henry might have choſen his poſt, or however ſtrongly he might have ſecured it, yet the prodigious ſuperiority of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined armies ſeems to have more than over-balanced that advantage, and to have juſtified, nay to have demanded ſome bold and deciſive attempt.</p>
                        <p>In fact, this appeared at length to be the Marſhal's own opinion. For when the ſtrong Fortreſs of Sonneſtein moſt unaccountably ſurrendered, with a garriſon of 1400 men, to the Auſtrian General Mac-Guire after the reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of no more than a ſingle day;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sept. 5."/> 

 M. Daun pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the Prince of Deux-Ponts ſhould attack Prince Henry, whilſt the grand army of the Auſtrians laying bridges between two fires, at a ſmall diſtance from each other, ſhould paſs the Elbe, and falling at the ſame time on the Pruſſians,

                           <pb n="74" facs="tcp:1261701201:97"/>
towards Dreſden. This was to bring matters to a ſpeedy deciſion. But now the King of Pruſſia by the moſt rapid marches had reached the frontiers of Saxony. The whole deſign was diſconcerted; and far from being able to diſlodge Prince Henry, they found themſelves utterly unable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the King his brother from joining him, with his whole army.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sept. 11."/> 

 On his approach General Laudohn abandoned his advantages in the Lower Luſatia, and fell back upon M. Daun; who himſelf retired from the neighbourhood of Dreſden and fell back as far as Zittau. The army of the Empire poſſeſſed of the ſtrong poſt of Pirna, which the Saxons had occupied in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the war, kept their ground; but did not undertake any thing. Thus in fifteen days the king of Pruſſia, by his unparallelled ſpirit, diligence and magnanimity, fought and defeated a ſuperior body of his enemies, in one extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his dominions, and baffled without fighting another ſuperior body in the other extremity.</p>
                        <p>Theſe advantages, glorious as they were, were not the only ones which followed the victory at Zorndorf. The Swedes who directed their motions by thoſe of their Ruſſian allies, haſtened their operations when that army had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into Brandenburgh. General Wedel was detached from Saxony, to ſtop their progreſs; and the Prince of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, now Governor of Stettin, gave them ſome oppoſition. All this, however, had proved ineffectual, if the news of the defeat of the Ruſſians had not alarmed the Swedes in ſuch a manner, as to make them return with more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than they had advanced. Tho' the King of Pruſſia's affairs began to put on a better appearance by theſe efforts, the fortune of the war ſtill hung in a very dubious ſcale. The enemy was ſtill ſuperior. The Swedes and Ruſſians had ſtill ſome footing in his dominions. The Auſtrians and Imperialiſts were yet in Saxony; and if the King's armies had it in their power to take ſtrong ſituations; the enemy had the ſame advantages. The condition of things was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely critical, and the leaſt error or misfortune threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened ſtill to plunge the King of Pruſſia into an abyſs of calamities.</p>

                        <p>THE operations of the armies in Weſtphalia, ſeemed for a long time to languiſh. The grand army of the French under M. de Contades, was wholly unable to drive Prince Ferdinand from the poſts which he had choſen ſo ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly along the Lippe. The other diviſion of the French forces under the Prince de Soubiſe, had made no great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs on the ſide of Heſſe-Caſtle, againſt the Prince Iſenburg, who ſtill kept his ground in that principality, in order to protect the courſe of the Weſer, and to cover the electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. The French were ſenſible that an attack on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal army of the allies, would prove a very dangerous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, in which even if they ſhould have ſome ſucceſs, their progreſs into the King's electoral dominions muſt be very ſlow and difficult. But as the Body of the allies em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Heſſe-Caſtle was far the weakeſt, and as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage on that ſide promiſed them the command of the Weſer, and a better paſſage into the heart of the enemies country, they determined to make an attempt there. To further this deſign, a conſiderable detachment was made from the army of M. de Contades, which increaſed the Prince of Soubiſe's corps to at leaſt 30,000 men. Prince Ferdinand, who was ſufficiently aware of the enemies plan, had ſome time before ſent General Oberg with a ſtrong reinforcement to join the Prince Iſenburg; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this reinforcement, the whole force of the allies in Heſſe did not exceed 15000. This body was attacked by the French at Lanwerenhagen, and their great ſuperiority, eſpecially in point of cavalry,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sept. 30."/> 

 obliged the allies to retire with the loſs of about 1500 men. The allies unable to keep the field, had however ſome woods in their rear which covered their retreat, and they preſerved ſo good a countenance as prevented their defeat from becoming total.</p>

Iſenburgh having fallen back upon him, they joined in ſuch a manner as perfectly to ſecure the Weſer, without loſing any thing on the ſide of the Rhine. And although theſe neceſſary motions, in ſome ſort uncovered the electorate, ſo as to lay it open to the incurſions of the enemies light troops, who penetrated even to the gates of Hanover; yet the French were not in a condition to eſtabliſh any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable body, or to take any poſt of moment in that part.</p>
                        <p>During this time, the armies of the King of Pruſſia and M. Daun, made no very remarkable movements. The Marſhal kept his advantageous camp at Stolpen, by which he preſerved a communication with the army of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The army was ſecured by its inacceſſible ſituation, but it enterpriſed nothing of conſequence. The King of Pruſſia on the other hand, having taken poſſeſſion of the important poſt of Bautzen, which lies ſo opportunely for commanding at once both Miſnia and Luſatia, extended his right wing to Hochkirchen. By this poſition he preſerved a communication with the army of his brother prince Henry, he protected Brandenburg from the incurſions of the Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trians, and at the ſame time that he ſecured theſe intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objects, he was better ſituated for throwing ſuccours into Sileſia, than he could be any where elſe conſiſtently with his general plan. The two armies kept the moſt watchful eye upon each others motions. The principal aim of the King of Pruſſia, ſeemed to have been the preventing M. Daun from communicating with Bohemia. The great intention of M. Daun was to cut off the King from Sileſia. Things were ſo ballanced, that it did not ſeem poſſible by mere ſkill in marches and poſitions to anſwer theſe ends very fully: therefore a battle ſeemed inevitable. But it ſeemed too that conſidering the ſituation of both armies, a battle could not be attempted without extreme danger to the party who ſhould begin the attack.</p>
                        <p>M. Daun ſaw that if any more time was loſt without action, the very ſeaſon muſt oblige him to evacuate Saxony, and thus give up all the fruits of the campaign. He came
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1261701201:102"/>
to a reſolution of giving the King of Pruſſia Battle. But even in the vigour of this reſolution, appeared the extreme caution which characteriſes that able General. Having communicated his deſign to the prince of Deux-Ponts, and ſettled meaſures with him, he marched in the dead of a very dark night, in three columns, towards the right of the King of Pruſſia's camp. Notwithſtanding the darkneſs of the night, notwithſtanding the neceſſary diviſion of the Auſtrian army,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Oct. 14."/> 

 the greatneſs of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and the length of way they had to march, yet ſuch was the wiſe conduct and great good fortune of this deſign, that they all arrived at the ſame time at the Pruſſian camp, none having loſt their way, without diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, without confuſion, and began the attack with the utmoſt regularity and reſolution at five o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>How the King's out-guards were kept ſo as to make ſuch a ſurpriſe practicable, is hard to ſay. It is hard to accuſe the vigilance of ſo able a commander, or the attention of ſo many finiſhed officers as ſerved under him. To ſpeak of treachery is a way of accounting for misfortunes, more common than reaſonable. However it was, the Pruſſians had not time to ſtrike their tents, when they found the enemy in the midſt of the camp, and an impetuous attack already begun. Scarce had the battle begun, when a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat ſeemed certain; not ſo much from the confuſion of the troops, as the irreparable loſs of two officers in the higheſt command, and of the greateſt merit. M. Keith received two muſquet balls, and fell dead upon the ſpot. Prince Francis of Brunſwick had his head ſhot off by a cannon ball as he mounted his horſe. The King of Pruſſia had then the whole of affairs to ſuſtain alone, at the time when he moſt wanted aſſiſtance. But his preſence of mind, his firmneſs, his activity, remedied in ſome meaſure the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this unforſeen attack, and the loſſes and diſorders it had occaſioned; he was every where preſent, and inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his troops with an a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>dor like his own. The King or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſome detachments from his left, to reinforce his right wing; but in the moment the orders were received, the left itſelf was furiouſly attacked. General Retzow who commanded in that quarter, with difficulty repulſed the Auſtrians, and was not able to afford any conſiderable aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1261701201:103"/>
to the right, which was alone obliged to ſupport the whole weight of the grand attack.</p>
                        <p>The Auſtrians in the beginning of the engagement had beaten them out of the village of Hochkirchen; as the fate of the day depended upon that poſt, the hotteſt of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute was there. The Pruſſians made three bloody and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful attacks on the village; on the fourth they carried it; but the Auſtrians pouring continually freſh troops upon that ſpot, drove them out at length after reiterated efforts, and a prodigious ſlaughter on all ſides. Then the King deſpairing of the fortune of that field, ordered a retreat: his troops, which had been ſuddenly attacked in a dark night by ſuperior numbers, and had run to arms ſome half naked, and all in the utmoſt confuſion, had, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, made a moſt vigorous reſiſtance; and maintained the fight for near five hours. They made their retreat in good order without being purſued, ſupported by the good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their cavalry, and the fire of the numerous and well ſerved artillery, which was placed in the centre of their camp. They loſt in this bloody action at leaſt 7000 men, killed, wounded and priſoners, together with many cannon. The Auſtrian account allowed their own loſs in killed and wounded to amount to near 5000.</p>
                        <p>The King of Pruſſia, in retiring from Hochkirchen, in fact only altered the poſition of his right wing, which fell back as far as Weiſſenberg. His left ſtill remained at Baut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen. This poſition was nearly as good as the former. The great loſs was the loſs of reputation, which always attends a defeat, and the loſs of two great generals which attended this in particular. M. Keith was a Scochman born. He engaged with his brother the Lord Marſhal in the Rebellion of 1715. Being obliged to relinquiſh his country on this occaſion, he entered into the troops of Spain, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards paſſing into Ruſſia, he obtained a conſiderable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and performed many ſignal ſervices in their wars with Turkey and Sweden; and ſerved them alſo in peace by ſeveral embaſſies. But finding the honours of that country no better than a ſplendid ſervitude, and not meeting with thoſe rewards, which his long and faithful ſervices deſerved, he left that court for one where merit is better known and better rewarded: and having been employed ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the war in a diſtinguiſhed command in the King
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1261701201:104"/>
of Pruſſia's armies, he fell at laſt in a ſervice that was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him.</p>
                        <p>If the King of Pruſſia loſt ſome reputation in ſuffering himſelf to be ſurpriſed in this affair; he fully retrieved it by his extraordinary conduct in the courſe of the action, and his admirable efforts after it. On the whole, perhaps, when all circumſtances are conſidered, the King of Pruſſia will appear greater in this defeat, than in any victory he ever yet obtained. The wing of his army that was attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was ſurpriſed at a diſtance from him, the two Generals that commanded it ſlain in the firſt onſet, his other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Generals wounded, the whole wing in confuſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a leader; to come, in theſe deſperate circumſtances, in haſte from another quarter; to recover all; twice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe the enemy, and at laſt to retire, overborne only by numbers and fatigue, without being purſued, is ſuch an inſtance of great Generalſhip, as perhaps has never been exceeded.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt theſe things were doing in Saxony, the Ruſſians made no farther attempts on the Side of Brandenburgh; they remained in their camp near Landſperg, until the 21ſt of September; when after ſeveral feigned motions, made to cover their real deſign, they began their retreat towards Pomerania, where they arrived on the 26th.</p>
                        <p>It was impoſſible that they ſhould keep their ground in that province during the winter, unleſs they could ſecure ſome ſea-port, from whence they might be ſupplied with proviſions. The little town of Colberg was very opportune for that purpoſe, as it is a ſea-port on the Baltick, and ſo meanly fortified, that the reduction of it appeared to be as eaſy as expedient. On the third of October, they formed the ſiege of this inconſiderable place, with a body of 15000 men. But ſuch was the bravery of Major Heydon the Governor; and ſuch the incapacity of the Ruſſians for ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of this nature, that this little town, defended only by a rampart, without any outwork, and lined with a very feeble garriſon, held out againſt the repeated attacks of the enemy twenty-ſix days,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Oct. 29."/> 

 and then obliged them to raiſe the ſiege, without any ſuccours whatſoever from without. This was the laſt enterpriſe of the Ruſſians. Their vaſt army retired with diſgrace, firſt from Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and then from Pomerania; not being able to maſter one place of ſtrength in either country; but having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1261701201:105"/>
with the moſt ſavage barbarity both the open towns and defenceleſs villages; leaving as ſtrong impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of contempt for their incapacity, as of horror for their cruelty.</p>
                        <p>After the defeat which the King received at Hochkirchen, he omitted no meaſures to prevent the enemy from making any material advantage of it. He perceived clearly, that the advantage they propoſed to derive from it, was to cover the operations of their armies in Sileſia; and that they had no longer any ſerious deſign upon Saxony during this campaign. The King therefore, made no ſcruple to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force his army by conſiderable detachments from that of Prince Henry, which were brought up by that Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And as he ſaw that Neiſs, the ſiege of which had been already formed and proſecuted with great vigour, muſt certainly ſurrender if it were not ſpeedily ſuccoured, he reſolved to march into Sileſia.</p>
                        <p>To the execution of this deſign, the greateſt difficulties ſtarted up on all ſides. The army of M. Daun, lately vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, had no other buſineſs than to intercept him. To fight was dubious; to avoid it hard. If he could even avoid a battle, he had much to apprehend from the efforts of the enemy to harraſs him on his march. If he ſhould be ſo happy as to eſcape or conquer theſe difficulties, yet his march entirely uncovered Saxony, and abandoned that moſt intereſting poſſeſſion, very poorly defended, to all the force of two powerful armies.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if the conſideration of Saxony ſhould detain him in his preſent ſituation, Sileſia ran the ſame riſque, and the ſame or greater diſadvantages muſt enſue to his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, by ſuffering the Auſtrians to obtain a footing there. This dilemma, which would have rendered a meaner genius entirely inactive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hindered him from taking any reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, only obliged the King of Pruſſia to take his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution with the greater ſpeed, and to execute it with the greater vigour.</p>
                        <p>On the 24th of November at night, he quitted his camp at Dobreſchutz, and making a great compaſs he arrived, without any obſtruction from the enemy, in the plain of Gorlitz. A body of the Auſtrians had in vain endeavoured to ſecure this poſt before him; thoſe that arrived were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, with the loſs of 800 men. By this happy march, all the advantages of M. Daun's ſtudied poſition, of all the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1261701201:106"/>
fruits his boaſted victory at Hochkirchen, were loſt in a moment, and an open paſſage to Sileſia lay before the King. He purſued his march with the greateſt diligence. General Laudohn, with 24,000 men was ſent to purſue him. That active general continually harraſſed his rear guard; but the King continued his march without interruption, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to take many little advantages, rather than by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying to conteſt ſmall matters, to endanger a deſign, which might be deciſive of the whole campaign.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, Daun, not content with the obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which General Laudohn threw in the King's way, ſent a large body of horſe and foot by another route to reinforce the army which under the Generals Harſch and De Ville had formed the ſiege of Neiſs, and the blockade of Coſel. But he perceived that all theſe meaſures would probably prove ineffectual, as his principal project, which was to cover Sileſia, had been defeated. He therefore turned his views towards Saxony, and ſatisfying himſelf with detaching Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Laudohn, which might create an opinion that the whole Auſtrian army purſued, he followed the King no further than Gorlitz; which place he immediately quitted, and having by forced marches gained the Elbe, he paſſed that river at Pirna,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Nov. 6."/> 

 and advanced towards Dreſden. At the ſame time the army of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, by its motions having obliged the Pruſſian army then extremely weakened by the detachments that had been drawn from it, to retire from its poſt before Dreſden, ſome miles to the weſtward of that city, cut off their communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with Leipſic, whilſt M. Daun attempted to cut off their communication with Dreſden; but they found means to throw themſelves into that city, and afterwards to retire to the other ſide of the Elbe. The Auſtrians and Imperial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts began at once to inveſt thoſe two important places; another party advanced towards Torgau, an attempted that town. It ſeemed utterly impoſſible to prevent the Auſtrians from becoming maſters of Saxony, who in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner covered the whole country with their forces.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, the King of Pruſſia drew nearer and nearer to Neiſs. The ſiege of that fortreſs was commenced on the 4th of Auguſt; on the 3d of October it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely inveſted; and the place was puſhed on one ſide with the greateſt vigour, and on the other maintained with the moſt conſummate ſkill and bravery, until the approach of

the King of Pruſſia obliged the Auſtrians, on the 1ſt. of November, to raiſe the ſiege, leaving a conſiderable quantity of military ſtores behind them. The ſame terror obliged the parties employed in the blockade of Coſel, to leave that place at liberty, and to fall back, together with the armies of the Generals Harſch and De Ville, into Bohemia, and the Auſtrian Sileſia.</p>
                        <p>The King of Pruſſia, when he had thus by the report of his march, without fighting, driven his enemies out of Sileſia,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Nov. 9."/> 

 loſt not a moment to return by the ſame route, and with the ſame expedition to the relief of Saxony. Two bodies of his troops had moved for the ſame purpoſe out of Pomerania, one under Count Doh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and one under General Wedel. The corps under We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del had thrown itſelf into T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>g. The grand operation of the Auſtrians was againſt Dreſden. M. Daun, with an army of 60,000 men, came before that city, on the very Day on which the King of Pruſſia began his march to oppoſe him, ſo that he might well imagine his ſucceſs certain againſt a place meanly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and defended only by 12,000 men. The ſame day he began to cannonade it, and his light troops, ſupported by the grenadiers of the army, made a ſharp attack upon the ſuburbs. The Governor, Count Schmettau, ſaw that from the weakneſs of the ſuburbs it would prove impoſſible for him to prevent the enemy from poſſeſſing themſelves of them by a <hi>coup de main,</hi> and if they ſucceeded in this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, the great height of the Houſes, being ſix or ſeven ſtories, and entirely commanding the ramparts, would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reduction of the body of the place equally eaſy and certain. Theſe conſiderations determined him to ſet theſe ſuburbs on fire.</p>
                        <p>It is well known that the ſuburbs of Dreſden compoſe one of the fineſt towns in Europe, and are greatly ſuperior to that which lies within the walls. Here the moſt wealthy parts of the Inhabitants reſide, and here are carried on thoſe ſeveral curious manufactures for which Dreſden is ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. Count Daun foreſaw this conſequence of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. He endeavoured to intimidate the Governor from this meaſure, to which he knew the cruel reaſon of war would naturally lead him, by threatening to make him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally anſwerable for the ſteps he ſhould take; but Count
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1261701201:110"/>
Schmettau anſwered with the firmneſs that became a man of honour and a ſoldier, that he would anſwer whatever he ſhould do, and would not only burn the ſuburbs, in caſe M. Daun advanced, but would likewiſe defend the city it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſtreet by ſtreet, and at laſt even the caſtle, which was the royal reſidence, if he ſhould be driven to it. When the magiſtrates were appriſed of this reſolution, they fell at the feet of Count Schmettau, and implored him to change his mind, and to have mercy on that devoted part of their city. The part of the royal family, who remained in Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, joined their ſupplications to thoſe of the magiſtrates; they prayed him to ſpare that laſt refuge of diſtreſſed royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to allow at leaſt a ſecure reſidence to thoſe, who had been deprived of every thing elſe. All entreaties were vain. Schmettau continued firm in his reſolution. He told them that their ſafety d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ded on themſelves, and on M. Daun; that if he made no attempts, the ſuburbs ſhould be ſtill ſecure; but that if he took any farther ſteps, the neceſſity of his maſter's ſervice, and his own honour, would compel him to act very diſagreeable to the lenity of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. The magiſtrates retired in deſpair. Combuſtibles were laid in all the houſes.</p>
                        <p>At three a clock next morning,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Nov. 10."/> 

 the ſignal for firing the ſuburbs was given, and in a moment a place ſo lately the ſeat of eaſe and luxury, flouriſhing in traffick, in pleaſures and ingenious arts, was all in flames. A calamity ſo dreadful needs no high colouring. However, as little miſchief attended ſuch a combuſtion, as the Nature of the thing could admit. Very few loſt their lives; but many their whole ſubſtance. When this was done, the Pruſſian troops abandoned the flaming ſuburbs, and retired in good order into the city.</p>
                        <p>M. Daun ſaw this fire, which, whilſt it laid waſte the capital of his ally, made it more difficult for him to force it, he ſent in ſome empty threats to the Governor. But the Saxon miniſter at Ratiſbon, made grievous complaints to the Diet, of what he repreſented as the moſt unparalleled act of wanton and unprovoked cruelty, that had ever been committed. The emiſſaries of the court of Vienna ſpread the ſame complaints; and they made no ſcruple to invent, and to alter facts in ſuch a manner as to move the greateſt pity towards the ſufferers, and the greateſt indignation againſt the King of Pruſſia. All theſe, however, were in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1261701201:111"/>
a ſhort time abundantly confuted, by the authentick certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates of the magiſtrates of Dreſden, and of thoſe officers of the court, who were perfectly acquainted with the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action. By theſe certificates it appears, that only 250 houſes were conſumed. Though this was a terrible cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; it was nothing to the accounts given in the gazettes of the Auſtrian faction. By theſe certificates it appears alſo, that the people were not ſurpriſed, but had ſufficient notice of the Governor's intentions, to enable them to provide for their ſafety. In a word, all the charges of cruelty againſt the Pruſſian commander, and ſoldiery were fully overthrown.</p>
                        <p>This fire made a <hi>coup de main</hi> impracticable; regular operations demanded time, and the King of Pruſſia was now in full march towards Saxony. M. Daun retired from before the place on the 17th. The King, after croſſing Luſatia, paſſing the Elbe, and joyning his troops under Count Dohna and General Wedel, arrived triumphantly at Dreſden on the 20th. The armies of M. Daun and the Empire gave way towards Bohemia, into which kingdom they ſoon after finally retreated, without enterpriſing any thing further. Six ſieges were raiſed almoſt at the ſame time; that of Colberg, carried on by General Palmbach, under the orders of Marſhal Fermor; that of Neiſs by M. de Harſch; that of Coſel; that of Dreſden by M. Daun; the blockade of Torgau by M. Haddick; and that of Leipſick by the Prince of Deux-Ponts.</p>
                        <p>About the time that the Auſtrians retired into winter quarters, the French did the ſame; and the Hanoverians permitted them to do it without moleſtation, the ſeaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too far advanced, and their army perhaps not of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtrength for offenſive operations; and Prince Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand kept the field no longer. The Britiſh troops had no occaſion of ſignalizing their bravery this year; but without a battle the nation ſuffered a conſiderable loſs, and was touched with a very deep and general ſorrow. The Duke of Marlborough died in Munſter, the 20th of October, of a fever, contracted by the fatigues of the Campaign. Never did the nation loſe in one man, a temper more candid and benevolent, manners more amiable and open, a more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive integrity, a more exalted generoſity, a more warm and feeling heart. He left all the enjoyments, which an ample fortune and an high rank could beſtow in the publick
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1261701201:112"/>
eye; and which every milder virtue, every diſpoſition to make and to be made happy, could give in a domeſtic life: he left theſe for the ſervice of his country, and died for its defence, as he had lived for its ornament and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                        <p>If we compare the events of this year with thoſe of the laſt, we ſhall find in the actions of the preſent year, perhaps ſomething leſs of that aſtoniſhing eclat; fewer battles; not ſo many nor ſo ſtriking revolutions of fortune; but we may diſcover upon all ſides far greater management, and a more ſtudied and refined conduct; more artful movements, a more judicious choice of poſts, more quick and vigorous marches. If in the laſt year, the King of Pruſſia was the hero of the imagination, he is this year the hero of the judgment; and we have, I think, reaſon to admire him upon juſter princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Obliged to evacuate Moravia, he throws himſelf into Bohemia, and executes a retreat with all the ſpirit of an invaſion. He marches more than an hundred miles through an enemy's country, followed and harraſſed by large armies, who are unable to obtain any advantage over him. Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at length his own territories, he engages the vaſt army of the Ruſſians and defeats it. He is unable to follow his blow, but he diſables them from ſtriking any againſt that part of his dominions, which he is obliged to leave. Whilſt he is engaged with the Ruſſians on the frontiers of Poland, the Auſtrians and Imperialiſts enter Saxony. Before they can do any thing deciſive, the King is himſelf ſuddenly in Saxony, and by his preſence, at once diſconcerts all their projects. The ſcene is again changed, they ſurpriſe him in his camp at Hochkirchen, two of his Generals are killed, his army defeated, his camp is taken. They attack Sileſia with a formidable army. Notwithſtanding his late defeat; notwithſtanding the great ſuperiority of his enemies; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the advantage of their poſts; he makes an amazing ſweep about all their forces, eludes their vigilance, renders their poſitions unprofitable; and marching with an aſtoniſhing rapidity into the remoteſt parts of Sileſia, obliges the Auſtrian armies to retire with precipitation out of that province. Then he flies to the relief of Saxony, which his enemies had again profited of his abſence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade; and again by the ſame rapid and well conducted march, he obliges them to abandon their prize. Defeated by the Auſtrians he acquired by his conduct all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1261701201:113"/>
to the moſt compleat victory. He guarded all his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions in ſuch a manner, as to enable them all the endure his abſence for ſome ſhort time; and he conducted his marches with ſuch ſpirit, as did not make it neceſſary to them to hold out any longer; he made twice the circuit of his dominions, and in their turn he relieved them all.</p>
                        <p>Nor was the conduct of Prince Ferdinand of Brunſwick leſs worthy of admiration. Placed at the Head of a body of troops, who were but lately obliged to lay down their arms, he found the enemy in poſſeſſion of the whole open country, and of all the ſtrong places in it. Commencing the campaign in the midſt of a ſevere winter, without any place of ſtrength in his hands, he drove the enemy from all thoſe they held. He obliged them to repaſs the Rhine, he followed and defeated them in a pitched battle. Being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards obliged by the great force of France on its own frontier, and the numerous armies they had in different pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to repaſs the Rhine; he defended Lippe againſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers greatly ſuperior, and though they defeated a part of his army, they were not able to turn their victory to the leaſt advantage. Prince Ferdinand's campaign may well paſs for a perfect model of defenſive operations.</p>
                        <p>The Auſtrians, in taking winter quarters, diſpoſed their forces ſo as to form a chain of an amazing length, from the frontiers of Moravia paſſing through Bohemia, all along the ſkirts of Sileſia and the borders of Saxony. There the Imperial army joined this chain, and continued it through Thuringia and Franconia, where it was united to the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Prince de Soubiſe.

a communication between this and the Pruſſian army, as well as to break ſome part of that formidable chain of the enemy, the King ſent ſome bodies of his troops into Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringia, who diſpoſſeſſed the army of the Empire of ſeveral of their poſts there, and they now threaten to penetrate ſtill farther.</p>
                        <p>The King of Pruſſia, when he had a ſecond time driven the Auſtrians and Imperialiſts out of Saxony, reſolved to keep no meaſures with that unhappy country. He declared that he was reſolved no longer to conſider it as a depoſit, but as a country which he had twice ſubdued by his arms. He therefore ordered thoſe of the King of Poland's privy council, who ſtill remained at Dreſden, to retire at a very ſhort warning. But if the King of Pruſſia had a right, as perhaps he had to conſider Saxony as a lawful conqueſt, he certainly ſeemed not to conſider the people as ſubjects, when he continued to exact the moſt ſevere contributions; and in a manner too, very little becoming a lawful ſovereign; for he ſurrounded the exchange with ſoldiers, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the merchants in narrow lodgings on ſtraw beds, he obliged them by extreme ſuffering, to draw bills on their foreign correſpondents for very large ſums. This city had been quite exhauſted by former payments, and had not long before ſuffered military execution. And enemy that acted thus, had acted ſeverely; but when a country is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely poſſeſſed by any power, and claimed as a conqueſt, the rights of war ſeem to ceaſe; and the people have a claim to be governed in ſuch a manner as becomes a juſt Prince; eſpecially when no extreme neceſſity in his affairs compels him to theſe rigorous courſes. To retaliate on theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable people ſome part of the cruelties committed by the Ruſſians on his dominions ſeems to be very unreaſonable, as it is but too obvious, that the barbarity of that people could not be reſtrained, however it might be exaſperated by the total deſtruction of Saxony. Such retaliations are odious and cruel. We heartily wiſh we could praiſe the King of Pruſſia as much for his temporate uſe of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, as for thoſe wonderful and heroic qualities by which he obtained it. We might be conſidered as partial in our account, if we had omitted to take notice of what is alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the King of Pruſſia, when we have ſpoken ſo fully of the outrages committed by his enemies.

                        </argument>
                        <p>IN the beginning of this year, the good condition of our navy and our army; the ſpirit and popularity of the miniſtry; the wiſe choice of commanders, in contempt of vulgar and trivial maxims; the prevalence of the contrary to all theſe amongſt the enemy; gave us the beſt grounded hopes of a vigorous and ſucceſsful campaign. Concerning the theatre of our operations there was ſome doubt. It was the opinion of ſome, that our puſh in Europe ſhould be made on the ſide of Germany; and that we ought to ſtrengthen the army of Prince Ferdinand with ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable body of troops, as might enable that finiſhed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander to exert all his talents, and to improve to the utmoſt the advantages he had already obtained over the French. They imagined, that if an early and conſiderable reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were ſent to the Prince, whilſt the French army was yet in a diſtreſſed condition, and if in this condition that ſhould receive any conſiderable blow, they would find it extremely difficult to retrieve it: and receiving this blow, on the frontier of their own territories, the Prince might carry the war into France itſelf; and thus very probably bring matters to a ſpeedy deciſion. That in purſuing this plan a diverſion on the coaſt of France was by no means excluded: and that on the contrary it muſt, on this plan, be attended with conſequences infinitely more important than it could otherwiſe; that otherwiſe, France might laugh at the little deſultory efforts of an handful of men, who were to be embarked and diſ-embarked with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and hazard, and which would always be obliged to fly at the firſt approach of an enemy. That whilſt the French had only an army, greatly inferior in number to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage on the ſide of Germany, they would always find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1261701201:116"/>
well able to act abroad, and defend themſelves at home.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand it was ſtrongly urged, that we ought to make the deſtruction of the French marine our great object, and to conſider all continental operations only in a ſecondary light. That by ſending a large body of Engliſh troops to the King's army on the Rhine, we muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily weaken our efforts in America, and on the coaſt of France; and by drawing away all our forces, we muſt ſhake that internal ſecurity, which invigorated all our operations abroad. That whilſt we maintained an army of 50,000 foreigners in Germany, it would be the greateſt imprudence to ſend alſo a large body of our own national troops into the ſame country, and by that means not only ſquander away our men, but employ almoſt every penny granted for the Land ſervice, out of Great Britain; a method which could not fail of exhauſting us in a very ſhort time. That the force already in Germany was ſufficient to keep the French engaged, and that the propoſed expeditions to France would, be attacking the coaſt, now in one part, now in another, and keeping all parts in continual alarms, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily detain a very conſiderable part of their forces at home, and thus make a powerful diverſion, whilſt it was purſuing what ought to be the grand perpetual object of all our operations, the deſtruction of the French maritime power.</p>
                        <p>The latter opinion prevailed; but it was however ſo far modified by the arguments on the other ſide, that after ſome time a few regiments were ſent into Germany, as we have before related. Theſe and better reaſons, no doubt, determined the operations on the coaſt of France; but whilſt the neceſſary preparations were making, their deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was kept an inviolable ſecret; and now, as they had the year before, inſpired France with no little terror. Two ſquadrons, by the latter end of May, were in readineſs for ſailing. The greater under Lord Anſon, the ſmaller under Commodore Howe, which was ſo deſigned to convoy the tranſports, and to favour the landing and re-imbarkment. The land forces conſiſted of ſixteen battalions, and nine troops of light horſe: they were commanded by the late Duke of Marlborough. They ſailed from Portſmouth: but as ſoon as the fleet ſet ſail,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 1."/> 

 the ſquadron of my Lord Anſon ſeparated from the reſt, and bore off to the Bay of Biſcay, in order to ſpread the alarm more
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1261701201:117"/>
widely, and to obſerve the French ſquadron in Breſt. The other part of the fleet, which was commanded by Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Howe, with the tranſports, arrived without any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in Cancalle Bay, at a ſmall diſtance from the City of St. Maloes. Here the troops landed without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5th."/> 

 and having fortified a poſt near Cancalle (a poſt by nature well fitted for defence) for the ſecurity of their retreat, they marched in two columns to St. Maloes. When the army arrived there it was ſoon vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that the town, ſtrongly ſituated on a peninſula, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with the main land only by a long and narrow cauſeway, was by no means a proper object of a <hi>coup de main;</hi> and though for want of outworks, it was ill qualified to ſuſtain a regular ſiege; yet our forces were, for want of ſtrength and artillery ſufficient, altogether as ill qualified for ſuch an operation. They were therefore contented with ſetting fire to about an hundred ſail of ſhipping many of them privateers,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8th."/> 

 which lay under the cannon of the town, and to ſeveral magazines filled with naval ſtores. The damage was very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; yet, what is to be remarked, the enemy did not fire a ſingle ſhot on the detachment employed in this ſervice. Having nothing more to do on this ſide, they retired to Cancalle; and reimbarked with as little oppoſition as they met with at landing;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12th."/> 

 the land and ſea com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders having made all the diſpoſitions with great judgment.</p>
                        <p>Before the fleet returned, they reconnoitred the town of Granville on the coaſt of Normandy; but finding that a large body of troops were encamped in the neighbourhood, they made no attempt there. From thence they moved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Cherbourg, and made the proper diſpoſitions for landing near that place; but a hard gale blowing into the ſhore, and the tranſports beginning to fall foul on each other, it became extremely hazardous to attempt landing. Beſides, the proviſion was near exhauſted, and the ſoldiers by being ſo long cooped up in the tranſports, were grown ſickly. It became highly neceſſary to return home, and they arrived at St. Helen's on the 29th-of June.</p>
                        <p>The ſucceſs of this expedition, by which the French ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered largely, with ſcarce any loſs on our ſide, though it ſufficiently anſwered the intention of the armament, fell ſomewhat ſhort of the expectations of the public, who
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1261701201:118"/>
had formed much greater hopes, than it was poſſible for the nature of ſuch enterpriſes to fulfil. However, their hopes were again revived; by ſeeing that every thing was prepared for another expedition, and that our armies and fleets were to be kept in conſtant action during the ſummer. The time was now come when we were to turn the tables upon France, and to retaliate by real attacks, the terrors which had been raiſed by her menaces of an invaſion. The Duke of Marlborough had now taken the command of the Engliſh forces in Germany; and General Bligh ſucceeded him in this command. Prince Edward reſolved to go upon the expedition, and to form himſelf for the ſervice of his country under ſo brave and able a commander as Howe. It is eaſy to imagine, how much the ſpirit, the preſence and example of the gallant young Prince, who went with the utmoſt chearfulneſs through all the detail of a midſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's duty, inſpired both the ſeamen and the troops.</p>
                        <p>On the firſt of Auguſt, the fleet ſet ſail from St. Helen's. In a few days they came to anchor before Cherbourg. The French had drawn a line ſtrengthened by forts, along the moſt propable places for landing. They had drawn down three regiments of regular troops, and a conſiderable body of militia to the ſhore, and had in all appearance threatened a very reſolute oppoſition to the deſcent of the Engliſh forces. But the Commodore diſpoſed the men of war and bomb ketches ſo judiciouſly, and made ſo ſharp a fire upon the enemy, that they never ventured out of their entrenchments;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 6."/> 

 ſo that the landing was effected in excellent order, and with very little loſs. The French who made ſo poor an oppoſition to the landing, had ſtill many advantages from the nature of the ground which they occupied; but they neglected them all; and abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a moſt ſhameful deſpair their forts and lines on the coaſt, they ſuffered the Engliſh to enter Cherbourg the day after the landing, without throwing the leaſt obſtacle in their way. It muſt be remembered too, that the whole number of the Engliſh forces on this expedition was rather ſhort of 6000 men.</p>
                        <p>Cherbourg is on the land ſide an open town; neither is it very ſtrongly defended towards the ſea. The harbour is naturally bad. But the place is well ſituated, in the midſt of the channel, for protecting the French, and annoying the Engliſh commerce in time of war and perhaps for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitating
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1261701201:119"/>
an invaſion on England itſelf. Monſieur Belidor the famous engineer, had demonſtrated its importance, and propoſed a plan for the improvement and defence of the harbour, as well as for the fortifications of the town. This plan was approved and partly put in execution by the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a mole, digging a baſon and making ſluices and flood gates with excellent materials and a vaſt expence. The work had been for a conſiderable time diſcontinued; but in this expedition, that work of ſo great ingenuity, charge, and labour, was totally deſtroyed. Whilſt our humanity regrets the unhappy neceſſity of war, we cannot help think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Engliſh nation was freed by the ſucceſs of this expedition, from what might one day be cauſe of no trivial alarms.</p>
                        <p>When this work of deſtruction was over, all the veſſels in the harbour burned, and hoſtages taken for the contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions levied on the town, the forces reimbarked, with great ſpeed and ſafety without any interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the enemy,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16th."/> 

 and with the ſame expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, care and conduct, as they had been firſt landed; the army having continued ten days unmoleſted in France.</p>
                        <p>The Nation exulted greatly in this advantage, eſpecially as it almoſt accompanied the news of our glorious ſucceſſes in America. Nothing was omitted to give the action its utmoſt eclat; the braſs cannon and mortars taken at Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, were drawn from Kenſington to the tower, quite through the city, in great pomp and order, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſtreamers,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sept. 16."/> 

 attended by guards, drums, muſic, and whatever elſe might draw the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vulgar. They who cenſured this proceſſion as too oſtentatious, did not conſider, how forcibly things of this nature ſtrike upon ordinary minds, and how greatly they contribute to keep the people in good humour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the many charges and loſſes that are incident to the moſt ſucceſsful war.</p>
                        <p>The fleet when it left Cherbourg, was driven to the coaſt of England; but the troops were not diſembarked; it was reſolved, that the coaſt of France ſhould have no reſpite; and accordingly they ſailed towards St. Maloes, and landed in the bay of St. Lunar at a ſmall diſtance from the town of St. Maloes. This choice of a place for land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, muſt neceſſarily have ſurpriſed all thoſe who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered upon what reaſons the attempt againſt that place had
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1261701201:120"/>
been ſo recently laid aſide. There was no other object of ſufficient conſideration near it. The town was at leaſt in as good a poſture of defence as it had been then; and the force which was to attack it had ſince then been conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably leſſened. There is undoubtedly ſomething very unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable as well in the choice as in the whole conduct of this affair. The perſons in the principal commands, ſhifted the blame from one to another. There is nothing more remote from our deſign, than to ſet up for judges in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this nature; or ungenerouſly to lean on any officer, who, meaning well to the ſervice of his country, by ſome misfortune or miſtake fails in ſuch hazardous and intricate enterpriſes. We ſhall be ſatisfied with relating the facts as they happened.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as the troops were landed in the bay of St. Lunar, it became evident that the deſign againſt St. Maloes was utterly impracticable. Other projects were then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but they all ſeemed equally liable to objection. Whilſt they debated concerning a plan for their operations, the fleet was in the greateſt danger. The bay of St. Lunar is extremely rocky; and the experience of the people of the country, together with what he ſaw himſelf, convinced the Commodore that it was impoſſible to remain any longer in this road with tolerable ſafety. Therefore he moved up to the bay of St. Cas, about three leagues to the weſtward.</p>
                        <p>The fleet was ſeparated from the land forces; but it was ſtill eaſy to preſerve a communication between them; and as no attack was yet apprehended, they made no ſcruple to penetrate farther into the country. In two days they arrived at the village of Matignon, having had ſeveral ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes with ſmall bodies of the enemy, who from time to time appeared on their flanks, and who always diſappeared when they were briſkly encountered. By this time the Duke d'Aiguillon, Governor of Britanny, was advanced within ſix miles of the Engliſh army, with a body of twelve battalions and ſix ſquadrons of regular troops, and two regiments of militia. This determined the council of war to retreat; they wanted but three miles to the bay of St. Cas. But in this little march a conſiderable time was conſumed, and the French army was cloſe upon them before they could be compleatly reimbarked. A very ſteep hill formed a ſort of amphitheatre about the bay of St.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1261701201:121"/>
Cas, where the embarkation was making; but before the laſt diviſion, which conſiſted of all the grenadiers of the army, and the firſt regiment of the guards, could get off, the French had marched down this hill, through an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low way, and formed themſelves in a long line againſt the few Engliſh troops that remained. There remained in this exigency only the expedient of aſſuming a bold countenance, and attacking them with vigour. The bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of our troops on this deſperate occaſion, was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a better fortune. The ſhips and frigates ſeconded their efforts, and made a ſevere fire upon the enemy. All was to no purpoſe; their ammunition was at laſt ſpent; the enemies numbers prevailed; our little body attempted to retreat, but they fell into confuſion, they broke, an horrible ſlaughter followed, many ran into the water and met their fate in that element. The ſhore was covered with dead bodies. General Drury was drowned. Sir John Armitage, a young volunteer of great fortune and hopes, was ſhot through the head. Several officers, men of large fortune and conſideration fell. At length the firing of the frigates ceaſed, and the French immediately gave quarter. About 400 were made priſoners, 600 were killed and wounded.</p>
                        <p>In the midſt of this carnage, in the midſt of a fire that ſtaggered the braveſt ſeamen who managed the boats, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore Howe exhibited a noble example of intrepidity and fortitude, by ordering himſelf to be rowed in his own boat through the thickeſt of the fire, to encourage all that were engaged in that ſervice, and to bring off as many men as his veſſel could carry.</p>
                        <p>This affair diſpirited the people of England, and elated the people of France far more than an affair of ſo little conſequence ought to have done. It was in fact no more than the cutting off a rear guard. There is often more bloodſhed in ſkirmiſhes in Germany, which make no figure in the Gazettes. And certainly, if our expeditions to the coaſt of France were planned with any judgment, on our part we had rather reaſon to congratulate ourſelves that we were able to land three times on that coaſt, with ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable a loſs. The French indeed had reaſon to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify this loſs; and they did greatly magnify it in order to conſole their people, who had ſeen their trade ſuffer ſo much, and their country ſo long inſulted with impunity.</p>

                        <p>Admiral Boſcawen with a powerful fleet of men of war and ſeveral tranſports ſailed for Halifax from England. Feb. the 19th. He had the chief command in the expedition againſt Louiſbourg, and in particular the direction of the naval operations. General Amherſt, from whoſe character great things were expected, and who juſtified theſe expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, was to command the land forces. Theſe amounted to about 14000 men, including ſome light troops, fitted for the peculiar ſervice of the country. The whole fleet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 151 ſhips, ſet ſail from the harbour of Halifax. On the ſecond of June they appeared before Louiſbourg. They were ſix days on the coaſt before a landing was found practicable; ſuch a prodigious ſurf ſwelled all along the ſhore, that no boat could poſſibly live near it. The French not truſting to this obſtacle, had drawn intrenchments in every part where it might be poſſible to land, ſupported them with batteries in convenient places, and lined them with numerous infantry. At length the ſurf though violent at beſt,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 8."/> 

 was obſerved to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abated, and the Admiral and General did not loſe a moment to avail themſelves of this opportunity of landing; they made all their diſpoſitions for it with the higheſt judgment. They ordered the frigates towards the enemies right and left, to rake them on their flanks. Then the troops were diſpoſed for landing in three diviſions. That on the left was commanded by General Wolfe, and was deſtined to the real attack. The diviſions in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre to the right, were only deſigned for feigned attacks, to draw the enemies attention to all parts, and to diſtract their defence.</p>
                        <p>When the fire of the frigates continued about a quarter of an hour, General Wolfe's diviſion moved towards the land; the enemy reſerved their ſhot until the boats were near in ſhore, and then directed the whole fire of their cannon and muſquetry upon them.

fire. Many of the boats overſet, many were broken to pieces, the men jumped into the water, ſome were killed, ſome drowned; the reſt ſupported and encouraged in all difficulties, by the example, ſpirit, and conduct of their truly gallant commander, gained the ſhore, took poſt, fell upon the enemy with ſuch order and reſolution, that they ſoon obliged them to fly in confuſion. As ſoon as this poſt was made good, and centre moved towards the left, and the right followed the centre, ſo that the landing was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, though not without much time and trouble, in an excellent order, and with little loſs.</p>
                        <p>The operations of a ſiege are too minute and intereſting to make a detail of them agreeable to readers, who are not converſant in the art military. The operations againſt Louiſbourg for ſeveral days went on very ſlowly, owing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the prodigious ſurf and the rough weather, which made it extremely difficult to land the artillery, ſtores, and inſtruments to be employed in the ſiege; however, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent conduct of the Generals Amherſt and Wolfe, by degrees overcame all the difficulties of the weather, which was extremely unfavourable, the ground which was rugged in ſome places and boggy in others, and the reſiſtance of the garriſon which was conſiderable. The French had five men of war of the line in the harbour, who could bring all their guns to bear upon the approaches of the Engliſh troops. The firſt thing done was to ſecure a point called the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe battery, from whence they might play upon theſe veſſels, and on the batteries on the other ſide of the harbour. General Wolfe performed this ſervice with his uſual vigour and celerity, and took poſſeſſion of this and all the other poſts in that quarter.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 12."/> 

 His fire from this poſt on the 25th ſilenced the iſland battery, which was that moſt immediately oppoſed to his; but the ſhips ſtill continued to bear upon him until the 21ſt of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing month, when one of them blew up, and communicating the fire to two others, they alſo were in a ſhort time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to the water edge. This was a loſs not to be repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the approaches drew near the covered way, and things were in a good condition for making a lodgment in it; the enemies fire was conſiderably ſlackened; the town was conſumed to the ground in many places, and the works had ſuffered much in all. Yet the enemy ſtill delaying to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, gave occaſion to add one brave action to the others,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1261701201:127"/>
which had been diſplayed during the courſe of this ſiege. The Admiral who had all along done every thing poſſible to ſecond the efforts of the land forces, notwithſtanding the ſeverity of the weather, reſolved on a ſtroke, which by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deciſive of the poſſeſſion of the harbour, might make the reduction of the town a matter of little difficulty. He reſolved to ſend in a detachment of 600 ſeamen in boats, to take or burn the two ſhips of the line which remained, and if he ſhould ſucceed in this, he propoſed the next day to ſend in ſome of his own great ſhips, who might batter the town on the ſide of the harbour. This was not more wiſely planned by the Admiral, than gallantly and ſucceſsfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted by Captain L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

 he made himſelf maſter of both theſe ſhips; one he towed off, the other, as ſhe ran aground, was ſet on fire.</p>
                        <p>This ſtroke, in ſupport of the ſpirited advances of the land forces, was concluſive. The town ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the next day.

 The garriſon were priſoners of war, and amounted with the irregulars and ſeamen to 5637.</p>

                                 <p>On the 28th of <hi>May,</hi> I had the good fortune to meet Admiral <hi>Boſcawen</hi> with the fleet and the troops coming out of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of <hi>Halifax.</hi> Lieut. Gen. <hi>Bragg</hi>'s regiment, from the bay of <hi>Fundy,</hi> joined the fleet this day.</p>
                                 <p>The 29th we had fine weather; the ſhips kept well together; the whole conſiſted of 157 ſail. The <hi>Dublin</hi> went very ſickly into <hi>Halifax.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>The 30th the wind blew hard in the afternoon; the ſhips were greatly diſperſed.</p>
                                 <p>The 31ſt the wind ſometimes contrary, obliged us to tack, and it blew freſh.</p>
                                 <p>The 1ſt of <hi>June</hi> Capt. <hi>Rous</hi> in the <hi>Sutherland</hi> came from off the harbour of <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> ſaid, two ſhips had got in the 30th; that there were 13 ſail in the harbour. We ſaw the entrance of <hi>Gabarus</hi> at night.</p>
                                 <p>The 2d it was foggy in the morning; about twelve ſaw <hi>Louiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> and the ſhips in the harbour. The fleet, with about a third 
    <pb n="98" facs="tcp:1261701201:128"/>
    of the troops, anchored in <hi>Gabarus</hi> bay; and this evening, with Brigadiers Generals <hi>Lawrence</hi> and <hi>Wolfe,</hi> I reconnoitred the ſhore as near as we could, and made a diſpoſition for landing in three places the next morning, in caſe the troops arrived.</p>
                                 <p>The enemy had a chain of poſts from Cape <hi>Noir</hi> to the flat <hi>Point,</hi> and irregulars from thence to the bottom of the Bay; ſome works thrown up at the places which appeared practicable to land at, and ſome batteries.</p>
                                 <p>On the 3d moſt of the tranſports came in this morning, all well prepared for landing; but the ſurf on ſhore was ſo great, it was impoſſible to land. This day Brigadier General <hi>Whitmore</hi> arrived from <hi>Halifax,</hi> at which place I have left Col. <hi>Monckton</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. As one Bay was found to have leſs ſurf than the others, a diſpoſition was made to land the next morning in one place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of three.</p>
                                 <p>The 4th the wind and ſurf were ſo very high, Admiral <hi>Boſcawen</hi> told me it was impracticable to land.</p>
                                 <p>The 5th a great ſwell and fog in the morning, and the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral declared it ſtill impracticable to land.</p>
                                 <p>The 6th an appearance of change of weather, in the morning early: I was reſolved to ſeize the firſt opportunity; the ſignal was made to prepare to land between five and ſix o'clock, and at eight all the men were in the boats: The fog came on again, and the ſwell encreaſed during the time the men were getting into the boats, and the Admiral again declared it impracticable to land. I ordered the troops on board their reſpective ſhips, firſt acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the reaſon for ſo doing.</p>
                                 <p>The 7th the weather bad in the morning, in the afternoon the ſwell rather decreaſed, and gave us great hopes of landing at day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break the next morning, for which orders were given: and <hi>Bragg</hi>'s regiment, who were in a number of ſloops, to ſail under convoy, by the mouth of the harbour to <hi>Lorembec;</hi> ſending at the ſame time a proportion of artillery deſtined for the light houſe <hi>Point,</hi> with orders to make all the ſhow they could of land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but not to land till further orders, intending to draw the enemy's attention on that ſide.</p>
                                 <p>From the 2d to this time, the enemy have been reinforcing their poſts, adding to their works, cannonading and throwing ſhells at the ſhips, and making all the preparations they can to oppoſe our landing. Seven tranſports were now miſſing with
    
    <pb n="99" facs="tcp:1261701201:129"/>
    
    troops on board, three of which came in at night. The Admiral gave all neceſſary orders for the frigates to cover our landing.</p>
                                 <p>On the 8th the troops were aſſembled in the boats before break of day, in three diviſions; and Commodore <hi>Durell</hi> having viewed the coaſt by order of the Admiral, and given me his opinion the troops might land, without danger from the ſurf, in the bay on our left, the <hi>Kennington</hi> and <hi>Halifax</hi> ſnow began the fire on the left, followed by the <hi>Grammont, Diana</hi> and <hi>Shannon</hi> frigates in the centre, and the <hi>Sutherland</hi> and <hi>Squirrel</hi> upon the right. When the fire had continued about a quarter of an hour, the boats upon the left rowed into the ſhore, under the command of Brigadier General <hi>Wolfe,</hi> whoſe detachment was compoſed of the four eldeſt companies of grenadiers, followed by the light infantry, (a corps of 540 men, choſen as markſmen from the different regiments, ſerve as irregulars, and are commanded by Major <hi>Scott,</hi> who was Major of the Brigade) and the companies of rangers, ſupported by the <hi>Highland</hi> regiment, and thoſe by the eight remaining compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of grenadiers.</p>
                                 <p>The diviſion on the right, under the command of Brigadier Gen. <hi>Whitmore,</hi> conſiſted of the <hi>Royal, Laſcelles, Monckton, Forbes, Anſtruther</hi> and <hi>Webb,</hi> and rowed to our right by the white <hi>Point,</hi> as if intending to force a landing there.</p>
                                 <p>The centre diviſion, under the command of Brigadier General <hi>Lawrence,</hi> was formed of <hi>Amherſt</hi>'s, <hi>Hopſon</hi>'s, <hi>Otway</hi>'s, <hi>Whitmore</hi>'s, <hi>Lawrence</hi>'s, and <hi>Wharburton</hi>'s, and made, at the ſame time, a ſhow of landing at the freſh water <hi>Cove.</hi> This drew the enemy's attention to every part, and prevented their troops, poſted along the coaſt, from joining thoſe on their right.</p>
                                 <p>The enemy acted very wiſely, did not throw away a ſhot, till the boats were near in ſhore, and then directed the whole fire of their cannon and muſketry upon them. The ſurf was ſo great, that a place could hardly be found to get a boat on ſhore. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the fire of the enemy, and the violence of the ſurf, Brigadier <hi>Wolfe</hi> purſued his point, and landed juſt at their left of the <hi>Cove,</hi> took poſt, attacked the enemy, and forced them to retreat. Many boats overſet, ſeveral broke to pieces, and all the men jumped into the water to get on ſhore.</p>
                                 <p>So ſoon as the left diviſion was landed, the firſt detachment of the centre rowed at a proper time to the left, and followed; then the remainder of the centre diviſion, as faſt as the boats could

    fetch them from the ſhips; and the right diviſion followed the centre in like manner.</p>
                                 <p>It took up a great deal of time to land the troops; the enemy's retreat, or rather flight, was through the rougheſt and worſt ground I ever ſaw; and the purſuit ended with a cannonading from the town, which was ſo far of uſe, that it pointed out how near I could encamp to inveſt it: On which the regiments marched to their ground, and lay on their arms. The wind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and we could not get any thing on ſhore.</p>
                                 <p>The loſs of his Majeſty's troops at landing is, Capt. <hi>Baillie</hi> and Lieut. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> of the <hi>Highland</hi> regiment; Lieut. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> of mine, 4 ſerjeants, 1 corporal, and 38 men killed, 21 were of my regiment, (the grenadiers) of which 8 were ſhot, and the reſt drowned in trying to get on ſhore.</p>
                                 <p>Five lieutenants, 2 ſerjeants, 1 corporal, and 51 men wounded; and of the five companies of rangers, 1 enſign and 3 private killed, 1 wounded, and 1 miſſing.</p>
                                 <p>On the enemy's ſide, 2 captains of grenadiers, and 2 lieutenants, are priſoners; 1 officer killed, and an <hi>Indian</hi> chief: Several men likewiſe killed; and, I imagine, about 70 men taken priſoners: They were ſent on board as faſt as poſſible. By ſome of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners I had intelligence, that M. St. <hi>Julien,</hi> Colonel, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Cove:</hi> That there were 5 battalions in the town, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Bourgogne, Artois, Royal Marine, Cambiſe,</hi> and <hi>Volontaires Etrangers,</hi> with about 700 <hi>Canadians.</hi> The three firſt regiments wintered in <hi>Louiſbourg; Volontaires Etrangers</hi> came there not long ſince with part of the fleet, and <hi>Cambiſe</hi> the night before we landed.</p>
                                 <p>We took from the enemy three 24 pounders, ſeven 9 pounders, and ſeven 6 pounders, two mortars and fourteen ſwivels; all which were placed along the ſhore, to prevent our landing; with ammunition tools, and ſtores of all kinds.</p>
                                 <p>The 9th. Lieut. Gen. <hi>Bragg</hi>'s regiment returned in their ſloops from <hi>Lorembec.</hi> The weather continued extremely bad; the ſurf ſo great, that we could get only ſome of our tents on ſhore in the afternoon.</p>
                                 <p>The 10th the furf ſtill continued, and it was with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty that we got any thing on ſhore.</p>
                                 <p>The 11th the weather grew clear and better, and the light 6 pounders, which I had ordered on ſhore immediately after the
    <pb n="101" facs="tcp:1261701201:133"/>
    troops were now only landed, and ſome artillery ſtores with them.</p>
                                 <p>On the 12th, from intelligence I had received, that the enemy had deſtroyed the grand battery, and called in their out-poſts, I detached Brigadier <hi>Wolfe</hi> with 1200 men, 4 companies of grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, 3 companies of rangers, and ſome light infantry round the N. E. harbour to the <hi>Light Houſe Point,</hi> with an intention to ſilence the <hi>Iſland</hi> battery, and, at the ſame time, to attempt to deſtroy the ſhips in the Harbour; ſending, at the ſame time by ſea, the proportion of artillery, tools, &amp;c. that had been ordered for this ſervice.</p>
                                 <p>I received, this day, a report from Brigadier <hi>Wolfe,</hi> that he had taken poſſeſſion of the <hi>Light Houſe Point,</hi> and all the poſts on that ſide the harbour, which the enemy had abandoned, leaving ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral cannon, which were rendered uſeleſs, tools, &amp;c. and a great quantity of fiſh at <hi>Lorembec.</hi> The weather continued extremely bad; but we got ſome tools on ſhore this night, ſo that, on the 13th. we began to make a communication from the right to the left in front of the camp; and I ordered three redoubts on the moſt advantageous ground in the front. A party of the enemy came out this day towards our camp, but were ſoon beat back by the light Infantry, before two picquets could well get up to their aſſiſtance. We worked at three redoubts in front all night.</p>
                                 <p>The 14th the enemy cannonaded us a great part of the day. The ſurf ſtill continued ſo great, that it was with the greateſt difficulty we could land any thing. The fleet, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Sir <hi>Charles Hardy,</hi> which appeared yeſterday for the firſt time, was in the night blown off to ſea.</p>
                                 <p>The 15th I ſent four more mortars in a ſloop to the <hi>Light Houſe,</hi> but we could not get any artillery landed on this ſhore. At night two deſerters from the <hi>Volontares Etrangers</hi> came in; ſaid they had 5 killed and 40 wounded in the ſkirmiſh on the 13th.</p>
                                 <p>The 16th, the firſt fine weather, we landed 12 days proviſion, and got many things on ſhore, but could not land any artillery.</p>
                                 <p>The 17th I got Colonel <hi>Baſtide</hi> on horſeback, and, with Col. <hi>Williamſon</hi> and Major <hi>M' Kellar,</hi> we reconnoitred the whole ground as far as we could; and Colonel <hi>Baſtide</hi> was determined in his opinion of making approaches by the <hi>Green Hill,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the deſtruction of the ſhips in the harbour, to the <hi>Light
    <pb n="102" facs="tcp:1261701201:134"/>
    Houſe Point,</hi> and the batteries on that ſide. I added two 8 inch mortars and three royals to the <hi>Light Houſe</hi> batteries.</p>
                                 <p>The 18th we had fine weather. Some <hi>Indians</hi> took three of the tranſports men at the bottom of <hi>Gabarus</hi> bay who landed there contrary to orders. The road for the artillery was puſhed on as faſt as poſſible. We got three 23 pounders on ſhore, though the ſurf was great the beginning of the day.</p>
                                 <p>The 19th the batteries on the <hi>Light Houſe</hi> were intended to have been opened this night, but could not be got ready ſo ſoon. <hi>L'Echo,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> frigate of 32 guns, was brought in to-day; had got out of the harbour the 13th at night, and was bound to <hi>Quebec:</hi> By her we have intelligence, that the <hi>Bizane</hi> got out the day we landed, and the <hi>Comette</hi> ſince our arrival off the harbour.</p>
                                 <p>The 20th the <hi>Iſland Battery</hi> and ſhips fired at the batteries on the ſhore, who began their fire this laſt night. The enemy burnt an old ſhip at the bottom of the harbour.</p>
                                 <p>The 21ſt very bad weather, and the ſurf high. The enemy diſcovered us making the road for the artillery, and cannonaded us; threw ſome ſhot into the left of the camp, but did not oblige me to decamp any part. An advanced redoubt towards <hi>Green Hill</hi> was thrown up this night.</p>
                                 <p>The 22d the bad weather continued; we were employed on the road, and getting up a <hi>Block Houſe</hi> on the left by the <hi>Miray</hi> road, to ſecure the communication to the N. E. harbour and <hi>Light Houſe,</hi> and to hinder any parties from going into the town.</p>
                                 <p>The 23d the Admiral aſſured me there were above a hundred boats loſt in landing the troops and proviſions. This day fine weather; and we now have on ſhore twelve 24 pounders, and ſix 12 pounders. The enemy fired a great deal from their ſhipping and <hi>Iſland Battery,</hi> and threw ſome ſhot into the left of the camp. Colonel <hi>Meſſervey,</hi> and moſt of his carpenters, taken ill of the ſmall-pox, which is a very great loſs to the army.

                                 <p>On the 24th the enemy fired on the <hi>Light Houſe Batteries</hi> from the town and ſhipping, and on our advanced redoubt, which was finiſhed, they fired from the town. Colonel <hi>Baſtide</hi> remained fixed in his opinion of advancing by <hi>Green Hill.</hi> We had this

                                 <p>The 25th the cannonading continued night and day: In the evening the <hi>Iſland Battery</hi> was ſilenced; their own fire had helped to break down part of their works: Faſcines and gabions were forwarded to <hi>Green Hill</hi> as faſt as poſſible. All the men employed at work, and making the neceſſary communications. The enemy fired a good deal at our advanced redoubt.</p>
                                 <p>The 26th a ſmall alarm on the left of a party that had advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the town; had got up to the <hi>Block Houſe,</hi> which was not quite finiſhed. They had with them a barrel of pitch to ſet it on fire: The guard on it was not ſufficient to oppoſe a large party; but a detachment was ſent out ſo quick, that they were forced to retreat without effecting their deſign, though two of the men had been in the <hi>Block Houſe,</hi> and they were drove back into the town very faſt. Three hundred pioneers ordered to <hi>Green Hill.</hi> Admiral <hi>Boſcawen</hi> landed 200 marines, and took the poſt at <hi>Kennington Cove,</hi> which is a great eaſe to the army. I deſired of the Admiral four 32 pounders and two 24 pounders to leave at the <hi>Light Houſe,</hi> to keep the <hi>Iſland Battery</hi> in ruin, that with a proper number of men intrenched there, Brigadier <hi>Wolfe,</hi> with his detachment, might be able to come round the harbour, bringing his artillery with him; and to try to deſtroy the ſhipping, and to advance towards the <hi>Weſt Gate.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>The 27th one braſs 24 pounder was loſt in 12 fathom water, by ſlipping off the <hi>catamaran</hi>

                                 <p>The 29th cannonading continued; the frigate fired conſtantly at the epaulement; we purſued working at the road which coſt a great deal of labour: At night the enemy ſunk 4 ſhips in the harbour's mouth; <hi>Apollo,</hi> a two deck'd one, <hi>la Fidelle</hi> of 36 guns, <hi>la Chevre,</hi> and <hi>la Biche,</hi> of 16 guns each, and they cut

                                 <p>The 30th, at night, ſome firing at <hi>Kennington Cove:</hi> The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines thought they ſaw <hi>Indians:</hi> The frigate fired all night at the epaulement, as the men worked in the night time.</p>
                                 <p>The 1ſt of July, the enemy creeped out in the morning to get ſome old paliſades and wood. Brig. <hi>Wolfe</hi> and Major <hi>Scott</hi>'s light infantry puſhed them in with a very briſk fire; and the Brigadier took poſt on the hills, from whence it was intended to try to demoliſh the ſhipping; we marched forward on the right; forced the enemy back to <hi>Cape Noir</hi> with a ſmart fire.</p>
                                 <p>The 2d. the epaulement and road went on heavily, from the extreme badneſs of the ground: The enemy continued their cannonading, and threw ſome ſhells: We ſkirmiſhed all day with parties out of the town.</p>
                                 <p>The 3d, a great cannonading from the town and ſhipping on the batteries. Brig. <hi>Wolfe</hi> was making an advanced work on the right, thrown up at 650 yards from the covered way, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of erecting a battery to deſtroy the defences of the place, it being pretty well on the capital of the <hi>Citadel Baſtion;</hi> and the falling of the ground from this place, towards the works, would hinder diſcovering as much of the works, as would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to do them any conſiderable damage. In the evening the ſea officers thought ſome of the ſhips would try to get out of the harbour. The batteries on the left immediately played on them, but it grew ſo dark they could not continue.</p>
                                 <p>The 4th a great fog; when there were glares of light, the cannonading began; 500 men kept continually making faſcines.</p>
                                 <p>The 5th very bad weather; the epaulement was haſtened on as much as poſſible, it ſwallowed up an immenſe number of faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, coſt ſome men, as the frigate cannonaded on it without ceaſing.</p>
                                 <p>The 6th a ſloop ſailed out of the harbour with a flag of truce to Sir <hi>Charles Hardy,</hi> to carry ſome things to their wounded of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and priſoners.</p>
                                 <p>The many difficulties of landing every thing in almoſt a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſurf, the making of roads, draining and paſſing of bogs, and putting ourſelves under cover, render our approach to the place much longer than I could wiſh.</p>
                                 <p>On the 7th we had very foggy weather; cannonading
    <pb n="105" facs="tcp:1261701201:139"/>
    conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued all day, and a good deal of popping ſhots from the advanced poſts.</p>
                                 <p>The 8th I intended an attack on ſome advanced poſts at <hi>Cape Noir,</hi> but it did not take place. Col <hi>Baſtide</hi> got a contuſion by a musket ball on his boot, which laid him up in the gout.</p>
                                 <p>The 9th, in the night, the enemy made a Sortie where Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier <hi>Lawrence</hi> commanded: they came from <hi>Cape Noir,</hi> and though drunk, I am afraid rather ſurpriſed a company of grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of <hi>Forbs</hi>'s, commanded by Lord <hi>Dundonald,</hi> who were poſted in a <hi>Fleecke</hi> on the right. Major <hi>Murray,</hi> who cammand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three companies of grenadiers immediately detached one, and drove the enemy back very eaſily. <hi>Whitmore</hi>'s and <hi>Bragg</hi>'s gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers behaved very well on this occaſion. Lord <hi>Dundonald</hi> was killed, Lieut. <hi>Tew</hi> wounded and taken priſoner, Capt. <hi>Bontein</hi> of the engineers taken priſoner: 1 corporal, 3 men killed; 1 ſerjeant, 11 men miſſing; 17 men wounded: The Sortie was of five picquets, ſupported by 600 men; a Captain, <hi>Chevalier de Chauvelin</hi> was killed, a Lieutenant wounded and taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner: 17 men killed, 4 wounded and brought off priſoners, beſides what wounded they carried into the town, one of which, a Captain, died immediately. The enemy ſent out a flag of truce to bury their dead, which when over, the cannonading began again. The frigate was ſo hurt, ſhe hauled cloſe to the town; the ſhips fired very much againſt Brig. <hi>Wolfe</hi>'s batteries.</p>
                                 <p>The 10th, the road at the epaulement went on a little better; the enemy fired a great deal, and threw many ſhells.</p>
                                 <p>The 11th, a waggoner was taken off by ſome <hi>Indians</hi> between the block-houſe and the left of the N. E. harbour.</p>
                                 <p>The 12th it rained very hard all night; not a man in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment could have a dry thread on; we made an advanced work to <hi>Green Hill;</hi> at night the waggoner who had been taken, luckily made his eſcape, ſaid, they were 250 <hi>Canadians.</hi> The <hi>Citadel Baſtion</hi> fired very ſmartly.</p>
                                 <p>The 13th, the enemy threw a great many ſhells; we perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our works as faſt as we could; bad rainy weather; the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was at work at <hi>Cape Noir</hi> to hinder us taking poſſeſſion near that point, which is of no conſequence; ſome deſerters came in, ſaid a ſloop of <hi>Miray</hi> got in three days ago.</p>
                                 <p>The 14th, the batteries were traced out laſt night, with an intention to place twenty 24 pounders, divided in four different

                                 <p>The 15th, the cannonading and firing continued; the enemy tried to throw ſome ſhells into camp, ſuppoſed to be intended againſt our powder magazine: At ten at night the <hi>Light Houſe</hi> battery fired ſome rockets as a ſignal of ſhips ſailing out of the harbour

; Sir <hi>Charles Hardy</hi> anſwered it; the frigate got out, and Sir <hi>Charles Hardy</hi>'s fleet got under ſail and went to ſea. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day break, Capt. <hi>Sutherland,</hi> poſted at the end of the N.E. harbour, was attacked, and there was a great deal of firing; the grenadiers of Brig. <hi>Wolfe</hi>'s corps marched to ſuſtain him, and all the light infantry; it was over before they could get up, and by a deſerter from the enemy, they were only 100 men come from <hi>Miray,</hi> where they left Monſ. <hi>de Boſbiere,</hi> who had, on the other ſide the water, 300 men with boats to paſs. Major <hi>Scott,</hi> with the light infantry, purſued, but could not get up with them. I encamped a corps forward.</p>
                                 <p>The 16th, towards night, Brig. <hi>Wolfe</hi> puſhed on a corps and took poſſeſſion of the hills in the front of the <hi>Baraſoy,</hi> where we made a lodgment; the enemy fired very briſkly from the town and ſhipping.</p>
                                 <p>The 17th, a great fire continued from the town and ſhipping; we reſolved to extend the parallel from the right to the left. The fleet returned.</p>
                                 <p>The 18th, all laſt night the enemy fired musketry from the covert way, and tried to throw ſhells into the camp.</p>
                                 <p>The 19th, I relieved the trenches by battalions, the 14 batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions forming 3 brigades; a ſmart fire from the covert way, the batteries on the left fired againſt the baſtion <hi>Dauphine</hi> with great ſucceſs.</p>

                                 <p>The 22d, two batteries on the right opened with thirteen 24 pounders, and another of 7 mortars, and fired with great ſucceſs; the enemy fired very well from the town for ſome time, and threw their ſhells into our works. Our ſhells put the citadel in flames. I ordered Col. <hi>Williamſon</hi> to confine his fire as much as he could to the defences of the place, that we might not deſtroy the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. A Lt. of the <hi>Royal Americans,</hi> going his rounds on an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced poſt, loſt his way, and was taken priſoner near <hi>Cape Noir.</hi> A battery was begun on the left for four 24 pounders.</p>

The enemy fired all ſorts of old iron, and any ſtuff they could pick up. Col. <hi>Baſtide</hi> was out to-day for the firſt time ſince he received the contuſion. Our batteries fired with great ſucceſs. This night the ſhells ſet fire to the barracks, and they burnt with great violence.</p>
                                 <p>On the 24th, the fire was very brisk on our ſide, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's decreaſed. The Admiral gave me 400 ſeamen to help to work at the batteries, &amp;c. and 200 miners added to a corps of 100 already eſtabliſhed, that we might make quick work of it, and they were immediately employed. The 4 gun battery opened, and another of 5 erecting. One of the men of war in the harbour, the <hi>Bienfaiſant,</hi> fired at our trenches at high-water, and the <hi>Citadel</hi> and <hi>Bafiion Dauphine</hi> fired againſt the 4 gun bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; but our men firing ſmall arms into the embrazures, beat the enemy off their guns.</p>
                                 <p>The 25th, the batteries fired with great ſucceſs. The Admiral ſent me word, he intended to ſend in boats with 600 men, to take or deſtroy the <hi>Prudent</hi> and the <hi>Bienfaiſant</hi> in the harbour. I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all the batteries at night to fire into the works as much as poſſible, to keep the enemy's attention to the land. The miners and workmen went on very well with their approaches to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered way, though they had a continued and very ſmart fire from it, and grape ſhot, and all ſorts of old iron from the guns of the ramparts. We continued our fire without ceaſing, and a <hi>Ricochet:</hi> The boats got to the ſhips at one in the morning, and took them both: they were obliged to burn the <hi>Prudent</hi> as ſhe was aground, and they towed off the <hi>Bienfaiſant</hi> to the N.

proceeded in four columns to Ticonderoga. As the country through which their march lay was difficult and woody, and the guides which conducted the march to this unknown country, were extremely unſkilful, the troops were bewildered, the columns broke and fell in upon one another. Whilſt they marched on in this alarming diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the advanced guard of the French, who had lately fled before them, was bewildered in the ſame manner; and in the ſame diſorder fell in with our forces.

 The fort is ſituated on a tongue of land between Lake George and a narrow gut, which communicates with the Lake Champlain. On three ſides it is ſurrounded with water; and for a good part of the fourth it has a dangerous moraſs in front; where that failed, the French had made a very ſtrong line upwards of eight feet high, defended by cannon, and ſecured by 4 or 5000 men. A great fall of trees with their branches out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, was ſpread before the entrenchment for about an hundred yards.</p>
                        <p>The General cauſed the ground to be reconnoitred; and the engineer made ſo favourable a report of the weakneſs of the entrenchment, that it appeared practicable to force it by muſquetry alone.

They were confirmed in this precipitate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, by a rumour that a body of 3000 men were on their march to join the French at Ticonderoga, and very ſhortly expected to arrive.</p>

the ſtrength of the enemies lines which had been ſo little foreſeen, was but too ſeverely felt. Although the troops behaved with the utmoſt ſpirit and gallantry, they ſuffered ſo terribly in their approaches, and made ſo little impreſſion on the entrenchment, that the General ſeeing their reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and obſtinate efforts fail of ſucceſs, being upwards of four hours expoſed to a moſt terrible fire, thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to order a retreat, to ſave the remains of the army.

                              <p>At five in the evening, reached <hi>Sabbath Day Points</hi> (25 miles down the Lake) where we halted till ten, then got under way again, and proceeded to the landing place (a cove leading to the <hi>French</hi> advanced guard) which we reached early next morning the 6th.</p>
                              <p>Upon our arrival, ſent out a reconnoitring party; and having met with no oppoſition, landed the troops, formed them in four columns, regulars in the centre, and provincials on the flanks, and marched toward the enemy's advanced guard, compoſed of one battalion, poſted on a logged camp, which, upon our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach they deſerted, firſt ſetting fire to their tents, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing they could; but as their retreat was very precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, they left ſeveral things behind, which they had not time either to burn or carry off. In this camp we likewiſe found one priſoner and a dead man.</p>
                              <p>The army in the foregoing order continued their march through

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1261701201:153"/>
there, after deſtroying the mill and breaking down their bridge, had retired ſome time before.</p>
                              <p>Lieut. Col. <hi>Bradſtreet</hi> having laid another bridge a croſs, and having ſent me notice of his being in poſſeſſion of that ground, I accordingly marched thither with the troops, and we took up our quarters there that night.</p>
                              <p>The priſoners we had taken being unanimous in their reports, that the <hi>French</hi> had eight battalions, ſome <hi>Canadians</hi> and colony troops, in all about 6000, encamped before their fort, who were intrenching themſelves, and throwing up a breaſt-work, and that they expected a reinforcement of 3000 <hi>Canadians,</hi> beſides <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who had been detached under the command of Monſ. <hi>de Levy,</hi> to make a diverſion on the ſide of the <hi>Mohawk</hi> river; but upon intelligence of our preparations and near approach, had been repeatedly recalled, and was hourly expected; it was thought moſt adviſeable to loſe no time in making the attack; wherefore early in the morning of the 8th, I ſent Mr. <hi>Clerk,</hi> the engineer, acroſs the river on the oppoſite ſide of the fort, in order to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitre the enemy's intrenchments.</p>
                              <p>Upon his return, and favourable report of the practicability of carrying thoſe works, if attacked before they were finiſhed, it was agreed to ſtorm them that very day: Accordingly the rangers, light infantry, and the right wing of <hi>Provincials,</hi> were ordered immediately to march and poſt themſelves in a line, out of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ſhot of the intrenchments; the right extending to <hi>Lake George,</hi> and the left to <hi>Lake Champlain,</hi> in order that the regular troops, deſtined for the attack of the intrenchments, might form on their rear.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Piquets</hi> were to begin the attack, ſuſtained by the grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and by the battalions: the whole were ordered to march up briſkly, ruſh upon the enemy's fire, and not give theirs, until they were within the enemy's breaſt-work.</p>

                        <p>It is very poſſible, that the ſucceſs of Col. Bradſtreet greatly facilitated that of the expedition under Gen. Forbes. The General had had a very tedious and troubleſome march, through a country almoſt impaſſable, very little known, and continually haraſſed on his route by the enemies Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. An advanced guard of this army, conſiſting of about 800 men under Major Grant, had moſt unaccountably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to Fort du Queſne, with a deſign as it ſhould ſeem of reducing the place by a <hi>coup de main;</hi> but the garriſon ſuddenly ſallying out and attacking them warmly on all ſides, killed and made priſoners many of this party, and diſperſed the reſt. This was, however, their laſt ſucceſs; for the body of the army being conducted with greater ſkill and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, baffled all their attempts; ſo that the French being convinced by ſeveral ſkirmiſhes that all their efforts to ſurprize the troops, or interrupt their communication were to no purpoſe, and being conſcious that their fort was not tenable againſt a regular attack, they wiſely aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the place after deſtroying their works;

                                 </opener>
                                 <p>I Arrived here with the ſquadron under my command the 28th of <hi>December</hi> paſt in the evening; and the next morning, agreeable to his majeſty's inſtructions, I attacked with the ſhips, the fort and batteries on the iſland of <hi>Goree,</hi> which were ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to aſk to capitulate; and the Governor's demands were, to be allowed to march the <hi>French</hi> troops out of the garriſon with the honours of war. His terms I abſolutely rejected and began a freſh attack; it was, however, but of a very ſhort duration, when the iſland, forts, garriſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſurrendered at diſcretion to his majeſty's ſquadron.</p>
                                 <p>Lieut. Col. <hi>Worge</hi> had his troops embark'd in the flat-bottomed

boats, in good order and readineſs, at a proper diſtance, with the tranſports, to attempt a deſcent, when it ſhould be found practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable or requiſite.</p>
                                 <p>Two days after the ſurrender of the iſland, I ordered it to be delivered up, with the cannon, artillery, ſtores, and proviſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the officer and troops Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Worge</hi> thought fit to garriſon the place with; and the colonel is taking all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable pains to ſettle and regulate the garriſon in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and as faſt as things will admit of.</p>
                                 <p>The incloſed, Sir, is the ſtate of the iſland, with the artillery, ammunition, and proviſions, found in the place at its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render.</p>

                                 <p>* The river <hi>Senga,</hi> or <hi>Senegal,</hi> is in one of thoſe channels of the river <hi>Niger,</hi> by which it is ſuppoſed to diſcharge its waters into the <hi>Atlantic</hi> ocean: The river <hi>Niger,</hi> according to the beſt maps, riſes in the eaſt of <hi>Africa;</hi> and after a courſe of 300 miles, nearly due weſt, divides into three branches, the moſt northerly of which is the <hi>Senegal,</hi> as above; the middle is the <hi>Gambia,</hi> or <hi>Gambra;</hi> and the moſt ſouthern, <hi>Rio Grande. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negal</hi> empties itſelf into the <hi>Atlantic</hi> ocean in 16° north lat. The entrance of it is guarded by ſeveral forts, the principal of which is Fort <hi>Lewis,</hi> built on an iſland of the ſame name. It is a quadrangular fort, with two baſtions, and of no inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtrength. At the mouth of the river is a bar; the beſt ſeaſon for paſſing it, is from <hi>March</hi> to <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> or rather from <hi>April</hi> to <hi>July,</hi> becauſe the tides are then higheſt. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> had formerly ſettlements here, out of which they were driven by the <hi>French,</hi> who have engroſſed the whole trade from <hi>Cape Blanco</hi> to the river <hi>Gambia,</hi> which is near 500 miles. The <hi>Dutch</hi> were the firſt who ſettled <hi>Senegal,</hi> and built two forts. The <hi>French</hi> made themſelves maſters of them in 1678. In 1692 the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſeized them; but next year the <hi>French</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took them, and have kept them ever ſince. They built Fort <hi>Lewis</hi> in 1692, and have beyond it a multitude of other ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, extending 200 leagues up the river. The principal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1261701201:163"/>
which the <hi>French</hi> import from this ſettlement are, that valuable article gum ſenega, hides, bees-wax, elephants teeth, cotton, gold duſt, negroe ſlaves, oſtrich feathers, ambergris, indigo, and civet.</p>
                                 <p>At preſent we are obliged to buy all our gum ſenega of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who purchaſe it from the <hi>French;</hi> and they ſet what price they pleaſe on it. But as the trade to <hi>Africa</hi> is now open, by this important acquiſition, the price of this valuable drug, which is ſo much uſed in ſeveral of our manufactures, will be much reduced.</p>

                        <p>From the Eaſt Indies we have this year heard nothing remarkable. It does not ſeem that the French, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great ſtruggle they made to ſend out a ſtrong arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under Gen. Lally, have been in a condition to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe any thing. It is ſaid, and probably with good founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the greateſt part of that force was dwindled away with ſickneſs during the voyage. Our naval force was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted with ſpirit and effect in the Mediterranean. The French found that the poſſeſſion of Minorca could not drive us from the dominion of the Mediterranean, where Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Oſborn gave the enemies maritime ſtrength ſuch blows, as they muſt long feel, and which merited him the greateſt of all honours, to be joined with the conquerors of Louis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, in the thanks of the repreſentative body of their country.</p>
                        <p>The coming year ſeems big with great events. In Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many the affairs of the rival powers of Pruſſia and Auſtria, appear to be more nearly ballanced than at any time ſince the beginning of the war. This force is as great as ever, and their animoſity is no way leſſened. Great ſteps are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to aſſemble powerful armies on the Rhine; whilſt Great Britain has ſent out two conſiderable armaments, one to the Weſt Indies, the other to Africa; the ſucceſs of which muſt go a great way towards determining the iſſue of the war. Other great preparations are alſo making on the part of Great Britain. In the mean time, the Dutch enraged at the captures of their ſhips, make complaints, and threaten armaments. The death of the Princeſs of Orange, which happened at a moſt critical juncture, adds more perplexity to affairs in that quarter. If we look to the ſouthward, the clouds ſeem gathering there alſo. The imminent death of the King of Spain, will be an event fruitful of troubles. In this affair the King of Sardinia, the houſe of Auſtria, and the houſe of Bourbon, will find themſelves concerned; to ſay nothing of the maritime powers. In a word, the flame of war threatens to ſpread in every part of Europe.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>WHOEVER reflects upon the concluſion of the ſeveral campaigns ſince the year 1755, will eaſily perceive that at the end of the laſt, the fortune of the ſeveral powers at war ſeemed more nearly upon a ballance, than it had been at the cloſe of any of the former. The campaign was rather leſs bloody, than that which immediately preceeded it; and it was not concluded with any action of ſuch an eclat, as could greatly raiſe, or depreſs the hopes of any of the contending parties. All parties became more cautious; becauſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came every day more evident, that the fortune of war was not to be decided by any ſingle ſtroke, however conſiderable.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1261701201:166"/>
The prize was reſerved for the player of the ſkilful game; for the moſt attentive patience: for the greateſt depth of reſources. An equality of this kind ſeemed at laſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe Europe ſome repoſe. All ſides might now give and receive honourable and equitable terms; and peace might be ſettled on that footing, on which it has been uſually made, for ſome time paſt, in our part of the world. But the great deſigns entertained by each power; revenge imbittered by the blows which all had felt in their turns, the conſideration of the vaſt expences that fell upon all, and which a peace at that time would have made fruitleſs; even the hopes ariſing from the equivocal appearances of the laſt campaign, eſtranged every court from the diſpoſition to peace. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that there were no terms directly offered by any of the belligerent power; nor did any of the neutral interpoſe their mediation. Beſides theſe, another cauſe operated powerfully; a great event was hourly expected about this time; an event which threatened to involve the Southern parts of Europe in the calamities of that war, that had ſo long waſted the Northern; and which, whenever it ſhould take place, threatened to render the political ſyſtem infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more intricate, and probably to give the war quite a new turn.</p>
                        <p>The late King of Spain, by the force of a conjugal affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rarely ſeen in that dignity, ſince the death of his Queen had been given up to a melancholy, which preyed upon his health, and affected his underſtanding. His death, or incapacity, appeared inevitable within a ſhort time. The King of Naples, Don Carloſs, was next in the order of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. In the treaty of Aix la Chapelle, it had been agreed, that the dutchies of Parma, Placentia and Guaſtalla, ſhould be reſtored to the houſe of Auſtria, in caſe Don Carlos ſhould ever come to the crown of Spain. Theſe countries were at the end of that war, in the hands of the Empreſs Queen, or her allies. Her imperial Majeſty had ſet up a claim to the reverſion of theſe dutchies, on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of iſſue male in the houſe of Farneſe. But the ambition of the Queen of Spain to make all her children Sovereigns, put powerful bars in her way to it. This am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was one of the cauſes which made the laſt ſo general a war. The peace of Aix la Chapelle, which put a period to that war, after ſettling theſe conteſted dutchies as an eſtabliſhment for Don Philip, ſecond ſon to the King of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1261701201:167"/>
Spain, provided, that whenever the event, which we have mentioned above, ſhould take place, that is to ſay, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Don Carlos to the crown of Spain, then the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Naples and Sicily ſhould paſs to the infant Don Philip, and the dutchies which formed his eſtabliſhment ſhould refer to the houſe of Auſtria.</p>
                        <p>The King of Naples, not without reaſon, looked upon this article of the treaty of Aix la Chapelle, as injurious to his rights; accordingly he never acceded to it. No method in this caſe could be ſeen, which might prevent matters from coming to extremities, except the ſituation of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, engaged as ſhe was with a powerful adverſary, who kept her forces ſtrained to the utmoſt pitch. She was in no condition to engage in a new war, however intereſting the object might be. Her ally France, who ſo ineffectually aſſiſted her in Germany, could not probably aſſiſt her with more effect in Italy; ſhe therefore ſeemed to have no other part left, than to acquieſce for the preſent, and wait in ſilence a more favourable opportunity to aſſert her claims. The event of the King of Spain's death has ſince happened. It has produced none of theſe immediate effects which were apprehended; and this probably proceeded from the cauſe which we have juſt now hinted. A dead calm at preſent broods over Italy. But in this tranquility and ſilence there are materials gathering, which may in no very diſtant period burſt in a terrible tempeſt over that delightful country. They are very nearly the ſame that produced the laſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles there, and may not only revive them, but ſpread the horrors of war once more over all Europe.</p>
                        <p>Such were the inclinations of the powers at war at the opening of this year; their ſtrength ſeemed alſo very entire; in particular, the reſources of the King of Pruſſia appeared aſtoniſhing, after the great blows he had ſuffered; and after the advantages he had gained, but gained at ſo high a price. He was ſtill able to ſhew himſelf the father and benefactor, as well as the protector of his people. In the midſt of the devouring waſte of ſuch an expenſive war, from the funds of his oecomony he was enabled to remit the taxes to thoſe parts of his dominions, which had ſuffered from the Ruſſian barbarity; he even advanced money to thoſe which had ſuffered the moſt conſiderably.</p>
                        <p>To take a nearer view of his ſituation, we muſt obſerve, that the whole kingdom of Pruſſia ſtill remained in the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1261701201:168"/>
hands of the Muſcovites. The dutchy of Cleves, together with his other poſſeſſions on the Rhine, could yield him nothing; they were held by the French; but in theſe reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, his ſituation was not worſe than it had been, almoſt from the beginning of the war. He had to ballance theſe loſſes, the rich country of Saxony, which he had twice in one campaign wreſted from the hands of the Auſtrians. Add to this, the renewal of the ſubſidy treaty with Great Britain, on the advantageous terms of the former year. Theſe were undoubtedly great ſupports; and the King ſeemed as entire in power, and more advanced in reputation than ever.</p>
                        <p>But to a more critical examination, things had an aſpect not quite ſo favourable. This appearance was rather ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than entirely ſolid; and whilſt all without looked full and fair, within there was a decay of ſubſtance, and an hollowneſs that rung at the ſlighteſt touch. That incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable body of troops, which at the beginning of the war had given him ſo great a ſuperiority, no longer exiſted in the ſame perſons. If his troops derived advantages from a long ſeries of active ſervice, theſe advantages were equally on the ſide of the enemy. His army had known what it is to be beaten; and it is no wonder, if a ſort of wearineſs and deſpair began to creep upon them, after ſuch an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite train of unrewarded fatigues, when they ſaw that ſo many wonderful exploits had not yet ended the war in their favour. Many of his beſt generals had been killed in battle, or died, or had retired, or were diſgraced. The hoards which he had amaſſed before the war, by this time muſt have been intirely ſpent; his dominions muſt have been greatly exhauſted, both of men and money. Saxony could no longer yield ſuch ſupplies as formerly. The indigence of the ſubdued inhabitants, ſet bounds to the rapacity of the conqueror. The ſubſidy of Great Britain did a great deal; but it could not ſupply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencies on this, and on every other ſide. Theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, probably, made the King of Pruſſia more cautious and dilatory than uſual.</p>
                        <p>The court of Vienna had as great burthens to ſuſtain as the King of Pruſſia, and ſhe had ſuffered much greater blows. That power has a ſtrength, ſomewhat unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and peculiar to herſelf. More deficient in pecuniary funds, than any other great power in Europe, ſhe is better able to ſubſiſt, and to do conſiderable things without them.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1261701201:169"/>
For by a long habit, the whole ſtate is formed to its neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities; and the ſubject is more ready to ſupply free quarter, and to indure military licence than any other. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is abundantly fruitful in all its parts. And whilſt the war is carried on near home, an arbitrary government, operating on ſo extenſive an object, can hardly fail of ſuch reſources, as muſt ſerve an Auſtrian army; which is ſtill paid in a great meaſure, as Tacitus deſcribes the troops of the antient Germans to have been; <hi>they have a plentiful table in lieu of pay.</hi>

                        <p>And indeed it muſt be owned, that there is no Sovereign, who is more highly honoured in his dominions, or obeyed with a greater mixture of love and reverence, by all his ſubjects, than her Imperial Majeſty. So that having a very ample power, very willing obedience, a large territory and many men, not ſufficiently employed in the arts of peace, it perhaps may be gueſſed, in what manner ſhe has been able to ſupply her many and great loſſes, and to continue a war, like the preſent, better than ſtates more abundant in money. She is beſides, and this is a matter of no ſmall conſequence, ſupported by the countenance, the authority, and the forces of the Empire. And ſhe has for her allies the firſt, and moſt formidable names in Europe. In the wars which this power carried on in the laſt, and in this century, though uſually not very ſucceſsful, ſhe has always been the laſt to deſire a peace; though frequently ſlow in her operations, ſhe makes amends by an extraordinary perſeverance.</p>
                        <p>This ſlowneſs could not eſcape general obſervation, in the actions of the laſt year. That the Auſtrians did not play with ſufficient ſpirit, the great game which was in their hands, after the battle of Hochkirchen, and the entry of the Ruſſians into the New Marche of Brandenburgh, ſeems hardly diſputable. Perhaps it was that the court of Vienna, by an error common to many courts, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſo to this, and often fatal to it, interfered too much and too minutely, in the operations of the campaign.</p>
                        <p>It is not impoſſible that the character of Marſhal Daun himſelf, might have had ſome ſhare in this inactivity; a character almoſt in all things the direct reverſe of that of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1261701201:170"/>
his Pruſſian Majeſty. He ſaw that the King, active, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and advantageous, waſted himſelf even by that activity and ſpirit, to which he owed his moſt brilliant ſucceſſes. Should the Auſtrians carry on the war in the ſame ſpirit, they might ſuffer in the ſame manner, without being ever able to equal, much leſs to exceed that great Monarch, in a ſtile of action peculiarly his own. Daun therefore by principle, ſeems to have kept his army from coming to action, in order to oppoſe a ſtrength entire, and recruited by a long reſt, to that of the King of Pruſſia, waſted by the efforts it was obliged to make inceſſantly, and on every ſide. His deſign ſeemed to be, that the iſſue of the war ſhould rather ariſe from the general reſult and concurrence of all the operations, gradually producing a ſolid though a ſlow advantage, than from the effects of a bold, quick, and maſterly ſtroke. In fact, the Auſtrians felt all the benefits, and all the inconveniencies which uſually attend this ſort of conduct, a conduct which probably loſt them Saxony in the laſt campaign, and which has ſecured them the poſſeſſion of what they now hold in that country. The Auſtrians and Pruſſians watched the time and one another, and came very late to action.</p>
                        <p>The court of Peterſburg ſtill adhered to its old ſyſtem, in ſpite of the late ill ſucceſs of her arms, and all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Britiſh miniſter, to withdraw her from her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance. If ſhe had ſome loſs of men, it was the leaſt loſs ſhe could feel: and ſhe thought that whilſt the war was carried on at the expence of others, the reduction of ſo near, ſo dreaded, and ſo hated a rival as the King of Pruſſia, and the opportunity of the forming her troops to ſervice, and perfecting her officers, were objects of conſequence enough to keep her cloſely attached to her firſt ſentiments.</p>
                        <p>The Swedes preſerved likewiſe the ſame connexion; but they continued as before, an inconſiderable, and inglorious part of the war.</p>
                        <p>Holland preſerved her neutrality; but it was a neutrality little reſpected, and indeed in itſelf little reſpectable. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in her councils, attentive only to private intereſts, ſhe diſguſted the Engliſh, and neither pleaſed nor ſerved the French. For ſome of the ſubjects of that republic had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on the trade of France in their bottoms, which ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to frequent captures from the Engliſh men of war and privateers. This prodoced loud complaints in Holland,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1261701201:171"/>
and warm remonſtrances to the court of London. Theſe complaints met with little attention, being in many reſpects but indifferently founded. The affair was drawn out in length, until the diſpute was extinguiſhed by the deſtruction of its object; ſome of the French colonies were reduced, and the trade in the others, grown too ſmall and too hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous to be continued longer with any hope of advantage.</p>
                        <p>The affairs of France and England were partly connected with the general ſyſtem, and partly diſtinct and independent. France perceived that the ſtrength of the Engliſh, and the exertion of that ſtrength, increaſed continually in America; ſhe knew from the natural inferiority of her colonies, and the feeble ſtate of her navy, that ſhe could not in reaſon hope for great ſucceſs in that quarter; for which reaſon, although ſhe ſent a fleet under Monſ.

                        <p>With regard to the firſt object, though it was difficult to attain it, and though if it ſhould be attained, it did not promiſe to anſwer her purpoſes ſo well as the latter, yet it was upon that ſhe chiefly depended. Hitherto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the ſucceſs which France had in Germany, was not at all proportioned to the prodigious efforts which ſhe made; ſhe began to find herſelf much exhauſted. The wants of the French obliged them to pay little reſpect to neutral, or even to friendly powers; ſo that the eſteem and aſſiſtance which they had in Germany, diminiſhed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. They eat up the country, and ſeized on ſuch towns as were convenient to them, without any ceremony: yet freed from all theſe reſtraints, their army had made very little progreſs; their generals had not diſplayed any great abilities, and their army, in itſelf very badly compoſed, was deficient in diſcipline, to a degree which is ſcarcely credible. They kept neither guards nor poſts, nor cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels; a great part of their troops wandered from the camp into the neighbouring towns, and retu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1261701201:172"/>
manner; and all their deſigns were perfectly known in the camp of the allies, where a very different picture was exhibited, with regard to regularity and caution.</p>
                        <p>The French troops have ſeveral eſſential defects in their conſtitution, which prevent them from equalling thoſe of Germany, and other nations. Several regiments are in a manner hereditary in great families, who placed at their firſt outſet at a very high point of military rank, think it unneceſſary to attain the qualifications, which lead others to it ſtep by ſtep. As to the reſt of the officers, as their pay is ſmall and their hopes littl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, few ſtudy the art military, as a profeſſion: they ſerve becauſe it is the faſhion to do ſo, and that it is thought neceſſary to be a gentleman. Thus they diſpatch their buſineſs as a diſagreeable taſk; and having little to loſe in the ſervice, it is almoſt impoſſible to preſerve a due ſubordination. The common m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

And as they are corrupted by the example of their ſuperiors, ſo by their negligence they are left without any reſtraint. The officers do not chuſe to incur the ill will of their men, or to give themſelves trouble, by exerciſing that wholſome ſeverity in which the health and vigour of military diſcipline conſiſt.</p>
                        <p>The German common people are indeed in a ſtill lower ſtate of vaſſalage than the French, and might therefore be ſuppoſed naturally, no better ſoldiers; but their bodies are more robuſt and hardy; their treatment is ſevere and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, their ſubordination is moſt exact, which makes their diſcipline perfect; and Germany is ſo habituated to war, that all the people may be ſaid to be born ſoldiers. Theſe things give the Germans a great ſuperiority over the French; a ſuperiority which was more viſible in this, than in any former war.</p>
                        <p>Theſe defects in their army were increaſed by the low ſtate of their finances, which cauſed their troops to be very ill paid. The French court made ſome attempts to keep up their credit, by changing their former methods of raiſing money. Mr. Silhoute was made comptroller of the finances, and the farmers general were removed from their former employment of finding the ſupplies. New methods were diviſed, which might ſtave off the entire ruin of their finances, until their armies in Germany could ſtrike ſome
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1261701201:173"/>
effectual blow, or their project of an invaſion, which quieted the minds of the people in ſome degree, ſhould be put in execution.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the latter project, France had formerly found that the bare report of ſuch a deſign had ſerved many material purpoſes; but in England things had ſince then, been greatly changed. The threats of an invaſion increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our internal ſtrength, without raiſing any apprehenſions; they in a great meaſure executed the militia act, which hardly any thing elſe could have put in execution; they increaſed the regular troops, both in their number and their ſpecies. England for the firſt time ſaw light horſe and light foot. There reigned in both houſes the moſt perfect and unprecedented union. Among the great men there was no difference that could in the leaſt affect the conduct of the war. The diſpute concerning the preference of the continental and the marine ſyſtem, was entirely ſilenced; becauſe a ſyſtem took place which comprehended both, and operated in both as fully as the warmeſt advocates of either could deſire. Never did England keep a greater number of land forces on foot, on the continent of Europe, in England, in America, when ſhe turned all her power to her land forces only. Never did ſhe cover the ſeas with ſuch formidable fleets, when her navy alone engaged her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Such is the effect when power and patriotiſm unite; when <hi>liberty and order kiſs;</hi> and when a nation ſits with a happy ſecurity under the ſhade of abilities which ſhe has tried, and virtues in which ſhe dares to confide.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE ſeizing of Francfort in the laſt year, by a moſt flagrant violation of the liberties of the Empire, had given the French and their allies the moſt material advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they had acquired in the campaign; for it ſecured to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1261701201:174"/>
them the courſe of the Maine, and the Rhine, and made it eaſy to them to receive every kind of reinforcement and ſupply. It ſecured likewiſe that communication between them, the Imperial, and the Auſtrian armies, and formed that chain, from which they derived no ſmall benefit of mutual ſuccour and concurrence in their operations. Much depended upon their being diſlodged from that poſt; as well with regard to the fortune of his Britannic Majeſty's army, as to that of the King of Pruſſia. Such a ſtroke muſt neceſſarily have the greateſt influence on the events of the whole enſuing campaign. Prince Ferdinand, ſenſible of this, as ſoon as the ſeaſon permitted him to enter upon action, drew his troops out of their cantonments; and at the head of thirty thouſand men, prepared to diſlodge them, before they could receive the ſupplies, of which they were in daily expectation. The reſt of his army, conſiſting of about ten or twelve thouſand men, were left to guard the electorate, and to watch the biſhoprick of Munſter. Some detachments of Hanoverians and Pruſſians had, in the latter end of February, driven the Imperialiſts and Auſtrians from the poſts, which they occupied at Erfurth and Eiſinach, and ſome places in the country of Heſſe; this drew a ſtrong body of the enemy into that part, which puſhed them back; but the hereditary prince of Brunſwick, who led the army of the allies through ways, before deemed impaſſable to an army, defeated them in ſome ſevere ſkirmiſhes; ſeveral places of importance were taken; ſeveral whole battalions were made priſoners, with their officers. The French, alarmed at the vivacity of this beginning, judged it but the prelude to ſomething more deciſive. Accordingly the Duke of Broglio took an advantageous poſt, near Bergen, at a village between Francfort and Hanau, which it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary the Allies ſhould maſter, before they could penetrate to his line. This place he had made his right, and ſecured his flanks and centre in ſuch a manner, that the attack could only be made at that village.</p>
                        <p>In this diſpoſition was the French army when the Allies approached; they formed themſelves under an eminence, and began the attack on the village of Bergen, between nine and ten in the morning with great intrepidity. They were received with a very ſevere fire, which the enemy had prepared for them; they made three attacks in the ſpace of about two hours, and were every time repulſed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="142" facs="tcp:1261701201:175"/>Prince Ferdinand now obſerved that the enemy ſtill kept a good countenance in their poſt, and that his own troops began to fall into ſome diſorder. This able general, who never riſques his fortune on a ſingle throw, began to think of a retreat, whilſt his loſs was yet inconſiderable, and the diſorder of his men eaſily to be repaired. But a retreat in the face of a victorious enemy, was hazardous; and the day was not yet above half ſpent. In this exigence he made ſuch movements, as ſtrongly indicated a deſign of falling once more upon the village, in the enemy's right, and of making at the ſame time a new attack upon their left. Theſe appearances were farther countenanced by a cannonode, on both theſe poſts, ſupported with an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fury. The French deceived by theſe manoeuvres, kept cloſe in their poſts; they expected a new and a lively attack every moment; they returned the cannonade as briſkly as they could; and in this poſture things continued until night came on, when the prince made an eaſy retreat, without diſorder, or moleſtation, and halted at Windeken.</p>
                        <p>In this action the loſs of the allies was about two thouſand in every way: that of the French was by no means leſs conſiderable. The allies indeed ſuffered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their reputation; their countenance through the whole action having been excellent. Prince Ferdinand gained as much honour, and diſplayed as much ſkill, as could have been obtained, or ſhewn upon a more fortunate occaſion. The event however was, in its conſequences, far from indifferent; for the allies having miſſed this blow, the French ſtill kept Francfort, and all advantages which they drew from that ſituation; they had time and means to receive their reinforcements; and they acquired in a ſhort ſpace ſuch a ſuperiority, as obliged prince Ferdinand to content himſelf with acting on the defenſive, for a long time after.</p>
                        <p>The advantages which would have ariſen from another iſſue of that battle appeared more fully, from the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were carrying on the ſide of Bohemia, and which probably were deſigned to concur with thoſe of the prince, in ſome grand and comprehenſive ſcheme. There is no doubt, that the army of the allies, and thoſe of his Pruſſian Majeſty, had determined to act in concert, and had ſettled ſome plan for that purpoſe; and though it ſhould not be diſcovered with equal certainty, what that plan was,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1261701201:176"/>
it may not however be unpleaſant to trace it; as far at leaſt as a reaſonable conjecture, guided by the lights de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the tendency of each operation, may lead us. For if we ſucceed at all, in ſuch an attempt, it diffuſes at wonderful clearneſs over the whole narrative.</p>
                        <p>It is not impoſſible then, that it was deſigned in the firſt place, to keep the Ruſſians at a diſtance, until the latter end of the ſummer, by the deſtruction of their magazines in Poland. That on the other ſide prince Ferdinand ſhould attempt to drive the French towards the Rhine, and to get between them and the army of the Empire; which having thus loſt its communication with the French, prince Henry ſhould ruſh out of Saxony, and fall upon them in Bohemia and Franconia, and cut off alſo their communication with the great body of the Auſtrians. Then the Imperialiſts, would find themſelves ſituated between two hoſtile and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior armies; whilſt in Bohemia, Marſhal Daun would be either obliged to try his fortune ſingle handed, with the King of Pruſſia, or totally to abandon that kingdom, into which it was in the power of the Pruſſians to enter, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite parts at once.</p>
                        <p>The firſt part of this plan was executed with great ſpirit and ſucceſs. So early as the 23d of February the Pruſſian general Woberſnow marched into Poland from Glogau in Sileſia, with forty-ſix ſquadrons, and twenty-nine battalions, where they routed ſome bodies of Coſſacks; and after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtroyed ſeveral immenſe magazines, particularly one at Poſen, ſaid to be ſufficient for the ſubſiſtence of fifty thouſand men for three months, they retured without any loſs into Sileſia, on the 18th of April.</p>
                        <p>As for the ſecond Act of this military drama, it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted with as great ſucceſs, and with ſome advantages more ſtriking than the firſt. Prince Henry commanded the Pruſſian troops in Saxony, which the public accounts called forty thouſand men. He had certain intelligence, that ſome movements, which had purpoſely been made by the King of Pruſſia, had drawn the greateſt part of the Auſtrian troops, which had been poſted as a watch upon Saxony, towards the frontiers of Sileſia, He immediately took ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadtage of this opening, and entered Bohemia in two columns: one marched towards Peterſwade:

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="April 15."/> 

 the other, which was commanded by General Hulſen, made its way by Paſberg and Commottau. The
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1261701201:177"/>
firſt penetrated as far as Loboſchutz, and Leitmeritz, the enemy flying before them, and every where abandoning or burning the vaſt magazines which they had amaſſed in all thoſe parts.</p>
                        <p>The body under General Hulſen did as much ſervice, and it had a more active employment. The paſs of Paſberg, ſtrong in itſelf, was defended by a conſiderable body of Auſtrians. General Hulſen having conducted his cavalry by another way, ſo as to fall directly on their rear, attacked them with his infantry in front, and drove them out of all their intrenchments; one general, fifty-one officers, and no leſs than two thouſand private men, were made priſoners on this occaſion.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="April 22."/> 

 The Pruſſians loſt but ſeventy men killed and wounded They returned into Saxony with hoſtages for the contributions they had exacted.</p>
                        <p>After this fatiguing expedition, the prince gave his troops a few days to reſt, and then led them once more to action. He directed his march through the Voigtland, towards the army of the Empire; they entered Franconia by the way of Hoff; they attacked General Macguire, who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a body of Auſtrians and Imperialiſts. Here they were bravely reſiſted for the whole day; but the numbers and ſpirit of the Pruſſians prevailing, Macguire gladly took advantage of the night to make a retreat, having loſt about five hundred men. A few ſkirmiſhes more decided the fate of Franconia. The army of the Empire retreated, as the Pruſſians advanced, and abandoned the rich biſhoprics of Bamberg and Wurtzburg to contribution. The town of Bamberg ſurrendered upon terms;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="May 16."/> 

 but ſome confuſion happening before the capitulation was compleatly finiſhed, a party of Croats came to blows with a party of Pruſſians, who had by this time poſſeſſion of one of the gates; this was reſented as an infringement of the capitulation. A pretence was given to plunder the place; it was given up to pillage, by order of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for two days, in a very unrelenting and licentious manner. This produced loud and juſt complaints againſt the Pruſſians, and in due time a ſevere retaliation. Prince Henry had puſhed back the army of the Empire, as far as Nuremberg; he had diſabled a great part of the circle of Franconia from giving them aſſiſtance; and thus far he had accompliſhed the objects of his expedition. But as
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1261701201:178"/>
that part of the plan, which Prince Ferdinand was to have executed, had ailed, it was impoſſible on one hand to hinder the French army from ſuccouring that of the Empire, or on the other, to prevent a body of Auſtrians from availing themſelves of his abſence, to penetrate into Saxony. In theſe circumſtances any farther ſtay in Franconia was uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and might be dangerous. His army, loaded with booty and contribution, returned to their old ſituation. The Auſtrians retired into Bohemia at their approach.</p>
                        <p>Appearances were hitherto favourable enough to the Pruſſians: however none of the great ends propoſed by the general plan were fully anſwered. The Ruſſians, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the deſtruction of their magazines, continued their march towards Sileſia. Count Dohna, who had raiſed great contributions and levies in the dutchy of Mecklenburg, was preparing to oppoſe them on the ſide of Brandenburgh; other parties under other commanders, were poſted at thoſe places where their irruption was the moſt apprehended. The approach of this army brought things nearer and nearer to a criſis. The eyes of all Europe were fixed with anxiety and expectation on their progreſs. It appeared the more formidable, becauſe the progreſs of the French arms was very rapid after the battle of Bergen.</p>
                        <p>Prince Ferdinand finding that another attack was not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable, retreated continually. The French poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of Heſſe without oppoſition; they met as little in making their way through the biſhoprick of Paderborn; and whilſt their grand army, under Marſhal de Contades, puſhed the allies in that quarter and on the ſide of Heſſe, M. d'Armentieres was poſted by Weſel, to advance on that ſide as occaſion ſhould require. The condition of the allied army was extremely dubious; whilſt the French increaſed in their numbers and ſpirit. Their new ſucceſs gave them reaſon to hope for a campaign as fortunate as that of 1757.</p>

                        <p>GREAT Britain was not content with the efforts which ſhe had made in Germany: America, the intereſts of which had given riſe to the war, was the object which principally engaged her attention. This was indeed the proper object of her natural ſtrength, and by her ſucceſs in this quarter, ſhe moſt effectually laid the axe to the root of the enemy's naval power, and cut away one great part of the reſources which fed the war. A ſquadron of nine ſhips of the line,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Nov. 1758."/> 

 with ſixty tranſports, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſix regiments of foot, in the end of the laſt year, ſailed for the Weſt Indies, in order to attack and reduce the French Caribbee iſlands. General Hopſon commanded the land forces; the fleet in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition was to be under the orders of Commodore Moore, then in the Weſt Indies.</p>
                        <p>Their firſt object was Martinico, the firſt in reputation of the French Caribbees, the ſeat of government, the centre of all the trade which France carries on with thoſe iſlands; ſtrong both by nature and art. This iſland lies in the 15th degree N. lat. The ſhore is on every ſide indented with very deep bays, which they call Cul de Sacs, and the ſands, only diſcoverable at low water, form in many places a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and almoſt inſurmountable barrier. A lofty ridge of almoſt impaſſable mountains, runs north weſt and ſouth eaſt quite through the iſland; all the ſpace on both ſides is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected at inconſiderable diſtances with deep gullies, through which the water pours down in the rainy ſeaſons, with great impetuoſity. In other reſpects, the iſland is pleaſant and fruitful; well watered, and well cultivated, abounding with plantations and villages all along the ſea coaſt. The two principal places are St. Pierre, and Port Royal; both
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1261701201:180"/>
town conſiderable in this part of the world, for their mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, trade and ſtrength.</p>
                        <p>By this ſhort deſcription may be diſcerned, how deſirable ſuch a conqueſt was, and the difficulties which naturally oppoſed themſelves to it. They were the greater, becauſe at this time there was in the iſland a conſiderable number of regular troops. They have at all times a numerous and well armed militia, not contemptible for their diſcipline, and well ſuited to the ſervice of the country; add to this, that they can bring into the field a large body of negroes, habituated to arms, and in general well affected to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of their maſters.</p>
                        <p>The Engliſh forces landed without oppoſition, on the weſt ſide of Port Royal harbour, aften the men,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Jan. 6."/> 

 of war had driven the enemy from their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and entrenchments. But on their landing, they found that the nature of the country proved a greater obſtruction to their progreſs, than the ſtrength of the enemy. Theſe profound gullies, incloſed by ſteep, and almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular precipices, proved an unſurmountable obſtacle to the regular march of the troops, or the conveyance of cannon. The enemy had broke up the roads; and five miles of ſuch roads, and through ſuch an impracticable country, were to be paſſed before Port Royal could be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by land. The commander, therefore, of the forces, judged the difficulties on the land-ſide inſurmountable; the naval commander held it impoſſible to put the cannon aſhore nearer to the fort. Some jealouſy ſeems to have ariſen. The reſult of the whole was, that the forces were reimbarked on the day of their landing.</p>
                        <p>Very little was done at Port Royal; but it was hoped, that more would be done at St. Pierre. They accordingly ſet ſail for that place; but when they had arrived before it, and examined the coaſt,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19."/> 

 new difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties aroſe, which produced a new deliberation. They determined that the fort could not be reduced, without ſuch detriment to the troops and the ſhipping, that they could afterwards make little uſe of their ſucceſs; and in this they had probably good reaſon. The conduct of the officers afterwards plainly demonſtrated, that no mean views had any influence on their councils; they agreed to abandon their enterprize againſt Martinico. But having been foiled in this their firſt attempt, they
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1261701201:181"/>
reſolved not to return with the diſgrace of having done nothing worthy of the greatneſs of the armament, and the expectation of their country. They conſidered, that the iſland of Guadaloupe was an object, though not of ſuch an eclat, of full as much real conſequence as Martinico; and they knew, that it was neither ſo ſtrong in troops or forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications. Their firſt failure might lead to an advantage, as conſiderable as that which they had miſſed. In purſuance of theſe reſolutions, they ſet ſail for Guadaloupe.</p>
                        <p>The iſland is called Guadaloupe, from a reſemblance which it bears to a chain of mountains of the ſame name in Old Spain. To ſpeak with exactneſs, Guadaloupe is rather to be conſidered as two iſlands, divided from each other by a ſmall arm of the ſea, or ſalt-water river, not above three hundred feet over where it is wideſt. One of theſe iſlands is called the Grand Terre; the other more particularly and by diſtinction, Guadaloupe; they are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a circle about ninety leagues. The firſt is nearly deſtitute of freſh water, and not perfectly cultivated; but it is otherwiſe with Guadaloupe. No part of the world is furniſhed with more or better. No leſs than fifty rivers, in that ſmall circuit, throw themſelves into the ſea; many navigable by boats, for two, ſome even for three leagues into the country. Not to mention the numberleſs ſprings which riſe among the rocks, and, after a thouſand beautiful meanders, loſe themſelves in the larger ſtreams. The firſt accounts which we have of that country, are laviſh in the deſcription of its beauties; and the lateſt agree with them, that no part of the Weſt Indies, perhaps of the world, affords more agreeable and romantic ſcenes. It is full of high mountains; one of which towers far above the reſt, and is a volcano, continually emitting ſmoke and fire. From hence they have conſiderable quantities of ſulphur. They have alſo hot baths, fit for all the medicinal purpoſes in which ſuch waters are uſed. The land in the valleys is extremely fertile; it produces the uſual Weſt India com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, ſugar, indigo, coffee, cotton, and ginger: the mountains abound with game: ſo that there is nothing in the iſland wanting, for the convenience and delight of life, in an air more temperate and ſalubrious than is commonly breathed between the tropics.</p>
                        <p>The French began to plant colonies in this iſland as early as the year 1632. But for a long time this, together with
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1261701201:182"/>
all their other colonies, continued in a languiſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was in the beginning of the preſent century, that they began to emerge. After the peace of Utrecht had given France time to breathe, ſhe turned her attention ſtrongly to theſe iſlands; Guadaloupe partook however leſs of this care than Martinico, and yet, by its natural advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, it does not fall ſhort of that iſland, neither in the quantity, or the goodneſs of its produce; if it does not greatly exceed it in both; as it certainly does in its capacity to receive all ſorts of improvement. The importance of this iſland, until its late conqueſt, was very little known in England. The reaſon was this. By an old regulation, the people of Guadaloupe were forbid to trade directly with Europe, but were obliged to ſend all their produce to Martinico, from whence they had all their European commodities. A ſtrange regulation, to be continued in an age ſo enlightened as this, by a nation ſo enlightened as France.</p>
                        <p>The Engliſh made attempts upon this iſland in 1691, and 1703; but they were neither powerful enough, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted with ſufficient ability to produce any permanent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; the troops waſted the country, and retired with their booty. But on the occaſion, of which we are going to ſpeak, they were more able, ſtrong, and fortunate.</p>
                        <p>On the 23d of January the fleet came before the town of Baſſe Terre, the capital of the iſland, a place of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable extent, large trade, and defended by a ſtrong for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. This fortreſs, in the opinion of the chief engineer, was not to be reduced by the ſhipping. But Commodore Moore, notwithſtanding this opinion, brought four men of war to bear upon the citadel; the reſt were diſpoſed againſt the town, and the batteries which obſtructed the landing. About nine in the morning a fire from all ſides began, which continued with the utmoſt fury until night, when the citadel, and all the batteries, were effectually ſilenced. During this cannonade the bombs, that were continually ſhowered upon the town, ſet it on fire in ſeveral places. It burned without interruption the whole of this and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day; when it was almoſt totally reduced to aſhes. The loſs was prodigious from the number of warehouſes in the town, full of rich, but combuſtible materials. Nothing could be more ſtriking, than the horror of the ſpectacle,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1261701201:183"/>
from the mutual and unremitted fire of ſo many great ſhips and batteries, heightened with a long line of flames, which extended along the ſhore, and formed the back ground of this terrible picture.</p>
                        <p>In this lively engagement, our loſs was very inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The next day the forces landed without oppoſition,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Jan. 24."/> 

 and took poſſeſſion of the town and citadel. Notwithſtanding this ſucceſs, the iſland was far from being reduced. The country is rugged and mountainous, and abounded with paſſes and defiles, of a difficult and dangerous nature. The inhabitants had retired with their armed negroes into the mountains; and all ſeemed prepared to defend their poſſeſſions bravely, and to the laſt extremities.</p>
                        <p>General Hopſon died on the 27th of February, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Barrington ſucceeded him. He embarked part of his forces for the Grand Terre, where Colonel Crump attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reduced the towns of St. Anne, and St. Francois; whilſt this attack diverted the enemy's attention, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fell upon the ſtrong poſt of Goſier, and poſſeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of it; and thus the Grand Terre was in a manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and diſabled from ſending any relief to the other part.</p>
                        <p>There is a conſiderable mountain, not far from the town of Baſſe Terre, called Dos d'Aſne, or the Aſſe's Back; thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a great part of the enemy had retired. It is a poſt of great ſtrength, and great importance, as it keeps a watch upon the town, and at the ſame time forms the only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication there is between that town, and the Capes Terre, the plaineſt, pleaſanteſt, and moſt fruitful part of the whole iſland. It was not judged practicable to break into it by this way; and all the reſt of Guadaloupe was in the enemy's poſſeſſion. Therefore a plan was formed for another operation, by which it was propoſed to ſurprize Petit Bourg, Goyave, and St. Mary's, and by that way to march into Capes Terre, which might be eaſily reduced. But this deſign failing, it was neceſſary to attempt thoſe places by main force. Col. Clavering and Col. Crump landed near Arnonville, and attacked the enemy, ſtrongly intrenched at a poſt, ſtrong by nature, called Le Corne. This was forced; another intrenchment at Petit Bourg had the ſame fate; a third near St. Mary's yielded in the ſame manner. An opening being at laſt made into the Capes
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1261701201:184"/>
Terre, the inhabitants ſaw, that the beſt part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was on the point of being given up to fire and ſword; they came in and capitulated; their poſſeſſions,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="May 1."/> 

 and their civil and religious liberties were granted to them.</p>
                        <p>Three ſmall iſlands, near Guadaloupe, Deſeada, Santos and Petite Terre,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19th."/> 

 ſurrendered a few days after, and on the ſame terms.</p>
                        <p>This capitulation was hardly ſigned, when the French ſquadron under M. Bompart appeared before the iſland, and landed at St. Anne's, in the Grand Terre, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the French Caribbees, with ſix hundred regular troops, two thouſand buccaneers, and a large quantity of arms and ammunition. The capitulation was made at the moſt critical time; for had this reinforcement arrived but a day ſooner, the whole expedition had probably been loſt.</p>
                        <p>Thus came into the poſſeſſion of Great Britain, this valuable iſland, after a campaign of near three months, in which the Engliſh troops behaved with a firmneſs, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and perſeverance, that ought never to be forgotten, Intolerable heat, continual fatigue, the air of an unaccuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed climate, a country full of lofty mountains and ſteep precipices, poſts ſtrong by nature and by art, defended by men who fought for every thing that was dear to them; all theſe difficulties only increaſed the ardour of our forces, who thought nothing impoſſible under commanders, who were not more diſtinguiſhed for their intrepidity and ſkill, than their zeal for the ſervice of their country, and the perfect harmony and good underſtanding that ſubſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. There is nothing perhaps ſo neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire confidence into the ſoldier, as to obſerve that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers have a perfect confidence in one another

                                 <p>I went on ſhore at Fort <hi>Louis</hi> that evening to ſee the Fort, and the works carrying on by the detachment that had already been ſent thither from <hi>Baſſeterre.</hi>

not be made tenable, and kept as a garriſon for his Majeſty's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, on a more circumſcribed plan, though it appeared impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keep it in the preſent extent of out-poſts; it was determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after much conſideration, that from its weakneſs and bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, its being commanded by ſeveral heights very contiguous to it, as well as the great difficulty (I may indeed ſay the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility) of procuring for the preſent, and eſtabliſhing a conſtant ſupply of water, and other more neceſſary things for the ſupport and defence of a garriſon in this part of the world, not to be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. However, Sir, I was, determined to hold it, until ſome future event might convince me what was beſt to be done for his Majeſty's ſervice.</p>
                                 <p>I reflected on the ſtate of the army under my command, and of the little probability there was of ſucceeding in any attempt of reducing the country by the troops I had, without the aſſiſtance of the ſhips of war to cover them in landing. But however I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to make a deſcent on the coaſt of <hi>Grand Terre;</hi> and for that purpoſe I ordered Col. <hi>Crump,</hi> with a detachment conſiſting of 600 men, to go in ſome of the tranſports that carried moſt guns, and endeavour to land between the towns of St. <hi>Anne</hi> and St. <hi>Francois,</hi> and deſtroy the batteries and cannon, which was happily executed with very little loſs.</p>
                                 <p>As I imagined by my ſending Col. <hi>Crump</hi> to attack the towns of St. <hi>Anne</hi> and St. <hi>Francois,</hi> the enemy would be obliged to detach ſome of their troops from the poſt of <hi>Goſier,</hi> I ordered, two days after he ſailed, the only 300 men I had left to be put on board tranſports, and lye off that town; and in the morning of the 29th, I went to reconnoitre the battery and intrenchments, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the enemy appeared leſs numerous than for ſome time before, I made a diſpoſition for forcing them by two different at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks. This was executed the next morning at ſun-riſing, with great ſpirit and reſolution by the troops; and notwithſtanding the fire of the enemy from their intrenchments and battery, both were ſoon carried with little loſs, and the enemy drove into the woods. The troops immediately deſtroyed the cannon and battery, with the town.</p>
                                 <p>This being happily effected, I ordered the detachment to force its way to Fort <hi>Louis;</hi> and, at the ſame time, ſent orders for the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1261701201:187"/>
garriſon to make two ſallies, one to the right, in order to put the enemy between two fires, and the other to attack their lines, as I knew that which I had juſt made would oblige them to ſend troops to oppoſe our paſſage on that ſide. The firſt was made, but the latter, by ſome miſtake, was not executed; which, had it been done, we muſt have inevitably been in poſſeſſion of their lines. The detachment from <hi>Goſier</hi> forced their paſſage with ſome loſs, notwithſtanding a very ſtrong paſs that the enemy were poſſeſſed of, and took poſſeſſion of a battery of three 24-pounders, which would, the next day, have played upon our camp.</p>
                                 <p>Governor <hi>Deſbriſay,</hi> whom I had left at Fort <hi>Royal</hi> in <hi>Baſſeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> having been killed by the blowing up of ſome cartridges that took fire from the wadding of a 24-pounder that was diſcharged from the upper baſtion of Fort <hi>Royal,</hi> at a body of the enemy, on the 23d of <hi>March,</hi> I appointed Major <hi>Melvill,</hi> who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the detachment of the 38th regiment from the <hi>Leeward Iſlands,</hi> to be governor in his room. Major <hi>Trollone,</hi> a lieut. of the 63d regiment, and two private men, were likewiſe killed by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident; and a capt. another lieut. and 3 men wounded: And the parapet of that baſtion levelled with the ground by the explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                                 <p>At the ſame time that I was acquainted with this accident, I was told, that the enemy had erected a bomb-battery, and thrown ſeveral ſhells into the fort; and that they had, for ſome time paſt, been working, as the garriſon ſuſpected, upon another bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; I therefore ordered Govenor <hi>Melvill</hi> to cauſe a ſortie (ſally) to be made from the garriſon in order to deſtroy it. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly a detachment of 300 men ſallied out under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Capt. <hi>Blomer,</hi> on the 1ſt of <hi>April,</hi> and without much difficulty forced the enemy's intrenchments, and got into the work, which proved to be a battery of one 18-pounder, and one 12 nearly compleated. Our people ſpiked the guns, and returned to the garriſon with the loſs of only ſix men killed, and ſix wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                                 <p>As I thought the fort, by this accident, might want the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the chief engineer, I ſent him thither immediately, as well as the commanding officer of the artillery, that no time might be loſt in putting it again in a proper ſtate of defence.</p>
                                 <p>The remaining part of the tranſports, with the troops, being
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1261701201:188"/>
now arrived; nine having come on the 23d of <hi>March,</hi> and the others by one or two in a day; as I had long intended, ſo ſoon as it was in my power to make an attack on the <hi>Gaudaloupe</hi> ſide, as the enemy had there ſome poſts of infinite conſequence, I form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon the information of ſome <hi>Negroes,</hi> who promiſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the troops in flat-bottom boats by night, a deſign of ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Petit Bourg. Guoyave,</hi> and St. <hi>Marie</hi>'s, at the ſame time. The firſt was to be effected by Brig. <hi>Crump,</hi> who, the moment he had made himſelf maſter of it, was to march to bay <hi>Mahaut,</hi> and deſtroy the batteries there, as well as a large magazine of proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that the enemy had collected from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to hinder any more arriving: The latter, under Brig. <hi>Clavering,</hi> after he had ſurpriſed St. <hi>Marie</hi>'s and <hi>Guoyave,</hi> was to march into the <hi>Capeſterre,</hi> and reduce that fine country. The ſucceſs of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not only to me, but to the gentlemen who were to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, almoſt infallible: But the night proved ſo bad, and the <hi>Negroe</hi> conductors were ſo frightened, that they run ſeveral of the boats on the ſhoals, of which that coaſt is full; ſo that tho' Brig. <hi>Clavering</hi> did land with about 80 men, yet the place was ſo full of mangroves, and ſo deep in mud, that he was obliged to return, but not without the enemy's diſcovering our deſign.</p>
                                 <p>This obliged me to attempt by force, what could not be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a ſafer plan: But as I then was laid up in a moſt ſevere fit of the gout in my feet, head, and ſtomach, I ſent Brigadiers <hi>Clavering</hi> and <hi>Crump</hi> to reconnoitre the coaſt near <hi>Arnoville;</hi> and upon their report, I ordered 1300 regulars, and 150 of the <hi>Antigua</hi> volunteers, to land under the protection of the Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich man of war: What happened afterwards, you will ſee by the following letter which I received at <hi>Petit Bourg</hi> from Brig. <hi>Clavering,</hi> on the 25th of <hi>April.</hi>

                                       <p>ON <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 12th of <hi>April,</hi> at day-break, I landed with the troops which you put under my orders, conſiſting of 1300 men, excluſive of the <hi>Antigua</hi> volunteers, at a Bay not far diſtant from <hi>Arnoville.</hi> The enemy made no oppoſition to our
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1261701201:189"/>
landing, but retired, as our troops advanced, to very ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments behind the river <hi>Le Corn.</hi> This poſt was to them of the greateſt importance, as it covered the whole country to the bay <hi>Mahaut,</hi> where the proviſions and ſupplies of all ſorts were land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from St. <hi>Euſtatia,</hi> and therefore they had very early taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it, and had ſpared no pains to ſtrengthen it, though the ſituation was ſuch as required very little aſſiſtance from art. The river was only acceſſible at two narrow paſſes, on account of a moraſs covered with mangroves, and thoſe places they had occupied with a redoubt and well palliſaded intrenchments, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with cannon, and all the militia of that part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. We could only approach them in a very contracted front, which was at leaſt reduced to the breadth of the roads, interſect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with deep and wide ditches. Our artillery, which conſiſted of four field pieces and two hawbitzers, were ordered to keep a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant fire on the top of the intrenchments, to cover the attack made by <hi>Duroure</hi>'s regiment and the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> who, on this occaſion, behaved with the greateſt coolneſs and reſolution, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, as they advanced, a regular platoon firing. This behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſo intimidated the enemy, that they abandoned the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment on the left, into which the <hi>Highlanders</hi> threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſword in hand, and purſued the enemy, with part of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure</hi>'s regiment, into the redoubt.</p>
                                       <p>The enemy ſtill kept their ground at their intrenchments on the right, from whence they annoyed our people very much, both with muſquetry and cannon; and though thoſe who had carried the firſt intrenchments had got into their rear, yet, till a bridge could be made to paſs the river, they could not get round to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack this poſt. This took us up near half an hour; but however we got up time enough to take near 70 of the enemy priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as they were endeavouring to make their eſcape, amongſt whom were ſome of the moſt conſiderable inhabitants of the iſland.</p>
                                       <p>We found in both the intrenchments ſix pieces of cannon. Our loſs was one officer and 13 men killed, and two officers and 52 men wounded.</p>
                                       <p>So ſoon as the ditches could be filled up for the paſſage of the artillery, we proceeded on our march towards <hi>Petit Bourg.</hi> A conſiderable number of the enemy had lined an intrenchment
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:1261701201:190"/>
about half a mile on the left of the road, but when they perceived we were endeavouring to ſurround them, they abandoned it, keeping always about 200 yards in our front, ſetting fire to the ſugar-canes, which obliged us more than once to leave the road, to avoid any accident to our powder.</p>
                                       <p>The troops arrived late on the banks of the river <hi>Lezard,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind which, at the only ford, the enemy had thrown up very ſtrong intrenchments, protected with four pieces of cannon on the hill behind them.</p>
                                       <p>Having reconnoitred the ſide of the river, and finding it might coſt us very dear to force the paſſage at the ford, I therefore kept up their attention all the night by firing into their lines, during which time I got two Canoes conveyed about a mile and a half down the river, where being launched, we ferryed over, before break of day in the morning, a ſufficient number of men to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack them in flank, whilſt we ſhould do the ſame in front: The enemy ſoon perceived their danger, and left their intrenchments with the greateſt precipitation.</p>
                                       <p>Thus we paſſed without the loſs of a man, ſtill purſuing them to <hi>Petit Bourg,</hi> 
which place they had fortified with lines, and a redoubt filled with cannon.</p>
                                       <p>We found Capt. <hi>Uvedale</hi> there, in the <hi>Granada</hi> bomb, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhells into the Fort. The enemy did not remain in it long, when they ſaw our intention of occupying the heights round them, but left us maſters of that, and the Port, with all the cannon round the place.</p>
                                       <p>We halted here the 14th, to get proviſions for the troops.</p>
                                       <p>On the 15th, at day break, Brig. <hi>Crump</hi> was detached with 700 men to the bay <hi>Mahaut,</hi> and at the ſame time Capt. <hi>Steel</hi> with 100 to <hi>Guoyave,</hi> about 7 miles in our front, to deſtroy a battery there. The panick of the enemy was ſuch, that they only diſcharged their cannon at him, and abandoned a poſt that might have been defended againſt an army. He nailed up 7 pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of cannon, and returned the ſame evening to <hi>Petit Bourg,</hi> Brig. <hi>Crump</hi> returned likewiſe the next day with his detachment from the bay <hi>Mahaut,</hi> where he found the town and batteries abandoned. Theſe he burnt, with an immenſe quantity of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that had been landed there by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and reduced the whole country, as far as <hi>Petit Bourg.</hi>
                                       </p>
                                       <pb n="158" facs="tcp:1261701201:191"/>
                                       <p>The heavy rains on the ſucceeding days had ſo ſwelled the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that it was impoſſible for the troops to advance; however, this delay gave us an opportunity of ſtrengthening the poſt a <hi>Petit Bourg.</hi>
                                       </p>
                                       <p>On the 18th in the evening, the <hi>Antigua</hi> volunteers took poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion again of <hi>Guoyave;</hi> they were ſupported early the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a detachment commanded by Lieut. Col. <hi>Barlow,</hi> who had orders to repair the road for the paſſage of the cannon.</p>
                                       <p>On the 20th, after leavin 250 men to guard <hi>Petit Bourg,</hi> the remaining part of the detachment, with the cannon, moved on to <hi>Guoyave,</hi> in order to proceed afterwards to St. <hi>Marie</hi>'s, where we were informed the enemy were collecting their whole force to oppoſe us, and had likewiſe thrown up intrenchments, and made barricadoes on the road to prevent our approach to it. We were not long before we perceived them; but, at the ſame time, we found, as well by our own obſervation, as by the information of the guides, that it was not impoſſible to get into their rear by roads the enemy thought impracticable, and conſequently had guarded with very little care.</p>
                                       <p>A detachment was immediately formed under Col. <hi>Barlow,</hi> for this ſervice, and orders were ſent to haſten the march of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, which, from the badneſs of the roads, had not been able to get up. The firſt ſhot from our cannon, placed very near their intrenchment, with the alarm that was given by our detachment in the rear, made the enemy very ſoon ſenſible of the dangerous ſituation they were in, and indeed their precipitate flight only ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them from being all taken priſoners.</p>
                                       <p>We purſued them as far as the heights of St. <hi>Marie</hi>'s, where we again formed our men, for a freſh attack on the lines and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries there.</p>
                                       <p>Whilſt the barricadoes were levelling for the artillery, we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted a ſecond time to paſs the woods and precipices that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the flanks of the enemy's lines; but, before we could get up our cannon, they perceived our movement, and began to quit their lines to oppoſe it, which made us reſolve, without any further delay, to attack them immediately in front; and it was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly executed with the greateſt vivacity, notwithſtanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant firing of both their cannon and muſquetry. They abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here all their artillery, and went off in ſo much confuſion, that they never afterwards appeared before us.</p>
                                       <pb n="159" facs="tcp:1261701201:192"/>
                                       <p>We took up our quarters at St. <hi>Marie</hi>'s that night, and the next day entered the <hi>Capeſterre,</hi> which is the richeſt and moſt beautiful part of this or any other country in the Weſt Indies. Eight hundred and ſeventy <hi>Negroes,</hi> belonging to one man only ſurrendered this day.</p>
                                       <p>Here Meſſ. <hi>de Glainvilliers</hi> and <hi>Duqueruy,</hi> deputed by the principal inhabitants of the Iſland, met me to know the terms you would grant them; and, as I accompanied them to <hi>Petit Bourg</hi> the next day, and there preſented them to you, it is not neceſſary for me to mention any tranſaction ſince that time.</p>
                                       <p>I cannot, however, conclude, without doing juſtice to thoſe, to whoſe merit is due the ſucceſs that has attended the King's arms on this occaſion; I mean the ſpirit and conſtancy of the troops: To Brig. <hi>Crump,</hi> without whoſe concurrence, I never undertook any thing, but chiefly to yourſelf, Sir, who planned the whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, and who furniſhed me with all theſe means, without which, neither bravery or prudence can little avail.</p>

My ſituation was ſuch, that it was abſolutely neceſſary, that what was done ſhould not be procraſtinated, as I was determined to grant no truce for time enough for the inhabitants to recover from their fears. Mr. Moore was abſent, the thing preſſed, and ſome reſolution was to be taken immediately.

precautions of the Prince proved alſo ineffectual to retard the progreſs of their arms. Ritberg was ſurpriſed, Lipſtadt was blockaded, Minden was taken by aſſault, where a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of 1500 men were made priſoners, and where immenſe magazines fell into their hands. D'Armentieres advanced againſt Munſter; he attempted to take the place by a coup de main. Though foiled in his attempt with conſiderable loſs, he did not deſiſt; he drew up his cannon from Weſel, and after a ſhort ſiege,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 25."/> 

 made himſelf maſter of the city; the garriſon of 4000 men, became his priſoners. Nothing ſeemed able to withſtand the rapid torrent with which the French over-ran the whole country; they no longer hoped, the conqueſt of Hanover; it was with them an abſolute certainty. Elated with the fair appearance of their fortune, they kept no bounds. The French miniſter, the Duke of Bellciſle, in his letters to the Marſhal Contades, ſpeaks only of the means of ſecuring their conqueſt, and preventing another expulſion from Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover; and for this end propoſed the moſt cruel and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable expedients. Nor was there leſs dread and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection viſible on the ſide of the allies, than pride and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence on that of the French. The archives and moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable moveables were ſent off from Hanover to Stade. All things ſeemed haſtening to the ſame poſture which drew on the famous capitulation of Cloſter Seven.</p>
                        <p>In this general gloom that overſpread the fortune of the allies, the Prince kept himſelf unmoved and attentive to his deſigns. He did not ſuffer himſelf to be diſconcerted by blows, which he had probably foreſeen, and the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of which he knew how to prevent. The body of the French army after the taking of Minden, had poſted themſelves near the city, to which the right of their army extended; their left was protected by a very ſteep hill; in their front was a large moraſs; and a rivulet covered their rear. Nothing could be more advantageous than this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and whilſt they continued in it, nothing could be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſed againſt them. The army of the allies, after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued retreat, began at laſt to advance, and fixed their
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1261701201:200"/>
camp altogether as advantageouſly at Peterſhagen, a place about three leagues from the enemy.</p>
                        <p>Things were brought to that paſs, that nothing but a battle could hinder the French from taking winter quarters in the electorate. There was no poſſibility of attacking them with any hope of ſucceſs in the camp which they then occupied. The point was to draw them from that poſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the plain; but the movements neceſſary to effect this were extremely hazardous to an inferior army, in ſight of the enemy. The operations of Prince Ferdinand, on this occaſion, diſplayed ſo penetrating and uncommon a genius, ſuch a guarded boldneſs, ſuch a certainty of the grounds he went upon, ſuch a perfect poſſeſſion of himſelf, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there is no inſtance in hiſtory of generalſhip ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and finiſhed; for which reaſon we ſhall endeavour from the beſt lights we have, to draw out at length the ſeveral parts that concurred to form this remarkable piece; we could indeed wiſh that the authentick accounts of ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry memorable an event, had been more clear and explicit; but we muſt content ourſelves with the materials we have.</p>
                        <p>On the 29th of July, Prince Ferdinand forſook his camp on the Weſer, and marched towards Hillen, a village con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably to his right, with the greateſt part of his army: However he took care to leave on the brink of that river, a body under General Wangenheim; which extended to the town of Thornhauſen, where they were intrenched, and ſupported by a conſiderable artillery. He had the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore detached the Hereditary Prince of Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 28."/> 

 with 6000 men, to make a compaſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the enemy's left flank, and to poſt himſelf in ſuch a manner, as to cut off the communication of their convoys from Paderborn.</p>
                        <p>The French were not inattentive to theſe movements; their Generals immediately held a council of war; and the reſult was, that they gave completely into the ſnare that was laid for them. They ſaw, as they imagined, the allied army divided and disjointed; and now the happy moment preſented itſelf, for the attack of General Wangenheim, who they knew was not ſtrong, and who ſeemed at a great diſtance from the reſt of the army, ſo that it appeared im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that he could be relieved. This body being routed, as it eaſily might, it was obvious that they ſhould then be able to place themſelves between Prince Ferdinand's army
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1261701201:201"/>
and the Weſer, and cut off his communication with that river; the great object at which they aimed, through the whole campaign, and in which was involved the certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the allies.</p>
                        <p>Full of theſe ideas they left their advantageous poſt, and in eight columns paſſed the moraſs in their front,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 1."/> 

 and advanced into the plain. The Duke of Brog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio was to lead the attack, by falling upon that body that lay near the river, which ſeemed to preſent him an aſſured and eaſy victory. He marched on, therefore, with great confidence; but as ſoon as he had gained an eminence which lay along his front, he was ſtruck with the utmoſt ſurpriſe, when, inſtead of a few poſts weakly guarded, he beheld the whole army of the allies drawn up in excellent order, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending from the banks of the Weſer, quite to the moraſs, in the front of the late French camp. This was a ſtroke en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely unexpected; they believed the Prince to have been at Hillen; but he had marched up, and the whole army was joined in the night. This diſcovery for a while put a ſtop to the motions of the French; they were hemmed in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the allies, the moraſs and the river. Their ſituation was diſagreeable, but it was now impoſſible to recede.</p>
                        <p>The allies, finding the French ſlower than they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, began to advance, and threatened the enemy's centre. This was compoſed almoſt wholly of horſe; but it was the flower of their cavalry, who anticipated the ſhock of the allies, and began the engagement. The brunt of the battle was almoſt wholly ſuſtained by the Engliſh infantry, and ſome corps of Hanoverians, which ſtood the re-iterated charges of ſo many bodies of horſe, the ſtrength and glory of the French armies, with a reſolution, ſteadineſs, and expertneſs in their manoeuvre, which was never exceeded, perhaps never equalled. They cut to pieces or entirely routed theſe bodies. Two brigades of foot attempted to ſupport them, but they vaniſhed before the Engliſh infantry. Waldegrave's and Kingſley's regiments diſtinguiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a particular manner this day; nor were their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders leſs di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tinguiſhed. The enemy's horſe, which compoſed their centre, being entirely diſcomfited, and their right, which attacked Wangenheim, having made no ſort of impreſſion, they thought of nothing but a retreat.</p>
                        <p>At this point of time the Prince ſent orders to Ld. George Sackville, who commanded the whole Britiſh, and ſeveral
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:1261701201:202"/>
brigades of the German cavalry, to advance. That caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry formed the right wing of the allies, extended to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs, and if it could have charged at the inſtance of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's retreat, ſuch a ſhock at that time, and in that ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would in all probability have left the French without an army in Germany. But the orders were not ſufficiently preciſe, or they were not ſufficiently underſtood by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh commander; ſo that there was ſome delay in waiting for an explanation. The critical minute paſſed away; the Britiſh cavalry loſt their ſhare in the glory of the action; and the French retreated in ſome order, favoured by the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and well-judged efforts of the Duke of Broglio, and the advantages which the poſſeſſion of Minden gave them.</p>
                        <p>What is remarkable, the French attributed their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in this battle to the ſame error in their diſpoſition, which loſt them the battle of Blenheim; that of compoſing their centre almoſt wholly of cavalry, without any proper ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of foot.</p>
                        <p>The battle was over; but then it was that the effects of Prince Ferdinand's admirable diſpoſitions appeared in their full luſtre. The French not having been moleſted by the Britiſh cavalry in their retreat, had an opportunity of regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their former advantageous poſt. They had, indeed, loſt the honour of the day, and miſſed the ſtroke which they had meditated. They had likewiſe loſt a great number of men. But all theſe loſſes and diſgraces might be repaired, and there ſeemed nothing deciſive in the day of the Minden. It had certainly happened, as it then appeared, if the Prince who foreſeeing this, and neglecting nothing which could be provided, had not formed the plan of detaching away the Hereditary Prince in the manner already related. At five in the morning of that day, this young hero attacked a large body of the French under the Duke de Briſac; this body, though poſted in a moſt advantageous manner, he entirely defeated, and obliged them to take refuge in Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. The news of this blow came with an ill omen to M. de Contades, in the inſtant when the Engliſh infantry began to engage his centre. The enemy himſelf could not help admiring the dexterity of the ſtroke under which he ſunk: and full of aſtoniſhment at a conduct at once ſo daring and judicious, paid the juſt applauſe to a General, who could detach with ſecurity ſo large a body from his army, when
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1261701201:203"/>
he was going to attack an enemy already much ſuperior to him in numbers.</p>
                        <p>This happy ſtroke decided the affair, all the paſſes thro' which the French could draw ſuccour or proviſion, were ſeized. They relinquiſhed their ſtrong poſt; they fled through Minden, and paſſing the Weſer, retreated to the eaſtward of that river; thus loſing all the advantages which they had made in the campaign, and forced to retreat thro' a country different from that through which they had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and in which they had taken no meaſures to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſubſiſtence.</p>
                        <p>The loſs of the French in this action amounted to about ſeven thouſand men killed, wounded and priſoners; among whom were many officers of conſiderable rank. The loſs of the allies was not more than two thouſand. The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, as they gained the greateſt glory, ſo they were the greateſt ſufferers. Twelve hundred of the killed and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were of that nation. The Prince on the day after the battle paid the due honours to theſe illuſtrious corps, as well as to ſeveral of the Hanoverians who had behaved in the ſame gallant manner. He did juſtice to the merit of the officers; he diſtinguiſhed their names; and even particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed ſo low as captains. To ſome in the moſt obliging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he ſent conſiderable preſents; and he omitted nothing to ſhew that he knew what it is to be well ſerved, and how to encourage the troops and officers to do their duty with ſpirit and chearfulneſs.</p>
                        <p>Although the Engliſh had the greateſt ſhare in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this ſignal day, and that the Prince acknowledged their merit in the ſtrongeſt terms, <hi rend="sup">(a)</hi>

                        <p>The news of a victory ſo glorious to our troops, and of a cenſure ſo diſgraceful to their commander, came at once to England. In proportion to the joy which filled all hearts, in proportion to their opinion of the great general to whom they owed ſo ſeaſonable an an advantage, was their indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the unfortunate commander to whom it was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed that this advantage was not greater. The public, as uſual, judged definitively upon the firſt charge. They never pardon a general whoſe error it is to fall ſhort. In vain they are prayed to ſuſpend their judgment, and to wait for a full diſcuſſion; the matter is already decided; they have a fact againſt an officer, and they look upon all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning in his favour, not ſo much a defence of his conduct, as the exertion of eloquence and artifice to palliate a neglect
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1261701201:206"/>
of duty. This indeed makes the caſe of officers particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hard; but then it always ſhews them what they have to do.</p>
                        <p>The merits of the matter are ſtill regarded in the ſame light by the public. But the heat, the eagerneſs, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of the firſt movements being over, the matter will be heard, whenever it comes to be again diſcuſſed with leſs attention, but with leſs paſſion too. It is not for us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver any opinion in ſo nice a controverſy. We have in points of leſs moment hitherto declined it; and we ſhall always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it until the proper judges before whom it probably will come, ſhall have taught us what to think. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no doubt that if the cavalry of the allies right wing, ſituated as it was, had been brought to act at the critical time when it had orders to move, the battle of Minden had proved as deciſive as that of Hocſted. But whether it was a fault in the giving or the delivering of the orders, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was ſome miſapprehenſion in him who received them, we cannot but ſincerely pity a commander of ſuch admirable talents, who by the error or the misfortune of a moment, loſt an opportunity that would have ranked him for ever with the Marlboroughs and the Brunſwicks.</p>
                        <p>A few days after the battle his lordſhip reſigned his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and returned to London. He was but a few days in London when he was deprived of all his military employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Marquis of Granby, whom the opinion of Prince Ferdinand, and the deſires of the whole army had pointed out, ſucceeded him in his command. A generous and ardent courage, an affability of manners that flowed from no artifice, a manly freedom and openneſs of ſoul, a chearful and unreſerved converſation, a munificence that knew no bounds, ſo many qualities of the man and of the ſoldier, endeared him to the whole army, and rendered En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh and foreigners, his inferiors, his equals and his ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or in command, unanimous in his favour.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt theſe changes were making, Prince Ferdinand loſt no time to improve his victory, by the purſuit of the French, who retired in the utmoſt diſtreſs. The allies were not indeed able to overtake the main body of their army, but they nara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

them, obliged them to evacuate that place, and once more freed that poor diſtreſſed country from the French tyranny. The caſtle of Ziegenhayn, after an hour's defence, gave the allies about 400 priſoners. After this the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Prince of Brunſwick,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 23."/> 

 equally conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the greater and the leſſer operations of war,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27."/> 

 made a private march at night in order to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe a corps of French irregulars, commanded by the famous partizan Fiſcher, which were poſted at Wetter, where it was convenient for the allies to encamp. This corps he entirely routed, killing a great number and taking 400. The French threw a garriſon into Marpurg, in hopes of putting ſome ſtop to the rapid career of the allies. In effect this did prove an obſtacle for ſome days, but at length the caſtle ſurrendered, and the garriſon, conſiſting of between 8 and 900 men,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sept. 11."/> 

 became priſoners of war.</p>
                        <p>Here a bound was ſet to the progreſs of the allied arms. Not that they were ſtopped by any conſiderable obſtruction from the main body of the French in that quarter, but from ſome effects in another quarter of the unſucceſsful begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the campaign, from which the battle of Minden had not yet perfectly diſengaged them. Munſter was ſtill behind them, and ſtill in the hands of the enemy, who had a powerful garriſon in that city. M. de Contades, who even after his defeat exceeded the allies in numbers, and had now no further view of an offenſive campaign, ſent a ſtrong body under d'Armentieres, which was reinforced by ſome troops from the Lower Rhine, to near 15,000 men, to cover that place. Prince Ferdinand had before detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed General Imhoff from Caſſel in order to reduce it. On the approach of d'Armentieres, Imhoff was obliged to raiſe the ſiege. But being ſoon after reinforced,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sept. 6."/> 

 the French commander retired in his turn towards Weſel, the poſſeſſion of which place had all along proved of infinite importance to the French in all their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. The ſiege of Munſter was again reſumed, but the buſineſs threatened to be difficult and tedious. This however was the only rub which the allies encountered. In all other reſpects they were perfectly fortunate. They had driven their enemy two hundred miles before them, and at the end of the campaign, after all their efforts, and all their
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1261701201:209"/>
ſanguine hopes of conqueſt, ſet them down juſt where they had begun it.</p>
                        <p>The event of the battle of Minden, and the ſubſequent misfortunes of the French arms, threw Verſailles into the utmoſt confuſion. Ths news of that defeat arrived juſt as the King was taking horſe to hunt. He retired ſilent and dejected into the apartment of Madam de Pompadour, and for ſome time ſaw none of his miniſters. The Duke of Broglio and M. de Contades mutually accuſed each other, for the ill conduct of that day. The public acquitted Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio. Belleiſle and his General Contades loſt all reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but the duke ſtill preſerved his employment and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of his influence at court.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as the firſt confuſion and ſurprize of ſo unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an event was a little abated; it was reſolved to ſend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcements to their army in Germany, and at the ſame time to ſend thither ſome officer of experience and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who might judge, and compoſe, if poſſible, the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which ſubſiſted between the commanders; as well as to aſſiſt in the deliberations for retrieving their affairs. Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic misfortunes call great men from their obſcurity. M. de Etrees was choſen on this occaſion, and inveſted with an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which he unwillingly accepted. When he arrived at the French camp,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sept. 25."/> 

 he could not avoid a ſigh on viewing of the ruins of that army, which had triumphed under his command at Haſtenbeck. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, his behaviour to M. de Contades was polite and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. The old Mareſchal told him that he was not come to take his command, but to ſerve under him; and whilſt he aſſiſted him with his advice, he would receive his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt the French endeavour to piece up their broken fortune in Germany, they made ſome ſhow of puſhing the other part of their ſcheme with vigour. All their ports were full of the preparations for an invaſion of the Britiſh dominions. Men of war, traſports and flat-bottomed boats, now almoſt a word of ridicule, were prepared with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. They talked of a triple embarkation. M. Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot was to command a ſmall ſquadron and ſeveral tranſports from Dunkirk, which it was believed were intended for Scotland. This man from a maſter of a merchant ſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a captain of a privateer, in which capacity he greatly annoyed the Engliſh trade, and acquired a reputation. At
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1261701201:210"/>
a time when France does not abound with great men, his ſervices in this way and his daring ſpirit, recommended him to a command in the King's ſervice.</p>
                        <p>The deſign againſt England, as the voyage hither is the ſhorteſt, was to be attempted from Havre, and ſome other ports of Normandy, in flat-bottomed boats. The third embarkation, which was ſuppoſed againſt Ireland, was to be made from Vannes in the Lower Brittany, where a large body of troops was aſſembled, commanded by the Duke d'Aiguillon governor of that province. This embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kation was to be covered by the fleet under M. de Conflans, which was preparing with great diligence in Breſt. Had this deſign been ſuch as it was repreſented, and had it been put into execution, there is no doubt but ſuch an attempt upon both kingdoms, at three different places at once, muſt have thrown the whole into no ſmall confuſion. But excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meaſures were taken on the part of England to fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate their deſigns, whatever they might have been.</p>
                        <p>A ſquadron under Commodore Boys was ſtationed before Dunkirk. Admiral Rodney was ſent to bombard Havre, which ſervice he performed with ſucceſs. Admiral Hawke blocked up the harbour of Breſt with a ſtrong ſquadron, whilſt a leſſer kept a watch upon that of Vannes. Theſe precautions were continued the whole ſummer, during which time the French proceeded rather ſlowly, but after the battle of Minden had deſtroyed their hopes in Germany, they turned to this object with the greater attention. What iſſue it had we ſhall relate in its proper place. But their firſt attempts on the ocean proved as unſucceſsful as their arms on land.</p>
                        <p>A great fleet was equipped at Toulon, which ſome deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for America, whilſt others believed it was deſigned to unite itſelf with that of Breſt to favour the invaſion. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Boſcawen who commanded in the Mediterranean, blocked up this ſquadron, until ſome unfavourable weather and the foulneſs of his ſhips obliged him to return to Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltar to refit. The French took this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſail out,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 14."/> 

 and they proceeded with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the ſtreights.</p>
                        <p>They had arrived very near Gibraltar before the admiral had notice of their approach; but notwithſtanding that our ſhips were not perfectly prepared to ſail, the admiral uſed
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1261701201:211"/>
ſuch great expedition that in two hours after the account ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived the Engliſh fleet was out at ſea.</p>
                        <p>The Engliſh fleet was compoſed of fourteen ſhips of the line beſides frigates. The enemy had twelve of the line. They were ſuperior in the bulk of their ſhips and in the number of men, if they were inferior in the number of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; and it is the opinion of many perſons of judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if they had formed a line of battle, and fought Mr. Boſcawen in order, they might very well have hoped for a better iſſue of this matter than they found. But the evil genius of France operating on the cowardice or incapacity of their commander, induced them to ſeparate their fleet and fly. The Engliſh ſhips were newly refitted; they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved better ſailors; and the men, animated with the ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed example of their admiral, engaged the French ſhips as they could overtake them; and they overtook ſome of them off Cape Lagos in Portugal. A briſk engagement enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Two of the enemy's ſhips, the Ocean and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtable, were run on ſhore and burned. The firſt was the ſhip of M. de la Clue, the French admiral, who eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to land; but being grievouſly wounded, and, as it is ſaid, having loſt both his legs, he died ſoon after. Two other capital ſhips, the Centaure and Modeſte, were taken.</p>
                        <p>The ſcattered remains of their fleet with difficulty got into the harbour of Cadiz, where they were ſoon after blocked up, and where they ſtill remain. This action hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on the 18th of Auguſt; and it gave a great eclat to the Britiſh arms, which, in the ſame month, had triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo ſignally both by ſea and land <hi rend="sup">(b)</hi>.</p>

                              <p>"I Acquainted you in my laſt of my return to <hi>Gibraltar</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.

                              <p>I got under ſail as faſt as poſſible, and was out of the bay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ten, with 14 ſail of the line, the <hi>Shannon</hi> and <hi>Aetna</hi> fireſhip. At day light I ſaw the <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and ſoon after ſeven ſail of large ſhips lying to; but on our not anſwering their ſignals, they made ſail from us. We had a freſh gale, and came up with them faſt, till about noon, when it fell little wind. About half an hour paſt two, ſome of the headmoſt ſhips began to engage; but I could not get up to the <hi>Ocean</hi> till near four. In about half an hour, the <hi>Namur</hi>'s mizen maſt and both top-ſail yards were ſhot away; the enemy then made all the ſail they could.

I purſued all night, and in the morning of the 19th, ſaw only four ſail of the line ſtanding in for the land, (two of the beſt ſailors having altered their courſe in the night). We were not above three miles from them, and not above five leagues from the ſhore, but very little wind. About nine the <hi>Ocean</hi> ran amongſt the breakers, and the three others anchored.

                        <head>CHAP. V.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>Count Dohna diſgraced. Wedel ſucceeds him. The Ruſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans enter Sileſia. Battle of Zulichau. Ruſſians take Frankfort on the Oder. Gen. Laudohn joins them. King of Pruſſia joins Wedel. Battle of Cunnerſdorf. King of Pruſſia repaſſes the Oder. Soltikoff and Daun communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. King of Pruſſia detaches General Wunſch into Saxony. Parallel of the King of Pruſſia and Prince Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand of Brunſwick.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AS the King of Pruſſia's victory at Roſbach had given the Hanoverians an opportunity to free their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it might be expected that the affair at Minden would
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1261701201:213"/>
have ſerved to free his Pruſſian majeſty from ſome of the numerous armies that oppreſſed him. But as this battle was fought in the middle of the ſeaſon for action, and as Munſter ſtill continued in the poſſeſſion of the French, Prince Ferdinand could not venture at that time, to make any detachment from his army in the King's favour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out riſquing all the advantages which he had obtained from his victory. The King of Pruſſia was therefore left alone to ſtruggle with the Auſtrians, Ruſſians, Imperialiſts, and Swedes.</p>
                        <p>The Ruſſians, whoſe motions governed thoſe of all the other armies, left their camp at Poſna in Poland, and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Viſtula, drew near to the banks of the Oder. They
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1261701201:214"/>
were under the command of a Ruſſian nobleman, Count Soltikoff. Count Dohna, who had been ordered to oppoſe them, ſaw that their numbers were too conſiderable, and their poſts too ſtrong to be attacked with any proſpect of advantage, ſo that he contented himſelf with obſerving their motions, and haraſſing their march. This conduct ſeemed more dilatory and timid than the circumſtances, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the King could bear. He is ſaid to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached that General in ſo ſevere a manner, for a conduct in which he was in all probability very juſtifiable, that he took the firſt opportunity to reſign his command, and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of recovering his health, retired to Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin. The King immediately put General Wedel into his place, with poſitive orders to engage the Ruſſian army at all events. To enable him to obey his commands, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced him with ſeveral detachments from his own army. The poſitiveneſs of the King's orders on this occaſion may perhaps be cenſured; but it muſt be owned, that the time required a courſe next to deſperate. His hereditary domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were in the utmoſt danger, and nothing but ſome great and fortunate ſtroke could effectually prevent the junction of the Auſtrian and Ruſſians armies, an event which, of all others, he had the greateſt reaſon to dread.</p>
                        <p>Fortified in ſome meaſure by the reinforcements he had received, and in conſequence of his orders, Gen. Wedel reſolved to attack the Ruſſians on their march.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 23."/> 

 They had got to Zulichau and directed their courſe to Croſſen in Sileſia, to get before the Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian army, and to make good the paſſage of the Oder. The ſituation of the Ruſſians was very advantageous; poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon eminences, defended by a powerful artillery, and near 70,000 ſtrong. The Pruſſian army fell ſhort of 30,000; and they had greater diſadvantages than their inferiority of number to get over. They had a bridge to paſs, and ſuch a narrow defile to ſtruggle through, that ſcarce a third of a battalion could march in front. The ground was ſuch, that the cavalry could not ſupport their infantry. Yet with all theſe difficulties the attack was long and reſolute. But this reſolution made their repulſe, which all theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages had rendered inevitable, far more bloody and diſtreſsful. Four thouſand ſeven hundred were killed or priſoners: the wounded came to 3000. General Wober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnow, an officer of great ability, was killed, and General
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1261701201:215"/>
Manteuffel was wounded. The Pruſſians were obliged to retire, but they were not purſued, and they paſſed the Oder without moleſtation. The Ruſſians ſeized upon the towns of Croſſen and Frankfort on the Oder.</p>
                        <p>The King of Pruſſia, ſince the beginning of the war, had never hitherto obtained an advantage where he was not perſonally preſent. His preſence now became more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary than ever. Since the action at Zulichau, the Ruſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had penetrated a conſiderable way into his territories, and had taken poſſeſſion of the important city of Frankfort upon the Oder. He therefore marched with 10,000 of his beſt troops, to join the broken army of Wedel, in order to drive this formidable and determined enemy from his country. Prince Henry commanded the remainder of his army, which was too well poſted to fear any inſult during his abſence. The eyes of all were fixed upon his march, and his ſoldiers, who remembered Zorndorf, eagerly long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to try their ſtrength once more with the ſame anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts.</p>
                        <p>M. Daun was not unappriſed of the motions of the Ruſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or the deſigns of the King of Pruſſia. He knew that the great fault of the Ruſſian troops, was the want of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and firm cavalry, which might be depended upon in a day of action. This defect was a principal cauſe of their misfortune at Zorndorf in the laſt year; a misfortune which diſconcerted all the operations of that campaign. As this was the only want which the Ruſſians were under, ſo it was that which Daun was beſt able to ſupply at a ſhort warning. With this view he ſelected about 12,000 of his horſe, and there is no better horſe than that of the Auſtrians, which with about 8000 foot, he placed under the command of Gen. Laudohn, one of the ableſt officers in that ſervice. This body was divided into two columns, one of which marched through Sileſia, and the other through Luſatia. By extreme good fortune and conduct, with little loſs or oppoſition, they both joined the Ruſſian army, and were received with tranſports of joy.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the King of Pruſſia, who was unable to prevent this ſtroke, joined General Wedel at Muhlroſe,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 4."/> 

 and took upon him the command of the united armies. But ſtill finding himſelf too weak for the deciſive action he was preparing to attempt, he recalled General Finck, whom he had ſent ſome time
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1261701201:216"/>
before into Saxony with nine thouſand men, in order to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Imperialiſts in that country. With theſe reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he was not able to raiſe his army to fifty thouſand compleat. That of the Ruſſians ſince the junction of Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dohn, was upwards of ninety thouſand. They had beſides, taken a poſt, which they had ſo ſtrongly entrenched, and defended with ſuch a prodigious number of cannon, that it was extremely difficult and hazardous to attempt them, yet under theſe accumulated diſadvantages, it was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary that he ſhould fight. The detachments from Count Daun's army already menaced Berlin; Saxony, which he was obliged to leave expoſed, had become a prey to the Imperialiſts; and the Ruſſians united with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrians, encamped before his eyes in Sileſia, the beſt and richeſt part of his dominions. In ſhort, his former repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, his preſent difficulties, his future hopes, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of honour and of ſafety demanded an engagement; the campaign haſted to a deciſion, and it was evident that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing farther could be done by marches and choice of poſts. The ſanguine temper of other generals has often obliged them to fight under diſadvantages; but the King of Pruſſia's circumſtances were ſuch, that from the multitude of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, he was neither able to conſult times nor ſituations. Raſhneſs could hardly dictate, any thing which in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, would not have been recommended by prudence.</p>
                        <p>When the attack was reſolved, the King's troops put themſelves in motion at two in the morning, and having formed themſelves in a wood,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 12."/> 

 advanced towards the enemy. It was near eleven, before the action began. The principal effort of the King of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia was againſt the left wing of the Ruſſian army. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan according to their uſual method, with a fierce cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade, which having had the effect he deſired from it, he attacked that wing with ſeveral battalions diſpoſed in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns.</p>
                        <p>The Ruſſian entrenchments were forced with great ſlaughter. Seventy-two pieces of cannon were taken. But ſtill there was a defile to be paſſed, and ſeveral redoubts to be maſtered, which covered the village of Cunnerſdorf. Theſe were attacked with the ſame reſolution, and taken one after another. The enemy made another ſtand at the village, and endeavoured to preſerve their ground there, by puſhing forward ſeveral battalions of horſe and foot;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1261701201:217"/>
but their reſiſtance there, proved not more effectual than it had done every where elſe; they were driven from poſt to poſt, quite to the laſt redoubts. For upwards of ſix hours Fortune favoured the Pruſſians, who every where broke the enemy, with an unparallelled ſlaughter. They had driven them from almoſt all the ground which they had occupied before the battle, they had taken more than half their artillery; ſcarce any thing ſeemed wanting to the moſt complete deciſion.</p>
                        <p>The King in thoſe circumſtances wrote a billet to the Queen to this effect;
<q>Madam, we have beat the Ruſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from their entrenchments. In two hours expect to hear of a glorious victory.</q>
This news arrived at Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, juſt as the poſt was going out, and the friends of the King of Pruſſia throughout Europe, exulted in a certain concluſive victory. Mean time, Fortune was preparing for him a terrible reverſe.</p>
                        <p>The enemy, defeated in almoſt every quarter, found their left wing, ſhattered as it was, to be more entire than any other part of the army. Count Soltikoff therefore aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the remains of his right, and gathering as many as he could from the centre, reinforced that wing, and made a ſtand at a redoubt which had been erected on an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous eminence, in a place called <hi>The Jew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> burying ground.</hi> Nothing was wanting to finiſh matters in favour of the King, but to drive the Ruſſians from this their laſt hope. But this enterprize was difficult. It is confidently ſaid, that the Pruſſian generals were unanimous in opinion, that they ſhould not endeavour at that time to puſh any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the advantages they had obtained. They repreſented to the King, that the enemy was ſtill very numerous, their artillery conſiderable, and the poſt which they occupied of great ſtrength; that his brave troops, who had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for ſo long a time, in the ſevereſt action, perhaps, ever known, and in one of the hotteſt days ever felt, were too much exhauſted for a new attempt; an attempt of ſuch extreme difficulty, as might daunt even troops that were quite freſh. That the advantage he gained would be as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive in its conſequences as that at Zorndorf; and whilſt the enemy filled the gazettes of their party, with frivolous diſputes of the field of battle, he would be reaping, as he did then, all the effects of an unqueſtioned victory. That the enemy would be obliged to retire immediately into Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1261701201:218"/>
and to leave him at liberty to act in other quarters, where his preſence was full as neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>Theſe reaſons were very cogent; and for a few moments they ſeemed to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> ſome weight with the King. But his character ſoon determined him to a contrary reſolution. He could not bear to be a conqueror by halves. One effort more was alone wanting to that victory, which would free him for ever from the adverſary, which had leaned heavieſt on him during the whole war.</p>
                        <p>Once more he put all to the hazard. His infantry, ſtill reſolute, and ſupported by their late ſucceſs, were readily brought to act again. They drew on their bodies fainting with heat and labour to a new attack. But the enterprize was beyond their ſtrength. The ſituation of the enemy was impregnable; and their artillery, which began to be ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to that of the Pruſſians, on account of the difficulty of the ground, which made it impoſſible for the latter to bring up any other than a few ſmall pieces, repulſed theſe feeble battalions with a great ſlaughter. With an aſtoniſhing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, with a blameable perſeverance, the Pruſſian infantry was brought to a ſecond attack, and were a ſecond time repulſed, and with a loſs greater than at firſt. Theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts being unſucceſsful, the affair was put to the cavalry. They made redoubled but uſeleſs attacks; the horſes were ſpent, as well as thoſe they carried.</p>
                        <p>It was juſt at that time, when the Pruſſian horſe was waſted by theſe unſucceſsful efforts, that the greateſt part of the Ruſſian, and the whole body of the Auſtrian cavalry, which had been hitherto quite inactive, and which was therefore quite freſh, ruſhed down upon them, broke them to pieces, forced them back upon their foot, and threw the whole into irreparable diſorder. The whole army was ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a panic; and in a few minutes thoſe troops, ſo lately victorious and irreſiſtable, were totally diſperſed and defeated. The King did every thing to reſtore the field, hazarding his perſon, even beyond his former daring, and prodigal of a life, which he ſeemed to think, ought not to be ſeparated from conqueſt. Thrice he led on his troops to the charge; two horſes were killed under him; ſeveral balls were in his cloaths. The efforts of ſkill, courage, and deſpair, were made, and proved ineffectual; a ſingle error outweighed them all. Scarcely a general, hardly an inferior officer in the army was without ſome wound. That of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1261701201:219"/>
Seidlitz was particularly unfortunate; for to that wound, the failure of the horſe which he commanded, was principally attributed. It was to the ſpirit and conduct of this able officer, that a great part of the ſucceſs at Zorndorf was owing, and the laſt campaign. It is known, that if it had not been for a ſeaſonable movement of the horſe, the whole Pruſſian army had then been in great danger of a defeat.</p>
                        <p>The night, and the prudent uſe of ſome eminences, which were defended as well as circumſtances would admit, preſerved the Pruſſian army from total deſtruction. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this loſs was far greater than any which they had ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the beginning of the war. All their cannon was taken, the killed, wounded, and priſoners, by the moſt favourable accounts, were near twenty thouſands. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Putkammer was killed on the ſpot. Theſe generals whoſe names are ſo diſtinguiſhed in this war, Itzenplitz, Hulſen, Finck, Wedel, and Seidlitz, were among the wounded; as was the Prince of Wurtenburg, and five ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor generals. The enemy could not have fewer than ten thouſand killed on their ſide. For hardly ever was a more bloody battle.</p>
                        <p>When the King of Pruſſia found himſelf obliged to quit the field, he ſent another diſpatch to the Queen, expreſſed in this manner,
<q>Remove from Berlin with the royal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Let the archives be carried to Potzdam. The town may make conditions with the enemy.</q>
We ſhould in vain attempt to draw the picture of the court and city, on the receipt of ſuch news in the midſt of the joy, which they indulged for that which they had received but a few hours before. The terror was increaſed by the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct relation that ſoon followed, which gave them only to underſtand, that their army was totally routed; that there was no account of the King, and that a Ruſſian army was advancing to take poſſeſſion of their city.</p>
                        <p>The day after the battle, the King of Pruſſia repaſſed the Oder, and encamped at Retwein. From thence he moved to Fuſtenwalde, and placed himſelf in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the Ruſſians did not venture to make any attempt upon Berlin. He continually watched their army; a part of which, inſtead of turning towards Brandenburgh, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Luſatia, where it joined that of the Auſtrians. Here the victorious General Soltikoff, for the firſt time, met M.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1261701201:220"/>
Daun, and amidſt rejoicings and congratulations, conſulted about the meaſures for improving their ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>The Ruſſian and Auſtrian armies thus united, ſcarce ſeemed from their ſtrength and their victories, to have any other deliberation left, than of what part of the Pruſſian dominions they ſhould take poſſeſſion. The King was twice defeated with a vaſt loſs. He was cut off from all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the army of his brother Prince Henry; yet to the aſtoniſhment of all the world, the ſuperior, the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and united army acted upon the defenſive, and were curbed in all their motions, and fruſtrated in all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, by the inferior, the beated and divided. Nothing ever ſhewed the genius of the King of Pruſſia more fully, than his conduct after the battle of Cunnerſdorf. In a few days after ſo terrible a defeat, every thing was in order in his camp. He ſupplied the loſs of his artillery from his ſtores in Berlin. He recalled General Kleiſt, with about five thouſand men from Pomerania; in preſence of two ſuch armies as thoſe, of M. Daun and Count Soltikoff, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached ſix thouſand men from his ſmall body, to the relief of Saxony, where the army of the Empire had availed itſelf of his abſence, to reduce the whole country. Hall, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg, Leipſic, Torgau, and at laſt Dreſden itſelf, had opened their gates to the Imperialiſts. With the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his troops, he put himſelf between the Ruſſians and Great Glogau, covered that city, which was the object of the enemy's deſigns, and ſaw them ſoon after, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their two victories, obliged to return again into Poland; and to leave him free for the reſt of the campaign.</p>
                        <p>What was done by the King of Pruſſia ſince that time, will be the ſubject of another chapter; after we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the proceedings of the Engliſh and French in America, to which the order of time directs our preſent attention. But we cannot diſmiſs the affairs of Germany, in which two ſuch battles as thoſe of Minden and Cunnerſdorf were fought, with events ſo different for the common cauſe, without obſerving ſomething concerning the two generals who conducted them.</p>
                        <p>They are certainly in reputation the firſt in Europe, which probably never produced two greater men; though they differ as much in their characters, and in the kind of talents they poſſeſs, as they agree in the greatneſs of their abilities for war. The King of Pruſſia, rapid, vehement,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1261701201:221"/>
impatient, often gives deciſive blows; but he often miſſes his ſtroke, and wounds himſelf. Prince Ferdinand is cool, deliberate, exact, and guarded; he ſees every poſſible ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, he takes it at the moment, purſues it as far as it will go; but never attempts to puſh it farther. Nothing in the man diſturbs the commander. In him, we do not ſee a perſon who is a great ſoldier; it is the idea of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect General; it is a general in the abſtract. Ferdinand ſuffers his temper to be guided by his buſineſs. He never precipitates matters; he takes them in their order and their courſe, and truſts nothing to fortune. The King on the other hand, leads, and even forces circumſtances; he does not endeavour to remove but to over-leap obſtacles; he puts all to the riſque; and by ſuffering Fortune to play her part in his deſigns, he acquires a ſplendor and eclat in his actions, which mere wiſdom could never give him. Prince Ferdinand is famous for never committing a fault. The King of Pruſſia is above all the world, in repairing thoſe he has committed. Like ſome of the great maſters in writing, when ever he makes, or ſeems to make a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, it is a ſignal to the obſerver, to prepare for ſome great and admirable ſtroke of ſpirit and conduct. His er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſeem to be ſpurs to his abilities. He commits an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, he repairs it; he errs again; and again aſtoniſhes us by his manner of eſcaping. We ſhould often condemn the commander, but that we are always forced to admire the hero.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE theatre of our operations in America, is of ſuch a vaſt extent, that if we had perſevered in the courſe we purſued for ſome time, in attacking but one place at once, the war would inevitably be ſpun out to an extreme length, without bringing on any thing deciſive; and it would have rendered our natural ſuperiority of little uſe, by ſuffering the French to collect, as they had hitherto
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1261701201:222"/>
done, their ſtrength into one ſingle point, which enabled them to contend with us, with a force ſufficient for the ſervice in that country. This year another method was followed. It was propoſed to attack the French in all their ſtrong poſts at once; to fall as nearly as poſſible at the ſame time upon Crown Points, Niagara, and the forts to the ſouth of Lake Erie, whilſt a great naval ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, and a conſiderable body of land forces ſhould attempt Quebec, by the River St. Lawrence.</p>
                        <p>This plan was very adviſable, as it tended to weaken, by diſtracting the reſiſtance of the enemy, and whilſt we adhered to it, it was clearly impoſſible for the French to maintain their ground in any of thoſe places which were attacked, without very weakly defending, or even deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of the others; and if, by the means of ſuch diverſions, any of thoſe places ſhould fall into our hands, the campaign could not be ſaid to be ſpent to no purpoſe. But beſides the end in diſtracting the enemy's defence, there was another propoſed of no leſs conſequence; which was to make a concurrence in all the various operations, ſo that whilſt they divided the enemy, they might mutually ſupport one another.</p>
                        <p>General Amherſt, who commanded the American forces in chief, with the moſt conſiderable body, amounting, in regulars and provincials, to about twelve thouſand men, was to attack Ticonderoga and Crown Point by Lake-George; the reduction of thoſe forts would naturally lay open the Lake Champlain, where, having eſtabliſhed a ſufficient naval force, he was by the River Sorel, which forms the communication between this Lake and the great River St. Lawrence, to proceed directly to Quebec, the capital of Canada. Here he was to make a junction with General Wolfe and Admiral Saunders, who having entered the River St. Lawrence at the oppoſite quarter, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have commenced the ſiege of Quebec, by the time that General Amherſt might find it practicable to join them. It was not doubted, that if this junction could be effected, the reduction of that city would follow of courſe.</p>
                        <p>The third of the grand operations was againſt the fort, near the Fall of Niagara; a place of very great conſequence both in war and in peace. The reduction of this was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Brigadier General Prideaux, under whom Sir William Johnſon commanded the provincials of New York,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1261701201:223"/>
and ſeveral Indians of the Five Nations, who were engaged in our ſervice by the credit that gentleman had obtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their tribes.</p>
                        <p>The object of this operation lay too remote from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to expect, with any great confidence, that they could be aſſiſted by its ſucceſs in any other manner than by weakening the enemy's forces. However it was hoped, that if they ſhould be fortunate enough to take Niagara, early in the ſeaſon, the troops might be embarked on the Lake Ontario, and finding no longer any obſtruction from Fort Frontenac, which was deſtroyed laſt year, might fall down the River St. Lawrence, and poſſibly either make themſelves maſters of Montreal, or by their approach at leaſt, draw ſuch a force to that part, as greatly to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate our deſigns upon Quebec and Crown Point. But if this ſcheme, in addition to its own end, ſhould not facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate either of the other two capital undertakings, it would probably, as it was the moſt important place the French had in that part of the world, draw all the troops they had upon the Lakes to attempt its relief, which would leave the fort, on thoſe Lakes expoſed to a fourth, though infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior expedition, which was made againſt them, under Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Stanwix. In reality, it afterwards had that effect.</p>
                        <p>The army under General Amherſt was the firſt in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Lake George, or, as the French call it, Lake Sacrament, is a long, but in proportion, narrow water, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout forty miles in length, and encloſed on either ſide with marſhy grounds. This communicates by another long and very narrow ſtreight with Lake Champlain. This ſtreight is ſecured at each ſide by a fort; that to the ſide of Lake George, is called Ticonderoga; that to the Champlain Lake, is called Fort Frederick, or Crown Point; both extremely ſtrong in their ſituation; and the former of which had repulſed our troops with a very conſiderable ſlaughter, as has been related amongſt the events of the laſt year.</p>
                        <p>General Amherſt, after he had paſſed Lake George, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived with very little oppoſition from the enemy before Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderoga; at firſt the French made ſome appearance, as if they meant to defend the place; but as they knew the ſtrength of our forces, as they ſaw that the preparations for the attack were making with as much judgment as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and as the enterprize which was preparing againſt Quebec, did not leave them a force ſo conſiderable as they
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1261701201:224"/>
had there in the preceding campaign, they abandoned their fort in the night,

The only loſs of any conſequence which the Engliſh army ſuffered, in making this valuable acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was the death of Colonel Townſend, who was killed in reconnoitring, by a ſhot from the fort. The ſteady bravery, the promiſing genius, and the agreeable manners of this officer, cauſed this loſs to be conſidered as a very great one. They compared this melancholy event with the death of Lord Howe; they remembered how much theſe young ſoldiers reſembled each other, both in their virtues, and in the circumſtances of their fate. Both dear to the troops, and having both loſt their lives on an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition againſt this place.</p>
                        <p>Although the general had reaſon to imagine, that the ſame reaſons which had induced the enemy to abandon their fort and lines at Ticonderoga, would perſuade them alſo to relinquiſh Crown Point; he took all his meaſures with the ſame care, as if he expected an obſtinate defence at the fort, and an attempt to ſurprize him on his march. He remembered how fatal ſecurity had proved to us, in that part of the world upon many occaſions.</p>
                        <p>The French abandoned the fort as it had been foreſeen. The general retired with about three thouſand five hundred men to the bottom of Lake Champlain, and poſted himſelf at the iſland called Iſle du Noix. He was ſtill pretty ſtrong on the lake, having ſeveral armed boats and ſloops, with which he hoped to prevent the progreſs of the Engliſh into the interior parts of Canada. General Amherſt, as ſoon as he had taken poſſeſſion of Crown Point, uſed every endeavour to attain a naval ſuperiority on the lake,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 14."/> 

 and in the mean time began to fortify this poſt, as he had that at Ticonderoga. To this time the French were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally eſtabliſhed in the heart of our territories; ſo that dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a war of three years, we had in effect been only acting on the defenſive. It was on the day on which Mr. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſt took poſſeſſion of Crown Point, that he received the

agreeable news of the reduction of Niagara, by the troops under Sir William Johnſon; and he had the pleaſure and encouragement of ſeeing two of the great objects of the campaign accompliſhed, whilſt he prepared himſelf to co-operate in the accompliſhment of the third, which was to be deciſive of the whole.

A little above the fort, is the cataract of Niagara, which is eſteemed the moſt remarkable in the world, for the quantity of water, and the greatneſs of the fall. This fall would interrupt the commerce between the lakes, but for a road which the French have made up the hilly country that lies up the ſtreight; ſo that there is here a good carrying-place, and not very tedious; for after a portage of about eight miles, you reimbark again, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed without any interruption to the Lake Erie.</p>
                        <p>As the great communication of thoſe who go by water is along this ſtreight, and carrying place, ſo thoſe who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel by land, are obliged to croſs it. The lakes are ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that without a ſomewhat hazardous voyage, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians cannot any otherwiſe paſs from the north-weſt to the ſouth-eaſt parts of North-America, for many hundred miles. The fort of Niagara, thus naturally commands all the Five Nations, and all thoſe Indian tribes that lie to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the lakes, as well as thoſe that are ſcattered along the banks of the Ohio, Ouabache, and Miſſiſippi, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is poſſeſſed by the Engliſh or the French, connects or disjoints the colonies of Canada and Louſiana, protects or lays open our own, and is in all reſpects of ſo much conſequence, that it was the opinion of perſons, the moſt converſant in American buſineſs, that this attempt ought to have been made much earlier; and, that if ſuch an attempt, made at ſuch a time, had ſucceeded, it would have contributed very much to the ſecurity of thoſe parts
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1261701201:227"/>
of our colonies, which were the moſt expoſed, and would have, at the ſame time, greatly facilitated all our offenſive meaſures, and ſhortened the war.</p>
                        <p>From the time that the French were acquainted with this place, they were fully poſſeſſed with an opinion of its importance, both with regard to commerce, and to domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. They made ſeveral attempts to eſtabliſh themſelves here; but the Indians who ſeemed more ſenſible of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences than we were, conſtantly oppoſed it. They guarded this ſpot for a long time, with a very ſevere and prudent jealouſy.</p>
                        <p>But whilſt we neglected, confiding in our ſtrength, to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the friendſhip of the Indians, the French, ſenſible of their weakneſs, omitted no endeavour to gain theſe ſavage people to their intereſts, and they prevailed at laſt, under the name of a trading houſe, to erect a ſtrong fort at the mouth of the ſtreight, on the very beſt harbour, not only on this, but on any of the lakes; an harbour which is ſafe from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very wind, and open for the whole year. A French officer, an able and enterpriſing man, had been a priſoner among the Iroquois for a long time, and having, according to their cuſtom, been naturalized, he grew extremely popular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and at laſt acquired his liberty. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the then Governor of Canada, the plan of an eſtabliſhment at Niagara, and he himſelf undertook to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it. He returned amongſt the Iroquois, and pretending great love for their nation, which was now his own, told them, that he would gladly come to make frequent viſits to his brethren; but it was proper for that purpoſe, that they ſhould allow him to build an houſe, where he might live at eaſe, and according to his own manner: at the ſame time, he propoſed to them, advantages in trade from this eſtabliſhment. A requeſt, which ſeemed a compliment to thoſe to whom it was made, was readily granted. The houſe was built. By degrees this houſe extended itſelf; it was ſtrengthened by various additions; and it grew at laſt to a regular fortreſs, which has ever ſince awed the Five Nations, and checked our colonies.</p>
                        <p>The ſiege of this place had not been long formed, before General Prideaux was killed in the trenches, by the burſting of a cohorn.

 As ſoon as this accident happened, which threatened to throw a damp on the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1261701201:228"/>
an expreſs was ſent to General Amberſt, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attentive to the ſervice, loſt no time to ſend an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of character to command in his place. But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which in the interim devolved upon Sir William Johnſon, could not have been better beſtowed. He omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing to continue the vigorous meaſures of the late General, and added to them, every thing his own genius could ſuggeſt. Reſpected by the regular troops, dear to the provincials, almoſt adored by the Indians, poſſeſſed of that genius for acquiring popularity amongſt all kinds of men, and that verſatile diſpoſition, which we ſo ſeldom ſee united with diſintereſtedneſs and integrity, he employed thoſe talents ſolely for the benefit of his country. The troops, remembering, that it was under that General, the firſt advantage had been obtained over the French, puſhed on the ſiege with ſo much alacrity, that in a few days they had brought their approaches within an hundred yards of the covered way</p>
                        <p>The French were alarmed at the imminent danger of this intereſting place. They therefore collected all the regular troops and provincials, which they could draw from all their poſts about the lakes, and to thoſe joined a large body of ſavages, in order to give the Engliſh battle, and to raiſe the ſiege. The amounted in all to 1700 men.</p>
                        <p>When General Johnſon was apprized of their approach, he ordered his light infantry, ſupported by ſome grenadiers and regular foot, to take poſt on the road to his left, by which the French were to take their route. He placed his Indians on his flanks. Whilſt he took meaſures to receive the French, who came to relieve the place, he poſted a ſtrong body, in ſuch a manner, as to ſecure his trenches from any attempt of the garriſon during an engagement.</p>
                        <p>In this diſpoſition he waited to receive the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

 At nine in the morning the engagement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, by a violent and horrid ſcream of the enemy's ſavages, according to their barbarous cuſtom. It was this ſcream, perhaps the moſt horrid ſound that can be imagined, which is ſaid to have ſtruck a panic into the troops of General Braddock, and was one of the principal cauſes of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, by which our endeavours in America were ſo long fruſtrated; but on this occaſion it had no effect. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy was ſo well received by the troops in front, and by the Indians on their flanks, that in leſs than an hour's time,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1261701201:229"/>
their whole army was ruined. The purſuit was hot and bloody; and it continued for five miles. Seventeen offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were made priſoners, among whom were the firſt and ſecond in command.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 25."/> 

 This action was fought in ſight of the fort; and it was no ſooner concluded it favour of our troops, than the General ſummoned the garriſon to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render; ſending a liſt of the priſoners, and remonſtrating on the ill effects of their holding out longer, particularly with regard to the Indians. The capitulation was ſigned that night. The garriſon, conſiſting of about 600 men, ſurrendered priſoners of war, and were conducted to New York. The fort and ſtores were given up to the Engliſh troops.</p>
                        <p>This was the ſecond very important ſervice performed by General Johnſon in this war, and a ſecond time he had the good fortune to make the commander in chief of the enemy his priſoner. It muſt not be omitted, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this gentleman, that though he was not regularly bred a ſoldier, the moſt compleat officer could not have made more excellent diſpoſitions for the battle, or have conducted the ſiege from the beginning to the end, with a more cool and ſteady reſolution, or with a more compleat knowledge of all the neceſſary manoeuvres of war. The taking of Niagara broke off effectually that communication, ſo much talked off, and ſo much dreaded, between Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada and Louiſiana, and by this ſtroke, one of the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal political deſigns of the French, which gave occaſion to the preſent war, was defeated in its direct and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate object.</p>

If we reckon the maritime force, there is no doubt that we employed a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men againſt Quebec, than againſt the Champlain forts; but the land forces, from ſome cauſe, fell much ſhort of the number originally propoſed, for they did not exceed 7000 men, regulars and provincials, though the original plan intended 9000 for that expedition, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the junction of thoſe under Gen. Amherſt, whoſe aſſiſtance on the occaſion was taken for granted. In this expedition Gen. Wolfe commanded the land forces. The fleet was under Admiral Saunders.</p>

The whole embarkation arrived in the latter end of June in the Iſle of Orleans, a few leagues from Quebec, without any accident whatſoever, notwithſtanding the ill fame of the river St. Laurence, and the reports of its dangerous navigation, probably ſpread for political purpoſes. They landed upon the Iſle of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans, which is formed by the branches of the river St. Laurence. This iſland is about twenty miles in length, and ſeven or eight in breadth, highly cultivated, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording every kind of refreſhment to the ſoldiers and ſailors after their tedious voyage.</p>
                        <p>As this iſland extends quite up to the baſon of Quebec, it was neceſſary to poſſeſs it in order to act againſt the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1261701201:231"/>
town; for the moſt weſterly point of this iſland advances towards an high point of land on the continent, called Point Levi. Both of theſe ſhut up the view of the northern and ſouthern channel, which environ the iſle of Orleans, ſo that the harbour of Quebec appears to be a baſon landlock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon all ſides. The poſſeſſion of both theſe points were neceſſary, as they might be employed either with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt the town, or much to the annoyance of the beſiegers; for whilſt the enemy continued maſters of thoſe, it was impoſſible for a ſhip to lie in the harbour of Quebec. When theſe poſts were poſſeſſed, which was done with little difficulty, the harbour and town of Quebec appeared full to the view, at on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e a tempting and diſcouraging ſight. For no place ſeems poſſeſſed of greater benefits of nature; nor any of which nature ſeems more to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the defence.</p>
                        <p>Quebec, ſays F. Charlevoix, can boaſt of a freſh water harbour, capable of containing an hundred men of war of the line, at one hundred and twenty leagues diſtance from the ſea. It lies on the moſt navigable river in the univerſe. The river St. Laurence up to the iſle of Orleans, that is for about 112 leagues from its mouth, is no where leſs than from four to five leagues broad; but above that iſle it nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, ſo that before Quebec it is not above a mile over. Hence this place got the name of Quebeis or Quebec, which, in the Algonquin tongue, ſignifies a ſtrait.</p>
                        <p>The city is the ſeat of the governor and the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and the ſupreme tribunals of juſtice for all the French North America; it is alſo an epiſcopal ſee, and a place of conſiderable trade. It is large in extent, and elegant in many of its buildings both public and private. It conſiſts of an upper and lower town; the lower, which is narrow, is built upon a ſtrand, at the foot of a lofty rock, upon which the upper town ſtands. This rock extends itſelf, and continues with a bold and ſteep front, weſtward along the river St. Laurence for a conſiderable way. Another river from the north-weſt, called St. Charles, falls here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the former, waſhing the foot of the rock on which Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec ſtands; the point on which the town is built, thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a ſort of peninſula by the junction of theſe rivers; ſo that whoever attacks Quebec, muſt either make his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches above the town, and overcome the precipice which I have mentioned, or croſs the river St. Charles, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1261701201:232"/>
it upon that ſide. The former of thoſe methods muſt appear to a prudent commander wholly unadviſeable, and the latter extremely difficult. If the former method ſhould be attempted, they would have that dangerous precipice to overcome, defended by the enemies whole force, which the attack would draw to this quarter. On the other hand the country from the river St. Charles to the northward, for more than five miles, is extremely rough, broken and difficult, full of rivulets, gullies, and ravines, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to the river of Montmorenci, which flows by the foot of a ſteep and woody hill. On the ſide of the river St. Laurence is a bank of ſand of great extent, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the approach of any conſiderable veſſel.</p>
                        <p>In this advantageous ſituation was the French army poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon what was deemed the only acceſſible ſide of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec, all along from the river St. Charles to that of Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morenci, entrenched at every attackable ſpot, with the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ſandbank abovementioned in their front, and thick impenetrable woods upon their rear. It is impoſſible to imagine a ſtronger poſt; a poſt at once more defenſible in itſelf, or better calculated for ſuccouring a city, on which ſide ſoever it ſhould be attacked. Thus poſted, they great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceeded in number the beſiegers, being about 10,000 men, under an able, and thitherto fortunate commander, M. de Montcalm, who, though he was ſuperior in number to the Engliſh, reſolved to riſque nothing, and wiſely relied on the natural ſtrength of the country.</p>
                        <p>When Wolfe ſaw the ſituation of the town, the nature of the country, the number of the troops, and their poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though of a ſanguine temper and highly adventurous, he began to deſpair; but, however another commander might have thought inaction in ſuch circumſtances juſtified to himſelf, or even to the world, by ſuch ſtrong appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Wolfe reſolved to leave nothing unattempted, but amidſt the choice of difficulties which lay before him, to pitch upon thoſe where the valour of his troops might be employed with the beſt proſpect of ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as he had ſecured the weſt point of the iſle of Orleans, and that of Levi, he erected batteries there of cannon and mortars, on the high ground, from the point of Levi, which looks towards the town; theſe fired conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually upon the place; Admiral Saunders was ſtationed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the north channel of the iſle of Orleans, oppoſite to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1261701201:233"/>
Montmorenci; Admiral Holmes was ſtationed above the town, at once to diſtract the enemies attention, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any attempts from the enemy againſt the batteries that played upon the town.</p>
                        <p>After this wiſe diſpoſition was made of the fleet, Gen. Wolfe cauſed the troops to be tranſported over the north channel of the river St. Laurence, to the north-eaſt of Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morenci, with a view of paſſing that river, and bringing the enemy to an engagement. Some heights which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the enemies intrenchments, and a ford above, and another below the falls, encouraged him to this attempt; but upon reconnoitring the ground, the oppoſite ſhore was found ſo ſteep and woody, that he could not hope to put his deſign in execution, which was by moving towards the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies flank, to draw them to an engagement. To bring the French to an action was his ſingle object. He had found that any attempts to aſſault the city would prove to no purpoſe, whilſt the fleet could only batter the lower town, and muſt ſuffer greatly by the cannon and bombs of the upper, whilſt they were employed in this ineffectual ſervice; for after the reduction of the lower town, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to the upper were extremely ſteep, and moreover ſo well entrenched, that this advantage would prove little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the reduction of the place.</p>
                        <p>The only point left, therefore, was by every means to entice or force the enemy to an engagement; and to this end no means were omitted, by ſending detachments up the river, and by every appearance of a deſign to attack the town on that ſide. But the Marquis de Montcalm, in chuſing his poſt, was well appriſed of its importance. He knew ſufficiently the nature of the country up the river, and he truſted to it; and therefore kept himſelf cloſely in his poſt, diſpoſing his parties of ſavages, in which he was very ſtrong, in ſuch a manner, as to make any attempt upon him by ſurpriſe abſolutely impoſſible. In the mean time, from the town, fireſhips and boats were let down the ſtream to deſtroy the ſhipping, which, as they almoſt wholly filled the channel, were greatly endangered. But by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſkill and vigilance of Admiral Saunders, every veſſel of this kind ſent againſt them was towed aſhore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing the leaſt miſchief.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="197" facs="tcp:1261701201:234"/>The general finding that all his efforts to decoy the enemy to an engagement had proved unſucceſsful, and, ſenſible that they deſired nothing more than to act defenſively, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the ſeaſon itſelf ſhould fight for them and oblige the Engliſh to retire, he came at laſt, in ſpite of all difficulties, to the reſolution of attacking them in their entrenchments on the ſide of Montmorenci. The place where the attack was to be made, was choſen with great judgment, as the only place thereabouts in which the artillery could be brought into uſe; as there, and there only, the greateſt part, or even the whole of the troops, might act at once, and that there the retreat in caſe of a repulſe was ſecure, at leaſt for a certain time of the tide. Having determined upon the place where the attack was to be, which was at the mouth of the river Montmorenci, the beſt diſpoſitions for it were made, both on the part of the Admiral and of the General.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 30."/> 

 But notwithſtanding that the whole was conducted with equal vigour and prudence, it was totally defeated by one of thoſe accidents which ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently interpoſe to the diſgrace of human wiſdom, and which demonſtrates that ſhe is far from being the ſole arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of war.</p>
                        <p>The Engliſh grenadiers, who led the attack, had orders, immediately after their landing, to form themſelves on the beach; but inſtead of forming themſelves as they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, from the hurry and noiſe of their landing, or from an ill-governed ardor, they ruſhed impetuouſly towards the enemies entrenchments in the utmoſt diſorder and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without waiting for the corps which were to ſuſtain them, and join in the attack. In this diſorder, they were met by a violent and ſteady fire from the entrenchments, by which they were thrown into more confuſion, and obliged them to ſhelter themſelves behind a redoubt, which the French had abandoned on their appro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ch.</p>
                        <p>The General perceiving that it was impoſſible for theſe grenadiers to form under ſo ſevere a fire, that the night drew on, a violent tempeſt was gathering, and the tide began to make, ſaw clearly that he had nothing further left, than to order a retreat, with as little diſadvantage as poſſible. He therefore called off thoſe troops, and having formed behind Brig. Monckton's corps, which was on the beach in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1261701201:235"/>
order, the whole repaſſed the river without moleſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the General expoſing his perſon with that intrepidity, which diſtinguiſhed him both during the attack, and the retreat.</p>
                        <p>The loſs in this check was not inconſiderable; and the event on the whole was ſuch, as to diſcourage any further attempts upon that ſide. They returned to the old meaſures. The General again ſent ſome bodies above the town, and ſome men of war ſailed up the ſtream for more than twelve leagues. They received intelligence that the enemy had amaſſed ſome magazines of proviſions in the interior coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and they propoſed by getting between them and the town, to draw the French army from their entrenchments, to the long-deſired engagement; but if they failed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs this, they might at leaſt deſtroy the ſhips of war which the enemy had in the river, and help to open a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between them and Gen. Amherſt, on whom their laſt expectations were fixed, and who, they flattered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, was on his march to their aſſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>But though they ſucceeded in deſtroying ſome of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies magazines, there was nothing of great moment in this. They could not come near the men of war. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they received intelligence from ſome priſoners, of the ſucceſs of Sir William Johnſon againſt Niagara; they learned likewiſe, that the French had ſoothed the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the way of Gen. Amherſt, by abandoning Crown Point and Ticonderoga. But this intelligence, otherwiſe ſo pleaſing, brought them no proſpect of the approach of any aſſiſtance from that quarter. The ſeaſon waſted apace. The General fell violently ill, conſumed by care, watching, and a fatigue, too great to be ſupported by a delicate conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and a body unequal to that vigorous and enterpriſing ſoul that it lodged. It was not enough for him to eſcape from ſo great an expedition uncondemned and unapplauded; to be pitied, was he thought but a milder cenſure; and he knew that no military conduct can ſhine, unleſs it be gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſucceſs. His own high notions, the public hope, the good ſucceſs of other commanders, all turned inward upon him, oppreſſed his ſpirits, and converted diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into diſeaſe.

                                 <p>It was abſolutely neceſſary to poſſeſs theſe two points, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify them; becauſe from either the one or the other, the enemy might make it impoſſible for any ſhip to be in the baſon of <hi>Quebec,</hi> or even within two miles of it.</p>
                                 <p>Batteries of cannon and mortars were erected with great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch on the point of <hi>Levi,</hi> to bombard the town and magazines, and to injure the works and batteries: The enemy perceiving theſe works in ſome forwardneſs, paſſed the river with 1600 men to attack and deſtroy them. Unluckily they fell into confuſion, fired upon one another, and went back again; by which we loſt an opportunity of defeating this large detachment. The effect of this artillery has been ſo great (though acroſs the river) that the upper town is conſiderably damaged, and the lower town entirely deſtroyed.</p>
                                 <p>The works for the ſecurity of our hoſpitals and ſtores on the iſle of <hi>Orleans</hi> being finiſhed, on the 9th of <hi>July</hi> at night, we paſſed the North channel, and incamped near the enemy's left, the river <hi>Montmorenci</hi> between us The next morning Captain <hi>Dank</hi>'s Company of Rangers, poſted in a wood to cover ſome workmen, were attacked and defeated by a body of <hi>Indians,</hi> and had ſo many killed and wounded, as to be almoſt diſabled for the reſt of the campaign: The enemy alſo ſuffered in this affair, and were in their turn driven off by the neareſt troops.</p>
                                 <p>The ground, to the eaſtward of the falls, ſeemed to be (as it really is) higher than that on the enemy's ſide, and to command it in a manner which might be made uſeful to us. There is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a ford below the falls, which may be paſſed for ſome hours in the latter part of the ebb and beginning of the flood tide; and I had hopes, that poſſibly means might be found of paſſing the river above, ſo as to fight the Marquis <hi>de Montcalm,</hi> upon terms of leſs diſadvantage than directly attacking his intrenchments. In reconnoitring the river <hi>Montmorenci,</hi> we found it fordable at a place about three miles up; but the oppoſite bank was intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo ſteep and woody, that it was to no purpoſe to attempt a paſſage there. The Eſcort was twice attacked by the <hi>Indians,</hi> who were as often repulſed; but in theſe rencounters we had 40 (officers and men) killed and wounded.</p>
                                 <pb n="201" facs="tcp:1261701201:238"/>
                                 <p>The 18th of <hi>July,</hi> two men of war, two armed ſloops, and two tranſports with ſome troops on board, paſſed by the town without any loſs, and got into the upper river. This enabled me to reconnoitre the country above, where I found the ſame attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the enemy's ſide, and great difficulties on ours, ariſing from the nature of the ground, and the obſtacles to our communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the fleet. But what I feared moſt, was, that if we ſhould land between the town and the river, Capt. <hi>Rouge,</hi> the body firſt landed could not be reinforced before they were attacked by the enemy's whole army.</p>
                                 <p>Notwithſtanding theſe difficulties, I thought once of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it at St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s, about three miles above the town: but perceiving that the enemy were jealous of the deſign, were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt it, and had actually brought artillery and a mortar (which, being ſo near to <hi>Quebec,</hi> they could increaſe as they pleaſed) to play upon the ſhipping; and, as it muſt have been many hours before we could attack them, (even ſuppoſing a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable night for the boats to paſs by the town unhurt) it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo hazardous, that I thought it beſt to deſiſt.</p>
                                 <p>However, to divide the enemy's force, and to draw their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention as high up the river as poſſible, and to procure ſome intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, I ſent a detachment under the command of Col. <hi>Carleton,</hi> to land at the Point <hi>de Trempe,</hi> to attack whatever he might find there, bring off ſome priſoners, and all the uſeful papers he could get. I had been informed that a number of the inhabitants of <hi>Quebec,</hi> had retired to that place, and that probably we ſhould find a magazine of proviſions there.</p>
                                 <p>The Colonel was fired upon by a body of <hi>Indians</hi> the moment he landed, but they were ſoon diſperſed and driven into the woods: he ſearched for magazines, but to no purpoſe, brought off ſome priſoners, and returned with little loſs.</p>
                                 <p>After this buſineſs, I came back to <hi>Montmorenci,</hi> where I found that B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>ig. <hi>Townſhend</hi> had, by a ſuperior fire, prevented the <hi>French</hi> from erecting a battery on the bank of the river, from whence they intended to cannonade our camp. I now reſolved to take the firſt opportunity which preſented itſelf of attacking the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, though poſted to great advantage, and every where prepared to receive us.</p>
                                 <p>As the men of war cannot (for want of a ſufficient depth of water) come near enough to the enemy's intrenchments to annoy 
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1261701201:239"/>
them in the leaſt, the Admiral had prepared two tranſports (draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but little water) which upon occaſions could be run a ground, to favour a deſcent. With the help of theſe veſſels, which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood would be carried by the tide cloſe in ſhore, I propoſed to make myſelf maſter of a detached redoubt near to the water's edge, and whoſe ſituation appeared to be out of muſquet ſhot of the intrenchment upon the hill: If the enemy ſupported this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatched piece, it would neceſſarily bring on an engagement, what we moſt wiſhed for; and if not, I ſhould have it in my power to examine their ſituation, ſo as to be able to determine where we could beſt attack them.</p>
                                 <p>Preparations were accordingly made for an engagement. The 31ſt of <hi>July</hi> in the forenoon, the boats of the fleet were filled with grenadiers, and a part of Brig. <hi>Monckton</hi>'s brigade from the point of <hi>Levi:</hi> The two brigades under the Brigadiers <hi>Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhend</hi> and <hi>Murray</hi> were ordered to be in readineſs to paſs the ford, when it ſhould be thought neceſſary. To facilitate the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of this corps, the admiral had placed the <hi>Centurion</hi> in the channel, ſo that ſhe might check the fire of the lower battery which commanded the ford: This ſhip was of great uſe, as her fire was very judiciouſly directed. A great quantity of artillery was placed upon the eminence, ſo as to batter and enfilade the left of their intrenchments.</p>
                                 <p>From the veſſel which run a-ground, neareſt in. I obſerved that the redoubt was too much commanded to be kept without very great loſs; and the more, as the two armed ſhips could not be brought near enough to cover both with their artillery and muſquetry, which I at firſt conceived they might. But as the enemy ſeemed in ſome confuſion, and we were prepared for an action, I thought it a proper time to make an attempt upon their intrenchments. Orders were ſent to the Brigadiers Generals to be ready with the corps under their command. Brig. <hi>Monckton</hi> to land, and the Brigadiers <hi>Townſhend</hi> and <hi>Murray</hi> to paſs the ford.</p>
                                 <p>At a proper time of the tide, the ſignal was made, but in row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the ſhore, many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                                       <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                                    </gap> the boats grounded upon a ledge that runs of a conſiderable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                    </gap>ance. This accident put us into ſome diſorder, loſt a great deal off time, and obliged me to ſend an officer to ſtop Brig. <hi>Towſhend</hi>'s march, whom I then obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in motion. While the ſeamen were getting the boats off, 
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1261701201:240"/>
the enemy fired a number of ſhells and ſhot, but did no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable damage. As ſoon as this diſorder could be ſet a little to rights, and the boats were ranged in a proper manner, ſome of the officers of the navy went in with me, to find a better place to land: we took one flat-bottomed boat with us to make the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, and as ſoon as we had found a fit part of the ſhore, the troops were ordered to diſembark, thinking it not yet too late for the attempt.</p>
                                 <p>The 13 companies of grenadiers, and 200 of the ſcond <hi>Royal American</hi> battalion, got firſt on ſhore. The grenadiers were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to form themſelves into four diſtinct bodies, and to begin the attack, ſupported by Brig. <hi>Monckton</hi>'s corps, as ſoon as the troops had paſſed the ford, and were at hand to aſſiſt. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the noiſe and hurry at landing, or from ſome other cauſe, the grenadiers, inſtead of forming themſelves as they were directed, ran on impetuouſly towards the enemy's intrenchments in the utmoſt diſorder and confuſion, without waiting for the corps which were to ſuſtain them, and join in the attack. Brig. <hi>Monckton</hi> was not landed, and Brig. <hi>Townſhend</hi> was ſtill at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance, though upon his march to join us, in very great order. The grenadiers were checked by the enemy's firſt fire, and obliged to ſhelter themſelves in or about the redoubt, which the <hi>French</hi> abandoned upon their approach. In this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they continued for ſome time, unable to form under ſo hot a fire, and having many gallant officers wounded, who (careleſs of their perſons) had been ſolely intent upon their duty. I ſaw the abſolute neceſſity of calling them off, that they might form themſelves behind Brig. <hi>Monckton</hi>'s corps, which was now landed, and drawn up on the beach, in extreme good order.</p>
                                 <p>By this new accident, and this ſecond delay, it was near night, a ſudden ſtorm came on, and the tide began to make; ſo that I thought it moſt adviſeable, not to perſevere in ſo difficult an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, leſt (in caſe of a repulſe) the retreat of Brig. <hi>Townſhend</hi>'s corps might be hazardous and uncertain.</p>
                                 <p>Our artillery had a great effect upon the enemy's left, where Brigadiers <hi>Townſhend</hi> and <hi>Murray</hi> were to have attacked; and, it is probable that if thoſe accidents I have ſpoken of, had not happened, we ſhould have penetrated there, whilſt our left and centre (more remote from our artillery) muſt have bore all the violence of their muſquetry.</p>
                                 <pb n="204" facs="tcp:1261701201:241"/>
                                 <p>The French did not attempt to interrupt our march. Some of their ſavages came down to murder ſuch wounded as could not be brought off, and to ſcalp the dead, as their cuſtom is.</p>
                                 <p>The place where the attack was intended, has theſe advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges over all others hereabout. Our artillery could be brought into uſe. The greateſt part, or even the whole of the troops, might act at once. And the retreat (in caſe of repulſe) was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, at leaſt for a certain time of the tide. Neither one or other of theſe advantages can any where elſe be found. The enemy were indeed poſted upon a commanding eminence. The beach upon which the troops were drawn up, was of deep mud, with holes, and cut by ſeveral gullies. The hill to be aſcended very ſteep, and not every where practicable. The enemy numerous in their intrenchments, and their fire hot. If the attack had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, our loſs muſt certainly have been great, and their's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, from the ſhelter which the neighbouring woods af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them. The river St. <hi>Charles</hi> ſtill remained to be paſſed, before the town was inverted. All theſe circumſtances I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; but the deſire to act in conformity to the King's intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, induced me to make this trial, perſuaded that a victorious army finds no difficulties.</p>
                                 <p>The enemy have been fortifying ever ſince with care, ſo as to make a ſecond attempt ſtill more dangerous.</p>
                                 <p>Immediately after this check, I ſent Brig. <hi>Murray</hi> above the town with 1200 men, directing him to aſſiſt Rear Admiral <hi>Holmes</hi> in the deſtruction of the <hi>French</hi> ſhips (if they could be got at) in order to open a communication with Gen. <hi>Amherſt.</hi> The Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier was to ſeek every favourable opportunity of fighting ſome of the enemy's detachments, provided he could do it upon tolerable terms, and to uſe all the means in his power to provoke them to attack him. He made two different attempts to and upon the North ſhore without ſucceſs; but in a third was more fortunate. He landed unexpectedly at <hi>De Chambaud,</hi> and burnt a magazine there, in which were ſome proviſions, ſome ammunition, and all the ſpare ſtores, clothing, arms, and baggage, of their army.</p>
                                 <p>Finding that their ſhips were not to be got at, and little proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of bringing the enemy to a battle, he reported his ſituation to me, and I ordered him to join the army.</p>
                                 <p>The priſoners he took informed him of the ſurrender of the fort of <hi>Niagara;</hi> and we diſcovered, by intercepted letters, that 
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1261701201:242"/>
the enemy had abandoned <hi>Carillon</hi> and <hi>Crown Point,</hi> were reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the iſle <hi>Aux Noix;</hi> and that Gen. <hi>Amherſt</hi> was making pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to paſs the Lake <hi>Champlain,</hi> to fall upon M. <hi>de Bourle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maque</hi>'s corps, which conſiſts of three battalions of foot, and as many <hi>Canadians</hi> as make the whole amount to 3000 men.</p>
                                 <p>The Admiral's diſpatches and mine would have gone eight or ten days ſooner, if I had not been prevented from writing by a fever. I found myſelf ſo ill, and am ſtill ſo weak, that I begged the general officers to conſult together for the public utility. They are all of opinion, that (as more ſhips and proviſions have now got above the town) they ſhould try, by conveying up a corps of 4 or 5000 men (which is nearly the whole ſtrength of the army, after the points of <hi>Levi</hi> and <hi>Orleans</hi> are left in a proper ſtate of defence) to draw the enemy from their preſent ſituation, and bring them to an action. I have acquieſced in their propoſal, and we are preparing to put it in execution.</p>
                                 <p>The Admiral and I have examined the town, with a view to a general aſſault; but, after conſulting with the chief engineer, who is well acquainted with the interior parts of it, and, after viewing it with the utmoſt attention, we found, that though the batteries of the Lower Town might be eaſily ſilenced by the men of war, yet the buſineſs of an aſſault would be little advanced by that, ſince the few paſſages that lead from the Lower to the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Town, are carefully intrenched; and the upper batteries can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be affected by the ſhips, which muſt receive conſiderable da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage from them and from the mortars. The Admiral would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily join in this, or in any other meaſure, for the public ſervice; but I could not propoſe to him an undertaking of ſo dangerous a nature, and promiſing ſo little ſucceſs.</p>
                                 <p>To the uncommon ſtrength of the country, the enemy have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (for the defence of the river) a great number of floating bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and boats. By the vigilance of theſe and the <hi>Indians</hi> round our different poſts, it has been impoſſible to execute any thing by ſurprize. We have had almoſt daily ſkirmiſhes with theſe Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in which they are generally defeated, but not without loſs on our ſide.</p>
                                 <p>By the liſt of diſabled officers (many of whom are of rank) you may perceive, Sir, that the army is much weakened. By the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the river, the moſt formidable part of this armament is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived 
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1261701201:243"/>
of the power of acting, yet we have almoſt the whole force of <hi>Canada</hi> to oppoſe. In this ſituation, there is ſuch a choice of difficulties, that I own myſelf at a loſs how to determine. The affairs of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> I know, require the moſt vigourous mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; but then the courage of a handful of brave men ſhould be exerted only where there is ſome hope of a favourable event. However, you may be aſſured, Sir, that the ſmall part of the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign which remains, ſhall be employed (as far as I am able) for the honour of his Majeſty and the intereſt of the nation, in which I am ſure of being well ſeconded by the Admiral and by the Generals. Happy if our efforts here can contribute to the ſucceſs of his Majeſty's arms in any other parts of <hi>America.</hi>

                                 <p>IN my letter of the 6th of <hi>June,</hi> I acquainted you I was then off <hi>Scutari,</hi> ſtanding for the river St. <hi>Laurence.</hi> On the 26th, I had got up, with the firſt diviſion of the fleet and tranſports, as far as the middle of the Iſle of <hi>Orleans,</hi> where I immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to land the troops, which I did the next morning. The ſame day the ſecond and third diviſions came up, and the troops from them were landed likewiſe.</p>
                                 <p>I got thus far without any loſs or accident whatever; but, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly after landing the troops, a very hard gale of wind came on, by which many anchors and ſmall boats were loſt, and much da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage received among the tranſports, by their driving on board each other. The ſhips that loſt moſt anchors I ſupplied from the men of war as far as I was able, and in all other reſpects, gave them the beſt aſſiſtance in my power.</p>
                                 <pb n="207" facs="tcp:1261701201:244"/>
                                 <p>On the 28th, at midnight, the enemy ſent down from <hi>Quebec</hi> ſeven fireſhips; and though our ſhips and tranſports were ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and neceſſarily ſpread ſo great a part of the channel, we towed them all clear and a-ground, without receiving the leaſt damage from them. The next night Gen. <hi>Monckton</hi> croſſed the river, and landed with his Brigade on the South ſhore, and took poſt at Point <hi>Levi;</hi> and Gen. <hi>Wolfe</hi> took his on the Weſtmoſt Point of the Iſle of <hi>Orleans.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>On the 1ſt of <hi>July,</hi> I moved up between the Points of <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Levi;</hi> and, it being reſolved to land on the North ſhore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the falls of <hi>Montmorenci,</hi> I placed on the 8th inſt. his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's ſloop the <hi>Porcupine,</hi> and the <hi>Boſcawen</hi> armed veſſel, in the channel between <hi>Orleans</hi> and the North ſhore, to cover that land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which took place at night.</p>
                                 <p>On the 17th, I ordered Capt. <hi>Rous</hi> of the <hi>Sutherland,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, with the firſt fair wind and night tide, above the town of <hi>Quebec,</hi> and to take with him his majeſty's ſhips <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Squir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,</hi> with two armed ſloops, and two catts armed and loaded with proviſions.</p>
                                 <p>On the 18th, at night, they all got up, except the <hi>Diana,</hi> and gave Gen. <hi>Wolfe</hi> an opportunity of reconnoitring above the town, thoſe ſhips having carried ſome troops with them for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The <hi>Diana</hi> ran aſhore upon the rocks off Point <hi>Levi,</hi> and received ſo much damage, that I have ſent her to <hi>Boſton</hi> with 27 ſail of <hi>American</hi> tranſports, (thoſe which received moſt damage in the gale of the 27th of <hi>June</hi>) where they are to be diſcharged; and the <hi>Diana,</hi> having repaired her damages, is to proceed to <hi>England,</hi> taking with her the maſt ſhips, and what trade may be ready to accompany her.</p>
                                 <p>On the 28th, at mignight, the enemy ſent down a raft of fire-ſtages, of near a hundred Radeaux, which ſucceeded no better than the fire-ſhips.</p>
                                 <p>On the 31ſt, Gen. <hi>Wolfe</hi> determined to land a number of troops above the falls of <hi>Montmorenci,</hi> in order to attack the enemy's lines; to cover which, I placed the <hi>Centurion</hi> in the channel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Iſle of <hi>Orleans</hi> and the falls, and ran on ſhore, at high water, two catts which I had armed for that purpoſe, againſt two ſmall batteries and two redoubts, where our troops were to land. About ſix in the evening they landed, but the Generel not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it proper to perſevere in the attack; ſoon after, part of them 
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1261701201:245"/>
re-embarked, and the reſt croſſed the Falls with Gen. <hi>Wolfe;</hi> upon which, to prevent the two catts from falling into the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's hands (they being then dry on ſhore) I gave orders to take the men out and ſet them on fire, which was accordingly done.</p>
                                 <p>On the 5th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the night, I ſent twenty flat-bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed boats up the river, to the <hi>Sutherland,</hi> to embark 1260 of the troops, with Brig. Gen. <hi>Murray,</hi> from a poſt he had taken on the ſouth ſhore. I ſent Admiral <hi>Holmes</hi> up to the <hi>Sutherland,</hi> to act in concert with him, and give him all the aſſiſtance the ſhips and boats could afford. At the ſame time I directed Admiral <hi>Holmes</hi> to uſe his beſt endeavours to get at, and deſtroy the enemy's ſhips above the town; and for that purpoſe I ordered the <hi>Loweſtoffe,</hi> and <hi>Hunter</hi> ſloop, with two armed ſloops and two catts, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, to paſs <hi>Quebec</hi> and join the <hi>Sutherland;</hi> but the wind holding weſterly, it was the 27th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> before they got up, which was the fourth attempt they had made to gain their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
                                 <p>On the 25th, at night, Admiral <hi>Holmes</hi> and Gen. <hi>Murray,</hi> with part of the troops, returned; they had met with, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed a magazine of the enemy's cloathing, ſome gunpowder, and other things; and Admiral <hi>Holmes</hi> had been ten or twelve leagues above the town, but found it impracticable at that time to get farther up.</p>
                                 <p>Gen. <hi>Wolfe</hi> having reſolved to quit the camp at <hi>Montmorenci,</hi> and go above the town, in hopes of getting between the enemy and their proviſions, (ſuppoſed to be in the ſhips there) and by that means force them to an action, I ſent up, on the 29th at night, the <hi>Seahorſe</hi> and two armed ſloops, with two catts laden with proviſions, to join the reſt above <hi>Quebec;</hi> and having taken off all the artillery, from the camp at <hi>Montmorenci,</hi> on the 3d inſt. in the afternoon the troops embarked from thence, and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Point <hi>Levi.</hi> The 4th, at night, I ſent all the flat-bottomed boats up, and this night a part of the troops will march up the ſouth ſhore, above the town, to be embarked in the ſhips and veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels there, and to-morrow night the reſt will follow. Admiral <hi>Holmes</hi> is alſo gone up again to aſſiſt in their future operations, and to try, if, with the aſſiſtance of the troops, it is practicable to get at the enemy's ſhips.</p>
                                 <p>As Gen. <hi>Wolfe</hi> writes by this opportunity, he will give you an account of his part of the operations, and his thoughts what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1261701201:246"/>
may be done for his Majeſty's ſervice. The enemy appear numerous, and ſeem to be ſtrongly poſted; but let the event be what it will, we ſhall remain here as long as the ſeaſon will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, in order to prevent their detaching troops from hence againſt Gen. <hi>Amherſt;</hi> and I ſhall leave cruizers at the mouth of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to cut off any ſupplies that may be ſent them, with ſtrict or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to keep that ſtation as long as poſſible. The town of <hi>Quebec</hi> is not habitable, being almoſt entirely burnt and deſtroyed.</p>
                                 <p>I encloſe you the preſent diſpoſition of the ſhips under my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: twenty of the victuallers that ſailed from <hi>England</hi> with the <hi>Echo,</hi> are arrived here, one unloaded at <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived damage in her paſſage out, and another I have heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of. No ſhips of the enemy have come this way, that I have had any intelligence of, ſince my arrival in the river except one, laden with flour and brandy, which was taken by Capt. <hi>Drake</hi> of the <hi>Lizard.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Before Admiral <hi>Durell</hi> got into the river, three frigates, and ſeventeen ſail, with proviſions, ſtores, and a few recruits, got up, and are thoſe we are ſo anxious, if poſſible, to deſtroy.</p>
                                 <p>Yeſterday I received a letter from Gen <hi>Amherſt</hi> (to whom I have had no opportunity of writing ſince I have been in the river) dated Camp off <hi>Crown Point, Auguſt</hi> 17th, wherein, he only deſires I would ſend tranſports and a convoy to <hi>New York,</hi> to carry to <hi>England</hi> ſix hundred and ſeventy priſoners taken at the ſurrender of <hi>Niagara.</hi>

                                 <p>I ſhall very ſoon ſend home the great ſhips, and have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be,</p>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1261701201:238"/>
attempts at Montmorenci were to little purpoſe, and that their principal operations ſhould be above the town, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if poſſible, to draw the enemy to an action. But the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1261701201:239"/>
deſign of Wolfe was deeper, and more particularly direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than it had been before. The camp at Montmorenci was broke up, and the troops were conveyed to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1261701201:240"/>
of the river, and encamped at Point Levi. The ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron under Admiral Holmes made movements up the river for ſeveral days ſucceſſively, in order to draw the enemies
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1261701201:241"/>
attention as far from the town as poſſible. This ſucceeded in ſome meaſure; for, though it could not perſuade the Marquis de Montcalm to quit his poſt, it induced him to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1261701201:242"/>
detach M. de Bougainville with 1500 men to watch their motions, and to proceed along the weſtern ſhore of the river, whilſt the Engliſh army directed its march the ſame way on the eaſtern bank.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="206" facs="tcp:1261701201:243"/>When Gen. Wolfe ſaw that matters were ripe for action, he ordered the ſhips under Admiral Saunders to make a feint, as if they propoſed to attack the French in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1261701201:244"/>
on the Beauport ſhore below the town, and by their motions to give this feint all the appearance of a reality which it poſſibly could have. This diſpoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1261701201:245"/>
made below the town, the General embarked his forces about one in the morning, and with Admiral Holmes's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion went three leagues further up the river than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1261701201:246"/>
place of his landing, in order to amuſe the enemy, and conceal his real deſign. Then he put them into boats, and fell down ſilently with the tide, unobſerved by the French centinels poſted along the ſhore. The rapidity of the current carried theſe boats a little below the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place of attack. The ſhips followed them, and arrived juſt at the time which had been concerted to cover their
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:1261701201:247"/>
landing. Conſidering the darkneſs of the night, and the rapidity of the current, this was a very critical operation, and it required excellent heads both on the part of the marine, and the land ſervice, to preſerve a communication, and to prevent a diſcovery and confuſion.</p>
                        <p>As the troops could not land at the ſpot propoſed, when they were put on ſhore an hill appeared before them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely high and ſteep in its aſcent; a little path winded up this aſcent, ſo narrow that two could not go abreaſt. Even this path was intrenched, and a captain's guard de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it. Theſe difficulties did not abate the hopes of the General, or the ardor of the troops. The light infantry under Colonel Howe laying hold of ſtumps and boughs of trees, pulled themſelves up, diſlodged the guards, and cleared the path; and then all the troops ſurmounting eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficulty, gained the top of the hill, and as faſt as they aſcended formed themſelves, ſo that they were all in order of battle at day break.</p>
                        <p>Montcalm, when he heard that the Engliſh had aſcended the hill,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sept. 13."/> 

 and were formed on the high ground at the back of the town, ſcarcely credited the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and ſtill believed it to be a feint to induce him to abandon that ſtrong poſt, which had been the object of all the real attempts that had been made ſince the beginning of the campaign. But he was ſoon, and fatally for him, undeceived. He ſaw clearly, that the Engliſh fleet and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were in ſuch a ſituation, that the upper and lower town might be attacked in concert, and that nothing but a battle could poſſibly ſave it. Accordingly he determined to give them battle, and quitting Beauport, paſſed the river St. Charles, and formed his troops oppoſite to ours.</p>
                        <p>He filled the buſhes that were in his front with detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Indians, and his beſt markſmen, to the number of about 1500; his regular forces formed his left; his right was compoſed of the troops of the colony, ſupported by two battali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ns of regulars. The reſt of the Indians and Canadians extended on that ſide, and attempted to out-flank the left of the Engliſh, which was formed to prevent that deſign, in a manner which the military men call <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;</hi> that is, in a body which preſents two faces to the enemy. Here Brigadier General Townſhend commanded ſix regiments, and the Louiſbourg grenadiers were diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a line to the right of this body, extending to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1261701201:248"/>
A regiment was drawn up behind the right for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. It was formed in eight ſubdiviſions, with large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals. The light infantry under Colonel Howe, protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the rear and the left. The diſpoſitions on both ſides were judicious, and the engagement on both ſides began with ſpirit.</p>
                        <p>The Engliſh troops were exhorted to reſerve their fire; and they bore that of the enemy's light troops in front, which was galling, though irregular, with the utmoſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and good order, waiting for the main body of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, which advanced faſt upon them. At forty yards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, our troops gave their fire, which took place in its full extent, and made a terrible havock among the French. It was ſupported with as much vivacity as it was begun, and the enemy every where yielded to it; but juſt in the moment, when the fortune of the field began to declare itſelf, General Wolfe, in whoſe life every thing ſeemed included, fell: General Monckton, the next to him in command, fell immediately after, and both were conveyed out of the line; the command now devolved on General Townſhend. It was at a very critical time. For, though the enemy began to fall back, and were much broken, the loſs of the two generals was a very diſcouraging circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and it required great temper and great exertions to ſupport the advantages that had been gained, and to puſh them to their proper extent. General Townſhend ſhewed himſelf equal to ſo arduous a duty; the troops preſerved their ſpirit, and each corps ſeemed to exert itſelf with a view to its peculiar character. The grenadiers with their bayonets, the Highlanders with their broad ſwords, and the reſt of the forces, with a ſteady and continued fire, drove the enemy in great diſorder from every poſt, and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their defeat. During the whole action, Colonel Howe with his light infantry covered the left wing in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as entirely to fruſtrate the attempts of the enemies In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and Canadians upon that flank.</p>
                        <p>The field now ſeemed to be compleatly decided, when a new enemy appeared, which threatened to bring on a freſh engagement, and to put all again to the hazard. M. de Bougainville, whom the feigned movements of the Engliſh troops had drawn up the river, turned back on diſcovering their real deſign, and now appeared on the rear of the army, with a body of 2000 men. But fortunately the main body
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:1261701201:249"/>
of the French was by this time ſo broken and diſperſed, that the General was able to eſtabliſh his rear, and to turn ſuch an oppoſition on that ſide that the enemy retired after a very feeble attempt.</p>
                        <p>In this deciſive action our troops loſt about 500 men; on the ſide of the enemy at leaſt 1500 were killed. But however glorious this victory was, and however important in its conſequences, it muſt be admitted that it was very dearly bought. Soldiers may be raiſed; officers will be formed by experience; but the loſs of a genius in war, is a loſs which we know not how to repair. The death of Wolfe was indeed grievous to his country, but to himſelf the moſt happy that can be imagined; and the moſt to be envied by all thoſe who have a true reliſh for military glory. Unindebted to family, or connections, unſupported by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue or faction, he had accompliſhed the whole buſineſs of life at a time, when others are only beginning to appear; and at the age of thirty-five, without feeling the weakneſs of age or the viciſſitude of fortune, having ſatisfied his honeſt ambition, having compleated his character, having fulfilled the expectations of his country, he fell at the head of his conquering troops, and expired in the arms of victory.</p>
                        <p>The circumſtances that attended the death of ſuch a perſon, are too intereſting to be paſſed over in ſilence, and they were indeed ſuch as ſpoke the whole tenor of his life. He firſt received a wound in his head; but, that he might not diſcourage his troops, he wrapped it up in his hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and encouraged his men to advance: ſoon after he received another b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ll in his belly; this alſo he diſſembled, and exerted himſelf as before; when he received a third in his breaſt, under which he at laſt ſunk, and ſuffered himſelf, unwillingly, to be carried behind the ranks. As he lay ſtruggling with the anguiſh and weakneſs of three grievous wounds, he ſeemed only ſollicitous about the fortune of the battle. He begged one, who attended him, to ſupport him to view the field; but as he found that the approach of death had dimmed and confuſed his ſight, he deſired an officer, who was by him, to give him an account of what he ſaw. The officer anſwered, that the enemy ſeemed broken; he repeated his queſtion a few minutes after with much anxiety, when he was told that the enemy was totally routed, and that they fled in all parts. Then, ſaid he, "I am ſatisfied;" and immediately he expired.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="213" facs="tcp:1261701201:250"/>Without the ſame advantages, the enemy alſo had an heavy loſs in this battle, which, no doubt, contributed to their defeat. M. de Montcalm, commander in chief, was killed on the ſpot; an officer who had done the higheſt ſervices to his country throughout the whole American war, and perfectly ſupported his reputation in this laſt ſeene of it, having made the moſt perfect diſpoſitions that human prudence could ſuggeſt, both before the battle and in the engagement. It is ſomething remarkable that in both ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the firſt in command ſhould be killed, and the ſecond dangerouſly wounded. But General Monckton happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, the French officer died a little after the battle.</p>
                        <p>Five days after the action, the enemy ſeeing that the communication between the town and the army was cut off,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sept. 18."/> 

 and that the Engliſh fleet and troops were preparing with all vigour for a ſiege, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered the city of Quebec upon terms of honour to the garriſon, and advantage to the inhabitants, who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the free exerciſe of their religion, and the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their civil rights, until a general peace ſhould decide their future condition. The fortifications of the city were in tolerable order; the houſes almoſt totally demoliſhed. A garriſon of 5000 men under General Murray, were put into the place, with a plenty of proviſions and ammunition for the winter. The fleet ſailed to England ſoon after, fearing leſt the ſetting in of the froſts ſhould lock them up in the river St. Laurence. <hi rend="sup">(a)</hi>

                                 <p>I Have the honour to acquaint you with the ſucceſs of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's arms, on the 13th inſt. in an action with the <hi>French,</hi> on the heights to the weſtward of this town.</p>
                                 <p>It being determined to carry the operations above the town the poſts at <hi>Point Levi,</hi> and <hi>l'Iſle d'Orleans,</hi> being ſecured, the General marched with the remainder of the force, from <hi>Point Levi,</hi> the 5th and 6th, and embarked them in tranſports, which had paſſed the town for that purpoſe. On the 7th, 8th, and 9th, a movement of the ſhips was made up, by Admiral <hi>Holmes,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to amuſe the enemy now poſted along the North ſhore; but the tranſports being extremely crowded, and the weather very bad, the General thought proper to cantoon half his troops on the South ſhore; where they were refreſhed, and reimbarked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 12th at one in the morning. The light infantry, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Col. <hi>Howe,</hi> the regiments of <hi>Bragg, Kennedy, Laſcelles,</hi> and <hi>Anſtruther,</hi> with a detachment of <hi>Highlanders,</hi> and the <hi>American</hi> grenadiers, the whole being under the command of Brigadiers <hi>Monckton</hi> and <hi>Murray,</hi> were put into flat-bottomed boats, and, after ſome movements of the ſhips, made by Admiral <hi>Holmes,</hi> to draw the attention of the enemy above, the boats fell down with the tide, and landed on the North ſhore, within a league of Cape <hi>Diamond,</hi> an hour before day-break: the rapidity of the tide of ebb carried them a little below the intended place of attack, which obliged the light infantry to ſcramble up a
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:1261701201:252"/>
woody precipice, in order to ſecure the landing the troops by diſlodging a captain's poſt, which defended the ſmall intrenched path the troops were to aſcend. After a little firing, the light infantry gained the top of the precipice, and diſperſed the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's poſt; by which means, the troops, with a very little loſs, from a few <hi>Canadians</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> in the wood, got up, and were immediately formed. The boats, as they emptied, were ſent back for the ſecond embarkation, which I immediately made. Brigadier <hi>Murray,</hi> who had been detached with <hi>Anſtruther</hi>'s battalion to attack the Four Gun Battery upon the left, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called by the General, who now ſaw the <hi>French</hi> army croſſing the river St. <hi>Charles.</hi> General <hi>Wolfe</hi> thereupon begun to form his line, having his right covered by the <hi>Louiſbourg</hi> grenadiers; on the right of theſe again he afterwards brought <hi>Otway</hi>'s; to the left of the grenadiers were <hi>Bragg</hi>'s, <hi>Kennedy</hi>'s, <hi>Laſcelles</hi>'s, <hi>Highlanders,</hi> and <hi>Anſtruther</hi>'s; the right of this body was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Brigadier <hi>Monckton,</hi> and the left by Brigadier <hi>Murray;</hi> his rear and left were protected by Col. <hi>Howe</hi>'s Light-infantry, who was returned from the Four Gun Battery before-mentioned, which was ſoon abandoned to him. General <hi>Montcalm</hi> having collected the whole of his force from the <hi>Beauport</hi> ſide, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, ſhewed his intention to flank our left, where I was immediately ordered with General <hi>Amherſt</hi>'s battalion, which I formed <hi>en potence.</hi> My numbers were ſoon after encreaſed by the arrival of the two battalions of <hi>Royal Americans;</hi> and <hi>Webb</hi>'s was drawn up by the General, as a reſerve, in eight ſubdiviſions with large intervals. The enemy lined the buſhes in their front with 1500 <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Canadians,</hi> and I dare ſay had placed moſt of their beſt markſmen there, who kept up a very galling, tho' irregular, fire upon our whole line, who bore it with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt patience, and good order, reſerving their fire for the main body now advancing. This fire of the enemy was however checked by our poſts in our front, which protected the forming our own line. The right of the enemy was compoſed of half of the troops of the colony, the battalion of <hi>La Sarre Languedoc,</hi> and the remainder of the <hi>Canadians</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> Their centre was a column, and formed by the battalions of <hi>Bearn</hi> and <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne.</hi> Their left was compoſed of the remainder of the troops of the colony, and the battalion of <hi>Royal Rouſillon.</hi> This was, as near as I can gueſs, their line of battle. They brought up
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1261701201:253"/>
two pieces of ſmall artillery againſt us, and we had been able to bring up but one gun; which being admirably well ſerved, galled their column exceedingly. My attention to the left will not permit me to be very exact with regard to every circumſtance which paſſed in the centre, much leſs to the right; but it is moſt certain, that the enemy formed in good order, and that their attack was very briſk and animated on that ſide. Our troops reſerved their fire, till within forty yards, which was ſo well continued, that the enemy every where gave way. It was then our General fell at the head of <hi>Bragg</hi>'s, and the <hi>Louiſbourg</hi> grenadiers, advancing with their bayonets: About the ſame time Brigadier-general <hi>Monckton</hi> received his wound at the head of <hi>Laſcelles</hi>'s. In the front of the oppoſite battalion fell alſo M. <hi>Montcalm;</hi> and his ſecond in command is ſince dead of his wounds on board our fleet. Part of the enemy made a ſecond faint attack. Part took to ſome thick copſe wood, and ſeemed to make a ſtand. It was at this moment, that each corps ſeemed in a manner to exert itſelf, with a view to its own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar character. The grenadiers, <hi>Bragg</hi>'s, and <hi>Laſcelles</hi>'s, preſſed on with their bayonets. Brigadier <hi>Murray,</hi> advancing with the troops under his command, briſkly compleated their rout on this ſide; when the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> ſupported by <hi>Arſtruther</hi>'s, took to their broad ſwords, and drove part into the town, and part to the works at their bridge on the river <hi>St. Charles.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>The action, on our left and rear, was not ſo ſevere. The houſes, into which the Light Infantry were thrown, were well defended, being ſupported by Col. <hi>Howe,</hi> who taking poſt with two companies behind a ſmall copſe, and frequently ſallying upon the flanks of the enemy during the attack, drove them often into heaps, againſt the front of which body I advanced platoons of <hi>Amherſt</hi>'s regiment, which totally prevented the right wing from executing their firſt intention. Before this, one of the <hi>Royal American</hi> battalions had been detached to preſerve our communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with our boats, and the other being ſent to occupy the ground which Brigadier <hi>Murray</hi>'s movement had left open, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with <hi>Amherſt</hi>'s to ſupport this diſpoſition, and to keep the enemy's right, and a body of their ſavages, which waited ſtill more towards our rear, oppoſite the poſts of our Light In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, waiting for an opportunity to fall upon our rear.</p>
                                 <p>This, Sir, was the ſituation of things, when I was told, in the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1261701201:254"/>
action, that I commanded: I immediately repaired to the centre, and finding the purſuit had put part of the troops in diſorder, I formed them as ſoon as poſſible. Scarce was this effected, when M. <hi>de Bougainville,</hi> with his corps from <hi>Cape Rouge</hi> of 2000 men, appeared in our rear. I advanced two pieces of artillery, and two battalions towards him; upon which he retired. You will not, I flatter myſelf, blame me for not quitting ſuch advantageous ground, and riſking the fate of ſo deciſive a day, by ſeeking a freſh enemy, poſted perhaps in the very kind of ground he could wiſh for, viz. woods and ſwamps.</p>
                                 <p>We took a great number of <hi>French</hi> officers upon the field of battle, and one piece of cannon. Their loſs is computed to be about 1500 men, which fell chiefly upon their regulars.</p>
                                 <p>I have been employed, from the day of action to that of the capitulation, in redoubting our camp beyond inſult, in making a road up the precipice for our cannon, in getting up the artillery, preparing the batteries, and cutting off their communication with the country. The 17th, at noon, before we had any battery erected, or could have any for two or three days, a flag of truce came out with propoſals of capitulation, which I ſent back again to the town, allowing them four hours to capitulate, or no farther treaty. The Admiral had, at this time, brought up his large ſhips as intending to attack the town. The <hi>French</hi> officer returned at night with terms of capitulation, which, with the Admiral, were conſidered, agreed to, and ſigned at eight in the morning, the 18th inſtant. The terms we granted, will I flatter myſelf, be approved of by his Majeſty, conſidering the enemy aſſembling in our rear, and what is far more formidable, the very wet and cold ſeaſon, which threatened our troops with ſickneſs, and the fleet with ſome accident; it had made our road ſo bad, we could not bring up a gun for ſome time; add to this, the advantage of entering the town, with the walls in a defenſible ſtate, and the being able to put a garriſon there ſtrong enough to prevent all ſurprize. Theſe, I hope, will be deemed ſufficient conſiderations for granting them the terms I have the honour to tranſmit to you. The inhabitants of the country came in to us faſt, bring<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 <p>I have the honour to incloſe herewith a liſt of the killed and wounded; a liſt of the priſoners as perfect as I have yet been able

to get it; and a liſt of the artillery and ſtores in the town as well as thoſe fallen into our hands at <hi>Beauport</hi> in conſequence of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. By deſerters we learn, that the enemy are re-aſſembling what troops they can, behind the <hi>Cape Rouge;</hi> that M. <hi>de Levy</hi> is come down from the <hi>Montreal</hi> ſide to command them; ſome ſay, he has brought two battalions with him; if ſo, this blow has already aſſiſted General <hi>Amherſt.</hi> By other deſerters, we learn, that M. <hi>de Bougainville,</hi> with 800 men, and proviſions, was on his march to fling himſelf into the town the 18th, the very morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it capitulated, on which day we had not compleated the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture of the place, as they had broke their bridge of boats, and had detachments in very ſtrong works on the other ſide the river <hi>St. Charles.</hi>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1261701201:257"/>
ſoldiers and ſeamen, were embarked on board ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> catts, who ſhall ſoon proceed for <hi>France,</hi> agreeable to the capitulation.</p>
                                 <p>I had the honour to write to you the 5th inſt by the <hi>Rodney</hi> cutter. The troops, mentioned in that letter, imbarked on board the ſhips and veſſels above the town, in the night of the 6th inſt. and at four in the morning of the 13th began to land on the north ſhore, about a mile and a half above the town. General <hi>Montcalm</hi> with his whole army, left their camp at <hi>Beauport,</hi> and marched to meet him. A little before ten both armies were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the enemy began the attack. Our troops received their fire, and reſerved their own, advancing till they were ſo near as to run in upon them, and puſh them with their bayonets; by which, in a very little time, the <hi>French</hi> gave way, and fled to the town in the utmoſt diſorder, and with great loſs; for our troops purſued them quite to the walls, and killed many of them upon the glacis, and in the ditch; and if the town had been further off the whole <hi>French</hi> army muſt have been deſtroyed. About 250 <hi>French</hi> priſoners were taken that day, among whom are ten captains, and ſix ſubaltern officers, all of whom will go in the great ſhips to <hi>England.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>I am ſorry to acquaint you, that General <hi>Wolfe</hi> was killed in the action; and General <hi>Monckton</hi> ſhot through the body; but he is now ſuppoſed to be out of danger. General <hi>Montcalm,</hi> and the three next <hi>French</hi> officers in command, were killed; but I muſt refer you to General <hi>Townſhend</hi> (who writes by this opportunity) for the particulars of this action, the ſtate of the garriſon, and the meaſures he is taking for keeping poſſeſſion of it. I am now beginning to ſend on ſhore the ſtores they will want, and proviſions for five thouſand men; of which I can furniſh them with a ſufficient quantity.</p>
                                 <p>The night of their landing, Admiral <hi>Holmes,</hi> with the ſhips and troops, was about three leagues above the intended landing place: General <hi>Wolfe,</hi> with about half his troops, ſet off in boats, and dropped down with the tide, and were by that means, leſs liable to be diſcovered by the <hi>French</hi> centinels, poſted all along the coaſt. The ſhips followed them about three quarters of an hour afterwards, and got to the landing place juſt in the time that had been concerted, to cover their landing; and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the darkneſs of the night, and the rapidity of the current, this was a very critical operation and very properly and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1261701201:258"/>
conducted. When General <hi>Wolfe,</hi> and the troops with him, had landed, the difficulty of gaining the top of the hill is ſcarce credible: it was very ſteep in its aſcent, and high, and no path where two could go a-breaſt: but they were obliged to pull them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up by the ſtumps and boughs of trees, that covered the declivity.</p>
                                 <p>Immediately after our victory over their troops, I ſent up all the boats in the fleet with artillery, and ammunition; and on the 17th went up with the men of war in a diſpoſition to attack the lower town, as ſoon as General <hi>Townſhend</hi> ſhould be ready to attack the upper; but in the evening they ſent out to the camp and offered terms of capitulation.</p>
                                 <p>I have the farther pleaſure of acquainting you, that during this tedious campaign there has continued a perfect good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding between the army and the navy. I have received great aſſiſtance from Admirals <hi>Durell</hi> and <hi>Holmes,</hi> and from all the captains: Indeed every body has exerted themſelves in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their duty; even the tranſports have willingly aſſiſted me with boats and people on the landing the troops, and many other ſervices.</p>

ſuperior army, by leſs than 7000 men. In this conteſt with ſo many difficulties, one may ſay with nature itſelf, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the commander ſhewed itſelf ſuperior to every thing.

                        <p>When the news of this deciſive action arrived in England, we all remember, though it is very difficult to deſcribe, the various and mixed emotions with which every one was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. But two days before this came, was received the expreſs which General Wolfe had ſent off after the affair of Montmorenci. When the general doubted, the public thought they had reaſon to deſpair. But whilſt this gloom was freſh and in the midſt of the general deſpondency; a ſecond expreſs arrives, and brings all at once an account of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:1261701201:259"/>
the victory, the taking of Quebec, and the death of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Wolfe. The effect of ſo joyful news, immediately on ſuch a dejection, and then the mixture of grief and pity, which attended the public congratulations and applauſes, was very ſingular and affecting. The ſort of mourning triumph, that manifeſted itſelf on that occaſion, did equal honour to the memory of the General, and to the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the nation.</p>
                        <p>A little circumſtance was talked of at that time, and it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be recorded, as it ſhews a firmneſs of ſentiment, and a juſtneſs of thinking, in the lower kind of people, that is rarely met with even amongſt perſons of education.

The miniſter himſelf made the motion for this purpoſe in the houſe of commons, and all the force of eloquence was diſplayed in ſetting off theſe ſervices in their proper light.

                        <p>It is not known with certainty in what manner the French diſpoſed of the remainder of their army after the battle of Quebec. It is probable that they retired towards Montreal and Trois Rivieres, the only places of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence which they had left in Canada. In order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of ſubſiſtence in any attempt they might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to make towards the recovery of Quebec in the winter, the country along the river was laid waſte for a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1261701201:260"/>
very conſiderable extent. A meaſure, which for the ſake of humanity, we could have wiſhed not to have been found neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt the operations were thus ſucceſsfully carried on in the river St. Laurence, General Amherſt was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his endeavours on the ſide of Lake Champlain. Though the retreat of the French from Crown Point and Ticonderoga had left him entirely maſter of Lake George, he found that the command of Lake Champlain was ſtill an object of ſome difficulty. Mr. Bourlemaque, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in that part, had retired to the Iſle de Noix, at the bottom of the lake, where he had three thouſand five hundred men ſtrongly entrenched; he had likewiſe four ſtout armed ſloops, by which he could eaſily defeat any attempts by boats.</p>
                        <p>General Amherſt found it neceſſary to attain a naval ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority upon the Champlain, before he could hope to puſh his operations any further; but this was a work of ſo much time, that it made it abſolutely impoſſible to attain the great end of the campaign, the communication with Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Wolfe, who was left in the manner we have ſeen to the exertion of his ſingle ſtrength. The naval preparations were not perfectly accompliſhed before the 10th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. They conſiſted of a great radeau, eighty four feet in length, and twenty in breadth, which carried ſix twenty-four pounders; the reſt conſiſted of a brigantine and a ſloop.</p>
                        <p>Covered by theſe the army was embarked in boats in a moſt excellent diſpoſition, and proceeded a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable way up the lake;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Oct. 11."/> 

 but as the ſeaſon was far advanced, and the weather growing cold and tempeſtuous, he judged it highly dangerous to venture his troops much upon the water in open batteaux; for the waves run as high on this lake as at ſea in an hard gale of wind. Beſides, he could not hope at this advanced ſeaſon to act at ſuch a diſtance as the Iſle de Noix with any effect; he therefore wiſely poſtponed his operations on that ſide to another year, and contented himſelf for the preſent with the efforts of his little marine, which exerted itſelf with great activity; they blocked up two of the enemies ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt veſſels in a bay, but the French abandoned them in the night,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Oct. 15."/> 

 and ſunk them in a deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the crews making their eſcape; theſe they
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:1261701201:261"/>
were in hopes to weigh up. The French appearing no where to oppoſe them, the armed ſloops returned to Crown Point ſoon after the troops,

 which were diſpoſed in winter quarters.</p>
                        <p>The memorable and vigorous campaign of 1759, which made full amends for the inactivity of the former, was thus happily cloſed. By the taking of Niagara, Ticonderago, and above all, Quebec, the French, in the little remaining part of Canada, are inveſted upon every ſide. The troops which they have under Mr. Levy at Montreal, and thoſe under Mr. Bourlemaque at Iſle de Noix, can neither be recruited with men, nor properly ſupplied with military ſtores, all communication with France being cut off. So that in the opening of the next campaign, if they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked with vigour from the ſide of Quebec, whilſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Amherſt advances with his body by Lake Champlain, of which he has now the entire dominion, the reſiſtance will be no more than ſufficient to give reputation to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; and it will depend more upon our own ſentiments of convenience what part of North America we ſhall leave to France, than to any efforts they may make in that part of the world; happy if our European ſyſtem ſhould ſo far concur, as to leave us free to conclude a peace in America upon its own merits.</p>

                        <p>WE took notice, in the preceeding part of our narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, of that movement of the king of Pruſſia, by which he got between the Ruſſians and Great Glogau, and thereby baffled their deſign upon that important place. This movement, at once daring, prudent and neceſſary, hindered the Ruſſians from taking winter quarters in his dominions; but at the ſame time it unavoidably cut off all communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the army of Prince Henry.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="224" facs="tcp:1261701201:262"/>That Prince, ſeeing that he could not ſecond the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the King, his brother, on the ſide of Sileſia, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived another expedient of co-operating with him, which was immediately to direct his march towards Saxony. There was no object, the poſſeſſion of which was more intereſting; on that account it was very proper; but this march anſwered alſo another end; for it drew the attention of M. Daun to the ſide of Saxony, and diſabled him from aſſiſting the deſigns of the Ruſſians againſt Glogau, either with his whole army, or with any conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment from it. The whole country of Luſatia, through which this projected march lay, was in a manner overſpread with the enemy. M. Daun, with the main army of the Auſtrians, lay at a place called Sorau, oppoſite to the prince's camp. Five bodies of Ruſſians occupied as many advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous poſts between the Bober and the Neiſs. General Laudohn poſſeſſed the whole country along the Spree, with ſeveral Auſtrian corps. To get round M. Daun, it was neceſſary to make a vaſt circuit, and to march between the Auſtrian and Ruſſian armies for more than ſixty Engliſh miles.</p>
                        <p>Before the prince entered upon this arduous deſign, by ſeveral bold movements he obliged M. Daun to retreat from Sorau to Gorlitz, and from Gorlitz as far as Bautzen, keeping himſelf as much as poſſible between the prince and Saxony. But his Royal Highneſs having perceived the direction in which M. Daun was moving, made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs to the northward of the Auſtrians, into the Lower Luſatia, paſſed the Neiſs at Rothenburg, and marching with the utmoſt expedition arrived at Hoyers Werda in two days from his leaving his poſts near Zittau.

 This rapid march brought them quite unexpected upon a body of five or ſix thouſand Auſtrian irregulars, commanded by General Vehla, who were ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in all ſecurity behind the town. They were routed with no ſmall ſlaughter. Having diſlodged this corps, the prince's army had leiſure to repoſe themſelves after ſuch a fatiguing march, for two days; and then continued their progreſs towards the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>The Pruſſian army, from the beginning of this war, has been particularly diſtinguiſhed for its marches; and there is certainly nothing in all the various operations of war, which more particularly diſtinguiſhes good troops, and able and ſpirited leaders. But this march of prince Henry over ſuch a tract of country, almoſt every where occupied by the enemy, in ſo ſhort a time, and with ſo little loſs, is perhaps one of the moſt extraordinary, and the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, of the marches, that have been made by the Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, or any other army.</p>
                        <p>This fortunate ſtroke, together with the retreat of the Ruſſians, afforded ſome hope, that notwithſtanding his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated diſaſters, the King of Pruſſia might ſtill conclude the campaign to his advantage. The detachments under Finck and Wunſch had no ſooner entered Miſnia, than they attained a ſuperiority over the united armies of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria and the Empire; all the places which in ſo ſhort a time they had ſeized, in as ſhort a time were reduced to the obedience of their former maſters. Wunſch had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged their army, and defeated one of its wings. This victory gave them the poſſeſſion of every thing to the gates of Dreſden, the only town which remained to the enemy of all thoſe they had taken.

Dawn fell back towards Dreſden. All the King of Pruſſia's poſts were left unmoleſted, and after all his loſſes, and all his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary detachments, he ſtill ſaw himſelf at the head of a gallant army of ſixty thouſand men, in high ſpirits, and ready to execute the moſt deſperate of his orders, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the advanced ſeaſon, and the great extremity of the cold.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="226" facs="tcp:1261701201:264"/>It is true, that M. Daun was ſuperior to him in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and yet more ſo in ſituation. He could at any time take poſſeſſion of the famous camp at Pirna, where he could not be attacked with any proſpect of ſucceſs; but then the freezing of the Elbe, the ſnow on the mountains which divide Bohemia from Saxony, and the continual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtations which might be expected from the Pruſſian par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, made this ſituation as dangerous, in ſome reſpects, as it was deſirable in others.</p>
                        <p>It was the opinion of many, that theſe advantages on the ſide of the King of Pruſſia, well purſued without aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at more, would in a ſhort time infallibly have obliged M. Daun to relinquiſh his ſtrong poſt, and to retire into Bohemia, abandoning Dreſden, and with it all the fruits of his victorious campaign. But the King, poſſeſſed by an idea of the ill ſituation of the Auſtrians, thought that advantages of greater moment, and more deciſive, might he drawn from it. He knew, that the paſſes into Bohemia were ſo difficult, that by ſome poſts properly choſen and ſtrongly guarded, the ſubſiſtence of the Auſtrians might be made impracticable, and even their retreat rendered ſo difficult, that M. Daun would find himſelf compelled to fight at a diſadvantage, and to put to the hazard of the field, all that his caution and prudence had been ſo long and ſo painfully procuring.</p>
                        <p>Upon this plan the King, having obliged M. Daun to retreat as far as Plauen, advanced himſelf as far as Keſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf; and ordered General Finck, with a ſtrong corps, to turn the Auſtrians, and ſeize the defiles of Maxen and Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendorf, through which alone it ſeemed poſſible for the Auſtrians to communicate with Bohemia. This was ſo ſucceſsfully executed, that there appeared no doubt that the King had effectually ſecured one of his principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and had placed Daun between two fires.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt the Pruſſians enjoyed this ſecurity, M. Daun, who was aware of their deſign, had ſo occupied all the eminences about this rough and dangerous place, and all the paſſes into it, that the Pruſſians were hardly attacked, when their defeat ſeemed inevitable. It is probable that they had got too far into theſe defiles, and had not taken proper meaſures to ſecure a retreat, or any ſort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the grand army. They became too late ſenſible of their ſituation, and they made, for a whole day,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:1261701201:265"/>
the moſt intrepid efforts to diſengage themſelves from it; but they were foiled in every attempt, with conſiderable loſs of men, and of the moſt part of their artillery.</p>
                        <p>Night put a ſtop to the engagement; the Auſtrians em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed it effectually, to entangle the Pruſſians, by guarding with double ſtrength and vigilance, every avenue through which it was poſſible for them to eſcape. So that when the morning appeared,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Nov. 26."/> 

 they ſaw the hills covered upon every ſide with great bodies of their enemies, and every defile preſented a wall of bayonets, through which it was impoſſible to penetrate. Thus galled with the loſſes of the preceding day, in which it is ſaid they had exhauſted almoſt all their ammunition, ſtripped of the greateſt part of their cannon, ſurrounded by the enemy on all quarters, no reſource, no proſpect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief appearing, the army loſt all hope, and all ſpirit. To make any efforts in this condition, General Finck thought would only be to throw away unprofitably the lives of many brave men, which might be reſerved for a more hopeful occaſion; he therefore, notwithſtanding the known rigour of his maſter, the apparent ſhame of the thing, and the thouſand circumſtances of embarraſſment that muſt have ariſen to a man of honour at ſuch a juncture, came to a reſolution of ſurrendering the whole army priſoners of war. Nineteen battalions and thirty five ſquadrons, compoſing near twenty thouſand men by the Auſtrian account, above twelve by the Pruſſian confeſſion, ſixty-four pieces of cannon, many ſtandards and colours were taken on this occaſion.</p>
                        <p>It was unqueſtionably the greateſt blow which the Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians had felt from the beginning of the war; conſidering the critical time, the numbers taken, and the loſs of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which aroſe from the manner in which they were taken. It is no wonder, that ſuch an extraordinary advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, thus cheaply obtained, ſhould greatly have elevated the friends of the houſe of Auſtria. They had put the cheat upon the Pruſſians, they had caught their enemy in the very trap which they had laid, as they thought, with ſuch addreſs for them. They had now received a full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnification for the capture of the Saxon army, which had ſurrendered in much the ſame manner, and very near this place, in the year 1756.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="228" facs="tcp:1261701201:266"/>The King of Pruſſia had not time to recover from this ſtroke, under which he was yet ſtaggering, when he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another blow, and a ſevere one. General Durceke was poſted at the right of the Elbe, oppoſite to Meiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Dec. 4."/> 

 but on the approach of a large body of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrians, they prepared to retreat over the river into that place into which they thought their retreat ſecure; but having been obliged by an hard froſt to withdraw their bridge of boats, a thaw ſupervening, when they attempted to lay a bridge of pontoons, ſo many great fragments of ice floated in the river, that they found it impracticable; they were therefore under the neceſſity of paſſing over their army in boats. Whilſt they ſtruggled wirh theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, their rear guard was attacked by the Auſtrians with great fury, and all the men that compoſed it, together with the General, were killed or made priſoners. The loſs of the Pruſſians on this occaſions is ſaid to have been three thouſand killed and taken; and this ſecond ſurprize brought a new diſcredit, as well as a great detriment to the Pruſſian arms.</p>
                        <p>M. Daun was not ſo carried away with this flood of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as to depart in the leaſt degree from his uſual cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous management. Two advantages were now obtained, which, with a very few efforts, might be improved, to the entire deſtruction of the King of Pruſſia. At leaſt, many Generals would have thought ſo; but M. Daun thought that the ſame conduct, which, with no riſque, and with little loſs, had reduced the King ſo low, was the moſt likely, if purſued, to bring on his entire ruin. He reſolved to give that monarch no ſort of chance to recover his fortune; Daun, after the two great victories he had himſelf newly obtained, retired behind Dreſden; and as if he had been beaten, as often as he was victorious, he took refuge in the impregnable camp at Pirna, having ſo diſpoſed matters, that the King of Pruſſia, now to weak to ſend out any great detachments, could not prevent his communication with Bohemia.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt the King of Pruſſia carried on his unſucceſsful campaign in Saxony, through all the rigours of the ſevereſt winter for many years felt in Europe; the army of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies kept the field with better fortune. It is true, things had been ſo diſpoſed by the obſtinate reſiſtance of Munſter,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1261701201:267"/>
and the reinforcements which arrived in the French army, that Prince Ferdinand did not find himſelf in a condition to force them to a deciſive action; and therefore the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the two armies had continued much the ſame for a conſiderable time. At length Munſter, after a ſeries of operations, ſometimes a ſiege, ſometimes a block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade, now broken off, and now reſumed,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Nov. 20."/> 

 at laſt ſurrendered, and the garriſon capitulated for their liberty.</p>
                        <p>Not long after this, the Hereditary Prince of Brunſwick, all whoſe enterpriſes are diſtinguiſhed with a peculiar eclat and ſplendor, that mark them for his own, performed a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that curbed the French, even more than the loſs of Munſter. Prince Charles of Bevern was alſo engaged in this deſign.</p>
                        <p>The Duke of Wurtemburg had renewed his treaty of ſubſidy with France, and having recruited and augmented his troops, he lay at Fulda, a great way to the right of the French army. The Hereditary Prince formed a deſign to attack him at that diſtance.</p>
                        <p>On the 28th of November, taking a ſmall, but well choſen corps of horſe and foot, and diſengaging them from their baggage, he arrived in two days at Fulda, where the Wurtemburgers enjoyed themſelves in full ſecurity. A <hi>feu de joye</hi> had been ordered for that day; the troops were all in their beſt cloaths; the Duke had invited all the ladies in the town to his table, and to a ball, which he intended to have given that very day; but the Hereditary prince diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted their meaſures, both of war and diverſion. A large party of the Wurtemburg troops were poſted in a plain before the town. The Hereditary Prince fell upon them unawares in their front and flank, and drove them into the town, into which he cloſely purſued them. Here they made ſome appearance of maintaining their ground for ſome minutes, but they were ſoon driven out on the other ſide, and hotly purſued by the Prince of Brunſwick; without the town they were met by Prince Charles of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, who had made a compaſs about the place, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked them vigorouſly as ſoon as they had got out of it. Four battalions made ſome reſiſtance, and were all cut to pieces or made priſoners; the reſt, with the Duke himſelf, covered by the reſiſtance of theſe battalions, made a ſhift to eſcape. Above a thouſand priſoners were made on this
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1261701201:268"/>
occaſion; and the Prince returned to the camp of the allies, after having effectually diſabled this corps from performing any thing conſiderable; and this action was of the greateſt conſequence, as, by the diſpoſition of that corps at Fulda, there was an appearance as if the French meant to form a communication with the army of the Empire, for the mutual extenſion and ſecurity of their winter quarters.</p>
                        <p>This enterpriſe was only the prelude to another, which promiſed to be much more extenſive in its conſequences. The ſeaſon was now grown too ſevere to ſuffer the allies to puſh any further the advantages they had obtained over the French; at the ſame time it diſabled the French from attempting any thing conſiderable againſt them. Beſides theſe advantages of the ſeaſon, by poſſeſſing Munſter, the allies were no longer obliged to keep ſo large a body of men in Weſtphalia. Theſe were the conſiderations which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Prince Ferdinand to turn his eyes to the diſtreſſed ſtate of the King of Pruſſia's affairs. After the two great blows which that monarch had ſuffered, there was no hope of diſlodging M. Daun with his ſingle force; and he was utterly unable to avail himſelf as heretofore, of the rigour of the ſeaſon, to ſtrike a deciſive blow. Prince Ferdinand, diſtant as he was from his diſtreſſed ally, and ſo near to an enemy ſuperior in numbers, did not heſitate to ſend him ſuccours, to enable him, if poſſible, to make a final effort. He detached therefore 12,000 of his beſt men, and placed them under the command of the Hereditary Prince, with whoſe vigour and diligence he was perfectly acquainted, and under whom he knew the ſoldiers would endure any hardſhip with chearfulneſs. They marched from Korſdorff,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Oct. 11."/> 

 and in the depth of the late ſevere ſeaſon, without loſing a man by ſickneſs or deſertion, in fifteen days, marched near three hundred miles, and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King of Pruſſia at Freybourg.</p>
                        <p>This junction raiſed for a while the ſpirits and hopes of the Pruſſian army, but, in effect, it did more honour to the abilities of the Hereditary Prince, than ſervice to the King. The ſeaſon which fought equally againſt all ſides, the inacceſſible camp at Pirna, and the caution of M. Daun, rendered it impoſſible for the King, notwithſtanding this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement, to make any attempt. So that after ſeveral movements in hopes of bringing the Auſtrians to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, he was obliged at length to deſiſt, and to ſuffer

                        <p>The King of Pruſſia did not derive the benefits that were expected from this detachment; the French had no ſooner notice of it, than they attempted to avail them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the weakneſs it cauſed in the allied army.

                        <p>THE ſeverity of the winter could not put a ſtop to the operations of the land armies; it had no more effect upon the operations at ſea, which went on with vigour, in ſpight of the inclemency of the ſeaſon. The invaſion projected by France, which the engagement off Cape Lagos had retarded, was by no means laid aſide.</p>
                        <p>The preparations for a naval equipment in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Breſt, and for tranſporting a body of forces from
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1261701201:270"/>
Vannes, went on continually. The winter did not delay theſe preparations, becauſe it was hoped that in that ſeaſon, the Britiſh fleet might be obliged to take refuge in their own harbours; and thus might afford an opportunity for the French fleet to come out unoppoſed, and to execute the object of their deſtination before the Britiſh navy could be in readineſs to encounter them.</p>
                        <p>In fact, they were not wholly diſappointed in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. A violent ſtorm forced Sir Edward Hawke to quit his ſtation off Breſt. He came with his whole fleet to anchor in Torbay.</p>
                        <p>The French fleet availed itſelf of his abſence to put to ſea.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Nov. 14."/> 

 The whole Engliſh nation was alarmed; but it was an alarm which produced no hurry or diſturbance, but vigorous, cool, and ſettled methods for defence.</p>
                        <p>And now the event of the whole war was put to the iſſue; for upon the good or ill ſucceſs of this ſtroke every thing depended. Admiral Hawke loſt not a moment's time to put again to ſea,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Nov. 14."/> 

 and to ſeek the French fleet. Both ſquadrons put to ſea on the ſame day; Sir Edward Hawke from Torbay, M. de Conflans from Breſt. There was a difference of but one ſhip of the line in their forces.</p>
                        <p>It is impoſſible here to paſs over the gallant behaviour of one of our Admirals, as it helps to mark the genius and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rip of this happy time, and as this is one of the fineſt inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it. Admiral Saunders came into port from his Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec expedition immediately after Hawke had ſailed. After ſuch a long voyage and ſo ſevere a campaign, unbroken by fatigue, and ſtill inſatiated with glory, he determined im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to ſet ſail again, and partake the honour and danger of the coming engagement. For this purpoſe no time was to be loſt, and he had no orders. But he thought the exigencies of his country ſufficient orders; and he knew that at this time the letter of military diſcipline would never be ſet againſt its ſpirit. He therefore ſet ſail without waiting for orders with ten ſhips; but fortune did not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the generoſity of his intentions, and he did not join the Britiſh fleet time enough for the engagement.</p>
                        <p>As Sir Edward Hawke concluded that the firſt rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous of the enemy's fleet would be at Quiberon, he direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his courſe with all diligence for that bay. But here
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1261701201:271"/>
again fortune for a while ſeemed to declare for the French; for a ſtrong wind blown in an eaſterly point, drove the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh fleet a great way to the weſtward; but at length it became more favourable, and bore them in directly to the ſhore. About eight o'clock the headmoſt ſhips diſcovered the enemy bearing to the northward, between the iſland of Belleiſle and the main land of France.</p>
                        <p>Hawke ſaw at laſt what he had ſo long, and ſo ardently wiſhed for, (though hitherto in vain) the enemy in his reach. But yet there were ſuch difficulties in his way, as would have checked a very cautious commander, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps any commander in circumſtances leſs critical to the public ſafety. On the ſlighteſt inſpection of the chart it will appear, that all this ſea is ſown thick with ſands and ſhoals, and ſhallows, and rocks; our pilots were by no means well acquainted with it; and the wind blew little leſs than a violent ſtorm, and the waves ran mountain high. In theſe circumſtances they were to attack a very ſtrong ſquadron of the enemy on their own coaſt, with which they were perfectly acquainted. All theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties only animated the Engliſh Admiral. In one of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſhips in the world, commanding the flower of the Britiſh navy, and ſeconded by ſome of the moſt tried and braveſt officers in the ſervice; and above all not dubious of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He ordered the ſhips neareſt the enemy immediately to chaſe, and, by engaging them, to give time for the reſt of the fleet to come up.</p>
                        <p>M. Conflans had two choices, either to fly, or to ſtand and fight it out. But he followed neither perfectly; for ſome time he appeared as if he meant to fight; but after giving the Britiſh ſhips time to come near him, when it was too late, he crouded all the ſail he could carry; at the ſame time he ſhewed an attention to keep his ſquadron toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>At half an hour after two, the action began with great fury. In two hours the enemy had loſt three ſhips of the line, one ſtruck, two were ſunk outright. Hawke ordered his ſhip to reſerve her fire, to paſs by all the others, and to be laid along ſide of the Soleil Royal, the beſt ſhip in the French navy, and commanded by M. de Conflans; the maſter remonſtrated on the almoſt inevitable danger of the coaſt. Hawke anſwered,
<q>You have done your duty in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance; now obey my orders, and lay me along
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1261701201:272"/>
ſide the French admiral.</q>
A French ſhip of 70 guns generouſly put himſelf between them; Hawke was obliged to beſtow here the fire he had reſerved for a greater occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and at one broadſide ſunk her to the bottom. The headmoſt of the Engliſh ſhips fired on the enemy as they came up to them, and then paſſed on to others, leaving thoſe behind to improve their ſucceſs, and deſtroy or take them; and by this method they had got up quite to the van of the enemy, and would have totally deſtroyed their fleet, had not night interpoſed to ſave them. Before night came on, the enemy's fleet was much diſperſed; but in the eagerneſs of the purſuit, two of the Engliſh ſhips unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately run upon a ſand, called the Four, and were loſt. The enemy fled in to their own coaſt. Seven ſhips of the line threw overboard all their guns, and eſcaped into the River Villaine; about as many more got out to ſea, and made for other ports.</p>
                        <p>Nothing could be conceived more dreadful than the night which ſucceeded this action. A violent ſtorm blew all night long. It was a pitchy darkneſs; a dangerous coaſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded them on almoſt all ſides. A continual firing of diſtreſs guns was heard, without knowing whether they came from friend or enemy; and on account of the badneſs of the coaſt and the darkneſs of the night, our people were equally unable to venture to their aſſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>When morning came on, they found the French Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral had run his ſhip, and another called the Heros, on ſhore; the firſt was ſet on fire by the enemy, the other by our ſeamen. Thus concluded this remarkable action <hi rend="sup">(c)</hi>

, in
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1261701201:273"/>
which the French had four capital ſhips deſtroyed, one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the whole of their formidable navy, in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the laſt hope of their marine, ſhattered, diſarmed, and diſperſed. The long threatned invaſion which was
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1261701201:274"/>
to repair their loſſes in every part of the world, was diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, and the credit of their arms broken along with their forces. The behaviour of the Engliſh captains and ſeamen,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1261701201:275"/>
on the contrary, added as much to the glory of the Britiſh arms, as to the ſafety of their country. Perhaps there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was a naval engagement of ſuch extent, in which no
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1261701201:276"/>
captain was accuſed, nor even in any degree ſuſpected of miſbehaviour or cowardice; in which thoſe who engaged, and thoſe who did not, gave proofs that they were equally ardent in the ſervice of their country.</p>

we chaſed them, their ſquadron conſiſted, according to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying liſt, of four ſhips of 80, ſix of 74, three of 70, eight of 64, one frigate of 36, one of 34, and one of 16 guns, with a ſmall veſſel to look out. They ſailed from <hi>Breſt</hi> the 24th inſt. the ſame day I ſailed from <hi>Toybay.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Concluding that their firſt rendevous ſhould be <hi>Quiberon,</hi> the inſtant I received the intelligence, I directed my courſe thither with a preſt ſail. At the firſt wind blowing hard, at S. by E. and S. drove us conſiderably to the weſtward. But on the 18th and 19th, though variable, it proved more favourable. In the mean time, having been joined by the <hi>Maidſtone</hi> and <hi>Coventry</hi> frigates, I directed their commanders to keep a head of the ſquadron: one on the ſtarboard and the other on the larboard bow. At half paſt eight o'clock in the morning of the 20th, <hi>Belleiſle,</hi> by our reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bearing E. by N. one fourth N. the <hi>Maidſtone</hi> made the ſignal for ſeeing a fleet, I immediately ſpread abroad the ſignal for a line abreaſt, in order to draw all the ſhips of the ſquadron up with me. I had before ſent the <hi>Magnanime</hi> a head, to make the land. At three fourths paſt nine ſhe made ſignal for an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Obſerving, on my diſcovering them, that they made off, I threw out the ſignal, for the ſeven ſhips neareſt them to chaſe, and draw into a line of battle a-head of me, and endeavour to ſtop them till the reſt of the ſquadron ſhould come up, who were alſo to form as they chaſed, that no time might be loſt in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. That morning there were in chaſe the <hi>Rocheſter, Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Portland, Falkland, Minerva, Vengeance</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> all which joined me about eleven o'clock; and, in the evening, the <hi>Saphire</hi> from <hi>Quiberon</hi> bay. All the day we had very freſh gales, at N. W. and W. N. W. with heavy ſqualls.</p>
                                 <p>M. <hi>Conflans</hi> continued going off under ſuch ſail as his ſquadron could carry, and at the ſame time keep together, while we crowded after them with every ſail our ſhips could bear. At half pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 <p>By day-break of the 21ſt, we diſcovered one of our ſhips diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſted aſhore on our <hi>Four</hi>

, the <hi>French Heros</hi> alſo, and the <hi>Soleil Royal,</hi> which under cover of the night had anchored among us, cut and run aſhore to the weſtward of <hi>Crozie.</hi> On the latter's moving, I made the <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s ſignal to ſlip and purſue her, but ſhe unfortunately got upon the <hi>Four,</hi> and both ſhe and the <hi>Reſolution</hi> are irrecoverably loſt, notwithſtanding we ſent them all the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that the weather would permit. About fourſcore of the <hi>Reſolution</hi>'s company, in ſpite of the ſtrongeſt remonſtrahces of their captain, made rafts, and, with ſeveral <hi>French</hi> priſoners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Formidable,</hi> put off, and I am afraid, drove out to ſea. All the <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s are ſaved (with as many of the ſtores as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) except one lieutenant and a boat's crew, who were drove on the <hi>French</hi> ſhore, and have not been heard of: the remains of both ſhips have been ſet on fire. We found the <hi>Dorſetſhire, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> and <hi>Defiance,</hi> in the night of the 20th put out to ſea; as I hope the <hi>Swiftſure</hi> did, for ſhe is ſtill miſſing. The <hi>Dorſetſhire</hi> and <hi>Defiance</hi> returned next day, and the latter ſaw the <hi>Revenge</hi> without. Thus, what loſs we have ſuſtained has been owing to the weather not the enemy, ſeven or eight of whoſe line of battle ſhips got to ſea, I believe, the night of the action.</p>
                                 <p>As ſoon as it was broad day-light in the morning of the 21ſt, I diſcovered ſeven or eight of the enemy's line of battle ſhips at anchor, between <hi>Point Penris,</hi> and the river <hi>Villaine;</hi> on which I made the ſignal to weigh, in order to work up and attack them; but it blowed ſo hard from the N. W. that inſtead of daring to caſt the ſquadron looſe, I was obliged to ſtrike top gallant maſts. 
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1261701201:275"/>
Moſt of thoſe ſhips appeared to be a-ground at low water; but on the flood, by lightening them, and the advantage of the wind under the land, all except two got that night into the river <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>The weather being moderate on the 22d, I ſent the <hi>Portland, Chatham,</hi> and <hi>Vengeance</hi> to deſtroy the <hi>Soleil Royal</hi> and <hi>Heros.</hi> The <hi>French,</hi> on the approach of our ſhips, ſet the firſt on fire, and ſoon after the latter met the ſame fate from our people. In the mean time I got under way, and worked up within <hi>Penris Point,</hi> as well for the ſake of its being a ſafer road, as to deſtroy, if poſſible, the two ſhips of the enemy which ſtill lay without the <hi>Villaine;</hi> but before the ſhips I ſent a-head for that purpoſe could get near them, being quite light, and with the tide of flood, they got in.</p>
                                 <p>All the 23d we were employed in reconnoitring the entrance of that river, which is very narrow, and only twelve feet water on the bar, at low water. We diſcovered at leaſt ſeven, if not eight, line of battle ſhips about half a mile within, quite light, and two large frigates moored acroſs, to defend the mouth of the river; only the frigates appeared to have guns in.</p>
                                 <p>By evening I had twelve long boats fitted as fire-ſhips, ready to attempt burning them, under convoy of the <hi>Saphire</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry;</hi> but the weather being bad, and the wind contrary, oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to defer it, till at leaſt the latter ſhould be favourable; if they can, by any means be deſtroyed, it ſhall be done.</p>
                                 <p>In attacking a flying enemy, it was impoſſible in the ſpace of a ſhort winter's day, that all our ſhips ſhould be able to get into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or all thoſe of the enemy brought to it. The commanders and companies of ſuch as did come up with the rear of the <hi>French,</hi> on the 20th, behaved with the greateſt intrepidity, and gave the ſtrongeſt proof of a true <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſpirit. In the ſame manner I am ſatisfied, would thoſe have acquitted themſelves, whoſe bad go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhips, or the diſtance they were at in the morning, prevented from getting up. Our loſs by the enemy is not conſiderable; for in the ſhips which are now with me, I find only one lieutenant, and 39 ſeamen and marines killed, and about 202 wounded. When I conſider the ſeaſon of the year, the hard gales of wind on the day of action, a flying enemy, the ſhortneſs of the day, and the coaſt we are on, I can boldly affirm, that all that poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly could be done, has been done. As to the loſs we have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, 
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1261701201:276"/>
let it be placed to the neceſſity I was under of running all riſks to break this ſtrong force of the enemy: had we had but two hours more day-light, the whole had been totally deſtroyed or taken, for we were almoſt up with their van when night overtook us.</p>
                                 <p>Yeſterday came in here the <hi>Pallas, Fortune</hi> ſloop, and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerpine</hi> fire-ſhip. On the 16th I had diſpatched the <hi>Fortune</hi> to <hi>Quebec,</hi> with directions to captain <hi>Duff,</hi> to keep directly on his guard. In his way thither he fell in with the <hi>Phebe,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of 40 guns, under jury-maſts, and fought her ſeveral hours. During the engagement lieutenant <hi>Stuart,</hi> 2d of the <hi>Ramilies,</hi> whom I had appointed to command her, was unfortunately killed; the ſurviving officers, on conſulting together, reſolved to leave her, as ſhe proved too ſtrong for them. I have detached captain <hi>Young</hi> to <hi>Quiberon</hi> bay with five ſhips, and am making up a flying ſquadron to ſcour the coaſt to the iſle of <hi>Aix,</hi> and if practicable, to attempt any of the enemy's ſhips that may be there.</p>

                           <pb n="239" facs="tcp:1261701201:277"/>Thoſe who think ſuch matters deſerving of their notice, have obſerved, that this deciſive naval engagement, the ſurrender of the Pruſſian troops at Maxen, and the taking of Munſter, happened on the ſame day, the 20th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="240" facs="tcp:1261701201:278"/>This was the concluſion of the French affairs in Europe. The iſſue of the campaign in America had not been more favourable to them. Although the events in the Eaſt Indies belong properly to the laſt year, yet, as the accounts did not arrive until this, and that the actions there were of great importance, and equally fortunate on our ſide, it is proper that we ſhould take ſome notice of them here.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="241" facs="tcp:1261701201:279"/>The Engliſh had by no means that ſuperiority over the French in the Eaſt Indies, which they had in America. It was here the French ſeemed to have made thoſe efforts, by which they hoped in ſome degree to ballance their loſſes in other parts. They had a very ſtrong ſquadron under M. d'Ache in thoſe ſeas. M. de Lally, an officer of credit, and of greater rank than had uſually been ſent on that ſervice, commanded a body of 2000 Europeans, a great army, in a country where the name of an European is itſelf a ſtrength.</p>
                        <p>In the beginning, their ſucceſs ſeemed proportioned to their forces; they took the fort and city of St. David's. But in a very ſhort time the ill ſtar of France, which in no part of the world ſet well on their affairs, began to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence them here. M. d'Ache, in two naval engagements, was worſted, and prevented from co-operating with the land forces for the reſt of the campaign. And had the ſpirit and conduct of Admiral Pococke been as well ſeconded by ſome of his captains, as it was by others, there is great reaſon to believe, that the French naval power had been as effectually deſtroyed in thoſe ſeas, as it had been in thoſe of Europe.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding theſe checks, it was neceſſary that M. Lally ſhould act. But it was not only the diſgrace of the French fleet, but an extreme want of money which delayed his operations. A Prince of the country, the King of Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jour, appeared the only reſource which was open. To this prince he applied for a conſiderable ſum of money, which being abſolutely refuſed, he carried the war into his dominions, and laid ſiege to his capital city. But after lying ſeveral days before it, and after having even made a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable breach, the ſkill of ſome Engliſh gunners, the want of proviſions and ammunition, and the diſorders which reigned in his army, obliged him to return without the money, and with the mortification of being beaten from a place, only fortified after the Indian manner.</p>
                        <p>This failure in their pecuniary expectations, and their repulſe from an Indian town, were bad encouragements to the undertaking of an enterprize againſt an European ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and a fortification in ſome degree regular. But having ſeized upon a Dutch veſſel, as it is thought much with its own conſent, which contained a large treaſure, they ſet out at length to beſiege Madraſs. But here their ſucceſs
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1261701201:280"/>
was no better than at Tanjour, though their ſtrength was greater, and their efforts much more obſtinate.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Draper and Major Brereton defended the place with the utmoſt ſkill and bravery. Mr. Pigot likewiſe with equal generoſity and prudence, ſeconded their endeavours, by the ſupplies of ſtores and ammunition, which were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably diſtributed, and co-operated with the military with a firmneſs and intrepidity, by which he obtained an honour equal to any in the defence of the place. Whilſt the town was defended with great ſpirit within; parties were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſent out, which ſo infeſted the roads through which the enemy's convoys were to paſs, that their army in the trenches were infinitely weakened by the detachments which they were obliged to ſend out. After a ſiege of more than two months, they were obliged to abandon their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, and by that means renounce for ever all thoſe ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine hopes, which they had entertained from the forces in this part of the world. The Engliſh, on the contrary, went on from ſucceſs to ſucceſs. Whilſt they defeated the French on the Eaſtern coaſt of the great peninſula of India, on the weſtern they took the great and opulent city of Surat from the powers of the country, with very little loſs.</p>
                        <p>General Lally left Madraſs in the utmoſt tranſports of rage and deſpair, which a man of honour and ability in his profeſſion can feel, who is ill ſeconded by his troops, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by thoſe who ought to ſupport him, and cheated by the villainy of contractors, and of all thoſe who turn war into a low traffic. <hi rend="sup">(a)</hi>

                                 <p>A Good blow might be ſtruck here: There is a ſhip in the road of 20 guns, laden with all the riches of Madraſs, which it is ſaid will remain there till the 20th. The <hi>Expedition</hi> is juſt arrived, but M. <hi>Gorlin</hi> is not a man to attack her: for ſhe has made him run away once before. The <hi>Briſtol</hi> on the other hand did but juſt make her appearance before St. Thomas; and on the vague report of thirteen ſhips coming from Porto Novo, ſhe took fright; and after landing the proviſions with which ſhe was laden, ſhe would not ſtay long enough even to take on board twelve of her own guns, which ſhe had lent us for the ſiege.</p>
                                 <pb n="243" facs="tcp:1261701201:281"/>
                                 <p>If I was the judge of the point of honour of the company's officers, I would break him like glaſs, as well as ſome others of them.</p>
                                 <p>The <hi>Fidelle,</hi> or <hi>Harlem,</hi> or even the aforeſaid <hi>Briſtol,</hi> with the twelve guns reſtored to her, would be ſufficient to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves maſters of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhip, if they could manage ſo as to get to the windward of her in the night. <hi>Maugendie</hi> and <hi>Tremil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> are ſaid to be good men; and were they employed only to tranſport 200 wounded men, that we have here, their ſervice would be of importance.</p>
                                 <p>We remain ſtill in the ſame poſition: the breach made theſe fifteen days; all the time within fifteen toiſes of the wall of the place, and never holding up our heads to look at it.</p>
                                 <p>I reckon we ſhall at our arrival at <hi>Pondicherry</hi> endeavour to learn ſome other trade, for this of war requires too much patience.</p>
                                 <p>Of 1500 <hi>Cipays</hi> which attend our army, I reckon near 800 are employed upon the road to <hi>Pondicherry,</hi> laden with ſugar, pepper, and other goods; and as for the <hi>Caulis</hi> they are all employed for the ſame purpoſe, from the firſt day we came here.</p>
                                 <p>I am taking my meaſures from this day to ſet fire to the <hi>Black Town,</hi> and to blow up the powder mills.</p>
                                 <p>You will never imagine, that 50 <hi>French</hi> deſerters, and 100 <hi>Swiſs,</hi> are actually ſtopping the progreſs of 2000 men of the King's and Company's troops, which are ſtill here exiſting, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the exaggerated accounts that every one makes here, according to his own fancy, of the ſlaughter that has been of them; and you will be ſtill more ſurprized, if I tell you, that, were it not for the two combats and four battles we ſuſtained, and for the batteries which failed, or to ſpeak more properly, which were unſkilfully made, we ſhould not have loſt 50 men, from the commencement of the ſiege to this day.</p>
                                 <p>I have wrote to M. <hi>de Larche,</hi> that if he perſiſts in not coming here, let who will raiſe money upon the Paleagers for me, I will not do it: And I renounce (as I informed you a month ago I would do) meddling directly or indirectly with any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that may have relation to your adminiſtration, whether civil or military. For I had rather go, and command the <hi>Caffres</hi> of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> than remain in this <hi>Sodom;</hi> which it is impoſſible but the fire of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>

His letter is a ſtrong and very ſtriking
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1261701201:281"/>
picture of theſe agitations; and certainly it is worthy of remark, that every where there ſhould appear ſomething more unaccountably wrong and weak in the management of the French, than has been in the conduct of that or almoſt any other nation at any time. It ſeems to argue an

eſſential and radical fault in ſome ſuperior part of their government, more eaſily indeed viſible in its conſequences, than diſcoverable in its cauſe.</p>
                        <p>In Europe they received offers of peace from the Kings of Great Britain and Pruſſia. But as they did not expect, from their ſituation, very advantageous or honourable terms, they reſolved to act, in one inſtance, the Roman part, and ſtill hold out, determined to hazard the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities; perhaps, hoping ſomething favourable from the fortune of their allies, ſince their own had deſerted them; and reſolving to contract their plan, and to make one ſtrong effort in one part, rather than unprofitably to waſte their ſtrength upon ſevereal inferior objects. This effort could be made with any proſpect of ſucceſs only in Germany. <hi rend="sup">(a)</hi>

But the ſupplies neceſſary for this great charge were difficult to a nation, whoſe trade was wholly deſtroyed. On this occaſion they did not ſcruple to break in upon
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1261701201:284"/>
the public faith, and to find ſupplies for one year in an expedient, that ſtruck at the ſources of all future credit. They ſtopped the payment on many public bills and funds

They turn their whole at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to Germany, where they have very greatly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented their army, and placed it under a general, from whom they have ſome hopes, after their repeated diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, and the frequent changes they have made. They propoſe alſo another army under the prince de Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſe; if they can compaſs this latter project, as it is believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they may, the ſyſtem of Germany is ſtill in very immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger. For notwithſtanding the tried goodneſs of our troops, and the admirable commander at the head of them, it is certain, even with any reinforcements we may be able to ſend, we ſhall find it very difficult to contend with two armies, ſuppoſing that we ſhall have no other than French armies to contend with, and that the King of Pruſſia ſhould be able, as he has hitherto been, to find employment for the many, the powerful, and the implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enemies that ſurround him.</p>
                        <p>It is certain he is much reduced; and that his reſources are nearly exhauſted. Theſe are facts which cannot be concealed; and yet ſome glimmering of hopes may be ſtill perceived, when we conſider the admirable talents for war and government, which that monarch poſſeſſes; and when we conſider even the events of the laſt (to him) unfortunate campaign; where after having ſuffered four capital defeats, and having obtained no one conſiderable advantage, he has yet continued in ſome ſort ſuperior in the field; the enemy has not been able to make the leaſt impreſſion upon his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; and he has, at laſt, more than divided Saxony with them; the city of Dreſden is all that they poſſeſs in that country, and the acquiſition of which has been the only fruit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>As for Great Britain, ſhe has only to fear from her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections. In no one year ſince ſhe was a nation, has ſhe been favoured with ſo many ſucceſſes, both by ſea and land, and in every quarter of the globe; nor have her officers, both by ſea and land, ever done more honour to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ir ſkill and bravery. And with regard to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal adminiſtration, it ſuffices to ſay, that whilſt France became bankrupt, without delay or murmuring there have been more than ſix millions borrowed in England at a very
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:1261701201:286"/>
eaſy rate; and that the intereſt on this immenſe ſum has been made good by a ſingle tax upon malt, which will ſcarce be felt by the people. By this the reſources of England may be imagined; eſpecially if we conſider, that highly as we are taxed for the neceſſary charges of the war; we have not been prevented from great and expenſive vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary exertions of public ſpirit and beneficence. The cities of London and Weſtminſter, and after their example other towns made a large ſubſcription for enliſting ſoldiers. Subſcriptions were alſo carried on to a great amount, for cloathing the enemies priſoners, abandoned through the neglect or poverty of their ſovereign; and for adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the relief of the families of thoſe who had fallen in the battles of Quebec and Minden. Thus actuated by the warmeſt patriotiſm, which far from extinguiſhing, ſeemed to kindle a beneficence towards our enemies in their diſtreſs.</p>
                        <p>The condition of Europe, which all people thought would have been decided in this campaign, is nearly as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious as ever; and the difficulties which oppoſe themſelves to a peace are rather augmented than diminiſhed. Here then we cloſe the ſcene, and conclude the events of the preſent year; in the next we hope, notwithſtanding appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, after ſo many ſcenes of horror, to have the more pleaſing taſk of relating the ſteps taken to a general peace, on terms as particularly advantageous to our own country, as the mixed intereſts of Europe, and the various fortunes of the powers embarked in the ſame cauſe, will admit.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Nothing decided in the war. State of the ſeveral powers concerned. Great Britain and Pruſſia propoſe an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation.

                        </argument>
                        <p>IF all the wars which have harraſſed Europe for more than a century had not proved it, the events of the laſt campaigns muſt have ſatisfied every thinking man, that victories do not decide the fate of nations. Four moſt bloody, and to all appearance moſt ruinous defeats, which he ſuffered in that year, had deſpoiled the King of Pruſſia of no more than a ſingle town. After theſe accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated blows he ſtill found himſelf in a condition to make good his winter-quarters; to cover his dominions; and to tempt the favour of fortune in another campaign.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="250" facs="tcp:1261701201:290"/>To carry our attention a little further back; who could have imagined, that when the French had compelled the Hanoverian troops to lay down their arms, when they had thruſt them into a defenceleſs corner, had bound them down with the yoke of a ſtrict and ſevere capitulation, and had poſſeſſed themſelves of every place which could boaſt the ſmalleſt ſhare of ſtrength in the king's German dominions, that in a few months they ſhould find themſelves compelled to fly before their captives; and after having ſuffered a conſiderable defeat, ſhould be puſhed back almoſt on their own territories.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, it might have been ſuppoſed that the effects of theſe advantages under the management of a very great commander, who was beſides largely reinforced, could have been fruſtrated only by the loſs of ſome great battle. But the fact was otherwiſe. The Hanoverians, without any adverſe ſtroke in that campaign, were obliged to repaſs the Rhine and the Lippe; and ſince that time, fortune having decided nothing by the events of five years war, has given to Prince Ferdinand the poſſeſſion of a great part of Weſtphalia in the manner of a conquered country, and yet ſees him abandoning Heſſe, and with difficulty co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the borders of Hanover.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, the victory of Crevelt could not enable the Duke of Brunſwick to defend the Rhine. The battle of Bergen did not give M. Broglio an entrance into Hanover. The great victory of Minden did not drive the French from the Maine. We have ſeen armies, after complete victory, obliged to act as if they had been defeated; and after a defeat, taking an offenſive part with ſucceſs, and reaping all the fruits of victory.</p>
                        <p>Theſe reflections are ſtill more ſtrongly enforced by the fortune of the King of Pruſſia. Covered with the laurels of Lowoſitz, Prague, Roſbach and Liſſa, when he began after ſo many compleat triumphs, to purſue his advantages, and to improve ſucceſs into conqueſt, the ſcene was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly altered. As ſoon as he attempted to penetrate with effect into the enemies country, without having ſuffered any very ſignal blow, without any conſiderable miſtake committed upon his ſide, Fortune, who hath as it were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached herſelf to the defenſive, immediately forſook him. He was not able to take a ſingle place. And thoſe advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which at other times and ſituations, would have laid
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:1261701201:291"/>
the foundation of laſting empire, have in his caſe only protracted a ſevere deſtiny, which ſome think in the end inevitable; but which as many, as great, and as entire victories ſince obtained over his forces, have not been yet able to bring upon him.</p>
                        <p>The ballance of power, the pride of modern policy, and originally invented to preſerve the general peace as well as freedom of Europe, has openly preſerved its liberty. It has been the original of innumerable and fruitleſs wars. That political torture by which powers are to be enlarged or abridged, according to a ſtandard, perhaps not very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately imagined, ever has been, and it is to be feared will always continue a cauſe of infinite contention and bloodſhed. The foreign ambaſſadors conſtantly reſiding in all courts, the negotiations inceſſantly carrying on, ſpread both confederacies and quarrels ſo wide, that whenever hoſtilities commence, the theatre of war is always of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious extent. All parties in thoſe diffuſive operations, have of neceſſity their ſtrong and weak ſides. What they gain in one part is loſt in another; and in concluſion, their affairs become ſo ballanced, that all the powers concerned are certain to loſe a great deal; the moſt fortunate acquire little; and what they do acquire is never in any reaſonable proportion to charge and loſs.</p>
                        <p>Frequent experience of this might prove one of the ſtrongeſt grounds for a laſting peace in Europe. But that ſpirit of intrigue, which is the political diſtemper of the time, that anxious foreſight which forms the character of all the preſent courts, prevent the ſalutary effects which might reſult from this experience. Theſe modern treaties of peace, the fruits not of moderation but neceſſity; thoſe engagements contracted when all the parties are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and none ſatisfied, where none can properly be called conquerors or conquered, where after having ſought in vain to compel, they are content to over-reach them in the very moment they are formed, and from the very act of forming them, with the ſeeds of new diſſentions, more implacable animoſities, and more cruel wars. For if to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the work of peace, any member in theſe alliances ſhould acquire a ceſſion of any importance in its favour, this afterwards becomes a ground for another alliance, and for new intrigues to deprive them of their acquiſition. To ſettle the peace of Germany, Sileſia was yielded in 1745
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1261701201:292"/>
to the King of Pruſſia, and that ceſſion gave occaſion for the war of 1756.</p>
                        <p>The kings of Great Britain and Pruſſia choſe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſucceſs, to propoſe an accommodation; and they deſired that the oppoſite powers ſhould concur with them in nominating ſome place for a congreſs. Some ſpoke of Leipſic, as a means of indemnification to that unfortunate city; the States General would have given a town of theirs; King Staniſlaus offered Nancy, his capital: but the time of peace was not yet come. The two kings made a diſplay of moderation; and they had reaſon to think that if their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals ſhould be accepted (which probably they did not then expect) they muſt naturally take the lead in that negotiation, and muſt give the whole a turn to their advantage. But the adverſe alliance unanimouſly rejected their efforts, and the refuſal of ſome of its members was couched in terms ſufficiently haughty.</p>
                        <p>To ſpeak impartially, they could not at that time have accepted propoſitions for peace. France had ſuffered in every quarter: in her preſent condition ſhe could ſcarcely look for every favourable terms. As they had now aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in deſpair all attempts by ſea, and conſequently all efforts in North America and both the Indies, all their hopes were centered in Germany. Hitherto their fortune in that country had not been very encouraging. But ſtill, in that country lay their beſt and indeed their only proſpect. The ſtrength and perſeverance of the two empreſſes, the waſted condition of the King of Pruſſia, the enormous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the German war to England, which muſt gradually exhauſt the reſources of her credit, and with them the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of an inconſtant people, had inſpired with no ſmall hope. All theſe conſiderations confirmed their reſolution of hearkening to no terms, until by acquiring ſuperiority, or at leaſt an equality, they might be aſſured of procuring ſuch as were not very diſadvantageous or humiliating.</p>
                        <p>The empreſs queen upon her part had a moral certainty, that ſhe could not procure, by a treaty propoſed at ſuch a juncture, thoſe objects for which ſhe had begun, and with ſuch ſteadineſs in every fortune had carried on the war. In reality, her circumſtances then were, and they ſtill continue, very intricate and embarraſſed. It was neceſſary that ſhe ſhould have allies of great power; but if they have done her great ſervices, they have formed high pretenſions; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:1261701201:293"/>
ſo high, that if ſhe and her allies cannot abſolutely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the terms of peace, it is impoſſible that they ſhould all be in any degree ſatisfied.</p>
                        <p>Her ſituation in this reſpect has puſhed <hi>ad internecionem,</hi> the war between her and the King of Pruſſia. Even the ceſſion of all Sileſia in her favour, cannot procure a peace for that monarch. The Ruſſians will never let looſe their hold of the ducal Pruſſia; a country conquered by their own arms, a poſſeſſion which rendered the King moſt formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, and which is their ſole indemnification for what they have expended in a war entered into for other views than thoſe of glory, or even of revenge. It has been confidently aſſerted, that the empreſs queen of Hungary has actually guarantied the poſſeſſion of that country to its conquerors. This is indeed a very extraordinary ſtep, and the fact is not ſufficiently authenticated. But the report is not altogether improbable. We may be ſure that if ſuch a guarantee has been made, it has been entered into upon ſome reciprocal engagement of equal force, and for an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject equally important.</p>
                        <p>Nothing but the laſt deſperate neceſſity, nothing in ſhort but being conquered in the moſt abſolute ſenſe, will ever induce the King of Pruſſia to ſubmit to both theſe ceſſions. By ſuch a ſubmiſſion, beſide being deſpoiled of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, which is the great glory of his reign, and conſtitutes the firmeſt ſupport of his revenue, he will ſee his heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary dominions curtailed of another province from whence he derives his royal title, and what makes it of infinitely great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er importance in his eyes, the beſt commercial part of his territories, and that only part of his territories, by which he could have hoped to become in any degree a maritime power.</p>
                        <p>But though it were poſſible that his Pruſſian Majeſty could be brought to ſubmit to theſe humiliating terms, a great deal ſtill remains to be adjuſted. There are other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which though not ſo high in their nature, nor ſo ſtrongly enforced, are notwithſtanding conſiderable, and cannot, with any decency be totally neglected. What is the nature of the bargain between the Empreſs and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of Sweden, has not yet been made publick. Be it what it will, this is probably the leaſt perplexing part of the whole.</p>
                        <p>But ſome indemnification for the King of Poland, on
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1261701201:294"/>
whoſe dominions the greateſt calamities of the war have fallen, ſeems abſolutely neceſſary; and on what principle can Auſtria ever expect an ally, if ſhe ſhould ſecure all the benefits of the pacification to herſelf, and leave to her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates nothing but the ſufferings of a war in which they were involved purely in her quarrel?</p>
                        <p>This variety of demands, all to be ſatisfied out of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of a ſingle Prince, muſt neceſſarily perplex the work of peace with almoſt inſurmountable difficulties. It ought not indeed to be concealed, that there are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which ſeem to lead to ſome ſolution of this embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment. But if they are attentively concerned, they will, I believe, be rather found to increaſe it.</p>
                        <p>Great Britain has had remarkable ſucceſs againſt France at ſea, in America, and in the Indies. On the continent of Europe, her fortune is even at this day, tollerably ballanced: the two weak parts, therefore, in the oppoſite alliances, (I ſpeak only with regard to the events of the preſent war) are France and Pruſſia. As therefore France will expect ſome ceſſions from Great Britain, it is reaſonable that they ſhould be bought by ſome moderation of the rigorous terms which otherwiſe would have been impoſed on Pruſſia.</p>
                        <p>All the ſacrifices to peace muſt be made out of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage acquired by Auſtria and Great Britain. But when Great Britain ſhall have conſented to ſome conceſſions, to forward this great work, what return can the Empreſs Queen make, but an abatement of her demands upon Sile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia? That is, by giving up that grand, favourite, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to her ſole object, for which ſhe has brought upon herſelf a heavy war, diſguſted her antient and natural al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and purchaſed the aid of her natural enemy, at the price of places which the beſt blood of Europe has been ſo often ſhed to preſerve in her family. To all who conſider the character of that court, it will appear very plainly that ſhe will hazard almoſt any thing, and even riſque thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences to which her imprudent alliance with France has expoſed her, rather than accept a peace which muſt deprive her of her hopes of Sileſia.</p>
                        <p>When theſe things are weighed, it will not appear won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful that there have been ſo few ſerious overtures for peace; and that the longer the war continues, the greater difficulties ſeem to oppoſe themſelves to any concluſion of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="255" facs="tcp:1261701201:295"/>The only hope that remains of any happy concluſion, is that ſome of the great members of the alliance, wearied and exhauſted, will at length fly off, and thereby throw the reſt into ſuch confuſion, that a peace will be ſuddenly huddled up; and all difficulties not removed, but forgotten, by not allowing time to weigh and ſtudy what may be gained or loſt. This muſt produce a ſyſtem of pacification, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of which it is impoſſible to foreſee; becauſe it cannot be ſaid upon which ſide this defection will begin; but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally becauſe the war ſtill continues, in the event of which, in ſpight of all that can be conjectured from the ſtrength and preſent condition of the powers concerned, fortune will have ſo large a ſhare. But we may predict without raſhneſs, that the firſt overtures will be between Great Britain and France: for they never think of peace in Germany.</p>

                           <p>State of the Engliſh garriſon at Quebec. Deſigns of Monſ-Levi. Preparations for a ſiege. French army marches from Montreal. Their ſtrength. Battle of Sillery. Gen. Murray defeated. Quebec beſieged. The Engliſh fleet under Lord Colville arrives. French veſſels deſtroyed. Levi raiſes the ſiege.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THIS was the poſture of Europe at the cloſe of the campaign of 1759. And all thoughts of peace being entirely removed, the war was proſecuted in this part of the world with the utmoſt vigour as ſoon as the ſeaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to recommence operations.</p>
                        <p>But in America, the ſeverity of winter was not able whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to interrupt the progreſs of the war. Canada had been ſuppoſed conquered, by the taking of Quebec. Indeed without the poſſeſſion of that place, it had been impoſſible to reduce that country; but ſtill a great deal remained to compleat the advantage to which the taking of Quebec had only given an opening. The French troops after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, had retired into the heart of their country. And the Engliſh navy having provided the town ſufficiently with military ſtores and proviſions, ſet ſail, fearing leſt they ſhould be overtaken by the froſt. Ten battalions, two companies of the artillery, one of American wood-rangers, in all about 7000 men, formed the garriſon which was left
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:1261701201:296"/>
in Quebec to command Canada during the winter, and to facilitate the entire reduction of that province in the enſuing campaign. They were under the orders of General Murray.</p>
                        <p>As the river St. Laurence is commonly ſhut up by ice, for the greater part of the winter, all communication with Europe was cut off. The conquering army was therefore ſubject to be inveſted in Quebec. The French command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, M. Levi, was ſenſible of this advantage; and he ſaw that it was the only reſource by which he could have any chance of preſerving Canada. He accordingly prepared to make uſe of this laſt, and only opportunity; and he was not without ſome proſpect of ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>He knew that the fortifications of Quebec were weak and incomplete, without any kind of outwork; that the town was almoſt a general ruin, ſince the late ſiege; and that the Engliſh garriſon had been much enfeebled, and greatly reduced in their numbers by the ſcurvy. He knew alſo, that by ſome misfortune, no proviſion had been made to prevent his attaining a ſuperiority on the river; as no veſſels had been left, on a ſuppoſition, that they could not be uſeful in winter.</p>
                        <p>The winter had paſſed in ſkirmiſhes always terminating in favour of the Engliſh, by which they enlarged the ſphere of their ſubſiſtence. M. Levi had indeed propoſed, during the rigour of the ſeaſon, to attempt the place by a coup de main; and had made preparations for that purpoſe. But the activity of the garriſon was ſuch; and all the outpoſts ſo well ſecured, that he thought it more prudent to abandon that deſign, and to poſtpone his operations, to the opening of the ſpring, when a regular ſiege might be formed.</p>
                        <p>The forces which ſtill remained in Canada, were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal to the attempt. Ten battalions of regular troops, amounting to near 5000 men; 6000 of experienced militia of Canada; about 300 ſavages. This was the force which M. Levi had collected at Montreal, and with which he took the field on the 17th of April, 1760.</p>
                        <p>His proviſions, ammunition, and heavy baggage, fell down the river St. Laurence, under the convoy of ſix fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates from 44 to 26 guns. By this ſquadron, which there was nothing to oppoſe, he acquired the undiſputed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the river, a point of the greateſt importance to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:1261701201:297"/>
the whole deſign. In ten days march, the French army arrived at the heights of Abraham three miles from Quebec.</p>
                        <p>When Gen. Murray perceived the approach of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he had two parts to take, either to keep within the town, and confiding in his troops, which though weak as an army, were ſtrong as a garriſon, to ſuſtain the ſiege to the utmoſt extremity; or to march out, and by trying the fortune of the field, to avoid the tedious hardſhips of a ſiege, in a place which ſeemed to him ſcarcely tenable.</p>
                        <p>He reſolved on the latter part. But when he came to review his ability for this undertaking, he could poſſibly draw into the field no more than 3000 men. However he was not frighted by the enemy's great ſuperiority. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to engage; and he grounded his reſolution on the following reaſons.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, that his army, notwithſtanding its inferiority, was in the habit of beating the enemy. That they had a fine train of field artillery; that to ſhut themſelves up at once within the walls, was putting all upon the ſingle chance of holding out for a conſiderable time a wretched fortification; a chance which an action in the field could hardly alter, at the ſame time that it gave an additional one, and perhaps a better; and in fine, that if the event was not proſperous, he might, after holding out to the laſt extremity, retreat, with what ſhould remain of the garriſon, to the iſle of Orleans or Coudres, and there wait for reinforcements.</p>
                        <p>It is not eaſy to comprehend the prudence of engaging in the open field, an army four times ſuperior; eſpecially when the weaker army had it in their power to keep upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive in a ſtrong poſt; and Quebec may well be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at leaſt as a ſtrong retrenchment. It is as hard to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how the chance of holding out a fortreſs, ſhould not be leſſened after a defeat of the troops, which compoſe the garriſon, who muſt neceſſarily ſuffer by ſuch an event, both in numbers and in ſpirit; it is equally difficult to conceive how the remains of that garriſon, which ſhould be driven from Quebec, could have ſafely retreated to the iſle of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans or Coudreſs, or have remained in either of thoſe places, with any tolerable ſecurity, whilſt the enemy were, as they were, confeſſedly maſters of the river. Theſe are matters not ſo eaſily comprehended by thoſe who are at a diſtance from the ſcene of action; there circumſtances may have given theſe reaſons their due weight; and they had the

greater influence from the character of the general; a man of the moſt ardent and intripid courage, paſſionately deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of glory, and emulous of the reputation Wolfe had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. He knew that a bold and ſucceſsful ſtroke, and well purſued, might ſo diſable the enemy, who were in no likelihood of receiving ſpeedy or conſiderable ſuccours from France, that the way to conqueſt would lie plain and open before him; and he might expect the honour of the total reduction of Canada, before the arrival of the reſt of the king's forces to his aſſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>Thus depending on fortune, on the tried goodneſs of his troops, and his own courage to animate them, he marched out of the city, and deſcended from the heights of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham with the army mentioned above, and twenty field-pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The right and left of the enemy's van poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of ſome ſmall woody eminences; the main army marched by the road of St. Foix; and formed themſelves under the ſhelter of the woods. Whilſt the body of the enemies army was yet unformed, the Engliſh troops attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their van, both on the right and left, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impetuoſity, and drove them from the eminences, though they were well maintained; the advanced poſts of the French centre gave way, without a blow, and fell back upon their main army.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto the fortune of the field was favourable to the Engliſh; but now the advantages they had obtained brought them full on the main army of the French, which formed in columns, and advanced with great rapidity to ſupport their broken vanguard. The fire became very hot, and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the progreſs of our troops; whilſt thoſe of the enemy having ſupported their centre, wheeled round the flanks of the Britiſh army to the left and right, and formed a ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle, which threatened to cloſe upon our rear. Proper movements were made to protect the flanks, but it was evident the army was in the greateſt danger, not only of a defeat, but of ſeeing itſelf ſurrounded, and its retreat to Quebec intirely intercepted. Near one thouſand men, ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and officers, (a third of the army) had been, by this time killed and wounded. Nothing could be now thought of but as ſpeedy a retreat as poſſible; and in this there were difficulties, which nothing but the bravery of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery and the ſkill and ſpirit of the officers could overcome. They gained Quebec with little loſs in the purſuit; but
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:1261701201:301"/>
they were obliged to leave their cannon, which they could not bring off, on account of the wreaths of ſnow, which even in this advanced ſeaſon, and in the temperate latitude of 47, ſtill lay upon the ground. The French loſt at leaſt 2000 in the action.</p>
                        <p>When the account of this victory arrived in Europe, the French were for a while infinitely elated. The blow was ſenſibly felt in England. Our ſanguine hopes were at once ſunk. If Quebec was loſt, it was evident that the greateſt difficulties muſt have ariſen to our affairs in America, and the reduction of Canada muſt become the work of more than one campaign. Nobody imagined that the town could hold out longer after ſuch a defeat; and the fleet ſent from Europe to reinforce the place was then at a great diſtance.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs all things were prepared at Quebec for a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous defence. The late check he had received, only rouſed the governor to more ſtrenuous efforts. He knew that the loſs of the place would be attributed to the teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his councils; he was ſenſible that in proportion to the honours paid by the public to thoſe who had conquered Quebec, would their indignation fall upon thoſe by whom it ſhould happen to be loſt; and that in general nothing makes a worſe figure, than a raſhneſs which is not fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Theſe thoughts were perpetual ſtings to a mind like his, paſſionately deſirous of glory; and that very diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which led him to fight unſucceſsfully with a weak army, gave him activity and ſucceſs in the defence of a weak forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                        <p>The French, whoſe whole hope of ſucceſs depended on perfecting their work before a Britiſh ſquadron could ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, loſt not a moment's time to improve their victory. They opened trenches before the town the very night of the battle. But it was the 11th of May before they could bring two batteries to play upon the fortifications. They were greatly deficient in this reſpect. Their accounts ſay, they had no more than twelve pieces of iron artillery, which carried twelve pound balls. The Engliſh train, was without compariſon, ſuperior. Before the French had opened their batteries, 132 pieces of cannon were placed on the ramparts. The fire of the beſiegers was therefore always ſlack, interrupted, and of little effect.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding the weakneſs of the enemies fire, the ſuperiority of the Engliſh artillery, and the reſolution of the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1261701201:302"/>
governor, and garriſon, the relief of the place depended en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on the early arrival of the Britiſh fleet, which was looked out for every hour with the moſt anxious expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Had any French ſhips of force come before the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, it was the general opinion that the place muſt inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably have fallen into their hands.</p>
                        <p>On the 9th of May to the great joy of the garriſon, an Engliſh frigate anchored in the baſon and brought them an account that the Britiſh ſquadron commanded by Lord Colville, was then in the river. On the 16th, a ſhip of the line and a frigate arrived; the next morning the two frigates were ſent to attack the French ſquadron above the town. They executed their commiſſion ſo well, that in a moment all the French veſſels of whatever kind were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, and the greateſt part deſtroyed or taken.</p>
                        <p>M. Levi, who had the mortification to behold from the eminences this action, which at one ſtroke put an end to all the hopes he had conceived from the late victory, was perſuaded that theſe frigates by the boldneſs of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, muſt have been the vanguard of a conſiderable rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement; and that too cloſe at hand: He therefore raiſed the ſiege in the utmoſt hurry and precepitation, leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind all his artillery, and a great part of his ammunition and baggage, although Lord Colville, with the reſt of the ſquadron, did not arrive at Quebec untill two days after.<hi rend="sup">(a)</hi>

                                 <p>HAVING acquainted General <hi>Amberſt,</hi> three weeks ago, that <hi>Quebec</hi> was beſieged, by an army of 15,000 men, I think it neceſſary, to do myſelf the honour of addreſſing directly to you, the more agreeable news of the ſiege being raiſed, leſt, by your receiving the former intelligence, before the latter, ſome incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience might ariſe to his Majeſty's ſervice.</p>
                                 <p>By the journal of my proceedings, ſince I have had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand here, which I have the honour to tranſmit to you, you will perceive the ſuperiority we have maintained over the enemy, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the winter, and that all Lower <hi>Canada,</hi> from the Point <hi>Au-Tremble,</hi> was reduced, and had taken the oath of fidelity to the 
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:1261701201:303"/>
King. You will, no doubt, be pleaſed to obſerve, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's attempts upon our poſts, and ours upon theirs, all tended to the honour of his Majeſty's arms, they were always baffled, and we were conſtantly lucky.</p>
                                 <p>I wiſh I could ſay as much within the walls; the exceſſive cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the climate, and conſtant living upon ſalt proviſions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any vegetables, introduced the ſcurvy among the troops, which, getting the better of every precaution of the officer, and every remedy of the ſurgeon, became as univerſal as it was invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, inſomuch, that, before the end of April, 1000 were dead, and above 2000 of what remained, totally unſit for ſervice.</p>
                                 <p>In this ſituation, I received certain intelligence, that the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier <hi>de Levis</hi> was aſſembling his army, which had been cantoned in the neighbourhood of <hi>Montreal;</hi> that he had compleated his eight battallions, and forty companies of the Troops de Colonie, from the choice of the <hi>Montrealiſts;</hi> had formed theſe forty companies into four battalions; and was determinad to beſiege us, the moment that St. Laurence was open, of which he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely maſter, by means of four King's frigates, and other craft, proper for this extraordinary river.</p>
                                 <p>As I had the honour to acquaint you formerly, that <hi>Quebec</hi> could be looked upon in no other light, than that of a ſtrong can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonment, and that any works I ſhould add to it, would be in that ſtile, my plan of defence was, to take the earlieſt opportunity of entrenching myſelf upon the heights of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which entirely commanded the ramparts of the place at the diſtance of 800 yards, and might have been defended by our numbers againſt a large army. But the Chevalier <hi>de Levis</hi> did not give me time to take the advantage of this ſituation; the 23d, 24th and 25th of <hi>April.</hi> I attempted to execute the projected lines, for which a proviſion of faſcines, and of every neceſſary material, had been made, but found it impracticable, as the earth was ſtill cover'd with ſnow in many places, and every where impregnably bound up by the froſt.</p>
                                 <p>The night of the 26th, I was informed, the enemy had land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at Point <hi>Au Tremble,</hi> 10,000 men, and 500 barbarians. The poſt we had taken at the embouchure of the river <hi>Caprouge</hi> (the moſt convenient place for diſembarking their artillery and ſtores, and for ſecuring their retreat) obliged them to land where they did, 20 miles higher up.</p>
                                 <pb n="262" facs="tcp:1261701201:304"/>
                                 <p>The 27th, having broke down all the bridges over the <hi>Caprouge,</hi> and ſecured the landing places at <hi>Sillery,</hi> and the <hi>Foulon,</hi> I march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the grenadiers piquets, <hi>Amherſt</hi>'s regiment, and two field pieces, and took poſt ſo advantageouſly, as to fruſtrate the ſchemes they had laid of cutting off our poſts. They had begun to form from the defile they were obliged to paſs, but thought proper to retreat, on reconnoitring our poſition; and about four this afternoon we marched back to town, having withdrawn all our poſts, with the loſs of two men only, though they did every thing in their power to harraſs the rear.</p>
                                 <p>The enemy was greatly ſuperior in number, it is true; but when I conſidered that our little army was in the habit of beating that enemy, and had a very fine train of field artillery; that ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ourſelves up at once within the walls, was putting all upon the ſingle chance of holding out for a conſiderable time, a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fortification; a chance which an action in the field could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alter, at the ſame time it gave an additional one, perhaps a better, I reſolved to give them battle; and if the event was not proſperous, to hold out to the laſt extremity, and then to retreat to the iſle of Orleans, or Coudres, with what was left of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, to wait for reinforcements.</p>
                                 <p>This night the neceſſary orders were given, and half an hour after ſix next morning, we marched with all the force I could muſter, viz. three thouſand men, and formed the Army on the heights, in the following order; <hi>Amherſt</hi>'s <hi>Anſtruther</hi>'s 2d bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion of <hi>Royal Americans,</hi> and <hi>Webb</hi>'s, compoſed the right Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade, commanded by Col. <hi>Burton: Kenneny's Laſcelles's, High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> and <hi>Townſhend</hi>'s, the left brigade, commanded by Col. <hi>Fraſer: Otway</hi>'s, and the third battalion of <hi>Royal Americans,</hi> were the corps de reſerve. Major <hi>Dalling</hi>'s corps of light infantry co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the right flank, and Capt. <hi>Hazzen</hi>'s company of rangers, with 100 volunteers, under the command of Capt. Donoald Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donald, a brave and experienced officer, cover'd the left. The battalions had each two field pieces.</p>
                                 <p>While the line was forming, I reconnitred the enemy, and perceived their van had taken poſſeſſion of the riſing grounds, three quarters of a mile in our front, but that their army was upon the march, in one column, as far as I could ſee. I thought this the lucky moment, and moved with the utmoſt order to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack them, before they had formed. We ſoon beat them from the 
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:1261701201:305"/>
heights they had poſſeſſed, tho' they were well diſputed; and Major <hi>Dalling,</hi> who cannot be too much commended for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour this day, and his ſervices during the winter, forced their corps of grenadiers from a houſe and windmill they had taken hold of, to cover their left flank. Here he, and ſeveral of his officers were wounded; his men, however, purſued the fugitives to the corps which were now formed to ſuſtain them. They halted, and diſperſed along the front of the right, which prevented that wing from taking advantage of the firſt impreſſion they had made on the enemy's left. They had immediately orders given them to regain the flank, but, in attempting this, they were charged, thrown into diſorder, retired to the rear, and from the number of officers killed and wounded, could never again be brought up, during the action. <hi>Otway</hi>'s was inſtantly ordered to advance, and ſuſtain the right wing, which the enemy in vain made two at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to penetrate. On theſe occaſions, Capt. <hi>Ince,</hi> with the grenadiers of <hi>Otway</hi>'s, were diſtinguiſhed. While this paſſed there, the left were not idle; they had diſpoſſeſſed the enemy of two redoubts, and ſuſtained with unparallelled firmneſs the bold united efforts of the enemy's regulars. <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Canadians,</hi> till at laſt fairly fought down, and reduced to a handful; though ſuſtained by the 3d battalion of <hi>Royal Americans</hi> from the reſerve, and <hi>Kennedy</hi>'s from the centre, where we had nothing to fear, they were obliged to yield to ſuperior numbers, and a freſh column of <hi>Rouſſillon,</hi> which penetrated.</p>
                                 <p>The diſorder of the left was ſoon communicated to the right; but the whole retired in ſuch a way, that the enemy did not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon a briſk purſuit. We left moſt of our cannon, as the roughneſs of the ground, and the wreaths of ſnow, made it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to bring them off; what could not be brought off were nailed up.</p>
                                 <p>Our killed and wounded amounted to one third of thoſe in the field; that of the enemy, by their own confeſſion, exceeds 2500 men; which may be readily conceived, as the action laſted an hour and three quarters.</p>
                                 <p>Here I think it my duty to expreſs my gratitude to the officers in general, and the ſatisfaction I had in the bravery of all the troops.</p>
                                 <p>On the night of the 28th, the enemy opened trenches againſt the town; and, at the ſame, we ſet to work within, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify 
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1261701201:306"/>
it, which we never had in our power to attempt ſooner, from the ſeverity of this climate during the winter, and the abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of executing works of more immediate importance laſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, before the froſt ſet in. I wanted the aſſiſtance of Major <hi>Mackeller,</hi> the chief engineer, dangerouſly wounded in the action; his zeal for, and knowledge in the ſervice, is well known; but the alacrity of the garriſon made up for every defect.</p>
                                 <p>My journal of the ſiege which accompanies this, ſets forth in full what was done; and I flatter myſelf, the extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the handful of brave men I had left, will pleaſe his Majeſty, as much as they ſurprized us who were eye witneſſes to them.</p>
                                 <p>Great praiſe is due to Commodore <hi>Swanton,</hi> and the Captains <hi>Schomberg</hi> and <hi>Dean;</hi> I have not words to expreſs the readineſs, vivacity, and valour they ſhewed in attacking and deſtroying the enemy's ſquadron. Capt. <hi>Dean</hi> has loſt his ſhip; but it was in a good cauſe, and he has done honour to his country.</p>
                                 <p>The morning of the 27th of <hi>May,</hi> I had intended a ſtrong for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to have penetrated into the enemy's camp, which, from the information of the priſoners I had taken, and the concurrent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the deſerters, I conceived to be very practicable.</p>
                                 <p>For this purpoſe, I had ordered the regiments of <hi>Amherſt, Townſhend, Laſcelles, Anſtruther,</hi> and <hi>Highlanders,</hi> with the grenadiers and light infantry under arms, but was informed by Lieut. <hi>M'Alpin,</hi> of my battalion (whom I ſent out to amuſe the enemy with ſmall allies) that their trenches were abandoned.</p>
                                 <p>I inſtantly puſhed out at the head of theſe corps, not doubting but we muſt have overtaken and forced their rear, and had ample revenge for the 28th of <hi>April;</hi> but I was diſappointed, for they had croſſed the river <hi>Caprouge,</hi> before we could come up with them. However, we took ſeveral priſoners, and much baggage, which would otherwiſe have eſcaped. They left their camp ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; all their baggage, ſtores, magazines of proviſions and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, 34 pieces of battering cannon, four of which are bra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At preſent they do not exceed

5000 men. The minute I am joined with that part of my garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which was ſent from hence laſt autumn, I ſhall endeavour to co-operate with Mr. <hi>Amherſt,</hi> towards compleating the reduction of this country; though, if rightly informed, he can hardly act by the lakes before the month of <hi>July,</hi> of which I am the more convinced, becauſe from the intelligence forwarded to him laſt <hi>February,</hi> of the enemy's deſigns, by Lieut. <hi>Montuſor,</hi> he would certainly have been upon them before now, had it been at all practicable.</p>
                                 <p>Major <hi>Maitland,</hi> the bearer of theſe diſpatches, who has acted as Adjutant General this laſt winter, is well acquainted with all our tranſactions here; he has a thorough knowledge of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and can give you the beſt lights with regard to the meaſures farther to be taken, relative to his Majeſty's views in <hi>Canada.</hi>

Governor, Col. <hi>Burton;</hi> his activity and zeal were conſpicuous during the whole courſe of this winter's campaign, and I flatter myſelf, Sir, you will be pleaſed to lay his ſervices before his Majeſty.</p>

from <hi>England;</hi> but having on the 14th, received advice from Brig.

                                 <p>The night following, the enemy raiſed the ſiege of <hi>Quebec</hi> very precipitately, leaving their cannon, ſmall arms, ſtores, &amp;c. behind them.</p>
                                 <p>The <hi>Leoſtoffe</hi> run upon ſome unknown rocks, in purſuit of the enemy, and was irrecoverably loſt, but the officers and men were ſaved.</p>

                           <p>Diſtreſs of Saxony. M. Broglio commands the main body of the French army. St. Germain commands on the Rhine. Engliſh army reinforced. King of Pruſſia's loſſes.

                        </argument>
                        <p>A Winter remarkably ſevere ſucceeded the bloody cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign of 1758. At Bareith in the night of the 16th of December, the cold was inſupportable. Reamur's
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:1261701201:309"/>
therometer was ſunk to 15, which is preciſely the ſame degree it fell to in 1709. A year like this diſtinguiſhed by the intenſeneſs of the cold, and the fury of war. Birds dropped dead in their flight. At Leipſic ten centinels were froze to death. An infectious diſeaſe which began in the armies, diffuſed itſelf among the inhabitants of Saxony, and made a dreadful havock. A peſtilential contagion ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged among the cattle. Famine was ſoon added to the reſt of their calamities; and every miſery that can afflict man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, was poured out upon that unfortunate people with the moſt liberal meaſure. There was no proſpect of an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation of theſe diſtreſſes. On the contrary, the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the people only made their ſovereigns more earneſt for revenge; and out of the general want a reſource aroſe to their armies, who were the more readily recruited, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſcanty pay and ſubſiſtence of a ſoldier, became an object of envy to the wretched peaſantry in moſt of theſe countries; and death ſeemed more honourable and leſs certain by the ſword, than by penury and diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>France and England vied in their endeavours to augment their forces in Germany. M. Broglio had now the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the grand army, and the ſole conduct of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral plan of operations. He had early in this year, been honoured with the ſtaff of a marſhal of France. And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was omitted to give luſtre to his command, and to furniſh him with every means of exerting his talents. His corps was augmented to near 100,000 effective men. Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand drawn out of their quarters in Duſſeldorp, Cleves, Cologne and Weſel, and compleated by draughts from France, formed a ſeperate army on the Rhine, under the Count de St. Germain. This diſpoſition was made not only to divide the attention of the allied army, but to prevent the ill conſequences of the miſunderſtanding which was known to ſubſiſt between this general and the Duke de Broglio. The third army propoſed at the cloſe of the foregoing campain did not appear.</p>
                        <p>On the ſide of England, the preparations were not leſs conſiderable in proportion to her ability for that kind of war. Six regiments of foot commanded by Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Griffin, were forthwith ſent to reinforce the allied ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Elliot's regiment of light horſe ſoon followed them. At the opening of this campaign, we had in Germany twelve regiments of heavy, and one of light horſe; and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:1261701201:310"/>
twelve regiments, with two Highland battalions of foot; the whole amounted to near 22,000 men. In the courſe of the ſummer, they were further reinforced to near 25,000, Such a number of Britiſh troops, ſerving in one army, had not been ſeen on the continent, for two hundred years paſt. The allied army indeed fell ſhort of the French in numbers; but they exceeded it in the quality of the troops. Thoſe newly arrived from England were freſh but not undiſciplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the old were indeed harraſſed, but they had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to victory.</p>
                        <p>In the beginning of the year, the death of the Landgrave of Heſſe Caſſel had excited ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Jan. 31."/> 

 the diſpoſitions of the ſucceſſor were uncertain; and his withdrawing himſelf from the cauſe of the allies would have made a breach in their army, that it would have proved almoſt impoſſible to ſtop. But theſe fears were ſoon diſſipated. The new Landgrave among the very firſt acts of his government, gave the ſtrongeſt proofs of his ſteady adherence to the ſyſtem of his father, and even agreed to add conſiderably to the Heſſian troops in the pay of Great Britain; ſo that all things promiſed as favourably to the allies, as from that irremediable inferiority in numbers could have been expected.</p>
                        <p>The king of Pruſſia was under far greater difficulties; he had felt the heavieſt blows, and was moſt ſcanted in the means of healing them.</p>
                        <p>His loſſes were not to be reckoned by the men killed and priſoners, but by armies deſtroyed or taken. Forty gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals had died, or were ſlain in his ſervice, ſince the 1ſt of October 1756, excluſive of thoſe who had been wounded, diſabled, or made priſoners. And this alone would have been a loſs not to be repaired, if theſe murdering wars which cut off ſo many experienced officers, did not at the ſame time, form ſo many more to ſupply their places. The king had renewed his alliance on the former terms with Great Britain. By his indefatigable induſtry, no gaps were ſeen in his armies. But they were no longer the ſame troops, and if the king of Pruſſia had formerly the merit of ably commanding the moſt excellent armies; he has now to fill up the moſt remarkable deficiency on the part of his troops by his own heroiſm; and to undertake far more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous enterprizes, than his firſt, with infinitely weaker in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. His affairs wore a bad aſpect in the opening of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:1261701201:311"/>
the former year. In this they ſeemed altogether deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
                        <p>The Ruſſians had ſuffered; but they were ſufficiently reinforced. The Swedes who had been generally obliged to give ground in the winter, had in that of 1759 the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in ſeveral ſmart ſkirmiſhes, and had even taken priſoner the Pruſſian general Manteuffel. As to the Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trians, victorious for a whole campaign almoſt without fighting, their armies and magazines were full, their corps compleat, their men freſh, vigorous, and full of reſolution. Several ſkirmiſhes of conſequence had been fought during the ceſſation of the great operations; and they were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to their advantage.</p>
                        <p>The King of Pruſſia was ſenſible, that in this, as in the former campaigns, he ſhould be attacked by four armies; and that his dominions would be inveſted upon every ſide. As theſe operations were very extenſive and complicated, to enable the reader to form an idea of the campaign, it will not be amiſs to ſay ſomething of the ground the king had to defend, which is circumſtanced in this manner.</p>
                        <p>To the north is Pomerania. This country is very open; and it is defended on that part on which the Swedes gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally act, with but few, and thoſe mean fortifications, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clam, Demmein and Paſſewalk. But then the Swediſh army is not numerous, and if they ſhould attempt to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate far into the country, they muſt leave Stetin, in which there is always a ſtrong garriſon behind them to their left, which would render their ſubſiſtence difficult, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in caſe of any misfortune, extremely hazardous; and they have not ſufficient ſtrength to maſter this place by a regular ſiege. This has always proved a check to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of that army, even when they have been otherwiſe ſucceſsful.</p>
                        <p>This ſame country to the eaſtward of the Oder, is one great object of the Ruſſian deſigns. Its chief ſtrength in this quarter is the town of Colberg; a place they have frequently attempted, but always without ſucceſs. And their failure, in this inſtance, has been the main cauſe why they have never been able to take winter quarters in the King of Pruſſia's dominions, or even during the campaign, to make any conſiderable impreſſion upon Pomerania. For they can have no communication with their own country by ſea, for want of this port. On their rear, lies the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:1261701201:312"/>
and inhoſpitable deſert of Waldow; and this with the uncertain diſpoſition of the city of Dantzick, renders their ſupplies of proviſion from Poland difficult and precarious. Neither is it poſſible in theſe circumſtances, to unite their forces with thoſe of Sweden acting in the ſame country. The Oder flows between them; which is ſo commanded by the city of Stetin, as to make all communication between theſe armies in a great meaſure impracticable. Inſomuch, that on the ſide of Pomerania, the force of theſe two pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is compelled to act ſeparately, without concert, and therefore weakly and ineffectually.</p>
                        <p>To the weſtward, the King of Pruſſia is ſufficiently co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the city of Magdebourg, the ſtrongeſt place in his dominions, and in that part of Germany. Here are his greateſt magazines, and his principal founderies; and this is the repoſitory of whatever he finds neceſſary to place out of the reach of ſudden inſult.</p>
                        <p>To the ſouthward he is obliged to defend Saxony and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſia. Both of theſe countries on their frontiers towards Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia, riſe into very rough, broken, and mountainous grounds, abounding in advantageous poſts and ſtrong ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Luſatia lies between them; a level ſandy plain, (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſed with pine-woods,) extending without any obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to the very gates of Berlin. Through this country the king's communication between Sileſia and Saxony muſt be kept up, and therefore it has been from the beginning of this war, the great ſcene of thoſe remarkable marches and counter-marches, by which his Pruſſian majeſty has acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo great a reputation; and alſo of thoſe bold and ſudden attempts which have diſtinguiſhed ſome of the generals of the adverſe party. As an army cannot be advantageouſly poſted in this territory, it has not been uſual for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably body to remain there long; and it is particularly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable to defenſive operations. This country may be conſidered as the curtin, and the frontiers of Saxony and Sileſia as the baſtions, that flank the ſort of fortification, which the king is to maintain.</p>
                        <p>No part of that monarch's territories are naturally more defenceleſs than the eaſtern; at the ſame time that it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by the moſt powerful of his enemies. A country al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſandy and level, extends along both ſides of the Oder, from the northern frontier of Sileſia, until it meets Pomerania, a country of the ſame kind. There is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:1261701201:313"/>
fortification on this ſide; and the river Warta that falls here into the Oder, makes the tranſport of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and conſequently the ſubſiſtence of the armies that act againſt him more eaſy.</p>
                        <p>As to Sileſia, it is covered on the Bohemian ſide with mountains, and it contains places of ſuch ſtrength as to be above the neceſſity of yielding to the firſt army that appears before them. Indeed it is to be remarked, that ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſtrength ſeems ſufficient for the kind of ſervice which has diſtinguiſhed this war. Never was a war of ſuch a length and extent, in which fewer ſieges of conſequence have been formed; and the late ſervice which affords ſo large a field for experience in every other ſpecies of military operations, affords very little matter of improvement in the art of reducing or defending ſtrong places.</p>
                        <p>The King of Pruſſia's deſign ſeems to have been to ſave himſelf as much as poſſible to the end of the campaign; the only time when his ſucceſs might be deciſive, and his ill-fortune not ruinous. He therefore formed a defenſive plan. In purſuance of this he withdrew his out-poſts from Freyberg, and drawing a chain of cantonments from the foreſt of Tharandt on his right to the Elbe, he took a moſt advantageous camp between that river and the Multa; ſtrongly intrenching it where it had not been previouſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by nature; and furniſhed it with ſo numerous an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, that they reckoned in their front only 250 pieces of cannon.</p>
                        <p>In this ſituation he covered the moſt material parts of Saxony, kept the attention of M. Daun's army engaged, and was enabled to ſend out reinforcements to Prince Henry, or elſewhere, as occaſion ſhould require, without expoſing one part whilſt he defended the other.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt the King's army defended his conqueſts in Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Prince Henry had aſſembled an army about Franckfort on the Oder, and took various poſitions about that place and Croſſen. In this poſition, he commanded three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal communications, in ſuch a manner as to protect at once Sileſia, the New Marche of Brandenburg, and the avenues to Berlin; all which were threatened by ſeveral bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the enemy. General Fouquet had eſtabliſhed his quarters near the county of Glatz, and whilſt he covered that ſide of Sileſia, he communicated with Prince Henry, and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:1261701201:314"/>
was ſo diſpoſed as to ſend to or receive ſuccours from him, as either party ſhould happen to be preſſed.</p>
                        <p>M. Daun, as ſoon as he ſaw that the King of Pruſſia had fortified himſelf in his poſt, he too buried himſelf in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, and kept the moſt attentive eye upon all hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>At length he declared himſelf. Having by ſeveral fein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> perſuaded general Fouquet that his intentions were againſt Schweidnitz, that general marched thither a conſiderable body of his troops, and left Glatz uncovered. As ſoon as Laudohn perceived this movement, he on his ſide made another, and poſſeſſed himſelf of Landſhut; and when he had taken Landſhut, he pretended a deſign of ſecuring this poſt by leaving a ſmall body of troops there. This feint alſo ſucceeded, and drew general Fouquet from Schweid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitz back again to Landſhut. He drove the Auſtrians from that place without difficulty; but in the mean time Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dohn made himſelf maſter of ſeveral important paſſes, by which he was in ſome ſort enabled to ſurround the corps of General Fouquet.</p>
                        <p>The commander finding himſelf in thoſe dangerous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, had nothing left but to fortify his poſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made a very ſtrong one, with additional works; which he did with ſuch effect, that it had more the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a regular fortification than an entrenchment. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the army he commanded was far from numerous; and he was obliged to weaken it ſtill farther by a detachment of 2000 men, to preſerve, if poſſible, a communication with Schweidnitz.</p>
                        <p>Laudohn longed to diſtinguiſh himſelf by ſome capital ſtroke; he had now by a ſeries of very artful movements procured a moſt favourable opportunity. Firſt, therefore, he ſhut up with great dexterity the paſſes on every ſide, and
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:1261701201:315"/>
rendered his adverſary's retreat impracticable. Then he began an attack on the Pruſſian entrenchments in the dead of the night in three different places.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 23."/> 

 The ſignal for the aſſault was given by four hawbitzers fired in the air. The Auſtrians ruſhed to the attack with uncommon fury, and maintained it with ſo ſteady a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that in three quarters of an hour the two ſtrongeſt entrenchments were carried, and the line of communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on forced: The Pruſſians at day-break found themſelves puſhed back from hill to hill, and line to line, to their laſt entrenchments. Their reſiſtance was all along brave, and their retreat regular. The enemy purchaſed every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage at the deareſt rate; but at laſt preſſed upon every ſide, worn down by a terrible ſlaughter, their general diſabled by two mortal wounds, at eight in the morning the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the army threw down their arms and ſurrendered on the field of battle.</p>
                        <p>On the ſide of the vanquiſhed, the ſlain were about 4000. The priſoners were, one general of foot, namely general Fouquet; two major generals; two hundred and thirteen officers of the inferior rank; and upwards of 7000 private ſoldiers, 58 pieces of artillery, with a number of colours. Never was a more entire and deciſive victory. The whole army, general, officers, every thing was deſtroyed. Scarce three hundred of the body intrenched by Landſhut eſcaped. The corps alone which was to preſerve the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, together with ſome bodies of cavalry who had not been engaged, with difficulty got into Schweidnitz, where they expected every moment to be beſieged. This advantage coſt the Auſtrians above 12000 men killed and wounded.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THIS victory was purſued with as much rapidity as it was obtained with courage and addreſs. Baron Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dohn immediately returned back from Landſhut, fell
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:1261701201:316"/>
like a ſtorm upon Glatz. Glatz conſiſts of two fortreſſes, the old and the new. The old was taken by ſtorm; the new ſurrendered at diſcretion. Two thouſand brave men and ſome good works could not defend it againſt the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity of the Auſtrians. One hundred and one pieces of braſs cannon were taken. Immenſe magazines of proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and military ſtores piled up in this frontier place to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in better times an irruption into Bohemia, fell into the hands of the conqueror. Every thing gave way. The poſſeſſion of Glatz laid all Sileſia open, and the Auſtrians might turn their arms upon any ſide without the leaſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the freedom of their retreat. Neither was there any ſort of army to give the leaſt obſtruction. The King of Pruſſia held down by M. Daun, was in Saxony. Prince Henry was alſo at a great diſtance towards Cuſtrin. If that Prince attempted to move to the relief of Sileſia, he laid open Brandenburgh, and even Berlin itſelf to the irruptions of the Ruſſians. If he remained in his poſt, Sileſia was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably loſt. Even his ſpeedieſt march ſeemed by no means a certain way to releive it. The King was yet further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; and any motion of his threatened to ſhake and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinge the whole ſcheme of his defence; expoſing at once Saxony and Berlin. The loſs of his third army, ſmall as that army was, laid him under difficulties that ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable.</p>
                        <p>Favoured by theſe circumſtances, Laudohn had only to chuſe what direction he ſhould give his arms. Sileſia, as has been obſerved, lay open before him. He had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened Schweidnitz; but he ſaw that Breſlaw was a place of greater conſequence, much more eaſily reduced, and that the poſſeſſion of it facilitated a junction with the Ruſſians; a point on which the ultimate improvement of his victory wholly depended. The place beſides is of ſo great extent, and the works of ſo little comparative ſtrength, that he had no ſmall hopes of maſtering it before Prince Henry could come, if he ſhould at all attempt to come to its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
                        <p>He therefore delayed no longer than the march of his heavy artillery and the neceſſary preparatives required, to lay ſiege to the capital of Sileſia, of whoſe ſafety the moſt ſanguine friends of his Pruſſian majeſty began to diſpair,</p>
                        <p>But in the interval between the battle of Landſhut and the commencement of the ſiege of Breſlau, the King of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:1261701201:317"/>
Pruſſia was not idle. His thoughts were continually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to repair this diſaſter; all ordinary reſources were impracticable or ineffectual. His genius alone could enter the liſts with his ill fortune. Placing therefore his hopes in himſelf, he aimed by a daring and unexpected ſtroke, to draw even from ſo ſevere a misfortune ſome new and more brilliant advantages.</p>
                        <p>In purſance of the plan he had laid,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 2."/> 

 he diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all things for a march towards Sileſia, and had paſſed the Elbe and penetrated through a woody coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try without oppoſition; had the enemy been appriſed of his march as early as he began it, it had been attended with great and unſurmountable difficulties. Marſhal Daun no ſooner had advice of his march, than he alſo immediately moved with the utmoſt expedition at the head of his main army towards Sileſia, leaving the army of the empire, and a body under General Lacy, to awe Saxony in his abſence.</p>
                        <p>The two armies continued their route through Luſatia; that of the King of Pruſſia a little to the northward, that of Marſhal Daun to the ſouthward; both apparently puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the ſame object, and with equal eagerneſs. But as the army of the marſhal had rather the ſhorter cut to make, and as he moved with far greater and more unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected diligence, he got very conſiderably the ſtart of the King.</p>
                        <p>When his majeſty was appriſed that M. Daun had gained full two days march upon him;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 8."/> 

 that he had actually arrived at Gorlitz, and was puſhing by forced marches to Lauban; his great purpoſe was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Immediately he ſtruck into M. Daun's track, but wheeled into the oppoſite direction, repaſſed the Spree near Bautzen, and whilſt every one imagined him on the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of Sileſia, he ſuddenly ſprung up like a mine before Dreſden. The army of the Empire retired. Lacy's corps was obliged to ſhift its ſituation. The Pruſſian generals Hulſen and Ziethen, who had probably been prepared to act in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert with the King, joined him before that place, and knowing there was no room for delay,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 13."/> 

 began the ſiege with the utmoſt vigour.</p>
                        <p>Then was this moſt unfortunate city a third time expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the fury of war. The inhabitants ſuffered in their habitations for the weakneſs of the works; and there were armies both without and within of ſuch mutual and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:1261701201:318"/>
rage, and ſo careleſs of all things but their enmity, that they little ſcrupled to ſtrike at each other through the bodies of the ſuffering Saxons. All Europe had now its eyes turned to the event of this maſterly manoeuvre; and certainly through the whole courſe of this eventful war, nothing appeared more worthy of regard, nor at any time had there been exhibited a piece of generalſhip more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, than the conduct of the King of Pruſſia's march.</p>
                        <p>Since Dreſden had fallen into the hands of the Auſtrians, it had been ſtrengthened with the addition of ſeveral new works. The burning of the ſuburbs by the Pruſſians, in order to keep them out, became an advantage to them when they came to poſſeſs the town. In ſhort, the place, was rendered in all reſpects more defenſible than formerly. It had alſo a very large garriſon under General Macguire, an officer of courage and experience, who reſolved to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it to the laſt extremity: when he was ſummoned to ſurrender, he made anſwer, "That it was impoſſible the king could have been appriſed with his being entruſted with the command of that capital; otherwiſe ſo great a captain as his majeſty would not make ſuch a propoſal to an officer of his ſtanding: that he would defend himſelf to the laſt man; and wait whatever the king ſhould think proper to attempt."</p>
                        <p>Both parties being therefore inſpired with the utmoſt reſolution, the one to attack, the other to defend, the ſiege was puſhed on by every method of force and addreſs; there was ſcarce any intermiſſion of aſſaults, ſurprizes, coups de mains, ſallies, and all kind of actions uſed on ſuch occaſions; and all the moſt vigorous in their way. In the mean time three batteries of cannon and mortars played continually, but with much greater damage to the buildings than effect on the fortifications.</p>
                        <p>Marſhal Daun was in Sileſia when he heard all at once of the deceit put upon him by the King of Pruſſia, of his return to Saxony, of the ſiege, and the extreme danger of Dreſden. His return was as rapid as his march had been. On the 19th he appeared within a league of Dreſden. His approach only cauſed the Pruſſians to redouble their efforts; that day they had received reinforcements of heavy cannon and mortars, and battered the place with new fury. The cathedral church, the new ſquare, ſeveral principal ſtreets, ſome palaces, the noble manufactory of porcelain, were all entirely reduced to aſhes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="277" facs="tcp:1261701201:319"/>The ſiege continued till the 22d. The night of the 21ſt, M. Daun had thrown ſixteen battalions into Dreſden. It was in vain to continue any longer the pretence of beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a whole army within the town, whilſt at the ſame time there was another army to reinforce it without. The king withdrew his forces without moleſtation from the ſuburbs, though there were three conſiderable armies of the enemy in the neighbourhood, beſides that which was within the walls.</p>
                        <p>Thus ended, without the ſucceſs ſo maſterly, a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſerved, the King of Pruſſia's famous ſtratagem. But the want of ſucceſs can detract nothing from the merit of the meaſure. By drawing Marſhal Daun from Saxony to Sileſia he gained the uſe of eight days, free of obſtruction from the enemy's grand army; eight days at a time when hours and even moments were critical. In this time he had certainly a chance at leaſt of reducing Dreſden; and by the poſſeſſion of that place he would have found himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely better able to carry his arms to the defence of every part of his territories for the preſent, and for the future would have that great place of retreat in caſe of any misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. If he failed in this attempt his affairs were preciſely in their former condition; and he could not ſuffer in repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by having made it.</p>
                        <p>As the King of Pruſſia could not be blamed for the ſpeedy return of Marſhal Daun, and the conſequences of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; ſo neither in effect could the Marſhal ſuffer any juſt imputation in having been deceived by the king's march. He knew that there were very plauſible motives to call, and even to preſs him to move that way. He knew that if the king ſhould get into Sileſia without any oppoſition from him, Laudohn might not only be deprived of all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages he could hope for from his late victory, but by being attacked by the united armies of the king and his brother, would run the riſque of a defeat that might fully revenge that of Landſhut.</p>
                        <p>Whatever the merit of either of the commanders might be on this occaſion, it is certain that Laudohn met no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable obſtruction.</p>
                        <p>But Laudohn who ſaw all things prepared for an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate defence, did not wholly truſt to his military manoeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres. He ſent a letter to the governor Count Tavenzien, to intimidate him by the diſplay of his ſtrength. He ſet
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:1261701201:320"/>
forth, that his forces conſiſted of 50 battalions and 80 ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons; that the Ruſſian army of 75,000 men were within three days march; that it was in vain for the governor to expect ſuccour from the King of Pruſſia, who was then at the other ſide of the Elbe, that it was ſtill more vain to look for relief from Prince Henry, who could ſcarce hope to ſtand his own ground againſt the grand army of the Ruſſians; that in caſe of obſtinacy he could expect no reaſonable terms: and that theſe were the laſt that ſhould be offered. Moreover he reminded him that the place was a mercantile town, not a fortreſs; and that he could not defend it without contravening the laws of war.</p>
                        <p>Theſe rules, by which honour is reduced to act, not by its own feelings, but according to intrinſical circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; rules by which they have attempted to determine exactly and mechanically that niceſt of all lines which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminates courage from raſhneſs, form one of the ſtrongeſt inſtances of the great difference between the antient and modern methods and ideas of war. In the antient times, a brave commander would have anſwered this threatning meſſage in general terms of defiance. But Count Taven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zien reſpected theſe imaginary laws. He took care to prove that in defending the town, he did not infringe them; and ſpoke as Laudohn had done in the character of a military juriſconſult, as well as a ſoldier; he gave for reply. That the town of Breſlaw being ſurrounded with works and wet ditches, was to be conſidered as a place of ſtrength, and not ſimply as a mercantile town. That the Auſtrians themſelves defended it as ſuch in 1757, after the battle of Liſſa. That the king had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to defend it to the laſt extremity, that therefore General Laudohn might ſee it was not from humour he had refuſed to liſten to his ſummons. That he was not frighted with the General's threats to deſtroy the town; for he was not entruſted with the care of the houſes, but the fortifications.</p>
                        <p>Laudohn had alſo ſent in a memorial in the ſame menac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtile, where he thought it might have a greater effect, to the civil magiſtrates, hoping that the ruin with which the town was threatened, might induce them join with the inhabitants, to perſuade the governor to a ſpeedy ſurrender.</p>
                        <p>All theſe menacing meaſures ſeemed to argue a fear in
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1261701201:321"/>
Baron Laudohn, that the Ruſſians were not ſo near as he pretended, and that the town might poſſibly be releived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their arrival. However he ſhewed them, at nine of the very evening of the meſſage, that his threats were not vain, by a terrible diſcharge of mortars and red hot balls that fell in an uninterrupted ſhower upon the city untill midnight. During this fierce bombardment, that made a dreadful havock in the town, he attempted the out-works by aſſault. His Croats attacked the covered-way in many places at once, with the uſual impetuoſity of thoſe brave irregulars; but they were received and repulſed with a reſolution equal to their own, and with more ſteadineſs.</p>
                        <p>This operation of this dreadful night having made no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the inflexible determination of the governor, Baron Laudohn had once more recourſe to negotiation. He now changed his ſtile, and held out the moſt flattering pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; offering to grant him what capitulations he ſhould think proper to aſk, and even to leave himſelf to draw up the articles. The governor replied that the firing the town had made no change in his reſolution; and he would wait with firmneſs for the enemy upon the ramparts; but that he could not help obſerving it was contrary to the laws of arms to begin the ſiege of a fortreſs, by ruining its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. The meſſenger made anſwer, that the trenches would be ſoon opened. The governor ſaid, it was what he had long expected.</p>
                        <p>The Auſtrians, foiled in their hopes from treaty, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to batter the town, and made ſeveral attacks upon the out-works for three days ſucceſſively. They found every poſt bravely defended; the Ruſſian army did not appear, but they now began to perceive the approach of another army leſs agreeable; that of Prince Henry; which having marched with the utmoſt diligence from Great Glogau, now came faſt upon him; and on the 5th of Auguſt, reached within a few miles of the town.</p>
                        <p>Laudohn did not think it expedient to put the advantage he had gained, and thoſe which he had yet to expect from the management of time, to the iſſue of a battle; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore decamped and made his retreat in good order, but with ſufficient quickneſs; having procured from this enterpriſe only the wretched ſatisfaction of reducing a great part of the city to a heap of rubbiſh, and of having revenged upon Breſlaw ſome part of the ſufferings of Dreſden.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE French and allied armies had been reinforced in the manner we have already mentioned. But the vigour of their operations did not altogether correſpond with what might have been expected from their ſtrength and mutual animoſity. The campaign, at leaſt in any effective manner, opened late. A country which had been ſo long the theatre of ſo ruinous a war, had been too much waſted to make the ſubſiſtence, and conſequently the free motion of the armies eaſy. The winter had been ſevere and long; and it was not untill the green forage appeared plentifully above ground, that thoſe great bodies of cavalry, which make ſo large a part in our modern armies, were in a condition to act. The ſufferings of the Engliſh horſe, from a want of dry forage, during a great part of the winter and the ſpring had been extreme; this obliged them to fall much farther back from the French cantonments; and to moleſt them leſs than they otherwiſe would have done. It was beſides a loſs, that at the opening of the campaign, they had ſo extenſive a tract between them and Hanover; which by an artful choice of poſts might have been yielded ſtep by ſtep, and the campaign ſo managed and ſpun out, that the ſeaſon of action muſt have expired, before the French could have reaped any deciſive advantage from their ſuperiority.</p>
                        <p>Although the French were during the winter ſupplied far better than the allies with all neceſſaries by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Maine, the Moſelle and the Rhine; and that the countries at their back had been much leſs conſumed by the war; yet the ſame difficulties embarraſſed them as ſoon as they thought of taking the field, and quitting their advantageous cantonment. Therefore there was a ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the principal armies upon both parts, until the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of ſummer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="281" facs="tcp:1261701201:323"/>Not however, but that ſomething was attempted in this interval, by leſſer parties. On the ſide of the Rhine, ſome actions happened between the army of St. Germain, and the corps of General Sporken, who was poſted at Dulmen, to obſerve the French in that quarter. Dulmen formed the right flank of the chain of cantonments made by the allied army, which extended its left to the ſouth-eaſt fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of the country of Heſſe, above an hundred and fifty miles diſtant. The Hereditary Prince who was on that wing, exerted, as much as circumſtances would permit, his uſual activity and enterprize. He threw himſelf into the diſtrict of Fulda; he laid it under an heavy contribution and broke up ſeveral French corps that were poſted there.</p>
                        <p>Theſe actions decided nothing. The French army ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior in numbers, and in ſituation, advanced; and the allies, who ſeemed to have choſen the defenſive, gradually retired. In effect, if the French had purſued their original plan, it would have proved almoſt impoſſible for the allied army to maintain its ground. If St. Germain, poſſeſſed of Cleves, Weſel, and Duſſeldorp, had advanced on the ſide of Munſter; and M. Broglio moving forward through the country of Heſſe, had made a ſtrong detachment to the eaſtward of the Weſer, whilſt with his main body he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the attention of Prince Ferdinand, the allies would ſhortly have found themſelves encloſed upon three ſides; and nothing could have extricated them but a capital vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory obtained under every diſadvantage.</p>
                        <p>The French army was ſufficiently numerous for theſe operations. But it was ſuſpected that the jealouſy which ſubſiſted between M. de St. Germain and the Duke of Broglio prevented their being carried into execution. This miſunderſtanding daily increaſed. Inſomuch, that M. Broglio thought fit to order the corps of St. Germain to unite itſelf with the grand army. The count, who could not brook obedience to a younger officer, and one beſides with whom he was not on the beſt terms, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from the ſervice.

 He had only ſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon condition of commanding an army en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely diſtinct, and under his own particular orders. This difference deprived France of one of its moſt able generals, and diſconcerted one of its moſt promiſed ſchemes of operation.</p>
                        <p>Before this miſunderſtanding had produced theſe effects,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:1261701201:324"/>
the affairs of the French went on with all imaginable proſperity. The principal army not retarding itſelf, by conſideration of the places of ſtrength which the allies poſſeſſed in their front, the caſtles of Marburg and Dillen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, puſhed forward into the landgraviate of Heſſe, leaving detachments to reduce thoſe fortreſſes. The firſt of which ſurrendered on the 30th of June, the latter held out to the 16th of July; but the garriſons of both ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered priſoners of war.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time whilſt M. Broglio advanced on the ſide of Heſſe;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 10."/> 

 the corps of St. Germain had penetrated through the dutchy of Weſtphalia, and the two armies joined near a place called Corbach. The allied army had fallen back from the poſt they occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied at Fritzlar, and were retreating towards the river Dymel. As yet they had received no advice of the dreaded junction of the French armies; but as it was imagined that the corps of St. Germain only moved that way, and the vanguard only of that corps could be arrived at Corbach, which could not be eſtimated at more than 10,000 foot, and 17 ſquadrons at the utmoſt, the Hereditary Prince formed a ſceme of attacking and driving them from that poſt.</p>
                        <p>When he had begun the attack, contrary to his expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he found the enemy already formed; but it was now impoſſible to recede. The action grew every moment more furious and bloody. The French ſtood their ground with firmneſs, and the main army being extremely near, inſtead of being waſted in the action, they grew more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous by the reinforcements that were continually ſent.</p>
                        <p>In this ſituation it was neceſſary that the Prince ſhould make as ſpeedy a retreat as poſſible; but the difficulty of drawing out of the field in the middle of the day, before an enemy quite freſh, and every inſtant reinforced, may be eaſily imagined. To compleat this difficulty, ſome bodies of the German troops both horſe and foot fell into great confuſion. The enemy ſaw it at the firſt glance, and to increaſe it to the utmoſt diſorder, puſhed forward upon them with a numerous artillery and a large body of cavalry. The allied army ſeemed to be in the way of inevitable ruin.</p>
                        <p>In this exigence the Hereditary Prince, as his laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource, put himſelf at the head of a ſquadron of Bland's and Howard's regiments of dragroons. By theſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:1261701201:325"/>
heroiſm of their young leader was perfectly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded. They charged the enemy with the utmoſt fury, ſtopped their career of their victorious horſe; and enabled the alied battalions to make an undiſturbed retreat.</p>
                        <p>The Hereditary Prince was wounded in this action; about 900 men were killed, wounded, or priſoners, fifteen pieces of cannon, the whole of the artillery, was left to the enemy, but ſtill in their circumſtances to have avoided a total defeat, was in ſome ſort victory. The well-timed impetuoſity of the Hereditary Prince, and the ſpirit of the Engliſh horſe, could not be too highly praiſed. The Prince retired to the main army of the allies, who had now poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves of the ſtrong poſt of Saxenhauſen: whilſt the French continued oppoſite to them in the no leſs ſtrong poſt of Corbach, which they had acquired by their victory; and here for ſome time they watched each other.</p>
                        <p>The Hereditary Prince ſuffered more by this check than from the wounds he had received. His mind, forgetful of his pain and weakneſs, only brooding over his defeat, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out with anxiety an opportunity of revenging his loſs by ſome bold, ſignal, and unexpected ſtroke againſt the enemy. It was not long before an opportunity preſented itſelf.</p>
                        <p>Advice had been received, that among the detachments which the French employed to reduce thoſe fortreſſes which the allies had garriſoned on their retreat, there was one very conſiderable, formed of French and Saxon, under Monſ. Glaubitz, moving towards Zigenhagen, a place of importance in the landgrave of Heſſe. The Hereditary Prince undertook to relieve it, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſelected ſix battalions of the German troops,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14 July."/> 

 two brigades of hunters, a regiment of huſſars, and Eliot's light dragoons. Although this laſt corps was but juſt arrived, had been newly raiſed, and had never ſeen any kind of ſervice, the Prince was ſo well pleaſed with their countenance, that he choſe them preferably to all other for his difficult enterprize, and the event proved that he was not miſtaken.</p>
                        <p>Monſ. Glaubitz remained in the moſt perfect ſecurity; he was under no ſort of apprehenſion of being moleſted by a detachment of an army ſixty miles diſtance, under the eye, and as it were, guard of a ſuperior body which

                        <p>Glaubitz had ſcarce time to form his troops; and they were only formed to be immediately broken. They retired with precipitation, leaving their camp and all it contained to the enemy. The Prince had ſo diſpoſed his cavalry as to cut off the retreat of ſome; but the moſt conſiderable part gained ground upon him. On this occaſion he relied entirely on Elliot's horſe, as it was altogether impoſſible for the infantry, already haraſſed by the action, and a moſt fatiguing forced march of two days, to follow them. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing routed this, with the like rapidity, he flew to another body who had taken poſt near a wood, ſurrounded them in the ſame manner; ſummoned and received them all priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of war. A regiment of the enemy's huſſars was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely cut to pieces. Nothing was wanting to compleat his victory. Elliot's light horſe, proud to be led on by the Prince himſelf, and worthy of that honour, had the greateſt ſhare of the glory and ſufferings of that day. So young a corps had never ſo eminently diſtinguiſhed itſelf. No more than 79 of the allies were killed in this action, but of theſe 71 were of this ſingle regiment.</p>
                        <p>The numbers of the enemy killed is not known, but for a time the ſlaughter was terrible. General Glaubitz himſelf was made priſoner, together with the Prince of Anhalt. There were beſides 177 officers, and 2482 private men. A greater number of priſoners could ſcarely be expected from a victory in a general engagement. The trophies were nine pair of colours and ſix pieces of cannon. In all the <hi>Petite Gurre</hi> of this campaign, (and the campaign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the French and the allies was almoſt wholly made up of ſuch,) this was by far the moſt billiant action; and alone might have eſtabliſhed the reputation of the Hereditary Prince, if any thing had been wanting to eſtabliſh him the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1261701201:327"/>
firſt man of his age, in that ſpecies of war. He returned to the camp of Saxenhauſen, without moleſtation, having fully revenged the affair of Corbach.</p>
                        <p>Prince Ferdinand did not remain long after this action in his camp at Saxenhauſen. By ſo advanced a poſition, the landgraviate, and even Hanover, lay too open to the enemies incurſions. He therefore took his camp at a place called Kalle, in a ſituation nearer to Caſſel On this M. Broglio formed a plan, which the greatneſs of his army in ſome ſort enabled him to execute. The Chevalier de Muy, who commanded in the room of the Count St. Germain, was ordered to croſs the Dymel at Statbergen, with his reſerve, conſiſting of 35,000 men, in order to cut off the allies from their communication with Weſtphalia. Whilſt the reſt of the French, dividing themſelves into two bodies, moved, the main army under M. Broglio towards Duke Ferdinand's camp at Kalle, the reſerve under Prince Xavier of Saxony towards Caſſel.</p>
                        <p>Theſe important movements obliged Prince Ferdinand to ſet himſelf alſo in motion; and as he was not in a condition to make detachments of ſufficient ſtrength, he croſſed the Dymel with his grand army, in order to fight the Chevalier de Muy.</p>
                        <p>His Serene Highneſs formed his main body on the heights of Corbach,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31 July."/> 

 and moved towards the enemy, who were advantageouſly poſted near Warbourg; in the mean time the Hereditary Prince with two columns wheeled round the enemy's left, and began a vigorous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack at once upon that flank, and upon their rear. The French commander poured reinforcements on that quarter. An hot engagement was there maintained with equal obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy for near four hours. Whilſt this combat continued with uncertain fortune on the left, Prince Ferdinand cauſed ſome bodies to file off towards the French bridges on the Dymel to their right, by which he propoſed to attack alſo on that ſide, and intercept them on their retreat; at the ſame time the main of his army advanced with the utmoſt expedition to charge the enemy in front.</p>
                        <p>The French now ſaw themſelves in the moſt imminent danger of being ſurrounded. Already their left, attacked in flank and rear by the Hereditary Prince, began to give way: his fire became every moment ſuperior; and the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt retreat was the ſafeſt.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>FROM the time that the King of Pruſſia found himſelf compelled to raiſe the ſiege of Dreſden, it was evident that he could have no hopes of acting in Saxony to any good purpoſe. The buſy part of the campaign came on faſt. Though Prince Henry had obliged Laudohn to retire from Breſlaw; that general, able, and lately victorious, was ſtill formidable; he kept Neiſſe and Schweidnitz blocked up; and wanted to effect a junction with the Ruſſians, by which he propoſed to give the final blow to the king's power in Sileſia, The Ruſſians had now actually arrived in the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier parts of that province, and wanted but a very few days eaſy march to compleat that fatal and long dreaded junction. At the ſame time another body of Ruſſians had penetrated into Pomerania; laid all the defenceleſs parts under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, and threatened the ſiege of Colberg: The Swediſh army, ſaid to conſiſt of 22,000 men, commenced alſo, tho' with leſs vigour, their operations. In all that country the King of Pruſſia had not 5000 men to oppoſe them.</p>
                        <p>In theſe circumſtances a plan of mere defence would have proved altogether without effect. The King of Pruſſia had but two armies; and it was neceſſary that one of them, at leaſt, ſhould make the moſt rapid and ſudden movements to oppoſe ſo many combinations. On the ſide of Sileſia the danger ſeemed more preſſing, and accordingly he marched to its relief;

 advanced near two hundred miles, and left Marſhal Daun, who had conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the ſtart, far behind him. This march would have been thought an aſtoniſhing exploit in a partizan at the head of a ſmall and diſencumbered corps; but that a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous army clogged with its artillery, with above two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand waggons, ſhould in that time traverſe ſuch a ſpace,

                           <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bered the bad guard which had been kept by the Pruſſians and the advantage, which in the year 1758 he derived fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in their camps, and to have the drums beat the tattoo as uſual.</p>
                        <p>Some time after Marſhal Daun had begun to move, to his aſtoniſhment the patroles he had ſent out returned with the account, that they had met no out-poſts. As ſoon as day broke and the army had advanced, their apprehenſions were confirmed. They were diſappointed in their deſign, there was no enemy in the camp; but when they caſt their eyes from thence, they could perceive at a diſtance the riſing of a thick ſmoke, which left them no room to doubt that their fortune was then on the point of deciſion, by a part of their forces only, and that the King and Baron Laudohn were at that moment hotly engaged; Daun could only look on and wait the event.</p>
                        <p>On the 13th of July the king was in his camp at Lignitz, when he received advice that the Ruſſian army of 24,000 men, under Count Czernichew, had thrown bridges over the Oder, at a place called Auras, and that they were to paſs the river on that very day. He ſuſpected alſo, that the enemy had formed the deſign of a general attack. Troops which have been a long time oppoſed to each other can reciprocally gueſs at each other's deſigns; the method uſed by the enemies generals grow familiar, and the leaſt motion they make diſcloſes their deſigns.</p>
                        <p>This is the account the Pruſſians gave of the means by which they came to a knowledge of M. Daun's projects. The Auſtrians attributed this diſcovery, not to the Pruſſian ſagacity, but to intelligence given by deſerters.</p>
                        <p>Whatever the means were by which the King of Pruſſia became ſuſpicious of this deſign, it is certain, that he took the moſt early, the moſt vigorous, and the moſt effective mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to defeat it. He was thoroughly ſenſible of the danger he ran of being ſurrounded, if he continued in his poſt at Lignitz; out of that very deſign, which was calculated for his ruin, his genius drew a new means of ſafety. He ſaw at a glance, that the plan which the enemy had formed to ſurround him, at the ſame time, neceſſarily divided their own armies. And this diviſion was the great object he had purſued ſo long, and thro' ſuch diſcouraging diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. His only buſineſs was to prevent their reuniting in a general attack upon his quarters. Therefore in the very evening calculated for the attempt on his camp, he quitted it with as much privacy as the enemy had propoſed to attack

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:1261701201:339"/>
way on either ſide, until ſix. The King of Pruſſia exerted himſelf with incredible diligence to preſerve an uniform ſtrength in every part of his line, and hazarded his own life with a daring, which nothing but his ſituation could excuſe from temerity. His cloaths were ſhot through in ſeveral places, his horſe was killed under him. But all theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and dangers were fully compenſated by the efforts of his troops, who maintained ſo ſteady a fire, and puſhed the Auſtrians with ſo much ardour, that they at laſt gave ground, and retreated with precipitation, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome order, towards the Katſbach.</p>
                        <p>The king purſued them to this river, and no further. His advantage as it was gained by the moſt vigorous ſteps, ſo bounds were ſet to the ardour of improving it with the moſt guarded caution. He feared if he purſued his ſucceſs too far, it might disjoin the part of the army en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged from that which he had left to obſerve M. Daun; and perhaps give that general an opportunity of taking a ſevere revenge on the right, for the ſucceſſes of the left. Notwithſtanding this reſerve of the king, (a reſerve, the want of which was formerly the only failing in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary character, but which his misfortunes had now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly taught him,) notwithſtanding, I ſay he did not puſh his good fortune againſt Baron Laudohn to the utmoſt, the victory was compleat, glorious, and adorned with all the trophies. By their own confeſſion, the Auſtrians loſt upwards of 6000 men, killed, wounded and priſoners. The Pruſſians made it amount, and not without proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to 10,000. Among the priſoners, were two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and 84 officers; 82 pieces of cannon and 23 pair of colours were taken. On the ſide of the conquerors, five hundred were killed, and 1200 wounded.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Sileſia, the victory near Lignitz produced ſome moſt immediate, and moſt uſeful effects. Although M. Daun, not diſpirited with his late miſadventure, and only ſollicitous to repair his loſs, had detached a ſtrong corps under Prince Lowenſtein, and Gen. Beck to ſtrengthen the Ruſſians and encourage them to advance. Count Czerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew was ſo intimidated with the late defeat of the Auſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that he repaſſed the Oder by the ſame bridges on which he had lately croſſed it.</p>
                        <p>Thus one great end of the King of Pruſſia's march was obtained. He prevented the dreaded junction of thoſe two

                        <p>The king after this victory joined his brother Prince Henry at Newmarcke. One part of that Prince's army under General Goltze had paſſed the Oder to obſerve the Ruſſians, who ſince the repaſſing that river, ſeemed to direc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>Whilſt his majeſty was thus exerting the moſt heroic ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in defence of Sileſia; Gen. Hulſen, who commanded for him in Saxony, ſeconded his endeavours in that quarter with uncommon bravery and ſucceſs. The army of the empire had formed a deſign of cutting him off from Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gau. To fruſtrate their intentions, that general quitted his camp at Meiſſen, and marched to Strehla. The enemy divided into two bodies; one attacked an advanced poſt about a cannon ſhot from his camp upon every ſide, with the greateſt fury from, day break to ſix in the morning,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 20."/> 

 whilſt another corps was ſo placed as to keep his camp in awe, and to prevent his
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:1261701201:341"/>
attempting any thing for the relief of the advanced poſt. Gen Hulſen ſaw that unleſs he could ſpeedily do ſomething for its ſuccour, that body muſt inevitably periſh. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this exigency, gave orders to his cavalry to make a circuit round an height; and to charge if poſſible the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies flank. This order was executed with the utmoſt promptitude and ſpirit. The Imperialiſts were charged on their flanks; their battalions and horſe were thrown upon one another in confuſion, and 41 officers and 1200 men were made priſoners, The loſs of the Pruſſians was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. Gen. Hulſen by this advantage, was enabled to encamp under To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

This retreat made the Auſtrians magnify the affair into a victory on their ſide; but the circumſtances render the Pruſſian account much more probable.</p>
                        <p>Fortune ſeemed once more to have ſmiled, after a long interval of gloom on the King of Pruſſia's affairs; and the reputation of his arms began to revive. But the victories he obtained, though glorious, were deciſive of little more than the field upon which they were fought. They were far from having lowered the power of the enemy to an equality with his. And the movements he made to gain thoſe advantages, and to protect one part of his dominions neceſſarily expoſed the reſt. The enemy was able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach without end; and whilſt bodies of Ruſſians traverſed the Lower Sileſia, ſeveral corps of Auſtrians ſcoured Luſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia; and thus together they broke off all regular commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication between the king's army and his hereditary domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and of courſe between him and his general Hulſen, who with very unequal forces was ſtruggling to ſecure Saxony; a country in which there are towns indeed forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; but fortified for the greater part in ſuch a manner, as to be little more than ſnares for increaſing the number of priſoners, by betraying defenceleſs garriſons into the hands of an enemy ſuperior in the field.</p>
                        <p>In this ſituation, the king is ſaid to have wrote a letter to the celebrated

<note n="(1)" place="bottom">Author of the Jewiſh Spy, &amp;c. and now reſident at Berlin.</note>

that I can acquaint them with. If the blow that I me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate ſucceeds, then, my dear marquis, it will be time enough to expreſs our joy: but till then, let us not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ourſelves, for fear ſome unexpected bad news ſhould detect us too much.</q>

                           <q>I lead here the life of a millitary monk. I have much to think off about my affairs, and the reſt of my time I devote to literature, which is my conſolation, as it was of the conſul, the father of his country and of eloquence. I know not if I ſhall ſurvive this war, but I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, in caſe it ſhould happen, to paſs the reſt of my days in retirement, in the boſom of philoſophy and friendſhip.</q>

                           <q>Well, my dear marquis, what is become of the peace with France? Your nation, you ſee, is more blind, than you imagined. Thoſe fools loſe Canada, and Pondicher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to pleaſe the Queen and the Czarina. Heaven grant that Prince Ferdinand may well reward them for their zeal.

 they divided into three bodies, which took three differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent routs, by which the place was compleatly ſurrounded. At eight in the evening, they ſet out from Warbourg, and came before this place at two the following morning. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the precautions taken, the trampling of the troops over the gardens gave the alarm to a guard of the enemies dragoons, who immediately began to fire. Strict orders had been given to proceed with as little alarm as poſſible, and to reſerve their fire; and ſuch was the delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate courage, ſuch the perfect diſcipline of the Engliſh gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers, that they ſuſtained this fire, puſhed on with bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, drove back the enemies piquets, killed the guard at the gate, and entered the town along with the fugitives, without the leaſt noiſe, hurry, or confuſion.

The night was ſo dark that they formed by the ſide of the French, who for a while took them to be their own piquets that had aſſembled; but they were ſoon undeceived; a fierce encounter with bayonets enſued, in which the French were quickly obliged to give way.</p>

He came up with their rear as they were paſſing the river Orche,

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:1261701201:351"/>
and that Oſtend, which the Empreſs ſo unpolitically for herſelf, and ſo ungratefully to her former friends, had given into the hands of France, would be the firſt object of thoſe forces which were to unite from ſuch a diſtance.</p>
                        <p>This deſign of the expedition from Portſmouth has, we underſtand, been formerly diſavowed. Whether in ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not being a principal in the war, with her imperial majeſty, England ought to have made ſuch an attempt, though Oſtend was defended by a French garriſon, we ſhall not take upon us to determine; but without the aid of ſuch conſiderations, it is evident there were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient objections to it from the ſide of mere prudence. Almoſt inſuperable difficulties occurred in ſuch a ſcheme; and it would ſcarcely appear to moſt men adviſeable to add a Flemiſh to our German war.</p>
                        <p>But we think it poſſible to give ſome reaſonable account of the expedition of the Hereditary Prince, independent of any connection with the Britiſh armament. For a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time the French had ſeemed reſolved to reſume their former plan of an army on the Lower Rhine; ſuch motions were made as ſtrongly indicated that this deſign would ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be put in execution; and the allied army had every thing to fear from it. For as the French were checked from proceeding to the compleat conqueſt of the electorate by the allied, army on the Dymel, if this army ſhould itſelf be ſo checked, by one of the enemy advancing from the Lower Rhine, there would be then nothing to hinder M. Broglio from ſending forward ſo ſtrong a reſerve as might finally reduce Hanover. In theſe circumſtances nothing but a very deciſive victory could poſſibly ſave the allied ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, thus ſurrounded and deprived of its ſubſiſtence, from periſhing in the moſt miſerable, or ſurrendering in the moſt ſhameful manner.</p>
                        <p>There was one ſtep only which might with certainty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this deſign, and even in ſome meaſure turn it upon the enemy; the taking Cleves and Weſel into the hands of the allies. This would not only defeat the ſcheme of the French for acting on the Lower Rhine, but greatly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs their operations in every other quarter. Even the attempt, though it ſhould not be attempted with ſucceſs, would neceſſarily draw the attention of the French that way, and thus ſave Hanover at leaſt for one campaign. This alone had been a ſufficient reaſon for the march. But

But before the enemy could diſturb him, nature declared againſt his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs by the fall of immenſe rains, which ſwelled the Rhine and Lippe to ſuch a degree as greatly interrupted the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the ſiege, having rendered the roads of Weſtphalia impaſſable, and therefore prevented the arrival of theſe reinforcements which were intended to puſh the ſiege with the greater effect. Theſe rains alſo made it very difficult for the prince to preſerve his communication with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers, which however he made a ſhift to keep open by one bridge above and another below the town,</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, the French with all the expedition they could uſe, had collected an army under M. de Caſtrie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This body advanced as far as Rheinberg, and after a ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſiſtance drove out a detachment of the allies which had been poſted there.

The Hereditary Prince now ſaw at the ſame time the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and a ſuperior army acting againſt him, to fight this enemy, fully prepared to receive him, with the troops which he could ſpare from the ſiege, might be a deſperate attempt.

This attempt became the more neceſſary, and the leſs time was to be loſt in making it, as intelligence had been received that the French army was ſhortly to be

augmented by powerful reinforcements. The prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his march at ten in the evening.</p>
                        <p>To reach the enemy's camp, it was neceſſary to diſlodge Fiſcher's corps of irregulars, who had occupied the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of Campen in their front. This produced ſome ſhot,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Oct. 16."/> 

 and this ſhot alarmed the whole French army, which immediately got under arms and poſted themſelves in a wood. The allied troops puſhed forward, twice repulſed the French, and with the moſt noble perſeverance reiterated their attacks on the wood, and kept up a terrible and well ſupplied fire for ſixteen hours without intermiſſion, that is from five in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame evening at nine. There have been few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſo obſtinate a combat. But at length finding night approach, the troops harraſſed, their ammunition ſpent, and all hopes vain of diſlodging a ſuperior enemy from an advantageous poſt, the Hereditary Prince having had an horſe killed under him, and being himſelf wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was with regret compelled to retire. Eleven hundred and ſeventy of the allies were killed and wounded in this bloody action; about 500 were made priſoners. The loſs of the French was far greater but they had the field.</p>
                        <p>On this occaſion, the Engliſh nation regretted the loſs of one of its moſt ſhining ornaments in the death of Lord Downe, who whilſt his grateful ſovereign was diſtining him to higher honours, received a mortal wound in this battle. He was a perſon of free and pleaſurable life: but of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent underſtanding, amiable manners, and the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepid courage. In the beginning of this war he had a conſiderable ſhare in rouſing a martial ſpirit amongſt the young people of rank in England, and having long ſhewed them by a gallant example how to fight, he at laſt by a melancholy one, ſhewed them how to die for their country.</p>
                        <p>As the britiſh troops had been the greateſt ſufferers in this as well as in moſt other actions of the campaign, great murmers were raiſed againſt the commander of the allied army, as if upon all occaſions, even the moſt trivial, he had wantonly expoſed the lives of the Britiſh, in order to preſerve thoſe of the German ſoldiery. Some carried this complaint to a ridiculous length.

engaged by an event of the greateſt importance, and which many were of opinion would make no ſmall change in the nature of the war, and above all in the general ſyſtem of pacification. This was the death of George II. king of Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>He died ſuddenly in his palace at Kenſington in the 77th year of his age and 33d of his reign. The immediate cauſe of his death was the rupture of the ſubſtance of the right ventricle of his heart, by which the circulation was ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in an inſtant. This was preceded by no ſort of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent illneſs. His majeſty enjoyed an uncommon degree of health and ſtrength for that age; but it was believed that he had ſuffered, by expoſing himſelf too much to the cold, in reviewing ſome troops that were to be embarked for the expedition. He had been extremely ſolicitous about the fortune of this expedition. He had been no leſs anxious for the fate of the enterpriſe under the Hereditary Prince, an account of the ill ſucceſs of which he had received, tho' it was not at that time made public. This was believed to have touched him deeply, and to have been one of the cauſes of a death ſo afflicting to all his people.</p>
                        <p>When future hiſtorians come to ſpeak of his late majeſty, they will find both in his fortune and his virtue, abundant matter for juſt and unſuſpected panegyric. None of his predeſſors in the throne of England lived to ſo great an age; few of them enjoyed ſo long a reign. And this long courſe was diſtinguiſhed by circumſtances of peculiar feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, whether we conſider him in the public or the private character. His ſubjects, allowing for one ſhort and as it were momentary cloud, enjoyed perpetual peace at home, and abroad on many occaſions accquired great glory There was to the laſt a conſiderable increaſe in their agriculture, their commerce, and their manufactures, which were daily improving under the internal tranquility they enjoyed, and the wiſe regulations that were made in every ſeſſion of his parliaments. By a wonderful happineſs, he left theſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements no way checked, but rather forwarded, in one of the moſt general and waſteful wars that has raged in the world for many centuries.</p>
                        <p>He lived entirely to extinguiſh party and the ſpirit of party in his kingdoms; it was not till the cloſe of his reign, that his family might have been conſidered as firmly and immoveably ſeated on the throne; but he, having baffled

and we do not hazard any thing in aſſerting, that if it had not been for the prudent foreſight of that meaſure, the army which has ſince been formed, and the great things which have ſince been done, could never have had exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. So that if we only examine what he has done in Germany, when we reflect what enemies ſecret and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared he had at different times to manage and to fight in that country, he muſt in every fair judgment be allowed the greateſt prince of his family.</p>
                        <p>He was in his temper ſudden and violent; but this, tho' it influenced his behaviour, made no impreſſion on his conduct, which was always ſufficiently deliberate and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to his own intereſts and thoſe of his ſubjects.</p>
                        <p>He was plain and direct in his intentions; true to his word; ſteady in his favour and protection to his ſervants, and never changed them willingly; this appeared clearly in thoſe who ſerved more immediately on his perſon, whom he ſcarce ever removed; but they grew old along with him, or died in their places. But having been in a ſort compelled by a violent faction, to relinquiſh a miniſter for whom he had great affection, and in whom he repoſed an unlimited confidence, it afterwards became a matter of more indifference to him by whom he was ſerved in the affairs of his government.</p>
                        <p>He was merciful in his diſpoſition, but not to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as in any ſort to encourage offences againſt his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. On the ſuppreſſion of the rebellion in 1746, he behaved without any remarkable diſplay either of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or clemency. Many were pardoned, many puniſhed; and this perhaps, is the moſt proper conduct on ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, where offended majeſty requires victims, juſtice examples, and humanity pardons. But though the law in many inſtances had its free courſe, the exceſſes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the rage of war, were by him neither commanded nor approved. After that rebellion had been ſuppreſſed, he retained no bitter remembrance of it, either to the country in which it unfortunately began, or even to many of the perſons who were actually concerned in it.</p>
                        <p>As he came into England in a riper age, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence never had been able to attain a perfect knowledge of the force and beauties of our language, he never ſhewed a ſufficient regard to the Engliſh literature, which in his reign did not flouriſh: and this muſt be conſidered as the

For theſe two ſo very different ſituations, very different and almoſt oppoſite tempers and talents have been always thought neceſſary. But that king had a mind per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:1261701201:359"/>
adapted to both; for whilſt in England he kept the liberties of his people inviolate, and like a wiſe magiſtrate, was ſatisfied to make his authority co-operate with law, and his will freely ſubſervient to the wiſdom of ages, in Hanover like an indulgent father, acting only from the ſentiments of a paternal heart, his affection and his equity ſupplied the want of law and conſtitution. He has indeed left to his illuſtrious ſucceſſor, an admirable example; which he not only promiſes to follow, but in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to exceed; and his ſubjects take the greater intereſt in his virtues, as they look upon them as more peculiarly their own; and they now boaſt of a prince, who neither has, nor can have any partiality but the beſt, and who is in birth as well as inclination Britiſh.</p>

 he in the moſt public and ſolemn manner confirmed the hopes of his allies, and gave the moſt undoubted aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his reſolution to continue the war on the former plan, and with the former vigour; and he found his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament no ways changed in their reſolution of ſupporting it with the ſame liberality and ſpirit.

                        <p>Berlin is compoſed of five towns, which have ſtretched to each other and grown into one vaſt city upon the banks of the river Spree. It has been augmented to this gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, by having long been the reſidence of the electors of Brandenburg and kings of Pruſſia, who as they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:1261701201:361"/>
their dominions by inheritance, force, or policy, have all contributed ſomething to the grandeur and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of this their capital. The ſituation of the town on ſo noble and navigable a river as the Spree, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating on one ſide with the Oder, by a canal (the moſt princely work of her ſovereigns) and on the other falling into the Elbe, has added not a little to its extent and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; but that which has contributed moſt of all, has been the reception of the French refugees, to which this city has always been a moſt aſſured and favourable aſylum, as it has alſo been to thoſe proteſtants who have been perſecuted in any part of Germany; and the preſent king by enlarging his plan, and imparting an extent of toleration unknown to his predeceſſors, has alſo introduced Roman Catholics, whom he has encouraged by ſuffering them to build a moſt magnificent church in the heart of Berlin. By this means he has brought the moſt oppoſite factions to concur in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the grandeur of his royal reſidence. From theſe cauſes Berlin is become one of the moſt conſiderable cities in Europe; vaſt in its extent; conſiderable in its commerce, and magnificent beyond moſt others in its public and private buildings, and the regular diſtribution of the ſtreets in the new town. It had long been the ſeat of the greateſt mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary arrangements in the world; and it was made by the preſent king the ſeat of arts and ſciences, and the place of reſort of ingenious men, in every ſcience, in every art, and from every quarter.</p>
                        <p>Such is Berlin, which at this time being deſerted by the greateſt part of its garriſon, was abandoned to the mercy of a mighty army of Auſtrians, Ruſſians, Saxons and Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, animated by revenge; exaſperated by injuries; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated by avarice. Nothing could exceed the terror and conſternation of the inhabitants on this occaſion. They were acquainted with the ſavage character of one part of the enemy, and with the violent animoſity of the reſt; and they knew that they did not want pretences for colouring their ſeverities, with the appearance of a juſt retaliation.</p>
                        <p>In theſe diſpoſitions of the inhabitants, the enemy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poached. The garriſon immediately propoſed to capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. With reſpect to them, the terms were ſhort; they were made priſoners of war. But with regard to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, where the great danger lay, the conditions were more tolerable than they expected; they were promiſed

encamped within reach of Torgau, one part of his army extending to the Elbe, by which he was covered on that ſide, and whilſt he was protected on every other quarter by ponds, hills, and woods, it was impoſſible to chuſe a more advantageous ſituation, in which above 80,000 men were poſted with every precaution that could be taken by a weak army in the moſt unlucky poſition.</p>
                        <p>The King of Pruſſia was extremely ſenſible of the ſtrength, the advantageous poſture, and the precautions of M. Daun; he could have no hope of drawing that wary commander from his poſt; and yet he ſaw a neceſſity of fighting him even there. The winter was now far advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. His troops were extremely harraſſed by ſuch long and rapid marches: and he had no place for their winter-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters but his own country; already waſted by the enemies incurſions: and here ſtreightened for ſubſiſtence, cut off from all power of recruiting, he was to expect to be attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it were, in a narrow corner by the combined force of ſo many powerful and exaſperated enemies.</p>
                        <p>In theſe circumſtances he was reſolved to come to a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. He cauſed his army to be informed that he was to lead them to a moſt deſperate attempt, that his affairs required it, and that he was determined to conquer or die in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected engagement. They unanimouſly anſwered, that they would die along with him.</p>
                        <p>Animated by this declaration he began his march;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3d Nov."/> 

 but having taken a reſolution as daring as could be dictated by deſpair, he made all the diſpoſitions with as much ſkill and care as could be ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the moſt guarded prudence. He divided his army into three columns; General Hulſen with one was to take poſt in a wood that lay on the left of the Auſtrian army, and had orders not to move until he found the reſt of the Pruſſians engaged. General Ziethen was to charge on the right; the great attack in front was to be made by the king in perſon. The king had diſpoſed his force in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that either his right or left muſt take the enemy in rear and cloſe them in, ſo as to diſable them from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking any thing againſt the part where he intended to effect his principal attack.

vain to think of diſpoſſeſſing them, ordered a retreat, which was conducted in this darkneſs and acroſs the Elbe with wonderful order; none were loſt in paſſing the bridges, and far the greater part of their artillery was preſerved. The Pruſſians remained maſters of this well-fought and bloody field. The darkneſs hindered them from moleſting the enemies retreat or improving their victory, which they bought at the expence of ten thouſand killed and wounded, and about three thouſand priſoners. But even with this loſs, the advantage was well purchaſed: it was a neceſſary and a glorious victory. It re-eſtabliſhed the reputation of their arms; it ſecured their winter-quarters; and gave them again the poſſeſſion of a great part of Saxony.</p>
                        <p>Probably of all the King of Pruſſia's battles, this was the moſt important; and it was that in the conduct of which he ſhewed the greateſt ſkill, intrepidity, and perſeverance. His troops behaved with a firmneſs which would have done honour to thoſe which he formerly led into Bohemia. In this action where they were to ſurmount every obſtacle and encounter every difficulty and danger in order to attack ſo great and excellent an army as the Auſtrian, under ſuch an accompliſhed commander as M. Daun, their number did not exceed fifty thouſand men.</p>
                        <p>The loſs of the Auſtrians was very great; the number killed and wounded is not indeed accurately known. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably it did not much, if at all exceed the loſs on the ſide of the victorious army; but the priſoners were far more numerous, two hundred and ſixteen officers of the Auſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were taken, among whom were four generals, together with eight thouſand of the common ſort. The king in this battle, in which he every moment expoſed his life to the greateſt dangers, received a ſlight contuſion in his breaſt by a muſket ſhot.</p>
                        <p>The Auſtrians diſputed the victory in the Gazettes. But the King of Pruſſia reaped all the fruits of it; he recovered all Saxony except Dreſden; it had been the extremity of raſhneſs to have commenced the ſiege of that place in the depth of winter, and in the ſight of an army ſtrongly poſted, and which though it had been beaten continued after its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, more numerous than his own.

of the enſuing year, two millions of crowns, excluſive of the ordinary revenue, together with a vaſt quantity of forage and proviſion. From all the other parts of Miſnia which he held he exacted in the ſame proportion. He compelled them alſo to ſupply a vaſt number of recruits; his demand was twenty thouſand; and though it be certain that they could not ſupply ſo many, yet he was enabled by the recruits furniſhed by Saxony alone, entirely to fill up the breaches which the battle of Torgau had made in his battalions. He drew alſo vaſt reſources from the dutchy of Mecklenburgh, which he taxed at ſome millions of crowns, an immenſe quantity of proviſion, and a great number of recruits. Theſe he inſiſted either on receiving immediately, or that the duke ſhould enter his troops into the Pruſſian ſervice. It is ſaid that his majeſty then made ſome ſort of treaty or compoſition with the duke, whoſe condition has been from the beginuing of the war, the worſt that can be imagined. For his ſituation is ſuch, juſt behind the Pruſſian dominions, and out of all poſſibility of communication with the grand armies of his allies, that he cannot be benefited by any advantages which they acquire; on the contrary, he ſuffers almoſt equally, whether the King of Pruſſia be vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious or defeated; and his dominions muſt furniſh the means of improving the king's victories, and repairing his loſſes. If the King of Pruſſia has made a treaty with this Prince, there is no doubt that it is almoſt wholly in his majeſty's favour, and that he has taken care that he ſhall not draw much leſs profit from the Duke of Mecklenburgh as an ally, than he had derived from him as an enemy.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, with regard to extent of poſſeſſion, the King of Pruſſia is much in the ſame ſituation in which he was left at the cloſing the foregoing campaign; but in all other reſpects his condition is infinitely preferable. He had then indeed the ſame poſſeſſions in Saxony; but he cloſed that campaign with the loſs of two battles, deſtructive in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and diſgraceful in their circumſtances: he cloſed this by a moſt beneficial and moſt glorious victory, by which the reputation of his arms, greatly tarniſhed, was reſtored to its former brightneſs, and which in its conſequences has given him as fair a proſpect of ſucceſs as he can have, whilſt the alliance againſt him is not in the leaſt degree weakened by the falling off of the moſt inconſiderable member, or the abatement of the ſmalleſt degree Of their animoſity.</p>

deeper into the inextricable toils of a German war, in which we waſte our ſtrength only to entangle ourſelves further. She holds the ſtrings, and can never be tired out at this game. From all this ariſes an expence unknown even in thought to our forefathers, and which the ſingle revenue of England is by no means able to bear. The allies, if they deſerve the name, ſupply not the ſmalleſt part of it. The Hanoverians and Heſſians contribute to our ſervice only by enabling us to protract ſtill longer our efforts in a ſyſtem, in which nothing can ſo effectually ſerve us as being defeated as early as poſſible.</p>
                        <p>As to the King of Pruſſia, what we pay to that monarch, may rather be conſidered as tribute than ſubſidy; ſince we receive nothing in return: and that far from being able to afford any relief to our armies, he is ſcarcely in a condition to ſupport himſelf. So that this alliance is worſe than the former, as it is an heavy charge compenſated not only with no real, but even with no apparent or ſhewy advantage. Indeed, he is an ally the laſt in the world we ought to have choſen, on account of his long connection with our worſt enemies, the mean and the hoſtile ſentiments he has always entertained towards us, the injuries he has done us, and the general lightneſs of his faith with regard to his former allies. We regard him, it is true, as the protector of the Proteſtant religion; but how lightly he thinks of all religion his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings teſtify; and what miſchiefs he has done the Proteſtant cauſe in particular, this war will be a laſting memorial. When he entered Saxony, a Proteſtant country, he found that religion no ways moleſted in thoſe places, where it had been eſtabliſhed or tolerated by the treaty of Weſtphalia. Even in the Popiſh dominions the perſecution began to loſe ſomething of its edge, when he under the name of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, brought upon it as great a calamity as its moſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined enemies could have wiſhed; by dividing the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtates of the empire, and ſetting Proteſtants to cut the throats of Proteſtants, whilſt all the Popiſh powers have been forced into a ſtrict confederacy,</p>

                        <p>On the other hand, the account ſtands thus with regard to England; deeply embarked as ſhe has been in this Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man war, in her particular quarrel with France, ſhe has been carried along with an almoſt uninterrupted tide of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. She has taken many of the French colonies; ſhe has deſtroyed their navy and their trade, and having inſulted the enemies coaſts, has ruined an harbour which might one day prove very obnoxious to us. Then how ſtands the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in Germany? The French have been there frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defeated: Hanover has been recovered and protected: The King of Pruſſia has been preſerved ſo long at leaſt from the rage of his enemies, and in general the liberty of Germany has been hitherto ſecured. So that if we have incurred a great expence, we have done by it infinitely more than France has done at an expence much greater than ours. For the advocates who declaim againſt the King of Pruſſia, ſeem to have forgot that the charge of the French army muſt exceed ours, as the number of their troops to be paid, exceeds the difference between French and Engliſh pay. Thoſe on the Engliſh eſtabliſhment in Germany, have at no time exceeded 25,000, and the reſt of the confederates ſerve very nearly on the ſame terms with the French. Not to mention the ſubſidies ſo greatly ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to ours, which that power pays to ſtates from whom ſhe has not a ſingle regiment to augment her armies. Thus, although by our victories, France is relieved from the charge of her navy, and that of the defence of ſome of her moſt conſiderable colonies, the German war alone has brought her finances to a diſtreſs of which the whole world has been witneſs. And nothing leſs could have happened; the expence however contracted was ſtill enormous; and the reſource of every war, trade was almoſt wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. In England, the expence was alſo undoubtedly great: but then, the old trade ſtill remained to ſupply it, and new channels were opened. Had we lain by and tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beheld Germany in part poſſeſſed, and the reſt compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to receive laws from France, the war there would ſoon have been brought to an end; and France ſtrengthened by victory, by conqueſt and alliance, would have the whole force and whole revenue of her mighty monarchy free to act againſt us alone.</p>

year, than the events which we have juſt related. But to avoid breaking the thread of the more important events in Germany, we have reſerved it for this place.</p>
                        <p>The reader will remember, that in the French ſcheme for invading theſe iſlands, (which was deſcribed as it then appeared to us in the 4th chapter of the annals of 1759,) a ſmall ſquadron was prepared at Dunkirk, under Monſieur Thurot, the deſtination of which moſt people at that time imagined to have been for Scotland. But, it has ſince ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that this little ſquadron was intended to make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion on the north coaſt of Ireland, whilſt the grand fleet under Monſieur de Conflans, made the principal deſcent in ſome of the ſouthern parts of that kingdom. The manner in which the latter and principal part of this project failed, has already been related among the tranſactions of that year. It remains now to give ſome account of the part in which Thurot was concerned.</p>
                        <p>His ſquadron, conſiſting of five frigates, on board of which were 1270 land ſoldiers, ſailed from the port of Dunkirk on the 5th of October 1759. They had been blocked up until that time by an Engliſh fleet; but under favour of an hazy night, they put out to ſea, and arrived at Gottenburg in Sweden ten days after. From thence they made to Bergen in Norway. In theſe voyages, the men were reduced by ſickneſs, and the veſſels themſelves had ſo ſuffered by ſtorms, that they were obliged to ſend one of the moſt conſiderable of them back to France. It was not until the 5th of December, that they were able to ſail directly for their place of deſtination. But their old ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune purſued them with freſh diſappointments. For near three months they beat backward and forward amongſt the weſtern iſles of Scotland, having in vain attempted a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient landing near Derry. In this tedious interval they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered every poſſible hardſhip. Their men were thinned and diſheartened. Another of their ſhips was ſeparated from them, of which they never heard more. The now remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three were extremely ſhattered, and their crews ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed extremely by famine. This obliged them to put into the iſle of Ilay;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Feb. 16."/> 

 where they refitted and took in ſome cattle and proviſions, which were liberally paid for by the generous adventurer who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and who behaved in all reſpects with his uſual courteſy and humanity.</p>

frigates which happened to be in the harbour of Kinſale, when Thurot made his deſcent; the duke of Bedford, lord lieutenant, diſpatched orders to the commander of the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates to go in queſt of the French armament. The Engliſh frigates were one of 36 guns commanded by Capt. Elliott; and two of 32.</p>
                        <p>Such was their diligence and ſucceſs, that they overtook Thurot's ſquadron before they could get out of the Iriſh ſea. They were exactly three frigates to three. The French ſhips were much the larger, and their men much more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous; but both ſhips and men were in a bad condition. A ſharp and cloſe engagement began. None of the French could poſſibly eſcape, and they muſt take or be taken. Thurot did all that could be expected from the intrepidity of his character; he fought his ſhip until ſhe had her hold almoſt filled with water, and her decks covered with dead bodies. At length he was killed. The crew of his ſhip, and by her example thoſe of the other two, diſpirited by this blow, and preſſed with uncommon alacrity by the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal bravery of Capt. Elliott, and thoſe who commanded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, ſtruck, and were carried into Ramſay Bay in the Iſle of Man. Even this inconſiderable action added to the glory of the Engliſh arms. None had been better conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or fought with greater reſolution. This ſole inſult on our coaſts was ſeverely puniſhed; and not a veſſel concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it eſcaped. The public indeed lamented the death of the brave Thurot, who even whilſt he commanded a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer, fought leſs for plunder than honour; whoſe behaviour was on all occaſions full of humanity and generoſity; and whoſe undaunted courage raiſed him to rank, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited diſtinction. His death ſecured the glory he always ſought: he did not live to be brought a priſoner into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland; or to hear in France thoſe malignant criticiſms, which ſo often attend unfortunate bravery.

                        <p>The imminent danger of two Engliſh garriſons, and that whole tract of her colonies, being made known to General Amherſt, he detached Colonel Montgomery to their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, with a regiment of Highlanders, a battalion of the Royal Americans, a body of grenadiers, and the provincial troops. He marched into the enemies country. He made war upon the Indians after their own manner. No other would have been effectual.

 But here our army was obliged to retire, with a loſs of between 3 and 400 killed and wounded.</p>
                        <p>Gen. Lally animated with this and ſome ſlighter advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, threatened the ſiege of Trichenopoly, and the French affairs ſeemed again to revive. But it was only a momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gleam. To check his progreſs, Col.

 he obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the garriſon to march out.</p>
                        <p>This progreſs alarmed Gen. Lally; he called large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments in from every ſide; and knowing the importance of Wandewaſh, made all his efforts to recover it. He puſhed forward the ſiege with the utmoſt vigour; hoping to take the town before Col. Coote could arrive to its relief. But the Colonel marched with equal diligence and arrived about the time when the French had made a practicable breach.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 22,"/> 

 His army conſiſted of 1700 Europeans, and about 3000 black troops. Lally's amounted to 2200 Europeans, and between 9 and 10,000 blacks. The engagement was long and obſtinate; but at length, the French gave way. It was a total rout; they abandoned their camp, their cannon, and all the imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſiege. They left 1000 killed and wounded on the field of battle. Among the priſoners were Brig. Gen. Buſſy; the Chevalier Godeville, quarter-maſter general; Lieut. Col.

Gen. <hi>Buſſy</hi> was arrived at <hi>Arcot</hi> from the northward, with 300 <hi>Europeans,</hi> and a large black army, and that the army, which lay at <hi>Chittiput,</hi> was to join him, and that the force from the ſouthward were on their march towards <hi>Arcot,</hi> I therefore thought it adviſeable to croſs the <hi>Palla,</hi> and encamp the army oppoſite the <hi>Arcot,</hi> having the <hi>Palla</hi> between us. Three thouſand <hi>Moratta</hi> horſe about this time joined the enemy, which put me to the greateſt diſtreſs for want of proviſions, as they plundered all the country. On the 27th, Lieut. Gen. <hi>Lally</hi> arrived at <hi>Arcot,</hi> and took the command. <hi>January</hi> the 9th, the enemy were all in motion. On the 10th, Gen. <hi>Lally</hi> marched with all his army towards <hi>Wondiwaſh,</hi> and I moved with our army along the bank of the river, in order to obſerve their motions, and cover our own country. On the 12th, I received a letter from the commanding officer at <hi>Conjeveram,</hi> that 500 of the enemy's <hi>Europeans,</hi> and a large body of horſe, had entered the town; and that the reſt of their army lay at <hi>Jango<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,</hi> three miles diſtance from it: I therefore put the army in motion, and endeavoured, by a forced march, to ſave that place, which was very weak (but of conſequence to us) and happily ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there the 13th before day-light. The enemy quitted the place, their army moved towards <hi>Wondiwaſh.</hi> The 15th I croſſed the <hi>Palla</hi> with all the army, and on the 17th arrived at <hi>Outrema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,</hi> about fourteen miles from <hi>Wondiwaſh,</hi> which place I found M. <hi>Lally</hi> had inveſted, and began to raiſe batteries. The 21ſt, I went with all the cavalry to reconnoitre, having received a letter from the commanding officer of the garriſon, that a breach was made; I therefore determined to engage the enemy the next morning. Accordingly, I ſent orders back to the army to join me at <hi>Irimborough,</hi> nine miles from <hi>Wondiwaſh,</hi> where I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken poſt with the cavalry. On the 22d, the army marched, at ſix o'clock in the morning, agreeable to the orders I had given out the day before for that purpoſe. About 7 o'clock, our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced guard of horſe, and that of the enemy, began to fire at each other; upon which I ordered Captain Baron <hi>de Vaſſerot,</hi> who commanded the cavalry, to form them in order of battle; he was ſupported by five companies of <hi>Seapoys;</hi> and, at the ſame time I ordered up two pieces of cannon, and advancing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

is concluded on other terms, as the King of Pruſſia has found by ſevere experience, and as we obſerved on a form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er occaſion, is only a ſhort ceſſation, and not a perfect peace. But it muſt be acknowledged that this ſituation, the moſt coincident with their true intereſt, is at the ſame time the moſt contradictory to the paſſions and prejudices of nations. It appears hard to looſe upon every ſide every object of the war. A peace on this foundation will be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, but it is the beſt, on the ſame principle that the ſhorteſt follies are the beſt; and that no injured pride is left to brood over a future war. Contrary to the opinion of the warm patriots on all ſides, we therefore imagined that the year ſeventeen hundred and fifty-eight, in the cloſe of the third campaign, was the happy moment for negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At this time, however, no propoſitions had been made. The propoſitions of ſeventeen hundred and fifty-nine were but ſlightly regarded, and obviouſly could end in nothing. But in the beginning of the year, of which we are now going to treat, the ſcene of negociation was opened with far greater ſolemnity and parade; and as it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with great diligence, it neceſſarily makes a principal part of the hiſtory of this year. It is indeed ſomewhat for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate both for the writers and the readers of theſe events that this treaty has intervened. The narative otherwiſe had proved extremely barren and unentertaining. For though the animoſity of the belligerent powers was not, as we obſerved, abated, their efforts, however, had conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ſlackened, and their operations began gradually to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into the Petiteguerre. Thoſe vaſt events that aſtoniſh the mind, or hold it in a pleaſing ſuſpence; thoſe important battles and ſieges; thoſe rapid and well conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed marches, and thoſe lively enterprizes which diſtinguiſh the former years, except in a very few inſtances, ſcarce make any part of the hiſtory before us. But though the operations of the field had fallen into a ſtate of langour, the cabinet became full of buſineſs, and negociation flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. In this ſituation candour obliges us to acquaint our readers that we are ſtill more liable to miſtakes, than when we attempt to deſcribe the tranſactions of the campaign. It very frequently happens, that the accounts of the military operations come authenticated from the hands of thoſe great generals who have conducted them, and when we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for the partiality of the account, there is nothing to
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:1261701201:405"/>
be detracted from them for want of ſufficient information. Even in the caſe of partiality, we are often able to correc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> the miſrepreſentation or over-charge of one of the parties by that of the other. Theſe things are done in the eye of the world. But the motives either to peace or war, and the ſteps taken in a negociation, are all behind the curtain. They do not appear for a long time, and, ſometimes they never appear completely. There is however, an advantage in the preſent conjuncture. For one of the powers at war, in order to juſtify to its ſubjects and to the world, its part in the continuance of a war ſo fatal to both, has publiſhed an account of the late negociation; artful indeed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably in ſome reſpects unfair; but containing at the ſame time many valuable and illuſtrating pieces, the authenticity of which is not diſputed. The point in ſuch caſes to be dreaded is not the publication of falſe pieces but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment of ſeveral that are real and important. The public information is probably rather incompleat, than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true. We wait with impatience for that full and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic narrative of ſo important a negociation, which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly our court propoſes to publiſh. We have delayed the ſetting out our work the longer, in hopes of its appearance, by which we might have been able to perfect and correct our account of this tranſaction. The account of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh negotiation has appeared late, but we have not failed to make uſe of it. At preſent we engage in our work, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe difficulties, which it is juſt the reader ſhould know and allow for. In the ſucceeding year we ſhall take care to profit of whatever further lights may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
                        <p>Very early in this year 1761, the courts of Peterſburgh, Vienna, France, Sweden and Poland, agreed ſeverally and jointly to offer propoſals towards renewing that negotiation for peace, which had abruptly been broken off in the cloſe of the year 1759. France was the principal and firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; for as it was her ambition which had made the war ſo general, and her revenue which in a great meaſure ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it; the former being now humbled by a ſeries of unfortunate events, and the latter reduced by moſt enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous expences, ſhe began at length to relent, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to deſire peace in earneſt. The other members of the grand alliance could not decently, nor ſafely oppoſe theſe diſpoſitions of France. The court of Sweden in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:1261701201:406"/>
was given to underſtand, that the exhauſted condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of France was the true motive of her moderation; that in fact, ſhe was not able any longer to furniſh the ſtipulated ſubſidies, nor to adhere to the letter of her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements with her allies. Theſe circumſtances, which ſhe was neither able, nor ſeemed diſpoſed to conceal, formed the ſureſt guaranty of her ſincerity.</p>
                        <p>The five parties to the war on that ſide, made as many declarations, which were ſigned at Paris on the 25th of March, and delivered at London on the 31ſt of the ſame month. The counter declaration of Great Britain and Pruſſia appeared on the 3d of April. Augſburg, as the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation moſt commodious for the powers at war, was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the congreſs.</p>
                        <p>Lord Egremont, Lord Stormont ambaſſador in Poland, and general Yorke our ambaſſador in Holland, were nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated as the Engliſh plenipotentiaries. On the part of France, the count de Choiſel was appointed. Augſburg now became the centre of attention to all Europe, and each court prepared every thing towards this important meeting which it could furniſh of ſplendor for the diſplay of its dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and of ability for the ſupport of its intereſt. The public converſation was for a while diverted from ſcenes of horror, bloodſhed, and pillage; and every mind was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed more agreeably on the public ſcene of magnificence, and the private game of policy, which was to enſue.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt place, it was unanimouſly agreed, in order that a negotiation, in itſelf ſufficiently intricate, ſhould be the leſs embarraſſed, to admit to the treaty none but the parties principally concerned, together with their allies.</p>
                        <p>Although this excluſion of the neutral intereſts tended greatly to diſembarreſs and ſimplify the negotiation, yet ſuch was the variety of ſeparate and independent matters, which ſtill remained to be diſcuſſed, that it became adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to make a further ſeparation, if they hoped to treat upon them with any tolerable eaſe, or with any proſpect of coming to a ſpeedy deciſion.</p>
                        <p>For this purpoſe it was neceſſary to bring back the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to the war to their firſt principles; and to diſengage thoſe ſeveral intereſts which originally, and in their own nature had no connection, from that maſs, in which mutual injuries and a common animoſity had blended and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded them.

                           <pb n="358" facs="tcp:1261701201:409"/>

                        <p>The war, which was truly and originally German, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently had but a ſingle, though this a very difficult object to determine the fate of the King of Pruſſia. So many powers were concerned in this determination, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           </gap> various and difficult to be reconciled, that this alone ſeemed matter enough for a ſeparate and very arduous negotiation. In effect all the powers of the north were concerned in it. For this reaſon, the other great object of the general war, the limits of America, which by that ſtrange chain of hoſtile connections, which even unites the various inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent quarrels and enmities of Europe, had been mixed with the German diſputes, was again ſet upon its proper and peculiar baſis; and whilſt the truly German intereſts were handled at Augſburg, it was propoſed to treat on this head ſeparately in London and in Paris. For this purpoſe, miniſters were mutually ſent from thoſe courts; Mr. Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley on the part of England; and Mr. Buſſy on that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> France.</p>
                        <p>This propoſition was alſo exceedingly prudent; for there is no doubt that if theſe potentates could ſettle their claims to their mutual ſatisfaction, and ſhould carry to Augſburg the ſame candour and good faith, and the ſame ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of peace, their influence muſt neceſſarily tend to inſpire principles of moderation into the reſt, and muſt contribute largely to accelerate the great work of pacification.</p>
                        <p>Things were thus ſet upon the beſt footing poſſible, and the negotiation ſeemed to be in the happieſt train that could be wiſhed. But unfortunately the plan and diſpoſition of the treaty were much more eaſily adjuſted, than the matter and the ſubſtance. It was very obvious, that France if ſhe was willing even to pretend to a deſire of peace, could ſcarce avoid making conceſſions, which to her were ſufficiently mortifying. The moment her proper quarrel came to be ſeparated from the general cauſe, ſhe had every diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the negociation, becauſe ſhe had ſuffered every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter in the war. On the ſide of Germany indeed ſhe had acted with ſucceſs; but even there the advantages ſhe had acquired were ſtill precarious, as the chance of war was ſtill open: no propoſition for a ceſſation of arms having been admitted. As ſhe knew therefore, that great ſacrifices
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:1261701201:410"/>
might be expected from her, ſhe did not ſo finally reſt her hopes upon the negotiation, as not to look out for another reſource; and this rendered on her part the whole proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs effective and leſs ſincere.</p>
                        <p>The reſource ſhe ſought was in Spain, who ſhe hoped could not look with indifference on the humiliation of the principal branch of the houſe of Bourbon. Hitherto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the king of Spain had obſerved a tolerable exact neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality in his conduct, and in his declarations had ſpared no expreſſions of good will and friendſhip to our court. He ſeemed to be wholly intent on the internal oeconomy of his dominions, on the improvement of their long neglected police, on the advancement of their commerce, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of the finances. But notwithſtanding theſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic attentions, the French miniſtry did not deſpair of drawing his regards abroad. They thought that the offers which France in her preſent circumſtances would find her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to make, muſt extremely alarm all good Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, who could not ſee without the moſt ſerious apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the French power wholly annihilated in America. By this event, their colonies, though ſo much ſuperior to all others in opulence and extent, muſt in a manner be at the mercy of England: no power being in any ſort able to afford them aſſiſtance, or to hold the ballance between them and the power of England. At this time indeed, the French court had not abſolutely ſucceeded in her deſigns at Madrid: but ſhe was in hopes, that every ſtep ſhe took in the treaty and every conceſſion ſhe ſhould make, would prove a freſh incentive to the jealouſies and apprehenſions of Spain. Thus in effect all the motions which France ſeemingly made towards peace were in reality ſo many ſteps towards a new war; and whilſt at London ſhe breathed nothing but moderation, and the moſt earneſt deſire of putting a period to the calamities of Europe, at Madrid ſhe was taking the moſt vigorous meaſures for ſpreading them further, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them longer.</p>
                        <p>On the ſide of England, though there was far more good faith in the public procedure, there were alſo, it muſt be admitted, many circumſtances which co-operated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the peace. The great and almoſt unparallelled ſucceſs which attended our arms in this war, had raiſed a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable expectation, and inſpired very high thoughts into the minds of the people. They thought it unreaſonable to
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:1261701201:411"/>
make almoſt any conceſſions to a nation whoſe ambition and violence they had always found to correſpond with its power, and whom they now conſidered as lying at their mercy. That this was the time for reducing France, which if we let paſs, we could never hope again to recover. In theſe ſentiments it muſt have fared ill with that adminiſtration, who ſhould make a ſacrifice of any of thoſe objects on which the people had ſet their hearts.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand it could not have eſcaped them, that the ſituation of affairs in Germany, however they might be artificially ſeparated in the diſcuſſion, muſt neceſſarily have an influence on the final determination of the treaty. They ſaw, that after a ſevere ſtruggle of five years, the affairs of our neareſt allies were only not ruined. To ſay nothing of the condition of the King of Pruſſia, the whole country of Heſſe was in the actual poſſeſſion of France; they likewiſe held the county of Hanau; and by their occupation of Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingen, the Hanoverian territory lay open to their arms. If this quarrel ſhould be conſidered as a cauſe not ſtrictly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, (though the French in their memorials contended it was), yet certainly the Heſſians, and principally the Hano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verians, were allies of ſo near a connection, and had done and ſuffered ſo much in the common cauſe, that it muſt have appeared ſhocking to all Europe, if ſolely attentive to our own peculiar advantages, we ſhould patch up a peace without any proviſion in their favour: and it was very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that this proviſion could not be made in the ſituation in which the laſt campaign had left them, unleſs our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment purchaſed it at a price that would be very grudgingly paid by the Engliſh ſubjects.</p>
                        <p>The miniſtry, perplexed between the natural expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their country, and the reaſonable expectations of their allies, muſt have found it not a little difficult to know what party they ought to take. In order to reconcile, as much as poſſible, theſe contradictory deſires, the only ſolution which could be found was to puſh the war with the utmoſt vigour; and in the mean time not to hurry the negotiation: in hopes that during its progreſs things might take ſuch a turn, as to enable them to purchaſe peace for their allies out of the acquiſitions they ſhould have made after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the treaty, and without being obliged to have recourſe to their conqueſts, previous to that aera.

faith, and at the ſame time to preſerve the reputation which was ſo neceſſary to their affairs at home. Accordingly the duke of Brunſwick was to proſecute with the utmoſt vigour, the operations which he had begun in the depth of winter; and an expedition, the object of which was then ſecret, was prepared with equal diligence in England.</p>
                        <p>In theſe equivocal diſpoſitions, and in this odd mixture of hoſtile and pacific meaſures, began the year 1761, a year more remarkable, perhaps, than any of thoſe we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto deſcribed, for events which will be radically deciſive of the future proſperity or miſery of Europe, but leſs, for thoſe matters by which the imagination of the reader is commonly affected. Having in this chapter laid down, as far as we can conjecture, the political motives for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common effort which was made in Germany, in our next chapter we ſhall give an account of the military plan of this effort, the execution and the ſucceſs of it.</p>

                        <p>AT the cloſe of the laſt campaign, the French had the entire and undiſturbed poſſeſſion of the whole territory of Heſſe: a country tolerably provided, and which contains many tenable places. Some of theſe, they had ſtrengthened with additional works; and they had amaſſed immenſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines in the moſt convenient ſituations. This was their condition in the front of their winter cantonments. On their left they had driven the allies from the Lower Rhine, where they kept a conſiderable body of troops, which ſtreightened our quarters, and checked our efforts on that ſide. On their right they poſſeſſed the town of Gottingen, in which they had placed a very ſtrong garriſon; and thus they ſhut us up on this quarter alſo, whilſt the king's German dominions lay entirely open to their enterprizes.</p>

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:1261701201:414"/>
generals the diſpoſition he had made for the motions of the whole.</p>
                        <p>The centre was led by his ſerene highneſs in perſon; it penetrated directly into Heſſe, and marching by Zierenberg and Durenberg, made its way towards Caſſel. The right and left of the army were each at a very conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from this body; but they were ſo diſpoſed as fully to co-operate in the general plan of operation, which was very extenſive. The hereditary prince commanded on the right: he marched by Stadbergen for Mengeringhauſen; and leaving the country of Heſſe to the Eaſtward, as the alarm was to be as ſudden, and as widely diffuſed as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he puſhed forward with the utmoſt expedition into the heart of the French quarters. General Sporcken com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a corps at a greater diſtance to the left, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated into Thuringia, by Duderſtadt and Heiligenſtadt. The deſign of this movement was to break the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the French with the army of the Empire, to open one for ourſelves with the Pruſſians, and to cut off all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between the grand army of the enemy, and their garriſon at Gottingen.</p>
                        <p>By this ſudden, extenſive, and vigorous attack, the French were thrown into the utmoſt conſternation: they retreated, or rather fled upon every ſide. It could ſcarcely have been imagined, that this was the ſame army which had but juſt cloſed the campaign with ſo much ſucceſs. Such has been the ſport of fortune in this war, even beyond all former examples of her caprice, that the inſtances are numerous of inferior and beaten armies, without any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent change in their circumſtances, driving the conquerors before them. So remarkable was the revolution of fortune at this time, that it is highly credible if the French had had their quarters in an open country, their army had been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally deſtroyed: but happily for them, they had very ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient means of ſecuring their retreat. For as the allies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, they were obliged to leave Caſſel and Gottingen at their backs; into the former of which the enemy had thrown a garriſon equal to a moderate army; and in the latter they had 7 or 8000 men. Beyond theſe again were Fritzlar, Ziegenhayn, and Marpurg, places of a tolerable degree of ſtrength and well garriſoned, beſides ſome other inferior poſts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="364" facs="tcp:1261701201:415"/>The hereditary prince, whoſe party was the moſt advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtruck the firſt blow, by an attempt to ſurprize Fritz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. He had received advice that it was not prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him. He accordingly took only a few battalions and no cannon, in hopes of being able to carry that place at once. But unfortunately he was deceived in his intelligence. The garriſon was prepared and reſolute, and though the hereditary prince attacked it with his uſual ſpirit, he was obliged for that time to deſiſt, and to draw off with no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable loſs.</p>
                        <p>About this time, Marpurg was attempted in the ſame manner, and with no better ſucceſs. Gen. Breidenback, an Hanoverian officer, of great bravery, experience and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, who commanded there, loſt his life in the attack. Theſe two ſevere checks at the entrance into action, did not however diſcourage either the parties that ſuffered them, or the reſt of the army. They advanced as expeditiouſly, and with more caution. Cannon and mortars were brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Fritzlar, which, after a defence that was rather made for the credit of the commander, than from any hope of ſaving the place,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Feb. 15."/> 

 ſurrendered on honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able terms. A large magazine was found here. The marquis of Granby was employed, with ſucceſs, in reducing the forts and caſtles in this neighbourhood. The allied army reſolutely advanced, and as they advanced, the French continually retired, abandoning poſt after poſt, and fell back almoſt to the Maine. They fired their magazines as they retreated; but the allies purſued with ſo much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, that they ſaved five capital ſtores; one of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained no leſs than 80,000 ſacks of meal, 50,000 ſacks of oats, and a million of rations of hay, a very ſmall part of which had been deſtroyed. Theſe were acquiſitions of the utmoſt advantage, as they wonderfully facilitated the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the army; which, as it advanced, ſtill found its ſubſiſtence; proviſion was alſo thereby made for the caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which otherwiſe, it could never have been ſupplied with in ſuch a ſeaſon, and at ſuch a vaſt diſtance from our origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal quarters.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding this ſucceſs in front, it was not here the grand object of our operations lay. Caſſel was to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. The French had in that town a garriſon of 17 batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, beſides ſome other corps, under the command of the count de Broglio; and there was no doubt, that he would
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:1261701201:416"/>
defend the place to the utmoſt. The fortifications of Caſſel are moſtly in the old manner; they conſiſt of very high, but ſtrong walls. Some works indeed had been newly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but the great hope of the enemy was in the ſtrength of the garriſon and the rigour of the ſeaſon. The ſiege of this place was not to be delayed; however it was neceſſary previouſly to clear all the adjacent country of the enemy, and to cut off the communication of the garriſon with their grand army.</p>
                        <p>Therefore when marſhal Broglio had been driven quite out off Heſſe, and had retreated towards Frankfort, prince Ferdinand ceaſed to advance; and having ordered two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the blockade of Marpurg and Ziegenhayn, which ſtill obſtinately held out, he formed that part of the army which was with him into a chain of cantonments, making a front towards the enemy which extended from the river Lahn to the river Ohm, and from the Ohm to the Fulda; thus he propoſed to watch the motions of marſhal Broglio's army, to cover the ſiege of Caſſel, and the blockades of the two fortreſſes juſt mentioned. The ſiege of Caſſel was carried on by the count of Lippe Schaumburg a ſovereign prince of the empire, reputed one of the ableſt engineers in Europe. His management of the artillery at Thornhauſen was a principal cauſe in the acquiſition of that great victory; and it was not doubted that his abilities would be exerted as effectively at Caſſel. Trenches were opened on the firſt of March. All eyes were now directed to this point; for on the ſucceſs of this ſtroke depended the whole fortune of the campaign. It was very apparent that if Caſſel and its garriſon ſhould fall into the hands of the allies, Gottingen and the inferior places muſt inevitably fall along with it; and this misfortune would be more than equivalent to the loſs of a great battle.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt the war was thus carried on in Heſſe, M. Sporck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en who commanded the detachment to the left, on the ſide of Saxony, advanced with an intrepidity equal to the reſt; he was ſoon joined by a corps of Pruſſians, and the united army loſt no time to clear the Werra and the Unſtrut of the bodies of French and Saxons which occupied the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant poſt upon theſe rivers. As theſe bodies were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly poſted and could be ſupported on one ſide by the garriſon of Gottingen, and on the other, as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed themſelves, by the army of the empire, they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:1261701201:417"/>
their ground; and this ſoon brought on a ſharp action.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Feb. 14."/> 

 The allies attacked a large body advantageouſly poſted at Langenſaltz upon the Unſtrut; the event was entirely favourable. Three whole battalions of Saxons were made priſoners by the Pruſſians; M. de Sporcken took two battalions. The enemy's loſs was computed at five thouſand men; ſeveral pieces of cannon were alſo taken, and a large magazine was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. This blow was well followed; one body of the combined army puſhed to Eiſenach and Gotha, whilſt another by forced marches got forward to Fulda; the French gave way on their right; and the army of the empire on the left; the latter fell back to Bamberg, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally abandoning a very large tract of country.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto the affairs of the allies proceeded almoſt in an uninterrupted courſe of proſperity. It was indeed a degree of proſperity altogether aſtoniſhing, and which as at firſt it could ſcarcely have been expected, ſo there was no reaſon to imagine it would have any long continuance. For the allies on the ſide of Saxony, where M. Sporcken acted, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as their activity and ſucceſs carried them forward, left the countries on their rear more and more uncovered, and expoſed, without any or with a very inſufficient defence, to the attempts of the powerful garriſon of Gottingen. The count de Vaux, who commanded that garriſon, is a very able and enterprizing officer. And he no ſooner perceived, that the allies were wholly intent upon driving their enemies from the Werra and Unſtrut, and on puſhing the advantages they had acquired to the utmoſt, then he marched out of Gottingen with a ſtrong detachment, attacked and routed as Hanoverian convoy, fell upon the town of Duderſtadt with the utmoſt violence; and though he failed in his firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, he repeated it with ſo much ſpirit, that at length he carried that town, and afterwards ſome of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable places near it. By theſe ſucceſſes he prevented M. de Sporcken's corps from returning by the way they had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and indeed abſolutely diſqualified them from acting ſeperately from their main army; to which ſoon after theſe events, they were obliged to join themſelves. This junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now became neceſſary on another account,</p>
                        <p>Marſhal Broglio towards the cloſe of the laſt campaign had been obliged, by the enterprizes of the hereditary Prince, to detach from his army in Heſſe a large body to
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:1261701201:418"/>
the lower Rhine. He now found it equally proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call this body together with further reinforcements, in order to maintain his ground in the country northward of the Maine, where he was cloſely preſſed by the allies, and which he muſt be compelled ſhamefully to relinquiſh, if Caſſel was not relieved in time. Senſible of this, with whatever difficulty, he called in his moſt diſtant poſts, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied his army, inſpired them with new ſpirits, and made them capable, by a more exact order in their diſcipline and a great ſuperiority in their numbers, of attempting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conſiderable.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the hopes of the allies, depended on the effect of their firſt impreſſion; they were obliged to attempt too many objects at the ſame time, and theſe too arduous for the number of which their army conſiſted. For it was neceſſary that they ſhould keep one army, and that no ſmall one, employed on the ſiege of Caſſel; another was occupied in the blockade of Ziegenhayn; a third was employed to the eaſtward of the Fulda; and ſtill a fourth was neceſſary to cover and ſuſtain all theſe various opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to oppoſe itſelf to the attempts of Marſhal Brog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio. It was but too plain, that when the whole of the French force was collected in one point, it could never be reſiſted by a part only of the allied army; if they ſhould attempt to draw away any of the ſeperate corps from the critical ſervice upon which it was employed, the entire pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of their labours was given up. In a word, Prince Ferdinand had three ſtrong poſts of the enemy on his rear, and their grand army now perfectly united on his front, and his ſituation, which was far from advantageous, obliged him to call in M. Sporcken's body which had effected its pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and could beſt be ſpared. However the prince kept his poſition as long as poſſible; and the ſiege was carried on with as much vigour as a winter operation, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited defence of a great garriſon ably commanded, would admit.</p>
                        <p>But Marſhal Broglio, as ſoon as he had collected his army, advanced without delay. He cauſed the troops under the hereditary prince to be attacked near the village of Stange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode, in the neighbourhood of Grunberg, where he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in front of the before-mentioned line of the allied army. The attack was made by the enemies dragoons, the very firſt ſhock of which broke the whole foot, conſiſting of
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:1261701201:419"/>
nine regiments, Hanoverians, Heſſians, and Brunſwickers. The French on this occaſion made two thouſand priſoners, and poſſeſſed themſelves of ſeveral trophies of victory; few were killed or wounded on either ſide.</p>
                        <p>After this blow the allied army could no longer think of making head againſt the French, or of maintaining their ground in Heſſe. They broke up the blockade of Ziegen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hayn; and ſoon after raiſed the ſiege of Caſſel, after twenty-ſeven days open trenches. They evacuated the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Heſſe, retired behind the Dymel, and falling back nearly to the quarters they poſſeſſed before this undertaking.</p>
                        <p>Thus ended an expedition which was carried on againſt many difficulties, with much ſpirit, and which at firſt excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great hopes. It failed indeed in ſome of its objects; but it produced its effect in the total of the operations of the year. The French, by the deſtruction or ſeizure of ſo many of their principal magazines, were for a long time diſabled from taking any advantage of their ſucceſſes in the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing campaign, or from their late victory. It was hot until the ſeaſon was a good deal advanced that they were in a condition to act. This ceſſation was not dearly bought even by the loſs we ſuſtained at Stangerode, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme hardſhips the troops had endured during the whole ſervice; for circumſtanced as both armies were at their quitting the field, without this ſeaſonable check it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we ſhould have at this day no footing in Germany. Both armies as it where by conſent lay quiet in their winter quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. During their inaction, the negotiation at London and Paris, whoſe commencement we have related in the firſt chapter, was purſued without interruption.</p>

The firſt was, <hi>that the two crowns ſhould remain in poſſeſſion of what they have conquered one from the other.</hi> The ſecond imported that, <hi>the ſituation in which they ſhall ſtand at certain periods, ſhall be the poſition to ſerve as a baſis for the treaty which may be negotiated between the two powers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As France was known to have had the worſt in the war, a propoſition of <hi>ſtatu quo,</hi> coming from her, muſt have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared an inſtance of moderation, altogether ſurprizing to our miniſters. It is certain, that had peace been concluded at that inſtant, and upon the ſole foundation of this article, England would then have poſſeſſed all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> conqueſts ſhe had made, every one of which was in a very high degree advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to her commerce and her power, and none of which could be conſidered as a ſubject of future diſcuſſion. On the other hand, France continuing in poſſeſſion of the places ſhe had conquered, would have acquired no advantage that could at all countervail the expence of keeping them; at the ſame time that ſhe would be expoſed to endleſs alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and would afford matter of the higheſt jealouſy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and diſcontent, even to her neareſt allies. This baſis being therefore ſettled, although it was evident, that the treaty could not reſt upon this baſis ſolely. England had certainly a great ſuperiority in the negotiation, and might rationally expect (when they ſhould come to talk of reſtitutions) to purchaſe the evacuation of the French con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in Germany, at a much ſmaller price than their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent magnitude might ſeem to demand. However theſe were ſtill a matter of ſo much anxiety, and the nature of the preciſe ſtipulations were ſtill ſo uncertain, that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, though it proceeded with ſtrong appearance of a deſire for peace, met with very frequent checks and delays. Both parties were indeed unanimous in the article of <hi>uti poſſidetis;</hi> than which, it muſt be admitted, there could not be a better ground to treat upon. But as the war ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and whilſt it continued might make a daily alteration in the fortune of the contracting powers, it was neceſſary
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:1261701201:421"/>
to fix upon ſome epochas to which this poſſeſſory article ſhould refer.</p>
                        <p>The French on this head propoſed, <hi>that the ſituation in which they ſhall ſtand on the</hi> firſt of September in the year 1761 <hi>in the Eaſt-Indies,</hi> on the firſt of July in the ſame year <hi>in the Weſt-Indies and in Africa, and on</hi> the firſt of May following <hi>in Europe, ſhould be the poſition, which ſhould ſerve as a baſis to the treaty which may be negotiated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two powers.</hi> They added further, that as theſe epochas might ſeem too near or too diſtant for the intereſt of Great Britain, they were extremely willing to enter into a negotiation upon that object.</p>
                        <p>The Engliſh miniſtry received this propoſition with leſs ſatisfaction than its apparent fairneſs deſerved. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely rejected the French epochas; and declared that they could not admit, without prejudice to themſelves, any other epochas than thoſe which <hi>have reference to the day of ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the treaty of peace.</hi> Had this reſolution been ſtrictly adhered to, it was evident that the negotiation was that moment at an end. For though what was aſſerted in the French memorial in reply to this declaration, <hi>(that the baſis of the propoſition of</hi> uti poſſidetis <hi>was neceſſarily connected with the particular epochas propoſed)</hi> is by no means to be admitted; it is on the other hand not eaſy to deny the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of their ſubſequent aſſertion, "that if not theſe, at leaſt <hi>ſome</hi> certain periods during the war ought to be fixed; and that the <hi>uti poſſidetis</hi> could not reaſonably have reference only to the time of ſigning the treaty of peace." For if the contrary principle was once admitted, it would become difficult to know, or even with probability to gueſs, at the nature or the value of the poſſeſſions which by ſuch an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle ſhould be mutually given away. And if theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties occurred in the ſimplicity of a poſſeſſory article, they muſt be increaſed tenfold upon every other, and muſt come to ſuch an height as to preclude all poſſibility of negotiation on things of ſo intricate a nature as exchanges and equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents. The French in their memorial inſiſted ſo ſtrongly on the propriety of eſtabliſhing theſe periods, that they threatened to recal the whole propoſition if they were not agreed to.</p>
                        <p>It muſt doubtleſs appear at firſt view ſurprizing to ſee France, whoſe actual ſituation was very indifferent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for a near period, and England, whoſe affairs were
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:1261701201:422"/>
at that time apparently in a proſperous ſituation, poſtponing the <hi>uti poſſidetis</hi> to one more remote. But the truth is, that in that particular neither party conſulted their preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. They acted wholly on foreſight. For though the Engliſh, on the 25th of March, when this propoſition was made, were carrying on the ſiege of Caſſel, and the other ſtrong places in Heſſe, and the enemy had no army in that country to oppoſe them, it was notwithſtanding evident that from the ſlow progreſs of thoſe ſieges, and from the alacrity of marſhal Broglio in collecting his troops, they muſt be ſhortly obliged to abandon the enterprize; it was evident that France muſt be reinſtated in the abſolute poſſeſſion of her former conqueſts long before the epocha of the firſt of May, the period which they fixed for Europe. Both courts were fully apprized of this. It was therefore the intereſt of France to offer and of England to reject this near period; eſpecially as the fate of the deſign on the coaſt of France was then depending, and our adminiſtration ſeemed to have conceived no mean hopes of its ſucceſs, and no ſmall opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its importance in the negotiation.</p>
                        <p>The fleet employed in this expedition ſailed from Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head on the 29th of March, and it was ſoon diſcovered that Belleiſle was the object.</p>
                        <p>Belleiſle, the largeſt of all the European iſlands belonging to the French King, is between 12 and 13 leagues in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference.</p>
                        <p>The iſland originally belonged to the earl of Cornouaille, but has been ſince yielded to the king: it contains only one little city, called Le Palais, three country towns, 103 vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, and about 5000 inhabitants,</p>
                        <p>The town of Palais takes its name from a caſtle, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the duke de Belleiſle, in its neighbourhood, which is now converted into a citadel, which is a regular and ſtrong fortification, fronting the ſea, compoſed principally of horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and is provided with two dry ditches, the one next the counterſcarp, and the other ſo contrived as to ſecure the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior fortifications. This citadel is divided from the largeſt part of the town by an inlet of the ſea, over which there is a bridge of communication; from the other part of the town; and which is moſt inhabited, it is only divided by its own fortifications, and a glacis. There are three no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal harbours in this iſland, Palais, Sauzon and Goulfard; every one of which labours under ſome capital defect, either
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:1261701201:423"/>
in being expoſed, ſhallow, or dangerous at the entrance. The only branch of trade carried on here is the curing pilchards.</p>
                        <p>From this ſtate of the iſland, poor in itſelf, capable of little improvement, and ſo ill circumſtanced in point of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, a ſort of a diſlike to the expedition began to ariſe. Several did not ſee of what conſiderable ſervice ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt could be of to England in time of peace, or of what prejudice to the enemy in time of war. They foreſaw that it could not be taken without conſiderable loſs, or kept without conſiderable expence; and on the whole they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that when exchanges came to be made, France would lay no great ſtreſs upon it. On the other hand it was urged, that though the harbours were bad, yet ſmall priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers might iſſue from thence, greatly to the moleſtation of the French coaſting trade; and that the fleet of England might ride between it and the continent in a well protected road. They imagined the poſſeſſion of this iſland, if not of great detriment to the intereſt of France, would be a grievous wound to her pride; and that thoſe circumſtances which had formerly induced her to expend money on the fortifications there, and on the apprehenſion of an invaſion to fill them with a powerful garriſon, would likewiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade her to ſet a value on the place when it came to be eſtimated in the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt they reaſoned in this manner in England, the fleet under the command of commodore Keppel, and the land forces under general Hodgſon, arrived before Belleiſle on the 7th of April, and on the 8th agreed to attempt a landing on the ſouth-eaſt of the iſland in a ſandy bay near Lochmaria point. Here the enemy were in poſſeſſion of a little fort; they had moreover entrenched themſelves on an hill exceſſively ſteep, and the foot of which was ſcraped away. The attempt was made in three places with great reſolution: a few grenadiers got on ſhore, and formed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but as they were not ſupported, they were for the greater part made priſoners. The reſt of the army, after ſeveral very brave and repeated efforts, being wholly unable to force the enemies lines, or make good their landing, were obliged to retire with loſs; what added to the diſaſter was, that ſeveral of the flat bottomed veſſels were deſtroyed or damaged in an hard gale which followed on our retiring from the ſhore. This made the proſpect of any future at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:1261701201:424"/>
more unpleaſing even than the firſt. In this attack we loſt in killed, wounded and priſoners, near five hundred men.</p>
                        <p>Neither commanders nor ſoldiers were however diſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this mortifying repulſe. They reſolved, if poſſible, not to return without effect, and then determined diligently to ſearch the whole coaſt, in order to find a place more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable for another attack. The view indeed was not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging. The iſland is naturally a fortification; and what nature had left undone to make it ſuch, had been amply ſupplied by art.</p>
                        <p>It was a long time after this firſt failure before the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would give our commanders an opportunity of a ſecond trial; however they perſiſted with the utmoſt ſteadineſs, and found at length a convenient ſituation. Not that it was a part of the coaſt leſs ſtrong than the reſt; on the contrary, they built their principal hopes on the exceſſive ſteepneſs and difficulty of the rocks, which had rendered the enemy rather leſs attentive on this quarter. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous attempt was made at a bold rocky ſhore, near the above-mentioned point of Lockmaria. Beſides the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple attack, two feints were made at the ſame time to diſtract the enemy, whilſt the men of war directed their fire with great judgment and effect on the hills. Theſe manoeuvres gave brigadier general Lambert with an handful of men, an opportunity of climbing up a very ſteep rock, without moleſtation. This little body having thus proſperouſly gained the top of the hill, formed themſelves in good order, and without delay.

 They were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately attacked by three hundred of the French, but they maintained their advantage with reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution until the whole corps of brigadier Lambert, which now had aſcended in the ſame manner, arrived to their aſſiſtance, and repulſed the enemy

                                    <p>I Have the honour to acquaint you, that his Majeſty's fleet under the command of Com. <hi>Keppel,</hi> and the tranſports with his Mjeſty's forces on board, came to an anchor in this road on <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the 7th inſt. about twelve o'clock. Soon after their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, I went with the Commodore to take a view of the coaſt; and we agreed at our return, that the port of St. <hi>Andro</hi> appeared to us to be the beſt place to make a deſcent; and it was ſettled, that Sir <hi>Thomas Stanhope,</hi> with ſome of his Majeſty's ſhips, and the tranſports, with <hi>Stuart</hi>'s and <hi>Gray</hi>'s battalions and marines on board, ſhould make a feint at <hi>Sauzon,</hi> at the ſame time that we made a real attack at St. <hi>Andro.</hi> Then it was too late in the day to do more than give the neceſſary orders for the troops deſtined to land firſt, to be ready to embark early in the morning in the flat bottomed boats, that I might attempt a landing as ſoon as the ſhips had ſilenced a four gun-battery, which commanded the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the bay. This was ſoon done by the <hi>Achilles,</hi> after ſhe took her ſtation. No time was then loſt to go in with the boats, with the grenadiers, and the regiments ordered for this ſervice. But when we entered the bay, we found the enemy ſo ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched on each ſide of the hill, which was exceſſively ſteep, and the foot of it ſcraped away, that it was impoſſible to get up to the breaſtwork. After ſeveral unſucceſful efforts, ſeeing it was impracticable to force the enemy from their lines, I thought it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable to deſiſt. Maj. Gen. <hi>Crawford</hi> and Brig. <hi>Carleton</hi> exerted themſelves as much as poſſible on the occaſion: the latter is wounded in the thigh, but in a good way of doing well. The loſs we ſuffered in our retreat was very inconſiderable, as the fire of the ſhips covered it. The weather has been ſo bad ever ſince the 8th, that I have not been able to get returns from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral corps, ſo I cannot aſcertain our loſs; but I believe there are near 500 killed, wounded, and priſoners. I ſhall deſire Mr. <hi>Keppel</hi> to go along with me to reconnoitre the iſland once more, and if we can diſcover any part whereon an attempt can be made with the leaſt probability of ſucceſs, we ſhall make a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond trial. I cannot help obſerving to you, that the whole iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and is a fortification; and that the little nature had left undone, to make it ſuch, has been amply ſupplied by art; the enemy having been at work upon it ever ſince Sir <hi>Edward Hawke</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before it laſt winter.</p>
                                    <p>I have the honour to inform you, the greateſt harmony has ſubſiſted between the two ſervices; and I ſhould not do juſtice to the commander and officers of his Majeſty's fleet, if I did not at the ſame time I inform you, that they have aſſiſted me to the utmoſt of my wiſhes in carrying on the operations, purſuant to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's inſtructions.</p>

                                    <p>I Had the honour of writing to you the 29th of <hi>March,</hi> when I left <hi>Spithead.</hi> It was from that time to the 6th inſt. before the wind came to the weſtward, to enable the fleet to ſteer in with the coaſt of <hi>France;</hi> and that evening I detached ſix frigates, in hopes they might in the night get ſo ſtationed, as to cut off the enemy's communication with the main land. The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fleet paſſed the ſouth end of <hi>Belleiſle,</hi> cloſe along the ſhore; and at one of the bays by Point <hi>Lomaria,</hi> the General and myſelf thought a deſcent might be tried: but as the wind was ſoutherly, it could not poſſibly be attempted at that time. At twelve o'clock the whole fleet anchored in the great road; when imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately I went with Gen. <hi>Hodgſon</hi> to the northern part of the iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and, to be as well informed of the ſtrength of the enemy's works there as the time would admit; and while we were upon this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſervice, the ſhips of war in the road were preparing the flat boats for the reception of the troops; but by the time we got back, it was too late in the day to make any trial.</p>
                                    <p>The 8th the wind north-eaſterly, the boats being ready for the reception of the troops, the ſignal was made very early in the morning for them to aſſemble at the rendezvous; and three ſhips, with two bomb-veſſels, were ordered to proceed round the point of <hi>Lomaria,</hi> at the S. E. part of the iſland, and attack the fort and other works in the <hi>Sandy Bay</hi> round the before-mentioned point, the place the General and myſelf had agreed to have attacked,</p>
                                    <p>Capt. <hi>Barrington,</hi> in the <hi>Achilles,</hi> got placed firſt, and ſoon ſilenced the fire from the fort and from the ſhore; and then, as he was directed, made the ſignal of his having done ſo; when the troops in the boats were puſhed to the landing, with great briſkneſs and ſpirited behaviour, at three different places near to each other, by Capt. <hi>Barton,</hi> whom I ordered to command the boats. But the difficulty of getting footing, and the enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrongly intrenched on the heights, and in the little fort, the troops ſoon met with ſuch a repulſe, that it became neceſſary, as well as prudent, to deſiſt from the attempt for the preſent, and retire with the flat boats; in which they were well covered by the ſhips and bombs.</p>
                                    <p>One of the flat boats landed ſixty of <hi>Erskine</hi>'s grenadiers, who got up a very difficult place to the top of the hills; where they formed with great ſkill, but were ſo immediately routed by a much more numerous body of the enemy, that all attempts to ſuccour them was ineffectual, any further than the boats bringing from the rocks about twenty of them.</p>
                                    <p>While all this was tranſacting, Sir <hi>Thomas Stanhope,</hi> with four ſhips of war, the battalions of <hi>Gray</hi>'s and <hi>Stuart</hi>'s, with 500 ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines in tranſports, were oppoſite <hi>Sauzor,</hi> at the northern part of the iſland. theſe troops were embarked in the boats, if poſſible to divert the enemy from the principal object.</p>
                                    <p>A gale of wind coming on very quick after the retiring from the ſhore, has occaſioned ſo much damage among the tranſports, by the loſs of anchors and flat boats, that it takes up a very conſiderable time to put things in away to attempt what further may be thought practicable. The loſs of flat boats in the gale is twenty-two, which will render the force of landing much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to what it was firſt attempted with.</p>
                                    <p>While the repairing and adjuſting of theſe defects are in hand, I hope ſome ſpot may be agreed upon, where we may be more ſucceſsful in the attempt, than we were on the 8th; but if not ſo, I hope his Majeſty will believe I have had nothing more at heart than the exerting the force intruſted to me, in a manner moſt conducive to the honour of his arms.</p>

                                    <p>AS I have juſt had a note from Com. <hi>Keppel,</hi> to inform, me, that a frigate will ſail this day for <hi>England,</hi> I have only time to acquaint you, that his Majeſty's troops under my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand landed yeſterday at five. The enemy's attention was ſo diſtracted with our attempts of landing at different places, where there was the leaſt appearance of our being able to ſucceed, that it gave Brig. <hi>Lambert</hi> an opportunity of climbing up a rock with a corps I had left with him for that purpoſe, if practicable. The difficulty of mounting had made the enemy leaſt attentive to that part. <hi>Beauclerk's</hi> grenadiers, with their captain, <hi>Patterſon,</hi> got up before they ſaw what was intended. They immediately march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a body of 300 men to attack him. The grenadiers maintained their ground till the reſt of Brig. <hi>Lambert</hi>'s got up. We took three braſs field-pieces, and ſome wounded priſoners. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me ſufficiently to commend Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi>'s conduct and gallant behaviour on the occaſion; and take the liberty to beg you will permit me to requeſt you will recommend him to the King, as an officer deſerving his majeſty's favour. Capt. <hi>Patterſon</hi> has loſt his arm. I believe our loſs is not above thirty killed. I am afraid you will not be able to read this ſcrawl, as I write it in the field, the troops being on their march,</p>

                                    <p>I Had the honour to ſend you a letter by the <hi>Actoen</hi> frigate, in which I gave you but little hopes. Since which time the General and I having conſidered, that by attempting a place where the mounting the rocks was juſt poſſible, and where the enemy were no otherwiſe prepared, from the impracticable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance it had to them, than by a corps of troops to annoy the boats in the attempt, that it carried ſome degree of hopes with it; and by making a diſpoſition for the attack of their intrenched bays, and at <hi>Sauzon</hi> at the ſame time, which the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the tranſports with the light horſe enabled me to do, we might poſſibly gain a footing; I have now the greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in acquainting you, that his Majeſty's troops have made good a landing on the rocks near Point <hi>Lomaria;</hi> and cannot ſufficiently commend the ſpirit and good behaviour of the troops in the attempt, and the judgment with which Sir <hi>Thomas Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hope,</hi> and the reſt of the captains of the king's ſhips, directed the fire upon the hills.</p>

                           <pb n="374" facs="tcp:1261701201:425"/>The landing of all the forces was made good in a ſhort time after. The loſs in this daring and ſucceſsful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, was inconſiderable. In one or two places the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:1261701201:426"/>
ſeemed diſpoſed to make ſome ſtand; but the body of light horſe, which was embarked in this expedition, ſoon drove them to the town, and laid all quite open to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:1261701201:427"/>
before it. The great difficulty now conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in bringing forward the cannon, which were firſt to be dragged up the rocks, and afterwards, for two leagues,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:1261701201:428"/>
along a very rugged and broken road. This neceſſarily took up ſome time. However the ſiege was commenced with vigour: and the garriſon, commanded by the chevalier de
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:1261701201:429"/>
St. Croix. a brave and experienced officer, threatened on their ſide a long and obſtinate defence. Nothing in fact was deficient on either part. The enemy made ſome ſallies; one of them with conſiderable effect. Major Gen. Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford was made priſoner on this occaſion. But our troops were only animated by theſe checks. A furious attack was made upon the enemies lines which covered the town, and they were carried without much loſs; principally by the uncommon intrepidity of a company of marines which had been but newly raiſed, No action of greater ſpirit and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry had been performed during the whole war.</p>
                        <p>The town was now entirely abandoned, and the defence confined to the citadel. It was obvious, that as our fleet prevented all communication with the continent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by cut off all hopes of relief, the place muſt neceſſarily be reduced; but the chevalier de St. Croix was reſolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his own honour, when he could not for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the place entruſted to him, and, ſince he could not maintain it, to ſell it as dear a poſſible. Accordingly there was no mention of yielding, until the 7th of June, when there was no longer the ſlighteſt proſpect of ſuccour, and the place was by no means ſafely tenable. Then he capitulated, and the garriſon marched out with the honours of war.</p>
                        <p>Thus was the iſland of Belleiſle reduced under the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh government, after a defence of two months. In this expedition we had about eighteen hudred men killed and wounded. The loſs moſt regretted was, that of Sir William Peere Williams, a young gentleman of great talents and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and who had made a diſtinguiſhed figure in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. He had but newly entered into the ſervice. He was ſhot in the night, by having careleſsly approached too near a centinel of the enemy. He was the third perſon of family whom in this war, the love of enterprize had brought to an honourable death in theſe expeditions to the coaſt of France.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="379" facs="tcp:1261701201:430"/>Whatever difference of opinion might have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained concerning the value of this conqueſt, or the price which was paid for it, the rejoicing in London was great and ſincere. The general and the land and ſea offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers employed in the expedition were the ſubject of very juſt applauſe, who with ſo noble a perſeverance had ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with, and had overcome ſuch great difficulties, and who had the ſpirit, after ſuch a diſaſter on their outſet, to renew an attack under circumſtances nearly as unfavourable as thoſe by which they had been at firſt foiled. The city of London addreſſed the King on the occaſion. And it was generally expected that this new proof of our ſuperiority muſt influence the negotiation in our favour. Some how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever were of opinion, that it would rather exaſperate the French, and irritate their pride to renew theſe efforts which their misfortunes had ſlackened when they ſaw us in the midſt of a treaty making attempts, and carrying places in Old France, and as it were, in the preſence of that haughty court. However as there was nothing done that was not ſtrictly juſtifiable, no complaint was made, and the treaty proceeded, to all appearance with as much good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour as before.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>England and France agree to treat of a ſeperate peace. Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas propoſed by England. Court of Vienna agrees. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the negotiation. Propoſals of France with regard to Europe, Aſia, Africa, and America. French memorial concerning Spain. Indignation of the Engliſh miniſter. Engliſh anſwer to the French memorial.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT muſt be obſerved, that though the courts of London and Verſailles treated ſeperately, it was hitherto by no means propoſed, that this ſeperate diſcuſſion ſhould lead to a ſeperate peace. It was no more than a previous arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the removal of thoſe difficulties, which might prevent the peace of France with England from being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the general peace of Europe. But in proportion as the treaty advanced, it became obvious, that the ſettling of any terms, which had no reference to the ſignature of ſomething obligatory between the two crowns, could at beſt be only void and illuſory, and might in the end even
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:1261701201:431"/>
prove the ſource of dangerous and captious altercations. The Engliſh miniſter therefore, before he would agree to that definitively upon any point, and particularly upon the epochas, inſiſted upon two preliminary conditions.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, that every thing, which ſhould be happily adjuſted between the two crowns in relation to their particular war, ſhall be made obligatory, final, and concluſive, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the fate of the negotiation of Augſburg.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that the definitive treaty of peace between Great Britain and France, or preliminary articles to that end, ſhall be ſigned and ratified between the date of that memorial and the firſt of the following Auguſt.</p>
                        <p>If theſe conditions were accepted, then England on her part conſented to name determinate epochas, to which the <hi>uti poſſidetis</hi> ſhould refer; the firſt of July for Europe; the firſt of September for Africa and America; and the firſt of November for the Eaſt Indies. The French miniſtry without conteſting the epochas themſelves, complained of the conditions; of the firſt, becauſe they ſaid it departed from the letter and ſpirit of the memorial of the 26th of March, which was the foundation of the whole treaty; of the ſecond, on account of the extreme ſhortneſs of the time allotted for the diſcuſſion of ſome difficult and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous points; and the adjuſtment of matters which regarded a war extended over the four quarters of the globe; for the memorial which contained thoſe conditions, was dated on the 17th, and was not received at Paris until the end of June, ſo that little more than a month was left to obtain the conſent of the court of Vienna to a ſeperate treaty, to ſettle the terms of this treaty, and finally, to ratify it.</p>
                        <p>If a very uncommon good underſtanding had not ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between her imperial Majeſty and the king of France, it muſt have been very difficult to have received this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. But in fact it was immediately received, and upon one very ſhort and apparently reaſonable condition, "That nothing might be ſtipulated to the prejudice of the houſe of Auſtria." But when this condition came to be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as we ſhall ſee preſently, it was ſo far from faciliating, that it created new obſtacles to the peace. However, this acquieſcence of the principal of her allies, enabled France to accept of the firſt condition without reſerve; and to the laſt ſhe verbally, though not in the cleareſt terms, agreed alſo.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="381" facs="tcp:1261701201:432"/>Things ſeemed for the preſent in the beſt ſituation, which in this ſtage of the treaty could be expected. The baſis of the negotiation was ſolidly eſtabliſhed. The article <hi>uti poſſidetis,</hi> ſince the taking Belleiſle, was a matter of leſs difficulty, and the epochas were in general ſettled in ſuch a manner, as to coincide with the deſigns and deſires of both parties. The treaty was confined to the two powers, and it was to be perfectly definitive as to them. A time for concluding it, was alſo in a great meaſure ſettled; a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, which if it did not admit ſufficient leiſure for accurate diſcuſſion, cut off however the opportunities of chicane, and ſeemed to be the moſt ſuitable to a candid proceeding, and a ſincere deſire of peace.</p>
                        <p>The foundation being thus laid, the ſuperſtructure was the next conſideration. This ſuperſtructure conſiſted in the adjuſtment of thoſe compenſations which were to be made for the reciprocal conqueſts (and here the difficulty lay) of the two powers; a punctilio of honour might have intervened at the very firſt ſetting out, extremely pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the ſalutary work in hand; from which party the firſt propoſition ſhould proceed? But in this reſpect France gave way, and that conceſſion afforded no inconſiderable proof of her pacific intentions.</p>
                        <p>We muſt apprize the reader that we do not mean to enter exactly into the whole detail of this negotiation, nor undertake preciſely to deſcribe all the turns that were taken in it. This, we imagine, would prove a tedious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable performance. We ſhall attach ourſelves to the capital objects which were contended for in this game of policy: We ſhall endeavour to point out the matters which firſt obſtructed, and then finally broke off the treaty; and we ſhall reſt on theſe things in ſuch a manner, as ſeems to us fitteſt for marking out the true ſpirit of the negotiating powers. Our own obſervations ſhall be very ſparingly interpoſed. We are hiſtorians, and not advocates.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>uti poſſidetis</hi> being ſettled as the baſis of the treaty, nothing could reaſonably be claimed by either party, that was not to be counterpoiſed by ſome equivalent from the other; and conſequently it was neceſſary to adjuſt and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue their ſeveral poſſeſſions, pretenſions and demands. There were ſix principal objects in this negotiation. Firſt, the limits of the two crowns in North America. Secondly, the conqueſts of Great Britain in the Weſt-Indies, (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:1261701201:433"/>
with the Neutral Iſlands there.) Thirdly, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in Africa and in India. Fourthly, the adjuſtment of the particular affair between the Engliſh and French in Germany. Fifthly, the conduct which the two crowns were to hold with regard to their reſpective allies in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many. And laſtly, the reſtitution of the captures made by England, previous to the declaration of war.</p>
                        <p>On the firſt of theſe articles, France propoſed to cede and guaranty all Canada to England; ſtipulating only that the free and publick exerciſes of the Roman Catholick reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhould be permitted under the Engliſh government, and that thoſe of the old French coloniſts who choſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire might have leave to tranſport themſelves from thence, and take away or diſpoſe of their effects. In compenſation for this, they required a confirmation of the privilege <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> what fiſhing they enjoyed on the coaſt of Newfoundland, under the treaty of Utrecht; and that this fiſhery might be carried on with advantage, they likewiſe required the reſtitution of the iſle of Cape Breton, excluding themſelves in return from erecting on that iſland any kind of fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>The affairs in the Weſt-Indies, which make the ſecond capital object, they propoſed to ſettle in this manner. They offered to exchange Minorca for Guadaloupe and Marigalante; and as to the four Neutral Iſlands, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted that two of them, Dominica and St. Vincent, were held by their natural inhabitants the Carribees, under the protection of France, and that they ought ſtill to remain in the ſame condition. With regard to the two others, they propoſed to make a fair diviſion; that St. Lucia ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to France, and that England ſhould enter into poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Tobago. On this head it is ſufficient to obſerve, that in the opinion of ſome people, our miniſtry did not, in this treaty, ſet the juſt value on the acquiſition they had made; when they looked upon Canada as the great and leading object, and only conſidered Guadaloupe and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galante in a ſecondary and ſubordinate light. This is a queſtion of difficulty, and has been much agitated. Thoſe who dread a freſh American war from the ambition of France, and were ſtruck with the idea of extended empire, preferred the former conqueſt; thoſe who ſolely conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our intereſt as a commercial people, were generally in favour of the latter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="383" facs="tcp:1261701201:434"/>On the ſide of Africa, France ſatisfied herſelf with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding either the ſettlement at Senegal, or the iſle of Goree: for which (together with the reſtoration of Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſle) they conſented to evacuate Gottingen, Heſſe and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nau, and to draw off their army to the Maine and the Rhine. This was certainly a full equivalent. But with regard to the Eaſt-Indies, they had no tolerable equivalent to offer. They expatiated much in their memorial upon the diſadvantages which muſt ariſe to the companies of the two nations, from their entertaining views of conqueſt, ſo contrary to the true ſpirit, and the real intereſt of theſe trading eſtabliſhments; and they concluded by propoſing the treaty, formerly ſettled between the ſieurs Godcheau and Saunders, as a baſis for the re-eſtabliſhment of peace in Aſia. It muſt be remarked, that this treaty had been concluded at a time when the affairs of France in the Eaſt Indies made a figure very different from their preſent ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and therefore it ſeemed unfair to make this treaty a ſtandard under circumſtances altogether inapplicable.</p>
                        <p>The war, which has been ſo long, with ſo much blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and ſo fruitleſsly carried on in Weſtphalia, the French ſtrenuouſly contended, was from the time of (what they called) the breach of the capitulation of Cloſter-Seven, a war purely Engliſh; and therefore that their conqueſts in that part of Germany, formed a proper compenſation for the Engliſh conqueſts in the other quarters of the world. Our miniſters did not attempt formally to refute this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they rather ſeemed to admit it; and they agreed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly to receive the evacuation of theſe places as an equivalent for ceſſions to be made on the footing we have already mentioned. On this point there was little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
                        <p>The intricate and knotty part was on what we have ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as the fifth object; the conduct of the two crowns with regard to their allies. Here was a real, a capital difficulty. From the beginning of the negotiation, England had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that they would inviolably preſerve their faith to the King of Pruſſia, and would act ſtrenuouſly in his ſupport. This picqued the French miniſters; who, in their turn, thought themſelves bound to make a declaration equally ſtrong in favour of the empreſs; and they had, moreover, recently conditioned with the court of Vienna, to admit nothing in the treaty to her diſadvantage; words of great
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:1261701201:435"/>
latitude. However, in this difficulty, they found out a ſolution, which it muſt be confeſſed, had a very fair and captivating appearance. They propoſed that both armies in Germany ſhould obſerve an exact neutrality; and ſhould be reciprocally bound to afford no ſort of aſſiſtance, nor to give no ſort of offence to the allies of either of the parties And they propoſed further, that as armies in this ſtate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inert neutrality muſt be a dead and uſeleſs expence to the power who maintains them, the French king, from the time his Britannic majeſty recalled the Engliſh forces from Germany, would cauſe double the number of French for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the armies of the Upper and Lower Rhine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into France; and that no French troops ſhould remain in Germany but in proportion to thoſe which the king <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> England ſhould keep in his pay. It might certainly be urged in confirmation of the propriety of this offer, that is reality theſe armies, whilſt they continued in action, though they worried each other abundantly, afforded no kind of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to their allies, and therefore, when they came mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to entertain pacific ſentiments concerning their own particular quarrel, and were to give an example of modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the reſt of Europe, there ſeemed to be no reaſon why they ſhould make efforts in favour of any ally which they had not made, or been able to make in the hotteſt time of hoſtility.</p>
                        <p>The laſt article had its difficulties alſo. The French inſiſted, as a point from which they were reſolved never to recede, upon the reſtitution of the captures made before the declaration of war. This demand, they were of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was grounded on the cleareſt principles of the law of nations, and the moſt expreſs ſtipulation of treaties. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entering into theſe various arguments with which this poſition might be maintained and attacked, it appeared to many that the honour of both nations was almoſt equally concerned, the one to claim, the other as reſolutely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe this reſtitution.</p>
                        <p>On the whole, theſe propoſals, which the French ſent to London in a memorial of the 15th of July, formed, tho' in ſome reſpects undoubtedly exceptionable, a very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able plan for a treaty of peace. A better could not have been expected in the firſt project of an enemy, and it might be hoped, that a negotiation thus favourably begun, could not fail of adjuſting eaſily whatever appeared wrong, or
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:1261701201:436"/>
ſupplying whatever was defective in this firſt draught of the propoſitions. But fatally for the repoſe of mankind, in the very inſtant that this fair propoſal was made, at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment when theſe ſtrong demonſtrations were given, an act was done which blew up at one exploſion, the whole baſis of the treaty that had been long and carefully laying, ſcattered the materials which had been ſo induſtriouſly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and ſo cautiouſly arranged, and inſtead of extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, ſpread the flames of war more widely, and made them rage with new fury. From this time forward all the tranſaction was full of animoſity, reſentment and miſtruſt. The reader has been apprized of the meaſures which France had been invariably purſuing at the court of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid, and the arguments ſhe employed to infuſe a jealouſy into that court. Hitherto however, there was no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that theſe meaſures had any effect; but to the infinite ſurprize and indignation of the Britiſh miniſter, together with the memorial which contained the above recited pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, Mr. Buſſy, the French agent, delivered a private memorial, ſignifying, that in order to eſtabliſh the peace upon ſolid foundations, not to be ſhaken by the conteſted intereſts of a third power, the king of Spain might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to accede to guaranty the treaty, and that to prevent the differences which ſubſiſted between Great Britain and this monarchy from being a means of producing a freſh war in Europe, with the conſent and communication of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic majeſty, he propoſes, that in this negotiation, the three points, which had been diſputed between the crowns of England and Spain, might be finally ſettled. Firſt, the reſtitution of ſome captures made upon the Spaniſh flag. Secondly, the privilege of the Spaniſh nation to fiſh on the banks of Newfoundland. Thirdly, the demolition of the Engliſh ſettlements made on the Spaniſh territories in the bay of Honduras.</p>
                        <p>It may be eaſily imagined, from the character of the then ſecretary of ſtate, in what manner he received theſe propoſals: he rejected with the utmoſt ſcorn, the offer of negotiating, through an enemy humbled, and almoſt at his feet, the diſputes of his nation, with a power actually in friendſhip with us. He called upon the Spaniſh miniſter to diſavow the propoſitions, which had been ſaid to be made with the knowledge of his court. He returned as wholly in admiſſible this offenſive memorial, declaring, that it would
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:1261701201:437"/>
be looked upon as an affront to the dignity of his maſter, and incompatible with the ſincerity of the negotiation, to make any further mention of ſuch a circumſtance.</p>
                        <p>And now he prepared, without delay, an anſwer to the principal memorial, in a ſtile rather dictated by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which accompanied that paper, and which ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently indicated the deſigns of France, than what the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions themſelves ſtrictly deſerved. Indeed, as he had by this time conceived an incurable ſuſpicion of the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of France in the whole proceeding, it would not have been prudent to have made thoſe advances, which on a ſuppoſition of good faith and pacific intentions, might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have been adviſeable; for though both powers had over and over declared, that their reſpective propoſitions, if the treaty ſhould by any accident be broken off, would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as retracted or never made; yet it is certain, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> things once ſettled and agreed to, unavoidably ſtamp their own impreſſion upon any future negotiation, relative to the ſame ſubject.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pitt's anſwer, which is dated on the 29th of July, agrees to the reſtitution of Guadaloupe, Marigalante and Belleiſle, on the compenſations propoſed by France. It agrees alſo to receive Canada, but without any new limits or any exception whatſoever; and it adds to the French offer of all Canada, "its appurtenances." It admits the propoſal of the partition of the Neutral Iſlands. It rejects the French demand of Cape Breton, or of any other iſland in the gulph or river of St. Lawrence; or of any power of fiſhing in that river, in that gulph, or on thoſe coaſts; and it allows the privilege of fiſhing on the banks of Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, only on conſideration of the demolition of Dunkirk. But the propoſed reſtitution either of Senegal or Goree, is utterly refuſed. The German neutrality is rejected with diſdain; and it is declared that Great Britain is unalterably reſolved to ſupport the king of Pruſſia with efficacy and good faith. In addition to the offer made to evacuate Heſſe, &amp;c. it is inſiſted that the French ſhall make a general eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of all her conqueſts in Weſtphalia, and all its coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, including its conqueſts from the king of Pruſſia on the Rhine, though France had before declared, that they were conquered for the queen of Hungary, that they were actually governed in her name, and that ſhe could not, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with good faith, agree to deliver them to the king
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:1261701201:438"/>
of Pruſſia. The treaty between Saunders and Godcheau was not admitted as a proper baſis for a treaty relative to the Eaſt Indies. But it was agreed, that the two compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſhould negotiate concerning their reſpective intereſts, as the king of Great Britain could not diſpoſe of the rights of the Engliſh Eaſt India company without their conſent. As to the reſtitution of the captures before the war, this was moſt poſitively refuſed.</p>
                        <p>In this period we leave the negotiation to follow the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the armies in Germany. It is certain, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the two courts grew daily more unfavourable: their confidence in each other, and their mutual good-will wore away; and it was to be feared, that this negotiation, if it broke off in an unſatisfactory manner, muſt leave im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on the minds of the two nations of ſuch a nature, as might cauſe them to wiſh they had never engaged in it.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Motions of the French and allied armies. General Sporcken attacked. French paſs the Dymel. Skirmiſhes. Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of prince Ferdinand.

                        </argument>
                        <p>ALthough the great purpoſe of the early and ſtrenuous effort made by the allies was not fully anſwered, it nevertheleſs produced, as we have before obſerved, a very conſiderable and uſeful effect. The deſtruction of the French magazines retarded their operations in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the greateſt part of the month of June was ſpent before their armies found themſelves in a condition to act. But as ſoon as they had taken proper meaſures for their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, the prince of Soubiſe cauſed his troops to paſs the Rhine, and to advance on the ſide of Munſter, not far from which city the hereditary prince of Brunſwick was poſted to oppoſe him. Marſhal Broglio aſſembled the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:1261701201:439"/>
under his command at Caſſel, and moved towards the Dymel, in order to effect a junction with the body under the prince of Soubiſe. They made no doubt that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining ſtrength would ſoon attain a decided ſuperiority over the allies, who had ended their late enterprize with a loſs which was conſiderable, and which in their circumſtances, they could not well bear, nor eaſily ſupply.</p>
                        <p>Theſe hopes were ſupported by the ſucceſs of their firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. General Sporcken with a ſtrong detachment had been poſted in an advantageous ſituation on the Dymel, and in the front of the allied army. On the approach of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal Broglio, he attempted to retire with all that expedition which his inferiority made neceſſary. But the French came upon him with ſuch rapidity,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 29."/> 

 that they overtook and attacked his rear, which was inſtantly routed; they took 800 priſoners, 19 pieces of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, 400 horſes, and upwards of 170 waggons. The ſame day they paſſed the Dymel; and whilſt prince Ferdinand, diſcouraged by this check, fell back to the Lippe, they made themſelves maſters of Warburg,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 2."/> 

 Drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleburg, and Paderborn.</p>
                        <p>The allies, however, ſoon recovered their ſpirits; and the main body of their army being well ſecured, they ſent out ſeveral detachments. Their ſmall bodies were conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by General Luckner, and other able partizans, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook ſeveral bold and very diſtant enterprizes, attacked the enemy where they were leaſt upon their guard, routed their convoys, deſtroyed ſeveral of their magazines, carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages and horſes, and carried off their prey even from the gates of Caſſel. Theſe lively actions ſeemed a prelude to ſome more important and deciſive attempt.</p>
                        <p>The French became ſenſible that a ſtroke of ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance was expected from the greatneſs of their force, and that it was not for the credit of their arms only, but for their ſecurity from the minute, but continual and galling attempts of parties from the allied army.</p>
                        <p>For ſome time prince Ferdinand had been poſted to the ſouth of the Lippe, between Ham and Lipſtadt. This po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition he took, in all probability, becauſe M. Broglio had, by occupying the places on the Dymel, got between him and Hanover. Therefore he judged it expedient for him in his turn to get between the prince de Soubiſe and the Rhine. In this ſituation, if the enemy attempted any
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:1261701201:440"/>
movement towards the king's dominions, he was ready to fall directly on the places they occupied by that river, which, in the preſent circumſtances, were full as impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to them as the Hanoverian territory was to us. Thus whilſt he ſeemed to retire from that territory, and in a manner to abandon it, he in reality provided with the greater effect for its ſecurity.</p>
                        <p>Marſhal Broglio, when he had reſolved on the attack of the allied army, united his troops to thoſe of the prince de Soubiſe, at a place called Soeſt, between Lipſtadt and Ham. On the other hand, as ſoon as the general of the allies was apprized of their intention he poſted his army in a very ſtrong and advantageous manner.</p>
                        <p>The river Aeſt runs for a conſiderable way, almoſt paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to the Lippe, from which it is not diſtant in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, much more than half a mile. The high road from Lipſtadt, to Ham paſſes between theſe rivers; and it was of the utmoſt moment to prince Ferdinand to ſecure that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant communication by which, alone he could hope an advantageous retreat, or in any degree propoſe to command the adjacent country. With a view therefore to protect that communication, he eſtabliſhed his left wing on the Iſthmus between the rivers. The left extremity of that wing under General Wutgenau, leaning to the Lippe, by which it was perfectly ſecured, as the right was ſupported by the village of Kirch Denkern, ſituated immediately on the Aeſt. The marquis of Granby commanded in that wing, with the aſſiſtance of lieutenant general Howard and the prince of Anhalt, who were poſted towards the above-mentioned village.</p>
                        <p>At that village another river called the Saltzbach, ſmall, but very deep, joins the Aeſt almoſt in a right angle. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind this river on a conſiderable eminence was placed the centre commanded by general Conway; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the ſame eminence, the right wing, under the hereditary prince, ſtretched out towards the village of Werle, and it was well defended on the flank by rugged, buſhy, and almoſt impracticable ground. Nothing could be more advantageous than this diſpoſition of the army, by which the whole centre and right wing were covered in front by the river, and the left ſupported by rivers on both its flanks. In the left indeed was the ſtrength and flower of the army; the count of Lippe had placed alſo in this
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:1261701201:441"/>
wing, the greateſt part of the artillery, as he knew that it defended the moſt important ſituation, was the moſt expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in front, and conſequently would be the object of the enemy's moſt conſiderable efforts.</p>
                        <p>He was not miſtaken in his conjecture. On the 15th of July, in the evening, a very furious attack was made on lord Granby's poſts, which was ſuſtained for a long time with all the intrepidity and firmneſs, which Britiſh troops always exert, and which that gallant officer knows ſo well how to inſpire. The diſpoſition we have juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, was not then compleated; ſo that they had the whole torrent of that impetuoſity, which diſtinguiſhes the French in their firſt attacks, to reſiſt for ſome hours, until Wutgenau, according to the plan originally projected, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to their aſſiſtance, and then with efforts united and redoubled in a long and obſtinate combat, which continued untill it was quite dark, they repulſed the French and drove them into the woods.</p>
                        <p>By the next morning, the diſpoſition of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies was perfected;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 16."/> 

 and it was evident that the French, far from being diſmayed by their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, were preparing for a more general and better ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed attack than the former. M. Broglio commanded againſt our left, which, as on the preceeding day, was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal object of the enemy. The prince de Soubiſe led their centre on their left. The engagement began at three in the morning, and it was a ſevere and continued fire for upwards of five hours, before the leaſt effect could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on either ſide. The weight of the attack this day lay on Wutgenau's corps, which ſupported it with a degree of bravery, that rivaled the ſtand which had been lately made by the Britiſh forces. But about nine, the prince diſcovered that the enemy were preparing to erect batteries on an emminence, in the front of the Marquis of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's camp, which he had not been able to encloſe within his lines. Senſible of the preſſing neceſſity there was of preventing the enemy from ſeizing on an eminence, from whence they might cruelly gall his army, he called in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, which had been placed at the other ſide of the Lippe under general Sporcken. Strengthened by this ſupply, and encouraged by the irreſolution which now began to appear in the motions of the enemy, he commanded the troops which were neareſt at hand to advance upon them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="391" facs="tcp:1261701201:442"/>This movement was deciſive, the enemy gave way, fell into diſorder, and retired with precipitation. Their centre and left, which had not been able to paſs the Saltzbach, after a long and effectual cannonade, retired with the reſt, and covered their retreat; ſo that favour'd by this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and the cloſeneſs of the country, which was full of hedges, they marched off in tolerable order, and were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued but a little way. However, their loſs was conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: the Regiment of Rouge, conſiſting of four battalions, with its cannon and colours, was entirely taken by the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle battalion of Maxwell. Their whole loſs in killed, wounded, and priſoners, has been eſtimated at 5000. The allies had about 300 killed, 1000 wounded, and about 200 priſoners. This action was the climax of the campaign of 1761

                                    <p>ON the 15th of <hi>July</hi> the <hi>French</hi> attacked the light troops in the front of Lord <hi>Granby</hi>'s corps, which was encamped on the heights of <hi>Kirch Denckern.</hi> His Lordſhip ordered the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Cornwallis, Keith, Campbell,</hi> and <hi>Marsberg,</hi> to the left to ſupport the poſts. There was an uninterupted fire of cannon and ſmall arms, till nine at night, when it ceaſed, without any impreſſion having been made by the enemy upon Lord <hi>Granby</hi>'s left.</p>
                                    <p>In the morning of the 16th, about three o'clock the canno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nading began very briſkly on both ſides, and continued till nine, when the enemy gave way in great diſorder. His moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene highneſs the Duke, then ordered the corps of the prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> Lord <hi>Granby</hi> and <hi>Wutgenau,</hi> to attack them on their retreat; which they did with ſo much vigour that the enemy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attempted to form before them, but threw down their arms and ran off in the utmoſt diſorder.</p>
                                    <p>When major <hi>Wedderbourn</hi> came away, there were ſix colours already taken, eleven or twelve pieces of cannon; many officers, amongſt whom the Comte <hi>de Rouge,</hi> and great part of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>De Rouge, Dauphin,</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> to the amount of 3000 men.</p>
                                    <p>After having purſued them about a league, the duke ordered the troops to form upon the heights of <hi>Kirch Denckern.</hi> The he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary prince was ſtill driving the enemy on their left.

, in Weſtphalia; it did the greateſt honour to the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:1261701201:443"/>
wiſdom of the accompliſhed commander in the diſpoſition, and to the bravery of the troops in the combat; but it was far from deciſive. Notwithſtanding the loſs the French ſuffered, they were ſtill much ſuperior, in their numbers. On this misfortune the old ill underſtanding between Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſe and Broglio broke out with freſh animoſity. Narratives, memorials, and replies, conceived with great bitterneſs, were mutually remitted from both marſhals to their court. Marſhal Broglio alledged, that his misfortune was owing to the prince de Soubiſe's delay, who did not begin the attack till it was too late for him to continue it; the prince de Soubiſe, on the other hand, ſuggeſted, that Broglio began his attack earlier than the time that had been fixed, in hopes of forcing the allies without Soubiſe's aſſiſtance; and when he found that point loſt, obliged Soubiſe to retreat, that he might not have the honour of recovering it.</p>
                        <p>The allies after this battle kept their ground for ſome time, whilſt the French retreated. It is impoſſible regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to account for all the unexpected turns which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, perhaps, more in this campaign, than in any of the former. It is enough to know that the original ſuperiority of the French, together with their opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual reinforcement, may very tolerably explain the reaſon
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:1261701201:444"/>
of the advantages which they ſo often obtained after very conſiderable defeats. This is a point which it is neceſſary the reader ſhould continually keep in his mind during the whole narration of this ſtrange war. After their late loſs and retreat, the French ſoon advanced again. The party under the prince de Soubiſe paſſed the Lippe, and made diſpoſitions for the ſiege of Munſter, whilſt marſhal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio's army turned off on the other ſide, croſſed the Weſer, and threatened to fall in upon Hanover.</p>
                        <p>This diviſion of the enemy compelled prince Ferdinand, though little in a condition for it, to divide his army alſo. The hereditary prince poſted himſelf to cover Munſter; whilſt prince Ferdinand continued in the country towards the Weſer, to obſerve the motions of marſhal Broglio.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt theſe various poſitions were mutually taken, as the armies were continually moving near each other, a number of very ſharp ſkirmiſhes enſued. Marſhal Broglio cautiouſly avoided a battle whenever he ſaw that the duke of Brunſwick, by calling together his troops, had prepared for, and was deſirous of it; ſo that there was no way left, but if poſſible, to check his motions, and wear down his force, by reiterated leſſer actions

which were eſtabliſhed here, and by this means not only fruſtrated their deſign of beſieging Munſter, but compelled them for a time, to retire from the Lippe.</p>
                        <p>As to prince Ferdinand, he ſaw clearly, that the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of marſhal Broglio were to make himſelf maſter of his majeſty's, and the duke of Brunſwick's territories. To at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to follow him, and to beat him from thence, would only be irrecoverably to transfer the ſeat of war into thoſe countries, and wholly to abandon Weſtphalia to the enemy. Diverſion therefore, and not direct oppoſition, became his object. He reſolved, that as often as he perceived marſhal Broglio making any progreſs on the ſuſpected quarter, he ſhould throw himſelf as far into Heſſe as the enemy had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards Hanover, and by ſtopping their ſubſiſtence, oblige them to quit their enterprize. This plan at firſt ſucceeded to his wiſhes, and drew back marſhal Broglio into Heſſe, upon whoſe approach prince Ferdinand retired to his old quarters at Paderborn, and ready for a new movement as ſoon as Broglio ſhould return to the execution of his former deſign.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Oct. 19."/> 
                        </p>
                        <p>Accordingly he ſoon returned to the Weſer. Then the hereditary prince, who had by this time re-joined the grand army, advanced into Heſſe, and puſhed to the fartheſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of that country, even as far as Fritzlar; but tho' he ſucceeded ſo far in his attempts as to deſtroy all the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer magazines which he found in the open country; yet as all the fortreſſes were in the hands of the enemy, as the garriſons had been newly reinforced and the grand maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines were well ſecured in thoſe places, he kept his ground in his advanced poſition.</p>
                        <p>It was on this occaſion principally that prince Ferdinand found the diſadvantage of not being able to form two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which might act ſeperately. For on one hand, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal Broglio, when he had perfectly ſecured his poſts in Heſſe, took a ſituation in which he watched all the motions of prince Ferdinand, and kept himſelf in readineſs to fall back into Heſſe, or to advance into Hanover, as might beſt agree with his deſigns. From hence he ſent out ſome pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful detachments which acted with great effect. One of theſe detachments entered the Harts Foreſt (the remains of the great Hercynian, ſo famous among the antients) and beſieged the ſtrong caſtle of Schartsfelts, which they took and demoliſhed. Then they laid the whole tract of country
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:1261701201:449"/>
under ſevere contribution. Another, and ſtill more powerful detachment under prince Xavier of Saxony appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Wolfenbuttle, a conſiderable city, and ſtrongly ſituated,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Oct. 5."/> 

 as it is wholly ſurrounded by the Ocker. But the French, as they knew that the town is moſtly built of wood, commenced their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with a very fierce bombardment. This had ſuch an effect, that the reſiſtance of the place was not proportioned to its ſtrength; in five days it ſurrendered, and was ſubject, like the reſt, to a grievous contribution.</p>
                        <p>Fluſhed with this ſucceſs, the French followed their blow, and advanced, keeping ſtill the courſe of the Ocker, to Brunſwick; and began alſo to inveſt that city. The reigning prince, unable to protect his ſubjects, or to ſecure his perſon in his dominions, fled to Hamburgh, where he met the landgrave of Heſſe, whom the rage of war had in the ſame manner driven from his territories. This free ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty now became a place of general refuge, and enriched it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the calamities, as it had in better times done by the proſperity of Germany. It was lately computed, that the ſtrangers there had increaſed to 40,000, amongſt whom they could reckon two ſovereign princes, and ſeveral other perſons of the firſt diſtinction.</p>
                        <p>This rapid and unreſiſted progreſs of the French to the eaſtward of the Weſer, was to the higheſt degree alarming. Prince Ferdinand with all the expedition in his power, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached the hereditary prince to the relief of Brunſwick. This meaſure fortunately ſaved that very important place. This active commander compelled the enemy not only to raiſe the ſiege of Brunſwick, but to abandon Wolfenbuttel, and to make a precipitate retreat with the loſs of ſome of their cannon, and upwards of 1000 men.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt Broglio's detachments proceeded thus in diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the country to the eaſtward of the Weſer, the prince of Soubiſe, who by the removal of the hereditary prince of Brunſwick to another quarter, ſaw no longer any thing ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of oppoſing him, ſpread his army by detachments over all Weſtphalia, and ravaged it in the moſt cruel man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. They took Oſnabrug; and becauſe the contributions were not immediately paid, they gave up the place to be pillaged by their troops, who rifled the miſerable inhabitants without mercy. Another body puſhed as far as Embden. This important town was immediately ſurrendered by the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:1261701201:450"/>
garriſon (two Engliſh companies of invalids) at the deſire of the timid inhabitants, and the promiſe of a favourable treatment: notwithſtanding this capitulation, and the merit of ſo eaſy a ſurrender, the town, as well as the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Eaſt-Frieſland, was laid under a ruinous contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But their exorbitances grew to ſuch an extremity, that the boors were at length compelled to riſe, and with ſuch arms as a ſudden rage ſupplied them, to drive theſe oppreſſors out of their country.</p>
                        <p>A more conſiderable corps commanded by the prince de Conde, laid ſiege to Meppen, a place on the Ems, of ſome conſequence,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Oct. 13."/> 

 and where we had ſome magazines. In three days it was reduced, and the garriſon of five hundred men were made priſoners of war.</p>
                        <p>The city of Bremen was defended by a weak garriſon. This was a place of far greater moment than Meppen, the allies having amaſſed their immenſe magazines, as it was a great and trading town, advantageouſly ſituated on the river Weſer; and the poſſeſſion of this place muſt undoubtedly have given to the French the command of that river, thro' which the allies derived all their ſubſiſtence. If the Engliſh had loſt Bremen, they muſt have ſeen themſelves inveſted and locked up in a barren counrry, in the heart of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſurrounded by their enemies, and deprived of every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource. Fortunately the inhabitants of this city proved as brave as thoſe of Embden were timid. They were exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the example of the French rigour, which they had ſeen on every ſide of them. They therefore joined the garriſon, inſtead of diſcouraging them in the defence of the place. The French were obliged to retire precipitately; and a ſtrong reinforcement was thrown into Bremen, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that very important city from the like enterprizes for the future.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt the two French armies in this manner ravaged all the country held by the allies, prince Ferdinand, who ſaw the rage of war ſpread all around him, with his uſual firmneſs, kept that central poſition which he had taken ſoon after the battle of Kirch Denkern; no movements of the enemy could terrify or allure him from it. He had ſettled his head quarters at Buhne, and his army extended from thence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Hammelen. Poſted in this manner, he ſecured the courſe of the Weſer, by preventing the enemy from making
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:1261701201:451"/>
themſelves maſters either of Hammelen or Minden; he lay in the beſt ſituation in which it was poſſible to place a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle army, that was to act againſt two; and knowing that he could not follow their movements with the body of his army, without hazarding the king's electoral dominions, and indeed every object of the war, he contented himſelf with ſending out ſuch detachments as he could ſpare, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively to the relief of the places which were attacked. He ſaw that the winter approached, which had always been a circumſtance fayourable to him; and it was evident that whilſt he continued with his main body immoveably fixed as it was, and his detachments active on every ſide, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the enemy to keep any of thoſe places, they had ſeized in their incurſions.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>UNTIL this year the operations of the Pruſſian armies took the lead in intereſt and importance before all the other events of the war. The firmneſs and activity of their illuſtrious monarch, the number and animoſity of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the blows that he gave, and thoſe that he ſuffered, his diſtreſſing and terrible falls, his amazing and almoſt miraculous recoveries, kept all eyes fixed on his motions, as the great centre of public attention. Undoubtedly nothing that has ever been acted on the ſcene of human affairs, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the minds of men to it with greater juſtice; none perhaps afforded at once more entertainment to the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and furniſhed more copious materials for political and military inſtruction; and probably, therefore, this part of all our modern hiſtory, will be the moſt carefully ſtudied by poſterity, when it comes to be properly known, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily written.</p>
                        <p>To judge of the importance of this branch of the general
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:1261701201:452"/>
war, it will be proper to recollect that, beſides a number of ſieges which were proſecuted, together with innumerable and bloody ſkirmiſhes, no leſs than nineteen pitched battles, or capital actions, have been fought on his part ſince the cloſe of the year 1756, when the king of Pruſſia firſt ſeized upon Saxony, and made an iruption into Bohemia. In eleven of theſe battles, the King or his generals were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated. He was victorious only in eight. Ten of them were fought under his own command; and ſeven out of the eight victories which were gained, were obtained by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in perſon; of the eleven defeats, he was preſent only at three.</p>
                        <p>From theſe circumſtances ſome judgment may be formed of the active and enterprizing character of this monarch, and of the amazing reſource he had prepared, or formed, or ſeized, and in ſome inſtances, one may ſay, almoſt creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We have obſerved that the laſt campaign had ended more to his advantage than the one preceding had done; for thoſe two great victories of Lignitz and Torgau, with which he then ended his operations, had not only reſcued his affairs in Sileſia and Saxony from impending deſtruction, but had enlarged his field for recruiting, and prepared him, to all appearance, for more early and vigorous action, than could have been expected in moſt of the preceding cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns. But every one was ſurprized to obſerve, that this year he had totally altered the ſyſtem of his conduct. An inactivity and languor was diffuſed over all his proceedings. He ſeemed to have adopted the caution and ſlowneſs which had been ſo long oppoſed to his vivacity by M. Daun. The ſummer was almoſt wholly ſpent, and the King of Pruſſia had ſcarcely been mentioned.</p>
                        <p>It was not ſuſpected that the propoſed negotiation at Augſburg could have had much, if any influence upon his method of proceeding. No particular propoſals had been made concerning his affairs, nor indeed any other marks of a pacific diſpoſition towards him ſhewn, except what were contained in thoſe general declarations, which a regard to common decency had exacted. It muſt have added to the anxiety of his ſituation, that Great Britain and France were at that time engaged in a ſeparate treaty, in which the latter power was in a condition to make ſo many flattering offers in relation to Germany, that he might well have dreaded the withdrawing of that aſſiſtance which had hitherto been
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:1261701201:453"/>
his great ſupport againſt all attacks, and his final reſource in all his diſtreſſes. Perhaps he was well aſſured, that the faith of Great Britain was proof againſt every offer, however alluring; in fact it proved to be ſo; for in rejecting the German neutrality, which the French propoſed in the late negotiation, our country afforded as convincing a proof of an unſhaken public faith, as any people had ever given to their allies.</p>
                        <p>However, whilſt this point remained in any degree of ſuſpence, it would have appeared natural, that the King of Pruſſia ſhould make ſome uncommon exertions to confirm the faith of his allies, as well as to put himſelf upon a more reſpectable footing at the enſuing congreſs. It is, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding certain, that he contented himſelf with acting wholly upon the defenſive; a conduct, which perhaps his circumſtances had rendered abſolutely unavoidable. Prince Henry commanded an army in Saxony, which intrenched itſelf ſtrongly under Leipſic. M. Daun continued near Dreſden; and theſe two armies did no more than watch each other during the campaign. The King was alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched in a very ſtrong poſition in Upper Sileſia, not far from Schweidnitz, whilſt the fortreſſes in the lower part of that country were filled with ſuch garriſons, as put them out of the reach of any ſudden inſult.</p>
                        <p>This poſition was pointed out by the motions and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent deſigns of his enemies. The Ruſſian army was this year, as well as in the former, divided into two ſtrong bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; one of which, led by Tottleben, directed its march towards Pomerania: and the other under M. Butterlin, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the upper Sileſia, advancing towards Breſlau Baron Laudohn entered that province in the part oppoſite to them, and they propoſed to unite their armies, in order to attack the King, or to take Breſlau or Schweidnitz in his preſence. The remarkable drought in the beginning of the ſeaſon, which had greatly lowered the Oder, facilitated their junction. The Ruſſians ſpread themſelves over all the open country of Sileſia; and exacted heavy contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 1."/> 

 A body of them appeared before Breſlau, and began to cannonade the town from ſeven bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries. Laudohn exerted the whole of his ſkill to draw the king from his poſt, and to engage him in a diſadvantageous action. Sometimes he advanced, as if he meant to join the Ruſſians: ſometimes his motions indicated a deſign on Sch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weidnitz;
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:1261701201:454"/>
theſe attempts failing, he turned off and made a feint as if he propoſed to fall upon the Lower Sileſia, in hopes that he might at leaſt oblige the King of Pruſſia to detach and divide his forces; but the King continued im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable in his poſt.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt theſe various movements were making with little effect, on the ſide of Sileſia, the other grand diviſion of the Ruſſians advanced without oppoſition into Pomerania; and it was expected that their proceedings would be attended with greater effect ſince the removal of Tottleben, and the appointment of general Romanzow to the command. Tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleben had been long ſuſpected, and, it is ſaid, at length convicted, of a ſecret correſpondence with the King of Pruſſia. The ſituation of this Monarch obliged him to fight with every ſort of weapon; and Tottleben, a ſoldier of fortune, without any national attachment or particular allegiance, was a fit object for the King of Pruſſia's pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary ſtratagems. He did not ſucceed ſo well in the attempts of the ſame kind which he is ſaid to have made upon Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dohn. Every circumſtance concurred to render the method of corruption leſs ſucceſsful in that quarter.</p>
                        <p>Colberg, regularly beſieged, or cloſely ſtreightened every campaign, ſince the Ruſſians made themſelves maſters of the kingdom of Pruſſia, was now aſſaulted with greater and more determined force than ever. A ſtrong fleet conſiſting of forty ſail of all kinds, blockaded it by ſea, whilſt the army of general Romanzow formed the ſiege by land. On the other hand, the place threatened a defence worthy of its former efforts. This city was from the beginning of the war of greater ſtrength than it had commonly been repreſented; every attempt of the Ruſſians, by demonſtrating where any weakneſs lay, taught the Pruſſians, who were fully ſenſible of its importance, in what part and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it was neceſſary to add to its works; and they had omitted no opportunity. In addition to this defence, the Prince of Wurtenburg was ſtrongly intrenched under the cannon of the town, with a body of ſix or ſeven thouſand men.</p>
                        <p>The King of Pruſſia was extremely alarmed at the danger of this momentous poſt, the key of his dominions to the north, from the relief of which he was removed, and, as it were, chained down, at ſuch an immenſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

employment for his forces, he reſolved to ſend a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able detachment under general Platen to the aſſiſtance of Colberg. The fertility of his genius propoſed two ends from this ſingle expedient. He ordered Platen to direct his march through Poland, and to deſtroy the Ruſſian maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines, which had been amaſſed on the frontiers of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and from which their army in Sileſia drew its whole ſubſiſtence. This ſervice, might, he hoped, be performed without any conſiderable interruption to the progreſs of the detachment towards Colberg. The event was entirely anſwerable to his wiſhes. General Platen ruined three principal magazines of the enemy. He attacked a great convoy of their waggons; deſtroyed 500, and burned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

General Platen, after this uſeful and brilliant exploit, purſued his march with the utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to Pomerania.</p>
                        <p>Intelligence of this blow was no ſooner received by the Ruſſians in Sileſia, than they were ſtruck with the utmoſt conſternation. They had lately effected one of their purpoſes by their junction with the Auſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 25."/> 

 but this ſtroke compelled them at once to ſever this union, ſo lately and with ſuch difficulty compaſſed to drop all their deſigns upon Breſlau, to repaſs the Oder, and to retire without delay into Poland, leſt their remaining magazines ſhould ſhare the ſame fate with the three above-mentioned, and there future ſubſiſtence be thereby rendered wholly precarious.</p>
                        <p>So unfortunately circumſtanced were the affairs of the King of Pruſſia, that his wiſeſt ſchemes and happieſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes could hardly anſwer any other end than to vary the ſcene of his diſtreſs. The ſtorm which had been diverted from Sileſia by general Platen's expedition, was only remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thence to be diſcharged with irreſiſtible fury on Colberg. The Ruſſians, when they ſaw that the meaſures the king had taken, rendered the completion of both their deſigns impracticable, reſolved at all adventures to ſecure one of them. Colberg was the object of their choice, not only as the place furtheſt from ſuccour but as the poſſeſſion of it would be an advantage fitteſt for anſwering thoſe ends which were more nearly and properly Ruſſian. M. Buttur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, therefore, as ſoon as he had eſtabliſhed his convoys, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:1261701201:456"/>
his courſe towards Pomerania, and being maſter of Lanſperg, he ſent detachments from thence, that cruelly waſted all the adjoining Marche of Brandenburg, without at the ſame time diverting himſelf by theſe ravages from his main intention.</p>
                        <p>A force of Ruſſians was by this time aſſembled in Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rania, to which it was impoſſible for the king of Pruſſia to oppoſe any thing that was in any degree able to contend with them in the field; of courſe he could not promiſe himſelf that immediate raiſing the ſiege could be the effect of theſe ſuccours. All he could do was to ſend another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to that part under general Knoblock; and hoped that by the union of theſe ſeveral ſmall corps, and by their intercepting or at leaſt diſtreſſing the Ruſſian convoys of proviſion, the place might be enabled to hold out, until the ſevere ſetting in of winter ſhould render the operations of a ſiege impracticable.</p>
                        <p>He was providing in this manner, and ſtudying new me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods for the relief of Colberg, to the danger of which place his whole attention was drawn, when an event happened juſt by him, and, as it were, under his eye, almoſt as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing as the taking of Colberg would have proved, and ſo much the more diſtreſſing, as it was entirely unexpected.</p>
                        <p>On the retreat of the Ruſſians under Butturlin, the king of Pruſſia imagined himſelf at liberty. He found a want of proviſions in his ſtrong camp near Schweidnitz, and to be the more eaſily ſupplied, he aproached nearer to the Oder, He was ſo little in fear of the enemy, that on making this movement he drafted 4000 men from the garriſon of Sch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>widnitz: he thought that the preparations neceſſary to a ſiege would give him ſufficient notice, and ſufficient leiſure to provide for the ſafety of that important place, from which after all, he had removed but to a very ſmall diſtance. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dohn, who through the whole campaign had watched the king with a moſt diligent and penetrating aſſiduity, and hitherto had found no part open and unguarded, thought in this inſtant he perceived an advantage. It was indeed an advantage which would never have appeared as ſuch, but to a general as reſolute as ſagacious. He reſolved to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt this ſtrong place, by a <hi>coup de main.</hi> On the 1ſt of October at three in the morning, the aſſault began. An attack was made at the ſame time on all the four outworks which the troops, ordered on this important enterprize ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:1261701201:457"/>
with ſo much precaution, that they were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the garriſon. They ſcaled all the four at the ſame time; and the troops which defended them had ſcarce time to fire a few cannon ſhot. On the ſide of the aſſailants, not a gun was diſcharged: but in one of thoſe out-works the fire of the ſmall arms ſet fire to a powder magazine, which blew up, and on this occaſion about 300 of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrians, and about the ſame number of the Pruſſians were killed. As ſoon at the out-works were carried, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to aſſault the body of the place, which they entered by burſting open the gates, and at day-break they found themſelves-maſters of the town after firing a few ſhot. Five battalions, making about 3000 men, and lieutenant-general Zaſtrow, governor of the fortreſs, were made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. The conquerors found here a great number of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and a large magazine of meal. Their loſs in the whole of this bold and fortunate undertaking amounted, by their accounts, to no more than 600 men.</p>
                        <p>In a manner ſo unexpected, and conſidering the nature of the fortifications, ſo unprecedented, Schweidnitz fell for a ſecond time in this war into the hands of the Auſtrians; and that city, which in the year 1758 had coſt the Pruſſians a blockade of ſome months, and a ſiege of thirteen days open trenches to recover it, was again loſt in a few hours, and with a very inconſiderable damage to thoſe who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took this daring enterprize.</p>
                        <p>The king of Pruſſia felt this grievous blow to the quick. By their poſſeſſion of Schweidnitz he ſaw the Auſtrians en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to winter in Sileſia; he ſaw that whilſt they held this place, he could poſſibly make no motion for the relief of any other part of his dominions, without expoſing Breſlau, and along with it the whole of Upper Sileſia, to a certain and irrecoverable conqueſt. In the firſt agitations produced by ſo extraordinary and affecting a diſaſter, he was diſpoſed to attribute this misfortune to the treachery of the governor, but he was too generous to harbour ſuch a ſuſpicion, for any time, againſt an officer who had hitherto ſerved him with fidelity, and who might have been ſurprized with an attack of ſo uncommon a nature, and which the king him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had as little ſuſpected as the governor. He immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered his temper, and ſaid with a ſmile,
<q>It is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal blow; we muſt endeavour to remedy it.</q>
He wrote to general Zaſtrow, who commanded there,
<q>We may
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:1261701201:458"/>
now ſay, what Francis I. of France wrote to his mother after the battle of Pavia, <hi>We have loſt all except our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> As I cannot comprehend what hath happened to you, I ſhall ſuſpend my judgment; the thing is very extraordinary.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Schweidnitz was loſt ſuddenly; but Colberg made a moſt obſtinate and noble defence, At length, however, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon began to be ſorely diſtreſſed for proviſions. General Platen quitted the intrenchments, which he had maintained in conjunction with the prince of Wurtenburg, in order to cover the reinforcements, which the numerous and ſtrong detachments of the Ruſſians, who overſpread the whole country, had hitherto kept at a diſtance. But he had the misfortune to meet an infinitely ſuperior body of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to be beaten, and to loſe part of his convoy; and it was with difficulty he eſcaped with the remainder to Stettin.</p>
                        <p>The other (general Knoblock) had eſtabliſhed himſelf at Treptow, which was to ſerve as a reſting place for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys; but as general Platen had been repulſed, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we have juſt ſeen, Romanzow advanced with a large force to Treptow. Knoblock, hopeleſs of aſſiſtance in a town which had ſcarcely any walls, and inveſted by a body ſo vaſtly ſuperior, yet made a vigorous and gallant defence for five days; he was at length compelled to ſurrender him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his body of about 2000 men priſoners of war.</p>
                        <p>Theſe ſucceſſive diſaſters were occaſioned by the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſity there was for revictualling Colberg, coſt what it would, for that end, of diſperſing the Pruſſian troops in the face of a Ruſſian army of 50,000 men. The revictualling in theſe circumſtances could not be effected without a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular piece of good fortune; and, in order to get into the way of this good fortune, every riſque was to be run.</p>
                        <p>Theſe advantages over Platen and Knoblock raiſed the ſpirits of the Ruſſians, and enabled them to contend with the extreme rigour of the ſeaſon in that northern latitude; they puſhed the ſiege with redoubled efforts. All hope of a ſupply from the land was abſolutely at an end; and though the Ruſſian fleet had been by a violent ſtorm driven off the coaſt, the ſuccour from the ſea was too precarious to be depended on. In this deſperate ſituation the prince of Wur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenburg became apprehenſive, leſt his army, which had been unable to relieve the town, by delaying any longer
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:1261701201:459"/>
under its walls would only ſhare its fate, and that famine might alſo oblige him to ſurrender. He therefore reſolved, whilſt his men retained their vigour, to break through a part of the Ruſſian army, and to leave Colberg to make the beſt terms its circumſtances would admit. This deſign he accompliſhed happily, and with little or no loſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Dec. 16th."/> 

And now Colberg, hopleſs of all relief, the garriſon exhauſted, proviſion low, the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in many places battered to pieces, after a long ſiege of near ſix months, ſurrendered to the Ruſſians. The governor and the garriſon were made priſoners of war. This place was defended by the gallant <hi>Heyde,</hi> who to this time had maintained it ſucceſsfully againſt all the efforts of the Ruſſians during the war; and as he was diſtinguiſhed by the king his maſter, for his merit in the ſucceſsful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it, he had likewiſe as full aſſurances of his favours after having on the late occaſion conducted himſelf with his former bravery, though it was not with the former good fortune.</p>
                        <p>The loſs of two ſuch places as Schweidnitz and Colberg, at the two extremities of his dominions, was deciſive againſt the king of Pruſſia. It was now impoſſible for him to make any movement by which the enemy could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to his almoſt certain deſtruction. To form ſieges, with an army like his, inferior in the field, was impoſſible. The Ruſſians, by poſſeſſing Colberg, poſſeſſed every thing. They were maſters of the Baltic; and they now acquired a port, by which their armies could be well provided, without the neceſſity of tedious, uncertain, and expenſive convoys from Poland, The road lay almoſt open into the heart of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg. Stetin alone ſtood in their way; but it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious that nothing but the advanced ſeaſon could ſave Stetin from the fate of Colberg. The Ruſſians, now for the firſt time, took up their winter quarters in Pomerania.</p>
                        <p>It is remarkable, that this whole year paſſed without a regular battle between the king of Pruſſia and any of his enemies, yet none of the moſt unfortunate of his campaigns had been ſo ruinous to him. He had ſuffered four terrible defeats, without having ballanced them with a ſingle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of conſequence in the campaign of 1759. Yet in theſe circumſtances it is almoſt incredible how little he really loſt. He was able to take the field again the enſuing year in a very reſpectable manner, and to make head
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:1261701201:460"/>
againſt his enemies. In that year he loſt a whole army near Landſhut; ſtill he was far from being broken. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in that ſame campaign, he gave his enemies two ſignal defeats, and ended his operations advantageouſly, and with great glory. But in the year, of which we now write, without ſuffering any conſiderable blow in the field, without any ſtriking efforts on any ſide, his power has gradually crumbled away. The moſt calamitous defeats could not ſink him lower. And in the ſituation in which he ſtood after the taking of Colberg, we may ſafely ſay, that there was ſcarcely a poſſibility that he could be preſerved from deſtruction by any thing that lay within the reach of human endeavours.</p>

                           <p>The negotiation reſumed. French conceſſions. Difference concerning the German alliance. Difference concerning the captures antecedent to the declaration of war. Treaty breaks off. Meſſieurs Stanley and Buſſy recalled.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AFTER having been ſo long detained on the theatre of war, it is time we ſhould return to take a view of the negotiation for putting an end to the miſeries it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned. In reality the view, even of this ſcene, was very glooming and unpromiſing. The confidence and good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the two courts being ſubverted, all that followed was rather an altercation than a treaty. It is true, that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers paſſed backward and forward; and the pretenſions of each party, the points they agreed to cede, and thoſe which they were determined to adhere to, grew more diſtinct and explicit. But all that cordiality was vaniſhed, which is ſo neceſſary towards ſmoothing and clearing a road, which a long hoſtility had broken up, and ſo many intricate topics had contributed to embarraſs.</p>
                        <p>Without involving ourſelves in the detail of the ſeveral memorials which were delivered in and without referring numerically to the ſeveral articles, it will be ſufficient that we briefly ſtate thoſe points which were, or ſeemed to be, in a fair way of adjuſtment between England and France; and afterwards thoſe on which it ſhould appear that the negotiation broke off.</p>
                        <p>After ſome diſcuſſions concerning its proper limits, it was
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:1261701201:461"/>
agreed, that all Canada ſhould be ceded to the Engliſh. This ceſſion comprehended, on one ſide, all the iſlands and countries adjoining to the gulph of St. Lawrence. On the other, it took in all the great lakes, and the whole courſe of the Ohio, to its diſcharge into the Miſſiſippi. A territory ſufficient for the baſis of a great empire.</p>
                        <p>In drawing this line of diviſion, another queſtion aroſe concerning the bounds of Louiſiana, and the ſtate of the intermediate Indian nation between the lakes and the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſippi, who inhabit, or are rather ſcattered over an immenſe country, that lies along the back of our colonies all the way from Penſylvania to Georgia. It was therefore very proper that ſomething definitive ſhould be ſettled on this article, as it might otherwiſe eaſily be made productive of a new war, England propoſed that all thoſe nations ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, as ſhe contended they had heretofore been, under the protection of Great Britain, without ſaying any thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe as to the dominion of the ſoil.</p>
                        <p>France controverted this propoſition; ſhe on her part propoſed to divide theſe nations; that thoſe to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the line drawn to aſcertain the limits of Canada ſhould be independent, under the protection of England, but that thoſe, which were to the ſouthward, ſhould enjoy the ſame independence, under the protection of France. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was perfectly ſettled in relation to this point; but it does not ſeem as if there could have been any material diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement upon it had the other matters in debate been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted to their mutual ſatisfaction.</p>
                        <p>The African conteſt ſeemed to have been attended with ſtill leſs difficulty. The French conſented to give up both Senegal and Goree, provided Anamaboo and Acra were guarantied to them.</p>
                        <p>The momentous queſtion of the fiſhery was likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, The French gave up their claim to Cape Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and St. John's, and were ſatisfied to receive the little iſland of St, Pierre on the coaſt of Newfoundland; but even this they were to receive on conditions ſufficiently humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating. They were to erect no ſort of fortification, nor to keep up any military eſtabliſhment there. An Engliſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary was to reſide on the iſland, in order to ſee that theſe ſtipulations were adhered to. As to the reſt, the French were to have the ſame privileges on the coaſt of Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, checked with the ſame reſtrictions, which before the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:1261701201:462"/>
war they had enjoyed under the 15th article of the treaty of Utrecht. In conformity to another article of that treaty, and in compenſation for the privilege of the fiſhery, they conſented that Dunkirk ſhould be demoliſhed.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the iſlands of Guadaloupe, Marigalante, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norca and Belleiſle, no great controverſy had ſubſiſted from the beginning. It had all along been agreed, that, theſe conqueſts ſhould be reciprocally reſtored. Neither did the French ſcruple to adopt our propoſal concerning the affairs of the Eaſt-Indies, nor to make ſatisfactory declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning Oſtend and Nieuport.</p>
                        <p>So many delicate and intereſting points were ſettled, that it does not firſt appear what it was that could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded the peace. A diſcuſſion of the ſeperate intereſts of two powers only, that are in earneſt to agree, may be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled without any very conſiderable difficulty. The hard and almoſt inextricable part of the knot, is that wherein the croſs concerns and intereſts of allies intervene. There were two points upon which, if we may form a judgment from appearances, this negotiation unfortunately broke off. The firſt was upon the manner in which England and France might be at liberty to aſſiſt their reſpective allies; and on the reſtitution of Weſel, Gueldres, and ſuch other places as the French had conquered from his Pruſſian majeſty.</p>
                        <p>On the firſt member of this principal point, the repeated propoſals of France for a neutrality in Germany had been uniformly and poſitively rejected by our adminiſtration. They were conſidered as ſo many attacks upon national integrity. This ſcheme therefore, not being admitted they would or could come to no agreement, and ſcarcely to an intelligible explanation either of the mode or the quantity of the aſſiſtance which they ſhould be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty mutually to impart to their German allies, or of the place in which ſuch ſuccours ſhould be employed. As to Weſel and Gueldres, the French obſtinately refuſed to reſtore thoſe places. They declared that ſuch a ceſſion would be directly againſt the faith by which they were bound to the empreſs queen of Hungary, for whom they inſiſted that theſe places had been conquered, and in whoſe name alone they were governed, though they had been reduced by the French arms, and were at that moment held by French garriſons.</p>
                        <p>As to the ſecond point, namely, the reſtitution of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:1261701201:463"/>
                           <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

made previous to the declaration of war, the negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating powers were equally poſitive, the one to demand, the other to refuſe it. The Engliſh argued that this claim had no ſort of foundation in the law of nations, neither was it grounded on any particular convention. That the right of all hoſtile operations reſults, not from a formal declaration of war but from the hoſtilities which the aggreſſor has firſt offered; that the contrary of this propoſition is at leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely conteſtible; and ſince, it can by no means be clearly eſtabliſhed, it follows that the detainment of thoſe captures muſt be conſidered, on the ſide of England, as part of the <hi>uti poſſidetis,</hi> originally propoſed as the baſis of this treaty.</p>
                        <p>France on the other hand, ſeemed as fully convinced of the juſtice of her pretenſions, and ſhe deemed the arguments with which ſhe ſupported them to be ſo unanſwerable, that ſhe offered to ſubmit them to the juſtice of the Engliſh tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals. They urged that this claim of reſtitution was founded on the law of nations, and upon particular conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; by the 19th article of the peace of Utrecht; and by the ſecond article of the treaty of commerce; and that this was ſtrengthened by the third article of the treaty of Aix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la-Chappelle, which renews and confirms thoſe articles in the preceeding treaties.</p>
                        <p>By theſe articles a protection is allowed to the reſpective ſubjects who may have ſhips in the ports of either of the powers, becauſe having no opportunity of knowing that a rupture is fallen out, they ſailed under a ſecurity of peace, and under the faith of treaties. By a parity of reaſoning, the ſhips not actually in thoſe ports ought to enjoy the ſame ſecurity; elſe, as they are included in the ſame parity of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, it would follow, contrary to the principals of humanity and right reaſon, that the ſovereigns had provided for the preſervation of one part of their ſubjects from the miſeries of a ſudden rupture, to which they expoſe the reſt. The particular conventions of theſe treaties, they ſaid, had their foundation in general equity and the law of nations; ſince, as it is impracticable for belligerent ſtates to agree amongſt themſelves which is the agreſſor, it is proper that the ſubjects ſhould receive previous notice of the rupture, in order that they may be able diſtinctly to know when they are, or are not in ſecurity, or when they may, or may not rely on the treaties which ſubſiſt between their ſovereigns.</p>
                        <p>Theſe topics were as uſual, bandied to and fro with great
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:1261701201:466"/>
heat and little effect; and as in ſuch diſcuſſions the arguments on both ſides are plauſible, and there can be no authoriſed judge, the weight of the ſeveral pretenſions commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the power of the parties to enforce them. On theſe two points, therefore, the renunciation of German alliances, and the reſtitution of captures, the negotiation from the beginning was at a ſtand; and on theſe at length to all appearance, it finally broke off.</p>
                        <p>Not but we are fully ſatisfied that the diſagreement even on theſe points might have been only the oſtenſible cauſe of the rupture. The true cauſe of the breach ſeems to have been the unſeaſonable interpoſition of the Spaniſh claims. For could France be ſuppoſed in good earneſt to deſire peace, that is, to deſire ſuch a reaſonable peace, as her circumſtances might demand, when ſhe officiouſly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with our particular debate, the affairs of a foreign and neutral power, which had not the ſmalleſt connection with thoſe that were at this time properly under delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? It was ridiculous to urge, that this was done from a prudent foreſight, and to prevent a future war, which theſe diſputes might poſſibly occaſion. The buſineſs was to put an end to the war which then actually ſubſiſted; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be farther from aſſiſting this deſign than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the ſubjects of debate. France muſt be ſenſible of the weight of this argument, who herſelf propoſed in the very beginning of this treaty, as means almoſt neceſſary for carrying it on with effect, that their particular diſpute ſhould be ſeparated from thoſe of their German allies, with which it certainly had a more natural connexion than with thoſe that ſubſiſted between England and Spain; as all the former parties were then engaged directly or indirectly in the war, to which Spain had then no manner of relation.</p>
                        <p>The Engliſh miniſtry finding the French immoveable on the two capital points above mentioned and having no opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ſincerity of their procedure, ſent directions to Mr. Stanly, to return to England, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that Mr. Buſſy ſhould on the part of his court, receive the ſame orders.

 An end was thus put to this negotiation, (from which Europe had conceived ſuch ſanguine hopes of the alleviation of its miſeries) after it had continued near ſix months. So far indeed it was from producing the happy effects that were propoſed from it, ſo far was it from appeaſing the animoſities of the powers ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:1261701201:467"/>
engaged, or from extinguiſhing the old war, that the parties ſeperated with intention more hoſtile, and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions more adverſe than ever; and the war was ſoon ſpread to a much greater extent by the taking in of a new party, and may poſſibly ſpread, ſtill more widely, by laying open new ſources of contention which may gradually draw in other powers, and finally involve every part of Europe. It was alſo a means of producing changes in England, which at a time of leſs tranquility, and in circumſtances of leſs internal ſtrength might have been productive of the moſt fatal conſequences. But theſe matters are reſerved for the ſubject of the enſuing chapter.</p>
                        <p>The leading negotiation in London and Paris being thus broken off, that which was propoſed at Augſburg never took place.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>AS nothing could have been more unprecedented, ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more alarming than the proceeding of the court of Spain in the negotiation. It was altogether extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary to ſee a propoſal for accommodating diſputes that ſubſiſted between friends coming thro' the channel of an enemy. It was extremely ſingular to ſee points of ſuch conſequence formally communicated and propoſed for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation by a French agent, commiſſioned only to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate a particular and diſtinct buſineſs, when the Spaniards had an ambaſſador reſiding in London, from whom no ſort of intimation had been previouſly received of ſuch a deſign.</p>
                        <p>That propoſal not only marked out a want of ſincerity on the part of France, but it manifeſted ſo ſtrange and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular a partiality on the part of Spain, that it would very little have become the dignity of the king of Great Britain, or his attention to the ſafety of his ſubjects, to let it paſs without a full and ſatisfactory explanation. Accordingly the Spaniſh ambaſſador was called upon to diſavow this ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular procedure; but he returned a verbal, and ſoon after was authoriſed by his court to return a written anſwer, in
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:1261701201:468"/>
which he openly avowed and juſtified the ſtep taken by the French agent, as entirely agreeable to the ſentiments of his maſter. He declared that the kings of France and Spain were united not only by ties of blood, but by a mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. He applauded the humanity and greatneſs of mind which his moſt Chriſtian majeſty demonſtrated in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that was complained of. He inſiſted much on the ſincere deſire of peace, the only motive which influenced the conduct of the two monarchs; and he added, haughtily, that if his maſter had been governed by any other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<q>His Catholic majeſty giving full ſcope to his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would have ſpoken from himſelf, and as became his dignity.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>It appeared evidently from the whole of this paper, that the court of Spain was regularly, as a fort of party, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed of every ſtep that was taken in the negotiation; that her judgment was appealed to upon every point, and her authority called in aid to force the acceptance of the terms which were offered by France; in a word, that there was a perfect union of affections, intereſts, and councils between theſe two courts; and the miniſter of the former, ſo far from denying or palliating this conduct, ſeemed to glory in it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pitt who then took the lead in the miniſtry, was fully ſatisfied the intentions of Spain were by no means equivocal, and that this partiality, which they ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avowed not only by declarations, but by facts, would drive them into all the meaſures of France. That a war on that account was abſolutely inevitable; and if, for the preſent moment, the Spaniards rather delayed their declaration of war, than laid aſide their hoſtile inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it was in order to ſtrike the blow at their own time, and with the greater effect; that therefore their reaſons for delaying to act were the very motives, which ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to act with the utmoſt ſpeed, and utmoſt vigour. That we ought to conſider the evaſions of that court as a refuſal of ſatisfaction, and that refuſal, as a declaration of war. That we ought from prudence as well as from ſpirit to ſecure ourſelves the firſt blow; and to be practically convinced, that the early and effective meaſures, which had ſo large a ſhare in reducing France to this dependence upon Spain, would alſo be the fitteſt for deterring or diſabling Spain from affording any protection to France. That, to
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:1261701201:469"/>
carry on this war with vigour, it was only neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue our preſent efforts; no new armament would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and that if any war could provide its own reſources, it muſt be a war with Spain. That their flota had not yet arrived, and that the taking of it, would at once diſable theirs and ſtrengthen our hands. This procedure ſo ſuited to the dignity of the nation, and the inſults it had received, would be a leſſon to Spain, and to every other power, how they ſhould preſume to dictate in our affairs, and to intermeddle with a menacing mediation, and an officiouſneſs as inſidious as it was audacious. That he would allow our enemies, whether ſecret or declared, no time to think and recollect themſelves.</p>
                        <p>Theſe ſentiments, ſo agreeable to the reſolute and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing character of this miniſter, appeared ſhocking to almoſt all the reſt of his collegues. They admitted that we ought not to be terrified from the aſſertions of our juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, by the menaces of any power. They owned that Spain had taken a very extraordinary and very unjuſtifiable ſtep; but that we ought to admit and even to wiſh for, an explanation; this court upon a ſober yet ſpirited remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, might recall that raſh propoſition into which they had been perhaps unwarily ſeduced by the artifices of France; that to ſhun war upon a juſt occaſion was coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, but to provoke or court it was madneſs. And, if to court a war was not in general a very wiſe meaſure, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it with Spain, if poſſibly it could be avoided, was to overturn the moſt fundamental principles of the policy of both nations. That this deſire of adding war to war, and enemy to enemy, whilſt we had our hands already as full as they could hold, and whilſt all our faculties were ſtrained to the utmoſt pitch, was ill to calculate the national ſtrength of our country, which, however great, had its limits, and was not able to contend with all the world; that whilſt we were calling for new enemies, no motion was made of new allies, nor indeed of any new reſource whatſoever. To plunge into ſuch meaſures, in the manner propoſed, and upon no better grounds, could not fail to ſcandalize and alarm all Europe; and we could poſſibly derive no advantage from this precipitate conduct, which would not be more than counter-balanced by the jealouſy and terror it would neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily create in every nation near us. As to the ſeizure of the flota, it was not to be reckoned upon, as at the very
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:1261701201:470"/>
time of that deliberation it might be expected to be ſafe in its harbour; and perhaps if we could ſucceed in ſeizing it, we might perform a ſervice not very agreeable to neutral nations, and as little advantageous to our own commerce. If Spain, blind to her true intereſts, and miſled by French councils, ſhould give in a more deciſive manner into the deſigns of that court, and obſtinately refuſe a reaſonable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, it would be then the true time to declare war, when all the neighbouring and impartial powers were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that we acted with as much temper as reſolution, and when every thinking man at home ſhould be ſatisfied that he was not hurried into the hazards and expences of war, from an idea of chimerical heroiſm, but from inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table neceſſity; and that in ſuch a caſe we might depend upon the utmoſt ſupport which the nation could give to an adminiſtration that depended upon its ſtrength, and yet dreaded to waſte it wantonly, or to employ it unjuſtly. The miniſter warmed by this oppoſition, declared that,
<q>This was the time for humbling the whole Houſe of Bourbon; that if this opportunity was let ſlip, it might never be recovered; and if he could not prevail in this inſtance, he was reſolved that this was the laſt time he would ſit in that council. He thanked the miniſters of the late king for their ſupport; ſaid he was himſelf called to the miniſtry by the voice of the people, to whom he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf as accountable for his conduct; and that he would no longer remain in a ſituation which made him reſponſible for meaſures he was no longer allowed to guide.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The noble lord, who precided in this council, to whom years have added the wiſdom of experience, without abat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vigour and fire of youth; and who was himſelf as bold a miniſter as ever directed the affairs of this nation, made him this reply:
<q>I find the gentleman is determined to leave us, nor can I ſay I am ſorry for it, ſince he would otherwiſe have certainly compelled us to leave him; but, if he be reſolved to aſſume the right of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing his majeſty, and directing the operations of the war, to what purpoſes are we called to this council? When he talks of being reſponſible to the people, he talks the language of the houſe of commons, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, that at this board, he is only reſponſible to the king. However, though he may poſſibly have convinced
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:1261701201:471"/>
himſelf of his infallibility, ſtill it remains that we ſhould be equally convinced before we can reſign our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his direction, or join with him in the meaſure be propoſes.</q>

                        <p>On the diviſion, the miniſter himſelf, and a noble lord cloſely connected with him, were the only voices in favour of the immediate declaration of war; the reſt of the board were unanimouſly againſt it.</p>
                        <p>The reader will obſerve that together with thoſe matters, which have been publiſhed, relative to this very important deliberation, with ſome appearance of authenticity, we have added ſuch arguments as have been agitated among the people; a liberty neceſſary to place the matter in its full light.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pitt and lord Temple, adhering to their firſt opinion, and having delivered their reaſons in writing, reſigned their employments. This reſignation ſeemed equal to a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſtate. An univerſal alarm was ſpread; a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand rumours flew abroad, and the firſt ſuggeſtions were, that this great miniſter, endeavouring to avail himſelf by his firmneſs in negotiation of the advantages he had acquired
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:1261701201:472"/>
by his vigour in war, was oppoſed by the whole council, who were reſolved to have a peace at any rate, and that this oppoſition had driven him to reſign the ſeals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the true cauſe of the reſignation very ſoon came out; and on this point a violent conflict enſued, in which the popular cauſe was worſe ſuſtained, and the miniſterial better, (that is, with greater effect) than is uſual in ſuch diſcuſſions. Some circumſtances contributed not a little to this ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. Pitt reſigned the ſeals, the great perſon to whom they were delivered received them with eaſe and firmneſs, without requeſting that he ſhould reſume his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. His majeſty expreſſed his concern for the loſs of ſo able a ſervant; and to ſhew the favourable ſenſe he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of his ſervices, he made him a moſt gracious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited offer of any rewards in the power of the crown to beſtow. His majeſty at the ſame time expreſſed himſelf not only ſatisfied with the opinion of the majority of his council, but declared he would have found himſelf under the greateſt difficulty how to have acted, had that council concurred as fully in ſupporting the meaſure propoſed by Mr. Pitt, as they had done in rejecting it. A ſentiment (in the light in which his majeſty conſidered this meaſure) grounded upon the firmeſt principles of integrity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and which muſt raiſe the higheſt veneration for his royal character not only among his own ſubjects, but amongſt all nations, when they ſee a power which has ſo little to fear from any human effort, ſo very fearful of the leaſt infringement of the ſtricteſt and moſt critical rules of juſtice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pitt was ſenſibly touched with the grandeur and condeſcenſion of this proceeding. 'I confeſs, Sir, I had but too much reaſon to expect your majeſty's diſpleaſure. I did not come prepared for this exceeding goodneſs. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, Sir,—it overpowers, it oppreſſes me.' He burſt into tears.</p>
                        <p>We are far from an attempt to add any colouring to ſo exquiſitely affecting a picture. We are indeed far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to do juſtice to perhaps one of the moſt pathetic and elevated ſcenes which could poſſibly be diſplayed, the parting of ſuch a prince, and ſuch a miniſter.</p>
                        <p>The next day a penſion of three thouſand pounds a year was ſettled on Mr. Pitt for three lives, and at the ſame time a title was conferred upon his lady and her iſſue; a penſion
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:1261701201:473"/>
the beſt beſtowed, and a nobility the moſt honourably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and moſt truly merited. Immediately the Gazette gave notice to the public of all theſe tranſactions. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation made the firſt article; the honours and rewards the next; and they were followed by a letter from our am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador in Spain, containing an account of the favourable and pacific language of that court, and of the ſtrong aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances they gave of a deſire to accommodate all differences in an amicable manner.</p>
                        <p>It muſt be owned that this manoeuvre was very ſkilfully executed. For it at once gave the people to underſtand the true motive to the reſignation; the inſufficiency of that motive, and the graciouſneſs of the king notwithſtanding the abrupt departure of his miniſter. If after this the late miniſter ſhould chuſe to enter into oppoſition, he muſt go into it loaded and oppreſſed with the imputation of the blackeſt ingratitude; if on the other hand he ſhould retire from buſineſs, or ſhould concur in ſupport of that adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration which he had left, becauſe he diſapproved its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, his acquieſcence would be attributed by the multitude to a bargain for his forſaking the public, and that the title and the penſion were the conſiderations.</p>
                        <p>Theſe were the barriers that were oppoſed againſt that torrent of popular rage, which it was apprehended would proceed from this reſignation. And the truth is, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered their end perfectly: This torrent for ſome time was beaten back, almoſt diverted into an oppoſite courſe; and when afterwards it returned to thoſe objects, againſt which it was originally directed, and where it was moſt dreaded, it was no longer that impetuous and irreſiſtible tide, which in the year 1757 had borne down every thing before it; it was weakened, divided, and ineffective.</p>
                        <p>On this occaſion the clamours and inferior members of each party went lengths, which undoubtedly were neither authoriſed nor approved by their leaders. The friends of Mr. Pitt raiſed the moſt violent clamours for diſplacing a miniſter, whoſe meaſures had raiſed the nation from the moſt abject ſtate, to the higheſt pinacle of glory. They ſaid, that
<q>he was in fact diſplaced, when he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to reſign, by not being ſuffered to carry into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution thoſe meaſures which he knew to be neceſſary to the honour and ſafety of his country. That the check which this miniſter had received, would moſt unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:1261701201:474"/>
revive the drooping hopes of France, ſunk by the vigour of our military operations, and the firmneſs of our councils under his adminiſtration, and would ſhew Spain with what impunity ſhe might inſult the honour of the Britiſh crown, and violate the property of its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. They reckoned up the diſgraces which the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had ſuffered before Mr. Pitt had entered into the management of affairs, and the victories and conqueſts which were the fruit of his councils.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>In conſequence of theſe reaſonings, addreſſes, reſolutions and inſtructions were ſet on foot in the great corporations; and it was believed that the example would be followed, as on a former occaſion of the ſame kind, by all the other ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and boroughs of the kingdom. But the progreſs of this meaſure, though commenced with much alacrity, was ſlow and languid: a few only of the corporations entered into it, and ſome even of theſe few in a manner leſs warm than was expected. A ſtrenuous defence was made on the part of the remaining miniſtry.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Was it ever heard, ſaid they, that a ſovereign has been cenſured for liſtening to the whole body of his council, in preference to the particular opinions of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle man? On the contrary, this uncontrouled ſway of a ſingle miniſter has been often thought dangerous, and was always odious in our free conſtitution; and is the more juſtly to be diſliked, as perhaps inconſiſtent with the true ſpirit, either of abſolute monarchy, or of limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted government. Let the merit of this miniſter be what it will, ſhall his maſter therefore be forced to receive him upon any terms? Muſt his prince, to gratify his ambitious views, or if you pleaſe, his virtuous intentions, diſmiſs his whole council, and annihilate his prerogative as a king, his reaſon and judgment as a man? Was it ever heard before, that a counſellor has profeſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſerve or any maſk, that becauſe he could not guide in government, he would not co-operate? This has unqueſtionably been the true motive for the conduct of many miniſters, but never was the avowed motive until this occaſion. Mr. Pitt has had the freeſt ſcope for the exertion of his genius; he was, perhaps, the only Engliſh miniſter that never met with the ſlighteſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; he has had the treaſures and the forces of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at his moſt abſolute command; let him, in his turn,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:1261701201:475"/>
do that juſtice that has been done to him; let him if the favours of the crown conſtitute no obligation, be bound at leaſt by the rules of equity; and if he will not partake in the conduct of the preſent moſt intricate and difficult buſineſs of adminiſtration, let him not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſtill more intricate and more difficult by his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and let him not ſtudy to find a juſtification of his meaſures, from the ill ſucceſs of thoſe whom he has left, when that ill ſuceſs will be owing to his own devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus far the points ſeem to have been urged with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and weight. A torrent, however, of low and illibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral abuſe was alſo poured out on this occaſion

                                    <p>FINDING, to my great ſurprize, that the cauſe and manner of my reſigning the ſeals, is groſly miſrepreſented in the city, as well as that the moſt gracious and ſpontaneous marks of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's approbation of my ſervices, which marks followed my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, have been infamouſly traduced as a bargain for my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the public, I am under a neceſſity of declaring the truth of both theſe facts, in a manner which I am ſure no gentleman will contradict; a difference of opinion with regard to meaſures to be taken againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> of the higheſt importance to the honour of the crown, and to the moſt eſſential national intereſts, (and this founded on what <hi>Spain</hi> had already done, not on what that court may farther intend to do) was the cauſe of my reſigning the ſeals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lord Temple and I ſubmitted in writing, and ſigned by us, our moſt humble ſentiments to his majeſty, which being over-ruled by the united opinion of all the reſt of the king's ſervants, I reſigned the ſeals on Monday the 5th of this month, in order not to remain reſponſible for meaſures, which I was no longer allowed to guide. Moſt gracious public marks of his majeſty's approbation of my ſervices followed my reſignation: They are unmerited and unſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited; and I ſhall ever he proud to have received them from the beſt of ſovereigns.</p>
                                    <p>I will now only add, my dear Sir, that I have explained theſe matters only for the honour of truth, not in any view to court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of confidence from any man, who with a credulity, as weak as it is injurous, has thought fit haſtily to withdraw his good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from one who ſerved his country with fidelity and ſucceſs; and who juſtly reveres the upright and candid judgment of it; little ſolicitous about the cenſures of the capricious and ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: Accept my ſincereſt acknowledgments for all your kind friendſhip, and believe me ever with truth and eſteem,</p>

whole life, public and private, was ſcrutinized with the utmoſt malignity, to furniſh matter of calumny againſt him.</p>
                        <p>The ſucceſſes of his adminiſtration were depreciated; his faults were monſtrouſly exaggerated, and the rewards and honours ſo juſtly conferred on him by his ſovereign, were by every trick of wit, ridicule, and buffoonery, converted into matter of degradation and diſgrace.</p>
                        <p>Without preſuming to take any part in a controverſy, which (however unequally) divided the royal council, or without entering into the ſentiments of any faction, which we have always ſhunned, we may affirm with truth and impartiality, that no man was ever better fitted than Mr. Pitt, to be the miniſter in a great and powerful nation, or better qualified to carry that power and greatneſs to their utmoſt limits. There was in all his deſigns a magnitude, and even a vaſtneſs, which was not eaſily comprehended by every mind, and which nothing but ſucceſs could have made to appear reaſonable. If he was ſometimes incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect he was never vulgar.</p>
                        <p>His power, as it was not acquired, ſo neither was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in an ordinary manner. With very little parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and with leſs court influence, he ſwayed both at court and in parliament with an authority unknown before, to the beſt ſupported miniſters. He was called to the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by the voice of the people; and what is more rare, he held it with that approbation; and under him for the firſt time, adminiſtration and popularity were ſeen united. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him Great Britain carried on the moſt important war in which ſhe ever was engaged, alone and unaſſiſted, with greater ſplendour, and with more ſucceſs than ſhe had ever enjoyed at the head of the moſt powerful alliances. Alone this iſland ſeemed to ballance the reſt of Europe.</p>
                        <p>In the conduct of the war he never ſuffered the enemy to
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:1261701201:478"/>
breathe, but overwhelmed them with re-iterated blows, and kept up the alarm in every quarter. If one of his expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was not ſo well calculated or ſo ſucceſsfully executed, amends were made by another, and by a third. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the nation once rouſed, was not ſuffered for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſubſide; and the French, dazzled, as it were, by the multitude and celerity of his enterprizes, ſeemed to have loſt all power of reſiſtance. In ſhort, he revived the military genius of our people; he ſupported our allies; he extended our trade; he raiſed our reputation; he augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our dominions; and on his departure from adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, left the nation in no other danger than that which ever muſt attend exorbitant power, and the temptation which may be, to the invidious exertion of it. Happy it had been for him, for his ſovereign, and his country, if a temper leſs auſtere, and a diſpoſition more practicable, more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant, and conciliating, had been joined to his other great virtues. The want of theſe qualities diſabled him from act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any otherwiſe than alone: it prevented our enjoying the joint fruit of the wiſdom of many able men, who might mutually have tempered, and mutually forwarded each other; and finally, which was not the meaneſt loſs, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived us of his own immediate ſervices.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe who cenſured his political conduct the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, could raiſe but few exceptions to it; none of them ſingly and perhaps, the whole united, of no great weight againſt a perſon long engaged in ſo great a ſcene of action.</p>
                        <p>Whether the part, which under his adminiſtration we rather continued to act than newly took, with regard to the affairs of Germany, be for the real intereſt of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, is a queſtion of the utmoſt difficulty, and which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will never admit a ſatisfactory ſolution. To condemn him on this head we muſt be ſure of this ſolution. It has been obſerved in favour of that conteſted meaſure, that France demonſtrated, through the whole progreſs of the late treaty, the moſt earneſt deſire, that we ſhould abandon the German connection; no trifling argument, that our enemy did not look upon it to be extremely prejudicial to our intereſts. If he has carried on that war at a vaſt expence, a prodigious ſtand has been made againſt the intire power of France; had leſs been expended, the whole expence might have been loſt. How far this part of his conduct was agreeable to his former declarations, is a diſcuſſion which
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:1261701201:479"/>
can avail but little. He found the nation engaged in theſe affairs; it was more eaſy to puſh them forward, than to extricate himſelf from them; as he proceeded, he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by experience the advantages of that plan of action, and his opinion was changed.</p>
                        <p>But even admitting, that, to attain the ends of oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he had once fallen upon popular topics, which even then he knew were not tenable, it can form but a very ſmall blemiſh in a public character, however wrong it may be by application to the ſtricteſt rules of morality. Ill would it fare with ſtateſmen if this ſort of conſiſtency were to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the moſt conſiſtent of them.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the penſion and title, it is a ſhame that any defence ſhould be neceſſary. What eye cannot diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, at the firſt glance, the difference between this and the exceptionable caſe of titles and penſions? What Briton, with the ſmalleſt ſenſe of honour and gratitude, but muſt bluſh for his country, if ſuch a man retired unrewarded from the public ſervice, let the motives to that retirement be what they would? It was not poſſible that his ſovereign could let his eminent ſervices paſs unrequited; the ſum that was given was undoubtedly inadequate to his merits; and the quantum was rather regulated by the moderation of the great mind that received it, than by the liberality of that which beſtowed it.</p>
                        <p>The conduct of Mr. Pitt when the parliament met, in which he made his own juſtification, without impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conduct of any of his colleagues, or taking one mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that might ſeem to ariſe from diſguſt or oppoſition, has ſet a ſeal upon his character.</p>
                        <p>Lord Egremont was appointed to ſucceed him as Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary for the ſouthern department.</p>

                           <p>Diſpute with Spain. Repreſentation of the earl of Briſtol. Diſpoſition of the court of Madrid. Treaty between France and Spain. England deſires a communication. Court of Spain refuſes. The miniſters mutually withdraw. A rupture.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE unfortunate intervention of Spain in the late ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, raiſed ſo many difficulties, and created ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           <pb n="424" facs="tcp:1261701201:480"/>
much miſchief both abroad and at home, that it becomes an aera in this hiſtory, and it is neceſſary we ſhould purſue that object from the point at which we left it, to its final and fatal determination.</p>
                        <p>The anſwer which had been received from the Spaniſh miniſter in London was far from being ſatisfactory to our court. Orders were immediately given to the earl of Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol, our ambaſſador in Spain, to remonſtrate with energy and firmneſs on ſo extraordinary a proceeding; to adhere to the negative put upon the Spaniſh pretenſions to fiſh at Newfoundland; to reſt the article of diſputed captures, on the juſtice of our tribunals; to continue the former profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of our deſire of an amicable adjuſtment of the log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood diſpute; and of our willingneſs to cauſe the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the coaſt of Honduras to be evacuated, as ſoon as ever his Catholick majeſty ſhould ſuggeſt a method for our enjoyment of that traffic to which we had a right by treaty, and which was further confirmed to us by repeated promiſes from that court.</p>
                        <p>At the ſame time that the earl of Briſtol was authoriſed to proceed with that ſpirit, which the offended dignity of our court required, and to bring Spain to a categorical and ſatisfactory declaration, concerning her final intentions; yet if he perceived on her part any intention to diſavow or even to explain away this offenſive tranſaction, he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to accept it, and to afford to that court as handſome a retreat as poſſible. The letter which conveyed theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions was written by Mr. Pitt, and dated on the 28th of July, a few days after the fatal memorial had been deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. Buſſy.</p>
                        <p>The earl of Briſtol punctually obeyed thoſe orders. He found General Wall, the Spaniſh miniſter, much in cold blood, and in very equivocal diſpoſitions. He heard with great patience the proper and energetic repreſentation that had been very ably made by the earl of Briſtol. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded the king of Great Britain's magnanimity in not ſuffering France as a tribunal, to be appealed to in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes with Spain; and declared, that in the propoſition which had been made with the conſent of his court, things were not conſidered in that light; aſked whether it could be imagined in England, that the Catholic king was ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to provoke us in our preſent moſt flouriſhing and moſt exalted ſituation, and after ſuch a ſeries of proſperous events
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:1261701201:481"/>
as no ſingle nation had ever met with? He valued, and reciprocally returned, our frequent profeſſions of friendſhip and our deſire of amicable adjuſtment. But theſe favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demonſtrations were accompanied with ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that had a very menacing appearance. For in the firſt place, he declared that at that time the utmoſt harmony ſubſiſted between the courts of France and Spain; that in conſequence of their perfect agreement, there was a mutual unreſerved communication of every ſtep taken in their ſeveral negotiations with England; that France had even offered to aſſiſt Spain, in caſe the diſcuſſions ſhe had with us ſhould grow into a rupture; and that this offer was conſidered in a friendly light. Such an intimate union of a third power with one of the parties at war, forebodes no long duration to its friendſhip, or even to its neutrality with the other. If Spain juſtified the proceedings of France, and owned herſelf concerned in them, it was but one, and that a ſhort, ſtep, to a junction with her.</p>
                        <p>As to the three matters in diſpute, the Spaniſh miniſter reſolutely adhered to them all; and as to the laſt (that of the logwood) he obſerved, that Great Britain had offered them nothing, but what they had long ſince been tired of, treaty and negotiation; that this matter had been already fully diſcuſſed; and that on this head Spain had given the moſt convincing proofs of her deſire to be on the beſt terms with England; for in the beginning of this war, before England had grown terrible by her ſucceſſes, when their American governors had endeavoured to diſlodge the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh from ſome new eſtabliſhments on the coaſt of Hondu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, they had, at the complaint of our court, in order to take away all cauſe of miſtruſt, ordered the governor to deſiſt from ſo juſtifiable an enterprize. That on the offer of England on this occaſion to ſettle matters in an amicable manner, they chearfully agreed to that method. But that ſix years had elapſed without their receiving the leaſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. They even alleged that the Engliſh encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on their coaſts in that time increaſed.</p>
                        <p>In this manner the Spaniards vindicated the form and the matter of their proceeding: they ſhewed no ſort of diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to relax from their claims; but at the ſame time they no longer inſiſted on blending together the ſeveral diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and they profeſſed in general, though not very warm terms, a deſire of continuing in amity with us. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:1261701201:482"/>
to the matter in diſpute, the pretenſions of both pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſtood in this poſture throughout the whole diſcuſſion; except that they were urged with more or leſs aſperity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fluctuating diſpoſition of the court of Spain, which ſeemed to reſt upon no ſure and ſettled principals. There were probably two factions in her councils who as they alternately prevailed, changed the language and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Spaniſh miniſter. However, for ſome time the aſpect of things continued on the whole to be rather fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable; and even an expreſs declaration was at length made, that Spain had been, at no time, more intent on cultivating a good correſpondence with us. But ſtill the French intereſt ſilently gained ground at Madrid; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidental communications of that court with Spain; her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected moderation in the treaty; the dangerous greatneſs of England; the common intereſt of the houſe of Buorbon, every part of which muſt ſuffer, both in its dignity and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by allowing the principal of its branches to be pruned to the quick: theſe points were urged with continual ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation; and they aſſured the Spaniards that even the ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an alliance between the ſovereigns of the two nations, would intimidate England, already exhauſted by the war, and apprehenſive of loſing the valuable commerce ſhe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with Spain.</p>
                        <p>Theſe arguments and ſuggeſtions at length prevailed, and a treaty was ſigned between the two courts, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of which was to preſerve from oppreſſion, and to maintain the intereſts of the houſe of Bourbon. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance was of a nature the more dangerous, as it turned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on family not national intereſt, and becauſe not ſtating ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly its objects, it might be made juſt of what extent they pleaſed. We make no mention of any other treaty than this, of itſelf ſufficiently alarming, becauſe whatever ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions may be entertained,, there is no certainty that any other has been concluded between thoſe powers.</p>
                        <p>France had obtained in this treaty almoſt all that ſhe aimed at; by it ſhe entered into the cloſeſt connection with Spain; this connection did not indeed ſeem directly of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to conclude a breach with England; it led to it how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, almoſt inevitably. At firſt the whole tranſaction was kept a profound ſecret; the inferiority of the marine of Spain, and the precariouſneſs of their ſupplies from America, in caſe they came to a preſent rupture with England, obliged
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:1261701201:483"/>
them to this temporary reſerve. France took care that this treaty ſhould not tranſpire untill the negotiation was broken off; and Spain, whilſt ſhe was under theſe apprehenſions, exhibited thoſe occaſional proofs of a pacific diſpoſition, which we have juſt now ſeen. But as ſoon as France had loſt all hopes of concluding the negotiation in the manner ſhe had wiſhed, and had failed in the uſe ſhe made of the intervention of the claims of Spain, ſhe circulated with great induſtry a report, that Spain would immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt Great Britain, in conſequence of a treaty lately concluded among the Bourbon courts.</p>
                        <p>England found that thoſe boaſts of the French were too confidently made, and too generally believed, to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without foundation. In conſequence of theſe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, orders were ſent to Spain, to demand in the moſt moderate terms, but in a manner not to be evaded, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of this treaty, or at leaſt a diſavowal that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any thing to the prejudice of Great Britain. But before theſe orders could reach Spain, lord Briſtol had him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf received intelligence of the treaty, and of the hopes, which the French made no ſecret of their deriving from that ſource. He therefore thought himſelf under a neceſſity of deſiring ſatisfaction from the Spaniſh ſecretary of ſtate concerning it.</p>
                        <p>Upon this application there appeared on a ſudden ſuch a change in the countenance, language, and ſentiments of that miniſter, as indicated but too fully the juſtneſs of the ſuſpicions that were entertained. The Spaniſh flota was now ſafely arrived with a very rich cargo; the French arms had made a conſiderable progreſs in the king's electoral do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; the ſucceſs of the Imperial arms was no leſs ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the reaſons for their former ſhew of moderation no longer exiſted. They therefore gave a looſe to thoſe move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they had hitherto concealed. M. Wall, evad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a direct anſwer, entered into a long and bitter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, not only of the treatment which Spain had received from us, but of the haughtineſs of our late proceedings with France; that it was time for them to open their eyes, and not to ſuffer a neighbour, an ally, a relation, and a friend, any longer to run the riſque of receiving ſuch rigid laws as were preſcribed by an inſulting conqueror; that we were intoxicated with our ſucceſſes; and a continued ſeries of victories had elated us ſo far, as to make us reject the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:1261701201:484"/>
conceſſion offered by France. This refuſal made it evident that our deſign in ruining the French power, was the more eaſily to cruſh Spain; that we propoſed entirely to chaſe the French from all their colonies in America to have the eaſier taſk in ſeizing on the Spaniſh dominions in thoſe parts, thereby to ſatisfy to the utmoſt of our ambition, and to gratify our boundleſs thirſt of conqueſt; therefore he would himſelf be the man to adviſe the king of Spain, that ſince his dominions were to be overwhelmed, at leaſt that they ſhould be ſiezed with arms in his ſubjects hands, and not to continue the paſſive victim he had hitherto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the eyes of the world.</p>
                        <p>The Engliſh ambaſſador, though aſtoniſhed at ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary a change of ſtile, replied with coolneſs to the invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and with firmneſs to the menaces of the Spaniſh mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; he obviated the objections which had been made, and ſupported our pretenſions; after anſwering in the beſt manner to what M. Wall had urged, he returned to his firſt demand, an explanation concerning the treaty: as often as a direct anſwer was evaded, the ſame queſtion was again put; and at length the only reply was, that the king of Spain had thought proper to <hi>renew his family compact;</hi> and then Mr. Wall, as if he was gone farther than he was au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed, ſuddenly turned the diſcourſe, and no farther ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction could be obtained,</p>
                        <p>This revolution in the appearances of things in Spain, was too intereſting not to be immediately communicated. Our miniſtry ſaw evidently, that the moderation they had hitherto diſplayed, might be attributed to fear, and that the language of the court of Spain would permit no doubt of their hoſtile intenſions. Orders were therefore given to the earl of Briſtol, conformable to dignity of the nation, and the juſtice of our claim. He was ordered to renew his inſtances concerning the treaty; to demand an explanation with a proper firmneſs, but without the mixture of any thing which might irritate; and to ſignify, that a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory refuſal to communicate the treaty, or to diſavow an intention to take part with our enemies, would be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as an aggreſſion on the part of Spain, and an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute declaration of war.</p>
                        <p>Things were now brought to a ſingle and preciſe point. The demand was made in the terms of the order. Then it was that the pride of Spain entirely threw of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:1261701201:485"/>
of that maſk, which her policy had perſuaded her to aſſume; the ſecretary, M. Wall, replied,
<q>That the ſpirit of haughtineſs and of diſcord,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Dec. 10."/> 

 which dictated this inconſiderable ſtep, and which for the misfortune of mankind ſtill reigns ſo much in the Britiſh government, is what has made the declaration of war, and attacked the king's dignity; and that the Earl of Briſtol might return when and in what manner was convenient to him.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Earl of Briſtol parted from Madrid the 17th of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember; and thus was brought on a rupture which has prodigiouſly extended the operations, and conſequently the miſeries of war, and threatens to protect them to a very long duration. Europe unfortunately found herſelf plunged into the gulph of a new war, at the time ſhe hoped to emerge from the old one, and by the very means which were uſed to draw her out of it. A point of honour alone ſeemed to have been the laſt and immediate cauſe of the breach; but whoever has diligently attended to the Spaniſh affairs from the memorial preſented by Buſſy to the final anſwer delivered by Wall, will ſee that the motives were, however ill underſtood, of a much more ſerious and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant nature.</p>
                        <p>As the two powers had now come to extremities, and the Engliſh ambaſſador had departed from Madrid, the Spaniſh miniſter alſo quitted London; but before his departure he left a paper, in the nature of a manifeſto, of very little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in point of argument, but filled with invectives, charging the war on the haughtineſs of the late Engliſh miniſter, and on the little reſpect with which his court had been treated, both during the adminiſtration of that miniſter, and ſince his reſignation. That had the purport of the treaty been deſired in a manner leſs offenſive to the dignity of his maſter, it might as eaſily have been obtained, as it could have been juſtified; for the treaty, which was believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been ſigned on the 15th of Auguſt, contained only a reciprocal guaranty of the dominions of the ſeveral branches of the houſe of Bourbon, but with this particular reſtriction, that it ſhould only extend to the dominions which ſhall remain to France after the preſent war.</p>
                        <p>It muſt be remarked that, this paper, whilſt it pretends to ſet forth the purport of a treaty dated the 15th of Auguſt, does not deny the exiſtence of any other treaty, which

                        <p>AFTER the defeat of the French near Wandewaſh, the taking of the city of Arcot, and the reduction of the fortreſſes of Chitteput and Carrical, Pondicherry wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> the only ſpace of conſequence which remained to our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in India. This town, beautifully built, ſtrongly forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and four leagues in circuit, ſeemed rather the capital of a kingdom, than a trading eſtabliſhment. It is ſituated on the coaſt of Malabar, about forty miles from our ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Madraſs, which in the days of its proſperity it ri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>valled, if not exceeded in trade, opulence and ſplendor; and it ſtill remained the depoſitory of whatever wealth was left to the French, after the reverſe of their fortune in war.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as the fortreſſes adjacent to this important place had been reduced, and the inland country brought perfectly to our intereſts by the total expulſion of the French, the blockade of Pondicherry was commenced by the land forces under colonel Coote, and the marine under admiral Stevens. A regular ſiege was at that time impracticable on account of the periodical rains, which were daily expected; and even under more favourable circumſtances it would have proved a taſk of infinite difficulty to attempt any army that could be ſupported in India, the taking of a place ſo ſtrongly fortified, defended by a good garriſon, and by an officer able and reſolute, and whoſe pride and obſtinacy, ſo prejudicial on all other occaſions, would have made him, as in effect they did make him, perſevere to the very laſt moment, is
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:1261701201:487"/>
the defence of the laſt ſtake, which the French had left in India.</p>
                        <p>The blockade being therefore choſen as the moſt eligible for the time, was continued with the beſt diſpoſitions, and the moſt extraordinary patience on both ſides, for full ſeven months. In this time the garriſon and inhabitants ſuffered ſorely by famine. Col. Coote, in order to augment their diſtreſs, erected batteries at a diſtance, not with a view of ruining the walls, but to harraſs the enemy by an encreaſe of garriſon duty.</p>
                        <p>At length when the weather appeared ſettled, four batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were raiſed at ſome diſtance to enfilade the ſtreets of Pondicherry, whilſt others were advanced nearer in order to play upon the works. Theſe operations, though the ſiege was not yet formally undertaken, commenced on the 26th of November, 1760, but as the ſeaſon of the rains and winds was not yet quite over, much was ſuffered from ſtorms, which ruined the batteries and approaches. They were however always repaired with the utmoſt alacrity and ſpeed, and the ſiege ſuffered no intermiſſion. So that the beſieged, who eagerly expected the arrival of their fleet to their relief, were reduced to the moſt extreme diſtreſs. They lived on camels, elephants, dogs, and cats. The extreme ſcarcity and dearneſs even of this wretched proviſion, increaſed their miſery. Sixteen roupies (half crowns) had been paid for the fleſh of a dog.</p>
                        <p>In the midſt of this diſtreſs their hopes were ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and thoſe of the beſiegers, notwithſtanding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs they had made, almoſt totally depreſſed. On the firſt of January 1761, one of thoſe terrible ſtorms, ſo frequent in the Indian ſea, and ſo ruinous, drove the Engliſh ſquadron from before Pondicherry. Two ſhips of the line were wrecked, and their crews, with the exception of two or three men, entirely periſhed. Two others of the ſame claſs were driven aſhore, and beat to pieces. The men fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately eſcaped. The real damage which our fleet ſuſtained on this occaſion, together with the idea of a far greater, ſuggeſted by their own deſires, and juſtified by the violence of the ſtorm, elevated to the higheſt pitch the ſpirits of the garriſon, ſunk by diſeaſe, famine, fatigue, and an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted train of adverſe fortune.

, as it may tend to furniſh ſome idea of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of this ſingular man.</p>
                        <p>But admiral Stevens, and thoſe who commanded under him, exerting themſelves with unparalleled diligence and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity, appeared again before Pondicherry in leſs than four days after the ſtorm, with eleven ſhips of the line and one frigate, and the blockade was as compleat as ever. No ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours had been thrown in, and admiral Stevens in order to prevent the ill impreſſion which the late diſaſter might have occaſioned, ſent a meſſage to the neighbouring Dutch and Daniſh ſettlements, of the good condition and ſtrength of the remainder of his fleet, and aſſured them he would make prize of ſuch veſſels as he found infringing the neutrality by attempting to ſupply the enemy.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding this mortifying diſappointment, M. Lally made no propoſal to ſurrender. The ſiege was carried on with redoubled alacrity; and at length a large battery being advanced within four hundred and fifty yards of the rampart, a breach being effected, and not more than one
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:1261701201:489"/>
day's proviſion of any kind remaining, a ſignal was made for a ceſſation of arms; the principal of the Jeſuits, together with two Civilians came out, and offered terms of capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation. The governor preſerving all his haughtineſs, which neither his errors nor misfortunes could in the leaſt abate, declined to offer any terms;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Jan. 15."/> 

 he ſent out a paper full of invectives againſt the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, for the breach of treaties relative to India; he alledged that thoſe breaches diſqualified him from propoſing any terms; and in conſequence he rather ſuffered our troops to take poſſeſſion of the place, than formally ſurrender it. As the governor refuſed to capitulate, the propoſal of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants was little regarded, and the city of Pondicherry, with a garriſon of about fourteen hundred European ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, a vaſt quantity of military ſtores, and great riches, was given up at diſcretion to our victorious arms.</p>
                        <p>Nothing can be ſaid too highly of the conduct, perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and unanimity of the land and ſea ſervices during a tedious ſiege and blockade of eight months, in a climate ſo unfavourable to all military operations. Colonel Coote gave the final blow to the French power in India; he was now indiſputed maſter of the rich coaſt of Coromandel; the French power was wholly extirpated; the neutral nations were contemptible; the princes of the country conſidered us with an aweful regard, and nothing but a little French ſettlement on the coaſt of Malabar, called Mahie, (and which was ſoon after reduced) oppoſed our commanding the whole trade of that vaſt peninſula of India from the Ganges to the Indies, the moſt extenſive and profitable ſphere of commerce in the world.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt every thing was giving way to our arms in the ſouthern parts of this peninſula, the affairs of France, which in Bengal had been to all appearance totally ſuppreſſed, roſe up again for a moment from a quarter, and in a manner, which was little expected. After the taking of Chandena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gore by admiral Watſon in the year 1757, Mr. Law, (ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew to that Law who had made himſelf ſo well known by the Miſſiſippi ſcheme) put himſelf at the head of a party of French fugitives, which was augmented from time to time to about two hundred men. With this ſmall party he threw himſelf into the heart of the country, and joining himſelf ſometimes to one, ſometimes to another of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive princes, as his intereſt led him; he rendered himſelf
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:1261701201:490"/>
conſiderable by ſeveral ſtriking ſervices, and ſupported the credit of his little corps with a very high reputation.</p>
                        <p>The Great Mogul having ſome time ſince been depoſed by an irruption of the Marrattas, and dying ſoon after, one of his ſons, Sha Zaddah, aſſumed the title, and was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by ſome of the provinces of that extenſive and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united empire; he was oppoſed by others; and though he was at the head of a royal army of his native ſubjects, ſuch is the ſtate of the military in that part of the world, that he conſidered an handful of European fugitives, as an acquiſition of the greateſt importance, and ſuch as might turn the ballance againſt any weight of Indians, which might be thrown into the oppoſite ſcale. In fact, it was to Mr. Law he attributed the reduction of ſeveral conſiderable provinces to his obedience.</p>
                        <p>Elated with theſe ſucceſſes, Law perſuaded him to turn his arms againſt Bengal, which had not acknowledged him; it was a rich and flouriſhing country, and the poſſeſſion of it, would undoubtedly contribute more than all the reſt to ſet him on the throne of the Moguls. Here, unfortunately for him the evil genius of Law impelled him to encounter again with thoſe arms, by which the intereſt of his country had been before ruined in this part of the world, and which indeed were thoſe only, from which he had a great deal to fear. Sha Zaddah entered the kingdom of Bengal at the head of an army of 80,000 Indians and ſomething more than 200 French.</p>
                        <p>The French ſupport was more prejudicial to his title in the eyes of the Engliſh, than any other objection, and as they were now become the arbiters of crowns in the Eaſt, they joined the Nabob of Bengal to oppoſe his progreſs. About 20,000 blacks ſupported by 500 Engliſh ſoldiers, formed the army againſt him. A major (major Carnac) commanded that body, which engaged, and totally routed an army of fourſcore thouſand men, commanded by the Mogul in perſon. That prince was taken priſoner; Mr. Law was alſo taken, and the party of French adventurers diſperſed for ever. It is not yet known with certainty, in what manner they mean to diſpoſe of their captive monarch. It was ſome heightening to the ſatisfaction of this great event, that it happened on the ſame day in which the French agreed to the ſurrender of Pondicherry.</p>
                        <p>A little before this, Jaffier Ali Cawn, the Nabob who,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:1261701201:491"/>
in 1757, had been placed in that dignity by general Clive, notwithſtanding the terrifying example of his predeceſſor, by his weakneſs and miſgovernment, drew on himſelf the hatred of his ſubjects, and loſt the protection of the Engliſh. But as his ambition was the feebleſt of his paſſions, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented quietly to quit the throne. The revolution was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected without bloodſhed, his ſon-in-law was appointed in his room; and as the whole tranſaction was with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and co-operation of the Engliſh governor Vanſittart, the old privileges of the company were confirmed, and new were acquired: the Engliſh in Bengal were become neceſſary to the government of that country, and every change pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſomething to their advantage.</p>
                        <p>It is certain, that the period of this war in the Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, has been marked by as many ſtriking events, uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon circumſtances, and ſingular reverſes of fortune, as any that have happened from the time of our knowledge of this part of the world.</p>
                        <p>It can hardly be ſaid, that this ſeries of proſperity was interrupted by the ſucceſsful attempts of the count d'Eſtaign. This lively adventurer, with the command of no more than two ordinary frigates, had in October 1759, taken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Engliſh ſettlement of Bender-Abaſſi, on the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian gulph; he then ſtruck over to the iſland of Sumatra, where we carry on our moſt conſiderable commerce in pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and before the end of the following April, reduced Bencoolen, the principal ſettlement, and all the reſt of our forts and factories on that iſland, which made a defence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as unworthy of the reſt of our conduct in India, as that of the count d'Eſtaign was ſuperior to the efforts of his countrymen in that quarter. This bold adventurer, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, could not derive ſo much honour from the vigour of his enterprize, as diſgrace from having made them againſt the moſt ſacred law of arms: if what is ſaid is true, that he was at the very time a priſoner upon parole.</p>
                        <p>In America the iſland of Dominica, one of thoſe iſlands called Neutral, but which the French had fortified and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, was reduced by a ſmall armament under lord Rollo and Sir James Douglas. North America was perfectly quieted by a peace with the Cherokees. Colonel Grant reduced them to this neceſſity, by penetrating with great courage and perſeverance into their country, and deſtroying fifteen of their towns, and almoſt their whole harveſt.</p>

                        <p>THE cloſe of the year 1761 left the affairs of all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, both military and political, in the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting ſituation, in which they have ſtood, at perhaps any period of our modern hiſtory. The endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which had been made to bring about peace amongſt the belligerent powers, ſerved only to increaſe their ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity.
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:1261701201:493"/>
And at the ſame time they brought into light and exertion, thoſe latent motives and diſpoſitions to war, which had long lurked in other powers under the veil of neutrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and had only been kept down ſometimes by irreſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of temper in perſons, and ſometimes by want of ſyſtem in politics. Theſe ineffectual endeavours for peace produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced alſo many occaſions of quarrel and debate, that were abſolutely new.</p>
                        <p>To the north there was no appearance of relenting in any one of the powers engaged. It was not to be expected, that the confederacy, which had held together ſo long, and under ſuch difficulties and diſappointments, ſhould now break to pieces, juſt at the moment when the ſtates which compoſed it ſeemed in a condition to reap the mature fruits of their unanimity and perſeverance. The king of Pruſſia was not in a ſtate either to allure or to intimidate. Great Britain could not increaſe his ſubſidy, nor reinforce his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The allied army in Weſtphalia played a defenſive, and, on the whole of the campaign, a loſing game; and there was nobody ſo ſanguine as to think that Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain could increaſe her ſtrength in Germany, where ſhe paid already 100,000 men, and expended five millions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</p>
                        <p>Although nothing ſeems more certain in a general view of the political ſyſtem, than that the king of Pruſſia is not the natural and neceſſary ally of this nation; yet his fortune neither was, ſince the beginning of the war, nor is it now a matter of indifference to us.</p>
                        <p>The late Mr. Shippin was of opinion, that the power of France was become an object of much leſs terror ſince the growth of the power of Ruſſia. But he never imagined it poſſible, that all the great continental powers of Europe ſhould ever be united with France; and that they ſhould conſpire to load her ſcale inſtead of ballancing it. He never could foreſee, what has actually happened in this war, that this very power of Ruſſia could co-operate with France, and even with Sweden; and what is full as extraordinary, that both theſe latter could co-operate with Auſtria to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy in effect the ſyſtem, which had been eſtabliſhed by the treaty of Weſtphalia; that ſyſtem, which it had been the great drift of policy, and the great object of war to both France and Sweden in the laſt century to eſtabliſh and
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:1261701201:494"/>
to confirm, and to the houſe of Auſtria conſtantly to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The deſtruction of the king of Pruſſia ſeemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the deſtruction of the treaty of Weſtphalia; becauſe he is the only power in the empire capable of aſſerting the independency of its members, and ſupporting the declining credit of the Proteſtant cauſe.</p>
                        <p>The total ruin of Saxony, with ſuch circumſtances of unpardonable cruelty by that prince himſelf, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted ſtate of all the other Proteſtant members of the empire, have narrowed that intereſt more and more to the ſingle object of Pruſſia. As this intereſt was firſt formed in the empire, ſo its condition there cannot fail of having the moſt ſenſible influence on all the potentates of the ſame communion. Even in this light, England had an intereſt that the king of Pruſſia ſhould not be entirely cruſhed by the prevalence of a combination compoſed in ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary a manner, that its ſucceſs muſt neceſſarily produce a total revolution in the ſyſtem of Europe, and draw on a ſeries of conſequences, which, though it is impoſſible to particularize, muſt have undoubtedly been of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and alarming nature.</p>
                        <p>But there was an intereſt yet nearer to us, the fate of our own army in Germany, which could not ſurvive the deſtruction of the king of Pruſſia for an hour. Theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances rendered the proſpect of the campaign in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many very gloomy; as there was no ſort of ground to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that this prince, upon whoſe fate ſo many important intereſts immediately depended, could hold out to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of ſummer. Beſides, Denmark ſhewed no favourable diſpoſitions towards us; and Holland diſcovered evident marks of coldneſs, if not of abſolute alienation. Such was the diſpoſition of the powers in the north.</p>
                        <p>The ſouthern powers of Europe, whoſe total inconnec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the cauſes, and whoſe great remoteneſs from the ſeat of war might appear ſufficient to enſure their tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, began to enter into action with a ſpirit equal to that of any of the parties, who had from the beginning acted as principals; new fewel was heaped upon the fire of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which had waſted ſo many nations, juſt as it ſeemed to be on the point of expiring.</p>
                        <p>That alliance between the branches of the houſe of Bourbon, of which we have ſpoken laſt year, and which is ſo well known by the name of the Family Compact, is one
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:1261701201:495"/>
of the moſt extraordinary tranſactions of this, or, perhaps, of any time, It has already produced ſome effects anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to its deſign; it may produce others ſtill more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; and on the whole muſt be conſidered as an event of the moſt extenſive, laſting, and alarming influence.</p>
                        <p>The treaty of Vienna in 1756, between France and Auſtria, has certainly contributed not a little to give that new turn to affairs, by which almoſt all the diſcourſes, that have hitherto been written on the intereſts of princes, are rendered erroneous, and of little uſe in future ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. That treaty, however, though it ſeems entirely to have disjointed the antient ſyſtem of alliance by which France was formerly counterpoiſed, may, poſſibly, not be ſo much a laſting change, as a temporary and excentric de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from the ſphere in which the houſe of Auſtria had formerly moved, and into which it ſeems ſo ſutiable to her natural and permanent intereſt to return. The Bourbon compact is of a different nature; and it ſeems to have at length produced that intire union between the French and Spaniſh monarchies, which was ſo much dreaded on the death of Charles II. and which it was the great purpoſe of the treaty of partition, and the war of the grand alliance to prevent. We have ſeen it take place in our days, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively with very little notice; ſo much greater is our preſent ſtrength; or ſo much greater was the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in thoſe days, than the danger of the actual event in the preſent.</p>
                        <p>It was a bold puſh in France to attempt, and an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſucceſs to procure, towards the cloſe of an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and diſgraceful war, an alliance of this kind. France could not have expected from the moſt fortunate iſſue of her affairs, an advantage ſo great as that which ſhe derived from her uncommon diſtreſſes. It is ſome time ſince the jealouſy of her power has began to abate. But in fact her ſecurity, and probably too her power, will be greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by this very circumſtance. Inſtead of forming ſuch an object as alarmed mankind, and againſt which all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope uſed to unite, ſhe is herſelf become the centre of an alliance, which extends from the northern to the ſouthern extemity of Europe; and ſhe was in this war, actually united with Ruſſia, Sweden, Auſtria, the Empire, Spain, and Naples; to ſay nothing of Denmark, with which ſhe had alſo ſome connections.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="440" facs="tcp:1261701201:496"/>With other nations, however, her ties are comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſlight: but the engagements of the Bourbon compact form rather an act of incorporation than an alliance. It contains ſtipulations hitherto unheard of in any treaty. By the 23d and 24th articles, the ſubjects of the ſeveral branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the houſe of Bourbon are admitted to a mutual natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralization, and to a participation of ſuch privileges and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, as if they were natural born ſubjects of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of their reſpective ſovereigns. The direct trade to America forms the only exception to this comprehenſive communitive of intereſts. The tenor of this article is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite conſequence to the general trading intereſt of Europe; all the ſtates of which, by the 25th article of the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, are excluded from any proſpect of obtaining ſimilar advantages.</p>
                        <p>This forms a civil union in almoſt the ſtricteſt ſenſe; the political union is even more perfect. By the 1ſt and 16th articles, the two monarchs of France and Spain agree to look upon every power as their enemy, which becomes an enemy of the other; that a war declared againſt either, ſhall be regarded as perſonal by the other; and that, when they happen to be both engaged in a war againſt the ſame enemy or enemies, they will wage it jointly with their whole forces; and that their military operations ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by common conſent and with a perfect agreement.</p>
                        <p>By the 26th article, they agree reciprocally to diſcloſe to each other their alliances and negotiations.</p>
                        <p>By the 17th and 18th, they formally engage not to make, or even to liſten, to any propoſal of peace from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemies, but by mutual conſent; being reſolved, in time of peace as well as in time of war, <hi>each mutually to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the intereſts of the allied crown as its own; to compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate their ſeveral loſſes and advantages, and to act as if the two monarchies formed only one and the ſame power.</hi> The king of the Sicilies, and the infant duke of Parma are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this treaty.</p>
                        <p>Here is the model of the moſt perfect confederacy. There is but one reſtriction to the extent of this ſcheme; but this particular reſtriction is a key to the whole treaty; as it ſhews, in the moſt ſatisfactory manner againſt what object it was principally directed. For by the 8th article it is provided, that Spain ſhall not be bound to ſuccour France, when ſhe is engaged in a war in conſequence of her engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:1261701201:497"/>
by the treaty of Weſtphalia, or other alliances with the princes and ſtates of Germany and the north, <hi>unleſs ſome maritime power takes part in thoſe wars,</hi> or France be attacked by land in her own country. This exception of the maritime powers indicates ſufficiently that the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of this article is to affect England, and ſerves to point out clearly, though obliquely, to the other powers of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, that their connection with England is the great cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which is to provoke the enmity of Spain.</p>
                        <p>It ſhould ſeem that this treaty alone, when once its true nature came to be diſcovered, if no other cauſe exiſted, would have been ſufficient to juſtify Great Britain in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of war againſt a monarchy, which had united it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſo intimate a manner with her enemy, that it was rendered impoſſible to diſtinguiſh the one from the other. In this point, however, prudence was to interpoſe, and circumſtances to direct. It was not therefore, untill eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry attempt to bring Spain to a clear declaration of pacific intentions had been tried without ſucceſs, in the manner ſhe have already ſeen, that war was actually declared againſt her. This declaration was made, on our part, in London, the 2d of January of the preſent year.</p>
                        <p>Since Great Britain was a kingdom, ſhe never was in ſuch a doubtful and dangerous ſituation; for at this time we was engaged, directly or indirectly, in a war, not only with all the great continental powers, but, what is more material, with the moſt conſiderable part of the maritime ſtrength of Europe. According to the ordinary computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the navy of Spain conſiſted of more than 100 men of war; and though the French navy was greatly reduced, it became of conſideration when added to the Spaniſh. Great efforts were made to render it reſpectable. Several communities in France engaged to fit out men of war at their own expence; and in general that whole people felt, after having been ſunk under a long deſpondency, a momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary glow of hope and animation from this alliance, ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful in its real ſtrength, and in its principals ſo flattering to the national vanity. The glory of their royal houſe, was, on this occaſion, united with the ſafety of their country. They were reinforced by the moſt cordial amity of a power untouched in its reſources of men, money, and ſtores; whilſt Great Britain was exhauſted of men by her many
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:1261701201:498"/>
victories, and her reſources were ſinking under a debt of more than one hundred millions.</p>
                        <p>Beſides a rude ſhock had been lately given to the ſyſtem of the Engliſh miniſtry, which might be ſuppoſed, in ſome degree, likely to affect public credit. The part which Mr. Pitt might finally take, and the conſequences which might reſult from his actions, were extremely undetermined; nor was it at all clear, what degree of harmony and real confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence continued amongſt the ſeveral parts of the ſubſiſting adminiſtration. All theſe conſiderations could not fail of inſpiring France with great confidence.</p>
                        <p>Great Britain, under theſe circumſtances, had, however, ſome things in her favour. The hope of plunder which always attends a Spaniſh war, diſpoſed the minds of many towards the preſent; and was ſure to call forth a very vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous exertion both of public and private ſtrength. This circumſtance alſo inſured the ſupplies.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the adminiſtration, their delay in entering into this Spaniſh war, contrary to the ideas of Mr. Pitt, his reſignation in conſequence of this delay; the neceſſity, which ſo ſoon after appeared, of engaging in hoſtilities, and which, to the bulk of the people, ſeemed to juſtify the ſentiments of that miniſter, together with a recollection of the ſingular ſpirit with which the French war had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, muſt neceſſarily have excited them to the moſt ſtrenous efforts, and to every act of laudable emulation. There was a neceſſity of ſhewing, that the ſpirit of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the wiſdom of its councils, were not confined to a ſingle man; and it was ſhewn effectually.</p>
                        <p>We had alſo, to ballance the great ſtrength derived from the extraordinary combination of our enemies, that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form tenor of ſucceſs on our ſide, which made our people believe themſelves invincible. This was not an unground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed preſumption, or a dream of enthuſiaſm; their juſt opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuperior courage, together with the ſolid experience derived from ſuch a variety of ſervices, and ſo many ſharp conflicts by ſea, and land, all combined to make our forces ſeem, and be, almoſt irreſiſtible.</p>
                        <p>Spain, on the other hand, had, in the very conſtitution of her power, an eſſential defect, which expoſed her on this, as upon all other occaſions. Her reſources, though very great, are not within herſelf; and conſequently are not always at her command, being ſubject not only to be
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:1261701201:499"/>
intercepted by the operations of the war, but to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed or loſt by the caſualty of long voyages; and, in every event, are liable to delay and diſappointment.</p>

                        <p>SUCH was our ſituation, both at home and abroad, at the breaking out of this new war. Something extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary was to be expected from the confederacy of the houſe of Bourbon. It was not, however, altogether cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain where the ſtorm, that was gathering, would fall. There were apprehenſions for the peace of Italy; Holland had ſome cauſe of dread; and menaces were uſed in that quarter. But Portugal ſeemed to be moſt endangered, on account of her cloſe and natural connection with Great Britain, her internal weakneſs, the antient claims of the Catholic king, and the opportunity of invaſion; that kingdom being on all ſides, except to the ſea, in a manner incloſed by Spain.</p>
                        <p>Public conjecture was not miſtaken in fixing upon Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal. No mention was made, indeed, of the Spaniſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to that crown; but a reſolution was taken not only to oblige her to renounce all friendſhip, but to violate her neutrality with Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>No attempt was ever deſigned with leſs appearance of juſtice; no propoſition was ever made with more arrogance and deſpotiſm to an independent ſovereign; and no ſcheme ſeemed, according to every human appearance, ſo certain of ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>The kingdom of Portugal, on the recovery of her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; which happened in the year 1640, found herſelf ſtripped of the greateſt part of thoſe acquiſitions, in both Indies, which had been the principal ſources of her power, and the great monuments of the captivity of her former kings and commanders.

ruins of her fortune, and others upon different but not leſs ſubſtantial foundations. though the Brazils were recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Goa and ſome other places in India remained ſtill to Portugal, her maritime power, and the ſhare of trade, on which it depended, were not recoverable. Contrary to the fate of other nations, who have ſhaken off a foreign do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, ſhe did not owe her liberty to great abilities. Whilſt the United Provinces were firſt freed, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards aggrandized, by the capacity of the princes of Orange, and whilſt Pruſſia, from an inconſiderable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent principality, grew into a formidable monarchy by the genuis of her ſovereigns, Portugal continued to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh in a ſtate of mediocrity. Without any ſymptoms of danger to her exiſtence, ſhe ſuffered a gradual decay of her power and conſideration. The character of her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was narrow and biggoted, and the whole ſyſtem of her commerce prepoſterous. If, on the one hand, a long peace added to the reſources of her revenue, it, on the other, abſolutely annihilated her military; and no country in the world had an army ſo complete in numbers, ſo ill furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with arms, ſo deficient in diſcipline, and ſo wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided of able and experienced officers.</p>
                        <p>In this condition ſhe ſuffered a fatal blow from the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake in 1756. The wealthy and flouriſhing city of Liſbon was laid level with the ground; near 30,000 of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants were buried in the ruins; and thoſe who remained, with the court itſelf, were reduced to the utmoſt diſtreſs and miſery.</p>
                        <p>As if this earthquake, which overturned their capital, had alſo ſhaken and deſtracted the frame of their government, and the temper of their minds, the moſt dreadful diſtempers broke out in the ſtate, A ſeries of horrid crimes, and of cruel puniſhments, ſucceeded to this calamity. The moſt noble and wealthy family of Portugal, having engaged it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a ſacrilegious attempt on the life of their ſovereign, was cut off at once, with little diſtinction of ſex or age, by a bloody and dreadful exertion of juſtice. Many others, who were accuſed or ſuſpected, ſuffered death, or exile, or impriſonment. Amongſt theſe, and from the ſame cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, one of the moſt conſiderable religious orders for wealth, influence, and policy, was ſtripped of its poſſeſſions, and intirely driven out of the country.</p>
                        <p>All theſe circumſtances left this unhappy kingdom in the
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:1261701201:503"/>
utmoſt weakneſs and confuſion. All thoſe, and they were not a few, who were attached by connection of blood or intereſt to the nobles that had ſuffered, or by religious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Jeſuits who had been expelled, could never be cordially relied upon by the crown, and were probably as little inclined to any extraordinary efforts in favour of a government, which their reſentments muſt have repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them as no better than a bloody tyranny.</p>
                        <p>The Bourbon confederacy had ſome ground to ſuppoſe that Portugal, in this ſituation, would not have courage to withſtand their menaces, and much leſs ability for any long time to reſiſt their efforts. The Spaniſh army overſpread the frontiers of Portugal; the commerce of corn between the two kingdoms was prohibited, and every thing threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened a ſudden invaſion. In the midſt of theſe hoſtile preparations,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Mar. 6."/> 

 the French and Spaniſh mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters presented a joint memorial to the court of Liſbon which was followed by ſeveral others. The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of theſe memorials was to perſuade his moſt faithful majeſty to enter into the alliance, and co-operate in the meaſures of the two crowns, againſt Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>It was not eaſy to find very convincing arguments to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Portugal to adopt ſo extraordinary a change of ſyſtem. The united crowns, in a memorial which was ſigned by the ambaſſadors of both, inſiſted largely on the tyranny which Great Britain exerted upon all powers, eſpecially the maritime, and upon Portugal among the reſt; on the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſult which had been offered to her juriſdiction, by Boſcawen's attack on de la Clue's ſquadron in a Portugueſe harbour; on that affinity, by which the two monarchs of Spain and Portugal are as cloſely connected by the ties of blood, as all powers are by a common intereſt, to oppoſe the ambitious deſigns of the Engliſh.</p>
                        <p>Whatever theſe arguments were deficient in reaſon, was made up by a ſtrong inſinuation of force. The memorial concluded with a declaration, that, as ſoon as his moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful majeſty had taken his reſolution, which they doubted not would prove favourable, their army was ready to enter Portugal, and to garriſon the principal ports of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in order to prevent the dangers to which they might be expoſed from the attempts of the Engliſh.</p>
                        <p>The two miniſters added to this extraordinary memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that they were ordered by their courts to demand a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegorical

anſwer in four days; and that any delay, beyond that time, ſhould be conſidered as a negative.</p>
                        <p>The ſituation of Portugal was at this time certainly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of compaſſion. If, contrary to her known intereſts, contrary to her antient connections, and to the faith of treaties, ſhe ſhould engage in this offenſive alliance, ſhe muſt expect to ſee her territories and her colonies expoſed to the formidable navies of England. This however dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous condeſcenſion was not to ſecure her, by her own act, ſhe would have put herſelf, bound hand and foot, into the power of the Bourbon alliance; and having received foreign garriſons into all her places of ſtrength, would have reduced herſelf to the condition of a province to Spain. On the other hand, if ſhe adhered to her faith, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to maintain her independency, an army of ſixty thouſand men was ready to enter her territories, which contained no place of real ſtrength, and which had not twenty thouſand troops, and thoſe ill armed, and worſe diſciplined, to defend it.</p>
                        <p>In this emergency, the firmneſs of the king of Portugal was eminent, and ſuch as muſt deliver his name to poſterity with the moſt diſtinguiſhed advantage. He reſolved ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to adhere to his antient and natural alliance, and to brave all dangers and difficulties, that he might preſerve his fidelity inviolable; following that generous maxim of king John of France, that if good faith were to be baniſhed from all other parts of the world, it ought to be found in the breaſt of ſovereigns.</p>
                        <p>His anſwer to this inſulting propoſition was humble and moderate, but firm: he obſerved, that the ties, which equally united him to Great Britain and the two crowns, rendered him as proper a mediator to them all, as they made it improper for him to declare himſelf an enemy to any of them; that his alliance with England was antient, and therefore could give no offence at this conjuncture; that it was purely defenſive, and therefore innocent in all its circumſtances; that the late ſufferings of Portugal diſabled her (in caſe ſhe were willing) from taking part in an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive war, into the calamities of which, neither the love his faithful majeſty bore to his ſubjects as a father, nor the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by which he was bound to them as a king, could ſuffer him to plunge them. Finally, he reminded the catholic king of his pacific diſpoſitions, by which, on former occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:1261701201:507"/>
he had yielded ſo much, to preſerve peace between the two kingdoms.</p>
                        <p>This reaſonable and moderate anſwer drew on replies, which more and more diſcloſed the true character and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Bourbon confederacy. They denied that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with England was purely defenſive, or intirely inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and for this unheard-of reaſon, that the defenſive al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance is converted into an offenſive one, <hi>from the ſituation of the Portugueſe dominions, and from the nature of the Engliſh power:</hi> the Engliſh ſquadron, ſaid they, cannot keep the ſea in all ſeaſons, nor cruize on the principal coaſts for cutting off the French and Spaniſh navigation, without the ports and the aſſiſtance of Portugal; that theſe iſland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers could not inſult all maritime Europe, if all the riches of Portugal did not paſs into their hands; that therefore Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal furniſhes them with the means to make war; and their alliance with the court of Great Britain is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, the <hi>ſituation</hi> of a country was never before given as a reaſon, however it might have ſerved as a ſecret motive, for declaring war againſt it. Nor was it before heard, that the common advantages of trade, derived from a neutral nation, could be deemed an act of hoſtility. Theſe were rather inſults than arguments. And the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the united crowns were in the ſame ſtrain; they undertook to judge for Portugal of the pretended yoke which was impoſed upon her by England, and which ſhe could not herſelf diſcover; to reſent injuries for her, for which ſhe had received and accepted ſatisfaction; and, as if this had not been indignity ſufficient, they inſultingly inform the king of Portugal, that <hi>he ought to be glad of the nececeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which they laid upon him to make uſe of his reaſon, in order to take the road of his glory, and the common intereſt.</hi> This neceſſity was the immediate march of their army to take poſſeſſion of his dominions.</p>
                        <p>So extraordinary a treatment neither intimidated the king from the firmneſs of his reſolution, nor provoked him to change from the moderation of his language.

of purſuing againſt Portugal, the war kindled againſt Great Britain; he deſired them to conſider, that they were giving an example, which would produce the deſtruction of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; that there was an end of the public ſafety, if neutral nations were to be attacked, becauſe they have defenſive treaties with the belligerent powers; that a maxim ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive would occaſion deſolation in all Europe, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a war was kindled between any two ſtates; that, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if their troops ſhould enter his dominions, he would, in defence of his neutrality, endeavour to repulſe them with all his forces, and thoſe of his allies; and he concluded with this magnanimous declaration, that <hi>it would affect him leſs, though reduced to the laſt extremity, of which the Great Judge is the ſole arbiter, to let the laſt tile of his palace fall, and to ſee his faithful ſubjects ſpill the laſt drop of their blood, than to ſacrifice, together with the honour of his crown, all that Portugal holds moſt dear; and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, by ſuch extraordinary means, to become an unheard-of example to all pacific powers, who will no longer be able to enjoy the benefit of neutrality, whenever a war ſhall be kindled between other powers, with which the former are connected by defenſive treaties.</hi> When this final reſolution was thus ſpiritedly declared, paſſports were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for the ambaſſadors of the two crowns,

                        <p>We have dwelt ſome time upon this tranſaction: we hope the reader will not think the narrative drawn into a blameable length. The ſubject is intereſting, the proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure uncommon, and the example alarming. This war againſt Portugal was the firſt fruit of the Bourbon compact: they ſhewed very early to the world, what it was to expect from the maturity of this league; when they were ſo ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by the ſuperiority they imagined they had attained, even in forming it, that they thought themſelves diſpenſed from thoſe decorums, and plauſible appearances, which the moſt ambitious princes commonly make uſe of, in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their moſt ambitious deſigns. If they had invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Portugal without any declaration at all, it might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be conſidered as a piece of convenient injuſtice, which they left to the previous neceſſity, and ſubſequent ſucceſs of their affairs, to juſtify as they could; but ſo many memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials

and reaſonings on the ſubject, ſhew that this oppreſſion was deliberate, and that they had not been driven to it by a ſudden emergency, but that it became a regular and avowed part of their political ſyſtem.</p>
                        <p>Having laid open the manner in which the ſouthern part of Europe ſo ſurpriſingly became engaged in this war, it is now our buſineſs to relate in what manner ſome of the northern parts were as ſurpriſingly extricated out of it.</p>

                        <p>WE have ſeen, in the cloſe of the laſt year, that by the taking of Colberg, on one hand, and Schweidnitz, on the other, the king of Pruſſia's dominions were entirely at the mercy of his enemies: his forces were worn away, and even his efforts had gradually declined: a complete victory, tho' this was an event not at all probable, could not ſave him. The Ruſſians, by wintering in Pomerania, and by the poſſeſſion of Colberg, which inſured them ſupplies by a ſafe and expeditious channel, were in a condition to commence their operations much earlier than uſual, as well as to ſuſtain them with more ſpirit and uniformity. No reſource of policy could be tried with the leaſt expectation of ſucceſs. After ſuch a reſiſtance for five years, of which the world never furniſhed another example, the king of Pruſſia had nothing left but ſuch a conduct, as might cloſe the ſcene with glory, ſince there was ſo little appearance of his concluding the war with ſafety.</p>
                        <p>In the midſt of theſe gloomy appearances, his inveterate and inflexible enemy, the empreſs of Ruſſia, died, in the ſixty-third year of her age,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Jan. 2."/> 

 and the twenty-ſecond of her reign.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="450" facs="tcp:1261701201:510"/>This princeſs was ſecond daughter to Peter the Great and a deſcendant not altogether unworthy of that illuſtrious founder of the Ruſſian empire. From being little better than a priſoner, ſhe became in a moment a deſpotic ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. At the acceſſion of this princeſs, the Ruſſian power, ſo newly created, ſeemed to be in danger of a decline, from the many revolutions to which the empire had been ſubject; and the inſtitutions of Peter the Great, by which that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive part of the world was drawn out of barbariſm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan perceivably to decay, until her acceſſion to the throne, when the former was put out of all queſtion by the vigour of her government, and the latter cheriſhed and promoted by the encouragement which ſhe gave to every valuable art and ſcience. The academy at Peterſburgh is at preſent one of the moſt flouriſhing in Europe, and has already enriched the learned world with conſiderable diſcoveries.</p>
                        <p>In fact, ſhe governed the Ruſſian empire with more lenity than any of her predeceſſors; and, perhaps, carried this amiable diſpoſition to an impolitic acceſs. She regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and increaſed her finances; kept alive, and even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, the diſcipline of her armies; and in all her tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions with foreign ſtates, and in the various faces which her politics aſſumed, ſhe always ſupported the dignity and importance of her country at the higheſt point. For her private pleaſures, indeed, ſhe has been much cenſured; but as they were merely pleaſures, and of ſuch a nature that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent had little ſhare in them, they had little influence on her public conduct, which was always manly and firm.</p>
                        <p>The part ſhe took in this war, though it might in ſome meaſure have been dictated by reſentment, was at the fame time the reſult of the ſoundeſt policy. No power, but that of the king of Pruſſia, was capable of checking hers. He was, not only from his ſtrength and character, but from the ſituation of his dominions, the only prince in Europe from whom it could be materially her intereſt to make conqueſts. By the retention of Pruſſia, and by the dominion which in another name, ſhe held over the dutchy of Courland, ſhe poſſeſſed a very great ſhare of the Baltic coaſt, and thereby poſſeſſed the means of becoming a maritime power of the firſt order. With theſe advantages, ſhe might eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete all that had been wanting, towards eſtabliſhing an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable power over Poland. By the ſame means ſhe might entirely over-awe Denmark and Sweden; and alſo,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:1261701201:511"/>
by her vicinity, ſhe would be enabled to interpoſe in the concerns of Germany, with much more authority than ſhe had hitherto poſſeſſed; although her intervention had always been of conſequence.</p>
                        <p>In reality, the houſe of Auſtria ſeemed to make far greater ſacrifices of her intereſt to her reſentment than Ruſſia did, with whom thoſe two principals went hand in hand, and ſupported each other. For nothing is more evident, than that Ruſſia would ſet up for a defender of the liberties of Germany, if ever ſhe got any footing in its neighbourhood; that ſhe would animate the powers there to aſſert a greater degree of independence than they do at preſent; that ſhe would render, by her machinations, the empire in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrian family very precarious; and might even find means of ſetting ſome feeble prince on the imperial throne, in order to embroil the whole Germanic body, and to keep it in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire dependence upon Ruſſia. On the whole, if the projects of Auſtria had ſucceeded in their full extent, ſhe would have very ſoon found in Ruſſia a more powerful reſtraint than ever ſhe had either in France or Sweden, even in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt heights of their power and credit in Germany. She would, indeed, have ruined the king of Pruſſia; but ſhe would have purchaſed his ruin with her own independency.</p>
                        <p>Theſe were the proſpects that lay before all political rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners at the time of the death of the empreſs Elizabeth. Charles Peter Ulric, of the houſe of Holſtein, who had been created grand duke of Ruſſia, and appointed heir ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to that vaſt empire by the late czarina, ſucceeded, under the name of Peter III. None but thoſe who were intimately acquainted with the character and diſpoſition of the new czar, could have any reaſon to imagine that he would abandon the ſyſtem of his predeceſſor, which was certainly founded on the true intereſt of the country he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned. The king of Pruſſia himſelf ſeemed for ſome time to have entertained no great hopes from this change. The czar had, however, ſometimes diſcovered marks of eſteem for the character of this monarch. He had the black eagle, of which order the king of Pruſſia is grand maſter. But the king of Pruſſia could place very little confidence in this: however, with that air of pleaſantry, which never entirely forſook him in all his misfortunes, he ſaid in a letter to Mr. Mitchel, the Britiſh miniſter at the Ruſſian court, "Is not this a very extraordinary knight, to feed 80,000 men at my
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:1261701201:512"/>
expence? He is the only one of my knights that takes that liberty. If every knight of the garter did the ſame, your England (England though it is) would be devoured by them. I beg you would endeavour to make my knight more trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and tell him it is againſt the inſtitutes of the order, for a knight to eat up his grand maſter."</p>
                        <p>The eyes of all Europe were now fixed upon the ſteps which the czar might take. With regard to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his country, nothing could be more popular and auſpicious than his firſt meaſures. The earlieſt uſe he made of his abſolute power, was to ſet the Ruſſian nobility and gentry free, and to put them on the ſame footing with thoſe of their rank in the other more moderate governments of Europe. Almoſt all the exiles were recalled to court, and amongſt the reſt the unfortunate count Biron, who, from a ſovereign prince, had been reduced to the moſt wretched condition, in the moſt wretched country on the globe. He had been many years a peaſant of Siberia, and may very probably once more become a ſovereign prince. It is in thoſe deſpotic governments we ſee the moſt ſtriking exceſſes, and diſmal reverſes of fortune; in which one day a perſon is raiſed to ſomething almoſt above man, and the next is perhaps in a moment degraded to the loweſt ſtation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
                        <p>The new emperor proceeded in his reformation to aboliſh ſome ſevere and tyrannical juriſdictions, and intending the ſame benign diſpoſition to all degrees of his ſubjects, he leſſened the tax upon ſalt, to the very great and univerſal relief of the poor.</p>
                        <p>Theſe beginnings gave the moſt favourable impreſſions of his domeſtic government. But Europe was principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in his foreign politics. It was not long before his diſpoſitions to peace became apparent. What aſtoniſhed the world, was the high rate at which he valued this bleſſing. In a memorial, which he cauſed to be delivered on the 23d of February, to the miniſters of the allied courts, he declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, <hi>in order to the eſtabliſhment of peace, he was ready to ſacrifice all the conqueſts made by the arms of Ruſſia in this war, in hopes that the allied courts will on their parts equally prefer the reſtoration of peace and tranquillity, to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which they might expect from the continuance of the war, but which they cannot obtain but by a continuance of the effuſion of human blood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="453" facs="tcp:1261701201:513"/>The allies praiſed the diſintereſtedneſs, ſpirit, and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this declaration; but recommended to his attention the fidelity to treaties, which conſtitutes a no leſs valuable part of the royal character, and a no leſs conſiderable branch of the duty of a monarch to his ſubjects. They ſhewed a diſpoſition to imitate his deſire for peace, but by no means to follow his example in purchaſing it by a ceſſion of all the advantages, which they had acquired, or hoped to acquire by the war.</p>
                        <p>The Czar having thus far complied with decency, and being of a character little fitted to wait the ſlow procedure of a joint negotiation, gave way to his ardent deſires for peace, and to the ſentiments of that extravagant admiration, which he had conceived for the king of Pruſſia. A ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of hoſtilities was concluded between them on the 16th of March; and it was followed not long after by a treaty of peace and alliance.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="May 5."/> 

 Nothing was ſtipulated by the czar in favour of the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, whom he entirely abandoned. He even agreed to join his troops to thoſe of the king of Pruſſia to act againſt them. In a little time a Ruſſian army was ſeen in conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with one of Pruſſia, to drive out of Sileſia thoſe Auſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who had been a few months before brought into that province by the Ruſſian arms.</p>
                        <p>This was a miraculous revolution. Fortune who had ſo long abandoned the king of Pruſſia to his genuis, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perſecuted him for near five years, and overpowered him with the whole weight of her anger, at length made amends by a ſudden turn, and did for him at one ſtroke the only thing, by which he could poſſibly be ſaved.</p>
                        <p>Sweden who ſince ſhe has recovered her liberty has loſt her political importance, and for a long time acted entirely under the direction of Ruſſian councils, followed on this, as on all other occaſions, the example of the courts of Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and ſigned a treaty of peace with the king of Pruſſia on the 22d of May.</p>
                        <p>In order to account for whatever was not the reſult of mere perſonal character in this extraordinary revolution of politics in Ruſſia, it will be neceſſary to remind the reader, that the czar Peter the third was duke of Holſtein; and that the dukes of Holſtein had pretenſions to the dutchy of Sleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick. Theſe pretenſions were compromiſed by a treaty in 1732. But as the ceſſion made by the houſe of Holſtein in
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:1261701201:514"/>
this treaty was the effect of neceſſity, it had been always apprehended that ſhe would make uſe of the firſt ſafe oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of reclaiming her antient rights. The czar ſeiſed eagerly on the great one, which the poſſeſſion of the whole Ruſſian power afforded him, and he reſolved to enter into an immediate war for this object, to which his predilection for his native country gave in his eyes a far greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance than to all the conqueſts of his predeceſſor. As long as this war with the king of Pruſſia ſubſiſted, it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that his deſigns againſt Denmark could be proſecuted with any hope of ſucceſs. Wholly indifferent therefore to all others, and paſſionately fond of this object, as ſoon as he came to the throne, without any diſpute or negotiation, he offered the king of Pruſſia in his great diſtreſs every thing he could have hoped from a ſeries of victories, and whilſt he joined his arms to thoſe of that monarch in Sileſia, he cauſed an army to march towards Holſtein.</p>
                        <p>Thus the peace with Ruſſia, far from conducing to the general peace of Europe, did very little more than change the face of the war. It brought in new ſubjects of diſpute, and new parties, and by threatning Denmark, left not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle power in the north in a ſtate of aſſured tranquillity.</p>
                        <p>The king of Denmark, though threatned by ſo formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a power engaged in purſuit of a favourite object, was not terrified into any mean conceſſions. He recruited His army, repaired his fortifications, and prepared for his defence; with temper and magnanimty. As money muſt be much wanting for the ſervices of ſo important a war, as his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try could furniſh no great ſupplies, and the borrowings in every part of Europe, together with the ſudden invaſion of his dominions, could enable him to form no ſanguine hopes of public credit, he turned his eyes towards the city of Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, which had enriched itſelf by its induſtry and neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality during the whole war, and by the number of wealthy perſons who had fled there for refuge from the calamities, which all the neighbouring countries had ſuffered.</p>
                        <p>His Daniſh majeſty had always kept alive a claim of ſovereignty over that city, which (whoever founded) he exerciſed whenever he found himſelf able. He thought the preſent one of thoſe conjunctures. Therefore without any previous notice he appears with a ſtrong army before Hamburg,

<pb n="455" facs="tcp:1261701201:515"/>
immediately ſubmit to a loan of 1,000,000 of rix dollars. The magiſtrates of this trading city, little prepared for, or accuſtomed to war, having no ally at hand, and who would be equally endangered by the ſtrength of any ally able to protect them, prudently ſubmitted, and furniſhed the king with ſuch a ſupply as his affairs required.</p>
                        <p>The king of Pruſſia loſt no time to profit of this great and unexpected revolution in his favour. The neutrality of the Ruſſians ſtill left the Auſtrians much ſuperior to him Their alliance brought him to an equality. Two Auſtrian armies in Sileſia and one in Saxony, were prepared to act, and it was not clear which ſide would begin to act on the offenſive; the Auſtrian armies threatened Glogau and Breſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law with a ſiege, and the king of Pruſſia's threatened Sch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weidnitz.</p>
                        <p>The active character of the king of Pruſſia, and the caution of marſhal Daun, ſoon determined the part which the ſeveral armies were to take, and the ſpirit of the ſeveral operations.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="May 12."/> 

 Very early in the camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign prince Henry made a vigorous puſh on the imperial poſts towards the frontiers of Saxony. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts were obliged to evacuate Dippolſwalda with ſome loſs in killed. About four thouſand men were taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; 356 waggons were alſo taken, and ſeveral military trophies,</p>
                        <p>By this ſignal advantage, all the part of Saxony, poſſeſſed by the Pruſſians, was effectually ſecured; and any attempt which might hereafter be thought proper for the recovery of Dreſden, was much facilitated. Although the Auſtrians, ſenſible of the conſequence of this loſs, and largely reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the armies in Sileſia, attempted to recover theſe poſts by ſeveral lively efforts, they were repulſed with no ſmall ſlaughter on both ſides; and prince Henry remained ſo much maſter of Saxony, that it was neceſſary to keep a large army from the war in Sileſia, to prevent if poſſible his making irruptions into the very heart of Bohemia.</p>
                        <p>His Pruſſian majeſty derived advantages from the conduct of his brother, which he did not neglect to improve. It was not until the latter end of June that he was joined by his new Ruſſian allies. As ſoon as this junction was formed, he reſolved to make a tryal of what theſe men could do in his favour, who had acted ſo ſtrenuouſly againſt him. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal Daun's army occupied ſeveral ſtrong, but detached emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:1261701201:516"/>
which enabled him to communicate with and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect Schweidnitz from all attempts of the enemy. The king of Pruſſia undertook to diſlodge,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 21."/> 

 him from thoſe advantageous poſts. In ſome of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts he ſucceeded, in others he was baffled with ſome loſs.</p>
                        <p>This was no regular battle; but the king of Pruſſia, though he did not ſucceed immediately in his attack, yet by his judicious manoeuvres he attained all the advantages he propoſed from his enterpriſe. For marſhal Daun, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive from the motions of his army, that the king of Pruſſia intended to ſeize upon his principal magazine, and even cut off his communication with Bohemia, abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe important poſts which he had hitherto maintained with ſucceſs, fell back to the extremities of Sileſia, and left Schweidnitz entirely uncovered.</p>
                        <p>The king of Pruſſia immediately prepared to inveſt that city whilſt different detachments of Pruſſians, ſome on the ſide of Saxony, others on the ſide of Sileſia, penetrated deep into Bohemia, laid many parts of the country under contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, and ſpread an univerſal alarm. It was about five Years ſince they had been driven from thence by the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious arms of marſhal Daun, who now found himſelf unable to protect that kingdom from their ravages. A conſiderable body of Ruſſian irregulars alſo made an irruption into Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia, and began there to retaliate on the Auſtrians thoſe exceſſes, which they had themſelves ſo often before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on the Pruſſian dominions,</p>
                        <p>Whilſt the king of Pruſſia was thus playing with ſpirit the great game which fortune had put into his hands, he was all at once threatened with a ſudden reverſe, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther revolution in Ruſſia, which bore all the appearance of being as unfavourable to him, as the former had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all hopes beneficial. The variable political climate of Ruſſia, under whoſe influence all his fortune decayed or flouriſhed, was covered with a ſudden cloud by the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, followed cloſe by the death, of his faſt friend, and faithful ally, the czar of Muſcovy.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>FROM the moment of the late czar's acceſſion to the throne of the Ruſſia's, ſomething extraordinary was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. His diſpoſition ſeemed to lead him to make altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in every thing, and having ſet before himſelf two great examples, that of the king of Pruſſia and of his predeceſſor Peter I. it was expected that this vaſt empire was going once more, almoſt within the life of a man, to aſſume a new face; a circumſtance which could not fail of having a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous influence on the affairs of Europe. Peter III. made more new regulations in Ruſſia in a few weeks, than wiſe and cautious princes undertake in a long reign. It was to be feared that his actions were rather guided by a raſh and irregular turn of mind, and the ſpirit of innovation, than by any regular and well digeſted plan, for the improvement of his extenſive dominions.</p>
                        <p>His firſt actions on coming to the throne, it is true, were laudable, and ſeemed well calculated to acquire him the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his people. But if in ſome inſtances he conſulted their intereſts, in many he ſhocked their prejudices; and he loſt thereby that opinion, which is on all occaſions neceſſary, but is particularly ſo for carrying ſuch uncommon deſigns as his into execution.</p>
                        <p>The power of the czar's though abſolute and uncontrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable in its exerciſe, is extremely weak in its foundation. There is not perhaps in Europe a government which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends ſo much on the good will and affection of thoſe that are governed; and which requires a greater degree of vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and a ſteadier hand. The regular ſucceſſion which has been ſo often broken, and the great change of manners, which in leſs than a century has been introduced, have left in Ruſſia a weakneſs amidſt all the appearance of ſtrength, and a great facility to ſudden and dangerous revolutions.</p>
                        <p>Peter III. paid little attention to thoſe difficulties, which
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:1261701201:518"/>
to him were the greater, as he was a foreigner born. They were augmented by the ſuperior and invidious regard he ſeemed to pay to foreign intereſts, and foreign perſons. The preference he ſo manifeſtly gave to the uncertain hope of inconſiderable conqueſt in Holſtein over the ſolid and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able poſſeſſions which the fortune of his predeceſſor had left him, muſt have diſguſted all the politicians of his country. His intimate connection with, and boundleſs admiration of that prince, with whom Ruſſia had been ſo lately, and ſo long, in a ſtate of the moſt violent hoſtility, could not add to the opinion of his prudence. They did not think he ſufficiently conſulted his dignity, in ſoliciting with great anxiety a command in the Pruſſian ſervice. When he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, he dreſſed himſelf in the Pruſſian uniform, made a grand feſtival, and diſplayed all the marks of an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and puerile ſatisfaction. He puſhed his extravagance in this point ſo far, that he made preparations in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature ſtate of his government to quit Ruſſia, and to go into Germany for the ſake of an interview with that great monarch, whoſe genius, principles and fortune he ſo greatly admired.</p>
                        <p>Although this proceeding was, almoſt in every reſpect, extremely impolitic, it did not threaten ſo dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences as the other ſteps, which he took about the ſame time. Nothing requires ſo much judgment, and ſo nice a hand, as to effect a change in the ſettled eſtabliſhments of any country. Above all, there muſt be ſomething favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the conjuncture; or ſomething ſo uncommon and over-ruling in the genius of the conductor of thoſe changes, as will render him ſuperior to all difficulties. This latter was the caſe of Peter I. who had indeed very little favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the conjuncture; but he did every thing by his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, courage, and perſeverance. The ſoldiery and the eccleſiaſtics are the great ſupports of all abſolute rule, and they are certainly the laſt bodies, upon which a prince of this kind would chuſe to exert any invidious act of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But the czar was indiſcreet enough, very early in his reign, highly to provoke both theſe bodies; the ſoldiery, by the manifeſt preference he gave to his Holſtein guards, and to all officers of that nation; and by the change he made in favour of the Pruſſian uniform to the excluſion of that, in which the Ruſſians believed they had ſo often aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the honour of their country, and gained many ſignal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:1261701201:519"/>
over the troops diſtinguiſhed by thoſe regimentals which were now preferred</p>
                        <p>Theſe trifles had very important conſequences. But what he did in matters of religion was ſtill more dangerous. This prince had been educated a Luthern; and though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the Greek church, in order to qualify himſelf for the ſucceſſion, he never ſhewed much reſpect to that mode of religion, to the rites and doctrines of which his ſubjects had been always extremely attached. He ſeized upon the revenues of the clergy, whether monks or ſeculars, whether biſhops or inferiors, and for compenſation allowed them ſome mean penſions, in ſuch a proportion as his fancy ſuggeſted. His capricious order that the clergy ſhould be no longer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by beards, was in itſelf of leſs moment, but it was hardly leſs offenſive. He made alſo ſome regulations concerning the images and pictures in their churches, which gave them reaſon to apprehend his intention of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a total change in the religion of the empire, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Lutheraniſm.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt he was taking theſe meaſures to alienate the minds of his people in general, and eſpecially of thoſe bodies, with whom it was the moſt his intereſt to be well, he had not the good fortune to live in union with his own family. He had long ſlighted his conſort, a princeſs of the houſe of Anhalt Zerbſt, a woman of a maſculine underſtanding, and by whoſe councils he might have profited. He lived in a very public manner with the counteſs of Woronzoff, niece to the chancellor of that name, and ſeemed devoted to her with ſo ſtrong a paſſion, that it was apprehended he had ſome thoughts of throwing his empreſs into a monaſtery, and raiſing this lady to the throne of all the Ruſſias. What ſeemed to confirm this opinion, was his omitting formally to declare his ſon the grand duke Paul Petrowitz the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. This omiſſion in a country where the ſucceſſion is eſtabliſhed and regular, would have been of no conſequence; the punctual obſervance of ſuch a ceremony would rather have betrayed ſome doubt of the title. But the nature of this government, as well as poſſitive conſtitutions, had made it neceſſary in Ruſſia, and the omiſſion was certainly alarming.</p>
                        <p>That unfortunate prince, having in this manner affronted his army, irritated his clergy, offended his nobility, and alienated his own family, without having left himſelf any firm ground of authority, in perſonal eſteem or national
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:1261701201:520"/>
prejudice, proceeded with his uſual precipitation to new changes. In the mean time a moſt dangerous conſpiracy was forming againſt him. The cruel puniſhments inflicted in Ruſſia on ſtate criminals, have only an effect to harden the minds of men already fierce and obdurate, and ſeldom deter them from the moſt deſperate undertakings. Roſamouſki, Hetman or chief of the Coſſacks, a perſon of importance by that command, Panin, governor of the grand duke Paul, marſhal Butterlin, the chamberlain Teplow, the attorney general Glebow, baron Orlow major of the guards, and many others of the great officers and firſt nobility of the Empire, engaged in a conſpiracy to dethrone the czar, who was now univerſally hated; and, what was more fatal to him, univerſally deſpiſed.</p>
                        <p>They aſſured themſelves that their actions could not be diſagreeable to the empreſs; whoſe conduct had always been the very reverſe of that of her conſort, This princeſs find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the affections of her huſband were irrecoverably alienated, endeavoured to ſet up a ſeparate and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent intereſt in her own favour, and for aſſerting the rights of her ſon. She therefore aſſiduouſly cultivated the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Ruſſian nation, and paid a reſpect to their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and religion, in the ſame degree that her huſband ſeemed to cotemn them.</p>
                        <p>So ill was the czar ſerved, that this conſpiracy was grown general, without his receiving the leaſt notice of it, and he remained in perfect ſecurity, whilſt the ſenate and the clergy were aſſembled to paſs the ſentence of his diſpoſition.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 28."/> 

 At this time the empreſs and he were both abſent from the capital at different country ſeats. The empreſs, as ſoon as ſhe found that the deſign was declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, got on horſe-back, and with all poſſible ſpeed arrived at Peterſburg. She immediately harangued the guards, who chearfully and unanimouſly declared in her favour, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed her empreſs of Ruſſia independently of her huſband. She then addreſſed herſelf to the clergy, and the chief of the nobility, who applauded her reſolution; and all orders im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately took the oath of allegiance to her as ſole empreſs. She was no ſooner acknowledged in this manner, than, without loſing a moment's time, ſhe marched from Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg towards the emperor at the head of a body of troops.</p>
                        <p>This prince was indulging himſelf in indolent amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and lulled in the moſt profound ſecurity at a houſe
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:1261701201:521"/>
of pleaſure, called Oraniebaum on the ſea ſhore, when a ſoldier brought him an account that his kingdom was taken away from him.</p>
                        <p>Aſtoniſhed, and wholly unprepared for this event, he was ſome time ſenſeleſs, and entirely at a loſs what part to take. When he was rouzed from this trance by the approaching danger, his firſt ſuggeſtion was to defend the place with his Holſtein guards; but tho' ſatisfied of their attachment, he doubted their ſtrength, and he knew it was in vain to hope for any effort in his favour from the Ruſſians.</p>
                        <p>Nothing then remained but flight, by which he might eſcape to Holſtein, and wait ſome favourable turn of fortune. This late lord of powerful fleets and armies embarked in a ſmall veſſel, and with a few attendants, rowed towards Cronſtadt; but he had not proceeded very far, when he was informed that this fortreſs was in the hands of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and that every avenue for eſcape was ſhut againſt him. Dejected and deſponding he returned to Oraniebaum. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome ſhort and tumultuous deliberation, he reſolved to abandon all thoughts of defence, and to throw himſelf on the compaſſion of the empreſs.</p>
                        <p>On her march ſhe met his meſſengers, who brought let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters containing a renunciation of the empire, and ſtipulating no other terms than leave to return to Holſtein, and the ſatisfaction of taking with him, as the companion of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, the counteſs of Woronzoff and one ſingle friend.</p>
                        <p>Reaſons of ſtate could not permit the empreſs to conſent to the firſt of thoſe terms, and the laſt could not be very flattering to her. His terms were rejected; and he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to ſign an unconditional reſignation of his crown, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a form that was prepared for him. Not ſatisfied with depriving him of his crown, it was thought fit to make him the murderer of his own reputation; and this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate prince, moved with the vain hope of life, ſigned a paper declaring his conviction of his inability to govern the empire, either as a ſovereign, or in any other capacity, and his ſenſe of the diſtreſs, in which his continuing at the head of affairs would inevitably involve it. After he had ſigned this abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, he gave up his ſword, and was conducted to priſon, where in a ſhort time,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 6."/> 

 but according to what had been univerſally expected, he died. The diſorder, which killed him, was called an hemorrhoidal cholic.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="462" facs="tcp:1261701201:522"/>Thus was a revolution of ſuch immenſe importance effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſingle day, and without ſhedding a ſingle drop of blood. The unfortunate emperor enjoyed the power, of which he had made ſo imprudent and unpolitic an uſe, no longer than ſix months. His wife, without any hereditary title, is ſovereign miſtreſs of the Ruſſian empire; and the moſt abſolute power on earth, is now held by an elective monarch.</p>
                        <p>Immediately on this revolution a number of manifeſtoes appeared, in which the conduct of the late czar was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely condemned, the weakneſs of his perſonal character expoſed, and deſigns of the blackeſt kind, even that of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his conſort, attributed to him. Thoſe manifeſtoes at the ſame time were filled with the ſtrongeſt declarations of affection from the empreſs to the ſubjects of Ruſſia, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their intereſts, and of attachment to their religion; and they are all filled with ſuch unaffected and fervent ſtrains of piety, as muſt needs prove extremely edifying to thoſe who are acquainted with the ſentiments of pure religion, by which great princes are generally animated on occaſions of this nature.</p>
                        <p>Nothing could be more able than the conduct of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, ſince her acceſſion to the throne. In almoſt all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects it was the very reverſe of that of her huſband. She diſmiſſed all foreigners from her confidence and ſervice; ſhe ſent away the Holſtein guards, and choſe Ruſſian, whoſe antient uniform was revived with luſtre, the empreſs her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf frequently condeſcending to appear in it. The clergy were reſtored to their poſſeſſions, and their beards. She conferred all the great poſts of the empire on native Ruſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and entirely threw herſelf on the affections of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to whom ſhe owed her elevation.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THIS great change in the government of Ruſſia, it was univerſally feared, would be followed by a total change of ſyſtem with regard to foreign affairs. The peace and alliance with the king of Pruſſia were very unpopular meaſures in Muſcovy. It was not probable that the cloſe and intimate connection which had ſubſiſted between the king of Pruſſia and the late czar, could greatly recommend him to the ſucceſſor. And as it was imagined that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution muſt have been in a great degree owing to the machinations of thoſe courts, whom the czar had irritated by withdrawing from their alliance, there was the greater reaſon to apprehend that the power, which was now ſet up, would be exerted in their favour.</p>
                        <p>There were alſo great advantages on the ſide of Ruſſia, if the empreſs ſhould not hold the peace concluded by her late huſband to be binding on her, as none of the conqueſts were at this time evacuated. Every thing ſeemed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire towards plunging the king of Pruſſia into the abyſs of his former diſtreſſes, after he had emerged from them, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſuch a time, and in ſuch a manner, as to make them more bitter and inſupportable.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, however, for this wonderful man, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, who had come to the Ruſſian throne in the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner that we have ſeen, could not look upon her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as ſufficiently ſecure to undertake again a war of ſo much importance as that which had been juſt concluded. It was neceſſary, for ſome time at leaſt, that ſhe ſhould confine her attention ſolely to her own ſafety. Therefore it was
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:1261701201:524"/>
expedient to collect, within itſelf, all the force of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, in order to oppoſe it to the deſigns of the many mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, with which that empire always abounds, and who, though not attached to the intereſt of the late czar, and little inclined to revenge his fate, would find now both inducement and opportunity for raiſing troubles and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting new changes. Very plauſible pretences for ſuch attempts exiſted from the time of Peter the Great; who, whilſt he improved and ſtrengthened his kingdom, left in it, at the ſame time, the ſeeds of civil wars and revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</p>
                        <p>Theſe conſiderations, whatever her deſires might be, induced the czarina to continue ſo much of the ſyſtem of her predeceſſor, as coincided with her ſituation. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared to the king of Pruſſia's miniſters, "that ſhe was reſolved to obſerve inviolably, in all points, the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual peace concluded under the preceding reign, that never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſhe had thought proper to bring back to Ruſſia, by the neareſt roads, all her troops in Sileſia, Pruſſia, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merania."</p>
                        <p>It was not the critical ſituation alone of the czarina which produced this moderation; the prudent behaviour of his Pruſſian majeſty, during the time of his connection with the late czar, had a conſiderable ſhare in reconciling the mind of this empreſs to him, and of perpetuating ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like the ſame friendſhip, with intereſts ſo very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. The Ruſſian ſenate, flaming with reſentment againſt this monarch, and againſt their late ſovereign; and the empreſs, full of ſuſpicion that the conduct of the latter might have been influenced by the councils of the former, ſearched eagerly amongſt the papers of the late emperor for elucidation or proofs of this point. They found indeed many letters from the king of Pruſſia; but in a ſtrain abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely different from what they apprehended. The king of Pruſſia had, as far as prudence would admit, kept a reſerve and diſtance in regard to the raſh advances of this unhappy ally. Too experienced to be carried away by his inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate impetuoſity, he gave him much ſalutary, though fruitleſs, advice; he counſelled him to undertake nothing againſt the empreſs his conſort; to deſiſt from the war with Denmark; to attempt no changes in the religion and fundamental laws of the country; and not to think of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Germany.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="465" facs="tcp:1261701201:525"/>On hearing theſe letters read, the empreſs is ſaid to have burſt into tears of gratitude, and made in conſequence the ſtrongeſt declarations in favour of this prince. They were not without effect. Orders had been given with relation to Pruſſia, which threatened a renewal of hoſtilities. They were ſoon ſuſpended. The army of the Ruſſians was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſeparated from that of Pruſſia; but all the important places, which the Ruſſians had, with ſo much bloodſhed, and through ſo many difficulties acquired, and which gave them the command of every thing elſe that remained to the king, were faithfully reſtored.</p>
                        <p>This change from a ſtrict alliance to a cold neutrality, though it made no ſmall difference in the Pruſſian affairs, yet, all things conſidered, muſt be regarded as an eſcape, and as a deliverance almoſt as wonderful as his former. However, this circumſtance could not fail of inſpiring ſome degree of confidence into his enemies, which the king of Pruſſia endeavoured above all things to prevent.</p>
                        <p>On the 21ſt of July<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the orders arrived at the allied camp from Peterſburg, for the Ruſſians to ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from his army, and return without delay to their own country. The king, without being confounded by this ſudden order, and inſtead of ſlackening his efforts on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this deſertion, reſolved to fall with vigour, and without delay; upon marſhal Daun, and to attack him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the news of this change could reach him. Since he could no longer profit by the arms of the Ruſſians, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to profit at leaſt by their appearance in his camp. The very next day therefore he attacked the Auſtrian army, whoſe right wing occupied the heights of Buckerſdorff; drove them from that eminence, and from ſome villages where they were advantageouſly poſted. The ſucceſs was not owing only to the ſpirit of the actual attack, but to an apprehenſion of the Auſtrians, that the whole united army of the Pruſſians and Muſcovites was on the point of engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. The king of Pruſſia made an uſe of thoſe allies, in the moment they deſerted him.</p>
                        <p>This lively attack was made with a loſs only of three hundred men on the ſide of the Pruſſians; the number of the Auſtrians killed is not known. The priſoners amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to one thouſand; and fourteen pieces of cannon were taken. It was indeed no more than an affair of poſts; but its conſequences were important; for the communication
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:1261701201:526"/>
of the Imperialiſts with Schweidnitz was now entirely and finally cut off; they could not attempt any thing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for the relief of that place. Prince Henry held them in continual alarm for Bohemia, and a great part of their attention, and no ſmall part of their forces were kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually engaged upon that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ide.</p>
                        <p>The king of Pruſſia having thus puſhed back marſhal Daun, inveſted Schweidnitz, and laid ſiege to that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant fortreſs before his face. This was the fourth time which that place had been beſieged ſince the beginning of this war; and this circumſtance alone might ſuffice to ſhew the many and extraordinary changes of fortune which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed theſe campaigns. We apprehend no inſtance has happened before of any place like this of real ſtrength being ſo often ſucceſſively taken and retaken in the courſe of a ſingle war.</p>
                        <p>As Schweidnitz is the key of Sileſia, and, though not quite a regular place, is notwithſtanding well ſituated and well fortified; as the garriſon amounted to nine thouſand men, commanded by a good officer, and aſſiſted by a very experienced engineer, and as two great armies of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my obſerved all his motions, it was neceſſary to make the diſpoſitions for the ſiege with uncommon care. His infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry were encamped on the heights behind Schweidnitz. His cavalry formed a chain in the plains of Keintzerdorf, to be nearer the camp of the prince of Wirtemberg, which was ſituated ſo as to prevent any enterprize from the county of Glatz. The prince of Bevern commanded a ſtrong corps, which poſted itſelf advantageouſly near Coſel. One under general Werner did the ſame at Noiſſa.</p>
                        <p>By theſe diſpoſitions the Pruſſian convoys were protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the principal places in Sileſia guarded, the ſiege of Sch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weidnitz covered, and an eaſy communication preſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all the detached corps employed in theſe ſeveral ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
                        <p>The effects of this wiſe diſpoſition were ſoon felt. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal Daun, deſpairing to ſucceed againſt the army, which, under the king in perſon, covered the ſiege of Schweidnitz, endeavoured to break this chain, and by that means diſtreſs the Pruſſians who were carrying on the ſiege. Laudohn was therefore detached, with a very ſuperior force, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the prince of Bevern, and to drive him from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous poſt he occupied. This attack was made with
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:1261701201:527"/>
all the celerity and reſolution, which diſtinguiſh the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this brave officer. But the prince, mindful of the diſgrace he had formerly ſuffered in this province, oppoſed him with ſuch conſtancy and perſeverance, that the king of Pruſſia had time to come to his relief. The Auſtrians were then put between two fires, routed, and purſued with a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſlaughter.</p>
                        <p>This attempt being defeated, the king of Pruſſia met with no diſturbance in his preparations for the ſiege, and the trenches were opened on the night of the 8th of July.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt the king of Pruſſia was making this advantageous uſe of his fortune, the armies of the French and the allies in Weſtphalia were not inactive. Among the commanders of the former a great diſunion had long prevailed. The marſhals de Broglio and de Soubiſe had mutually accuſed each other; the camp and the court were for ſome time entirely diſtracted with the cabals of the partizans of theſe officers. The reſult was not favourable to marſhal Broglio. In him the French court was obliged to recal, and in ſome meaſure to diſgrace, one of the very beſt of their officers. A ſuſpicion, and that not weakly founded, prevailed againſt this general, that unable to bear a competitor in fame, or an aſſociate in command, he had often, in order to diſgrace thoſe with whom he was to act, neglected to improve his favourable opportunities; and that in ſome inſtances, by his conduct, he had purpoſely occaſioned ſome failures, and even defeats. This was a fault which no great qualities in an officer could compenſate, He was therefore removed from his command, and the conduct of the army left to the prince de Soubiſe, who was infinitely beloved by the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers for his generous and benevolent diſpoſition; and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal d'Etrees, who has been ſo often mentioned in the courſe of this hiſtory, was aſſociated with him.</p>
                        <p>The plan of the campaign, on the part of the French, did not differ much from that which had been formerly purſued. They had, as before, two armies; this under the prince de Soubiſe and marſhal d'Etrees on the Weſer, and another under the prince de Conde on the Lower Rhine.</p>
                        <p>The diſpoſition of the allies was alſo but little varied. The hereditary prince was poſted in the biſhoprick of Munſter, to watch the latter of theſe armies; and prince Ferdinand in perſon, with the body of the army, lay behind the Dymel to make head againſt the former. So little had the French
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:1261701201:528"/>
profited by their ſuperior numbers, and ſuperior reſources in this continental war, and ſo little deciſive uſe had they made even of ſome advantages in the field, that this cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign commenced very nearly in the ſame place, and they contended for pretty much the ſame objects, which they had ſtruggled for in the two preceding years.</p>
                        <p>So ſuperior was the genius of prince Ferdinand, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many diſadvantages he was the firſt to commence offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive operations. The ſtroke he ſtruck on this occaſion would ſuffice alone to rank him with the firſt commanders of his age. His abilities throughout the war have never ſhone out with more luſtre than in this campaign, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it.</p>
                        <p>The French army was moſt advantageouſly poſted, both for command of the country, and for ſtrength, near a place called Graebenſtein, in the frontiers of Heſſe; their center occupied an advantageous eminence; their left wing was almoſt inacceſſible by ſeveral deep ravines, and their right was covered by the village of Graebenſtein, by ſeveral ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets, and a ſtrong detached body under one of their beſt officers, monſieur de Caſtries.</p>
                        <p>In this ſituation they imagined they had nothing to fear from the attempts of prince Ferdinand, whoſe army, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the inferiority of its numbers, was ſeparated in ſuch a manner, and in ſuch diſtant places, that they judged it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it could unite in any attack upon their camp. But whilſt they enjoyed themſelves in full ſecurity, the ſtorm was preparing to fall upon them from all quarters.</p>
                        <p>A conſiderable corps of the allied army, under general Luckner, was poſted to the eaſtward of the Weſer, near E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>mbecke, on the Leine. He lay there to obſerve prince Xavier of Saxony, who was encamped between the Werra and Gottingen. But if he watched the prince, the prince alſo watched him. When, therefore, he had orders to quit this poſt, that he might co-operate in the grand deſign, he left a ſmall party of his corps in his ſtation, by which he deceived the prince of Saxony; and marching in the night with the utmoſt ſpeed, he croſſed the Weſer, turned the right of the French army, and, without being diſcovered, placed himſelf upon their rear. General Sporcken at the ſame time placed himſelf ſo as to attack the ſame wing in flank. Prince Ferdinand croſſed the Dymel, in order to
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:1261701201:529"/>
fall upon their center. The attack on the enemy's left was commanded by lord Granby.</p>
                        <p>Theſe preparations were made with ſo much judgment, celerity, and good order, that the French had not perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the approach of the allies, when they found themſelves attacked with infinite impetuoſity in front, flank, and rear.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 24."/> 

 The battle was ſcarcely begun, when they thought of nothing but flight. The corps under mounſieur de Caſtries had time to retreat in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable order, and without any great loſs. But it did not fare ſo well with their center, and their left, which were oppoſed by the calm reſolution of prince Ferdinand, and the generous courage of Granby.</p>
                        <p>As the French placed all their hopes rather in retreat than combat, an entire rout muſt have enſued, if monſieur Stainville, who commanded on the left, had not thrown himſelf with the flower of the French infantry into a wood, which enabled him, at the expence of the beſt part of it, to cover the retreat of the army. Here this brave and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed officer made a reſolute ſtand, and for a long time ſuſtained the whole weight of the allies. His corps was a devoted ſacrifice. All but two battalions were cut to pieces or made priſoners. The other bodies, covered by this reſolute manoeuvre, made a ſhift to cover themſeles under the cannon of Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, or precipitately eſcaped to the other ſide of the Fulda.</p>
                        <p>Thus did the French army, by the virtue of monſieur de Stainville, eſcape a total defeat; but the conſequences of the action were not recovered during the whole cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign. They loſt much credit both in point of reſolution and generalſhip. Their infantry, in this engagement, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of one hundred battalions, when that of the allies was compoſed but of ſixty. The common men made priſoners by the allies on this occaſion were two thouſand ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty, and no leſs than one hundred and ſixty-two officers were taken. The Engliſh loſt but a few men killed, and no officer of rank but lieutenant-colonel Townſhend

who fell with great glory to himſelf, and to the regret of the whole army.</p>
                        <p>Every thing in the conduct of prince Ferdinand appears the effect of a well digeſted plan; and one great action compleated always helps to diſcloſe a ſeries of bold, maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and connected deſigns.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as the enemy was diſloged from their ſtrong poſt, uſe was made of this advantage (whilſt the French, under the hurry and confuſion of their late misfortunes, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to provide againſt unexpected accidents) to puſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a body of the Engliſh under lord Granby and lord Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick Cavendiſh. The French could ſcarcely imagine, that, whilſt they were in poſſeſſion of ſo ſtrong a place as Caſſel, and commanded an army ſo ſuperior in numbers to the allies, that, whilſt prince Ferdinand braved them in front, they ſhould find one of his detachments upwards of thirty miles behind them. In this emergency, monſieur de Rochambeau perceiving their motions, haſtily collected ſome brigades of infantry and cavalry at Hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 6."/> 

 to prevent, if poſſible, the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the grand army with Franckfort from being cut off. But they were charged with ſo much vigour by the two engliſh commanders, that, though they defended themſelves with ſpirit for ſome time, they were in the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue diſperſed with conſiderable loſs. They were obliged to evacuate that tract of country. Fritzlar, Feltzberg, and Lohr; and almoſt all the important poſts in the ſouth part of Heſſe were occupied by the allies. The communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Franckfort, from whence the French drew their whole ſubſiſtence, was abſolutely intercepted.</p>
                        <p>To the north of Heſſe alſo the allies were not leſs active, nor leſs ſucceſsful: they obliged prince Xavier, with his Saxon detachments, to abandon his advanced poſt on the Leine, and unite himſelf to the grand army. They got between him and Gottingen, by which the French garriſon there was left without ſupport. This garriſon, ſeeing its communication interrupted, blew up a part of the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and attempted a retreat; but finding no avenue open, they were obliged to return in confuſion. Deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their ability to hold this important place, they thought themſelves happy, when at length, with much management and difficulty,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 16."/> 

 they were able to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate it without oppoſition.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="471" facs="tcp:1261701201:531"/>Prince Xavier, after having, as we ſaid before, quitted his advanced ſituation at Morungen in the territories of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover, united himſelf to the right of the principal army, which was poſted to the eaſtward of the Fulda, not far from the place where that river forms an angle in its junction with the Werra. In this angle ſtands the town of Munden, a fortified place, in which the French had a garriſon. Full of confidence from this ſituation, they were under no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion: but the generals Zaſtrow, Gilſac, and Waldhauſen, paſſed the Fulda in their ſight,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 23."/> 

 and under a heavy fire of their cannon. The corps of the two former officers poſſeſſed themſelves of a wood on the enemy's right flank. General Waldhauſen, in the mean time, had ſeized the village of Bonnevert, which enabled him to keep the garriſon of Munden in check, and gave him alſo an oportunity, whenever the occaſion required it, of falling on the enemy's rear.</p>
                        <p>The bold paſſage of the Fulda, and the judgment of the ſubſequent diſpoſitions, inſured the victory. Prince Xavier, for a good while, defended himſelf with an obſtinate reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but finding his flank gained, he began to give way. In this Inſtant Waldhauſen, who had hitherto only watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the iſſue of the engagement, threw in his horſe upon the rear and compleated the defeat.</p>
                        <p>General Stainville, who occupied a ſtrong entrenched camp in the neighbourhood, ſeeing the party of the prince of Saxony in danger of being totally cut to pieces, quitted his intrenchments with his whole army of ten thouſand men, and haſtened to their relief. Prince Frederick of Brunſwick, attentive to this movement, with great quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeized this critical opportunity, entered their camp the moment they had left it, and entirely deſtroyed all their works. In this action 1100 of the enemy were made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
                        <p>The French finding their communication deſtroyed, their army ſurrounded and harraſſed on every ſide, and without intermiſſion, were neither able to advance with a proſpect of ſucceſs, or to retreat with any hope of ſafety. In this diſtreſs they had nothing left but to call their army from the Lower Rhine to their aſſiſtance. No time was to be loſt. Expreſs after expreſs was ſent to haſten them. In conſequence of theſe diſpatches, the prince of Conde ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by forced marches; the hereditary prince ſtuck
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:1261701201:532"/>
cloſe to him, and kept himſelf in readineſs to fall upon his corps, when a favourable opportunity ſhould offer.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time prince Ferdinand preſſed upon Soubiſe's army. Advantageouſly as they were ſituated, he offered them battle for a whole day. Rather than riſque an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement they decamped in the night, and quitted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an action, thoſe advantageous grounds called the heights of Mulſingen, where they could not be attempted without the greateſt difficulty and hazard; and the quitting of which gave prince Ferdinand the moſt important advantages over them.</p>
                        <p>Never were military operations puſhed with more viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, whilſt the negotiation for peace was in great forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The two great contending courts had opened confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, whilſt their armies were cutting one another in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but prince Ferdinand on that account, rather ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than ſlackened his efforts. He knew that the negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for peace is always much forwarded by the opperations of the campaign, and that a ſucceſsful action often haſtens the deciſion of a conteſted article. Perhaps too he was willing to ſhew in England, that the neceſſity of making peace ought not to be attributed to the circumſtances of that part of the war which had been committed to his care. People imagined they could diſcern ſomething like coldneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this great commander in the new Britiſh miniſtry; and that he, on his ſide, ſeemed rather to favour that party in England which was for prolonging the war.</p>

                        <p>THE events of the war in Germany, though its object was not more intereſting than that in Portugal, ſeem to rank far before the actions of the latter in dignity and importance. They naturally occupy the firſt place, and juſtify a more minute detail in an hiſtory of military opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is in Germany that the great efforts of all the great powers in Europe were made from the beginning.
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:1261701201:533"/>
Here the moſt conſiderable armies were maintained; here the great battles were fought; and on this theatre the great commanders gave a full ſcope to their genius. Germany ſeems, as it were, the natural ſoil of hoſtility; but Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, which had long languiſhed in a tranquil obſcurity, could ſcarce furniſh out a faint image of war.</p>
                        <p>Of the ſtate of the military in that country we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a preceeding chapter. The marine was not on a much more reſpectable footing. About ſix or ſeven ſhips of the line, and a very few frigates, compoſed all the naval force of Portugal that was fit for ſervice; of that Portugal which had formerly been one of the firſt maritime powers in Europe. The fortifications in that kingdom had been alſo long neglected, and ſcarce any of them were in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſuſtain a regular ſiege.</p>
                        <p>Portugal, however, poſſeſſed ſome advantages; but they were only ſuch as ſhe derived from her weakneſs. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme barrenneſs and poverty of the country, made it very difficult for an army, either of friends or enemies, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in it. The badneſs of the roads, and the frequency and ſteepneſs of the mountains, which occupy the greateſt part of that kingdom, made it no leſs difficult to advance with rapid marches, and to improve the advantages of the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign with proper expedition. The nature of the country alſo rendered it not unfit for that ſpecies of defence, which the beſt force it had was beſt qualified to make; that is, in the way of an irregular war, by its armed peaſantry; for the defiles in many places are of ſuch a nature, as to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being maintained by a ſmall and undiſciplined body, againſt very numerous and very regular forces. And the Portugueſe, from the higheſt to the loweſt, were animated with ſuch a ſincere and inveterate hatred to the Spaniſh name, and were filled with ſo much terror at the proſpect of falling a ſecond time under the government of that nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that great hopes were entertained of their exerting themſelves to the utmoſt on this occaſion, and of their rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that natural courage in which the Portugueſe are not deficient.</p>
                        <p>Theſe advantages, however, did by no means balance the dangers to which that kingdom was expoſed, from the joint hoſtility of France and Spain. All the hope of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal was centered in England, for whoſe ſake, and in whoſe quarrel ſhe had been drawn into this unequal conteſt. The
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:1261701201:534"/>
greater the weakneſs of Portugal was, the more conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous were the magnanimity and reſources of Great Britain, who made in the cloſe of ſo expenſive and ruinous a war, ſuch aſtoniſhing efforts and who was in a condition by her ſtrength to prop up, at leaſt for a time, ſo very feeble a ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. She ſent to Portugal, officers, troops, artillery, arms, military ſtores, proviſions, and money, every thing which could enable the Portugueſe to exert their natural ſtrength, and every thing which could ſupply that ſtrength where it was deficient.</p>
                        <p>When the Bourbon courts made war againſt Portugal, the declared object was to prevent Great Britain from the military and commercial uſe of the ports of that kingdom. As it was impoſſible to attain this object by naval operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they attempted it by military ones, and aimed their principal endeavours at the two great ports, to which the Engliſh principally reſort, Oporto and Liſbon. The poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of theſe two objects would probably have finiſhed the war in their favour; the poſſeſſion of either of them would have given them the moſt deciſive advantages in it.</p>
                        <p>With this view three inroads were to be made, one to the north, another was propoſed more to the ſouth, whilſt the third was made in the middle provinces, in order to ſuſtain theſe two bodies, and preſerve the communication between them. The reader muſt conſider this as what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from their deſigns, and from the ſteps they took to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them to have been their general plan; not that it was ever perfectly executed in all its parts, or at the ſame time.</p>
                        <p>The firſt body which commenced hoſtilities was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the marquis de Sarria. This army entered into the north eaſt angle of Portugal, and marched towards Miranda. This town, though in no good ſtate of defence, might have delayed them in their progreſs; but a powder magazine having blown up by accident, the fortifications were ruined, and the Spaniards, before they had raiſed their firſt battery,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="May 9."/> 

 marched into the town by the breaches in the wall.</p>
                        <p>Animated by this eaſy and fortunate ſucceſs, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Braganza, a conſiderable city, from whence the royal family of Portugal derived its ducal titles. This town made no greater defence than Miranda. From thence a detachment marched to Moncorvo,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="May 15."/> 

 which was ſurrendered in the like manner; and
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:1261701201:535"/>
every thing was cleared before them to the banks of the Douro. A party under count O'Reilly made a forced march of fourteen leagues, in two days,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="May 24."/> 

 to the city of Chaves, which was immediately evacuated. By theſe ſucceſſes they became maſters of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole of the extenſive province of Tralos Montes, and their progreſs ſpread a general alarm. Oporto was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt given up as loſt; and the admiralty of England prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red tranſports to carry off the effects of the Britiſh factory. However, the body which had traverſed this province with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance, attempting to croſs the Douro, had its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs checked on that ſide. The peaſants, animated and guided by ſome Engliſh officers, and ſeizing a difficult paſs, repulſed and drove them back to Torre de Moncorvo. They are ſaid to have been guilty of ſome cruelties to the Spaniſh priſoners who fell into their hands. Theſe cruelties were afterwards ſeverely retaliated upon them. Theſe people, on both ſides naturally ferocious had not been ſufficiently inured to war, to moderate its fury, and reduce it under laws; they hated mutually, and they gave a full ſcope to their hatred: they did not ſee each other as ſoldiers, but as enemies.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond body of the Spaniards, which we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as the connective link between the two others, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the province of Beira, at the villages called Val de Mula and Valde Coelha. They were joined by ſtrong detachments, amounting to almoſt the whole army in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los Montes, and immediately laid ſiege to Almeida, which, though in no good order, was the ſtrongeſt and beſt provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded place upon the frontiers of Portugal. Beſides, it was of the greateſt importance from its middle ſituation, as the poſſeſſion of it would greatly facilitate the operations upon every ſide, and would eſpecially tend to forward an attempt upon Liſbon, which was the capital object, towards which, at this time, all the endeavours of the Spaniards ſeem to have been directed.</p>
                        <p>Almedia was defended with ſufficient reſolution; but its fate was foreſeen as ſoon as it was attempted, there being no means of affording relief to any of the places beſieged. It ſurrendered however,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 25."/> 

 upon terms honourable to the garriſon.</p>
                        <p>The Spaniards, having made themſelves maſters of this place overſpread the whole ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="476" facs="tcp:1261701201:536"/>
principal diſtrict of the province of Beira, making their way to the ſouthward, until they approached the banks of the Tagus. During the whole of their progreſs, and indeed during the whole campaign, the allied troops of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Portugal had nothing that could be called a body of an army in the field, and they could not think of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the enemy in a pitched battle. All that could be done was by the defence of paſſes, by ſkirmiſh, and by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>
                        <p>By this time the count of la Lippe Buckeburg had arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Portugal. Lord Tyrawly, who had been ſent, at the deſire of the court of Liſbon, thither before the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the war, being diſguſted by the behaviour of ſome perſons at court, and much diſappointed in his expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of the exertion they had promiſed to make of their own force, and even of the uſe they had made of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours from England, had been recalled very early in the campaign, and probably not contrary to his own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                        <p>It is impoſſible to expreſs the joy which filled the whole nation at the arrival of ſo celebrated an officer as the count la Lippe to their aſſiſtance. More unanimity was now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, as the count had nothing to complain of, and came an entire ſtranger to all the ſubjects of debate, which had hitherto exiſted between the Britiſh general and the court of Liſbon.</p>
                        <p>That army, which we have mentioned as the third corps deſtined for the invaſion of Portugal, aſſembled on the frontiers of Eſtremadura, with an intention of penetrating into the province of Alentejo. Had this third body been joined to the others already in Portugal, it would probably have formed ſuch an army as might, in ſpight of any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, have forced its way to Liſbon: had it acted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately, it might have greatly diſtracted the defence, ſo as to enable ſome other body to penetrate to that city. It was neceſſary to prevent, if poſſible, their entrance into Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal; ſince their mere entrance would have been almoſt equal, in its conſequences, to a victory on their ſide.</p>
                        <p>The count la Lippe, therefore formed a deſign of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking an advanced body of the Spaniards which lay on their frontiers, in a town called Valentia de Alcantara, as he heard that they had here amaſſed conſiderable maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines.
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:1261701201:537"/>
The conduct of this important enterprize was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to brigadier general Burgoyne.</p>
                        <p>This gallant and able officer, though at a diſtance of five days march, and in ſpight of all the diſappointments and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to which ſervices of this kind are ſo liable, when they cannot be executed immediately; yet effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a complete ſurprize on the town of Valentia de Alcantara; took the general,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 27."/> 

 who was to have commanded in the intended invaſion, one colonel, two captains, and ſeventeen ſubaltern officers. One of the beſt regiments in the Spaniſh ſervice was entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
                        <p>Although they were diſappointed in their expectations of finding magagines in this place, the effect of this well-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted enterprize was not loſt. The taking of this general was probably the cauſe which prevented the Spaniards from entering into the province of Alentejo. This ſeemed to have been for ſome time the deſtination not only of that particular body, but alſo the great object of the Spaniſh army, which had hitherto acted in Beira. The former of theſe provinces is a plain, open, fertile country, where their cavalry, in which conſiſted the chief of their army, and in which lay their moſt marked ſuperiority, might have acted, and acted deciſively; whereas the latter was a rough moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous region, in which the horſe were ſubſiſted with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and could be of little ſervice. To prevent, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the entry of the Bourbon army from any quarter, into Alentejo, ſeemed to be the great and ſingle object of the campaign on our ſide. General Burgoyne, by his expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Spaniſh territories, had already prevented it on one part; and the vigilance and activity of the ſame officer had no ſmall ſhare in preventing it alſo on the other.</p>
                        <p>That part of the Bourbon army, which acted in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of Caſtel Branco, had made themſelves maſters of ſeveral important paſſes, which they obliged ſome bodies of the Portugueſe to abandon. They attacked the rear of the combined army, which was paſſing the river Alveito, with the appearance of a retreat; but, in reality, with a view to draw them inſenſibly into the mountainous tracts: here they were repulſed with loſs; but ſtill they continued maſters of the country; and nothing remained but the paſſage of the Tagus, to enable them to take up their quarters in Alentejo.</p>

                           <pb n="478" facs="tcp:1261701201:538"/>Burgoyne, who was poſted with an intention to obſtruct them in their paſſage, lay in the neighbourhood, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in view of a detached camp, compoſed of a conſiderable body of the enemy's cavalry, which lay near a village cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Villa Velha. As he obſerved that the enemy kept no very ſoldiery guard in this poſt, and were uncovered both on their rear and their flanks, he conceived a deſign of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them by ſurprize. He confided the execution of this deſign to colonel Lee, who turned their camp, fell upon their rear in the night,

 made a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſlaughter, diſperſed the whole party, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their magazines, and returned with ſcarce any loſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Burgoyne, in the mean time, ſupported him by a feint at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack in another quarter, which prevented the enemy's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relieved from the adjacent poſts.</p>
                        <p>This advantage, being obtained in a critical moment, was attended with important conſequences. The ſeaſon was now far advanced; immenſe rains fell at this time; the roads were deſtroyed; the country became impracticable; and the Spaniards, having ſeiſed no advanced poſts in which they could maintain themſelves during the winter, and being eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially unprovided with magazines for the ſupport of their horſe, every where fell back to the frontiers of Spain, where their ſupplies were at hand, and where they were not liable to be harraſſed by the efforts of the combined army.</p>
                        <p>In this manner Portugal was ſaved, at leaſt for that cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, by the wiſe conduct of count la Lippe, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed valour of the Engliſh commanders and ſoldiery: all that was wanting towards their deliverance was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by the ſucceſs of the Engliſh army in more diſtant quarters, and by the peace, in which ſo valuable and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed an ally was not neglected. There never was proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſo heavy a ſtorm of national calamity, ready to fall upon an unprovided people, ſo happily averted, or ſo ſpeedily blown over. Every thing, at the beginning of this cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, bore the moſt louring and ominous aſpect to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Great Britain. As it advanced, the ſky continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cleared up; and the fortune of no nation, towards the cloſe of it, was enlivened with a more brilliant and more unclouded proſperity. We ſhall now proceed in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe ſucceſſes, and of the progreſs of the Engliſh arms in other parts of the world, where new ſcenes of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and honour were now opened to them.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>TOwards the cloſe of the laſt year, it was determined to reſume the ſcheme of operations in the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; where nothing had been attempted ſince the year 1759. Diſtreſſed as the French trade to their iſlands had been, it ſtill continued a reſource to that nation. On the other hand, nothing could poſſibly furniſh us with places of more importance, either to retain, or to exchange upon a peace, than our ſucceſs in this part of the world. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration had probably no ſmall ſhare in directing our arms towards that quarter. From the time that the diſpoſitions of Spain had become equivocal, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to take ſuch ſteps, as would put us in a reſpectable ſituation, in caſe a war with that kingdom ſhould become unavoidable. It was therefore very proper to have a ſtrong armament in the Weſt Indies, that ſide on which Spain is moſt vulnerable, and in which every wound affects a part of the quickeſt ſenſibility. Accordingly the force which was ſent into the Weſt Indies on this occaſion was very great; and, if we take the naval and military together, it was ſuch an armament as had never been before ſeen in that part of the world. It was certainly very right to leave as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to hazard as poſſible; and when, in the moſt frugal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of proceeding, a great many men muſt have been employed, and a great deal of money ſpent, it would have been an unpardonable error, from a conſideration of almoſt any ſaving, to have left any thing imperfect; eſpecially at a time, when the effect of every operation became almoſt hourly, more and more critical and deciſive.</p>
                        <p>Every thing which had been an object of war in North America, was by tnis time completely acquired. It was therefore eaſy to draw a very conſiderable part of the army from thence. Eleven battalions were drawn from New York; a draught was alſo made from the garriſon of
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:1261701201:540"/>
Belleiſle. Theſe were reinforced by ſome troops which had been ſcattered among the Leeward Iſlands; ſo that the whole land armament did not fall very ſhort of twelve thouſand men. General Monckton, who had acquired ſo much reputation in North America, and had received a very grievous wound at the taking of Quebec, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the land forces in this expedition. The marine was under rear-admiral Rodney.</p>
                        <p>The failure in 1759 did not diſcourage our adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from making Martinico the object of another attempt. The Engliſh fleet, after having rendezvouzed at Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, came before this iſland on the 7th of January, 1762. The troops landed at a creek called <hi>Cas Navire</hi> without the loſs of a man; the fleet having been diſpoſed ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and having directed their fire with ſuch effect, that the enemy was obliged in a ſhort time to abandon the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries they had erected to defend this inlet.</p>
                        <p>When the landing was effected, the difficulties were far from being at an end. It is true, that neither the number nor the quality of the enemy's regular troops in the iſland were very formidable. But the militia was numerous, well armed, and not unqualified for ſervice in the only kind of war, which could be carried on in their country. Beſides, the whole country was a natural fortification, from the number of ravines with rivulets between them, which lay from diſtance to diſtance. Wherever theſe grounds were practicable, the French had poſted guards, and erected batteries. It is eaſy from hence to diſcern what obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the progreſs of an army was liable to, particularly with regard to its artillery. Theſe obſtructions were no where greater than in the neighbourhood of the place, againſt which the firſt regular attack was propoſed.</p>
                        <p>This town and citadel is overlooked and commanded by two very conſiderable eminences, called <hi>Morne Tortenſon</hi> and <hi>Morne Garnier.</hi> Whilſt the enemy kept poſſeſſion of theſe eminences, it was impoſſible to attack the town; if they loſt them, it would prove impoſſible to defend it. Suitable to the importance of thoſe ſituations were the meaſures taken to render them impregnable. They were protected, like the other high grounds in this iſland, with very deep ravines; and this great natural ſtrength was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by every contrivance of art. The <hi>Morne Tortenſon</hi> was firſt to be attacked. To favour this operation; a

body of regular troops and marines were ordered to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance on the right along the ſea-ſide, towards the town, in order to take the redoubts which lay in the lower grounds. A thouſand ſailors in flat-bottomed boats, rowed cloſe to the ſhore to aſſiſt them. On the left, towards the country, a corps of light infantry, properly ſupported, was to get round the enemy's left; whilſt the attack in the centre was made by the Britiſh grenadiers and the body of the army, under the fire of batteries, which had been erected on the oppoſite ſide with great labour and perſeverance; the cannon having been dragged upwards of three miles by the ſeamen.</p>
                        <p>The diſpoſitions for the attack of this difficult poſt hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been made with ſo much judgment on the part of the commander, it was executed with equal ſpirit and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the ſoldiery. The attack ſucceeded in every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. With irreſiſtable impetuoſity the enemy's works were ſucceſſively carried. They were driven from poſt to poſt; until our troops, after a ſharp ſtruggle, remained maſters of the whole Morne; ſome of the enemy fled precipitately into the town, to the very entrance of which they were purſued. Others ſaved themſelves on the Morne Garnier, which was as ſtrong, and much higher than Morne Torten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and overlooked and commanded it. Thus far had they proceeded with ſucceſs; but nothing deciſive could be done, without the poſſeſſion of the other eminence, our troops being much moleſted by the enemy from that ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ſituation.</p>
                        <p>It was three days before proper diſpoſitions could be made for driving them from this ground. Whilſt theſe diſpoſitions were making, the enemy's whole force deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the hill, ſallied out of the town, and attacked the Engliſh in their advanced poſts; but they were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately repulſed: and the ardour of the Britiſh troops hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them forward, they improved a defenſive advantage into an attack, paſſed the ravines, mingled with the enemy, ſcaled the hill, ſeized the batteries, and poſted themſelves on the ſummit of Morne Garnier. The French regular troops eſcaped into the town. The militia diſperſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the country.</p>
                        <p>All the ſituations which commanded the town and cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del were now ſecured;

 and the enemy waited no longer than until the batteries againſt them were

completed to capitulate, and to ſurrender this important place, the ſecond in the iſland.

                                    <p>I HAVE the honour to acquaint your lordſhip, that we left <hi>Barbadoes</hi> the 5th Inſtant, anchored in <hi>St. Anne</hi>'s bay in this iſland the 7th, the ſhips of war having ſilenced ſome batteries which the enemy had erected there, and where I was in hopes to have been able to have landed on the weſtern ſide of the bay, and to have croſſed over to Port Royal bay; but the difficulties that would have attended our being ſupplied with proviſions and ſtores, added to the ſcarcity of freſh water in that part, made me deſiſt. I then thought that if I could get poſſeſſion of <hi>Pidgeon Iſland,</hi> a ſecure anchorage might be had for the fleet and tranſports in <hi>Port Royal</hi> harbour. For this purpoſe, I detached two brigades of the army, under the command of brigadiers <hi>Haviland</hi> and <hi>Grant,</hi> to <hi>Ance Darlet,</hi> where they landed, and marched to the ground oppoſite to the iſland; but finding the road impaſſable for cannon, which were neceſſary for the reduction of that iſland, I judged it beſt for his majeſty's ſervice, to proceed (having previouſly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitred the ſhore) and land near the <hi>Caſe des Navires;</hi> which we effected on the 16th, without any moleſtation, the ſhips of war having ſilenced the batteries above us. I had forgot, my lord, to mention, that with the above command, were the light infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try under lieutenant colonel <hi>Scott,</hi> who were advanced the night the command remained there, and were attacked in the night by three companies of grenadiers, ſome free-booters, negroes and mulattoes, which the enemy had paſſed over from <hi>Fort Royal;</hi> but they were ſo warmly received, that they retreated precipitately, leaving ſome dead; and a ſerjeant and three of their grenadiers taken priſoners, without any loſs on our ſide.</p>
                                    <p>We are now encamped upon the heights, above <hi>Caſe des Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vires;</hi> and I was in hopes, before this time, to have given your lordſhip more ſatisfactory accounts of our operations. But the ravines or gullys we have to paſs, are of ſuch depth and difficulty of acceſs, and that in the face of many batteries and redoubts, with the whole country, as well mulattoes and negroes, as inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants in arms, and without being able to procure any material intelligence, that I do not think it prudent to expoſe his majeſty's troops until I can erect batteries to cover them, which we are at work upon with the utmoſt expedition.</p>
                                    <p>However, my lord, I have the pleaſure to acquaint you, that the troops continue healthy, although they have been neceſſarily expoſed to laying on their arms, and are in the higheſt ſpirits; and I don't in the leaſt doubt, but that I ſhall be able to execute this principal object of his majeſty's commands, of which I ſhall give your lordſhip the earlieſt notice.</p>
                                    <p>It gives me great pleaſure to acquaint your lordſhip, how much I am indebted to admiral <hi>Rodney,</hi> for the aſſiſtance received from the fleet under his command: the utmoſt harmony has ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted hitherto, and I am perſuaded will continue to do ſo.</p>
                                    <p>This will be delivered to your lordſhip by captain <hi>Walſingham,</hi> who takes home the admiral's diſpatches.</p>

, or gully, which ſeperated us from them.</p>
                                    <p>My diſpoſition for the attack being made on the 24th of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> at break of day the troops advanced under a briſk fire of our batteries. The grenadiers under brigadier <hi>Grant</hi> firſt falling in with the enemy's advanced poſts, began the attack: brigadier <hi>Rufane</hi> on the right, with his brigade, and the marines, was to advance and attack the redoubts along the coaſt; 1000 ſeamen in the flat-bottomed boats, rowed us as he advanced: Lord <hi>Rollo</hi>'s brigade ſupported the grenadiers: Brigadier <hi>Walſh</hi> with his bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade, (ſupporting the light infantry under lieutenant colonel <hi>Scott</hi>) to attack the left of a plantation, and to endeavour to get round the enemy. The light infantry effected their attempt, and while the grenadiers were driving the enemy from poſt to poſt, they got upon their left, which helped to complete the event of the day. The enemy's works were now ſucceſſively attacked with the moſt irreſiſtible impetuoſity, ſo that at nine o'clock we were in the entire poſſeſſion of all their works, and the ſtrong ground of <hi>Morne Tartenſon,</hi> conſiſting of many redoubts mounted with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and advantageouſly ſituated to aſſiſt the natural ſtrength of the country. The enemy retired in the greateſt confuſion, to the town of <hi>Fort Royal,</hi> and to <hi>Morne Garnier</hi> (a ſtill higher hill than the <hi>Morne Tartenſon,</hi> and ſeperated from it by a deep ravine, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a very thick bruſh, and a rivulet at the bottom) from whence they thought they were never to be diſlodged, both from its natural ſtrength, and the works and batteries they had on it. The ſpirit of the grenadiers in this attack was ſuch, that ſome of them even purſued the enemy to the bridge of the town, and brought off priſoners from thence.</p>
                                    <p>While this was doing on this ſide, brigadier <hi>Haviland</hi> with his brigade, two battalions of <hi>Highlanders,</hi> and a corps of light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry (which I had formed from the ſeveral regiments and given the command of to major <hi>Leland</hi>) had orders (from the reported practicability of the paſſage) to croſs the ravine a good deal to the left, and attack a body of the enemy who were poſted on ſeveral heights oppoſite to him, and to try to get into their left; and by that means divide their force. Yet, although they began their march at two o'clock in the morning ſuch was the difficulty of acceſs, though I am convinced every means were tried, that it was late before they effected it.</p>
                                    <p>When I found that the enemy were giving way on all ſides, I ordered lieutenant colonel <hi>Scott</hi>'s light infantry, brigadier <hi>Walſh</hi>'s brigade, and a diviſion of the grenadiers, to a plantation more to the left, where brigadier <hi>Haviland</hi> was to have come down: they drove off ſome of the enemy poſted there; and the light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry poſſeſſed themſelves of a very advantageous poſt oppoſite to <hi>Morne Garnier.</hi> To ſupport them, I ordered brigadier <hi>Havi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s corps (which now had paſſed) to their right: the diviſion of grenadiers under brigadier Grant, and <hi>Walſh</hi>'s brigade, kept poſſeſſion of the upper plantation, and communicated with <hi>Havi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s corps. The marines, which I had taken from brigadier <hi>Rufane,</hi> I poſted to cover the road between the two plantations.</p>
                                    <p>On the 25th, we began to erect batteries on <hi>Morne Tartenſon,</hi> againſt the citadel of <hi>Fort Royal,</hi> but were much annoyed on that, and the following day, by the enemy from <hi>Morne Garnier.</hi> Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was abſolute neceſſary to attack this place to the left, where the corps of light infantry, and brigadier <hi>Haviland</hi>'s bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade were poſted, I determined immediately to errect batteries againſt theſe of the enemy which annoyed us, and which might alſo cover our paſſage of the ravine.</p>
                                    <p>On the 27th, about four o'clock in the evening, the enemy, under cover of their batteries, and with the greateſt part of their force, had the temerity to attack the two corps of light infantry, and brigadier <hi>Haviland</hi>'s brigade, in the poſts they occupied; but were received with ſuch ſteadineſs, that they were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately repulſed; and ſuch was the ardour of the troops, that they paſſed the ravine with the enemy, ſeized their batteries, and took poſt there, being reinforced by brigadier <hi>Walſh</hi>'s brigade, and the diviſion of grenadiers under brigadier <hi>Grant,</hi> who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately on the attack had marched to ſupport them. Night was now come on; but major <hi>Leland</hi> moving on to the left with his light infantry, and finding no oppoſition, continued his rout to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the enemy's redoubts, which he ſoon came up to, and took poſſeſſion of the enemy (except a few grenadiers, who were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners) having abandoned them. Their troops retired into the town and citadel, and the militia diſperſed in the country. Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers <hi>Walſh, Grant</hi> and <hi>Haviland,</hi> immediately moved up to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the light infantry: ſo that at nine o'clock at night, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's troops were in poſſeſſion of this very ſtrong poſt, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely commanded the citadel. So precipitate was the enemy's flight, that they left a mortar loaded, and 8 or 9 guns unſpiked, with a quantity of ammunition and proviſions. The cannon and mortar were turned againſt the citadel in the morning.</p>
                                    <p>Having gained this advantageous poſt, from which the enemy had ſo much annoyed us and having completed two batteries on <hi>Morne Tartenſon,</hi> conſiſting of fourteen guns and three mortars, we opened them on the 30th: but finding that the diſtance was too great, and having now <hi>Morne Capuchine</hi> in our power, not more than 400 yards diſtant from the fort, as well as the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the town, I immediately reſolved to erect batteries at both theſe places, the ſooner to reduce the citadel; but for the eaſier conveyance of our cannon by water, I ordered major <hi>Leland,</hi> with his light infantry, to take poſt on the river <hi>monſieur.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The enemy perceiving our deſigns, and for reaſons beſt known to themſelves, on the evening of the 3d inſtant, beat the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made; in conſequence of which, the gate of the citadel was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up to his majeſty's troops the evening of the 4th, and at nine o'clock next morning the garriſon marched out, on the terms of the capitulation. It conſiſted of about 800 men, grenadiers, marines, militia, and free-booters. About 150 of the garriſon were killed and wounded in the ſiege. The enemy might have kept us much longer, as it would have been abſolutely neceſſary to have made two or three breaches, which muſt have taken ſome time.</p>
                                    <p>In the ſeveral attacks, I am credibly informed, that the enemy had not leſs than 1000 men killed, wounded, and taken priſoners: among the latter, ſeveral of their principal officers of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, taken the 24th. Our loſs your lordſhip will ſee by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. You have alſo my lord, a return of the artillery and ſtores taken from the enemy on the 24th and 27th of January; and in the citadel at its ſurrender on the 5th inſtant.</p>
                                    <p>I cannot find words, my lord, to render that ample juſtice due to the true valour and perſevering ardour of his majeſty's troops, which I have the honour to command. The difficulties they had to encounter in the attack of an enemy, poſſeſſed of every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that art or nature could give them, were great. Their perſeverance, in ſurmounting theſe obſtacles, furniſhes a noble example of Britiſh ſpirit.</p>
                                    <p>The brigadiers Haviland, Grant, Rufane, Lord Rollo, and Walſh, and all the officers in general, deſerve the higheſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe for their animated and ſoldierlike conduct.</p>
                                    <p>The grenadiers of the army, in three diviſions, headed by the lieutenant colonels Fletcher, Maſſy, and Vaughan, and the light infantry and rangers, in three bodies, commanded by lieutenant colonel Scott, major Leland, and captain Kennedy, particularly diſtinguiſhing themſelves, the warmeſt part of the ſervice having fallen to their lot.</p>
                                    <p>M. la Touche the governor general, after leaving a garriſon in <hi>Fort Royal,</hi> retired with the remains of his grenadiers, and is now, as I am informed, at <hi>St. Pierre.</hi> We have not as yet had the leaſt correſpondence together, nor has he ſo much as ſent to enquire after his killed, wounded, and priſoners.</p>
                                    <p>Immediately upon the fort ſurrendering, the admiral and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a deputation from moſt of the quarters of the iſland, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring likewiſe to capitulate, M. La Touche having refuſed them to enter into any terms. On the 7th inſtant we agreed upon the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations, to which we have every day ſome of the other quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the iſland acceding. <hi>St. Pierre,</hi> and the neighbouring quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are the only ones which hold out, owing to the preſence of M. La Touche; but ſhould they not come in, in a day or two, which I am told I may expect every hour, I purpoſe moving that way, and do not the leaſt doubt but that I ſhall ſoon reduce them to reaſon.</p>
                                    <p>On the 7th inſtant, <hi>Pidgeon Iſland,</hi> one of the defences of this harbour, ſurrendered by ſummons on the ſame terms of the citadel, (cannon excepted.)</p>
                                    <p>Your lordſhip may look upon the capitulation for the iſland as fixed, the admiral and myſelf being reſolved not to make the leaſt alteration. The other quarters muſt accede to it.</p>
                                    <p>We hope both the capitulations will receive his majeſty's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, as it has been our earneſt ſtudy to obtain, on our part, every advantage to the nation, that could accrue from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of this iſland.</p>
                                    <p>The day after the affair of the 27th, learning from one of my parties that <hi>M. Nadau Deutruil,</hi> late the <hi>French</hi> governor of the iſland of <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> was at a houſe about two leagues from my quarters, I thought it neceſſary to ſend, and bring him in, and he is now with me a priſoner. I purpoſe ſending him to <hi>France</hi> by ſome opportunity that may offer hereafter. The <hi>French</hi> troops are all aboard, and will ſoon ſail for <hi>France</hi> according to the capitulation.</p>
                                    <p>I have given orders for the repair of the citadel, and for every neceſſary work. The inhabitants, who had all quitted their houſes, and retired to the heights, are now returning to them; and as ſoon as I have fixed the inhabitants of St. <hi>Pierre,</hi> I ſhall purſue the other parts of his majeſty's inſtructions.</p>
                                    <p>I muſt repeat to your lordſhip the harmony that ſubſiſts between the fleet and army, and the cordial aſſiſtance we have received from admiral <hi>Rodney,</hi> in every part of the operations where his aid could be uſeful.</p>
                                    <p>This will be delivered to your lordſhip by major <hi>Gates,</hi> one of my aid-de-camps, who will inform your lordſhip of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars you may deſire to know. I muſt beg leave to recommend him to his majeſty's favour, as a very deſerving officer, and who has now ſerved upwards of twelve years in <hi>America</hi> with much credit.</p>

                                    </p>
                                    <p>The almoſt inſurmountable difficulties the troops had to ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with, and the ſurprizing ſtrength of the country, improved by all that art could add, will be beſt explained by general <hi>Monckton.</hi> But this I muſt ſay, in juſtice to thoſe I have the honour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that the intrepidity and gallant behaviour of the officers and troops employed on this expedition, could be equalled only by the eager and chearful activity of the officers and ſeamen; who contributed every thing in their power towards the reduction of the place, and made no difficulties in tranſporting numbers of the heavieſt mortars and ſhips cannon, up the ſteepeſt mountains, at a very conſiderable diſtance from the ſea, and acroſs the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's line of fire.</p>
                                    <p>I have the pleaſure to acquaint their lordſhips, that we have taken, in this port, fourteen of the enemy's beſt privateers; and many more which are in the other ports of the iſland, will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately delivered into my hands, agreeable to the capitulation of the inhabitants: and for all further particulars, I muſt refer their lordſhips to captain <hi>Darby,</hi> who is charged with theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches.</p>
                                    <p>It gives me the ſincereſt ſatisfaction, that I can aſſure their lordſhips, the moſt perfect harmony has ſubſiſted between the navy and army, each vying (in the moſt friendly manner) which ſhould ſerve his majeſty and their country beſt.</p>

                                    <p>Juſt when I was about to embark for the reduction of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s two deputies arrived at <hi>Fort Royal</hi> on the 12th inſt. offering terms of capitulation for the whole iſland, on the part of M. <hi>La Vaſſor Delatouche,</hi> the Governor-General on the 13th. They received the Admiral's and my anſwers, to their propoſals, which they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s; and on the 14th returned with the capitulation ſigned. In conſequence of which, I left <hi>Fort Royal</hi> on the 15th, with the grenadiers of the army, and the 2d brigade; and on the following day took poſſeſſion of this large and opulent town, with all the poſts in the neighbourhood. The enemy marched out about 320 grenadiers, who are embarked, and will ſail immediately for <hi>France.</hi> M. <hi>Le Vaſſor Delatouche,</hi> the Governor-General, M. <hi>Rouille,</hi> Lieutenant Governor, and the ſtaff will ſhortly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                                    <p>Incloſed I ſend your Lordſhip a copy of the capitulation for the iſland, which we humbly hope will meet with his Majeſty's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. Commodore <hi>Swanton</hi> is now off the <hi>Grenades</hi> with a ſquadron of men of war; and I propoſe ſending immediately Brig. Gen. <hi>Walſh</hi> with the 5th brigade, and the corps of light infantry under Lieut. Col. <hi>Scott,</hi> in order to reduce that and the other iſlands. I have undoubted intelligence, that the number of white men in the <hi>Grenades</hi> do not exceed 500; and in the other iſlands not quite ſo many.</p>
                                    <p>I ſhould have proceeded upon this ſervice myſelf, had I not thought it of more conſequence, for his Majeſty's ſervice, my remaining here at this critical time, when, by what we can learn, a rupture with <hi>Spain</hi> may be daily expected; and here I am alſo at hand to ſettle many material affairs relative to the ſecurity of this conqueſt.</p>
                                    <p>Indeed, I have good reaſon to believe, that Brig. <hi>Walſh</hi> will meet with very little obſtruction in his operations. However, ſhould he not immediately ſucceed, I ſhall move that way with a larger force, and make no doubt to compel them to a ſpeedy ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render.</p>
                                    <p>It was not my intention to have ſent home an expreſs until I could have informed your Lordſhip of the reduction of the other iſlands mentioned in his Majeſty's inſtructions.— But as this iſland is now completely reduced to his Majeſty's obedience, I was apprehenſive that a delay, in ſignifying this intereſting event, might be attended with ſome bad conſequences at this critical juncture. I therefore ſend this by my Aid-de-Camp. Captain <hi>Ricaut,</hi> who can inform your Lordſhip of any particulars you may deſire to know; and I beg leave to recommend him to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's countenance, as a very deſerving and good officer.</p>
                                    <p>As it was neceſſary for his Majeſty's ſervice, immediately to fill ſome civil employments here, I have, accordingly, appointed proper perſons to act until his Majeſty's pleaſure be known.</p>
                                    <p>Your Lordſhip has, herewith, a return of the artillery, and warlike ſtores, found in the town, the <hi>Reduit,</hi> and the other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent poſts.</p>

<pb n="490" facs="tcp:1261701201:553"/>
who came to capitulate for the ſurrender of that place, and of the whole iſland.</p>
                        <p>The ſurrender of Martinico, which was the ſeat of the
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:1261701201:554"/>
ſuperior government, the principal mart of trade, and the centre of all the French force in the Caribbees, naturally drew on the ſurrender of all the dependent iſlands. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:1261701201:555"/>
a fertile iſland, and poſſeſſed of ſome good harbours, was given up without oppoſition. St. Lucia, and St. Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, the right to which had ſo long been objects of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:1261701201:556"/>
between the two nations, followed its example. The Engliſh were now the ſole and undiſturbed poſſeſſors of all the Caribbees, and held that chain of innumerable iſlands which forms an immenſe bow, extending from the eaſtern point of Hiſpaniola almoſt to the continent of South Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. And though ſome of theſe iſlands are barren, none of them very large, and not many of them well inhabited, they boaſt more trade than falls to the lot of many reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able kingdoms.</p>
                        <p>The time, in which Martinico was reduced, was a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of almoſt as much conſequence as the reduction itſelf; for the war againſt Spain having been declared in the beginning of the year, it became adviſeable to ſtrike early ſuch an effective blow againſt that nation as might incline them to a ſpeedy peace, or might influence the fortune of the whole war, if, contrary to our wiſhes, the war ſhould continue. It was, on this plan, neceſſary to employ a very great force, and, of courſe, to call away a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of that which had been employed at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinico, whilſt the ſeaſon permitted them to act.</p>
                        <p>When the Britiſh adminiſtration determined to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the war into the Spaniſh Weſt Indies, with great judgment they fixed they eyes at once upon the capital object 

<note n="(a)" place="bottom">As the merit of projecting this expedition has been variouſly related, the following particulars may not be improperly given here. —Admiral Knowles on his return from Jamaica in <hi>1756,</hi> took an opportunity of viſiting the Havanna, and inſpecting its fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, of which he made plans, and other material obſervations; theſe at the requeſt of the duke of Gumberland, were laid before him for his inſpection, who knowing the merit of the admiral as an engineer, conſulted him on the moſt probable means of putting them into execution; theſe his royal highneſs formed into a regular plan for execution, which he ſent to the miniſtry, who held them under conſideration for ſome time; however, this plan was diſapproved of by lord Anſon, then firſt lord of the Admiralty, who formed another, which was carried into execution; but as his royal high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had very early intereſted himſelf in the expedition, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of a commander of the land-force was left to him, which naturally fell on the earl of Albemarle, whom he had in a manner tutored from his earlieſt years.</note>

: and reſolved to commence their operations

where others of leſs ability would have choſen to conclude them. In an attack upon ſubordinate places, the conqueſt would not have been much more certain; when obtained, it would be far from deciſive; and a failure would have been fatal, as it would include a loſs of reputation. The failure of an armament in a ſubordinate attack is a bad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative for a greater attempt. The plan, therefore, of the war of 1740 in the Spaniſh Indies, in which we began with Porto Bello, and ſo proceeded to Carthagena, &amp;c. was mean, becauſe the ſucceſs in one of theſe attempts did nothing towards inſuring ſucceſs in the other; and if we had ſucceeded in both attempts, our advantage would have had but little influence on a third. But the plan of the war, juſt now concluded, was great and juſt; becauſe we began with the Havannah, in which the whole trade and navigation of the Spaniſh Weſt Indies center, and without which it cannot be carried on. If we ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in this conqueſt, this conqueſt alone would almoſt have finiſhed the war; becauſe it would have utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted the enemy's reſources. If we choſe to purſue our advantage, it expoſed the whole Spaniſh America.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Commanders in the expedition againſt the Havannah. Fleet ſails from Portſmouth. Paſſage through the old ſtreights of Bahama. Town and harbour of the Havannah deſcribed. Troops land. Diſpoſition of the troops. Siege of Fort Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro. Captain Harvey cannonades the Moro. Engliſh batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fired. Diſtreſs of the Engliſh forces. Succours arrive from North America. A ſally. The fort ſtormed. Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations againſt the town. The Havannah ſurrenders. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of this acquiſition.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT being determined to commence with this enterprize, ſuch commanders were to be choſen, as could be ſafely intruſted with the conduct of an undertaking ſo weighty, and on the ſucceſs of which ſo much depended. Lord Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemarle, the friend and diſciple of the duke of Cumberland, commanded the land forces. Admiral Pococke, who having contributed by his valour towards that ſovereignty which his country had obtained in the Eaſt Indies, was now choſen to extend its empire and its honour in the Weſt.</p>
                        <p>They ſailed from Portſmouth on the 5th of March, the day on which the Grenades were ſurrendered. A fleet had ſailed from Martinico under the command of that ſpirited and intelligent officer, Sir James Douglas, in order to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them. The ſquadrons very happily met, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay or diſperſion, at Cape Nichola, the north-weſt point of Hiſpaniola, on the 27th of May. After this junction, the armament amounted to nineteen ſhips of the line; eighteen ſmall veſſels of war; and near one hundred and fifty tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports, which conveyed about ten thouſand land forces. A ſupply of four thouſand had been ordered from New York, and was expected to join them very near as early as they could be ſuppoſed able to commence their operations.</p>
                        <p>There were two choices before the admiral for his courſe to the Havannah. The firſt and moſt obvious was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way, to keep to the ſouth of Cuba, and fall into the track of the galleons. But this, though by much the ſafeſt, would prove by far the moſt tedious paſſage; and delays, above all things were to be avoided, as the ſucceſs of the whole enterprize would probably depend upon its being in forwardneſs before the hurricane ſeaſon came on. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:1261701201:559"/>
reſolved to run along the northern ſhore of that iſland, purſuing his career from eaſt to weſt through a narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, not leſs than ſeven hundred miles in length, called the old ſtreights of Bahama.</p>
                        <p>This paſſage, through almoſt the whole of its extent, is bounded on the right and left by the moſt dangerous ſands and ſhoals, which render the navigation ſo hazardous, that it has uſually been avoided by ſingle and ſmall veſſels. There was no pilot in the fleet whoſe experience could be depended on to conduct them ſafely through it. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, however, determined on this paſſage; and being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with a good chart of lord Anſon's, he reſolved to truſt to his own ſagacity, conduct, and vigilance, to carry ſafely through thoſe ſtreights a fleet of near two hundred ſail. So bold an attempt had never been made; but every precaution was taken to guard this bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>dneſs from the imputation of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity. A veſſel was ſent to reconnoitre the paſſage, and, when returned, was ordered to take the lead; ſome frigates followed; ſloops and boats were ſtationed on the right and left on the ſhallows, with well adapted ſignals both for the day and the night. The fleet moved in ſeven diviſions. And being favoured with pleaſant weather, and ſecured by the admirable diſpoſitions which were made, they, without the ſmalleſt loſs or interruption, got clear thro' this perilous paſſage on the 5th of June, having entered it on the 27th of May.</p>
                        <p>The Havannah, the object of their long voyage, and of ſo many anxious hopes and fears, was now before them. This place is not denominated the capital of Cuba; St. Jago, ſituated at the ſouth-eaſt part of the iſland, has that title: but the Havannah, though the ſecond in rank, is the firſt in wealth, ſize, and importance. The harbour, upon which it ſtands, is, in every reſpect, one of the beſt in the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and perhaps in the world. It is entered by a narrow paſſage, upwards of half a mile in length, which afterwards expands into a large baſon, forming three <hi>cul de ſaes;</hi> 

                           <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Deep Bays.</note>

 and is ſufficient, in extent and depth, to contain a thouſand ſail of the largeſt ſhips, having almoſt throughout ſix fathom water, and being perfectly covered from every wind. In this bay the rich fleets from the ſeveral parts of the Spaniſh
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:1261701201:560"/>
Weſt Indies, called the Galleons and the Flota, aſſemble, before they finally ſet out on their voyage for Europe.</p>
                        <p>This circumſtance has rendered the Havannah one of the moſt opulent, flouriſhing, and populous cities in this part of the world. Great care was taken to fortify and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a place, which, by being the center of ſo rich a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, would naturally become the faireſt mark for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of an enemy. The narrow entrance into this har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is ſecured on one ſide by a very ſtrong fort, called the Moro, (C) built upon a projecting point of land: on the other, it is defended by a fort called the Puntal, (D) which joins the town. The town itſelf, which is ſituated to the weſtward of the entrance of the harbour, and oppoſite to the Moro fort, is ſurrounded by a good rampart, (AA) flanked with baſtions, and covered with a ditch.</p>
                        <p>The Spaniards, who had been for ſome time preparing for war, had formed a conſiderable navy in the Weſt Indies: this fleet, (q) which was near twenty ſail, moſtly of the line, lay at this time in the baſon of the Havannah; but they had not, when our armament appeared before the port, received, it ſeems, any authentic account from their court concerning the commencement of hoſtilities between the two nations.</p>
                        <p>Whether the Spaniards were rendered inactive by the want of inſtructions, whether all their ſhips were not in fighting condition, or whatever elſe was the cauſe, this fleet lay quiet in the harbour. If ſome of the above rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons did not oppoſe, it may be very rationally ſuppoſed, that their beſt part would have been to come out, and fight our ſquadron. They were not very far from an equality; and though the iſſue of a battle might have proved unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to them, yet a battle tolerably maintained would have much diſabled our armament, and perhaps have been a means of preventing the ſucceſs of the whole enterprize. The loſs of their fleet in this way might poſſibly have ſaved the city; but, the city, once taken, nothing could poſſibly ſave the fleet. It is true, they much truſted, and not wholly without reaſon, to the ſtrength of the place, and to thoſe aſtoniſhing difficulties which attend any military operation, that is drawn out to length in this unhealthy climate. In other reſpects, they were very far from being deficient in proper meaſures for their defence. They made a ſtrong boom (p) acroſs the mouth of the harbour; and almoſt the

                        <p>The principal body of the army was deſtined to act upon this ſide. It was divided into two corps; one of which was advanced a conſiderable way in the country, towards the ſouth-eaſt of the harbour, in order to cover the ſiege, and to ſecure our parties employed in watering and procuring proviſions. This corps was commanded by general Elliot. The other was immediately occupied in the attack on Fort Moro, (w) to the reduction of which the efforts of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh were principally directed, as the Moro commanded the town, and the entrance of the harbour. This attack was conducted by general Keppel. To make a diverſion in favour of this grand operation, a detachment, under colonel How, was encamped to the weſtward of the town. This body cut off the communication between the town and the country, and kept the enemy's attention divided. Such was the diſpoſition, and it was impoſſible to make a better, of the land forces during the whole ſiege.

                           <pb n="499" facs="tcp:1261701201:565"/>The hardſhips which the Engliſh army ſuſtained, in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the ſiege of the Moro, are almoſt inexpreſſible: the earth was every where ſo thin, that it was with great difficulty they could cover themſelves in their approaches. There was no ſpring or river near them; it was neceſſary to bring water from a great diſtance; and ſo precarious and ſcanty was this ſupply, that they were obliged to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to water from the ſhips. Roads for communication were to be cut through thick woods; the artillery was to be dragged for a vaſt way over a rough rocky ſhore. Several dropped down dead with heat, thirſt, and fatigue. But ſuch was the reſolution of our people, ſuch the happy and perfect unanimity which ſubſiſted between the land and the ſea ſervices, that no difficulties, no hardſhips, ſlackened for a moment the operations againſt this important, ſtrong, and well defended place. Batteries were, in ſpite of all difficulties, raiſed againſt the Moro, and along the hill upon which this fort ſtands, in order to drive the enemy's ſhips deeper into the harbour, and thus to prevent them from moleſting our approaches.</p>
                        <p>The enemy's fire, and that of the beſiegers, was for a long time pretty near on an equality, and it was kept up with great vivacity on both ſides. The Spaniards in the fort communicated with the town, from which they were
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:1261701201:566"/>
recruited and ſupplied; they did not rely ſolely on their works;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 29."/> 

 they made a ſally with ſufficient reſolution, and a conſiderable force, but with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſucceſs. They were obliged to retire, with a loſs of two or three hundred men left dead on the ſpot.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt theſe works were thus vigorouſly puſhed on ſhore, the navy, not contented with the great aſſiſtance which they had before lent to every part of the land ſervice, reſolved to try ſomething further, and which was more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly within their own province, towards the reduction of the Moro. Accordingly, the day the batteries on ſhore were opened, three of their greateſt ſhips, (g) the Dragon, the Cambridge, and the Marlborough, under the conduct of capt. Harvey, laid their broadſides againſt the fort,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 1."/> 

 and began a terrible fire, which was returned with great obſtinacy. This firing, one of the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ever ſeen, continued for ſeven hours, without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But in this cannonade the Moro, which was ſituated upon a very high and ſteep rock, had great advantages over the ſhips, and was proof againſt all their efforts. Beſides, the fire from the oppoſite fort of Puntal, and the batteries of the town, galled them extremely. Inſomuch that, in order to ſave the ſhips from abſolute deſtruction, they were obliged at length, tho' unwilling, to bring them all off. Even this retreat was not effected without difficulty, as the ſhips were very much ſhattered in this long and unequal conteſt. They had one hundred and fifty men killed and wounded; and one of the captains, captain Gooſtrey of the Marlborough, a brave and experienced officer, was alſo killed. The captains Harvey and Burnett gained, with better fortune, an equal honour, by their firm and intrepid behaviour throughout the whole operation.</p>
                        <p>This bold attempt, though it had very little effect upon the works on that ſide of the fort which the ſhips attacked, was nevertheleſs of conſiderable ſervice. The enemy's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention being diverted to that ſide, the other was a good deal neglected: our fire was poured in the mean time with redoubled fury from the batteries; it became much ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to that of the enemy, and did no ſmall damage to their works. But the moment the Spaniards were releaſed from their attention to our men of war, they returned again to the eaſtward face of the fort: their defence was revived with as much vigour as before; on both ſides a conſtant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitted
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:1261701201:567"/>
fire was kept up, with a fierce emulation, for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days. It now became evident, that the reduction of this fortreſs was to be a work of time. Never, from the beginning of the war, had the Engliſh valour been ſo well matched. Here was at length an adverſary worthy of our arms, and our whole military ſkill and ſpirit was put to the ſevereſt trial.</p>
                        <p>In the midſt of this ſharp and doubtful contention, the capital battery againſt the fort unfortunately took fire;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 3."/> 

 and being chiefly conſtructed of timber and faſcines dried by the intenſe heats and continual cannonade, the flames ſoon got a-head, and became too powerful for oppoſition. The battery was almoſt wholly conſumed. The labour of ſix hundred men, for ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days, was deſtroyed in a moment; and all was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin anew.</p>
                        <p>This was a mortifying ſtroke. It was felt the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, becauſe the other hardſhips of the ſiege were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by this time almoſt inſupportable. The ſickneſs, ſomething of which the troops had brought with them from Martinico, and which increaſed infinitely in this unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome country and rigorous ſervice, had reduced the army to half its number, at the ſame time that it doubled the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue of thoſe few who ſtill preſerved ſome remains of ſtrength. Five thouſand ſoldiers were at one, time down in various diſtempers; no leſs than three thouſand of the ſeamen were in the ſame miſerable condition. A total want of good proviſions exaſperated the diſeaſe, and retarded the recovery. The deficiency of water was of all their grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the greateſt, and extremely aggravated all the reſt of their ſufferings. The procuring from a diſtance this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſupply, ſo unequal to their wants, exhauſted all their force. Beſides, as the ſeaſon advanced, the proſpect of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding grew fainter. The hearts of the moſt ſanguine ſunk within them, whilſt they beheld this gallant army waſting away by diſeaſes; and they could not avoid, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling for that noble fleet, which had rid ſo long on an open ſhore, and which muſt to all appearance, be expoſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable ruin, if the hurricane ſeaſon ſhould come on before the reduction of the place. A thouſand languiſhing and impatient looks were caſt out for the reinforcement from North America. None however as yet appeared; and the exhauſted army was left to its own endeavours. Many fell
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:1261701201:568"/>
into deſpair, and died, overcome with fatigue, anguiſh and diſappointment.</p>
                        <p>But in the midſt of theſe cruel delays and diſtreſſes, the ſteadineſs of the commanders infuſed life and activity into their troops, and rouſed them to incredible exertions. The rich prize, which was before them; the ſhame of returning home baffled; and even the ſtrenuous reſiſtance which was made by the enemy; all theſe motives called loudly on their intereſt, their honour, and their pride, and obliged them to the exertion of every nerve. Nobody could imagine that it was this reduced and ſlender army, by which theſe aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing efforts were made, and this extenſive ſphere of duty ſo perfectly filled. New batteries aroſe in the place of the old; the fire ſoon became equal, and then ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to that of the enemy.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 20."/> 

 They by degrees ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced the cannon of the fort, beat to pieces all the upper works, and made at length a lodgment in the covered way. There hopes were now become more lively. Some days before they had gained this grand advantage,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 12."/> 

 the Jamaica fleet appeared in its paſſage to Europe, with ſeveral conveniences for the ſiege. Not many days after this they received a conſiderable part of the New York reinforcement.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 28."/> 

 Some of the tranſports in their paſſage thro' the old Bahama Streights were loſt, but the men were ſaved on the adjacent iſlands.</p>
                        <p>Theſe favourable events infuſed double life into their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, in this advanced ſtate of the ſiege; but a new and grand difficulty appeared, juſt at the ſeeming accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their work. An immenſe ditch yawned before them, for the greater part cut in the ſolid rock, eighty feet deep, and forty feet wide. To fill it up by any means appeared impoſſible. Difficult as the work of mining was in thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, it was the only expedient. It might have been an impracticable one, if fortunately a thin ridge of rock had not been left, in order to cover the ditch towards the ſea. On this narrow ridge,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 20."/> 

 the miners wholly uncovered, but with very little loſs, paſſed the ditch, and ſoon buried themſelves in the wall.</p>
                        <p>It now became viſible to the governor of the Havannah, that the fort muſt be ſpeedily reduced: if left to its own ſtrength. At all events ſomething muſt be done in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igence
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:1261701201:569"/>
for its immediate relief. Accordingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore break of day a body of twelve hundred men,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 22."/> 

 moſtly compoſed of the country militia, Mulattoes and Negroes, were tranſported acroſs the harbour, climbed the hills, and made three attacks upon our poſts. But the ordinary guards, though ſurpriſed, defended themſelves ſo reſolutely, that the Spaniards made little impreſſion, and were not able to ruin any part of the approaches. The poſts attacked were ſpeedily reinforced, and the enemy, who were little better than a diſorderly rabble, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by proper officers, fell into terror and confuſion. They were driven precipitately down the hill with great ſlaughter; ſome gained their boats, others were drowned, and they loſt in this well imagined, but ill executed ſally, upwards of four hundred men.</p>
                        <p>This was the laſt effort for the relief of the Moro; which, abandoned as it was by the city, and while an enemy was undermining its walls, held out with a ſullen reſolution, and made no ſort of propoſal to capitulate. The mines at length did their buſineſs.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 30."/> 

 A part of the wall was blown up, and fell into the ditch; leaving a breach, which tho' very narrow and difficult, the general and engineer judged practicable. The Engliſh troops, who were commanded on the moſt dangerous of all ſervices, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced that it was to be the end of labours much more grievous to them. They mounted the breach, entered the fort, and formed themſelves with ſo much celerity, and with ſuch a ſpirited coolneſs of reſolution, that the enemy, who were drawn up to receive them, and who might have made the aſſault an affair of great bloodſhed, aſtoniſhed at their countenance, fled on all hands. About four hundred were ſlaughtered on the ſpot, or ran to the water where they periſhed. Four hundred more threw down their arms, and obtained quarter. The ſecond in command, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de Gonſales, fell while he was making brave, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual efforts to animate and rally his people. Don Lewis de Velaſco, the governor, who had hitherto defended the fort with ſuch obſtinate bravery, ſeemed reſolved in this extremity to ſhare the ſame fate with it. He collected an hundred men in an entrenchment he had made round his colours. But ſeeing that all his companions were fled from him, or ſlaughtered about him, diſdaining to retire or call for quarter, he received a mortal wound, and fell, offering

his ſword to his conquerors. The Engliſh wept with pity and admiration over that unfortunate valour, which had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned them ſo many toilſome hours, and coſt them ſo many lives.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Moro came into our poſſeſſion after a vigorous ſtruggle, forty-four days from the time the firſt operations had been begun againſt it. No time was loſt to profit of this great advantage, notwithſtanding that the ſickneſs ſtill raged like a peſtilence, and that many new and great works were to be undertaken. Not only the fire of the fort was turned againſt the town, but a line of batteries (l) was erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along the hill of the Cavannos, on the extremity of which the fort ſtands. By theſe batteries which mounted three and forty pieces of cannon, and twelve mortars, almoſt the whole eaſtern ſide of the city was commanded from one end to the other. Preparations for an attack were alſo made, and batteries erected to the weſtward of the town, which on that ſide had hitheto been only watched. Some time before a part of the ſecond diviſion of the troops from North America had arrived.

 A part had been taken by a ſquadron of French men of war; but thoſe who eſcaped, came very ſeaſonably, and were of ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſervice.</p>
                        <p>When thoſe preparations were perfectly ready to take effect,

 lord Albemarle by a meſſage repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the governor the irreſiſtible force of the attack, which he was ready to make upon the town, but which, in order to avoid unneceſſary effuſion of blood, he was willing to ſuſpend, that the Spaniards might have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to capitulate. The governor in a reſolute but civil manner returned, that he would defend the place committed to him to the laſt extremity, and began inſtantly to fire.</p>
                        <p>To convince the governor that the menaces employed were not an empty boaſt, lord Albemarle the very next morning ordered a general fire from the batteries, which was poured from all ſides, with ſuch continued and irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fury, that in ſix hours almoſt all the enemy's guns were ſilenced. To the inexpreſſible joy of the fleet and army, flags of truce appeared from every quarter of the town. A capitulation enſued, in which the eſtabliſhed religion, the former laws, and private property were ſecured to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. The garriſon, which was reduced to about ſeven hundred men had the honours of war, and were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:1261701201:571"/>
to Spain. A diſtrict of an hundred and eighty miles weſtward of the Havannah was yielded along with the town. The Spaniards ſtruggled a long time to ſave the men of war; but this was a capital point, and wholly inadmiſſible. They alſo made ſome attempts to have the harbour declared neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral during the war; but this was no leſs eſſential to the completeneſs of the conqueſt, and was ſteadily refuſed. After two days altercation, they gave up theſe points, and the Engliſh troops were put in poſſeſſion of the Havannah on the 14th of Auguſt, when they had been before it two months and eight days.</p>
                        <p>Although we have not purſued in exact order all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of the more minute operations of this memorable ſiege, we have dwelt on it a longer time, than we have on our plan generally allowed to ſuch tranſactions; becauſe it was, without queſtion, in itſelf the moſt conſiderable, and in its conſequences the moſt deciſive conqueſt we have made ſince the beginning of the war; and becauſe in no operation were the courage, ſteadineſs, and perſeverance of the Britiſh troops and the conduct of their leaders more conſpicious. The acquiſiton of this place united in itſelf all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which can be acquired in war. It was a military ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the higheſt claſs; it was equal to the greateſt naval victory, by its effect on the enemy's marine; and in the plunder it equalled the produce of a national ſubſidy. Nine ſail of the enemy's ſhips of the line, ſome of the fineſt veſſels in the world, were taken, with four frigates. Three of their capital ſhips had been, as already mentioned, ſunk by themſelves at the beginning of the ſiege; two more were in forwardneſs on the ſtocks, and theſe were deſtroyed by the Engliſh. The enemy, on this occaſion, loſt a whole fleet. In ready money, in the tobacco collected at the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah on account of the king of Spain, and in other valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able merchandizes, the plunder did not perhaps fall ſhort of three millions ſterling

                                    <p>Incloſed is a copy of the capitulation, various returns, and the chief engineer's continuation of the journal of the ſiege of the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our mines were ſprung about one o'clock, and a breach made juſt practicable for a file of men in front.

The governor hung out the white flag, and beat a parley; and at the ſame time ſent out an officer to propoſe a ceſſation of arms for twenty-four hours in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to prepare the articles of capitulation.</p>
                                    <p>I ſent on board the <hi>Namur</hi> to the Admiral, to inform him of the governor's propoſals.</p>
                                    <p>Sir <hi>George Pocock</hi> immediately came to my quarters, and we agreed to a ſuſpenſion of hoſtilities to the 13th at twelve o'clock.</p>
                                    <p>I ſummoned the governor on the 10th. His anſwer was very civil and proper; at the ſame time ſaid he would defend his town to the laſt extremity.</p>
                                    <p>The difficulties the officers and ſoldiers have met with, and the fatigues they have ſo chearfully and reſolutely gone through ſince the army firſt landed on this iſland, are not to be deſcribed. They deſerve from me the greateſt commendations; and I muſt intreat your lordſhip to take the firſt opportunity of informing his majeſty how much I think myſelf obliged to lieut. general <hi>Elliot,</hi> and the reſt of the general officers under my command; to every officer and ſoldier in the army; and to the officers and ſailors of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's fleet, for the zealous manner with which they have carried on the ſervice, and for the great aſſiſtance I have received from them. Happy we ſhall all think ourſelves, if our conduct meets with his majeſty's approbation.</p>
                                    <p>Sir <hi>George Pocock</hi> and commodore <hi>Keppel</hi> have exerted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a moſt particular manner: And I may venture to ſay, that there never was a joint undertaking carried on with more harmony and zeal on both ſides, which greatly contributed to the ſucceſs of it.</p>

                                       <salute>SIR,</salute>
                                    </opener>
                                    <p>I Deſire you will acquaint their Lordſhips, that it is with the greateſt pleaſure I now congratulate them on the great ſucceſs of his majeſty's arms, in the reduction of the Havannah with all its dependencies.</p>
                                    <p>The <hi>Moro</hi> fort was taken by ſtorm on the 30th of laſt month, after a ſiege of twenty-nine days; during which time the enemy loſt above a thouſand men, and a brave officer in Don <hi>Lewis de Valaſco,</hi> captain of one of their men of war, and governor in the <hi>Moro,</hi> mortally wounded in defending the colours ſword in hand in the ſtorm: And on the 11th inſtant, the governor of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah deſired to capitulate for the town, which was granted, the articles agreed to, and ſigned, (a copy of which I encloſe) and we were put in poſſeſſion of the Punta and land gate the 14th. With this great and important acquiſition to his majeſty, have alſo fallen twelve men of war of the line, as per liſt, three of which were ſunk, with a company's ſhip, in the entrance of the harbour; nine are fit for ſea, and two on the ſtocks; a blow that I hope will prove the more capital to the enemy, as they receive it ſo early in the war; and, I may venture to ſay, will leave all their ſettlements, in this part of the world, expoſed to any attempts that may be thought proper to be made on them. But however trivial, with the poſſeſſion of the Havannah, it may appear, yet I cannot help mentioning the diſcovery and poſſeſſing of the harbour of Mariel, about ſeven leagues to the leward of this, and which we had made ourſelves maſters of, though the enemy had endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ruin it by ſinking ſhips in the entrance: and we had lately ſent near one hundred tranſports with ſome men of war there, for ſecurity againſt the ſeaſon, in which we are already advanced.</p>
                                    <p>It will be as needleſs, as almoſt impoſſible, for me to expreſs or deſcribe that perfect harmony that has uninterruptedly ſubſiſted between the fleet and the army, from our firſt ſetting out. Indeed it is doing injuſtice to both, to mention them as two corps, ſince each has endeavoured, with the moſt conſtant and chearful emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to render it but one; uniting in the ſame principles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory for their King and Country's ſervice. I am glad, on this occaſion, to do juſtice to the diſtinguiſhed merit of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore Keppel, who executed the ſervice, under his direction, on the Coxmar ſide, with the greateſt ſpirit, activity and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; and I muſt repeat that the zeal of his majeſty's ſea officers and ſeamen exerted in carrying on the ſervices alloted to them, is highly to be commended.</p>
                                    <p>I ſhall now beg leave to refer their Lordſhips to capt. Harvey for all further particulars, who I ſend with this letter, and who has approved himſelf a brave and deſerving officer in this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; therefore think myſelf obliged to deſire their lordſhips will recommend him to his majeſty.</p>

                                    <p>ON the 28th of <hi>July</hi> the <hi>Intrepide</hi> arrived, with 11 ſail of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports, with troops from <hi>New York.</hi> They ſailed from thence the 11th of <hi>June.</hi> The <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> and four tranſports run on <hi>Cayo Comfite,</hi> the entrance of the Bahama Streights on the Cuba ſide, the 24th of <hi>July,</hi> an hour before day light, and were ſtranded, but loſt no ſeamen or ſoldiers. The <hi>Intrepide</hi> met the <hi>Richmond</hi> the day after, who was looking out for the convoy. Capt. <hi>Elphinſton</hi> returned with the three tranſports which were cleared, in order to bring away the ſeamen and troops who were on ſhore; and, to make all poſſible diſpatch, I ſent away the <hi>Echo, Cygnet</hi> and <hi>Thunder</hi> bomb, to meet the <hi>Richmond,</hi> and to take the men out of her; and ordered captain <hi>Elphinſton</hi> to take the <hi>Cygnet</hi> with him, and proceed up the Streights to meet the ſecond divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of tranſports.</p>
                                    <p>The 2d inſtant, the <hi>Echo</hi> and bomb returned with the ſecond diviſion, conſiſting of eleven ſail of tranſports, which ſailed from <hi>New York</hi> the 30th of <hi>June.</hi> The <hi>Richmond, Lizard, Enterprize, Cygnet,</hi> and <hi>Porcupine</hi> ſloop, arrived the 8th, bringing with them all the ſeamen and ſoldiers from the ſhips that were wrecked. Captain <hi>Banks</hi> informed me, that, on the 21ſt of <hi>July,</hi> at three o'clock in the afternoon, being near the paſſage between <hi>Maya Guanna,</hi> and the <hi>North Caicos,</hi> he diſcovered two <hi>French</hi> ſhips of the line, three frigates, and ſix ſail of brigantine and ſloops; that the men of war and frigates gave chace to the convoy; and that five of the tranſports were taken with 350 regulars of <hi>Anſtruther</hi>'s regiment, and 150 provincial troops on board of them. All the reſt of the troops arrived and landed in perfect health.</p>
                                    <p>I have thought it neceſſary to order the <hi>Sutherland</hi> and <hi>Dover</hi> to be fitted as flags of truce, taking out their lower tier of guns in order to accommodate the late <hi>Spaniſh</hi> commodore, the governor of the <hi>Havannah,</hi> the viceroy of <hi>Peru,</hi> and the governor of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena,</hi> to <hi>Old Spain,</hi> and then return to <hi>England.</hi> Tranſports are getting ready for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſoldiers and ſailors, agreeable to the capitulation, which I hope we ſhall be able to diſpatch in a few days.</p>
                                    <p>I have not been able to collect an account of the killed and wounded ſeamen belonging to the different ſhips ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſiege, who were employed at the batteries on ſhore, but it ſhall go by the firſt opportunity.</p>

                           <pb n="506" facs="tcp:1261701201:572"/>Spain now began very ſenſibly to feel the inconveniences and miſeries ſhe had voluntarily drawn on herſelf, by enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a war ſo fatal to her. No ſooner had the news of
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:1261701201:573"/>
this important capture reached Madrid, than an univerſal dejection appeared in every countenance, and the high-towering hopes they had formed at the beginning of the war
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:1261701201:574"/>
entirely vaniſhed: the prodigious advantages they had vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expected to flow from the <hi>family compact,</hi> were now ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered abortive, and grief and deſpair were the melancholy offspring of injuſtice and raſhneſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="509" facs="tcp:1261701201:575"/>Great Britain, on the contrary, as prudent in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of victory, as brave in gaining it, ſeemed not ſo elated with her good fortune, as to make her indulge in the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:1261701201:576"/>
lap of indolence, but determined by the proſecution of the war in the ſame able and vigorous manner, to compel her enemies to ſue for that peace they had, when offered, haughtily refuſed.</p>
                        <p>To effect ſo great, ſo deſirable a work, it was thought the reduction of the Philippine iſlands would not a little contribute; that enterprize was therefore formed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to the execution of two great men, who had on many occaſions before, ſignalized themſelves in the ſervice of their country, and approved themſelves equal to the greateſt things: theſe were General Draper, and Admiral Corniſh. The troops allotted for the ſervice, were the 79th regiment, and a company of the royal artillery, 30 of the artillery furniſhed by the gentlemen of Madraſs, 600 Seapoys, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:1261701201:577"/>
of Caffrees, one of Topazes, and one of Pioneers; to which were added, the precarious aſſiſtance of two compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Frenchmen, enliſted in their ſervice, with ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of unarmed Laſcars, for the uſe of the engineers, and park of artillery. This little ſupply of men was farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced with a fine battalion of 550 ſeamen, and 270 good marines; ſo that the whole force amounted to 2300 men, who, with the neceſſary ſtores, were embarked on board of his majeſty's ſquadron, and two India ſhips employed as tranſports.</p>
                        <p>As it may appear ſurprizing ſo important a conqueſt ſhould be attempted with ſo ſmall a force, when a greater might be employed, it may not be amiſs to obſerve, that if more were drawn from the coaſts the ſettlements would be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and therefore, it may be thought adviſeable, rather to attempt with a few brave men, a place that was unprepared (as imagined) for ſuch a viſit, than by employing a greater force to ſubject our own colonies to hoſtile attempts, and, perhaps, to give the enemy time to be aware of our deſigns.</p>
                        <p>On the firſt of Auguſt the forces ſet ſail, the Seahorſe, Capt. Grant, having been previouſly diſpatched through the ſtreights of Malacca, to the entrance of the China ſea, to ſtop all veſſels that might be bound to Manila, or ſent from any of the neighbouring ſettlements to give the Spaniards intelligence of the deſign. On the 23d of the following month they anchored in Manila bay, and found that their viſit was unexpected, and the enemy unprepared. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe as much as poſſible their viſible confuſion and conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it was determined to loſe no time in the attack of the port of Cavite, as at firſt determined, but proceed directly to the grand object, the city of Manila, the general and admiral rightly judging, that their conqueſt of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant place would of courſe occaſion and draw after it the fall of Cavite.</p>
                        <p>In conſequence of this reſolution, a ſummons was ſent to the governor to ſurrender the town,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sept. 24."/> 

 but it had no effect on him; wherefore the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſome other principal officers examined the coaſt, in order to fix upon a proper ſpot for landing the troops, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, and ſtores. About two miles to the ſouth of Manila a convenient place was found. Accordingly all the boats were prepared, and the frigates ſent in very near the ſhore, to cover the deſcent. Theſe latter kept up a very briſk
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:1261701201:578"/>
fire to the right and left, to protect the flanks, and diſperſe the enemy who were aſſembled in great numbers, both horſe and foot, to oppoſe a deſcent. It had the deſired effect. The Spaniards retired, and left a clear coaſt; but a violent ſurf ariſing, many boats were daſhed to pieces, the arms and ammunition much damaged, but providentially, no lives were loſt. The troops then formed upon the beach, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and took poſſeſſion of the Malatta, fixed their out-poſts, and paſſed the whole night under arms. The Spaniards in the mean time, were employed in burning of their ſuburbs. The next day a fort, named the Polveriſta, which the enemy had abandoned was ſeized,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sept. 25."/> 

 which proved a moſt excellent place of arms for covering the landing of the ſtores, and ſecuring a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the ſquadron. Colonel Monſon, who had been detached by the general with 200 men to view the roads and approaches to Manila, occupied the Hermita church, which was large and commodious, and about 900 yards from the city. Orders were then ſent to major Moore to march up with the 79th regiment, to ſecure and maintain that poſt, which was performed with great activity and good conduct. Poſſeſſion was then taken of St. Jago's church, near the ſea, it being looked on as a place of infinite impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards the carrying on their operations.</p>
                        <p>On the 26th, the admiral ſent on ſhore the battalions of ſeamen under the command of the captains Collins, of the Weymouth, Pitchford of the America, and George Ourry from the Panther. The reſt of the company's troops of all ſorts were likewiſe landed, and put under cover. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards advanced out of the garriſon, under the command of the chevalier Fayet, with 400 men, and two field pieces, and from a church about 200 yards to the right of St. Jago's church, began a cannonade upon the right flank of the troops poſted there. Some ſeapoys, under enſign Carty, were ſent to ſkirmiſh with them, ſupported by three picquets of the 79th regiment, and 100 ſeamen, all under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of colonel Monſon, who ſoon drove the enemy back into the town.</p>
                        <p>The ſuperior ſkill and bravery of the Engliſh troops were ſo evident from this affair, that it occaſioned a ſecond ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to the governor, but to no purpoſe; the anſwer was much more ſpirited than their conduct had been. The church from whence the Spaniards had been driven, colonel
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:1261701201:579"/>
Monſon had orders to keep poſſeſſion of, if he found it tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, from the top of which a perfect view was had of the enemy's works. The front they were obliged to attack, was defended by the baſtions of St. Diego and St. Andrew, with orillons and retired flanks; a ravelin which covered the royal gate, a wet ditch, covered way, and glacis, but all theſe works were out of repair, except the baſtions, which were in excellent order, and lined with a great number of fine braſs cannon. It became abſolutely neceſſary to ſound the ditch, and which might have proved a very perilous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, had the Spaniards been careful in poſting centries on the covered way, but their omiſſion and negligence made it the more eaſy. It was therefore undertaken and effected by a ſmall party of the 79th regiment under captain Fletcher, with the loſs only of three men.</p>
                        <p>The city of Manila being of great extent, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men employed to reduce it very ſmall, it became impoſſible to inveſt it on every ſide; two ſides therefore were conſtantly open to the enemy to introduce ſupplies of men and proviſions, and carry out their effects. The gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon conſiſted of 800 men of the royal regiment under the command of the marquis of Villa Mediana, brigadier gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which was farther reinforced by a body of 10,000 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. It is evident from hence, that the diſadvantages un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the Engliſh forces laboured could not be remedied, nor could there be any reaſonable ground for ſucceſs, but in the prudence and wiſdom of the general, and the matchleſs intrepidity of the troops.</p>
                        <p>The city continued thus inveſted, and was cannonaded both by the batteries erected, and the frigates, which were brought up till the 2d of October, when a battery for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four pounders was completed, and a mortar battery for the heavy ſhells of ten and twelve inches, which made a good parallel, and communication from the church to the gun battery, and eſtabliſhed a ſpacious place of arms on the left of it, near the ſea. Theſe were greatly facilitated by the roaring of the waves, it being very tempeſtuous weather, and which prevented the Spaniards from hearing the noiſe of the workmen, who gave no ſort of interruption, but ſeemed to truſt entirely to the elements. In the mean time, the governor, who was an archbiſhop, gave out, that an Angel from the Lord was gone forth to deſtroy the Engliſh, like the hoſt of Senacherib. In the afternoon the ſeamen,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:1261701201:580"/>
with great activity and indefatigable labour had brought up and mounted all the guns in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Oct. 2."/> 

 which were maſked.</p>
                        <p>A ſally was made the 4th by 1000 of the Indians, who attacked the cantonment of the ſeamen; but upon the alarm, colonel Monſon and captain Fletcher, with the picquets, being diſpatched to their aſſiſtance, the enemy was repulſed, and forced to fly, with the loſs of 300 men. Had the ſkill and weapons of theſe Indians, who are a wild and barbarous people from the province of Pampanga, been equal to their ſtrength and ferocity, the diſperſion of them might not have been ſo eaſy; for though armed chiefly with bows, arrows, and lances; they advanced up to the very muzzles of their enemy's pieces, repeated their aſſaults, and died like wild beaſts, gnawing the bayonets. In this ſkirmiſh, captain Porter, a brave and experienced ſea officer was ſlain. Scarce were the Indians thus routed, when another body of them, with part of the Spaniſh garriſon, attacked the church, and forced the ſeapoys from their poſt in it, neareſt the town, took poſſeſſion of the top, from whence they killed and wounded ſeveral of the Engliſh, who were entirely expoſed to all their weapons. Notwithſtanding their diſadvantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſituation, the European ſoldiers maintained their poſt behind the church with great patience and firmneſs, and at laſt diſlodged the enemy, with the loſs of captain Strahan, of the 79th regiment, and 40 private men wounded or killed. The Spaniards left 70 dead behind them in and about the church. This was their laſt effort. All their Indians, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting 1800, diſcouraged by the loſs, returned home, and the fire of the beſiegers continuing with unremitted fury, the next day a breach appeared practicable, and it was thought the Spaniards, ſenſible of their danger, would think of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the town: but they were obſtinate without bravery, or any generous reſolution of defending the breach.</p>
                        <p>The next day, at four in the morning, in conſequence of a reſolution formed the preceding night, the troops filed off from their quarters in ſmall bodies to give the leſs ſuſpicion to the enemy,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 6."/> 

 with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of ſtorming the town, and by degrees, aſſembled at St. Jago's church, obſerving the utmoſt ſilence, and conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in the place of arms, and parallel between the church and the battery, while in the mean time a briſk fire was kept up upon the works, and thoſe places where the
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:1261701201:581"/>
enemy might be lodged or intrenched. At day break a large body of Spaniards was diſcerned, forming themſelves on the baſtion of St. Andrew, but upon the exploſion of ſome ſhells that were thrown among them, they went off. Taking im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate advantage of this, and by the ſignal of a general diſcharge of artillery and mortars, the troops ruſhed on to the aſſault, under cover of a thick ſmoke that blew directly upon the town. Sixty volunteers of different corps under lieutenant Ruſſel of the 79th led the way, ſupported by the grenadiers of that regiment. The engineers, with the pioneers and other workmen, to clear and enlarge the breach, and make lodgments, in caſe the enemy ſhould have been too ſtrongly intrenched in the gorge of the baſtion, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Col. Monſon and major More were at the head of two grand diviſions of the 79th; the battalion of ſeamen advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed next, ſuſtained by the other two diviſions of the 79th: and the company's troops cloſed the rear. They all mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the breach with amazing ſpirit and rapidity, and diſperſed the Spaniards with the greateſt facility. Little reſiſtance was given, except at the Royal gate, and from the galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the lofty houſes which ſurrounded the grand ſquare. In the guard houſe over the Royal gate, 100 of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards and Indians who would not ſurrender, were put to the ſword; and according to the enemy's own account, 300 men were drowned in attempting to eſcape over the river, which was very deep and rapid. The governor and principal officers retired to the citadel, and were glad to ſurrender as priſoners at diſcretion, as that place was in no good poſture of defence; the marquis of Villa Mediana, and the reſt of the Spaniſh officers, were admitted as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of war on their paroles of honour, and to conciliate the affections of the natives, all the Indians taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, were diſmiſſed in ſafety.</p>
                        <p>The joy on taking this important place was greatly cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the loſs of major More, who being transfixed with an arrow near the Royal gate, died immediately, univerſally lamented for his good qualities. A few officers only were wounded, and no more than 30 private men killed or wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In conſequence of the terms given to the Spaniards, the port of Cavite, and the citadel, with the iſlands and forts dependent on Manila, were given up to his Britannic ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and they were to pay four millions of dollars for the preſervation of the town and their effects.</p>

                                    <p>I DO myſelf the honour of ſending lieut. col. <hi>Scott,</hi> late adjutant-general, to inform your Lordſhip of the ſucceſs of his Majeſty's arms in the conqueſt of <hi>Manila,</hi> the ſurrender of the port of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite,</hi> and the ceſſion of the <hi>Phillippine</hi> iſlands.</p>
                                    <p>On the 6th of <hi>October</hi> we took the capital by ſtorm, after 12 days operation, which are detailed in my journal. Our loſs upon this occaſion would have been trifling, but for the death of major <hi>More,</hi> a valiant good officer; and it is with particular ſatisfaction I can aſſure your Lordſhip, that the firm bravery and perſeverance of the troops, could only be equalled by their humanity after vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. Out of reſpect and deference to Admiral <hi>Corniſh,</hi> we waited till he came on ſhore, and being deſirous to ſave ſo fine a city from deſtruction, we jointly dictated the annexed conditions to the governor general (the Archbiſhop) and the chief magiſtrates, who moſt readily embraced them.</p>
                                    <p>Conſidering their critical ſituation, and vaſt opulence, the terms were as reaſonable for them as beneficial to us. We allow the <hi>India</hi> company a third part of the ranſom, the whole of which amounts to a million ſterling; and, according to my inſtructions, I have this day delivered up Manila, one of the richeſt cities and iſlands in this part of the world, with the port of <hi>Cavite,</hi> to <hi>Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Drake,</hi> 
                                       <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and the other gentlemen appointed to receive them on behalf of the company, with all the artillery, ammunition, and warlike ſtores found therein, agreeable to the incloſed inventories.</p>
                                    <p>I have appointed major <hi>Fell</hi> of the 79th regiment to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant of the garriſon, which muſt conſiſt of all the troops brought from Madraſs, as the great extent of the place, its very numerous inhabitants, and unſettled country, with the importance of the <hi>Cavite,</hi> demand at leaſt, this force for an effectual ſecurity.</p>
                                    <p>The ſeaſon of the year, and condition of the ſquadron, oblige us to defer the taking poſſeſſion of the ſubordinate places ceded to the crown, until the ſhips have had a ſufficient repair; and I have the pleaſure to acquaint your Lordſhip, that the large quantity of naval ſtores taken in the royal magazines at <hi>Cavite,</hi> ſupply moſt excellent materials for this purpoſe, in which the Admiral is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable, whoſe zeal for his majeſty's ſervice, great cordiality, and conſtant attention to us during the whole courſe of the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and fatiguing progreſs of the ſiege, are beyond all praiſe. The other officers of the fleet exerted themſelves to the utmoſt upon every occaſion. As a ſmall acknowledgment of our many obligations to Mr. <hi>Kempenfelt,</hi> the Admiral's captain. I begged his acceptance of the government of the citadel and port of <hi>Cavite,</hi> till it was given up to the company; his prudent and excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations there were of infinite utility to the public ſervice.</p>
                                    <p>The captains <hi>Collins, Pitchford,</hi> and <hi>George Ourry,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the battalion of ſeamen, behaved with great ſpirit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and capt. <hi>Jocelyn,</hi> who was intruſted with the care of the diſembarkations, gave us all the aſſiſtance that could be wiſhed or expected from a diligent good officer. The marine officers and corps were of great ſervice, and the ſeamen aſtoniſhed us with moſt extraordinary proofs of activity and valour, particularly thoſe who aſſiſted at our batteries.</p>
                                    <p>The reduction of <hi>Manila</hi> has been ſo much owing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate ſkill and bravery of Col. <hi>Monſon,</hi> that I fear my faint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations cannot do juſtice to his merit; and I moſt humbly beg leave, through your Lordſhip, to recommend him to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, together with the following officers, viz. Lieut. Col. <hi>Scott,</hi> Major <hi>Barker,</hi> who commanded our artillery; Capt. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> Major of Brigade; the engineers, Captains <hi>Stephenſon,</hi> and <hi>Cotsford,</hi> and Enſign <hi>Barnard;</hi> the Captains <hi>Moore</hi> and <hi>Pemble,</hi> aids-de-camp, who have all acted in their ſeveral departments with extraordinary merit, and greatly facilitated my good fortune. Both the royal and the company's artillery, with their other troops, behaved very well. In the laſt place, may I preſume to point out the ſervices of the 79th regiment, which, from the good conduct of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and preſent field-officers, has the peculiar merit of having firſt ſtopped the progreſs of the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> and not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the happineſs and deciſion of that war under Col <hi>Coote,</hi> and has ſince extended the glory of his Majeſty's arms to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt verge of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Twenty-three officers, with upwards of 800 men have fallen in the cauſe of their country, ſince the regiment left <hi>England:</hi> Numbers of the ſurvivors are wounded. Your Lordſhip's goodneſs encourages me to mention them as objects of compaſſion and protection. Captain <hi>Fletcher</hi> has nine colours to lay at his Majeſty's feet.</p>

                                    <p>IT is with the greateſt pleaſure I have the honour to acquaint their lordſhips with the ſucceſs of his majeſty's arms in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the city of <hi>Manila,</hi> which was taken by ſtorm on the morning of the 9th inſtant. In my letters of the 23d and 31ſt of <hi>July,</hi> I acquainted their lordſhips with my proceedings to that time; after which I uſed every poſſible means at <hi>Madras</hi> for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch; the decline of the S. W. monſoon making it of the utmoſt importance. To promote this end, I compleated the <hi>Elizabeth, Grafton, Lenox, Weymouth,</hi> and <hi>Argo,</hi> with ſuch of the troops and military ſtores, as they were to take on board, and on the 29th ſent them away under the command of Commodore <hi>Tiddeman,</hi> to proceed to <hi>Malacca,</hi> with a view that they might compleat their water there by the time I ſhould arrive with the remainder of the ſquadron</p>
                                    <p>Having accompliſhed the embarkation of every thing deſigned for the expedition, with a diſpatch much beyond my expectations, as we had from the whole time of my being there a violent ſurf to contend with, I ſailed the firſt of Auguſt with the ſhips undermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, viz. <hi>Norfolk, Panther, America, Seaford, South-Sea Caſtle</hi> ſtore ſhips, Admiral <hi>Steven</hi>'s ſtore-ſhip, <hi>Oſterly</hi> Company's ſhip, leaving the <hi>Falmouth,</hi> at the requeſt of the preſident and council, to convoy the <hi>Eſſex India</hi> ſhip, who was not ready to ſail, having the treaſure to take on board the China cargoes, and to bring to Manila ſuch of the company's ſervants, as were to be put in poſſeſſion of that Government, if the expedition ſucceeded.</p>
                                    <p>The 19th, I arrived at Mallacca, and was diſappointed in not finding Mr. Tiddeman there, who did not join me till the 21ſt having met with long calms: the difficulty of watering the ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron at this place made it the 27th before I could leave the road.</p>
                                    <p>On the 2d of <hi>September</hi> I arrived off <hi>Pulo Timean,</hi> and was join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by capt, <hi>Grant,</hi> in the <hi>Seahorſe,</hi> whom I had detached, upon my firſt arrival at <hi>Madraſs,</hi> to cruize between this iſland and the ſtraits of <hi>Sincapore,</hi> to ſtop any veſſels he might ſuſpect going to <hi>Manila.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>On the 19th I made the coaſt of <hi>Luconia,</hi> but was drove off again by a ſtrong N. E. wind, which ſeperated ſome of the ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron. The 22d the gale broke up, and the wind ſhifting to the S. W. the 23d we recovered the land again; the next day entered the bay of <hi>Manila,</hi> and in the cloſe of the evening anchored off the port of <hi>Cavite</hi> with the whole ſquadron, except the <hi>South-Sea Caſtle,</hi> and Admiral <hi>Stevens,</hi> the <hi>Falmouth</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi> having joined me off the coaſt. In the night I ſent the maſters to ſound about the fortifications of <hi>Cavite,</hi> and, by their report found that it might be attacked by ſhips.</p>
                                    <p>The 25th in the morning, the wind not being favourable to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the <hi>Cavite.</hi> I took two of the frigates, and with general <hi>Draper,</hi> and ſome other officers, reconnoitred the ſhore about Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nila: and obſerved ſome churches and other buildings to ſtand near the works on the ſouth ſide of the town, particularly toward the S. W. baſtion. We had ſome deſign of attacking <hi>Cavite</hi> firſt, to have had the conveniency of that port for the ſhipping, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that though the attack ſhould be attended with all the ſucceſs we could hope, yet it would cauſe a delay at leaſt of two days before we could land at Manila, which time would afford opportunity to the enemy to demoliſh thoſe buidings near the works, and to prepare many obſtacles to our landing and perhaps recover from that conſternation our unexpected arrival had thrown them in; and ſurther, Manila being the capital, if that fell, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite</hi> would in conſequence.</p>
                                    <p>From theſe conſiderations, I joined in opinion with the general to take advantage of circumſtances, ſo favourable for a deſcent, and land the troops with all diſpatch, and endeavour to get poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome poſts near their works, which, if effected, would greatly facilitate the reduction of the city.</p>
                                    <p>In conſequence of theſe reſolutions, I immediately made the ſignal on board the Seahorſe for the ſquadron to join me, and for the troops to prepare to land. About ſeven in the evening the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We had no oppoſition from the enemy; but ſome difficulty from the ſurf, which ran high, and bilged all the long boats, but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily loſt no men.</p>
                                    <p>The next morning the general took an advanced poſt about 200 yards from the glacis, and there, under cover of a blind, intended his battery againſt the face of the S. W. baſtion. The number of troops being ſmall, I landed a battalion of ſeamen, conſiſting of about 700 men, under the command of the Captains Collins, Pitchford, and George Ourry.</p>
                                    <p>The 25th I diſpatched three armed boats after a galley, coming up the bay to Manila; they came up with her, reſolutely boarded her; and took her, notwithſtanding ſhe kept up a ſmart fire with patteraroes and muſkets; ſhe mounted two carri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                    <p>The 28th of <hi>September</hi> the General acquainted me, that he was beginning to work on the battery, and that if ſome ſhips could get near enough to throw ſhot on the works of the town oppoſite to it, it might take off ſome of the enemy's fire and attention, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by facilitate its conſtruction. In conſequence of this, I ordered Commodore <hi>

                                    <p>On the 30th, the <hi>South Sea Caſtle</hi> arrived with ſtores which were much wanted, particularly the entrenching tools, for want of which the army had been ſo greatly diſtreſſed, that I was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to employ all the forges in making ſpades, pickaxes, &amp;c. for them. The firſt of <hi>October</hi> it began to blow freſh, and in the night increaſed to a hard gale, which drove the <hi>South Sea Caſtle</hi> aſhore near the <hi>Pulveriſta,</hi> a little to the ſouthward of our camp. This accident, however, had ſome conſiderable advantages attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as the ſituation ſhe lay in made her cannon a protection for the rear of our camp: it was likewiſe the means that all her mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſtores were got on board with ſafety and diſpatch, and the army ſupplied with the proviſions ſhe had on board, both of which were articles they ſtood in immediate need of, and which could not have been ſupplied by boats, as it continued blowing weather for ſeveral days after, and the ſurf breaking very high on the beach.</p>
                                    <p>This gale was from the W. S. W. directly on the ſhore, which gave me much concern for the ſafety of the ſquadron, particularly for the Elizabeth and Falmouth, who were only in four fathom wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and, as I have been ſince informed, ſtruck; but the bottom being mud, and ſoft to a conſiderable depth, they received no damage. On the 4th in the morning, the General opened the battery, which was ſo well managed, and ſeconded by the ſhips before the town that in four hours the defences were taken off, and the next day in the evening the breach was made practicable.</p>
                                    <p>On the 6th, at day light in the morning, the general's regiment, with the ſea battalion, mounted the breach, made the attack, and ſoon got poſſeſſion of all the baſtions, which completed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. I immediately went on ſhore, and with the General, had a meeting with the Spaniſh Governor, and ſome of the principal officers, when a capitulation was agreed on, that the town and port of Cavite, with the iſlands and forts dependent on Manila, ſhould be given up to his Britannick Majeſty, and that they ſhould pay four millions of dollars for the preſervation of the town and their effects, (a copy of which capitulation I have incloſed)</p>
                                    <p>On the 10th I ſent capt. <hi>Kempenfelt</hi> in the <hi>Norfolk,</hi> with the <hi>Seaford</hi> and <hi>Seahorſe,</hi> to take poſſeſſion of Cavite, agreeable to the capitulation; by this acquiſition we are in poſſeſſion of a very large quantity of naval ſtores; and beſide the advantage of almoſt every convenience for reſiſting a ſquadron, the people are ſupplied with freſh meat and vegetables in great plenty.</p>
                                    <p>The ſiege, though ſhort, was attended with many difficulties and great fatigue, in which both the officers and men exerted themſelves with the utmoſt chearfulneſs. We had conſtant freſh gales, a lee ſhore, and conſequently a high ſurf to contend with, which made it always difficult, frequently hazardous and ſometimes impoſſible to land with boats. The rains fell very heavy; and our little army were ſurrounded and harraſſed by numerous bodies of Indians, who, though undiſciplined, and armed only with lances, bows and arrows, yet by a daring reſolution and contempt of death, they became not only troubleſome but formidable. I have the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of acquainting their lordſhips, that throughout the whole expedition, the moſt perfect harmony and unanimity have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted between his majeſty's land and ſea forces.</p>
                                    <p>You will receive with this, an account of the number of officers and men, both ſeamen and marines, that were landed from the ſquadron, as likewiſe of the killed and wounded in each corps. It is with concern, I acquaint their lordſhips with the loſs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore <hi>Tiddeman,</hi> who, in attempting to enter the river in his barge, the morning after the reduction of Manila, was drowned with five of his people, by which unhappy accident, his Majeſty has loſt a brave and experienced officer.</p>
                                    <p>Captain <hi>Kempenfelt,</hi> by whom I ſend this (and will preſent to you for their lordſhips a plan of the town of Manila, and the port of <hi>Cavite</hi>) has been of the greateſt aſſiſtance to me during the courſe of this enterprize; he is very capable of furniſhing their lordſhips with many particulars neceſſary for their information; and his great merit makes it my duty to recommend him as a very able and good officer.</p>

                                    <p>IN my letter of the 31ſt of <hi>October,</hi> I acquainted you of my hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent Captain <hi>Parker</hi> with the <hi>Panther</hi> and <hi>Argo,</hi> in queſt of the galeon St. <hi>Philippina,</hi> from <hi>Acapulco,</hi> bound to Manila.</p>
                                    <p>The 7th inſtant capt. <hi>King</hi> in the <hi>Argo,</hi> returned with a letter from capt. <hi>Parker,</hi> acquainting me, that, in conſequence of my orders, having the 30th of <hi>October</hi> got the length of the iſland <hi>Capul,</hi> near the entrance into the <hi>Embocadera,</hi> in purſuit of the St. Philippina, where the <hi>Argo</hi> had come to an anchor (and which he intended to do for that night) juſt as the day cloſed ſaw a ſail, and ſtanding to the northward; at eight in the evening he got ſight of the chaſe, about two leagues to leward, but unluckily by the rapidity of a counter current, to what the chaſe was in, drove among the Narrango's in the utmoſt danger of being loſt, and obliged to anchor; the frigate having eſcaped the danger, got up with the chace, and engaged her near two hours; but was ſo roughly handled, that capt. King was obliged to bring too to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair his damages. By this time the current ſlackened, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled capt. Parker to get under ſail with the chace in ſight: about nine the next morning he came up with her, and after bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering her two hours within half muſket ſhot, ſhe ſtruck. The enemy made but little reſiſtance, truſting to the immenſe thickneſs of the ſides of their ſhip, which the Panther's ſhot was not able to penetrate, except her upper works. Capt. Parker was no leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed than ſurprized, when the general came on board, to find, that inſtead of the Saint Philippina, he had engaged and taken the Santiſſimo Trinadad, who departed from Manila the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> for <hi>Acapulco,</hi> and had got three hundred leagues to the eaſtward of the <hi>Embocadero;</hi> but meeting with a hard gale of wind, was diſmaſted and put back to refit. She had eight hundred men on board, and pierced for ſixty guns, but when Capt. <hi>King</hi> engaged her, had only ſix mounted, and but thirteen when taken: ſhe draws thirty-three feet water, and is a much larger ſhip than the <hi>Panther.</hi> I cannot aſcertain the value of the cargo, but there is to the amount of one million and a half of dollars regiſtered, and ſhe is reputed ſo be worth three millions.</p>
                                    <p>Capt. King left the <hi>Panther</hi> with her prize at anchor about three leagues ſouth of the <hi>Corrigedow,</hi> at the mouth of this bay; and as I have ſent a reinforcement of men with launches and warps, I hope very ſoon to have her in ſafety.</p>

and that of the Santiſſimo Trinidad, a Manila ſhip, muſt be added to theſe reſources.

ſunk thoſe reſources of money, which were the principal objects to France, when ſhe formed that famous treaty.

                        </argument>
                        <p>WHEN France had found experimentally, that the preſent at leaſt was not the favourable time for drawing from her alliance all thoſe advantages with which ſhe flattered herſelf, ſhe inclined in good earneſt to peace, The ſincerity of her procedure in the former negotiation might be juſtly queſtioned; becauſe ſhe had prepared an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter game in caſe of its breaking off. And ſhe ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied on it, that it is very poſſible the negotiation itſelf was but a feint made to cover and to prepare that project. But finding that Great Britain was neither intimidated by the threats of that formidable alliance, nor at all likely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the exertion of its forces; ſhe came in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt into theſe pacific ſentiments, which formerly ſhe had only counterfeited. The ſlow progreſs of the Bourbon troops in Portugal, the retrograde motion of the French army in
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:1261701201:593"/>
Germany, the taking of Martinico and its dependencies, and the imminent danger in which they beheld the Havan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, all conſpired to humble the pride, and daſh the hopes of the Bourbon alliance.</p>
                        <p>On the ſide of Great Britain likewiſe, the diſpoſitions to peace became much more cordial. No people were ever leſs intoxicated with their ſucceſſes. Victories were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come familiar to us, and made but little impreſſion. The marks of public joy on the moſt conſiderable conqueſts, were become much ſlighter and colder, than were ſhewed at the beginning of the war, upon very trivial advantages. Beſides the nation had occaſion for peace. Though her trade had been greatly augmented, a circumſtance without example favourable, and though many of her conqueſts, as we have ſeen, were very far from unlucrative, her ſupplies of money, great as they were, did not keep pace with her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences. The ſupply of men too, which was neceſſary to furniſh the waſte of ſo extenſive a war, became ſenſibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, and the troops were not recruited but with ſome difficulty, and at a heavy charge. It was time to cloſe the war, when every end, we could rationally propoſe to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in carrying it on, was anſwered; we had enough in our hands to anſwer all our demands, and almoſt all our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations; and as it is grown into a ſort of maxim, that nations greatly victorious, muſt cede ſomething on a peace, the difficulty on our ſide was only what, and how much we ſhould retain. Not that there was a doubt, but whatever choice of acquiſition could be made upon any rational prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, a great deal would ſtill remain to give the fulleſt ſcope to every ſentiment of equity and moderation,</p>
                        <p>All theſe were ſufficient inducements to peace. But other things operated as cauſes. An alteration in the ſyſtem of the Britiſh miniſtry had begun this war; another alteration put an end to it.</p>
                        <p>The whole council had been almoſt unanimous to oppoſe Mr. Pitt, in his ſcheme for precipitating the declaration of war againſt Spain. They thought his principles too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and they did not perfectly like his perſon. When he retired from publick buſineſs, it ſeemed as if they breathed more freely, and had got rid of a burthen that oppreſſed them. But he was not long removed, when it appeared that the remaining part of the ſyſtem, was framed upon principles ſo very diſcordant in themſelves, that it was by no means likely to ſtand.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="526" facs="tcp:1261701201:594"/>The duke of Newcaſtle, firſt lord of the treaſury, by his early zeal in favour of the proteſtant ſucceſſion, by the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and politic uſe he had made of a great fortune, by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations which in a courſe of many years, and in a ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of great employments, he was enabled to confer on ſome of the moſt conſiderable people in the kingdom, had attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great number to his fortunes, and formed an intereſt in the parliament and the nation, which it was extremely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to overturn, or even to ſhake. He came to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the head of the whigs; and he was in reality well qualified in many reſpects for the chief of a party, from his unbounded liberality, from his affability, magnificence, and perſonal diſintereſtedneſs. Even the defects and faults, which might have appeared in his character, were rather of ſervice to him, as they often tended to ſoften reſentments, and helped to give that great power, of which he was poſſeſſed, an appearance leſs formidable.</p>
                        <p>During a great part of the late king's reign, his family had directed all things without controul. On the acceſſion of his preſent majeſty, his ſituation ſeemed more doubtful. But in a little time he appeared outwardly as well eſtabliſhed as ever, not only in his former high employments, but in that ſhare of influence which is commonly ſuppoſed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it. There was, however, very little reality in this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious appearance; for he did not poſſeſs the royal confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, upon which all the eſſential of power depends. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his age, nor his ſituation in the former reign, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him the opportunity of cultivating an intereſt with the preſent king. Another noble perſon 

<note n="(a)" place="bottom">The Earl of Bute.</note>

 had been in an employment near his perſon; and having formed his mind with much attention and ſucceſs to thoſe virtues which adorn his ſtation, deſerved and obtained a very uncommon ſhare of his confidence.</p>
                        <p>This nobleman was firſt groom of the ſtole: afterwards, taking a more open ſhare in the conduct of affairs, he accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſeals as ſecretary of ſtate. On the removal of Mr. Pitt, who preſerved a ſort of union in the adminiſtration by their common dread of him, the only competition was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the duke of Newcaſtle and lord Bute. The former could not well endure that decay of influence, which, on a thouſand occaſions, he muſt have ſenſibly felt, and which
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:1261701201:595"/>
the great rank he held muſt have rendered only more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Lord Bute, on the other hand, could not bear to ſee the treaſury board, which, under whatever limitations, was attended with ſo much power, in the hands of his rival. It is indeed a department, the entire conduct of which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely eſſential to the perſon who has any pretenſions to be at the head of the Britiſh adminiſtration.</p>
                        <p>Theſe principles ſoon produced their natural effect. In a ſhort time the duke of Newcaſtle thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to reſign,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="May 26."/> 

 and lord Bute became firſt commiſſioner of the treaſury. This reſignation was followed by that of others of great conſideration for their rank and influence. No one was ſurpriſed at the ferment which enſued; in which perſonal reſentment, party violence, and national, or rather local prejudices, were all united, to throw every thing into confuſion.</p>
                        <p>In this condition of parties, a number of thoſe called Whigs, who had loſt their places, being highly irritated at the late changes, and even many of thoſe who ſtill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in employments, being ſuppoſed attached to the intereſt of the duke of Newcaſtle, and therefore not to be depended on by the new adminiſtration, it became neceſſary to have recourſe to thoſe called Tories, or country gentlemen.</p>
                        <p>From the beginning of this reign it had been profeſſed, with the general applauſe of all good men, to aboliſh thoſe odious party diſtinctions, and to extend the royal favour and protection equally to all his majeſty's ſubjects. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons called Tories had, beſides, been before active in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of ſome of thoſe, who now clamoured at the very mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which they had themſelves, more than once, adopted. However, occaſion was taken from thence to endeavour at the revival of this almoſt exploded diſtinction. There were great heats, which were blown into a combuſtion by every art, and every inſtrument of party, that had ever proved effectual upon ſimilar occaſions.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt the nation was thus diſtracted, the conduct of a war became difficult; its continuance unſafe; and its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies uncertain. If the adminiſtration failed, their failure would be conſtrued into incapacity; if they ſucceeded, their ſucceſs would be converted into an argument for ſuch terms of peace, as it would be impoſſible for them to procure. Above all, the antient and known connection between the chiefs of the moneyed intereſt and the principal perſons in
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:1261701201:596"/>
the oppoſition, muſt have been a ſubject of great anxiety to the adminiſtration.</p>
                        <p>Theſe cauſes co-operated to render the intentions of the Britiſh miniſtry towards peace altogether cordial and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere; and they thought themſelves abundantly juſtified in their wiſhes for it at this juncture, both from the ſucceſſes and the burthens of the nation; from the flouriſhing ſtate of ſome of their allies, and the doubtful ſtate of others; and in general, from thoſe arguments of humanity, which made it high time that Europe ſhould enjoy ſome interval of repoſe.</p>
                        <p>Both courts thus concurring in the ſame point, all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties were ſpeedily ſmoothed. It is ſaid, that the firſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were made under the mediation of his Sardinian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. As ſoon as terms were propoſed, in order to give a pledge to each other of their mutual ſincerity, it was agreed that this treaty ſhould not be negotiated, as the former had been, by ſubordinate perſons; but that the two courts ſhould reciprocally ſend to London and Verſailles a perſon of the firſt conſequence and diſtinction in either kingdom. Accordingly the duke of Bedford was ſent to negotiate on the part of England, and the duke de Nivernois on that of France; the great outlines of the treaty were very ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and adjuſted. The detail of ſome articles took up more time.</p>
                        <p>During this mixed interval of war and treaty, the French obtained a temporary advantage; but which neither ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended nor influenced the negotiation. It was the laſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive effort, which they made; and though this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize was attended with a temporary ſucceſs in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was in the deſign not ſuperior to any of thoſe that had failed. Monſieur de Ternay, with a ſquadron of four men of war and a bomb ketch, and M. d' Hauſonville, with a proportionable number of land forces, arrived the 24th of June at the bay of Bulls in Newfoundland, and finding the iſland little prepared to reſiſt them, took without difficulty, the forts of St. John, Trinity; and Carbonear, deſtroyed the two laſt, and likewiſe the ſtages and implements of the fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, to a conſiderable value. The immenſe extent of our military operations, rendered it little wonderful or blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that this particular part was found weak.</p>
                        <p>The French preſumed by far too much on the ſupine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the nation, when they hoped ſuch an advantage
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:1261701201:597"/>
could have any great effect on the negotiation. In fact, as ſoon as the news arrived in England, a force was fitted out to retake thoſe places. But ſuch was the vigilance and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of general Amherſt; our commander in America, that it ſuperſeded the neceſſity of this armament. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached colonel Amherſt with a body of forces, and Lord Colville with a ſmall, but ſufficient ſquadron, to recover this valuable iſland. The land forces attacked ſome detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the French, advantageouſly poſted in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of St. John's, and prepared to attack St. John's itſelf, with ſo much vigour and activity, that M. d'Hauſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, who had remained there as governor, thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to deliver up that place, and ſurrendered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and garriſon priſoners of war

                                    <p>I had the good fortune to join Lord <hi>Colville</hi>'s fleet on the 11th, a few leagues to the ſouthward of St. <hi>John</hi>'s; and by the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence his Lordſhip had received, I was obliged to change my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of landing the troops at <hi>Kitty Vitty,</hi> a narrow entrance, cloſe to the harbour of St. <hi>John</hi>'s, the enemy having entirely ſtopped up the paſſage, by ſinking ſhallops in the channel.</p>
                                    <p>From the beſt information I could get, it appeared that <hi>Torbay,</hi> about three leagues to the northward of St. <hi>John</hi>'s, was the place to land the troops at, within that diſtrict.</p>
                                    <p>Lord <hi>Colville</hi> ſent the <hi>Syren</hi> man of war into <hi>Torbay</hi> with the tranſports; and it was late at night on the 12th, before they all came to an anchor. Capt. <hi>Douglas</hi> of his Majeſty's ſhip <hi>Syren,</hi> went with me to view the Bay, and we found a very good Beach to land on. It blew hard in the night, and one of the tranſports, with the Provincial Light Infantry corps on board, was driven out to ſea.</p>
                                    <p>I landed the troops early the next morning, at the bottom of the Bay, from whence a path led to St. <hi>John</hi>'s; a party of the enemy fired ſome ſhots at the boats as they rowed in. The Light Infantry of the Regulars landed firſt, gave the enemy one fire, and drove them towards St. <hi>John</hi>'s. The battalions landed, and we marched on. The path for four miles very narrow, through a thick wood, and over very bad ground.</p>
                                    <p>Capt. <hi>M'Donnell</hi>'s Light Infantry corps in front came up with ſome of the party we drove from the Landing Place: They had concealed themſelves in the wood, fired upon us, and wounded three men. A part of <hi>M'Donnell</hi>'s corps ruſhed in upon them, took three priſoners, and drove the reſt off.</p>
                                    <p>The country opened afterwards, and we marched to the left of <hi>Kitty Vitty:</hi> It was neceſſary to take poſſeſſion of this paſs, to open a communication for the landing of artillery and ſtores, it being impracticable to get them up the way we came.</p>
                                    <p>As ſoon as our right was cloſe to <hi>Kitty Vitty</hi> river, the enemy fired upon us from a hill on the oppoſite ſide. I ſent a party up a rock, which commanded the paſſage over, and under cover of their fire, the Light Infantry companies of the Royal and <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery</hi>'s, ſupported by the grenadiers of the Royal, paſſed, drove the enemy up the hill, and purſued them on that ſide towards St. <hi>John</hi>'s: when I perceived a body of the enemy coming to their ſupport, I immediately ordered over Major <hi>Sutherland,</hi> with the remainder of the firſt battalion, upon which they thought proper to retreat; and we had juſt time, before dark, to take poſt.</p>
                                    <p>Capt. <hi>Mackenzie,</hi> who commanded <hi>Montgomery</hi>'s Light Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, was dangerouſly wounded. We took ten priſoners; the troops lay this night on their arms.</p>
                                    <p>The next morning, the 14th, we opened the channel, where the enemy had ſunk the ſhallops: they had a breaſt-work which commanded the entrance, and a battery not quite finiſhed.</p>
                                    <p>Lieut. Col. <hi>Tullikin,</hi> who had met with an accident by a fall, and was left on board, joined me this day; and Capt. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> commanding the artillery, brought round ſome light artillery and ſtores from <hi>Torbay</hi> in the ſhallops.</p>
                                    <p>The enemy had poſſeſſion of two very high and ſteep hills, one in the front of our advanced poſts, and the other nearer to St. <hi>John</hi>'s, which two hills appeared to command the whole ground from <hi>Kitty Vitty</hi> to St. <hi>John</hi>'s. It was neceſſary that we ſhould proceed on this ſide, to ſecure effectually the landing at the <hi>Kitty Vitty,</hi> from the firſt hill the enemy fired upon our poſts.</p>
                                    <p>On the 15th, juſt before day-break, I ordered Capt. <hi>M'Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell</hi>'s corps of Light Infantry, and the Provincial Light Infantry, ſupported by our advanced poſts, to march to ſurpriſe the enemy on this hill. Capt. <hi>M'Donnell</hi> paſſed their centries and advanced guards, and was firſt diſcovered by their main body on the hill, as he came climbing up the rocks near the ſummit, which he gained, receiving the enemy's fire. He threw in his fire, and the enemy gave way.</p>
                                    <p>Capt. M'Donnell was wounded; Lieut. Schuyler of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany killed, with three or four men, and eighteen wounded.</p>
                                    <p>The enemy had three companies of grenadiers and two picquets at this poſt, commanded by Lieut. Col. Belcombe, ſecond in command, who was wounded; a Captain of Grenadiers wounded and taken priſoner; his Lieut. killed, ſeveral men killed and wounded, and 13 taken priſoners.</p>
                                    <p>The enemy had one mortar here, with which they threw ſome ſhells at us in the night: a ſix-pounder not mounted, and two wall pieces.</p>
                                    <p>This hill, with one adjoining, commands the harbour,</p>
                                    <p>The 16th, we advanced to the hill nearer St. <hi>John</hi>'s, which the enemy had quitted. Twenty-nine ſhallops came in to day with artillery and ſtores, proviſion and camp equipage from Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay, which we unloaded. I moved the remainder of the troops forward, leaving a poſt to guard the paſs of <hi>Kitty Vitty,</hi> on the other ſide. Laſt night the enemy's fleet got out of the harbour. This night we lay on our arms.</p>
                                    <p>The 17th, a mortar battery was compleated, and a battery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun for four 24-pounders, and two 12-pounders, about 500 yards from the fort, made the road from the landing for the artillery, and at night opened the mortar battery, with one eight inch mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and ſeven cohorns, and ſix royals. The enemy fired pretty briſkly from the fort and threw ſome ſhells.</p>
                                    <p>The 18th, in the morning, I received a letter from Count <hi>de Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                    <p>As Lord <hi>Colville,</hi> at this time, was ſome diſtance off the coaſt, and the wind not permitting his Lordſhip to ſtand in, to honour me with his concurrence in the terms to be given to the garriſon, I thought no time ſhould be loſt in ſo advanced a ſeaſon, and therefore took upon me to determine it, hoping to meet with his Lordſhip's approbation; and he has given me the greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by entirely approving of everything I have done.</p>

                                    <p>I Had the honour of ſending you an account of my proceedings until the 18th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> by a veſſel which ſailed from <hi>Placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> for <hi>England</hi> at that time; and on the 22d I ſailed with his majeſty's ſhips the <hi>Northumberland, Antelope, Goſport</hi> and <hi>Syren,</hi> and the <hi>King George,</hi> belonging to the province of <hi>Maſſachuſett</hi>'s Bay. On the 25th, we chaſed a ſchooner off St. <hi>John</hi>'s and took her cloſe to the harbour's mouth. She had been an <hi>Engliſh</hi> priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer, taken by the enemy, had eight carriage guns mounted, and was manned with thirty <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> commanded by an enſign <hi>de Vaiſſeau.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The enemy had ſent away great part of the inhabitants of St. <hi>John</hi>'s, men, women, and children, by giving them veſſels and proviſions to carry them where they pleaſed; two of theſe, a ſloop and a ſchooner, we met with on the coaſt, and took twenty-three <hi>Iriſhmen</hi> that were ſingle men out of them, to replace in part the marines of the ſquadron that were left in garriſon at <hi>Placentia</hi> and the iſle of <hi>Boys.</hi> Theſe <hi>Iriſhmen</hi> ſaid, that if I would go into the bay of <hi>Bulls,</hi> numbers of their countrymen would reſort to me and enter on board the ſquadron; but during two days which I ſtayed in that bay, not a man joined me. The few inhabitants that remained there, quietly followed their buſineſs of fiſhing, and 'tis poſſible the enemy prevented any others at St. <hi>John</hi>'s from coming.</p>
                                    <p>Mr. <hi>Garland</hi> and Mr. <hi>Davis,</hi> two of the principal inhabitants of <hi>Harbour Grace</hi> and <hi>Carbonera,</hi> in <hi>Conception Bay</hi> having acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me that a number of men in their neighbourhood were willing to ſerve in the ſquadron during the preſent exigency, I ſent the armed ſchooner for them, and ſhe returned with fifty men, which I have diſtributed among the ſhips. And the ſame gentlemen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting, that the enemy ſometimes ſends ſmall parties by land to <hi>Portugal Cove,</hi> which have threatened to moleſt them in ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops from that place, deſired, in behalf of themſelves and all their neighbours, that the ſchooner might be ſtationed in <hi>Conception Bay.</hi> for their protection and defence, which requeſt I complied with.</p>
                                    <p>The iſland of Carbonera, in Conception Bay, has had no other garriſon for many years but a few old men of the artillery, to take care of the guns and ordnance ſtores. Had ſome of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the adjacent coaſt taken poſt here, they might eaſily have defended it againſt any force, except one narrow landing place, and no ſafe road in the neighbourhood for great ſhips; but the enemy landed in boats, and deſtroyed the whole without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. And the iſle of <hi>Boys,</hi> near <hi>Ferryland,</hi> would probably have ſhared the ſame fate, had it not been poſſeſſed in due time by the <hi>Syren</hi>'s marines.</p>
                                    <p>In frequently paſſing the harbour's mouth of St. <hi>John</hi>'s, we could plainly ſee that the fort, which fronts the entrance, was fortifyed all round the new works; and that a redoubt, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like one, was raiſed at the little harbour of <hi>Kitty Vitty.</hi> The old battery at the South-ſide of the harbour's mouth was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired with additional works, and a new one erected on the ſame ſide nearer the entrance. All theſe were to be ſeen from the ſea; and I could not learn that the enemy intended any thing more than the finiſhing theſe works.</p>
                                    <p>On the 8th of <hi>September</hi> I received by a ſloop expreſs from <hi>Halifax,</hi> letters from Sir <hi>Jeffery Amherſt</hi> at <hi>New York,</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, that he had come to a reſolution to ſend a body of troops, in order to diſlodge the enemy as ſoon as poſſible from St. <hi>John</hi>'s; and that Lieut, Col. <hi>Amherſt</hi> was to command theſe troops. The ſame conveyance brought me letters from Col. <hi>Amherſt,</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with his arrival at Halifax on the 26th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> his departure from thence on the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> and with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to call at <hi>Louisbourg</hi> for the troops there, and then proceed round Cape Race, to join me on this coaſt. Upon receipt of theſe letters, I ſent the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                          <desc>•</desc>
                                       </gap>oop which brought them to look out for Col. <hi>Amherſt</hi> and the tranſports off <hi>Cape Race;</hi> and in order to join them the ſooner, to concert meaſures for the enſuing operations, before the enemy could have notice of their arrival, I dropped down with the ſquadron to <hi>Cape Broyle,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Gili,</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi>'s who had been ſent out of the town in a cartel ſchooner two days before, ſending off advice from <hi>Ferryland,</hi> that he was ſure the enemy intended to ſail in a very little time, I returned with the ſquadron to our ſtation off St. <hi>John</hi>'s.</p>
                                    <p>On the 11th we were joined by Col. <hi>Amherſt,</hi> with the troops in ten tranſport veſſels; and I propoſed <hi>Torbay</hi> as the propereſt place to land at: It is to the northward of St. <hi>John</hi>'s, about ſeven miles by land, and the roads pretty good, but the bay is not reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned ſafe anchorage, being open to the eaſterly winds, which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally begin to prevail at this ſeaſon. By one of the tranſports from <hi>New York,</hi> I received a duplicate, the original not yet come to hand, of their Lordſhip's order of the 7th of <hi>June,</hi> directing me to repair myſelf, or ſend a ſufficient force to enable Capt. <hi>Graves</hi> of the <hi>Antelope,</hi> to defeat the deſigns of the ſquadron commanded by M. <hi>de Ternay.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>On the 12th we proceeded to Torbay. I ſent capt. Douglas in the <hi>Syren</hi> to anchor with the tranſports, accompanied by the boats of the ſquadron, and a number of ſhallops, or fiſhing boats, which I had collected from different parts for the king's ſervice. With the reſt of the ſhips I returned to my ſtation cloſe to St. <hi>John</hi>'s harbour. Next morning Col. <hi>Amherſt</hi> landed with the troops in the head of the bay, having only four men wounded from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant buſh-firing of the enemy. He marched directly to <hi>Kitty Vitty,</hi> and made himſelf maſter of that important poſt in the evening, without having a man killed, and only two or three wounded. Every thing belonging to the army was carried from Torbay to <hi>Kitty Vitty</hi> in ſhallops, eſcorted by boats from the ſquadron. And this ſervice was conducted with diligence and care, by Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> my firſt Lieutennant, Capt. <hi>Douglas</hi> having joined the ſquadron again. The enemy's fleet was to have ſailed the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I paſſed the harbour with the tranſports; and 300 men only were to be left in St. <hi>John</hi>'s for the winter; but, upon ſeeing us, they landed their grenadiers again.</p>
                                    <p>The 15th it blew ſtrong from E. to E. S. E. with thick rainy weather. In the evening the wind ſhifted to the weſtward, light breezes, and thick fog. At ſix next morning, it being calm, with a great ſwell, we ſaw from the maſt-head, but could bring them down no lower than half way the topmaſt ſhrouds, four ſail, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing S. S. E. diſtant ſeven Ieagues; the mouth of St. <hi>John</hi>'s har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at the ſame time bore W. four leagues. We loſt ſight of them about ſeven, though very clear; and ſome time after, a ſmall breeze ſpringing up in the S. W. quarter, I ſtood in towards <hi>Torbay,</hi> in order to cover the ſhallops that might by going from thence to <hi>Kitty Vitty.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>In the afternoon I received a note from Col. <hi>Amherſt,</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me that the <hi>French</hi> fleet got out laſt night. Thus, after being blocked up in St. <hi>John</hi>'s harbour for three weeks by a ſquadron of equal number, but ſmaller ſhips, with fewer guns and men, did M. <hi>Ternay</hi> make his eſcape in the night by a ſhameful flight. I beg leave to obſerve, that not a man in the ſquadron imagined the four ſail, when we ſaw them, where the enemy; and the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots were of opinion, that they muſt have had the wind much ſtronger than with us, to overcome the weſterly ſwell in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's mouth. I ſent the <hi>King George</hi> round <hi>Cape Race,</hi> as far as <hi>Trepaſſy,</hi> to bring me intelligence if the enemy ſhould ſteer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Placentia;</hi> and I directed Capt. <hi>Douglas</hi> of the <hi>Syren</hi> to get the tranſports moved from <hi>Torbay</hi> as a very unſafe road to the bay of <hi>Bulls.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>A bomb battery was opened againſt the fort, in the night of the 17th, and next day it capitulated, before any other battery began to play.</p>
                                    <p>The ſquadron got into the harbour yeſterday morning; and in the evening I received their Lordſhips order of the 3d of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> ſent me by capt. <hi>Palliſer</hi> of the <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> who, with the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbe, Bedford,</hi> and <hi>Minerva,</hi> had juſt arrived on the coaſt. I have directed capt. <hi>Palliſer,</hi> with the other ſhips, to come into the harbour, as ſoon as a convenient opportunity offers for ſo doing.</p>
                                    <p>We have about eight hundred priſoners, grenadiers, picquets, and ſome marines, being a very fine body of men, and nearly equal in number to the regulars of our army. I am now preparing tranſports to carry them to <hi>Breſt.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The enemy did not intend to leave ſo great a part of their force here; their grenadiers were ready for embarking, but M. <hi>de Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay</hi> ſeemed determined at all events to graſp an opportunity, which, if once loſt, might never be regained; therefore, in the utmoſt confuſion, he left behind his grenadiers, anchors, and turned his boats a drift when they had towed him out. The fog was ſo thick that Lieut. Col. Tullikin, who was poſted on an eminence in the narroweſt part of the harbour's mouth, could hear their noiſe, but could not diſcern any of their ſhips. The fog even altered the direction of the ſound, which ſeemed to come from another part of the harbour, whilſt they muſt have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly under him.</p>
                                    <p>There is a conſiderable quantity of proviſions and other goods at this place, collected and tumbled promiſcuouſly into different ſtorehouſes by the enemy. Many of the Iriſh ſervants have alſo been robbing and plundering their maſters. To aſcertain proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in order to make reſtitution as far as can be, and to reſtore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity to a country, ſo long diſtracted by being in the enemy's poſſeſſion, will be the particular care of governor Graves, who, in my opinion, is well qualified for ſuch an office; and as he will ſtay here, he will be able, in a great meaſure, to reſtore the affairs of this country.</p>
                                    <p>Capt. <hi>Douglas</hi> of the <hi>Syren</hi> has behaved with ſpirit and activity, and exerted every talent of a good officer during this expedition; and (without adding any more officers to the corps) I am happy in the opportunity of ſending him to wait on their lordſhips.</p>

lord Colville could arrive from the place where the troops had been landed, to co-operate with them. M. de Ternay eſcaped with the fleet, partly by having gained a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:1261701201:599"/>
diſtance, before they were diſcovered, by means of a thick fog; and partly becauſe lord Colville, after their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been diſcovered, did not apprehend that they really were the enemy's ſhips.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="532" facs="tcp:1261701201:600"/>It was in Germany that the greateſt efforts were made. Even after the negotiations had been conſiderably advanced, the military operations were in that country no way ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened.

The body under the marſhal d'Eſtrees and Soubiſe, being ſtreightened, in the manner we have ſeen, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable judgment of prince Ferdinand's meaſures, had
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:1261701201:602"/>
been obliged to call that under the prince of Conde from the Lower Rhine to their aſſiſtance. In order to complete their junction with this corps, the grand army uncovered
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:1261701201:603"/>
Caſſel, quitted the banks of the Fulda, and fell back to a conſiderable diſtance. The hereditary prince of Brunſwick, who had attended this corps all along, thought at length a
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:1261701201:606"/>
fair opportunity had occurred of ſtriking a deciſive blow againſt it.

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 30."/> 

 With this aid he attacked, with his uſual vivacity, that part of the French army,
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:1261701201:605"/>
which was poſted at a place called the heights of Johan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſberg, near the banks of the Wetter. At firſt his ſucceſs was anſwerable to his own expectations, and the courage

                           <pb n="538" facs="tcp:1261701201:608"/>
of his troops. He drove the enemy intirely from the high grounds into the plain; but whilſt he purſued his advantage, the body he attacked was reinforced by the main army. The action which began ſo favourable for the allies, ended in a defeat. They loſt above three thouſand men in killed, wounded, and priſoners. The hereditary prince, who had, through the whole action, made the moſt powerful efforts, and expoſed himſelf to the greateſt dangers, received a wound from a muſket-ball in his hip-bone, from which his life was a long time doubtful, and his recovery lingering and tedious. Whilſt his life continued in danger, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern was unuſual, and common to both armies; both taking an intereſt in the preſervation of a prince, as much endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his humanity, as admired for his valour and military genuis.</p>
                        <p>A victory of the greateſt importance could not have more fully diſplayed the ſuperiority of prince Ferdinand's capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the conduct of a war, than his meaſures after this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat. The French were not ſuffered to derive the ſmalleſt
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:1261701201:609"/>
advantage from their victory; nor did the allies loſe a foot of ground. The communication with Caſſel was ſtill at the mercy of the allies. The French, in their retreat, had thrown a garriſon of ten thouſand men in that place; and the prince made immediate and vigorous preparations to beſiege it.</p>
                        <p>When the prince had adjuſted his army to cover the ſiege the French took advantage of his movement for that purpoſe, to repaſs the Lahan near Gieſſen, and advanced towards Marpurg. But as they advanced, the prince drew his army from the ſiege, and made ſuch diſpoſitions as ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him to fall at once upon their flank and rear, drove them from all their poſts,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sept. 26."/> 

 and obliged them once more to fly with precipitation behind the Lahne.</p>
                        <p>After this ſucceſsful affair, the body of the army reſumed their preparations for the ſiege of Caſſel, which was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the grand object of the campaign; and the great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the endeavours of both armies was, of the one to open the communication with Caſſel, of the other to cut it off.</p>
                        <p>A number of ſkirmiſhes happened in theſe movements. The moſt remarkable among them was the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of Bucker Muhl,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sept. 30."/> 

 not ſo much for the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, which were not extraordinary, but for the uncommon ſteadineſs of the two parties engaged. It was a poſt of ſome moment, the forcing of which would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate to the French the reduction of Amonebourg, a ſmall fortreſs, but of importance, as it commanded a paſs which led into the country which they propoſed to enter. This poſt was nothing more than a bridge over the Ohme, defended by a ſlight redoubt on one ſide, and by a mill on the other. The allies had no cover, except the redoubt; nor the French, except the mill. The engagement began at firſt between two ſmall bodies, and an artillery proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably ſmall; but as the action warmed, the artillery was gradually augmented, until it amounted to about five and twenty heavy cannon on each ſide. The allies had originally but one hundred men in this poſt; but before the buſineſs ended, ſeventeen complete battalions were engaged, who ſucceſſively relieved each other, after each detachment had made ſixty diſcharges. The artillery fired at a diſtance of three hundred paces, and the muſquetry at thirty. Beſides,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:1261701201:610"/>
the allied troops, as they paſſed to and from the redoubt, were, for a length of four hundred paces, expoſed to all the enemy's cannon loaded with grape ſhot.</p>
                        <p>The ſituation of the French was nearly the ſame. A dreadful fire was ſupported between theſe reſolute bodies, without a moments intermiſſion, or the leaſt ſlackening on one ſide or the other, for near fifteen hours, from the dawn of day to dark night. Neither ſide gave way; and this moſt bloody conteſt for a moſt trifling object in the end left the allies in the poſſeſſion of their redoubt, and the French of their mill. The whole compaſs of military hiſtory furniſhes no inſtance of ſo obſtinate a diſpute. The allies loſt ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men in killed and wounded; towards the cloſe of the day, the dead bodies ſerved to raiſe a parapet for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt, in the place of that which had been beat to pieces by the cannonade.</p>
                        <p>The French are thought to have ſuffered more in this action than the allies. However, though they did not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their attack upon the bridge, they battered at the ſame time the caſtle of Amonebourg with ſo much fury, that in a ſhort time they effected a breach, and obliged the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to ſurrender. By this advantage they gained a good deal of ground, and even got on the rear of the allied army. But with this advantage, conſiderable as it was, they were able to do nothing deciſive: they were able neither to raiſe, nor materially to diſturb the ſiege of Caſſel, which went on without interruption; nor where they able to throw the leaſt relief into this place, where their garriſon already began to ſuffer for want of proviſions.</p>
                        <p>This capital of an unfortunate principality, which has ſo often been taken and retaken during the courſe of this war, diſpairing of relief, at length ſurrendered to the victorious arms of the allies,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Nov. 1."/> 

 after a ſiege of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days open trenches. The garriſon made an honourable capitulation. And now prince Ferdinand might conſider himſelf as maſter of Heſſe, no place of ſtrength in that country remaining in the enemy's hands, except Zie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genhayn. Advanced as the ſeaſon was, the prince prepared to lay ſiege to that fortreſs; and as he was now able to draw down his whole army into that quarter, there was no queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but he would have made himſelf maſter of the place
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:1261701201:611"/>
without any difficulty. But the ſigning of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminaries of peace,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Nov. 15."/> 

 at this time notified in the two armies, put an happy concluſion to all milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry operations.</p>
                        <p>Theſe preliminaries had very little to do towards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleting the relief of our allies; except that they ſet the ſeal on their good fortune, and prevented their being expoſed any longer to the chances of war. This campaign, though it was not diſtinguiſhed by any great deciſive victory, was not the leſs honourable to the commander or the troops. A connected ſeries of judicious and ſpirited operations produced all the effects which could be propoſed from a ſingle and brilliant ſtroke. At this period, the French, after having for ſix years exerted almoſt the whole undivided ſtrength of their monarchy upon this ſingle object, were, in the end, very little more advanced than they were the day they firſt ſet their foot in Germany. The poſſeſſion of three or four poor unimportant places was all they had purchaſed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny millions of treaſure expended, and poſſibly near two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand lives thrown away.</p>
                        <p>The whole body of the allies acquired great and juſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in this war; but the Engliſh had all along the poſt of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and obtained the higheſt reputation. As to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander the duke of Brunſwick, having begun his operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons almoſt without an army, having continued the war with an army always inferior in numbers, having experienced every variety of fortune, his capacity and his firmneſs carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with credit through all; and enabled him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the war with a triumphant ſuperiority. He may now enjoy in the honourable repoſe which his exploits have purchaſed for himſelf and his country, the beſt of rewards, the conſciouſneſs of public ſervice. Poſterity will conſider him as the deliverer of Germany.</p>
                        <p>The Engliſh troops, after ſo many fatigues and dangers, at length enjoyed the proſpect of a ſpeedy return to their country; but a general damp was caſt ſuddenly on their joy by the illneſs of lord Granby; who was attacked by a very dangerous and long continued fever,

<pb n="542" facs="tcp:1261701201:612"/>
to expreſs the concern of the whole army during this anxious interval, or the joy which enlivened every breaſt on his recovery. No commander had ever been more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed for an enterpriſing and generous courage; and none half ſo much for an unlimitted benevolence. The ſick and wounded ſoldier, the officer whoſe income was unequal to his rank or his neceſſities, in him found a never failing and never burthenſome reſource. Whatever could be done to animate the ſoldiery, to make them chearful in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to alleviate the hardſhips of war, was exerted beyond what could be thought poſſible in the limits of a private for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and the ſatisfaction of the giver went always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the actual benefit, becauſe in his greateſt liberality, it was evident that he wiſhed to do a thouſand times more.

                        <p>WHILST the courts of London and Verſailles Were making ſo conſiderable a progreſs towards peace, thoſe of Vienna and Berlin ſeemed to remit nothing of their antient animoſity. The king of Pruſſia, deprived of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, but at the ſame time freed from the hoſtilities of the Ruſſians directed his whole force and attention towards the ſingle object of driving the Auſtrians out of Sileſia.</p>
                        <p>Prince Henry, who commanded in Saxony, contented himſelf with acting upon the defenſive. The king in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon carried on the ſiege of Schweidnitz, almoſt in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of marſhal Daun, who ſcarce made any attempts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. But whatever deficiency there might have been in the ſpirit of the grand army of the Auſtrians, it was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply compenſated by the obſtinate bravery of the garriſon, which reſiſted all the attacks of the Pruſſians for near two months from the opening of the trenches. It is ſaid that the attack was conducted, and the defence made, by two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineers, who had written on the ſubject of the attack and defence of places; and they were now practically engaged to prove the ſuperiority of their ſeveral ſyſtems.</p>
                        <p>However this may be, Schweidnitz coſt the king of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia a great deal of time, many laborious efforts, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men. The brave garriſon, to the number of eight thouſand men,

priſoners were drowned at the mouth of the Oder, on their paſſage to their intended confinement at Konigſberg: only nine men of the whole number eſcaped.</p>
                        <p>The king of Pruſſia now maſter of Schweidnitz, and conſequently of Sileſia, turned his attention to Saxony, where he conſiderably reinforced his brother's army and made preparations which indicated a deſign of laying ſiege to Dreſden.</p>
                        <p>In Saxony alſo the Auſtrians began to exert themſelves with great ſpirit; and made ſome progreſs under the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals Stolberg, and Haddick. They obtained conſiderable advantages, in ſeveral encounters, over the army of prince Henry; and even puſhed them back to Freyberg; the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of which place they prepared to diſpute with the Pruſſians.</p>
                        <p>But here fortune, which has ſeldom proved long conſtant to their arms, entirely forſook them. The united army of Imperaliſts and Auſtrians was attacked by prince Henry,

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Oct. 29."/> 

 (who took advantage of the abſence of general Haddick,) in the neighbourhood of Freyberg, and totally routed. Great numbers were ſlain. The Pruſſians took near ſix thouſand priſoners, among whom were about two hundred and forty officers of all ranks, thirty pieces of cannon, and ſeveral ſtandards. The victory was complete, and, as far as regarded the event of the campaign, deciſive.</p>
                        <p>The Auſtrians attributed this defeat to the treachery of one of their ſuperior officers, who was ſoon after taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to cuſtody. But whilſt they were inquiring into the cauſe of their diſaſter, and preparing to puniſh the author of it, the Pruſſians were puſhing the advantages which their vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory afforded them with all imaginable alacrity. And this they were enabled to do with the greateſt effect, by means of a partial ceſſation of hoſtilities, which the Auſtrians were ſo imprudent as to conclude with the king of Pruſſia for Sileſia and the electoral Saxony only, without foreſeeing the danger, or providing for the ſafety, either of their own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate dominions, or of thoſe members of the Empire, which were the moſt attached to their intereſts, and which were now expoſed to the attempts of a bold, rapacious, and exaſperated enemy.</p>
                        <p>One body of the Pruſſian army broke into Bohemia, puſhed on almoſt to the gates of Prague, and deſtroyed a capital magazine. Another fell upon the ſame country on
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:1261701201:617"/>
another quarter, and laid the town of Egra almoſt in aſhes, by a bombardment and a cannonade of red hot bullets. Some extended themſelves all over Saxony; others pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated into the furtheſt parts of Franconia, and even as far as Suabia, ravaging the country; exacting the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant contributions, and ſpreading diſmay and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon every ſide. The dyet of the Empire ſitting at Ratiſbon did not think themſelves in ſafety; but were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to fly and preparing to remove their records.</p>
                        <p>The free city of Nuremberg, ſo famous for the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious induſtry, and pacific diſpoſition of its inhabitants, ſuffered the moſt by this invaſion; having been obliged to pay contribution to the amount of two hundred thouſand pounds of our money. It has been ſuppoſed, that in this expedition the Pruſſians raiſed a ſum equal to the annual ſubſidy, which had formerly been paid by Great Britain to their ſovereign. Many of the ſtates found themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to ſign a neutrality, in order to ſave their territories from further ravages.</p>
                        <p>And now a great part of the Empire being already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the peace between Great Britain and France, and the reſt, tied down by this neutrality, entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by the late defeat, or exhauſted by the ſubſequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, were no longer in a condition to furniſh an army under the imperial name and authority. After the whole al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance had been thus gradually diſſolved, the affair was, at length, left to be decided as it was begun, by the ſingle arms of Auſtria and Pruſſia; ſo that there was great reaſon to hope, as the war in Germany had ſucceeded immediately to the rupture between Great Britain and France, the peace between theſe powers would alſo lead to the ſpeedy pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Empire.</p>
                        <p>The preliminaries had been ſigned by the Britiſh and French miniſters at Fountainbleau, on the third of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, and it is neceſſary for the completion of our deſign, that we ſhould here give ſome account of the definitive treaty which was built upon them.</p>
                        <p>The reader will recollect, that, in the negotiation of 1761, it was laid down as a principal by the two courts, that their reſpective propoſitions, in caſe the treaty ſhould by any accident be broken off, were to be conſidered as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted or never made. At that time we remarked, that theſe propoſitions would probably have their influence, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

this proviſion; becauſe, as we then obſerved, things once ſettled and agreed to, unavoidably ſtamp their own impreſſion upon any future negotiation relative to the ſame ſubject. It happened very nearly, as was then fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen; for, as far as we can judge, the negotiation did not ſet out upon any new or peculiar principle of its own, but ſeemed to aſſume as a baſis thoſe points, which were near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to an adjuſtment in the preceding treaty; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence where that tranſaction concluded.</p>
                        <p>The ſpirit of the two negotiations, ſo far as regarded the peculiar intereſt of Great Britain, ſeems to have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſimilar. There was ſcarcely any other difference, than that Great Britain, in conſequence of her ſucceſſes ſince that time, acquired more than ſhe then demanded; but ſtill the general idea, on which ſhe acquired, was near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or altogether the ſame. But with regard to ſome of our allies, the principal was greatly varied; and we imagine that this change was ſufficiently juſtified by the alteration which happened in the affairs of Germany, during the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval between the two treaties. Thoſe who conducted the negotiation in 1761, were ſteady in rejecting every propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, in which they were not left at liberty to aid the king of Pruſſia, with the whole force of Great Britain; thoſe, who concluded the peace in 1762, paid leſs attention to the intereſts, though they did not wholly neglect the ſafety of that monarch. At the beginning of the year, and before they had entered into the negotiation, they refuſed to renew that article of the annual treaty, by which our court had engaged to conclude no peace without the king of Pruſſia; though at the ſame time they declared themſelves willing to aſſiſt him with the uſual ſubſidy. He on his part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the ſubſidy unconnected with that article. Some cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs grew between the two courts from this time forward.</p>
                        <p>The adjuſtment of affairs in the Empire, ſeemed to form no material impediment to the progreſs of the treaty. Both parties readily agreed to withdraw themſelves totally from the German was. They thought and rightly, that nothing could tend ſo much to give peace to their reſpective allies, as mutually to withdraw their aſſiſtance from them; and to ſtop that current of Engliſh and French money, which, as long as it ran into Germany, would be ſure to feed a perpetual war in that country.</p>
                        <p>Circumſtanced as affairs then were, this conduct on our
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:1261701201:621"/>
ſide was as defenſible as the conduct which we held in 1761. At that time the affairs of the king of Pruſſia were at the loweſt ebb; he was overpowered by the whole weight of Auſtria, of Sweden, of the Empire, and of Ruſſia, as determined as ever, in her enmity, and then ſucceſsful; to ſay nothing of France. Neither generoſity, nor perhaps ſound policy, ought to have permitted us to deſert him in that ſituation. But when the laſt treaty was made, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his affairs was abſolutely reverſed. He had got rid of the moſt powerful, and one of the moſt implacable of his enemies. He had concluded a peace with Sweden. The treaty itſelf freed him from all apprehenſions of France. He had then none to contend with, but a nominal army of the Empire, and one of Auſtria, which, though ſomething more than nominal, was wholly unable to oppoſe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. His ſituation, from being pitiable, was become formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. It was good policy to prevent the ballance of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many from being overturned to his prejudice. It would have been the worſt in the world to overturn it in his favour.</p>
                        <p>Theſe principles ſufficiently explain and juſtify the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent conduct of this nation, at theſe two periods, towards the king of Pruſſia. The demand of the evacuation of Weſel, Cleves, and Gueldres, which had been made in the firſt negotiation was then juſtly excepted to, becauſe we refuſed to put an end to the German war. In this laſt the French agreed to it, and with reaſon, becauſe we agreed in common with them to be neutral in the diſputes of the Empire. And on theſe principles, the peace of Germany, ſo far as it depended on Great Britain and France, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. The reſt of Europe was pacified by the ſtipulation for the evacuation of Portugal. This was indeed, with regard to the contracting courts, the primary object.</p>
                        <p>What remained after the concerns of the allies were provided for, was the adjuſtment of what related to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements and commerce of Great Britain and the Bourbon courts. The difficulty, which prevented this adjuſtment in the preceding negotiation, was the intervention of the claims of Spain. The attempts of the Bourbon powers to intermix and confound their affairs in the preceding nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, had a ſhare in making the war more general; on this occaſion it had a contrary effect. As the whole was negotiated together, it facilitated the peace, by affording eaſier methods of adjuſting the ſyſtem of compenſation, and
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:1261701201:622"/>
furniſhing more largely to the general fund of equavalents.</p>
                        <p>The great object, and the original cauſe of the war, had been the ſettlement of limits in America. This was therefore the firſt object to be attended to in the treaty. And it muſt be obſerved, that this point was much more accurately, as well as beneficially, ſettled, than it promiſed to be in the negotiation of the foregoing year. For the French, not having aſcertained the bounds between their own ſeveral poſſeſſions with great exactneſs, than they had thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their poſſeſſions and ours, it was not clear in ceding Canada, how much they ceded to us. Diſputes might have ariſen, and did indeed immediately ariſe upon this ſubject, beſides, the weſtern limits of our ſouthern conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental colonies, were not mentioned. And thoſe limits were extremely obſcure and ſubject to many diſcuſſions. Such diſcuſſions contained in them the ſeeds of a new war, In the laſt treaty it was agreed, that a line drawn along the middle of the river Miſſiſippi, from its ſource to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Iberville, (a ſmall but navigable branch of the Miſſiſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,) and thence along the middle of this river, and the lakes of Maurepas and Pontchartrain, (which lakes communicate with both rivers) to the ſea, ſhould be the bounds of the two nations in North America.</p>
                        <p>Nothing could be more diſtinct than this boundary. It gave us, in addition to what was properly Canada, a very large tract of territory, which the French uſed to include under the name of Louiſania; to which our claims were never clearly aſcertained, and much leſs eſtabliſhed by any poſſeſſion. The French have had for a long time forts and ſettlements in that country; whereas the Engliſh never had either the one or the other; and this is a conſideration of no ſmall moment in a conteſt concering rights in a country ſuch as America.</p>
                        <p>What added alſo to the rounding of our territories, and cutting off the occaſions of limitary diſputes, was the ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Florida on the part of Spain. This country indeed makes no great figure in the commercial world; and cannot be therefore put in competition with the other conqueſts, But from the ſituation of its harbours of Penſacola and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile, it affords ſome advantages in the time of peace, and very conſiderable ones in time of war; by connecting our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſettlements on the Miſſiſippi with thoſe upon the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic ocean, and by enabling us greatly to diſtreſs, if not
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:1261701201:623"/>
wholly to deſtroy the trade of the Spaniards in caſe of a rupture with them. The navigation of the Miſſiſippi was made common to both nations.</p>
                        <p>By the treaty of Utrecht, which ſettled our northern limits, and by this treaty which aſcertained thoſe to the weſt, our poſſeſſions in America are as well defined, as the nature of ſuch a country can poſſibly admit. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in their extent the foundation of a vaſt empire; they have many advantages of ſoil and climate; and many of intercourſe and communication, by the number of noble lakes and navigable rivers, with which that part of the world abounds. Theſe circumſtances afford, though a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, a fair proſpect of commerce to Great Britain, when this immenſe country comes to be fully peopled, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly cultivated. Some advantages alſo we derive from this poſſeſſion, that are not only conſiderable but immediate; among the principal of which muſt be reckoned, the mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly of the furr and peltry trade of North America, much the greateſt trade of that kind in the world, and which is now, we may ſay, entirely in our hands. Beſides the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Canada enlarged the ſphere of our fiſhery, and took from the French an opportunity of trade, which ſhe might employ greatly to our detriment.</p>
                        <p>Such are the advantages fairly, and without any exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for which we are indebted to this part of the treaty, in which the intereſts of Great Britain were well weighed and ſolidly provided for.</p>
                        <p>The next point we ſhall conſider, is the arangement made concerning the Newfoundland fiſhery, This was a point of infinite importance, and a ſubject of much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. In a commercial view it is certainly of great eſtimation. But it has been conſidered as even more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial in a political light. Every body knows that theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive fiſheries are the life of many maritime places, which would otherwiſe be of no ſort of value; that they are the great nurſeries of ſeamen, and conſequently the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources of the marine. Scarce any object could be of more importance to two nations, who contended for a ſuperiority in naval power.</p>
                        <p>The more clearly therefore it was the intereſt of Great Britain, to acquire the excluſive exerciſe of this fiſhery, the more ſtrongly and evidently it became the intereſt of France to oppoſe themſelves to ſuch a pretenſion. Not only a large part of her foreign trade depended on this fiſhery, but a
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:1261701201:624"/>
great part of her domeſtic ſupply. Beſides every hope of the ſtrength and almoſt of the exiſtence of a naval power, muſt vaniſh with the ceſſion of this fiſhery.</p>
                        <p>The Engliſh adminiſtration probably ſaw, that France would rather run all the hazards of war, than totally relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh this object. Since therefore they deſpaired of driving the French entirely from the fiſhery, they endeavoured as much as poſſible to diminiſh its value to them. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they followed the plan of the former negotiation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that ſome improvements were added.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt place, that article of the treaty of Utrecht was eſtabliſhed, by which the French were admitted to fiſh, and to dry their fiſh, on the north-eaſt and north-weſt parts of Newfoundland, from Cape Bonaviſta to Point Biche, and excluded from the reſt of this iſland. They were alſo permitted to fiſh within the Gulph of St. Lawrence, but with this limitation, that they ſhall not approach within three leagues of any of the coaſts belonging to England.</p>
                        <p>This precaution was taken, not only with a view of abridging the French fiſhery of dry cod, but principally in order to prevent their landing, and on that pretence forming ſettlements on thoſe extenſive deſarts, which ſurrounded the Gulph of St. Lawrence. Otherwiſe this privilege might become a means of exciting new controverſies between the two nations.</p>
                        <p>In compenſation for the ceſſion of the iſles of Cape Breton and St. John to England, we agreed to ſurrender to France the ſmall iſland of St. Pierre and Miquelon, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the ſouth of Newfoundland. The ceſſion of the two former iſlands was, unqueſtionably, more than an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent for the two latter, though the latter are by no means either incommodiouſly ſituated or ill circumſtanced for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the fiſhery. The French ſtipulated to erect no fortifications on theſe iſlands, nor to keep more than fifty ſoldiers to enforce the police. In this inſtance the plan of the former negotiation was purſued. The ideas of a reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent commiſſary, and the occaſional viſitation by a ſhip of war were omitted; as regulations, which were in truth more humiliating to France, than in any reſpect advantageous to our intereſt.</p>
                        <p>The fiſhery was, as it had been at the treaty of Utrecht, divided between France and England, but with leſs equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on this than on that occaſion. The French are not
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:1261701201:625"/>
wholly deprived of their ſhare; but this ſhare is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably impaired. Their loſs of Cape Breton does not appear to be fully ſupplied by St. Pierre and Miquelon. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and growing fiſhery, which the French had ſettled at Gaſpe is taken away without hope of recovery. On the whole, we are thus circumſtanced; we have advantages in this fiſhery, which we may certainly improve to a great ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority; but we have ſtill a rival, which makes it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to exert ourſelves with unremitting induſtry in order to ſecure it.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Spain, ſhe entirely <hi>deſiſted</hi> from the right ſhe claimed of fiſhing on theſe coaſts. A more ſatisfactory expreſſion could have been wiſhed; if it had been of great importance, in what terms a right was renounced, which for a long time had never been exerciſed.</p>
                        <p>When the affairs of the Weſt Indies came to be ſettled, though they cauſed great difference of opinion among the publick, they do not ſeem to have raiſed any great difficulty in the negotiation. We had here made great conqueſts, and here alſo we made great conceſſions. We ceded the Havannah, with a conſiderable part of the iſland of Cuba; the iſlands of Martinico; Gaudeloupe; Mariegalante; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirade; and Santa Lucia. We retained in our hands the iſlands of Tobago, Dominica, St. Vincent, and the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nades. To the three former, of which, (as well as to Santa Lucia, which we ſurrendered) we had an old claim. The laſt only was a new acquiſition; and the three others are at preſent of ſmall value.</p>
                        <p>Many cenſured with great vehemence and aſperity this part of the treaty. They inſiſted that in this treaty we had loſt ſight of that great fundamental principal, that France is chiefly, if not ſolely, to be dreaded by us in the light of a maritime and commerical power. That therefore we had, by reſtoring to her all her valuable Weſt India iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and by our conceſſions in the Newfoundland fiſhery, left in her hands the means of recovering her prodigious loſſes, and of becoming once more formidable to us at ſea. That the fiſhery trained up an innumerable multitude of young ſeamen; and that the Weſt India trade employed them when they were trained. That France had long ſince gained a decided ſuperiority over us in this lucrative branch of commerce, and ſupplied almoſt all Europe with the rich commodities, which are produced only in that part of the

world. By this commerce, ſaid they, ſhe enriched her merchants and augmented her finances; whilſt from a want of ſugar land, which has been long known and ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felt by England, we at once loſt the foreign trade, and ſuffered all the inconveniences of a monopoly at home.</p>
                        <p>That, at the cloſe of ſo expenſive a war, we might very reaſonably demand ſomething towards our indemnification, as well as towards our ſecurity. It is evident ſaid they, that our conqueſts in North America, however, they may provide for the one, are altogether inadequate to the other of theſe ends. The ſtate of the exiſting trade of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts is extremely low; the ſpeculations of their future are precarious, and the proſpect, at the very beſt, very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote. We ſtand in need of ſupplies, which will have an effect, certain, ſpeedy, and conſiderable. The retaining both, or even one of the conſiderable French iſlands, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinico or Guadeloupe, will, and nothing elſe can effectually anſwer this tripple purpoſe. The advantage is immediate. It is a matter not of conjecture but of account. The trade with theſe conqueſts is of the moſt lucrative nature, and of the moſt conſiderable extent; the number of ſhips employed by it are a great reſource to our maritime power; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly at home is corrected, and the foreign trade is reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. And what is of equal weight, all that we gain on this ſyſtem, is made fourfold to us, by the loſs which enſues to France. But our conqueſts in North America, however ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous they may prove to us, in the idea of ſecurity, (for in that reſpect alone they are of any moment) are of very little detriment to the commerce of France. On the Weſt India ſcheme of acquiſition, our gain and her loſs go hand in hand.</p>
                        <p>They inſiſted upon the obvious connection of this trade, with that of our colonies in North America, and with our commerce to the coaſt of Africa. The African trade, ſaid they, will be augmented, by the demand for ſlaves. That of North America will all center in ourſelves. Whereas if the iſlands are all reſtored, a great part of the benefit of the northern colony trade muſt redound, as it has hitherto done, to thoſe who were lately our enemies, and will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be our rivals.</p>
                        <p>They obſerved, that there was nothing extravagant or overbearing in this demand. That though we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain either Martinico or Guadeloupe, or even both theſe
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:1261701201:627"/>
iſlands, our conqueſts were ſuch, that there was ſtill abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant matter left to diſplay our moderation in the ceſſion of the reſt. To ſay nothing of our many conceſſions in the fiſhery; on the coaſt of Africa; and in the Eaſt Indies; from all which great provinces of commerce the French had been entirely driven this war, and to a conſiderable ſhare of which they were reſtored by the treaty. But if further conceſſions muſt be made (for which however they ſaw no neceſſity) let the prodigious demand in North Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica be ſomewhat contracted; by this method we looſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our commerce; and we do not hazard our ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as we ſhall ſtill be infinitely ſuperior in ſtrength; and whenever a war breaks out, that power will be moſt ſecure, whoſe reſources are moſt conſiderable.</p>
                        <p>Such are conciſely, and, we flatter ourſelves, fairly, the principal heads of argument, brought by the beſt writers upon this ſide of the queſtion; they were replied to by the beſt writers on the other, upon the following principles.</p>
                        <p>That the original object of the war was the ſecurity of our colonies upon the continent; that the danger to which theſe colonies were expoſed, and in conſequence of that danger, the immenſe waſte of blood and treaſure which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued to Great Britain, together with the calamities, which were from the ſame ſource, derived upon the four quart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the world, left no ſort of doubt that it was not only our beſt, but our only policy, to guard againſt all poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the return of ſuch evils. Experience has ſhewn us that while France poſſeſſes any ſingle place in America, from whence ſhe may moleſt our ſettlements, they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoy any repoſe, and of courſe that we are never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from being plunged again into thoſe calamities, from which we have at length, and with ſo much difficulty, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily emerged. To remove France from our neighbourhood in America, or to contract her power within the narroweſt limits poſſible, is therefore the moſt capital advantage we can obtain; and is worth purchaſing by almoſt any conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                        <p>They inſiſted that the abſolute ſecurity derived from this plan, included in itſelf an indemnification. Firſt; by ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, more effectually than any other method could, from the neceſſity of another war, and conſequently by giving us an opportunity of increaſing our trade, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering our debt. Secondly; by permitting our colonies on

he continent to extend themſelves without danger or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation. They ſhewed the great increaſe of poppulation in thoſe colonies within a few years. They ſhewed that their trade with the mother country had uniformly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with this population. That being now freed from the moleſtation of enemies, and the emulations of rivals, unlimited in their poſſeſſions, and ſafe in their perſons, our American planters would by the very courſe of their natural propogation in a very ſhort time, furniſh out a demand of our manufactures, as large as all the working hands of Great Britain could poſſibly ſupply. That there was therefore no reaſon to dread that want of trade, which their adverſaries inſinuated, ſince North America alone would ſupply the deficiences of our trade in every other part of the world.</p>
                        <p>They expatiated on the great variety of climates, which that country contained, and the vaſt reſources which would thence ariſe to commerce. That the value of our conqueſts thereby ought not to be eſtimated by the preſent produce, but by their probable increaſe, Neither ought the value of any country to be ſolely tried on its commercial advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; that extent of territory and a number of ſubjects, are matters of as much conſideration to a ſtate attentive to the ſources of real grandeur, as the mere advantages of traffic; that ſuch ideas are rather ſuitable to a limited and petty commonwealth, like Holland, than to a great, powerful and warlike nation. That on theſe principles, having made very large demands in North America, it was neceſſary to relax in other parts. That France would never be brought to any conſiderable ceſſion in the Weſt Indies; but that her power and increaſe there could never become formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe the exiſtence of her ſettlements depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ours in North America, ſhe not being any longer left a place from whence they can be ſupplied with proviſions; that in loſing ſomething of the ſugar trade, we loſt very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle elſe than a luxury: as to the other produce of the Weſt Indies, it might be in a great meaſure, and in part already was ſupplied by our poſſeſſions on the continent, which dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſed not only in the quantity but in the kind of its produce.</p>
                        <p>We do not pretend to paſs any judgment on the merits of the ſeveral ſides of this queſtion, which is certainly a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult one. We relate opinions, as well as facts, hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torically.</p>

                           <pb n="555" facs="tcp:1261701201:631"/>The only point, which remained to be adjuſted in the Weſt Indies, was the logwood trade. Spain conſented not to diſturb the Engliſh in their occupation of cutting log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood in the bay of Honduras, and to permit them to occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſuch buildings as may be neceſſary for them in this occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. Great Britain, on her ſide, ſtipulated to deſtroy the fortifications which had been erected on that bay

.</p>
                        <p>By this article the Engliſh acquired a ſolid right in this long conteſted trade; but ſeemed at the ſame time, to loſe all the means of protecting it. It is, however, difficult to point out a better method of adjuſting a claim of ſuch a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar nature. The right we claimed was not a right to the territory, nor directly to the produce; but only a privilege of cutting and taking away this wood by indulgence. To have inſiſted on the right of erecting fortifications, would have been making the ſtrongeſt claim to an abſolute, direct and excluſive dominion over the territory itſelf; a point, to which I do not find that our moſt extenſive claims have ever been carried.</p>
                        <p>In Africa, Goree was reſtored to France, and Senegal remained to Great Britain 

<note n="†" place="bottom">Def. tr. art. x.</note>

. This regulation ſeems to have divided the trade on this river, and the adjacent coaſt, between the two nations. The Engliſh as they are now circumſtanced on that part, ſeem to be the moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly ſituated for the trade in time of peace; and the French for carrying away the whole of it in time of war.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the Eaſt Indies, all the French factories and ſettlements are reſtored to that nation in every part of India

: Although this muſt be regarded as a very great conceſſion, it does not however afford all thoſe advantages to France, which might be imagined at the firſt view. Firſt, becauſe the fortifications erected at ſuch a vaſt expence in all thoſe ſettlements have been totally deſtroyed; and it cannot be expected, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation of the French company, that they can, in the courſe of many years, if at all, be reſtored to their former ſtate; in Bengal, (including, by an explanation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the definitive treaty, the kingdom of Orixa.) they have engaged to erect no kind of fortification, nor to keep any number of ſoldiers whatſoever. Secondly, they have agreed to acknowledge the preſent reigning ſubas of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, Decan, and the Carnatick, as the lawful ſovereigns of
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:1261701201:632"/>
theſe countries. Theſe princes are the greateſt on the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſula of India: they are in our intereſt, and moſt of them owe either the acquiſition, or depend for the preſervation of their power upon our arms; by which means our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is become, in effect, arbiter of the commerce and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics of that great and opulent coaſt, extending from the Ganges to Cape Comorin; and in a great degree alſo of the other, from the ſame cape to the mouth of the Indus. Thirdly, during the courſe of our ſucceſſes, the traders and the manufacturers have removed from the French to our ſettlements, where they will have at leaſt an equal market, and a ſuperior protection; and it will be difficult, if not impoſſible, to bring them back.</p>

                        <p>This is the general outline of the late treaty. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars given here will ſerve to point out the ſpirit and the general effect of that tranſaction, which has been the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſo much heat and controverſy; and which nothing but adulation will aſſert to be free from defect, nor any thing but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>action can deny to be productive of many very great and eſſential advantages to this kingdom.</p>
                        <p>This treaty, while it remained in agitation, formed a great criſis, not only in the affairs of the nation, but in the fortune of the new miniſtry. Towards the latter end of the ſummer Mr. Fox was called in, and engaged in their ſupport. Though he continued in his old place of paymaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he undertook to conduct the affairs, of government in the houſe of commons. Mr. Grenville, whoſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would naturally have engaged him in that taſk, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the ſeals of ſecretary of ſtate, and was appointed firſt lord of the admiralty. The great experience and known parliamentary abilities of Mr. Fox, ſeemed to give new life to the affairs of the adminiſtration. A more vigorous and determined conduct was from that time adopted. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe, who were not perfectly attached to the new ſyſtem, were immediately removed from their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and meaſures were taken to clear every department of every friend of the Duke of Newcaſtle.</p>
                        <p>The ſpirit of theſe proceedings ſeemed to augment that
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:1261701201:633"/>
of the oppoſition. It was apprehended, that the prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries would undergo a rigorous ſcrutiny, and might poſſibly incur a heavy cenſure from parliament. The terms of peace were criticiſed without mercy. They were declared to be inglorious, inadequate, and inſecure; unequal to the great ſucceſſes of the war, and below the juſt expectations of the nation; that our commerce was neglected, and our allies abandoned. Public expectation was however entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed. The preliminaries were approved, without any qualification, by both houſes; by the lords with out any diviſion;

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Dec. 9."/> 

 by the commons with a very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportioned majority.</p>
                        <p>Many cauſes concurred to produce this moderate diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Firſt, a very great number, which included almoſt all the Tories, were engaged in the ſupport of the adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration. The then chiefs of the oppoſition were not well agreed among themſelves. Mr. Pitt who was conſidered as a party in himſelf, had not joined with the duke of Newcaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, nor ſeemed diſpoſed to act with any particular body. The ſame general plan of peace, which many now in the oppoſition had formerly approved, had been adopted in theſe preliminaries, and evidently improved. It is true, it had been objected, that our additional ſucceſſes, ſince that time, gave us ground to expect better terms; but it was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that our national burthens, and the extent of the war, had increaſed in, at leaſt, an equal proportion; and that peace was become neceſſary to the nation.</p>
                        <p>Theſe arguments whatever weight they might have in themſelves, were ſtrong againſt theſe, upon whom they were rather retorted, than for the firſt time levelled, being altogether agreable to the ſyſtem which many now in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition had always purſued, and to the ſentiments many of them had publickly avowed, and perhaps ſtill ſecretly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. On the whole, it was evident, that, when the queſtion came on, the diſcontented party was found not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well united, and abſolutely unprovided of any regular ſcheme of oppoſition. However, though baffled on this occaſion, it has ſince begun to revive and to unite; and though peace is happily reſtored with foreign powers, our domeſtic quiet is ſtill far from being ſecurely eſtabliſhed.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the powers in Germany, the peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween England and France, and the ſuperiority of the king of Pruſſia at the cloſe of the campaign, inſpired, at length,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:1261701201:634"/>
though unwillingly, a diſpoſition to peace. Conferences were opened at Hubertſberg, and a treaty concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Pruſſian majeſty and the empreſs queen. As af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in this treaty were ſpeedily adjuſted, ſo they may be very conciſely related. The ſubſtance of it was no more than that a mutual reſtitution and oblivion ſhould take place, and each party ſit down at the end of the war in the ſame ſituation in which they began it. Thus the king of Pruſſia, after having for ſix years contended againſt the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of almoſt all the great powers of Europe, by whoſe enmity he could be affected, having ſtood proof againſt the moſt terrible blows of fortune, enjoys at length the full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his uncommon magnanimity. He retains his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions in their utmoſt extent; and having delivered his country by his incomparable talents for war, he now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys leiſure to recover it by his no leſs admirable talents for government. Scarcely was the war concluded, when he began to diſplay his attention to domeſtic policy, and his care for the happineſs of his people. He imediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed lands to his diſbanded ſoldiery; and gave them the horſes of his artillery to aid them in their cultivation.</p>
                        <p>Europe is new pacified; and ſhe begins to reſpire, after a more general and a more bloody war than any the world had experienced ſince that which was concluded by the peace of Weſtphalia. As far as it is ſafe to judge concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſyſtem which is ſubject to ſo great and unforeſeen va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations, and ſometimes from very ſlight cauſes, this peace promiſes a conſiderable duration. The king of Pruſſia will hardly again commit his affairs, ſo miraculouſly retrieved to the chances of war. He ſees how dearly he has a ſecond time purchaſed his conqueſt of Sileſia, and he will hardly aim at new acquiſitions. The empreſs, ſince ſhe failed to reduce Sileſia, or even to recover the ſmalleſt particle of her loſſes, with ſuch an exertion of her own ſtrength, and with ſuch an alliance as never was ſeen united before, and with which ſhe can never flatter herſelf again, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced how vain it is to attempt any change in the preſent ſyſtem in Germany.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt Ruſſia remained circumſtanced as ſhe ſeems to be at preſent, there is a very good proſpect for the tranquillity of the North.</p>
                        <p>France has turned her thoughts to a much wanted oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy and the re-eſtabliſhment of her marine, ſhe has
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:1261701201:635"/>
reduced her land forces, by above one half. England, with out leſſening the ordinary eſtabliſhment of her navy, has augmented her military, in conſequence of the extent of her conqueſts. Both nations ſeem ſenſible of the neceſſity of being prepared, and yet quiet. The Bourbon courts are united but weakened. The mutual jealouſy of the nations, which have been lately at war, continues; but their ſubjects of diſpute, and occaſions of animoſity, are much leſſened. This is as good a ſituation as could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be expected.</p>
                        <p>We have thus accompliſhed our deſign of laying before the public a connected narrative of the events of the late moſt remarkable war, which we have purſued from its commencement to its concluſion. We have omitted no care to make it as perfect as the nature of ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking would permit; and we flatter ourſelves, that it will be thought as impartial, and ſatisfactory, as any work of the kind extant.</p>
