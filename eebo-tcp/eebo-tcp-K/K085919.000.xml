            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I was the means of lifting up the peck loaf two-pence laſt week; and have another petition from the bakers to the court of aldermen in my pocket; it's penned in ſuch a lamentable ſtile, that I don't doubt, with one or two more, working up to a ſhilling.</p>

But I don't ſo much blame him for this, if he had any brains: why the blockhead, in five years trade for himſelf, never had ſenſe enough to make a loaf two or three ounces ſhort; and is ſo plaguy conſcientious, as not to uſe any allum, becauſe its unwholeſome.—Time for me to look ſharp, maſter Tilwell.</p>

                     <p>Politic, politic.—If all the fiſh that's caught was brought to market, and all the meat that's killed ſold, both would ſoon be a drug. There is one inſtance among many—Mat. Marrow-bone, of Honey-lane market, as pretty a fellow as ever whetted a knife, will frequently, rather than take a halfpenny a pound under the fixed price on Saturday night, tip ten guineas worth into the Thames on Sunday morning. He has ſhow'd me his Thames regiſter, and a ſweet pretty collection of drowned joints there is. However, I adviſed him for the future, to bury all; becauſe, you know, in the water it may feed and increaſe the ſtock of fiſh, which might hurt the fleſh trade. Mat. took the hint—ah, he's a ſenſible ſpirited fellow as ever ſold thirteen ounces for a pound; and can afford to live genteelly.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0681500800:13"/>

                     <p>Yes, we have ſeven every week; the fore-ſtalling one meets Sunday afternoon, at Iſling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, to tax Monday's market at Smithfield; on Monday the ſtaff-of-life committee meet in Mark Lane, to ſettle how much a quarter; on Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the coal committee, to pray for ſtrong eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly winds three months together the beginning of winter; Wedneſday the provender committee, to ſettle hay, ſtraw, and oats; Thurſday the Billingſgate committee, to price fiſh; Friday the monopolizing committee, to engroſs hops; and on Saturday the brewing committee, to make, as ſoon as poſſible, beer four pence a pot.</p>

                     <p>Fair game, maſter Tilwell, the public is very fair game. But you don't like the ſubject, I ſee; till you think better of it, we'll change it—I had almoſt forgot to wiſh you joy.</p>

                     <speaker>TILWELL.</speaker>
                     <p>What has he got a good bargain of tobacco?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>SKINFLINT.</speaker>
                     <p>So I find their hurry and joy have made them forget you.—The lottery ticket you gave your youngeſt daughter Anna, is come up a blank—that to Deborah, your eldeſt, twenty thouſand pounds.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>TILWELL.</speaker>
                     <p>Twenty thouſand pounds!</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>SKINFLINT.</speaker>
                     <p>Certainly; the tobacco trade was given up in three days, a houſe was taken near Groſvenor-Square in three more, a French valet, a French cook, an Italian waiting woman, and a long &amp;c. have been engaged within the laſt week.</p>

                     <speaker>TILWELL.</speaker>
                     <p>You aſtoniſh me! I muſt go immediately to this new ſhop of politeneſs.—Fortune ſeldom grants her favours right, elſe poor Anna, who deſerves ten times as much as Deb. would have had the prize.</p>

                     <p>Well, I promiſed to call at the Exchequer to day about it—for it muſt be ſold immediately—and I'll meet you at Dan's in leſs than two hours.</p>

                     <p>A French cook! a French valet! and an Italian waiting woman!—Why good luck has turned the brains of the ideots, if they ever had any, upſide down—But this methodical miniſter of famine; what muſt I think of him? that no monſter in human ſhape can exceed that man who labours to increaſe the miſery, and to prey on the vitals of the poor.

                     <p>Ay, ay; I met with a very fine lady, all ſilks and ſattins, who fell downright in love with me.</p>

                     <speaker>TIM.</speaker>
                     <p>Free! Oh la, as free as any thing: ſhe aſked me to take a glaſs of wine; I could not for ſhame refuſe her; ſo ſhe told me ſhe was a knight and baronet's daughter, that ſhe would take me to her papa's houſe in ſomething ſquare, but was afraid till ſhe knew how the land lay.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0681500800:17"/>
Why ſhe told me ſuch things as would make one's hair ſtand an end; about one man flying ten feet high on a rope; another jumping with a ladder like any thing; and another, O la! riding full ſpeed with his head on a pint pot; and other moſt wonderful conjurations.</p>

                  <p>Why this ſon-in-law and daughter of mine, are as hard to be ſeen as if he was a Lord and ſhe a Lady.—Well, Sir Francis, I am a plain man, and thank you heartily, though not in fine words, for the honourable propoſal you have made my girl, Anna; though, to be ſure, ſhe could never have expected ſuch a match, yet, I ſay it that ſhould not ſay it, ſhe's as much above her ſiſter Deborah, as good wheat is above tares.</p>

                  <p>It was for that ſuperiority beyond compariſon, I firſt conceived, and have ſince cheriſhed a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for your daughter. Nature has been very kind to her perſon, yet more ſo to her mind.</p>

                  <p>I think ſo too—and, Sir Francis, if ſhe has no objections, I can't have any. But this by the bye—I would not have her married to an Emperor againſt her liking.</p>
