            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>This <hi>White King</hi> you may plainly ſee by th Deſcription is meant for the <hi>French</hi> King, who ha been ſo long foretold to be a <hi>Tyrant</hi> over his People and a <hi>Scourge</hi> to the Neighbouring Nations, as th <hi>Prophets</hi> of old deliver'd in dark Miſteries thei <hi>Propheſies</hi> concerning the coming of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the down-fall of the <hi>Perſian Monarchy</hi> under <hi>Darius;</hi> and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The Time when the <hi>White King</hi> ſhall raiſe the <hi>Dead Man,</hi> and the Signs of his <hi>Coming.</hi> The Time when this ſhall come to paſs ſhall be the time after <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall loſe the Diſtinction of their former Names, and be ſwallow'd up in their Original Name of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> And the Sign that ſhall be given ſhall be that when <hi>Falſe Prophets</hi> ariſe, and ſhall pretend to raiſe the <hi>Dead Man;</hi> but this ſhall not be the <hi>Dead Man</hi> which the <hi>White King</hi> ſhall raiſe; for he is not a <hi>Dead Man,</hi> but to the Hopes and Expectations of the People he is Dead only, but ſhall riſe again.</p>
            <p>This is directly hit at the <hi>Union</hi> of the Two Kingdoms, and cannot be interpreted to mean any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ther thing, but what the <hi>Dead Man</hi> is wou'd look <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>hich is very particular, and wonderfully remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in deed, is the Sign given us of thoſe times that is when <hi>Falſe Prophets</hi> ſhall ariſe and pretend to aiſe the <hi>Dead Man,</hi> before ever the other <hi>Dead Man</hi> hat was meant, was ever thought to make ſuch a <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> This is worth a ſerious Reflection to hink that juſt at a time when theſe <hi>Falſe Prophets</hi> pretend to raiſe <hi>Emes,</hi> one of their pretended <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets,</hi> which is their <hi>Dead Man,</hi> the <hi>White King,</hi> in he <hi>Propheſie,</hi> is pretending to raiſe to us, the People of the <hi>Union,</hi> another <hi>Dead Man,</hi> contrary to all our Thoughts, our Apprehenſions, or Expectations,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0388500700:5"/>
and who this <hi>Dead Man</hi> is, the next Paragraph of the <hi>Propheſie</hi> ſhows.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Dead Man</hi> is the <hi>Lyon</hi>'s <hi>Whelp,</hi> which the <hi>Eagle</hi> had drove away from the <hi>Old Lyon</hi> before.</p>
            <p>This part of the <hi>Propheſie</hi> is explain'd by that which foretold the <hi>Revolution</hi> by the coming of an <hi>Eagle</hi> out of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> which was the then Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> afterwards our Glorious <hi>Reſtorer</hi> King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> who came to catch the <hi>Old Lyon</hi>'s <hi>Whelp,</hi> which may be plainly underſtood of the then <hi>Pretended Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> who is afterwards all along call'd the <hi>Dead Man,</hi> which very emphatically ſhows us, He is a Perſon <hi>Dead</hi> and loſt to all Reaſonable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. But this is the <hi>Dead Man</hi> which the <hi>Eagle</hi> had drove away from the <hi>Old Lyon,</hi> as this <hi>Pretender</hi> was driven from K. <hi>James,</hi> before he <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated</hi> the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore he is a <hi>Dead Man</hi> indeed that is excluded all hopes of Reigning, by the Crown of <hi>Great Britain</hi>'s being Settled on the Houſe of <hi>Hannover,</hi> and in a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Succeſſion</hi> for ever, ſo that he is actually <hi>Dead</hi> to the Law. Therefore we ſhall proceed to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in the next place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Buſineſs that the</hi> Dead Man <hi>is ſent about by the</hi> White King. And the <hi>White King</hi> having War with all the Nations round about him, ſetting up one King, and pulling down another, at laſt raiſes up the <hi>Dead Man,</hi> which was the <hi>Old Lyon</hi>'s <hi>Whelp,</hi> and furniſhes him with Wooden Horſes to carry him to his Native Country, there to aſſault it, and deſtroy the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the hardneſs of their Hearts, and their Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in not beliening that the <hi>Dead Man</hi> ſhou'd come again, whom they ſpued out from amongſt them long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
