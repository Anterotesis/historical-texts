            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE veneration I bear to the memory of Doctor Goldſmith, has drawn me into the preſent publication; and the ſentiments of affection to be found in his Dedication of the DESERTED VILLAGE, have induced me to inſcribe <hi>this</hi> Elegy to Sir Joſhua Reynolds; who will naturally receive with kindneſs whatever is deſigned, as a teſtimony of juſtice, to a Friend that is no more.</p>
            <p>In contemplating the death of this excellent man, and admirable poet, I have been led to contemplate likewiſe the fate of others; for within a very few years our literary loſſes have been fatally multiplied, and many of the moſt valuable members have been ſuddenly lopped off from ſcience and ſociety. In purſuit of this undertaking, where the ſame pathetic ſubject was to be considered to the end, I reſolved to ſet out upon an irregular principle, that without enchaining myſelf to any critical uniformity, I might have ſcope and latitude for whatever varieties of verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication ſhould fall in my way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0134303900:4"/>As I was to deplore the loſs of different writers, each of which poſſeſſed very ſtrongly a marking origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, I thought it beſt to write a ſort of Epitaph upon each: accordingly, the following Verſes are intended as ſo many ſeparate Imitations of the ſtyle and manner of the Authors which they comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate.</p>
            <p>That the occaſion which produced the Elegy, might not loſe the ſtrength of the impreſſion, by delay—for alas, the traces of ſorrow for the loſs of the learned, are ſoon worn out by the tumults of life—I hurried the compoſition to the preſs, the moment I could withdraw my hand from the manuſcript; the whole of which was begun and finiſhed within a few hours after the news reached me, that Dr. Goldſmith was dead.</p>
            <p>But I beg, Sir, you will excuſe the length of this Addreſs, and believe me to be</p>

               <q>Nor, in lamenting the havock, which Death hath triumphantly made (continued GENIUS) in the letter'd generation, can HAWKESWORTH, be forgotten: A name which is particularly endear'd to me, by the affection which its owner bore to virtue and to ſcience.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0134303900:29"/>
Every ſtroke of his pen, correſponding with every idea of his mind, however playful, or however pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic, always terminated in the moſt uſeful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: that knowledge which might regulate the conduct of life, or afford tranquillity and quietude at the hour of expiration. The ardour which uniformly animated his endeavours, gave conſtant vigour to his thought, activity to his powers, and dignity to his ſentiment: Nor did his excellence ariſe ſo much from the ambition which panted after fame, and aim'd at popularity—which appeal'd to the acclamations of the mob, or ſought the diſtinctions of this world; as from the hearty hope of contributing, in whatever degree, to the inveſtigation of truth, the amendment of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the rectitude of the mind. Of thoſe who have acquir'd a literary immortality, there are few who could diſpute with my HAWKESWORTH, ſtrength of ſenſe, or elevation of expreſſion; and ſtill fewer have given to the world ſo valuable, or ſo copious a fund of virtuous entertainment. Amidſt all the efforts of his intellect, whether his inſtructions were prepared in the dreſs of hiſtory — or convey'd in the vehicle of fabulous narration—whether they aſſum'd the graver ſtyle of argumentative profundity, or whether they adopted the ſtill deeper reſearches of philoſophical raciocination; —their conſtant greatneſs of deſign was equally appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0134303900:30"/>
and the promotion of virtue was always ſtrongly mark'd in the language of the writer. My dear, my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted HAWKESWORTH, was indeed never long ſeduc'd by any temptations, or abſtracted by any ſcientific allurements, from thoſe views which are alone of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic importance, and which he well knew, would retain that importance, when all, that now flutters to the fancy, plays upon the paſſions, and faſcinates the heart, ſhall confeſs their inſignificance, and fly like the atom, that is driven before the tempeſt.</q>
